4159540,1,B003NHMYHY,"I saw this film at a drive-in from the backseat of my parents 1965 Impala as an naive 8 years old. Even as a a completely undiscerning kid completely enthralled with Star Wars, science fiction, and terrible Saturday morning cartoons like Jabbajaws, I still thought this movie was pure and utter crap.

In fact it was during this movie that something ""clicked"" and for the first time in my young life I actually processed and judged a piece of entertainment to be awful.

I was exposed to some extremely bad entertainment (borderline child abuse) in the mid to late 70s and early 80s at the drive-in, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orca-The-Killer-Whale/dp/B0002I832M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orca - The Killer Whale</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Black-Hole/dp/B0001I55SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Black Hole</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oh-God-Book-II/dp/B0006J28LO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oh God! Book II</a>. Starcrash was the piece of drek that put me over the edge. It was after ""Star Trash"", how I as an 8 year old described it, that I began to awaken and not let TV and movies just wash over me and actually think about what I was seeing.

When I re-visit some of the cartoons and films I cherished as a child and see how terrible most of them are, and then think that this film actually elicited disgust and hatred from me as an eight year old, then I know this is one of the very worst films ever made.",1282089600,7,1572,5.885964912280702
4159541,1,B003NHMYHY,"I am thankful for having seen this film, if only for providing me with a ready answer to the question: ""What's the worst movie ever made?"" ""Why, that's an easy one--Starcrash!""
This movie was a psychological assault against the viewer on so many levels. Writing, bad. Acting, bad. Models, special effects, sound effects, cinematography, editing, concept,... everything was just so, so, SO BAD.
You would think that after all that badness, maybe it would find its way around to being good again, wouldn't you? Sucker! Just when you think that maybe it has turned into some of the best camp you've ever seen, this movie just ruins it for you by getting even worse. Then, as you sit, stupefied that such a seeming impossiblity has occurred right before your eyes, you know you'll be walking away from this movie with the pure, unassailable knowledge of just one thing. You will never be able to shake the stench of this rotten-tomato-of-a-movie from your mind. I saw this in the theater, when it first came out and I physically flinch when people mention it. I can't say for sure that I will never see it again, but nobody I know hates me enough to tie me to a chair and prop my eyelids open while it plays. (There you go; buy ""A Clockwork Orange"". It sticks with you, too, but in a good movie way.)
If this review prevents just one person from buying this movie, I feel my life will have had purpose.",1282003200,4,1398,4.551587301587301
4159542,3,B003NHMYHY,"I remember seeing this movie on many a Saturday afternoon when I was young. Back then I loved it. Today I am fully aware of its shortcomings. That being said I still enjoy it, only this time the ""cool"" factor has dropped down several notches since I was a kid and the ""cheesy"" factor has kicked in. This movie might be fun for different reasons than I had before, but it's still fun.

I find it interesting that this movie is being released under the Roger Corman's Cult Classics moniker considering Corman had NOTHING to do with it. It was directed (and written) by Luigi Cozzi. It was originally conceived as a Harryhausen Sinbad type adventure in space rip-off, but then Star Wars came along so Luigi upped the production schedule and added George Lucas' classic on the list of stuff he borrowed from.

Bear in mind this is one of those Italian-made productions and it was obviously trying to capitalize on the success of Star Wars. Starcrash is definitely along the lines of a classic space opera, and when I say that I mean everything including tiny budgets and short production schedules. Star Wars it aint, but if you think about it Starcrash is truer to the genre.

The movie takes ideas from a lot of places. Of course there is the aforementioned Harryhausen ideas when ""borrowing"" concepts for their stop motion model work. The sword fight with the robots and the giant Amazon robot are direct rip offs of two notable scenes by the master Harryhausen himself. Of course Star Wars got milked too, but not nearly as much as you might think. Most likely the light sabers were ripped off and that villain's name, Zarth Arn, sounds way too close to not be derivative of Star Wars' Vader. The plot kinda sits there and some of the scenes make very little sense. I guess that's okay since the script throws out some major cornball dialog.

Production values are abysmal in this film. The spaceship models look like they are various household items glued together with parts of model kits (including the plastic frames you pull the parts off of). The stop motion animations are extremely choppy. The laser effects... well they are kinda cool, but definitely dated. Everything about the special effects scream college film project.

The acting varies from good to hammy. Caroline Monroe is known for doing roles like this one and she pulls it off just like she always does. Christopher Plummer... man that guy can make the worst lines ever written sound noble and poignant. That's exactly what he did here. David Hasselhoff is in this one as well and he doesn't do a bad job if you can get around the eye makeup.

Now this movie has gotten the DVD treatment before and now Corman is releasing it on his Cult Classics collection as both Blu-Ray and DVD. That's about all the information that has been released so far. No news on whether or not this will be a remastered edition. No word on what features and extras will be included. Best I can do is let you know what's out there, and so far the best model to go on is the Collector's Edition DVD.

The Collector's Edition actually had 5.1 DTS audio, however the caveat to that is it's a 5.1 digital master of a monophonic movie. Take that however you like, but the CE audio wasn't all that amazing. Will this Bly-Ray do anything to improve that? The Collector's Edition also has some interesting features such as a making of documentary that I think came from a television program that was released in Italy way back then. It also has a documentary/interview with director Luigi Cozzi. Will this Blu-Ray have any of this stuff and/or more? I'll update this review as I learn more.

I know I make it all sound pretty bad, but when you put it all together the movie does have its charm. Cheesy charm and some authentic movie charm as well. I'm surprised Mystery Science Theater 3K didn't do a number on this movie. Watch it with some friends and you will all have a great time poking at it. For you classic space opera fans this movie is a hoot as well. Especially if you are very forgiving of all the limitations I mentioned. Definitely worth a look for any science fiction fan with an open mind.",1276473600,41,4146,4.570659488559892
4159543,5,B003NHMYHY,"This film simply lacked ""true"" space opera common sense and seemed from the outset to be nothing but an awful Star Wars (1977) copy.  I was hesitant to go as high as 5 stars but I suppose the basic premise of the film is acceptable enough, it is an enjoyably awful, cheese space film.

I find Starcrash (1978) very stirring and exciting. At its heart, it is a close relative of the klutzy Italian giallo films, a swashbuckling Star epic full of political space color, ridiculous special effects, dumb intrigue, and moral danger in space. Christopher Plummer emerges as a memorable villain, and David Hasselhoff's presence is enough to further increase the mystique of the Hasselhoff cheese legacy.  I sense some unbalance in this movie.  The script is so bad that it makes Marjoe Gortner and Joe Spinell look lame but Caroline Munro wearing a bikini is hot.

Starcrash (1978) is underrated cheese and more imaginative than most cheese space films ever shot.

Not only does this movie entertain kids of all ages but it holds up well to repeat viewings and earns the right to be called a ""cheese space classic"".",1276387200,40,1109,4.75
4159544,2,B003NHMYHY,"Caroline Munro runs around half-naked in this thing. That's why I gave it two stars. Hopefully Christopher Plummer was paid well for this turkey. If you want a STAR WARS ripoff really bad, this is a really bad ripoff. Robert Tessier plays a sort of good guy cop. Liked him more in HARD TIMES where old Chuck Bronson wails away on his pointy bald noggin. Wasn't Marjoe Gortner some kind of preacher? David Hasselhoff ... 'nuff said. Interesting note, they dub Caroline Munro. Curious, she actually does speak ENGLISH  Hey it does has a John Barry Score.",1253404800,,552,4.690721649484536
4159545,5,B003NHMYHY,"This movie is so bad it's good. First off, David Hasselhoff is in it. The stars look like they've been made out of Christmas lights. The whole plot is bizarre and incredibly bad. Sure, this movie has no business being compared to the great sci-fi films of all time like ""Star Wars"", ""Serenity"", or ""Blade Runner"", but if you want to laugh, get this film!",1244678400,3,354,4.461538461538462
4159546,2,B003NHMYHY,"Well, Starcrash was obviously rolled out to cash in on the success of Star Wars...but using a fraction of the budget and talent. I laughed all the way through it, and I hope you will to. But for god's sake don't start watching it under the impression that you are going to be in for a sci-fi epic...it's more like a home movie!

The film starts with a mysterious space massacre, then cuts to Caroline Munro as Stella Crash (!), sexy space bandit/smuggler, on the run from the authorities. Together with her team mate (Marjoe Gortner, from many non-starring roles in other random 70's and 80's stuff), she evades capture and jets off into new adventures. Right away you know you are in for a rubbish 100 minutes, as every special effect (even in the first 10 minutes) is woefully cheap. Every set is minute and made of plastic. All external shots of spaceships look like they are made of plastic. ""Space"" is depicted by multi-coloured fairy lights. But that's not really the main issue. The biggest crazy feature of Starcrash is the script. The only things that happen in the film are action events. Flow of movie goes something like this.
Course set for alien planet. Arrive and meet crazy aliens. Exciting battle ensues. Witty one liners upon victory. Ship bombarded by alien attack. Outrun aliens while spouting witty one liners. Land on another alien planet. Rinse and repeat. Now in a normal movie what I wrote above would be a summary of the action. In Starcrash that's the full movie! No connecting shots, establishing shots, character development shots, it's just bam-bam-bam, scene after scene of fun and action. Now for anyone under the age of 10, that is probably movie gold, but for someone who wants a semblance of reality, it's quite bewildering. It's like watching a film in it's ""best bits"" highlight version, except that it's like this solidly for nearly two hours!!
One scene illustrates this perfectly: quite early on Caroline Munro says ""I'll set a course through hyper-space. What would normally be a journey lasting two months , should only take us about 2 hours ...(and then, in almost the same breath and in the same scene)...We've arrived!"". That's cutting out the surplus taken to an extreme!

This might be ok if what we were looking at was top class quality, but it's pretty lame in every way. The acting is hammy to the extreme. The sets are wafer thin. The dialogue is brief and to the point. The monsters and aliens are...oh dear. Actually, though, I did love the stop -motion animated monsters, although they are a bit crappy and not well integrated, it just shows that SOMEONE did dedicate some time and effort into this film. Stop-motion is never a short-cut in movies, and I always appreciate the efforts put into the effect when watching it.

As I said the film is  definitely fun to watch, there really is never a dull moment. To show that I am not a complete Grinch, I am going to list a few genuine plus points of the movie: Firstly Caroline Munro was probably at her best looking at the time this film was made, she really looks stunning (I can't say the same for her acting skills, but let's concentrate on the good here).  Stop-motion monsters (always a winner). Oh, and the bad guy's spaceship looks like giant hand (I loved this!).

Now let me list some stuff that is good because it's so bad: When the good guys attack the bad guys, their modus operandi is to fire small pods onto the bad guy's ship. Each pod contains 2 (TWO) soldiers who leap out of the pod and immediately start firing weapons wildly.  The pods land right inside the bad guy's ship by (wait for it)..SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOWS! So like, the loss of air into the vacuum of space is not an issue here? And anyway, what a strange way to launch an offensive in space, by firing pods containing armed soldiers through windows. Seems very dangerous and unlikely to work to me! There's more...towards the climax, Stella pilots a space station the size of about 3 planets into a collision with the bad guy's ship. At about minus 3 seconds before impact, she escapes by...jumping out of a window. In another scene, Stella is in a penal colony labour camp. There's some scuffles and a bit of an uprising. Caroline watches for a second, then ducks under a duct pipe. In the very next shot she's running along the banks of some reedy river! Low security or what?? Shall I go on? The male bandit/hero (Marjoe Gortner) can see into the future. However he NEVER uses this power to win against the bad guys! (Apparently it's ""against the law"". This from a space pirate!). Also, the main good guy has a special power that can stop the flow of time. Wow! He uses this to get the heros off a ship that is about to explode. However he NEVER uses this power again to beat the bad guys! On that note, I must mention that the main bad guy is played like Darth Vadar (with no mask) by Joe Spinell, with full pantomime lines like ""Soon I will rule the entire Galaxy! Mwahahah!"" There's also a CP30 comedy robot clone too (no CP30 sadly, I guess one was enough), and some outerspace dog fights that re-cycle the same shot of 5 blue enemy ships  (zooming around and then exploding) about a dozen times.

Well that's all I can say really. I spent a fun 2 hours watching this craziness. Every line of the script was seemingly written by a five-year old. Only the most obvious dialogue, just enough to give you a vague idea of what's happening, is ever spoken. And the witty one-liners of course.",1244678400,5,5482,4.568667344862665
4159547,1,B003NHMYHY,"In the 1970s, your first clue that you'd bought a ticket to a turkey was the appearance of Marjoe Gortner, who probably can't act dead convincingly.

Star Crash, an attempt to cash in on the success of movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", wins the Velveeta Crown of Cheese. You name it, it's got it....weak plot, lame dialogue with even worse delivery, and lousy special effects (particularly the colored starfield) and DREADFUL acting.

The best reaction you'll have watching this one is to scratch your head and wonder WHAT???? Christopher Plummer is doing in this movie. Was he broke?

Pure Italian rip off Sci-Fi glory! I saw this when I was a mere 13 back in 1980 on cable TV. I liked it, but I never considered it to be an equal to the phenomenal ""Star Wars"" from 1977 even back then. I find it entertaining and campy. You have to admit, if you like campy science fiction movies as I do, this is definitely one of them. You can't take it seriously. I mean did you take all the '50s Sci-Fi that way? lol I am a big fan of Caroline Munro so I remember this one with great fondness. (She is a genuine Bond Girl from The Spy Who Loved Me). So, that in itself is why I like it just to see her in her glory. She runs around in this sleek black outfit worthy for a space adventure. Remember, there is no underwear in space! lol
If you like cheaply made science fiction movies that will get you laughs, this is one for you, but DON'T expect it to match up to anything in the SW universe. This movie is the result of an Italian movie lover of Science Fiction and adventure movies. I often look at it as an Italian homage to our American counterpart of Star Wars.

4159652,3,B003NHMYHY,"Sometimes I'm okay with a little cheese. Other times, not so much. This comes off as a low-rent version of Star Wars, but it could just as easily be seen as a play off Zardoz and Barbarella. The psychedelic special effects appear a number of times, so I'm sure the budget wasn't too big. The leading lady is attractive and energetic. Her partner in crime has an odd tan, and for some reason the police robot sounds like a wild west sheriff... The deeper you dig into the details, the stranger it gets.
The story isn't horrible, and the effects are kind of cool, in a tiny-budget-but-what still-would-look-cool kind of way. Most bad movies are destined to be bad from the start, while most good movies have an enormous amount of planning behind them, regardless of budget. With a few story tweaks and a bigger budget, this might have been pretty good. As it is, you'll either laugh or cringe at some of the choices, but if you like the 70s vibe, and you've okay with the cheese, this is a great choice. If you don't have much patience for that stuff, you'll probably start thinking about watching something else within the first few minutes. I happened to watch it on a day that I enjoyed the weird choices and silly details.

4159654,3,B003NHMYHY,"This is a cheeseball 1978 ripoff of Star Wars, Star Trek and even some elements of Flash Gordon and Battlestar Galactica - and in it I certainly see elements anticipating the decades-later ""Steampunk"" Genre. The acting is wooden, 1970s-classic, though I always see certain depths in Christopher Plummer's acting, even when he is not given intelligent dialogue, that show talent far beyond where he finds himself. The plot of this movie is okay, but the dialogue is less than inspired and even less than intelligent: on a ship, things aren't ""To the right of us!"" they're ""starboard side!"" The villain and his men, with the obscuring smoke of battle all around: ""Over there! It's over there!"" More excusable is Acton trying to explain to his mere mortal friends that one cannot change the nature of things or escape 'destiny,' that he cannot use his apparently pure clairvoyance to change what must come to be...though to say one ""cannot change the future because it is against the law"" isn't quite right; we change the future every time we make a choice! In this movie, you won't see the brilliance that set 'Star Wars' so far beyond its Sci-Fi brethren of the era; but you will see lightspeed travel called 'hyperspace' and lightsabers NOT called lightsabers. Above all, you'll see the idealistic optimism of the era. All in all a fun bit of Sci-Fi fluff. Safe for kids, too.",1413936000,,1376,4.810126582278481

But, I have to give credit where credit is due, namely, those fans who loved the film so much to (have wasted their time) putting this jam-packed DVD tribute set together.

You get: commentary; interviews; analysis of the musical score (which is also dreadful); deleted and alternate scenes -- the whole enchilada for fans of this movie.

A booklet comes with the set in which some fanboy of the movie, named Stephen Romano, writes a very detailed and passionate treatise on why it's one of his most favorite films of all time: its ""forbidden"" nature . . . its campy hommage to American sci-fi . . . etc., etc.  For all of that, Romano can't understand why the film is largely unknown, and has been largely unavailable on DVD -- until NOW! (Newsflash, Steve! . . . because it stunk.)

""Star Crash"" was an attempt by Italian filmmakers to ""ride the coattails"" of the blockbuster, ""Star Wars,"" and of a TRUE ""cult classic,"" ""Battlestar Galactica.""  Except for enjoying the estimable presence of the legendary Christopher Plummer as well as having the trivial pleasure of seeing Mein Herr David Hasselhoff in an early role, there's nothing more to see here, Folks . . . move along . . . the rest of the Cast and Story and Whatnot are not even worth the time (1 hr., 30 min., if you were wondering).

I only bought this DVD set on Amazon, because I wanted to see the movie, which is indeed hard to get otherwise.  Now that I've seen it, it will find its way to my local library where, at least, people can enjoy its awfulness for free!

So, for the Movie itself: 1 star; for the effort in bringing it to DVD: 3.",1408665600,,1726,4.485623003194888

4159705,4,B003NHMYHY,"My advice is just meditate on my title. But if you MUST have a review...

You can find people on The Innanette that call this ""the worst movie ever made."" Stephen Romano, who does both (!) full-length commentary tracks for this two-disc set, defends this film as ""important art,"" and by the time you hear him out, you'll lean toward his side of the argument. It's a mess, no denying - the script is confused, the performances are jarringly inappropriate, and the look is bargain-basement and yet amazingly dreamlike and even..beautiful. The cheap, cheap stars and 3rd-grade-art-class spaceships somehow actually take you in to the movie, while still generating the yuks. This movie doesn't take itself seriously one bit, yet it's no spoof. See it, laugh your butt off, and marvel at the colors and heart inside this elementary school diorama of a movie. David Hasselhoff is in it. With lots of makeup. I probably just sold 20 copies of the disc right there.

The commentary tracks are a huge plus - you don't just get a Classic Bad Film, you get to hear from someone who loves a movie unconditionally and explains why, and it's hard not to get caught up in his enthusiasm. It's not quite the way Paul Karasik's editorial coda transformed I SHALL DESTROY ALL THE CIVILIZED PLANETS! from a collection of lost comic books into a powerful work of literary nonfic (add that one to your list, btw - amazing), but there's something close enough going on that I was reminded of it. Part of the Show, then, is seeing a fan's love for the unloveable, and damn it if it doesn't affect you, too, a bit.

Caroline Munroe looks great in a skimpy costume. Her lines, and Gortner's, are delivered as if they have no relationship to each other. In fairness to the actors, it appears the direction was bad or non-existent. The overall effect is so bad it's fascinating.  I skimmed through most of the move after watching the open, only watching parts of other scenes.  Never saw David Hasselhoff, who is also credited.

4159732,1,B003NHMYHY,"This is a bad film. Unquestionably. It's a cheap imitation of Star Wars made by people who didn't understand Star Wars.

The acting ranges from hilariously bad to hilariously overplayed (apparently Christopher Plummer agreed to the role solely because it would give him the chance to stay in Rome).

Having said that, this is one of the best bad movies I've ever seen. There are a large number of incredibly funny moments (mostly unintentional) and the plot never stays in one place long enough to be boring. It's entertainingly bad instead of unwatchably bad.

The first half of the movie had her wearing this hot bikini number, but because of possible tv syndication they had her covered up for the second half. I'm thinking they should of kept the bikini because as far as I know it was never syndicated, trust me I know because I watched a lot of tv as a kid. but other then that just a blatant rip off. the one good thing is it makes me appreciate the original battlestar galactica and buck rogers from the 70's.",1395446400,,846,4.196319018404908

Caroline Munro is lovely. But let's not pretend this isn't just a Star Wars knock-off, because that's exactly what it was at the time (1978), and the script writer and director had exactly that in mind. I don't watch this film to laugh at how bad it is, I really truly enjoy it because it takes me back to my childhood in many ways, back to a time when movies could be simple. It's not multi-layered, not complex, not social satire, it's just fun, cheesy sci-fi with bad effects, bad acting, a terrible plot, and I love every minute of it. And, taking the Star Wars comparison a bit further, I can't help but wonder how much better the Star Wars trilogy would have been with Carolyn Munro as Princess Leah rather than the short, sarcastic, world-weary Carrie Fisher (imagine Munro in Jabba's Palace...). Ah, but I digress. Munro is a lovely actress, and what I really enjoy about her performance here is a total lack of guile. And, yes, David Hasselhoff is every bit as bad here as he is in everything else, which is just so over-the-top, laugh out loud great!

I was hesitant to go as high as 5 stars but I suppose the basic premise of the film is acceptable enough, it is an enjoyably awful, cheese space film.

I find Starcrash (1978) very stirring and exciting. At its heart, it is a close relative of the klutzy Italian giallo films, a swashbuckling Star epic full of political space color, ridiculous special effects, dumb intrigue, and moral danger in space. Christopher Plummer emerges as a memorable villain, and David Hasselhoff's presence is enough to further increase the mystique of the Hasselhoff cheese legacy. I sense some unbalance in this movie. The script is so bad that it makes Marjoe Gortner and Joe Spinell look lame but Caroline Munro wearing a bikini is hot.

Starcrash (1978) is underrated cheese and more imaginative than most cheese space films ever shot.

Could have been a glam rocker, with that pretty face, ha-ha. Rather liked Caroline as Pussy Galore, and although this flick could have been better it was still excellent cheese. Definitely a rainy Saturday film, especially without any commercial interruption, but it does drag in parts and you have to be patient with others. I give it a 4 for the retro, the fact that they really attempted to fill a gap for the scifi doods who have a sense of humor.

4159771,5,B003NHMYHY,"If you are a Roger Corman fan, you will love ""Starcrash.""  Roger Corman, as most serious film buffs know, holds a special place in the pantheon of Hollywood producers and directors for having cranked out some of the cheapest, goofiest B-movies ever made. And lots of them.  Yet, this same 87-year-old King of the Trashy B-flick is also responsible for kick-starting the careers of industry greats like Jack Nicholson, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard and James Cameron.

This crafty, low-budget work, written and directed by an Italian chap named Luigi Cozzi, also known as ""Lewis Coates,"" was released in Italian a year after the premier of  George Lucas' original ""Star Wars,"" which wasn't so original after all, as anyone who's familiar with the original ""Flash Gordon"" movie serials, staring Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe, would know.  All the same, it's great fun comparing the special effects used by Cozzi, a.k.a. Coates, and George Lucas way back there in the early 1970s, when one might convincingly argue everyone in the movie business was stoned.  Who could have conceived of the great sci-fi films yet to come such as ""Transformers,"" ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space,"" or the ""Terminator""?  In 1975, Arnold Schwarzenegger was barely known even to gym-boys as Mr. Olympia. Dumb-bells are very low tech, not sci-fi at all.  Maybe we shouldn't care.

The Italian version of ""Starcrash"" was released as ""Scontri Stellari Oltre La Terza Dimensione,"" which Google translates as ""stellar clashes beyond the third dimension,""  a little long for the typical movie marquee; so not surprisingly it was renamed ""The Adventures of Stella Star,"" capitalizing on the movie's star, Catherine Munro, a beautiful, not-so-talented-English actress who wears a little leather costume through most of the film.

Her co-star is none other than Marjoe Gortner who, when four-years-old, was billed as the world's youngest ordained minister. Yes! Some sci-fi aficionados might argue that's not enough to warrant five stars, however this wonderful bit of camp also features the very talented Christopher Plummer and the not-so-talented David Hasselhoff, who later came to understand that his acting skills were displayed best when playing opposite a talking car or beach blanket bimbos. In this film, bimboness is not in question.

If the cast were not enough to temp a potential viewer to invest 90 minutes of his or her film-watching time, what would?  Given the cast, costumes and ""special"" effects, there is no reason to bring up ""plot"".  As typical of the oeuvre of Mssr. Corman, the plot really doesn't matter; a concept clearly understood by Hollywood today.  For this reason alone, some might call ""Starcrash"" a break-through, or a trend-setter. Although that's not likely.  It is clearly, however, a non-digital, campy, low concept, absent-mindedly edited, second feature: a great example of seventies sci-fi flotsam.

4159776,4,B003NHMYHY,"Wow.

My wife and I just watched the movie ""Star Crash"", an Italian movie released around the same time as Star Wars. Allegedly it was influenced more by Flash Gordon and Barbarella, but I think there was some definite cross-pollination with Star Wars during the making of the movie. What is clear though is the attention to detail to the special effects and stop-motion animation (which were stellar). What's not clear is if anyone actually paid attention to any continuity throughout the movie (or even overall plot for that matter). I'm not going into any detail on the movie itself (to do so would just ruin the shear ""WTF"" moments of the film, including one that had JoDee and I both say ""WHAT?!?"" at the same time (and had me subsequently rolling on the floor laughing hysterically for a good minute or so). Suffice to say this is a movie that has some amazingly beautiful scenes and captures the silver-age comic book aesthetics better than any film I've seen thus far, but then ruins it with plot devices, physics, and outright ""huh"" moments that takes any pretense of suspension of disbelief and tears them out without a second's thought. Some have compared it to Plan Nine from Outer Space, which isn't totally fair to either movie. Plan Nine was comic book storytelling with all of the enthusiasm but none of the budget or skill to make it happen. Star Crash spends lavishly on scenes that don't really need it, and grows frugal on scenes that could have used some more effects. What could have easily been done with an actor in a suit is rendered in absolutely stunning stop-motion animation. Soldiers don't just die; they spark and explode and catch fire. Mechanical robot golems wage lavish metal sword fights against our hero who wields a laser sword that previously dispatched many cavemen with a single swipe. it makes no sense, and makes no apologies for making no sense. it just is.

Plus it also stars David Hasselhoff.

Star Crash is a movie that reeks ""what the hell just happened"" but does so with style. It makes no sense, and doesn't care to explain the plot. It's cheesy, overblown, and ludicrous; just like the comic books it tries to portray. It's not a great movie, or even a good movie, but I don't care. Will I recommend people see it? I'm not sure. But I know that I'm glad to have seen it.

4159779,5,B003NHMYHY,"There's something magical about this movie, I can't quite put my finger on it. But it leaves you feeling uplifted, and smiling from ear to ear. It is easily the best Luigi Cozzi film. Everything just comes together in a way that is purely entertaining and sometimes moving - ""Star Crash"" possesses an innocence that is quite affecting.

A few things I love about this movie:

1. The Cast: Where else can you see a scene played out by Caroline Munroe, David Hasselhoff and Christopher Plummer? All three are wonderful in the movie. Like the cast of the original Star Wars (1977) they never play the story for camp, nor do they make the mistake of trying to elevate the material or turn it into something it is not. They're having fun so we have fun too; they all strike the perfect balance. Elsewhere, we have Joe Spinell (from the Godfather movies) as an evil Count; Robert Tessier giving a strange but interesting performance as an alien space-cop; and the gorgeous Nadia Cassini who shows up briefly as an Amazon Queen. Notable performances are given by Hamilton Camp as the voice of ""Robot Ell"", a truly memorable and likable character; more intriguing is Marjoe Gortner as Akton, a mysterious super-human apparently modeled after Paul Atreides (Dune) and Luke Skywalker - Marjoe was a child preacher and later produced a film exposing bogus faith healers - he brings an easy and likable spiritual quality to Akton, and lends a strangely powerful undertone to the line, ""Have faith and never give up hope.""

2. The Characters: Caroline Munroe is ""Barbarella"" in all but name, playing ""Stella Star"" with wide-eyed, infectious enthusiasm and irresistible charm. She looks great in all of her costumes and is clearly having the time of her life. She's an infinitely better ""Barbarella"" than awful Jane Fonda, and ""Star Crash"" is closer to a great ""Barbarella"" movie than the smarmy, sleazy, ugly movie that was produced in 1968. Akton is the perfect messianic hero, stripped of all unnecessary baggage, presented as a child would imagine it. Robot Ell is funny and endearing. The Emperor is wise and magisterial. Prince Simon is heroic and likable. It's a winning combination of simple, enjoyable characters.

3. The Visuals: When Luigi Cozzi is on form, his visuals are a joy to watch. George Lucas and Ridley Scott are masterful illustrators, laying on details and niggling over fine points. Cozzi is a mad childlike savant, splashing the screen with color and images with wild abandon, filling his films with surreal tableaus that stand in stark contrast to the often poorly executed technical effects. He never again captured the seamless quality of ""Star Crash's"" visuals. The rickety stop motion is bursting with energy and charm, the model work looks like something out of a Universal ""Flash Gordon"" serial, the heavens glow with multicolored stars, recalling Dick Calkin's ""Buck Rogers"" Sunday strips and the bold colors of Silver Age DC and 1970's Marvel comics. Luigi's love of technicolor films shines through bright and clear, perfectly capturing the gaudy, vivid palette of films like ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Time Machine"", ""This Island Earth"" and ""Forbidden Planet"". The images crackle with imagination and life and are always exciting to watch.

4. The Score: John Barry's music grows on you with subsequent viewings. He offers up a swinging 70's era theme that in no way apes the famed John  Williams ""Star Wars"" fanfare, and buffets the fun story and vivid imagery with a delirious, dreamy score that sweeps the viewer into a lush world of fantasy. It's a gorgeous and memorable score.

The 2-Disc DVD set presents a good transfer of the film and plenty of lavish extras. If you love space opera and fantasy films, add this to your collection. It is certainly more enjoyable than James Cameron's lugubrious ""Avatar"" or other similar, recent, expensive and pretentious bore-fests. ""Star Crash"" is unique, memorable, and most of all, just plain fun!",1355616000,7,3966,4.972850678733032
4159780,5,B003NHMYHY,"StarCrash is a fantastic movie in the sense that it is absolutely unbelievable. Not even for a moment was I swept away by the story.  But the darned thing is trying so hard and the performers are acting with such sincerity that you feel like a parent cheering on your kid in the school play.  StarCrash is a mishmash of pulp sci-fi themes and ideas, lovingly thrown together with reckless abandon.  Elements and characters are blatantly ripped off from other 60's and 70's sci-fi movies.  It's hokey, childish and very silly with lots of pretty colors, a bizarre cast including Christopher Plummer and David Hasselhof, and strangely, a surprisingly decent score.  Although the humor of StarCrash is unintentional, it's clear that the cast and crew were having plenty of fun crafting this Star Wars ripoff and it comes through onscreen.  The space ship models are so horribly made that you can actually recognize models parts used from other kits.  (I'm sure I recognize parts from a Panzer tank model I made in 6th grade stuck to the side of the Emperor's ship-- the one that can HALT THE FLOW OF TIME!!!)  The plot is silly and just serves to keep things moving as the heroine and her friends bounce from one ridiculous situation to another.  There is bad stop motion animation, bad light sabers, bad funny robot with southern accent (?!?), lots of metallic spray paint and Christmas tree lights, and plenty of quotable bad dialogue.  Somehow all of this low budget ambition is so well intentioned that it wins you over.  By the end of the film I knew that I would watch this again and again, like the best episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, the more you watch it the funnier it becomes.",1354579200,,1695,4.6925675675675675

The science behind this film is about the worst with one of the nosiest space vacuums imaginable.

Joe Spinell as the evil Count Zarth Arn brought a tear to my eye as an MST 3000 gift from the gods. I will say in a comparison to ""Star Wars"" the robot had more personality than 3CPO.

4159783,2,B003NHMYHY,"For someone to give this movie five stars it trying to say that there is no movie better.  One stars means that is no movie worse. This is just to put the review in prospective. That said it is matter of taste and perception. Now let's move on.

For people that buys films for esoteric purposes such as ogling Caroline Munro be prepared for a disproportionately heavy bottomed  body by an actor that turned down Playboy magazine and any film that forces her to display her birthday suit. Maybe the fashion style will come back.

The film does have some actors with a universal resume. One that comes to mind is Christopher Plummer. Christopher said that his worse movie was ""The sound of Music"" (1965) in which he sang ""Edelweiss.""  So ipso facto to him this is not his worst film.

But wait! There is more. David Hasselhoff if you can consider him as more. This was probably the film that helped land him the part in the Baywatch Nights (TV series) (1997). But I am not sure.

There is a plot in this presentation. Stella Star (Caroline Munro) famous for this Corman movie and books, and her sidekick Akton (Marjoe Gortner) a couple of smugglers, in the spirit of Han Solo and Chewbacca, are tasked with finding the evil Count Zarth Arn, and rescuing the son of the Emperor. In the process they are betrayed by friends, restrained by scantily clad female baddies, sunspots, and cavemen wielding assorted bones.

Time is running out; you desperately need someone who can outfox the Count before it is too late; but who?  And then, a name reaches your ears from your trusty Robot Ell. . . .

If you are Police Robot Ell, you were thrilled when you finally caught up with two elusive small-time smugglers, but before you could read them their rights, they blasted into hyperspace.  Drat!  You grip your circuits - traveling through hyperspace gives you the heebie-jeebies, but that won't stop you!  When you find them again, your are surprised: they had rescued a man from the Emperor's missing ship!  Perhaps the Emperor should hear about pilot Stella Star. . . .

If you are Stella, you and your long-time fellow smuggler Akton, knew, that if the long arm of the Imperial Police ever collared you, you were in for some hard prison time.  What you didn't know, was that the Emperor himself was about to offer you a reprieve if you and Akton would accept a most dangerous mission; as it turns out, you are the Emperor's only hope. . . .

Overall: there is no pretense that this is hard science fiction; it is pure fantasy, which is fine.  In spite of the numerous visual, dialog, and script inconsistencies, it is a fun romp.

The video quality on the blu-ray is stunning, the sharpness,color saturation, and musical score remastering are unbelievable! Particularly when you consider the  original editing job. Among the thorough entertaining extras, Carolyn Monroe  dishes on her career, and the many scenes they shot . And we get to see these scenes that never made the choppy final edit. Is it the over editing that delivers this fun romp into contention with Planet Nine from Outer Space for best worst sci fi ever? Is this storyboard hodgepodge in dire need of a new directors cut?  It's like a glitzy comic book with half the pages missing. Oh well, it certainly  doesnt seem to bother Marjo, Stella or any of the stellar cast.

The special effects are not so special and the space ships look like they were made out of Legos.  Many of the scenes in this film are pale imitations of some of the classic scenes from ""Star Wars"".  The actors are hilarious in an overblown and hammy manner.  They speak the most ridiculous dialogue while keeping a solemn face as if what they did not just was was utterly ridiculous.  David Hasselhoff has a role in this film.  Enough said!  Caroline Munro plays the female lead but while she certainly looks better than Carrie Fisher, she lacks her charm and acting ability.  She does look good in a space bikini that she wears through most of the film.  I don't know if this film was ever featured on ""MST3K"" but it would be perfect for a roasting on that show.

The picture is bright and colorful, well defined edges as you would expect from a Blu Ray title. Not to compare with movies just released of course but well worth the Blu Ray brand. I for one did not expect it to look this good.

 Caroline Munro,..It is so nice to see this lovely lady in all of her cinematic beauty. Lets face it, it's because of Caroline Munro this movie found it's place in cinematic history.

 Also included is an hour long chat with this gorgeous woman and her start in the business. Included in her interview are most of the movies she also appeared in and what she thought about each role she played. Also how the dialogue was changed in ""Star Crash"" at the last minute to include dubbed versions of most of the actors instead of the original that was recorded in each take. Something she was never aware of until the screening.

 All in all I am very happy with this release and am very proud to have it in my DVD collection. Hats off to SHOUT for this wonderful treat.

4159794,4,B003NHMYHY,"Ridiculous, laughable, shockingly bad, and yet, oddly compelling - it's shiny and twinkles, it's like Christmas in widescreen!  Vibrant and violent, a spacey and spaced out cartoon, the pacing is wild and mercifully quick.  The 92 minutes just race along.  So it can hardly be considered torture.
The spacecraft are clearly models plucked straight from a box; obviously, they spared no expense (although one has to wonder which side of a buck the budget was on).  The dialog barely wastes a word in its own defense, the acting is nominal...Marjoe Gortner got top billing, his name above the title, for pity sake!  Thank goodness a real thespian (Christopher Plummer) popped in to lend the piece an air of credibility...well, okay, not so much.  But at least he was well paid for what little he did!
Eyeliner all around (rock stars in space?), why didn't this one win an Oscar for best make-up?  (Because half the time they misapplied the green on Robert Tessier's puss.)  As for the shape of the head on the robot Elle....on purpose or sheer accident?  And why did he sound like something out of a bad western?  This movie owed a lot more to the old Flash Gordon serial than Star Wars.  That it plucked scenes and elements from a lot of Sci-fi flicks, like gathering nuts in May, is too obvious to ignore but so what?  It's not really plagiarism if you screw it up.  Not a movie you'd want to take to court and compare scene for scene.
Joe Spinell as the arch villain...why do villains always cackle?  David Hasselhoff before he got all wet.  Caroline Munro more than likely asked if that one plastic bag outfit made her look fat...oh, yes.  Marjoe Gortner, all teeth and nose, put up a good fight but you can't make an actor out of a sow's ear.
Still, for sheer audacity, there's something indefinable that makes this film watchable, a collector's item, something to trot out and enjoy when you're feeling blue.  How bad can life be if there's something like this that's so honestly worse?
It's a keeper!",1306886400,3,2005,4.650568181818182
4159795,3,B003NHMYHY,"In 1977, Star Wars was a critical and commercial hit! It made movies fun again! In the 1970's, sci-fi movies were dark, violent, downbeat, low budget, and nightmarish! Filmmakers were trying to maximize any sci-fi project that they had the rights to. Luigi Cozzi's Starcrash(1979) was one of the Star Wars clones. The Emperor(Christopher Plummer) forces sexy smuggler Stella Star(Caroline Munro) to find his son. Our heroes also have to battle the megalomaniacal Zarth Arn(Joe Spinell). The film is so bad, it's good. It has a sense of fun and adventure that the overrated Battlestar Galactica remake lacked. An Amazon Queen yells, ""I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE!""  and we'll never find out what she wants revenge for. The robot police officer Elle has a ""Southern"" accent looped over him! It's like that scene in Sleeper(1973) where Jackie Mason's voice is looped over a robot sales clerk! Akton(Marjoe Gortner) claims that three space fighters are attacking their ship and only one can be seen in the VFX shots!
 British starlet Caroline Munro plays smuggler Stella Star and American English is looped over her accent. Munro played a sensual femme fatale in the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me(1977). Speaking of James Bond, the late John Barry composed the music score for Starcrash. It gives heart and soul to a film packed with 1970's cheese! A young David Hasselhoff(Knight Rider, Baywatch) plays Prince Simon. We get to see Marjoe Gortner engage in a light saber duel with two stop motion robots! In one scene, Stella Star almost freezes to death on a planet covered in snow. I wonder if George Lucas got even by having the Rebels hide on the ice planet Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back(1980)? I like the scene where a capsule smashes through a space station window and the room doesn't depressurize!

4159800,4,B003NHMYHY,"STARCRASH, despite its title, isn't really so much an Italian STAR WARS ripoff as it is The One Movie Italian SF fan Luigi Cozzi (former assistant to suspense *maestro* Dario Argento) always really truly *wanted* to make. Originally titled THE ADVENTURES OF STELLA STARR, it tells the tale of sexy intergalactic lovable lady rogue Stella Starr (Caroline Munro in the Fredrick's of Hollywood Fetish Collection, 1978) and her partner, the superhuman Akton (Marjoe Gortner in what looks like Mork from Ork's jumpsuit!) running afoul of a plot to destroy the Empire of the First Circle of the Universe by the villainous Lord Zarth Arn (career heavy Joe Spinell, relishing the opportunity to play a melodramatic villain complete with full-length cape and dramatic poses). Offered a pardon by the heroic Emperor (Christopher Plummer in a gold lame ensemble that he actually manages to make look like imperial rainment, despite the actor's clear bafflement at having gotten roped into this movie!) in exchange for tracking down the whereabouts of the starship MURRAY LEINSTER which was carrying his ""only son"", Simon, Stella and Akton, accompanied by the policemen who captured them originally, Chief of Police Thor (Robert Tessier) and Police Robot Elle (a man-in-a-suit android with a *thick* Southern accent, a quick draw with twin blaster pistols and a wide variety of ""comic"" neuroses) plunge into a series of adventures freely borrowed from Harryhausen stop-motion classics, Cold War Military thrillers, ""lost civilization"" adventures, Italian spear&sandal epics, Westerns - oh, and some requisite shout-outs to the then-new STAR WARS in the form of cheesy space dogfights and Akton's bargain-basement light saber.

The special effects and production design are far more ambitious than believable, though to be fair the entire budget for STARCRASH is probably less than what Lucas spends at Starbucks in a month. The dialogue is B-Movie squared, and the cast's performances are all over the map, from bored professionalism (Plummer) to caffeinated over-enthusiasm (Gortner, Spinell) to Delivering-Lines-At-Gunpoint incompetence (whichever actor delivered the line ""They found ONE. DAMN. SURVIVOR!"" deserves a Life Achievement Razzie for that alone), and all points in-between (I've seen this movie dozens of times, and I still can't decide if Munro is awful or brilliantly campy). Ironically, the one performer who has just the right air of tongue-in-cheek heroism is David Hasselhoff, in an early major role.

By any formal sense, STARCRASH is a stinker - but I can't help but love every clay-pigeon exploding starfighter, clunkily-written, jawdropping mis-scored (by 007 soundtrack composer John Barry setting space battles to lounge music, no less!) moment of it. Cozzi clearly loves SF and Fantasy films, and that love comes through every frame of this cut-rate space opera. Forget PLAN NINE - STARCRASH is the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made!

This two-disc set released as part of Shout! Factory's ""Roger Corman's Cult Classics"" series, offers a 16:9 anamorphic version of the slightly shorter New Horizons cut of STARCRASH, but compensates with a bunch of ""deleted/extended scenes"" from other releases (including the International Version released on letterboxed non-anamorphic DVD in France), an audio commentary by ""STARCRASH Expert Stephen Romano"", interviews with Cozzi and Munro, a documentary about the special effects, behind-the-scenes footage, and theatrical trailers with optional commentaries by Joe Dante and Eli Roth, and a 12-page booklet on the movie also by Romano. If you've ever liked how Italy's film industry does science fiction and fantasy, you will love STARCRASH - and this is the best version available, by far. For about $20 on DVD or Blu-Ray, I'd call it a must-own.",1294185600,2,3796,5.430508474576271
4159801,4,B003NHMYHY,"What's better than a Luigi Cozzi film?  I sure as hell can't think of anything.  Always fun and almost always much bigger in scope than his budget will allow, yet he doesn't seem to care and soldiers on.  If you haven't seen Hercules and The Adventures of Hercules, you're really cheating yourself out of a good time.  His ""horror"" film, Contamination is fun and worth a look as well.
Here we have his ""Star Wars ripoff"", as everyone likes to call it, though he conceived it years before Star Wars.  Of course no one wanted to do the film, but after the success of Star Wars, everyone wanted to do the film.
Basically the plot involves intergalactic, sexy buttkicking chick, Stella Star(played by the criminally sexy Caroline Munroe) going from space adventure to space adventure in pursuit of Ming The Merciless-type space baddie, Joe Spinnell.  Along with her are her comic relief robot sidekick, and her navigator, Marjoe Gortner.  Lots of stop motion FX, ridiculous dialogue, miniatures, flashing lights, beeps and boinks, and of course a small early role from David Hasselhoff, as a prettyboy prince turned space fighter and love interest.  Oh, lets not forget the great Christopher Plummer was somehow lured into this film as the Emperor Of The First Circle Of Space(or some nonsense to that effect).
For me, probably the most interesting character is Marjoe Gortner's.  He's kinda odd.  First, he seems to have no romantic interest whatsoever in Stella, which I would find very difficult to believe.  I mean, c'mon, she's in S&M attire through half the film and he never even gives her the elevator eyes!  Second, Gortner seems to possess powers and knowledge that's never quite explained.  He's the best fighter, and knows what's going on all the time-at one point we find out that he can see into the future, but this is only mentioned once and never brought up again-yet he always stays aboard and sends Stella out to explore when they land on a mysterious planet.  Nice guy.  He's also got the whole Yoda mentor vibe going on and gets to say lines like, ""Have faith....and never give up hope"".  He also can create electric doodles from his hands and deflect enemy lasers off his chest.
Roger Corman's New World Pictures bought and distributed this film in the U.S.  So far I believe this is the only DVD from the Shout! Factory Collection that Corman wasn't directly involved with the production of the film.  This version is the New World version, so there are some minor cuts to the film, but those scenes can be viewed on Disc 2.  Lots of Bonus stuff here, more than you'd expect for this film.  There's an interview with Cozzi as well as a fairly lengthy interview with Munroe(still very pretty).

4159805,4,B003NHMYHY,"I was a teenage sci-fi geek when I first stumbled across ""Star Crash"" on Sunday afternoon TV (circa 1984). I had never heard of the film but at the time I was interested in seeing anything space-based. As soon as the opening scenes rolled by, it quickly became obvious that I should not expect a classic, but as the film continued I had a blast laughing at the nonsensical dialogue, hammy over-the-top acting, cheap special effects, candy-colored set designs, and blatant 'steals' from other films. It was mostly terrible, but I loved it. ""Star Crash"" was a deliriously cool ""B"" movie that made quite an impression on me.

Time went by and though I never saw ""Star Crash"" again on TV or in the video store, the film haunted my dreams for nearly 25 years. Let's face it, it'd be pretty hard for any red blooded American boy to forget the gorgeous Stella Starr and her leather space bikini, not to mention the seemingly endless (cheesy) space battles, a white guy with an Afro battling badly animated stop motion robots, and a young David Hasselhoff! Thus, when Shout Factory announced a deluxe 2-DVD (!) edition of ""Star Crash"" was in the works as part of their awesome ""Roger Corman Cult Classics"" series, I had to plunk down my $$ for a copy. I watched the film a few nights ago with a big stupid smile on my face the entire time. Yes, ""Star Crash"" is crap ... but it's such AWESOME crap that you can't help but love every minute of this Italian-made mish-mash. Director Luigi Cozzi (a protg of horror meister Dario Argento) is apparently a lifelong sci-fi fan who had always wanted a chance to do a film in that style. When ""Star Wars"" became a monster hit in 1977, the Italian B-movie industry naturally wanted to get in on the action and so they called Cozzi. Like any good fanboy would do if given his dream opportunity, Cozzi went absolutely nuts, gleefully borrowing bits not only from ""Star Wars,"" but also ""Barbarella,"" ""Jason and the Argonauts,"" and the old ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Buck Rogers"" serials (to name just a few), putting'em all in a blender on the ""liquify"" setting, and coming out with a flick that ended up being way more than just a simple ""Star Wars"" cash-in. ""Star Crash"" is not only a truly bizarre movie in its own right, but it's also Cozzi's love letter to an entire film genre.

The story: Sexy space pirate Stella Starr (former Bond Girl Caroline Munro, who looks astoundingly hot in the aforementioned leather bikini and go-go boots) and her co-pilot Akton (wooden '70s character actor Marjoe Gortner) are arrested by the Space Police for various crimes against the Galaxy, but the Emperor of the Universe (Christopher Plummer, dropping in to earn a quick mortgage payment) offers them a reprieve if they go on a quest to find the ""secret planet"" of the evil Zarth Arn (an utterly miscast Joe Spinell of ""Maniac"" fame; imagine Ming the Merciless if he were being played by Freddie Mercury). Zarth (ha!) is threatening the universe with a super powerful weapon that must be destroyed. The Emperor's son disappeared while trying to find it, so hey, if Stella and Akton could pick him up while they're at it, well, that'd be swell too.

Thus, Akton and Stella head off on a series of interstellar adventures with their annoying Police Robot sidekick ""El,"" who for some reason is programmed to talk like a Western cowboy, which gets old really quick. As she travels from planet to planet, Stella runs afoul of a gang of hot Space Amazons and their giant, sword-throwing robot with boobs, barely survives being frozen on an arctic planet, and finally hooks up with the prince (David Hasselhoff in his first major film role) on a world of savage cavemen. It just so happens that Prince Hoff crash landed on the same planet that houses Zarth's secret weapon, so they call in reinforcements for the Space Battle to End All Space Battles, with hundreds of plastic model-kit ships zipping past multi-colored starfield backgrounds, exploding left and right, while the Emperor's forces fight it out with Zarth's army aboard his fist-shaped base ship. (Try not to crack a smile as Spinell stalks back and forth across the bridge of his ship, barking ""KILL! KILL!"" at the top of his lungs as his soldiers race around having laser gun battles with the good guys. Seriously. Just try.) Do the good guys win? Does it matter? ""Star Crash"" moves along at such a breathless pace that you barely have time to think about how silly the whole thing is until it's over. The cast seems to be having a blast, and though director Cozzi obviously didn't have a huge budget to work with on this flick, he squeezed the maximum out of every dollar (or perhaps that should be ""every Lira""). The movie is absolutely packed with eye candy (and I'm not just talking about Caroline Munro, though the fact that she IS in nearly every scene helps a lot) and has a unique, ridiculous look that's all its own.

Shout Factory's DVD is stuffed with a multitude of bonus features including interviews with Munro and Cozzi, two (!) commentary tracks by obsessed ""Star Crash"" scholar Stephen Romano, documentaries on the special effects and music, an art gallery, and probably a few dozen other things that I haven't even found yet. The Roger Corman Cult Classics DVDs has been a killer series thus far and ""Star Crash"" is no exception. These are people who truly love their ""B"" movies! Seriously folks, if you buy just one Italian-made low budget ""Star Wars"" ripoff this year, make sure it's this one. ""Star Crash"" is now ready to be re-discovered by a whole new generation of film junkies. If you haven't seen it before, now is your chance. Go for Hyperspace!",1290297600,2,5646,4.677062374245473

Distributor: Shout Factory, US

What is the most cheesy flick you remember from your childhood?

If you were a fan of Italian sci-fi rip off movies during the late 70's or early 80's then the answer to the above question could well be Starcrash. Once Star Wars hit theatres in the late 1970's, it was such box office gold worldwide, that in Italy science fiction movies were perceived as the next big thing. Starcrash was their answer to the George Lucas smash hit, and like its predecessor, over the years the film has since gained a wide cult following and probably not without good reason. Admittedly the acting in Starcrash will never be considered as Oscar worthy and a couple of the effects now look as though they were put together by Blue Peter presenters using sticky-backed plastic, however beneath the cheese factor, there is actually a worthwhile story here. The movie packs into its running time, many different aspects including: space adventure, Amazon tribes (on horseback), a giant warrior Titan, frozen planets, stone age tribes, light sabre battles, a pair of mean looking sword wielding Gollums, a wise cracking robot and a wannabe Jedi as loyal companions, outer space battles and even David Hasslehoff sporting extreme eye liner, that it is at the very least, entertaining for some, and an outright classic for many.

Starcrash is released on Blu-ray as part of Shout Factories Roger Corman's Cult Classics series with the disc labelled as region A, but thankfully not being actually locked.  The film has a troubled history with print quality on previous releases, but the new 1080p anamorphic wide-screen transfer on this Blu-ray, is easily the best that the film has ever looked. The transfer however is not without some small issues. Some minor print damage is evident during a small number of scenes and although colours and black levels are generally good, there are some instances where the picture looks a little faded at times. That being said, this is probably due to the original low budget filming elements rather than any mastering issues and there are no real problems of any major concern with this transfer. Comparing this Blu-ray release to the horrible previous DVD transfers is like comparing night and day. Starcrash really never has looked this good before. It is worth noting however, that this release contains the shorter American edit of the film. Certain scene extensions which were present in the original UK and European releases have been trimmed from the US cut, as the film was considered to run smoother this way for American audiences. These trims are nothing of any notable concern and they are all present in the deleted scenes section on disc 2 along with other extra features.

Audio quality on this release is again a vast improvement on the DVD releases, and the now classic music score thunders through the speakers in DTS HD audio, sounding more powerful than ever before. Dialogue and effects are clear, although nothing spectacular, but again bearing in mind the films original low budget roots, it would be wrong to expect knock out sound quality to rival the new movie releases.

Extras are plentiful on this release. On the first disc, there is a very informative extended interview with the films director Luigi Cozzi, which should really be considered as more of a mini making of documentary. Two audio commentaries can also be found here which feature Starcrash expert Stephen Romano and between them cover just about any aspect of the film that you would care to research. Other extras on this disc include a detailed analysis of the films music score, behind the scenes gallery, promotional art and fan art galleries, TV and radio spots and original trailers which also have commentary options with Eli Roth and Joe Dante. On the second disc there is an extended interview with Caroline Munroe who discusses her time as Stella Star and her subsequent career, 17 deleted scenes, original screenplay, a behind the scenes reel complete with commentary track and a feature which looks at the special effects of the film. As if all that wasn't enough, there is even a 10 page booklet containing Stephen Romano's general thoughts on the film and a reversible cover.
Starcrash has certainly been given the royal treatment on Blu-ray. Not only does the picture and sound quality alone justify the purchase, but the extras here really are something special for fans of the film. If you have a fondness for campy science fiction movies, or even for seeing Caroline Munroe in a variety of skimpy outfits, then re-visit this classic trashy piece of Italian cinema, like you have never seen or heard it before.

4159807,4,B003NHMYHY,"I missed ""Starcrash"" when it first came to cinemas and I was glad at last to see it on DVD in this exceptional two-disc edition under the banner of ""Roger Corman's Cult Classics"" (even though it was a film distributed rather than produced by Corman's fabled New World Pictures). While the European look of the film invites comparison to superior films like ""Barbarella"" and ""Danger: Diabolik"", ""Starcrash"" remains thoroughly entertaining action adventure. It's cult reputation is deserved. Much easier to follow than the messy ""Star Wars"" pictures which collapse under the weight of overblown special effects. For the movie serial still have the magic for me and ""Starcrash"" has some of this magic. No red-blooded male can possibly take his eyes of Caroline Munro. I have already watched it about five times in the past couple of weeks. The extra features on the two discs are a fan's dreams. The audiocommentaries are interesting and, importantly, entertaining. Lots of action, lots of fun, great dialogue, likeable characters (even the villains).",1288656000,2,1048,5.207100591715976
4159808,5,B003NHMYHY,"After seeing several dire versions of this film,both on VHS and DVD I thought the idea of seeing this campy classic fully restored and packed with extras would never happen....

4159810,5,B003NHMYHY,"I am so happy to see a quality print of this film, this is the only you should buy. Filled with lots of trivia and extras on this copy, it is meant as pure fun. Do not take it too seriously.

Caroline Munro in boots, need I saw more?",1286668800,2,233,3.7551020408163267
4159811,5,B003NHMYHY,"Who would think that seeing StarCrash beautifully restored and in 1080p would totally change my opinion of this obscure gem?

You see my first run-in with this film was via the French DVD release from a few years back. I can safely say that I was not impressed. Sourced from what looked like an actual exhibition print, colors were muddy and dull. Sound on the English track was even worse. Added to this I went in expect what most online reviews have incorrectly called a Star Wars rip-off.

Oh, how things have changed! I now absolutely love this film! In order to understand and appreciate StarCrash you have to know it's background. Director Luigi Cozzi is like a kid in a candy shop. Every genre he grew up loving and admiring in Italy has been stuffed into StarCrash! From Harryhausen, Barbarella, cliffhanger serials, and beyond. It may be set in space, but Star Wars it ain't (thankfully).

StarCrash is a romp. Cheesy, yes! Fun as hell! Mesmerizing and absolutely engrossing! It's not high art and it was never meant to be. Everything that should be wrong (scripting, production values, special effects, some of the acting) is somehow right for this film. Plus it's all wrapped up in John Barry's glorious score.

Shout Factory has done wonders with this release. Rescuing Roger Corman's decaying elements and producing an eye-popping transfer. The film has probably never looked this good. I know some were complaining about the bit rate on this, but it only dips down low in scenes with optical effects.

Enlisting Stephen Romano to produce bonus content was a no brainer. The man absolutely is nuts about this film, and thank God for that! I'm sure Shout regretted getting him involved when the bills came in! It is the most packed of the Roger Corman releases so far and there isn't a duff feature included. The interview with Luigi Cozzi is very enlightening. He explains his early years and the genesis of the film, the writing process, casting, and production. We also get the true story of Star Riders, the StarCrash sequel that never was - in more ways than one!

Caroline Munro is on hand to give a lengthy interview about her career and her time as Stella Star! Now this feature has been criticized by some and the points raised are certainly valid. However, I would rather have it than not have it! I appreciate that Shout went through the trouble of getting Caroline involved. The final product may not be as technically polished as the others on the disc, but I'm glad it's here.

The star of the release though is Stephen Romano. His two audio commentaries will tell you everything you need to know about the film (including who dubbed Caroline's voice!). There is no overlap between the two and it feels like one is listening to a film school professor preparing you for a final exam! I honestly feel that once you understand the background of why StarCrash came to be, and the actual production of the film, you will walk away with a better appreciation of it.

Now add to this, deleted scenes, trailers with commentary by Joe Dante and Eli Roth, a fun feature on special effects by Armando Valcauda, rare photos, and a music feature. Shout has totally spoiled us! I am eternally grateful for everyone involved in making this such a special release. My love of StarCrash is now never ending. I am officially a Crasher for life!",1286582400,3,3353,4.709897610921502
4159812,1,B003NHMYHY,"OK, I admit it, I bought this because I love Sci/Fi flix and the thought of watching Caroline Munro run around in a leatherette bikini just sounded too good. I knew I saw this way back when... but couldn't remember it at all so I grabbed it. What a terrible flic. Terrible terrible acting, and the special F/X look like they were done in the garage. Caroline Munro's butt was way to big for that bikini too...",1286064000,2,409,4.324675324675325
4159813,1,B003NHMYHY,"Is it so bad it's good, or is it just plain bad?

On the one hand, I realize that many people who know a lot more than I do about science fiction films, and about movies in general, consider ""Starcrash"" an important camp classic, along the lines of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbarella/dp/B00005421R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbarella</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show/dp/B00006D295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>."" Judging from some of the comments here on Amazon and elsewhere, some of these experts looked forward to this DVD release more eagerly than perhaps any other film in recent memory. I also looked forward to it, even though I was not familiar with the film, because it did get several good reviews, and I always enjoy taking a chance and ""discovering"" new movies that I've not seen before. I WANTED to like it.

But, on the other hand, let's face it--""Starcrash"" is bad. Painfully, excruciatingly bad. Here's what it offers: 1) a disjointed, incoherent plot, 2) truly terrible, somnambulistic acting, 3) amateurish, laughable special effects, 4) inane, senseless dialogue, 5) extremely poor production values and 6) bizarre, slipshod editing. There are virtually NO reasons to recommend it. The ONLY thing it has going for it is the lovely Caroline Munro in the role of spaceship pilot Stella Star. I'm saddened to report, however, that even the delectable Ms. Munro in her outer-space bikini can't salvage this stinker. Don't waste your money or time on it unless you're a die-hard fan of really bad movies. You've been warned...",1285718400,8,1696,5.807228915662651
4159814,5,B003NHMYHY,"If a newly remastered picture and 5.1 surround sound aren't enough reasons to make you purchase the ""Starcrash"" Collector's Edition DVD then maybe the scantly clad Caroline Munro will!

Prepare for Hyperspace! A pair of Galactic bandits, Stella and Akton her alien sidekick come across a badly damaged ship and its lone survivor while trying to outrun the galactic authorities. Unknown to the two of them, the lone survivor was sent by the Emperor on secret mission to destroy a mysterious super-weapon designed by the evil Count Zarth Arn. Stella and Akton are soon captured by the intergalactic robot lawman Elle and sentenced to prison for their space crimes. After escaping from prison Stella learns that along with Akton she has been recruited by the Emperor to complete the mission to destroy Count Zarth Arn's super-weapon as well as rescue the Emperor's only son Simon who has vanished somewhere in space. Can Stella Star save the universe from annihilation? You'll have to buy your own copy to find out.

Fans of ""Starcrash"" aka ""The Adventures of Stella Star"" will be blown away with what they see and hear in this new two disc collector's edition from Shout! The brand new 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer is truly amazing and a real treat for any fan of this movie. Shout factory definitely spent some money on the video and sound remastering because I've never seen this film look so good. The picture is crystal clear and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The new 5.1 Digital Surround Sound has breathed new life into this old Drive-In classic and I'm happy to finally own it on DVD. The disc packaging and disc artwork is well done, even the slip cover is reversible.

Released from Shout! Factory under the ""Roger Corman Cult Classics"" collection this is not Luigi Cozzi's Italian Director's Cut version of ""Starcrash"" This is the American theatrical version and the one shown in theatres back in 1979, it's roughly 5 minutes shorter than the Italian version. This ultimate two disc version is filled with tons of special features and hours of bonus material along with interviews, still photos, behind the scenes footage as well as deleted footage from Cozzi's Director's Cut. If you want a fantastic picture and awesome sound than this is the only version to own.

4159815,5,B003NHMYHY,"YES, Starcrash is cheesy. This is lovingly splashed all over the DVD cover. If you didn't get that it's gratuitously wacky--or if you hate fun--then don't read any further.

Okay, still here? Good, because Starcrash has a lot to offer in the way of entertainment. I'd like to think of this film as a cousin to some of the Ray Harryhausen films that pack in a ton of special effects into a Saturday Matinee-styled film.

I'd even go so far as to say the story is disjointed, but hilariously so. And while campy, it takes itself seriously (for the most part) in a way that gives it an endearing quality. If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, you're going to LOVE this movie.

This movie just looks like it was a blast to make for the cast and filmmakers, and that's easily apparent. The DVD extras on disk two (non-Blu Ray edition) include interviews with cast and crew that confirm as much--as well as the fact that they were ""in on the joke"".

Starcrash has more in common with the 1980 Flash Gordon, Barbarella, or even Spaghetti Westerns from the 70s, than Star Wars. If that's what you're expecting, look elsewhere.

But if you want to laugh and cheer on the good guys, then you can't do much better than Starcrash!",1284595200,8,1229,4.493273542600897
4159816,2,B003NHMYHY,"Here's the lowdown on this release (as I have an advanced copy, and not a screener, but the actual DVD), the movie included is the truncated Roger Corman (let's take out all of the good one liners for time reasons and to make this campy bit of inspired cheese, less cheesy, which face it, is the one reason to watch it, for it's cheese factor) version, which sucks space donkey testicles,  as Corman's version manages to suck a lot of the fun out of this movie.

Here's the rub though, Shout! Factory has a nice gallery of the stuff that Corman cut out, courtesy of some lower grade Euro print, but the whole Euro version should have been included as a directors cut like they did with, Forbidden World, where the second disc held the director's cut, and as this set has two discs as well, they could easily have included the uncut version.

I have the, Substance version that came out years ago, and it's got all of the missing line included, but the major problem with that release is about 10 insanely loud pop sounds on the audio track that occur at odd intervals through out the movie (which tend to strike when you're least expecting them, thus startling the bejesus out of you) so it would have been nice if the international cut had been included here (minus the loud sound glitches) because as it stands, the Corman version takes a lot of the fun out of this film, which is too bad.

So if you have the, Substance version, you're gonna want to hold onto it (sound glitches and all) because that's the better cut of this film, even if the quality on the Corman version is better (and to think, I almost sold my, Substance version, having no idea that the, Shout! Factory version was going to be the far inferior Corman cut, dodged a bullet there :)

***UPDATE: In a letter I received from, Shout Factory concerning the non-inclusion of the long sought after Director's Cut on their recent release of, StarCrash, they said that (and I quote): ""Yours is the first complaint we have received. If there were a lot of complaints, we'd look to see about maybe doing another version at some point"", so apparently if they get enough complaints concerning this problem, then they will eventually do what they should have done in the first instance (and failed to do so).

So goto the, Shout Factory site and inundate them with emails requesting that the director's cut be included in a new version of this DVD (I had the email link here, but for some inane reason on Amazon's part, they bleeped it out (!!!)",1283904000,11,2506,4.508810572687224
4159817,5,B003NHMYHY,"Luigi Cozzi's Star Crash (a/k/a The Adventures of Stella Star) is one of my all-time favorite movies. Usually dismissed as a cheap Italian Star Wars knock-off, it's actually much, much more than that: it's a cheap Italian knock-off of all three Flash Gordon serials, Barbarella, hundreds of pulp space operas and comic books, and a half-dozen Ray Harryhausen movies.

It literally has everything: a scantily clad heroine, a comic relief robot, stop-motion monsters, lightsabre duels, space amazons, space troglodytes, a galactic villain with a beer belly, ray guns, ludicrous spaceship miniatures, beach ball planets, blinking Christmas tree light stars, an eclectic international cast that includes Joe Spinell, David Hasselhoff, Marjoe Gortner, Robert Tessier, and an apparently stoned-out-of-his-mind Christopher Plummer... and a marvelous musical score by Academy Award-winning composer John Barry!

I've long lamented that there wasn't a quality, authorized DVD edition of this personal favorite available, and the thought that in a few days I'll have a high-definition, widescreen copy on Blu-Ray is exciting. Ever since I read director Cozzi's article about the origins of and the making of the film in Future magazine (anyone remember that companion mag to Starlog, later known as Future Life?) back in '77, I've been fascinated with the film, and when I finally saw it on VHS with some friends around 1990, I couldn't believe just how much giddy, shameless, stupid fun it was.

There isn't much I don't love about the movie, to be honest. Caroline Munro is gorgeous, the special effects are psychedelic, the characters so ridiculous and earnest... it's pure, rainy Saturday afternoon bliss, and vastly more entertaining than ANY of the Star Wars prequels or the mind-numbingly boring and overrated Avatar.",1283904000,115,1814,5.448398576512456

The main story is that Stella Star, Akton and Elle, under the orders of the Emperor, set off to find Count Zarth Arn secret weapon on a hidden planet and to find the Emperor only son. That is the movie in a nutshell. The main thing this movie has going for it are two things. First the artwork and remember no computer graphic imaging in the Seventies so a lot of this was painted. A lot of the space scenes were paint and some background as well. Also the stop-motion model animation is not bad also. Second the music of John Barry which was scored in just four days is good. In the United States version the original film was trimmed by five minutes to keep in going. This film marks Europe first foray into the science fiction movie franchise. Starcrash gets an A.

8401181,5,B003NHMYHY,"Just  finished watching ""Star Crash"" released by The Shout Factory.
With a variety of science fiction, fantasy, and super hero movies coming out every month, it's may be hard to believe for some Millennials that during the 1970s, it was extremely rare for a science fiction movie to grace the Silver Screen after the Golden Age of Sci-Fi Movies during the 1950s and 1960s.  Then George Lucas wrote, produced, and directed ""Star Wars"" and sci-fi movies quickly became all the rage - especially for studios looking in to get in on some of the lucrative Sci-Fi action; i.e., cash that ""Star Wars"" was raking in.
So it was only natural that classic cult film maker Roger Corman would want to cash in on the latest craze in movie making and make his own - as cheaply as possible of course since that is part of what Corman is  known for.
So from a a vast and distant galaxy, Corman gave us ""a space adventure for all time"" starring the lovely Caroline Munro - as the space bikini smuggler Stella Star - who, along with her alien partner Akton; are recruited by the Emperor to search among ""The Haunted Stars"" to find out what happened to the star cruiser ""Murray Leinster"" - which was commanded by the Emperor's only son who was on a mission to seek out the evil count who is trying to overthrow the Emperor.  There is even a robot policeman to help Stella and Akton on their quest to learn the fate of the Emperor's son and rescue him if possible.
Now as science fiction fans know, Murray Leinster was a popular science fiction writer who wrote the popular novella ""First Contact"" and the MED Series;  and it was his fellow science fiction writer Edmond Hamilton who wrote ""The Haunted Stars.""
Do not watch this movie expecting great special effects and logic - remember this is a Roger Corman movie.
""Star Crash"" is simply a great sci-fi spoof - where else can you see bikini wearing Space Amazons? [No Zack Newsome, the lovely Space Empress Katie Wy; i.e., your wife, would not approve of you watching this movie - sorry.  Yes, Michael Newsome, you may borrow this movie if you would like.]
On a side note, my good friend Steve Orchard, got me an the lovely and gracious Caroline Munro's autograph on ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,"" which is framed in a shadowbox in my office.  {Thatnks Again Steve!  :)]
Great Innocent Fun!
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1491696000,,2354,4.588095238095238
