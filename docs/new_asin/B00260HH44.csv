3850467,2,B00260HH44,"Ordered this on the premise of Mila Kunis possibly carrying a film, and they were advertising this as the ""unrated"" version. But in the end, you are left with feeling disappointment and watching bad storytelling.

Mila plays a troubled young lady who is sent to an island work camp by her parents. The isolated layout of this camp in Fiji could make for a beautiful filming location, but it really only gets used once or twice (coral, white sand beaches, etc.). Peter Stormare (I always remember him the most as Satan in Constantine) fills the role as the camp creator and leader of this paramilitary counseling group. The idiot boyfriend who finds a way to get himself committed to the same camp (yeah right) is played by Gregory Smith (he has a much better role in Closing the Ring).

As more unlikely events occur and an intermittent writing mess unfolds in virtually every scene, the movie strives to falter. Mila tried very hard here, and I have to give her props for taking a somewhat different role. There are plenty of important themes attempted here, including the topics of physical abuses and illegal activities that occur at these camps, but the short paragraph statement in the credits is all we are given as an extra. No supplements. The sound was average as was the picture quality. Regarding the unrated quip, everything that could give it an R happens off camera or is edited out (Mila's shower scenes and abuses towards one female character). Almost feels like a made for TV movie, but even then so much is not explained or elaborated on, that it misses the mark on being an informative film. It becomes more of a brief passion piece film about these camps.",1251244800,32,1675,4.6938775510204085

3850476,3,B00260HH44,"The plot is that some teenagers are so out of control that their parents send them on a horrible holiday to a `tough love' camp - this one is in Fiji. Once they get to the island they are treated fairly shabbily, but the idea is that if you toe the line then you get to go home. That is back to the twisted parents who sent you there in the first place.

In the film we have Sophie - Mila Kunis - who is a rather annoying teen with a step father who has had enough. Her boyfriend - Ben, Gregory Smith (`Hobo with a shotgun') - is gutted and decides to get her back. Then the shenanigans in the sand begin.

Now the whole point of this film is to raise awareness about Boot Camp type places which did look like an extreme 12 step programme where the carrot and stick method are taken to extremis. The problem is that it is simply not a well executed film. The underlying themes of parental abuse of power, or the corruption of the camp organisers is just left there but not explored. Also using the inmates to police each other with varying degrees of success was not a new idea but again not expanded. The real theme should have been that justice administered without responsibility is tyranny - and that too is left virtually untouched.

That said most of the acting is good - Peter Stormare is fair to middling as the guru behind the Serenity project, but he is almost a cardboard cut out baddy with no ambiguity that shows too readily as the misguided man on a mission. The soundtrack is quite good though with the likes of `Band of Horses' and `The Cold War Kids' to name but two. Still if you want a reasonable watch with some mildly horrible things being done to troubled teens - then this could fit the bill.",1422748800,,1715,4.254601226993865

3850484,3,B00260HH44,"Boot Camp, 2008 film

What can parents do with a teenager who does wrong and is disobedient? They are not criminals (yet). They can ship their child off to ""Boot Camp"", a private reformatory school that uses psychological conditioning to change their anti-social behavior (drug use?) so they conform to society (as defined by those in authority). [It may be that they are hanging out with the wrong crowd or watching the wrong shows on TV so merely changing this environment is the cure.] The location is an island in the Pacific, the sea and the sharks keep them on the island. Peer pressure is used to control them. [No mention of the costs associated with this, but this is a movie.]

Does their misbehavior result from some undiagnosed and untreated medical condition? Letter writing is used to get them to probe their thinking. A boy and a girl plan to escape, if they can retrieve their passports. [No mention of money?] What will happen if they fail? Are people happy if they can see pain in others? [Watch some shows on TV.] Will Sophie be used as a hostage for good behavior? An escape attempt can have serious consequences for the escapee. There will be an investigation by the authorities now. Logan must answer to his students. Who decided on their treatment? Students use torches to light up their environment! Will this shut down the school?

Does this type of schooling really work in the long run? I think those children should have been given a thorough medical checkup before being sent away. Does your state allow this to happen? Maybe a working farm or ranch would be a better alternative. ""Idle hands are the devil's workshop""?",1405900800,,1648,4.715277777777778

3850491,4,B00260HH44,"The 1970s saw the rise of so-called ""tough love"" camps. Places where well to do people would send their spoiled kids to learn how to behave. The camps were often in remote locations around the world and completely unregulated. Violence, torture, and even death were used as methods of intimidation and thousand of kids were scared for life. Boot Camp is based on one of these places, but is told in the current era. Sophie Bauer (Mila Kunis) is sent to this camp in Fiji, because she's spoiled and doesn't get along with her step father. She could be there for up to a year, but that doesn't sit well with her boyfriend Ben (Gregory Smith). Ben gets sent to the camp to save Sophie, but when he gets there, he has no idea just how bad it really is. I really enjoyed this film, but they didn't spend enough time on the characters and as a result, the audience really doesn't have much empathy for the kids. What we see, really isn't bad enough to warrant them being sent away to such a place. Mila Kunis is terrific, finally playing something besides a whiny love starved introvert. She's paired with Gregory Smith, who I have enjoyed watching since he was a kid. As always, he gives a terrifically intense performance, that really makes this film as good as it was. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Peter Stormare who has been tight cast as a criminal/mafia type. Honestly, it was a little strange to see Stormare playing a doctor into meditation and rehabilitation. Overall, Boot Camp is a somewhat strange movie, but it has a terrific pair leading the way. The events are shocking, but in and of itself wouldn't make for a great film, that's where Kunis and Smith come in. The combination of the unique story, shocking events, and terrific cast lead to a film that was surprisingly enjoyable.",1386806400,,1797,4.56656346749226

What's worse is that his ""leadership"" has insidiously trickled into the camp counselors and senior camp-members.  They have all learned: If you want to get off the island, you play by the rules.

Which is a problem for Sophie (Mila Kunis) - a smart yet semi-mentally imbalanced girl making her step-father's life a living hell - and her doofus boyfriend Ben (Gregory Smith).  Sophie gets sent away unwillingly.  Rushed, drugged, and whisked away only to wake up on a speeding boat, she had no influence on her fate.

While I realize this film was most likely meant to put into light the crappy treatment that people receive at boot camps like this, the film just seemed to be lacking any real depth. I'm not sure if it was just poor writing or just too many characters and craziness going on.

Between the interesting and great part there is a really tough scene that doesn't really define the movie at all, but it is a tough scene that comes out of nowhere, slaps your morality in the face and propels this movie from campy-seen-before to something mature and life defining. This for me is where the movie starts.

That said, it isn't a completely bad movie nor is it a completely good movie. What would have made this movie better was the execution (maybe do it with a flashback syle narration)and most likely using different actors. I think the cast of Twilight would have been better in this movie because those adult-playing-kids are genuises at playing somber, downtrodden, spoilt teens.
I didn't like Mila Kunis in this. Her character is drawn out too one dimensional. She is totally miscasted and out acted by even the one line characters. Stock and background characters seem to have more dimesions that the main character that Mila is playing. I think Mila was told to just be a bratty, slick, angry-youth-in-rebellion from minute one of the first shoot to the last outtake.

If anything Regine Nehy should have been the star since her character is what propels the movie towards the end-and her character develops richly and credibly in front of us.  Either that or Mila should have played that character and remain the star. Mila's character, as you will find out after watching this, is totally irrevelant in every way for the success or failure of this movie. In other words the movie would've went on as a complete movie without her character in it.

Said and done, this is an entertaining movie that will either be praised or boo'ed by everyone with no one that will want to be on the fence about it.

Even so everyone hating or liking it must agree that it is a very entertaining movie and that is only where this flick succeeds!",1268438400,,2028,4.701408450704226

Initially, I just wanted to watch a movie with Mila Kunis in it to see why she was basically the only one (except for Ashton Kutcher on a smaller scale) who has made the successful transition from That 70's Show to the movies...my guess is that TV to the big screen a very hard thing to do...considering notable past attempts and failures. Anyway, the first thing I was greeted with in Boot Camp was not only one transitional actress, but a transitional actor as well...Gregory Smith of Everwood (an exceptional and believable actor in his own right)...and a well put together movie as well. I have been aware of these ""Tough Love"" boot camps for many years now, and I am certain that what goes on in Boot Camp is what goes on in some of them to a degree but not ALL of them. I'm sure that many of these camps, although rigid in their ways, are also successful in what they are trying to get across to troubled teens.

Anyway, back to the movie itself. This is a chilling, edge-of-your seat tale that just never lets up, and it was well-acted on ALL accounts. I had the thought on two separate occasions during the movie that I didn't want it to end. I loved some of the characters, and I hated others. The movies sucks you in and doesn't let up. Well-written, well-directed, well-produced, and filmed with a gorgeous backdrop...Boot Camp delivers from start to finish. KUDOS to all involved!

So don't read all of the bad reviews this movie shouldnt be missed but i know that it's not well known because i just knew about it when i watched it on tv.,1428969600,,439,3.8351648351648353
