5370792,4,B009X919YU,"Let me just say that I didn't really get into this show when the first season was released. Mainly because Urkle didn't show up until mid though the 1st season (he showed up the most starting on disc 3). Then season 2 was released about a year and 8 months later. I really started loving it from start to finish with season 2. It has been 8 months since the release of season 2. Warner, please don't give up on this one. Start feeling the Urkle circle again and come on out with the 3rd season. We are counting on you!",1350950400,6,518,4.138613861386139

I hate how it takes forever for the good wholesome family shows to be released and all stupid shows get released quickly.  I don't know why they take forever to release them.  It is not like they lose any money.  People will buy it because we are now the consumers, those who watched the show growing up.  Come on release it already!!",1349568000,25,393,4.47887323943662

5370799,1,B009X919YU,"Family Matters is my all-time favorite show, and this is the 3rd season of the show that I have on the DVD set. I also have the first two seasons, and the seasons from 4-8 of Family Matters on the DVD sets. There is also a 9th season of Family Matters, which is the very last season, but I don't like that season for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or watch the 9th season of Family Matters. Seasons 1-8 of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway. Other than that, this 3rd season of Family Matters is a good season to watch with good episodes, and with good memories of the Winslow family. And I do like Jaleel White as the main character of the whole show playing (Steve Urkel), which was a character that was played by him throughout all the nine seasons of the show, including this 3rd season.

One of my favorite episodes from this 3rd season is ""Making The Team"", an episode where Steve Urkel plays on the basketball team and wins, and Laura wants to be a cheerleader and ends up becoming one at the game.

It's also noticeable that this show Family Matters came out with seven Christmas episodes, and the 2nd season has the first Christmas episode. But this 3rd season of Family Matters did not come out with a Christmas episode, and neither did the first season. And I like to see the Christmas episodes, because they bring back good memories of the whole family celebrating Christmas on the show. The 2nd season and the seasons from 4-9 of Family Matters came out with Christmas episodes all together, and the 4th season has the 2nd Christmas episode. And again I do Iike the Christmas episodes of Family Matters, but the Christmas episode from the 9th season is what I would do without watching. Because like I said, I don't like the 9th season, and I wouldn't buy or watch it for a simple reason. And it's really not a big deal if there's no Christmas episode from this 3rd season, because this 3rd season of Family Matters is still a good season to watch with good episodes.

Again let me just say that all the regular episodes from this 3rd eseason of Family Matters also brings back good memories of the Winslow family, and with Jaleel White playing (Steve Urkel). The 2nd season was when Jaleel White became one of the main characters. And in this 3rd season and in the seasons from 4-9 of Family Matters, he continues to be funny and famous playing (Steve Urkel), so this is a good show with him that he's even best known for. And not only do I like Jaleel White on the show, but I also like all the other main characters. This show Family Matters is also one of the best shows I've ever seen, and I would watch it over again to enjoy with good memories, but only from seasons 1-8, including this 3rd season. It's even a show that puts me in a happy zone buy watching and enjoying it, and it's a show that I would never want to forget.

Another one of my favorite episodes from this 3rd season is ""Love and Kisses"", an episode where Laura meets singer Johnny Gill inside her house and where Johnny Gill sings to her, by Steve Urkel getting Laura to meet him, and an episode where Carl and Harriette goes on their 2nd honeymoon vacation and they stay in a room with three walls during a snowy weather. And I do like the scene from that episode with Johnny Gill singing inside the Winslow house with Steve and Laura, but my favorite scene from that episode is the one where Carl and Harriette are on their 2nd honeymoon vacation. And as a married couple on the show, I find Reginald Veljohnson as (Carl) and Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) really enjoyed their 2nd honeymoon vacation together, even though it was in a snowy weather with snowflakes falling outside by the room. That episode from this 3rd season sure does bring back good memories, and it's an episode I would never want to forget.",1490572800,,3825,4.405940594059406

I couldn't wait for 8:00pm to hit, This show was the first of several family oriented programs that would come on from 8:00pm-10:00pm.  I have purchased the first 4 seasons because I wanted to share this with my two children. They also have fallen in love with The Winslow Family. I wish television was more like this. I also purchased this series because I want my children to have something good and clean to enjoy. Each episode has a positive message and I really like that.

5370817,5,B009X919YU,"I belong to a generation who because of when we grew up got to watch Family Matters when it originally aired on ABCs TGIF lineup (later CBS) and in syndication on TBS among other networks. To me, Family Matters will always harken back to a time when my biggest responsibility was being a kid. Part of me wonders how I can possibly be objective under such a strong nostalgic pull but here it goes

Season Three I think began a move away from the Winslow family and focus more on Urkels antics. In this season, its a lot more subtle (the jet pack episode, or the Urkelbot episodes) and certainly not as unbelievable as the transformation chamber or teleportation device of later years of the show. That being said, I think its still a good season from the family centric standpoint. Of course, your mileage may vary. Maybe you enjoy the goofier story lines of the later years.

The comedy of Family Matters and the family dynamic feels much more realistic than most of the shows that air today. I could watch this all day and indeed I flittered away several days rolling through the episodes on these three discs.",1458604800,,1111,4.55

But I've got a bone to pick with Warner Home Video over the technical aspects of this release. for example the first two seasons of the show that were released on DVD contained English stereo surround sound audio (2.0). But for whatever reason, that is not the case for Season 3. Season 3 is in Mono Dolby Digital sound. The sound is coming through one channel: the center speaker. The sound quality is terrible. It might be ok if someone is listening through tv speakers, but if they can give their releases of The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men Widescreen transfers and 5.1 soundtracks, then they can at least give FM a stinkin 2.0 track and SOME special features. Season 4 is due out in February. I want it but Warner Bros had better get it together for that release.",1385769600,,903,4.349112426035503

5370876,5,B009X919YU,"There are some sitcoms that have shows that were good for its time; I put The Cosby Show in this category(few shows have much lasting value). Family Matters whether its Urkel or preUrkel will have that lasting value! Watch as many of the included list as you can and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about!

The person/people behind the Urkel idea had to somehow had been inspired by Dennis the Menace. Carl Winslow became Mr. Wilson and Steve Urkel was a hyper educated Dennis.
Family Matters was a part of TGIF(thank goodness its Friday). ABC had a varying lineup over the years: Dinosaurs; Step-by-Step; Full House; Boy Meets World; etc. What I remember most about the show was how Steve(king nerd) wanted Laura(the show's vixen) more than he wanted to live, she spurned him as if he was rotting cheese every time until the last season or two; Steve mostly builds crap that malfunctions to everyone else's detriment, but every once in a while he follows through with a gem of a device/invention(transformation chamber, Urkebot/cop, cloning chamber, a back rocket, etc.); and Steve always manages to irritate, surprise, and befuddle those in his path(namely, Carl Winslow and his family). My most memorable stars were: Urkel and Waldo. My favorite guests/regulars were: Lieut. Murtaugh; Weasel(loud-talking and arrogant); Capt. Savage; Cassy Lynn; Myra; Rodney; Willie(Larenz Tate); and Stephan Urkelle.
The most memorable shows are these: The very beginning; The A-bomb show; the Urkel bot/cop shows; the report card show(Carl gives incentives for A's); the show where Steve gambles at poker with Carl's friends and boss; the show where Steve dates a nerd girl Susie; the home ec cooking show; the show where Steve glues his hand to Laura; the show where Ted hints that Laura is EASY; the show where she takes him back; the show where Steve floods the junior prom; the show were Steve kisses Cassie Lynn to Laura's personal benefit(school politics); the show where Laura dates Waldo; the parrot show where the parrot repeats, ""Guiess[Carl`s boss] is an idiot!"", after hearing Carl say it; the show where Loonay(it's French) gets married to someone he doesn't even know; the shows where Laura and Myra feud over Steve(cafeteria and beyond); the show where Carl forces Eddie to play basketball(Will the Thrill); Steve thinks Rachel likes him; the show with Buddy Goodrich; the pool hustle(Bullwater, Tx); the first Stephan Urkelle; the 2 episodes where Carl faces life as a nerd; the Shanice show; the Tracy Spencer show(Waldo blasts through an apartment window); Maxine, Laura; Stephan; and Curtis are at odds(Boston cremes); Eddie's hot stereo; Steve and Laura see each other naked; the cloning episode; Eddie becomes a cop; Eddie is too trigger happy for being a cop/Steve is being spied on by Myra(custom glasses); Stephan and Steve play as each other; Steve and Myra break up for good; the Disney World episodes; both Aunt Oona(Donna Summers--woman can sang) episodes; the Christmas show where Christmas tree star lights up on its own at shows end(the original--some re-airs cut that part)/Steve and Laura switch places on this show; the show where Harriet goes to get Laura in her curlers(curfew); the roommates blow up Waldo's stove; the termites show; the shrunk/giant cat show; the family goes to a shrink over Steve; Carl's bombshell partner; Greta first episode; show where Laura and Eddie feud (ending with Eddie in a room full of angry women--Greta included); show where Steve dressing up as Superman for Halloween and he and Laura get robbed while making a bank deposit; first Rachel's Place; Greta and Eddie see each other using Steve behind their boss'(Greta's dad) back; Greta poses naked; the guns episode; and the Elvis(transformation) show.

If you watch those shows you'll be rolling laughing or peak your interest! It comes on on BET! A small percentage of the episodes are over are over-the-top or have over-the-top moments, but no other show has this many memorable episodes: not Cosby; not Fresh Prince; not anybody! Negatives: Could have done without Myrtle Urkel. That was Family Matter's equivalent of Martin's Shenehneh. That's a HUGE problem; a man/boy(Myrtle was) in drag that had dating interest in Eddie Winslow. These episodes were far rarer than those Martin episodes with Shenehneh. I did not include those episodes here as they are just plain nasty and irreligious.",1371686400,,4406,5.109570041608877

The show had a very talented cast, and Steve Urkel (Jaleel White) was able to showcase his amazing physical comedy starting around age 12.  In addition to playing the nerdy neighborhood kid, he also played several alter egos.  The show always represented good family values, but in a way that keeps you laughing.
We have purchased DVDs for the first three seasons, and hope that the remaining six will be produced soon.",1364083200,,474,4.7560975609756095

This is a show that pretty much didn't take off till the Winslow kids and more importantly Urkel, or Stefan if you prefer, grew up!  The first season while funny and all just didn't have the same impact at all as the later seasons.  Getting to see Steve as Stefan sweep Laura off her feet was awesome!  I loved the heated triangle with Steve, Laura and Myra!  I miss these episodes so much and just want to see them again and own them as well!

Both kids had lots of laughs and learned some good family values from these episodes.  As a parent, I enjoyed watching it with them and the characters brought back many childhood memories. I specifically purchased this because it knew the content would be appropriate for my children.  Many shows for kids these days are full of violence or adult humor and I am not interested in that for my family.  These episodes were just right......age- appropriate, funny and educational.

He's  got  a  pet  beetle  in  one  episode,  A  robot  who  settles  for  Laura.
The  season  offers  a  lot  as  far  as  laughing  &  great  humor  goes.
Steve  Urkel  never  disappoints.
