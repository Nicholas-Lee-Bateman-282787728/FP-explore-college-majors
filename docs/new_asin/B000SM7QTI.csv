2887309,1,B000SM7QTI,"If you have a hankering for a good old fashioned mindless propaganda screed, this is the disc for you.  It's already been thoroughly ridiculed for its ham-fisted scare tactics and factual inaccuracies.  The intellectual bankruptcy of the dead-end, less-than-a-third of Americans who still swallow the neo-con con is on full display.  It would be funny if it didn't turn your stomach.  So when even Fox News isn't enough to suppress what remains of your analytical mind from honestly assessing the countless crimes of the current administration (which of course dwarf your pet/petty/invented crimes of the previous one), this deeply cynical, exploitative product should scare it back into submission, right quick.",1189123200,37,712,5.445454545454545
2887310,5,B000SM7QTI,"This film needs to be seen by every citizen(especially the members of our governments) of the remaining free nations! The map alone showing the global spread of Islamic terrorist acts should be an alarming wake-up call,and confirmation of what many ex-mulims have been trying to warn the west of for many years. That the goal of Islam is to establish a worldwide Caliphate!

Probably the most convincing thing about this film that attests to that fact,is the clips from the terrorists themselves,what they,and their religious leaders have to say.

Religion of Peace-GIVE ME A BREAK! That old worn out lie is just that,a complete,total lie. There is nothing about the aims/goals of this false religion that is peaceful. It should be classified as a violent/fanatical ""cult"",and stop calling it a religion!

2887311,3,B000SM7QTI,"First, this *is* a propaganda piece in that it seeks to promote a specific cause, the so-called global war on terror, instead of presenting both sides of a complex global issue.  It is shown by the military to US troops, so you can rest assured it doesn't dwell on the terrors inflicted by US policy and the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  In short, it's one-sided, tending to play up fear of the 150 million (the movie's number) potentially militant Islamic fundamentalists worldwide who want to wage jihad against the West, or so it claims.

However, all this doesn't mean that the one side this film does cover is completely untrue.  It certainly raises the valid issue of *militant* Islam's religious fervor, and that hatred of the US, UK, and Europe at large is seemingly not based on geopolitical issues, but on fervent violent religious beliefs that can't be mitigated through appeasement or rational discourse.  (Though this is where the film and I part ways, because it largely portrays Western culture as faultless, which is a bit naive at best.)

As I said in my title, this movie is worth seeing if for no reason than to hear another viewpoint, but it's not the whole story, so YMMV.",1187568000,16,1202,4.7272727272727275
2887312,5,B000SM7QTI,"Whether you are aware or not, like it or not, the mainstream middle eastern media carries stories and images which denounce the west and encourage radical behavior on a daily basis.  Obsession exposes the slanted middle eastern media and the agenda of the Islamists who encourage their people to hate and kill non-muslims (aka kafirs or infidels) - much of it though lies and disinformation to people whom have little to no real education, outside information or reason to distrust their leaders.  These are people who have been brainwashed since birth to believe only what their religion tells them to believe... or else.  The video exposes Imams, Shieks, Muftis and other Islamic leaders who preach this hate against the west and drive their followers on an agenda of world domination, all while they collect money, enslave their women and live the good life.  Commentary is provided by terrorism experts and ex-muslims who are forced to live in hiding for fear of their lives.  I highly recommend this video to people who want to learn about what's going on in the world right now.

The film paints with broads selective strokes in order to incite fear, anger, hatred, and ultimately, war. The truth is that the ""War on Terror"" has killed, maimed, made homeless, impoverished and terrorized far more innocent people than radical Islam ever has and is directly responsible for fueling the radical elements of Islam. Nearly all Muslims want what every human being wants. Food, shelter, family, friends, work, and to pursue happiness. When you forcibly take these things away from people you radicalize them. This film does not tell you about the oppressions and injustice Muslims are trying to extricate themselves from. Nor does the film add any context whatsoever as to understanding the reasons radical Islam exists. It's as if they are evil aliens born blood thirsty and not human beings who've arrived at this place due to education, frustration, and circumstance. If we want to solve a problem, we must first understand the problem. This film does nothing to help us understand radical Islam.",1185840000,32,1107,5.121546961325967

This documentary explains the Nazi alliance with the grand mufti of Jerusalem and its ramifications not only in the middle east but in Europe and the Balkans as well.  While many great accomplishments adorn the history of Islam, there is a strain that would seek to reclaim its greatness in a way utterly abhorrent to western values.

This documentary is well directed, produced and thoroughly researched.  It is not anti-Islamic, but exposes the alarming trend of anti-western hatred that has festered in the Muslim world over the last century and how this hatred has been inculcated in the current generation of Arab muslims.  Those who would dismiss it as anti-Islamic propaganda simply have not seen it or do not want Americans to see it.

 Getting tired of hearing the nonsensical (cultural suicidal) lies from the established politically correct ""white guilt"" driven mainstream media & academia crowd regarding the monsters American & other nations around the world face?  Then this is a documentary for you.

 Terror in the form of Isis and Al-Qaeda are still on the rise, poised to attack this nation again until they achieve their goal of re-establishing a Caliphate & dominating most of the world.

 This film, in the addition with the 2008 Dutch documentary ""Fitna"", are essential expose pieces speaking truth to power regarding a dark and sinister violent ideology Hell bent on brutalizing this world like a group of unhinged savages.

2887322,4,B000SM7QTI,"""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil ... is for good men to do nothing.""  Edmund Burke, Irish Philospher & Statesmen

This pertinent quote opens up ""Obsession,"" a film about the danger that radical Islam poses to the entire world.  Right from the offset, the makers of the film clearly state that it is about Islamists, those who want to conquer the world for Islam and impose Sharia globally, and not about Muslims who are peaceful and do not want to wage Jihad on the rest of humanity.  It is important to point out what the film itself says, because all the Islamophiles in the West automatically accuse anyone who opposes the Islamization of the globe, radical terror and Jihad of being Islamophobic.

Directed by Wayne Kopping, who has written extensively on Islam and Jihad, the movie comprises several sections: ""The Culture of Jihad,"" ""The Culture of Hate,"" ""Jihad in the West,"" ""Common Denominators,"" ""We've Been Here Before"" and ""What Do Radical Muslims Want.""  Together they detail a global Jihad that is being waged by Islamists, and it is a campaign that the West ignores at its own peril.  As Nonie Dawish says at one point about the World Trade Center, ""When I saw the second plane hit, I knew that Jihad had come to America.""

In addition to Nonie Dawish, Steven Emerson, Caroline Glick, Walid Shoebat. Tahbih Sayyed, Itamar Marcus, John Loftus, Khaled Abu Toameh and Brigitte Gabriel are all featured.  Each brings an insight into what is happening when this movie was made and is still happening today.

There are flaws with this documentary.  It makes a great deal of comparisons between Nazism and Islamism, but there are strong differences.  The Nazis only wanted to conquer Europe up to the Urals; Islamists want to conquer the whole world.  Hitler and his associates only rarely mentioned the possibility of the Jews' being wiped out should there be a war; Islamists in mosques everywhere are constantly declaiming their plans for conquest and for wiping out the infidels, both Jews and Christians.  The two ideologies have some similarities, but they are not the same.  Like communism, the Islamist ideology is unlimited in its ambitions.

Having said that, ""Obsession"" does well in raising the awareness of the viewer to the greatest threat to freedom that exists today, and it is hoped that it will motivate people to take action both here and abroad.  Brigitte Gabriel has an interesting observation when she notes that Islamists know how to use our laws and democracy against us.  The same holds true for their traitorous Islamophile supporters in the West.  Under the guise of upholding democracy, the politically correct in Western media and academia are working to destabilize the entire Middle East, to create chaos and to overthrow regimes that oppose radicalism from Morocco to Egypt to Syria to Bahrain.  This campaign is designed to bring the Islamists to power everywhere.

To quote Nonie Dawish again, she clearly sums up what it is that the Islamists desire, ""As a child I attended the Gaza elementary school, and we were taught that Jihad is a religious, holy war for the sake of Allah.  That is what it is: To conquer the world for Allah.  That is Jihad!""  That is what the interviews and presentations in this film reveal: The Islamists want to conquer the whole world and impose Sharia upon all who dwell on it.

Gabriel goes on to make one of the most crucial statements in the film when she says, ""The Western world needs to stand up and support the voices of the moderates.  ...  The Western World needs to support them and needs to do everything we can to empower them.""

This is so very important.  With governments such as the constitutional monarchy of King Mohammed VI in Morocco, the fragile democracy in Tunisia, the more-authoritarian democracy of President Sisi in Egypt and monarchy in Bahrain all working to stave off the Islamists, we should doing everything we can with aid and assistance, with reducing quotas and tariffs on their products, with technical and scientific support, to back them fully.  They are the fortresses that stand against the radicals.  Even the regime of Bashar Al-Assad is opposed to the Sunni fundamentalists, and our attempt to overthrow it and not reach an accommodation is sorely misguided and could lead to disaster.

""Obsession"" is a clarion bell to which the West should listen.

When I found out that 20+ million copies had been distributed throughout the US, I didn't feel very special.  And I finally got around to watching it in 2011.  How's that for a delay?

The film is a documentary of sorts.  It certainly documents the rantings of some people who profess a great hatred of the United States and a few other countries and cultures, and promotes violence against them.  The fact that violence IS carried out through acts of terrorism allows this to be seen as true.  There are crazies out there, and I don't doubt the reality and truthfulness of the snippets revealing the hate-mongering.  I mean, there certainly is something that promotes the behaviors that resulted in the destruction of the Twin Trade Towers, right?

I understand that this film is controversial, in part because it doesn't go far enough in separating the violent practitioners of Islam from the hundreds of millions of peaceful practitioners.  That is probably also true.  But that topic is allowed to have its own movie, and this one is not it.

I see the utility of this particular film being shown not to generate fear, but to demonstrate that there truly are a wide variety of people ""out there,"" and some are not very nice.

2887351,5,B000SM7QTI,"I have watched ""Obsession"" in its entirety several times now. When I first watched the movie I was not particularly surprised to see Islamic extremists calling for a holy war against the West and for the destruction of America, but what did surprise me was the number of educated men and leaders in the worldwide Muslim community that were presented in the movie making these calls for violence and terrorism. For example we see in the movie how on 24 August 2001, Dr. Ikrirne Sabri, the Mufti of Palestine, the senior religious figure in the Palestinian authority prayed on the radio for God to destroy Israel, Great Britain and the United States.

One may argue that ""Obsession"" shows just a handful of radical extremists, a few of whom are in a position of influence, but I think there is more to the underlying threat than a few radicals. In Obsession we see crowds of Muslims dancing in the streets and celebrating the terrorist attacks against the United States on 11 September 2001. We see similar crowds stirred into a frenzy burning American flags and effigies of American leaders. These are not just a few radical young men expressing their hate and dissent, rather the Muslims dancing in the streets to celebrate terrorist attacks are the common population of Muslim communities.

""Obsession"" states that radical Islam is at war with the West, and that ""the tentacles of terrorism are reaching out across the world."" The threat of worldwide terrorism cannot be denied, nor as we see in the movie ""Obsession"", can we deny the fact that this terrorism stems from Islam. While the movie stresses that it is a radical and extremist element within Islam that is conducting terrorism in the name of their faith; when we see Muslim communities dancing in the streets to celebrate terrorist attacks we have to ask ourselves how deeply this radical vein runs into the average Muslim community. One of the greatest threats that we face is the idea that Islamic terrorism stems only from a few extremists in the Islamic faith.

Dr. Daniel Pipes, Director of the Middle East Forum states in the movie that he estimates that 10-15 percent of the world's Muslim population supports militant Islam. With more than one-billion Muslims in the world, 10 - 15 percent is a significant threat. But he also points out that the number of Muslims who are ""anti-American"" or ""anti-Zionist"" is far greater than that 10-15 percent.

We see a Jordanian/Palestinian school book from 1998 which states: ""This religion [Islam] will destroy all other religions through the Islamic Jihad fighters."" We see young school children reciting ""Jihadist"" poetry and stating their desire to march to their deaths in the name of Allah. Itamar Marcus of Palestinian Media Watch points out in ""Obsession"" just how mainstream the concepts of radical Islam have become in the Muslim world.

Another fact that is pointed out in the movie is that these Islamic extremists and terrorists are using our own laws, our own tolerance and diversity against us. We see in ""Obsession"" how the 9/11 terrorists trained to conduct their attacks against the United States from within the United States. The Islamic terrorists of 11 September 2001 were admitted into the United States, issued driver's licenses (which helped them pass as Americans), and trained to fly aircraft at American schools.

""Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West"" is essential viewing for anyone trying to understand what is happening with terrorism in the world today, and perhaps most importantly understanding the root of the majority of all transnational terrorism. The world is at war, not against any country or nation, but against a belief indoctrinated into young school children until their obsession is to march to their own deaths. While it may be true that most Muslims are not terrorists, we must take note of the fact that most [transnational] terrorists are in fact Muslims.

After watching the propaganda, I broke the DVD in half and sent it back to the distibutors who had sent it to me. The direction of the film deliberately pulled the viwer into a crescendo of fear and hate for faceless terrorists who are attempting to thwart American freedoms and happiness. If you have half a brain you can see the film for what it is: an attempt to polarize Americans and Muslims, a manipulative attempt to justify the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The film plays on the emotions of Americans who are  largely ignorant of the real things that they should fear: un-checked consumerism, spiraling obesity, a shoddy national education system, broke down infra-structures, un-regulated health insurance companies, etc. The film is meant to distract us from the home grown terror all around us.

a one sided cut rate video that does not take into account that the US government trained and supported the taliban against russia in the cold war or that the zionists are committing genocide against the Palestinians.

nor does it mention that most anti-islamic sentiment aka (anti-semitism proper) is fed by radical zionism and radical christianity in the republicrat party. it refuses to admit that this war on terror is  a backlash with the wahabist and shia muslims (Shirk) against zionism and isreal and even a possible ruse for a war for illegally  aqcuiring natural resources.  typically the sunnis muslims are not ever involved in any form of support of murder and war. the majority of muslims are sunnis and most sunnis are against any from of terrorism. this video is dangerous because it leaves out almost all the important facts about muslims, islam and jihad and at best briefly mentions it in passing and does not point this fact out.

if they were honest they would admit that Zionist Christians and Jews in DC are making this war possible. most anti-terrorism is really a mask of anti-Islam.
look up muslim Demographics and you will find out that every single person in the USA in 25 years or less will know a muslim family in their town and/or block and that they will meet a american convert that is white and from a christian background and in 50 years the majority of americans will be muslims. the facts are that you will be related to a muslim with in 20-60 years time. you will have a muslim relative in 100 years, every single one of us will know and see or speak to muslims on a daily basis in 10-20 years. one of your children will to convert to islam at some time or marry one or your grandchildren will. No there is nothing wrong with this but facts are facts the USA will have a muslim majority in 50 years or less and if the war on terror ended today or not,  it would not stop islam from coming to the west.

nor will they admit that Iraq is being turned radioactive with depleted uranium bullets a slow horrible from of genocide against the Iraqi people that will destroy that nation in a few decades. nor will they tell you that the USA has a serious codeine shortage and Afghanistan and Iraq had huge amounts of opium fields and hemp fields and the mountains are filled with natural gas reserves that will be able to supply the world for hundreds of years.. again the middle east and near middle east has another thing that the US, Israel and Brittan can not control with out genocide against it's occupants.

2887357,5,B000SM7QTI,"Out of six documentaries I have viewed concerning terrorism, this one is the best, in my opinion. Others I have seen focus mainly on the history of Islam, or on one suicide bomber, or quote select verses from the Koran and comment on them, or focus on a relatively small number of the most damaging terrorist attacks in terms of death and destruction. This documentary is different in that it shows actual images broadcast on Arab television. Translated by [...] and [...] these are actual scenes that have been broadcast on:
1) Palestinian TV
2) Iranian TV
3) Al-Manar TV (Lebanon)
4) Iqra TV or Iqraa TV (Saudi Arabia)
5) Al Arabiya (Al-Qaeda exclusive)
6) Iraqi TV
7) Al Maja TV (UAE)
8) Al-Jazeera TV
9) Al-Qaeda training video
10) Bahrain TV
11) Abu Dhabi TV
12) Palestinian Authority TV
13) Internet
14) Al Majd TV
15) UAE TV
and more

Some reviewers have claimed that this documentary is propaganda, but images do not lie. In fact, this documentary spends more time showing the images than it does commenting on them. For all Americans who asked, ""Why do they hate us?"" following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, then this documentary will show you why. Not only are adults shown commenting, but young children are shown, as well. Also revealed are startling similarities between images of recent Palestinian propaganda to Nazi propaganda of the 1930s and 1940s, shocking depictions of Jews.

This documentary is not purely one-sided, either. It begins by showing peaceful Muslims, stating that most Muslims are peaceful, and that this documentary is not about them. Additionally, the documentary ends by showing Muslims marching and protesting against terrorist attacks, encouraging more to do the same. The producers of this documentary make it clear that they are not painting the peaceful Muslim majority with the same brush as that of the radical minority. This documentary is a must-see for everyone who has never viewed Arab television, which presumably applies to most Westerners.",1237507200,9,1990,5.009063444108762
2887358,5,B000SM7QTI,"A religion should not be judged by its adherents, but by its holy writings. Humans can twist a religion and misuse it to support their own ideas and desires. The holy writings describe the true foundation and tenents of the religion.

The Koran and Hadiths show us a violent religion bound on wiping Israel and all Jews off the face of the earth. Infidels (Jews & Christians above all) are to be killed. Lying, stealing, cheating, etc., are good, if done to further Islam.

Islam is NOT just a religion, it is a system of government. You cannot separate Islam from Sharia law. Allow the Muslims to take over, and you lose your country's government to Islam.

I think the selection of people the producers chose to interview for the film, and the general outline, can be fairly criticized as being too selective.  But even if you took out all the interviews and narration, and simply showed the radical clips from mainstream Islamic TV, it would be plain to see that there exists a hardened core of radical Islamists that has no basis in rational thinking.  They are not, as some Muslim apologists and 'liberal' pundits would like us to believe, engaged in a logical effort to right the wrongs of Western colonialism.  They are convinced, religiously and ideologically, that the ruler of the universe wants our entire planet to be dominated by Islamic teachings, and anyone that resists should be killed. People that put semi-automatic rifles in the hands of children, or strap suicide bombs to them, and teach them recite death wishes, are not people we can make friends with by apologizing for some perceived wrong. They are crackpots, plain and simple. The West's task, as pointed out in the end of the film, is not to wage war against Islam, but to support the moderate and rational Muslim communities so that they can suppress the radicalism. Israel has been repeatedly attacked from all sides by multiple Arab nations, in coordinated military operations intended to destroy the tiny Jewish state. Israel defeated these attempts each time, and justifiably took a tiny bit more land from its attackers to serve as a buffer for future attacks that the Arabs promised would come.

Though not entirely objective the film makers made a point a tfocusing on the use of religious ideology to achieve political and military ends and how absolutely strong, decisive and unwielding the believers are.  Most Americans have never seen Saudi or Iranian TV broadcasts, read newspapers from Iran/Saudi Arabia/Syria; but they should to see just how vehomently these people hate us and how widespread this system of belief is.  Now I have Muslim friends, and even they think this should be watched so that people can see the power of Jihadi thought.  Alos that thought is not half way across the world, it is here in America. I travled across the globe to many placea nd it is everywhere, on the streets of New York, In Deerbourne, Michigan, out in California.

While it is prefaced with the statement that not all Muslims are of this radical strain, by the time it gets about halfway through and estimates of 10-15% of all Muslims (numbering roughly 1 billion people) are supportive of this radical Islam, its a very real wakeup call.  Whether or not that number is fair or accurate I don't know.

But when the images of preachers of hate come at you one after the other and images of young children speak of being martyrs or dying for Allah, the viewer quickly realizes that this is in fact quite disturbing and it is not going away.

What stood out most of all was the comparison of this strain of Islamo-Fascism with Nazism, the ties between the two drawn explicitly by the rise of a Panzer division of Muslims in Bosnia due to the allegiance of ideology between Hitler and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.  It's quite a stunning climax.

The weakest part of the film is tracing its historical roots.  There is some brief mention of its history but it lacks depth and context.  In this, I fear, it will simply reinforce or further aggrandize those who already think Islam is only this.

Whether or not the conclusions and the fears stirred up by this documentary hold up with some distance from it, it does provide a very clear perspective that needs to be considered.",1228003200,8,1438,4.517374517374518
2887364,3,B000SM7QTI,"Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West,"" a documentary by Wayne Kopping, is nothing if not controversial.  And, it may, indeed, be a bit one-sided.  But everybody is entitled to express their point of view in this country.

Kopping has found and integrated many little-known clips from Arabic-language television, including one horrifying little drama about Jews seeking a boy's blood to make their Passover matzos.  He also draws explicit parallels between the Jewish hatred of Nazi Germany, and the Jewish hatred we are now seeing among Islamic radical anti-Americans.  He has interviewed Sir Martin Gilbert, well-known historian; Professor Robert Wistrich, and Prof. Alan Dershowitz, among others.  His aim: to show us the hatred the Islamic radicals are teaching their young, their desire to incite global jihad, and their aim of world domination.

In recent years these terrorists have, of course, attacked New York's World Trade Center twice, the Pentagon, transportation systems in London and Madrid, hotels in Bali and Egypt, American shipping, soldiers' barracks and embassies, and we've seen all this carnage in color on our TV's.  Yet we see here a clip of left-winger Michael Moore denying terrorism exists, and we hear that various other deniers claim that Jewry and/and or the American government itself are responsible for this bloodshed.  And who can forget Ward Le Roy Churchill, former professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who, shortly after the attacks of 9/11/2001, wrote an article entitled ""On the Justice of Roosting Chickens,"" in which he claimed that people killed in the WTC attack had somehow brought it upon themselves.

So this film can function as a useful corrective to all these many deniers that surround us.  Hopefully, it's not so alarmist and propagandist as to be off-putting to the open-minded general audience, and end up preaching only to the choir.",1227312000,12,1931,5.277777777777778
2887365,5,B000SM7QTI,"Obsession does a very good job in presenting what, how and who is using one the largest religions in the world to spread hate, violence and death. This isn't a DVD saying that all of Islam, or Muslims are out to destroy America and the West, because they aren't.

What this DVD does is show you how the extremists go about convincing the average Joe that violence is not only the way, but the best way to combat the west. The use of religion for violence isn't anything new, a Muslim suicide bomber attaching tourists is not worse than the Evangelical Christian bombing an abortion clinic. Both groups are using a religion as an excuse for murder and it is wrong. But the average American can not fathom how the average Arab in a place like Iran thinks. And while this DVD will not suddenly pull up the blinds and enlighten you, it does a good job at presenting the facts of the matter. It isn't a clear cut 'this is right and this is wrong' but a look at the matter from a fairly clinical position.

That being said this DVD can serve to just stoke the flames of hatred against Muslims as well. It is hard not to be angry when you see tiny children talking about how they want to kill and burn western leaders. Or listen to people celebrating the bombing of the Twin Towers on 911. Or watching the burning of American bodies in Fallujah.

2887372,2,B000SM7QTI,"I strongly disagree that the film--as some negative reviewers have noted--tars all Muslims as terrorist.  It begins with the standard ""the Muslim religion is beautiful"" apology before stringing together twelve or so years of footage together to try to prove that international jihad is the new Nazism, and that all who disagree have their heads in the proverbial Neville Chamberlain sand.

Now imagine you live in Indonesia and a fellow Indonesian gathers a couple decades worth of KKK footage and puts it together with ominous music plus converts-from-the-dark-side and converted-daughters-of-the-dark-side talking heads.  How can you refute it?  Now no one, of course, believes that the threat of the KKK is on the level of the Islamofascists--but that's not the point.  The point is how capable are you really to judge the actual threat posed in this film?  How well can you really judge this slanted movie?  Now much of the footage is important and true.  It's true that much of the Middle East erupted in euphoria after 9/11.  It's true that young children in some Middle Eastern countries are indoctrinated to hate the west and Isreal to the overzealous extent of wanting to give their young lives to the cause. And there are plenty of groups, even governments, that advocate destruction of the west.  The clips in the film well represent these valid points.  Yet it is dangerous to go from that belief to what another reviewer claims:

""The evidence and footage displayed in this film are genuine and would be very difficult to discount or dispute. How anyone can claim 'ignorance' in the face of that evidence is beyond reason and common sense.""

The reviewer seems not to realize that films can be highly manipulative in their arrangement of facts, and that's exactly what propaganda does.  I don't totally reject the film, but too many red flags were flying as it rolled for me to be comfortable.

The facts in the film are marshaled to conflate Arab anti-Israelism to Nazism, for one.  This falls even short of a blatant and dangerous half truth.  Jews are fond of making this claim, and it is certainly true that it often looks like textbook anti-semitism.  But I seem to recall some deep history of a group being pushed out of their homeland and marginalized, colonized, and denied a homeland for many decades.  Whether you react to this statement with hostility or not, anyone with knowledge of this issue has to admit that the film totally ignores a rich, important context here to make an absolutist point.  And incidentally, regarding the claim that negative reviewers to ""Obsession"" are politically correct, nothing is more politically correct in the US than being pro-Israeli.  (The most politically correct moment in the current election so far:  Joseph Biden, in last Thursday's VP debate with Sarah Palin, saying that his keystone criterion for joining the ticket was Obama's fervent Israeli advocacy.)

How foolish to claim that jihadists just, plain, hate the west.  No reasoning with savages, right?  (Again, trot out Chamberlain on cue.)

A question for the film:  where in the film are the Taliban, the biggest fascists in the Muslim world?  I guess when the movie was made (2004-2005?), the Taliban must have seemed like history and therefore, not important to the forward thinking agenda of this film?  If only we had known how to pick and choose, we'd be in 1000x better position.  Invade Afghanistan--yes;  Invade Iraq--no.  I'm guessing that the ""Obsession"" filmmakers would advocate the wide-net yes approach--except for a big fat no to Palestinians.

And I agree that the timing of this film's free distribution--it came with my Sunday paper a week ago--is designed to cause anxiety and fear in order to sway people toward McCain.  It's a tactic straight out of the Bush-Rove playbook.

2887375,4,B000SM7QTI,"The threat of radical Islam is out there and is rather obvious.  How big it really is that is difficult to assess.  I do agree with the authors that we must not stick our heads into sand and ignore it.  However, the movie does smells like propaganda, especially since it was distributed during election season.  But since I haven't gone to their website and learned more about the authors I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that their motive is raise general awareness.  Hence the four stars.

But to me, general awareness is not the right question.  I believe that a much more pressing question is ""how to properly deal with such a threat?""  If the militant imams and Madrasas are the sources of instigation, hate and recruitment for militants, what have we done in the past eight years to deal with it?  What alternatives have we provided or supported in the Muslim world?  Do we sponsor or support schools and provide proper education so that their youth has alternatives?  What legal actions can we take without abandoning our constitutional rights to prevent the spread of militant Islam on our soil?  And the list of questions goes on....

I wish the movie addressed these issues or at least offered suggestion on what it is the authors believe is a proper course of action.  But to simply point that there is a threat and we should therefore support the authors' foundation in order to combat it isn't adequate in my mind.  It sounds a lot like a scare tactic.  But once again, I do give the authors credit for putting this together and reminding us as we tend to forget while we go about our busy lives.  We must not let our guards down and remain vigilant in our fight against evil.  However, we must be sure we're taking the right course.",1222387200,7,1753,4.564102564102564

They continue to try and scare people into believing that there is this huge clash of civilizations, where muslims are on a mission to destroy the west. Their main goal is to place the legitimate resistance that Palestinians are engaged( which is a right they maintain under international law) into a larger group of terrorist acts, so to give the israeli government justification for their sick and disgusting occupation of another peoples land, among all the other crimes against humanity they have committed over the last 6 decades. The movie also starts out with that now popular narrative that Not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims. Also the people they use in this movie have some real credibility issues among them Walid Shoebat the "" Former Palestinian terrorist"" who people within the PLO have never heard of, and can never prove his involvement in any terrorist acts. The seriously don't get conned by these racist individuals who are intent on conning Americans into believing our struggle is their struggle, but America's struggle which is just and righteous can never be the same as Israelis racist, repressive and just mentally disturbing struggle to justify their occupation and deny others the freedom and dignity all humans deserve.

2887380,1,B000SM7QTI,"Watch the 12 minute trailer (available on Google Video) and you'll get a good idea of what to expect: Fear mongering and lies by omission.

For instance, the trailer implies the ""Radicals"" are just making up an excuse to fear ""the west."" Is anyone so ignorant as to accept this premise? Has anyone told the producers of this film that ""Operation Ajax"" is now DECLASSIFIED and admitted? (You know, where the CIA went into Iran in 1953 and, using false flag attacks, overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddeq. That the CIA then installed the ruthless dictator, The Shah, who brutalized the people of Iran until he was overthrown in 1979?) If that doesn't count as open ""aggression"" I don't know what does.

-Seriously though, why go back that far? Just look at Iraq - read the Project for a New American Century's ""Rebuilding America's Defenses"" report (written in September of 2000.) In it you will find this little gem that explains exactly why hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqi men, woman and children are now dead:

""In the Persian Gulf region, the presence of American forces, along with British and French units, has become a semipermanent fact of life.""

""Though the immediate mission of those forces is to enforce the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq, they represent the long-term commitment of the United States and its major allies to a region of vital importance. Indeed, the United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. ""

""While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.""

I know...some of you probably still think Saddam was behind 9/11....or the Anthrax attacks, or had ""weapons of mass destruction"" or ""had ties to Bin Laden"" (or any of the other LIES that were told to sell the policy outlined above.) Wake up - it was a war of aggression, plain and simple.

Lebanon in 2006? Anyone remember that?  Let's recap: Israeli soldiers (legitimate military targets in an ongoing conflict) are caught ACROSS the border - 3 are killed and 2 are taken prisoner in the skirmish that follows. In response, ""the west"" provides the go ahead (and the weapons) to bomb civilian infrastructure and kill thousands of innocent civilians. Regardless of where you stand on the ""Israeli / Palestinian conflict,"" I'm not sure how anyone could support this blatant act of collective punishment. (Hardly paints the picture of a ""fabricated threat."")

How about ""modern day"" Iran?  Let's see, the US Government has already overthrown your government once and installed a dictator, now it has you surrounded on both sides (after invading both Afghanistan and Iraq) it has threatened a NUCLEAR ""first strike,"" and the vice president (Dick Cheney) has openly suggested painting up US boats to look like Iranian PT boats, having the fake Iranian boats fire on US ships, and then using the incident as an excuse (blaming your country for an attack it had nothing to do with) to bomb you back into the stone age.

Did that sink in? Let's put it this way:  Iran has never overthrown our elected officials, it has never invaded our neighbors, it has never threatened us with nuclear weapons, it has never conspired to stage an incident to provide a pretext for war against us. The criminals running our government (on the other hand) have done ALL OF THE ABOVE to Iran...and yet IRAN (with a military that couldn't even defeat Saddam when he was ""our guy"") are a threat to US!

Oh ya, back to the premise I'm refuting: They're just ""making it up"" that ""the west"" is a threat.

Only a person incapable of seeing the situation from the reverse perspective could buy into this crap. I'll try one more time: (Hypothetical) China overthrows our government 55 years ago and installs a brutal dictator, we finally throw the dictator out, but then China invades Mexico to our South. Then, it fabricates a reason to invade Canada to our north (killing hundreds of thousands of INNOCENT people in the process...)  With the US surrounded, it then threatens a nuclear ""first strike"" and conspires to CREATE an incident that makes it ""look like"" we attacked China (to be used as an excuse to attack us.) All along claiming that WE ARE THE THREAT!!! Would it be very hard to imagine ""anti-Chinese"" sentiment in the US?

The sad truth is this: Criminals seized control of our government decades ago. The current beneficiaries (the NeoCons) only benefit from ""Radical Muslims"" and ""terrorist attacks."" (Both justify their criminal wars of conquest and the further destruction of our Constitution and Bill of Rights.) The hatred they're creating in the Middle East suits their needs perfectly. -These men (and the ""special interests"" that control them) are a far greater threat to our freedom and way of life than the bogeymen presented in this film. -But if they're lucky, you won't figure that out until they've totally destroyed our country.",1222128000,42,5049,4.915393654524089

This is very well directed and produced video that does a wonderful job of revealing the current trend in Islam that the US media does not want to portray (though I am not completely sure why) - particularly the radical Jihadic movement. Most of the footage I have never even seen before, but was eye-opening... and particularly discomforting to think about, especially with the next 10-20 years in mind.

This video does not bash Islamic society by any means, but it does show the full impact that radical Jihad is having upon it. The majority of interviewees were of Arab descent and grew up Muslim, so it was very evident that they had a real appreciation for what is happening.

This video also uncovers the propaganda techniques (the same as Hilter's) that the radical Jihadist are using to turning them - the everyday Muslim - against us (the West - particularly the US and Israel).
The really sad part is that they are doing it to the children...

If the creators of this movie wanted to get something positive accomplished, rather than focusing completely on the hate, they would have given us an undertanding of where it comes from, and how to deal with it in a constructive way.  To say that there's nothing we can do is to actually disempower all of us who CAN make a difference, and to essentially demonize them the way we believe we are being demonized.

It lays bare the scope of Islamo-Nazism and terror, and that the Islamic extremists want nothing less than total destruction of Israel and Jews, Islamic domination over the entire earth, and total subjection of all non-Muslims (kuffars).
The film captures footage of Islamist rallies around the world, including in London and the USA.
It also clearly shows the parallels between Islamo-Nazism and the German Nazism of the 1930s and 40s.
Scholar after scholar including Nonie Darwish (the daughter of a terrorist), former PLO operative Walid Shoebat, Alan M. Dershowitz, Steven Emerson, Brigitte Gabriel, Martin Gilbert, Caroline Glick, Alfons Heck, Glen Jenvey, John Loftus, Salim Mansur, Itamar Marcus, Khaleel Mohammed, Daniel Pipes, Tashbih Sayyed, Walid Shoebat, Khaled Abu Toameh, Robert Wistrich.
Historian Martin Gilbert, probably the most prolific scholar of 20th century history, and foremost expert on Nazism and the Holocaust, draws on his vast knowledge to explore the striking and chilling similarities between Islamo-Nazism and German Nazism.
Alfons Heck, a Hitler Youth Member as a boy, explores the psychology of hate taught by the Nazis and sees the powerful parallels with the Islamic fanaticism of today. Walid Shoebat and Nonie Darwish speak of their own brainwashing to hatred.
And this is proved again and again, by clippings of Arab children reciting the results of their brainwashing on Palestinian TV, and a Syrian TV documentary recycling the ancient anti-Semitic blood libel that Jews use the blood of gentile children to bake matzos.
As Alfons Heck explains, the Nazis and Islamic fundamentalists both aim to demonize Jews to pave the way for their total annihilation.
We are shown this with the aid of cartoons appearing in the Arab press of today and Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the 1940s which are chillingly identical.
We also see shots of victims of the Nazi genocide of Islamic terror.
Finally it must be stressed clearly, despite the lies that leftist apologists for Islamo-Nazism peddle, that this movie is not anti-Muslim, but anti Islamo-Nazism and it's supporters and terrorists.
In fact we are exhorted to support the Muslims and Arabs out there who have taken a stand against Islamo-Nazi terror.
They are few who have spoken up and they need the support of the West.
As Brigitte Gabriel explains we are being strangled by our political correctness.
We see a clip of a supercilious Michael Moore, pontificating pompously that 'there is no terrorist threat' and of his counterpart from the 1930s Neville Chamberlain assuring us of Hitler's peaceful intentions.
Islamo-Nazi is potentially an even greater threat than Hitler's Nazi Germany, because it is metamorphosing in many countries.
Can we save the world from another inferno, and mass genocide, or will we strangled by our political correctness.

There are especially troubling scenes of Islamic children being brainwashed in ways similar to Nazi youth in the 1940s.  The cultural brainwashing continues in the form of videos falsely depicting Jews cutting throats to get blood to make Matzo bread.  The irony is that the Islamic propagandists are accusing the Jews of doing exactly what the Islamists themselves do.  Other Islamic Jihad tactics are revealed such as leaders saying one thing to Western journalists and the opposite to Muslims.  Yasser Arafat is shown doing this.  Another case in point, is Anjem Choudary Al-Muhajiroun, who tells London TV in 2002 that ""the actions of flying airplanes filled with innocent civilians into buildings is not legitimate""; but later, when speaking to an Islamic audience on 9/11/03, he refers to ""the magnificent 19"" who ""split the world in half.""

I completely disagree with another reviewer who claims Americans don't need a wakeup call - we most certainly do, because most Americans do not really understand the jihadist threat and its infiltration in the West. It's not just some vague little problem in distant Pakistan or Iraq - it's a worldwide danger, and this documentary captures chilling evidence, in their own words, of the jihadis' evil agenda. I do agree with another reviewer that this documentary is too short (and that's why I'm rating it only 4 stars), and that those interviewed could have been given much more time to expound, but this is nonetheless an excellent starting point for Americans who need to be shocked out of their complacency and naivete.  As for the reviewer who claims that an equally alarming documentary could be made about Christian televangelists - well, that would be laughable if it weren't so dangerously wrongheaded.

I urge you not only to own this documentary but to spread the word to everyone you know about it.  It isn't the last word on the subject - yes, maybe a better documentary is still to be made. But this work needs to be supported and promoted.

UPDATE, Oct. 3, 2008: I've noticed that in the last week or so, not only has my review received several unhelpful votes (where it had only one before), but the DVD itself has received six new one-star reviews (where it had only 4 before). The timing of this negativity clearly stems from the recent controversial free mailing of this DVD in certain areas of the country. People are obviously coming to Amazon to trash the DVD and its positive reviews - people who don't like to be reminded that we actually face a threat from radical Islam (and yes, I said RADICAL Islam, not all Muslims - the same disclaimer clearly noted at the very beginning of Obsession, which many like to ignore); people who are wallowing in cultural self-doubt and anti-Americanism; people who desperately want to believe that if we Ugly Americans just stop being Islamophobic, everything will be grand; and people who almost certainly didn't even bother to watch Obsession.

  This film is accurate, but only on the subject of the radicals. One-sided information is called ""propaganda."" The trouble is we don't expect people we trust to use propaganda, so we aren't on the alert for it. (Check out a book called ""Covering Islam"" if you don't believe me. It's ALSO one-sided, but a side Americans aren't acquainted with.)

  If we want to fight radical Islam (and I agree we gotta fight it!) we have to see the other side and not confuse all Muslims with the radicals. Americans are so one-minded about Islam that when some Kuwaiti created a new comic book with superheros based on Muslim virtues at least one true-blue American website trashed it by saying there ""are no Muslim virtues except for blowing yourself up."" I mean, do people like that hear themselves? That kind of prejudice  gives the Jihadis the excuse to say that all Americans hate Muslims!

  (Just for the record, I was curious and found a copy of the comic -- the heroes stand for things like Strength, Generosity, the Light of Truth, etc., and the one hero who was out for revenge, repents and heals the guy he had earlier gotten revenge on. Very uplifting stuff.)

  I expect I'll get a lotta people disagreeing with me, but like I say, we're already awake to the dangers of Jihad. What we REALLY gotta wake up to is the many, many reasonable Muslims out there.

If you are in the ""why can't we sit down an negotiate"" crowd, do some research and then ask that question OF YOURSELF!

Google or Yahoo has many links to English translations of the Koran (and many of its other spellings).  Try ""browse koran"" for your search term.

When you get it, open it up to chapter 9, then read the first few verses (this is the ISLAMIC BIBLE!!!).  I'll help you translate it... It sez they have exactly 2 choices.  YOU MUST EITHER ... BOW DOWN TO ALLAH, and pay the poor taxes ... or THEY MUST SLAY YOU!!!

2887439,5,B000SM7QTI,"ONE SOLID DOCUMENTARY.

Clearly this documentary can only focus on one aspect of radical Islam since it has a limited amount of time to make it's points.  The topic is indoctrination of the Muslim world with radical jihadist ideology, and how that is causing global jihad to spread war against many different countries and peoples.  Footage of Arab television is stunning.

This film presents only one piece of the puzzle of radical Islam.  Yet it is a great piece of the puzzle to start with.  You'll witness the massive power and energy invested in poisoning the minds of Arabs and Muslims worldwide, hijacking Islam, and threatening the world.

SOME (of many) GOOD POINTS:
1) Towards the end of the film, they make a most crucial statement: The people who need the most support in fighting radical Islam are those Muslims who do NOT support the radicalization of their religion.  Currently, such muslims must put their families lives at risk if they wish to speak out against the Islamists.  Yet Western politicians and media have continued to fail in supporting moderate muslims, while doling out support for radical groups such as CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations).

2) An additional point that the film makes - although subtly since this point kind of goes against the film's title - is that radical Islam is not only attacking the West, but is attacking non-Muslim Africans in Darfur, Buddhists in Asia, and their very own fellow Arabs in the middle east.  Caroline Glick, one of the interviewees, makes the point that these ongoing conflicts are not unrelated, despite the Western media spinning them that way.

RESPONSE TO ONE-STAR REVIEWS:
The only people I've met and read online who respond negatively to this film are those who find more ""facts"" and ""professionalism"" in conspiracy theory films.

Many people find it difficult to face the fact that muslim terrorists come from an entirely different world than Westerners are used to, or can even imagine.  Such people find it easier to create detailed and overly intricate stories to explain global jihad, such as the CIA or the Bush Administration, etc. than to accept the reality of our world today.

Meanwhile brave Arabs and Muslims, such as the men and women featured in Obsession, come to tell their stories about the people they grew up with, and share with us all they know about radical Islam and its intentions for our world.  Yet feeble minded conspiracy theorists spit in their faces.  Please show your support for such brave Muslims by listening to their stories and taking their words with deep regard.

I manned checkpoints in the Israeli army, finishing just before the 2006 war with Hizbullah.  The Palestinians that I got to know in the West Bank occasionally confided in me that they are trapped in their world.  If they even speak out against the jihadists, they will be slaughtered.  They told me that their true wish is NOT their own state, but rather to move to Israel! to the West, to freedom!  But what can they do?  This is why you need to see the film.  To see the world that they are living in, which directly effects the rest of our globalized world.  The war we are in is far more complex than you can imagine.  Your greatest weapon is education.",1189987200,86,3250,4.8108108108108105
2887440,5,B000SM7QTI,"I bought this movie when it first came out and have had several public showings, and I've tried to encourage anyone who will listen to either see our copy or buy it themselves.  It was amazing to me how much difficulty I ran into trying to get it shown in a so-called 'public' theater here, when they show tons of schlock like Gore's lying movie or Michael Moore's version of reality.  But resistance to the truth has always plagued humanity, and is the real reason for war.

The funny thing is, the content in this film comes from the mouths of the perpetrators, not the producers.  There is real video copied from their own media, commentary by experts and first-hand accounts of involvement by the people who were (are) there, but no outside scripted rhetoric by someone with an ax to grind (unlike a couple of the reviews here so far).  It is fair and balanced, well thought out, and if anything more complimentary toward Islam than it should be.  If I needed to say anything negative it would be it is slanted too far towards politeness and giving the benefit of the doubt to Islam.

One of the many scenes that stood out for me in the film was the image of Neville Chamberlain from before the beginning of World War II standing in front of cameras and confidently declaring that he had Hitler's peaceful assurances on paper.  We all know how that turned out, don't we?  Reminds me of so many other people now who are burying their heads in the sand, liberals who shrink from doing anything difficult, talking about needing 'diplomatic' solutions and just sending more money (blackmail payments?).

It might be unfair to compare Islamic fascism with Hitler's version, and I might agree.  It would be unfair to Hitler, because the Islamic version is much more murderous and implacable.

There is no doubt that the groups caught on film here are bent on destruction of anything with which they don't agree.  The nice thing is they are condemned by their own words and actions, and no one has to manufacture anything.  All you've got to do is listen to them and you'll find out what the chances are of talking them out of their hatred.  The only thing they'll understand is more of Afghanistan and Iraq.

Sometimes with all the political fallout of the Iraq debacle we lose site of what is at stake in the war on terror. Because the country is so divided over President Bush's ability to manage the war, the very real and serious problem of Islamic terror is often relegated to a foolish unimportance. As my brother-in-law told me the other night, ""if Bush hadn't gone into Iraq we wouldn't be in this mess."" On Wednesday, March 14, the West Valley Jewish Community Center presented ""Obsession: Radical Islam's War against the West,"" sponsored by the West Hills Chabad. Like a clarion call this film reminds us of the clear and present danger that confronts Western Civilization . After the movie one of the primary speakers in the film, Noni Darwish discussed with the audience in detail her pro American/Israeli position to this war. This is a film that every American should see.

Darwish, the daughter of the Egyptian Fedayeen commander in Gaza during the 1950s, spoke about the madness that is gripping her people. You could not help but admire her courage and her recognition of righteousness against all odds. Ms. Darwish has a price on her head, so the security to get into this presentation was very strict. She doesn't waiver from her condemnation of the Arab world, her support for Israel or her love of democratic values. I have to admit, I was impressed. It's not every day that you meet an Arab national speak about her respect for the Jewish state. Perhaps reality is never far behind because as Ms. Darwish spoke you got the distinct impression that she was very alone in this commitment, disowned by her family, her country and the religion that totally dominated her life growing up.

Meeting and talking with a real live hero like Noni Darwish made the evening exciting but the film stands on its own merit as a glaring example of the utter hatred that much of the Arab world and large swaths of the rest of non Arab Islam feel toward the west. Thanks to Al-Jizeera and some other like minded Middle East media outlets there are mounds of written and video evidence to support the film's arguments.

The film argues that we are not taking this war seriously. Most of what is reported in the Arab world and in other places never seems to make it in the western media. Steven Emerson, a long time researcher of the Islamic threat said, ""The amount of hate propaganda is far more extensive and pervasive than the attention that it receives in the western media."" This has to stop. We need to begin to follow the Muslim press, listen to what they are saying, understand what they are implying with their statements and analyze more closely their intentions. The films ultimate message: We face disaster if we don't.

There is a violent movement to convert the entire world to Islam, to completely eliminate the Christian-Judeo world from the face of the Earth. Perceived western influences around the globe are targeted on a regular basis. Caroline Glick, a senior fellow at the Center for Security Policy, makes the point that many countries in the world today have a problem with Islamic extremism on some level. And then to emphasize that statement the film shows a map of the world covered in red ""X""s where Jihadis are on the rise, attacking, bombing and killing. As noted in one Palestinian children's textbook, ""this religion (Islam) will destroy all other religions through the Islamic Jihad fighters.""

Several of the speakers in the film kept reiterating the fact that the West is in denial of this problem. Even in a post 9-11 environment people do not want to admit that there is a growing malignancy on the planet bent on our destruction.

The film is very clear not to condemn Islam as a religion and therefore claims that not all of the world's Muslims are the enemy. But, it is clear that the Jihadi movement is at present very large and is growing with each passing generation. There are many Islamic leaders calling for the deaths of Jews, the destruction of the United States, and the defeat of the west, all the while being cheered on by thousands of onlookers. There is no shortage of hatred in the Islamic world. The film implores us to recognize this threat and to begin to fight back in order to survive.

Most disturbing about this enemy is the chair squirming, undeniable connection of the Islamic Jihad movement to the rise of Nazism in Europe during the 1930's. The two historical periods are so closely correlated that it is hard to comprehend how we could have missed its growth. It is as if we were so busy reminding ourselves in the last sixty years that we would never again forget the past in Europe that we did not see it creeping up on us again in another part of the world. The film shows that 19th and early 20th century European anti-Semitism  along with a remarkably similar ramp toward fascist ideology are alive and well and flourishing within the Muslim world. The only difference being in Europe it was based on politics and now it is based in religion.

One of the historical parallels to Nazism is the connection between the Mufti of Jerusalem and Adolph Hitler. As disturbing then as it is now the film describes and verifies that Hitler and the Mufti agreed that the extermination of the Jews was central to the War's aims. The Mufti, a radical fundamentalist in his own right, distinguished himself as one of the leaders who tried to prevent Jewish Zionism from establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine during that era. In exchange for his support Hitler promised him that would never happen.

In one especially chilling moment,  Walid Shoebat, a reformed Palestinian terrorist and, who like Noni Darwish is shunned by his family, community and religion, explains the growth of Jihad as compared to the growth of Nazism. He says that Islamo fascism is far more dangerous than Nazism because of its religious components. Jihad makes war in the name of almighty God while Nazism made war for a man, Adoph Hitler. And, it exists in several countries not just one. Therefore, Shoebat concludes, that if we do not stop its rise we will be facing not one Nazi Germany but several.

The sole of Islam is at stake some western commentators have noted, indicating that the only way we can win this is for Islam itself to struggle with the question internally and repair it internally. In other words, we are your supporters but it is you who have to correct the problem. According to ""Obsession,"" and confirmed by Noni Darwish, the struggle is already over, Islam has been stolen by the Jihadi movement. The enemy is getting stronger and the decent Muslim who wants to live his life like we live ours is growing ever weaker. In fact, one gets the sickening feeling that Noni Darwish, and the other Muslim commentators depicted in the film, which courageously stand against the Jihadi enterprise, are lone puppies in a sea of wolves.

The danger to all of us is clear. Either we begin to get serious about this problem and take positive steps to end it favorably or we are going to lose. The very existence of Western Civilization is at stake and all the freedoms that we developed, struggled with and refined over the last 2500 years are in danger of being forcibly replaced by something very different. We must recognize that to do nothing and to continue to live in denial of this growing problem is a huge mistake. Unless you are willing to accept that your grandchildren before the end of their lives will be bowing down to Mohammad five times a day I would suggest that you begin looking at our involvement in the Middle East as a matter of survival not as a political football to be argued as Republicans and Democrats. It is not too late but we need to begin now or face a global confrontation of such huge proportions that it will dwarf World War II by comparison. The choice is ours.",1189468800,121,7856,4.683333333333334
2887445,5,B000SM7QTI,"With the thwarted attacks in Germany this week, this documentary becomes even more timely and critical.  Perhaps only a few percent of Muslims actively support jihad against the West?  Possibly.  Yet, that is many millions of people that demand submission to their religious creed.  They are the ones who are actively recruiting, and converts get their particular take on the way of the Qu'ran.  This ""small minority"" are those who threaten or accomplish violence against their critics.  This ""small minority"" believes that death is a promotion, and that *your* death is a blessing.  They have no motivation to negotiate, as their value system has nothing in common with that of people who would ""discuss the situation.""

I'm looking forward to the commercial release of this important film.  I hope that they lose none of the impact of the pre-release version.
