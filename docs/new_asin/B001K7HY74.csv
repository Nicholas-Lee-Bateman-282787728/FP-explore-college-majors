3663435,4,B001K7HY74,"This was a fairly enjoyable and suspenseful series about a priest who is an exorcist.  Martin Shaw is superb as the priest.  The flaws include him saying that there are many ways to heaven.  Really, Father, is that what Jesus said?  In one episode, he takes part in a desecration of the mass in order to prevent a Muslim boy from killing a man, as if that makes it okay to hang the crucifix upside down and recite the exorcism ritual backwards to release a demon from hell.
At another point when quoting Scripture, he refers to Revelation as ""Revelations"", which is a common layperson's mistake.
Even though I enjoy shows of this type, I wish the writers would do their religious homework and get the details right.",1353801600,,715,4.5625
3663436,5,B001K7HY74,"First, let me say that I haven't viewed many BBC shows. I live in SoCal and am used to the local product. If their shows are written and performed this well then I have been missing out. The battles that take place in this ""Good vs. Evil"" show are believable for those of the faith.
  I am not Catholic, but, I have always admired their exorcists because I know that they face extreme evil and spiritual attacks on a level that would turn most men into shivering piles of Jello. Yet, I am dismayed by the recent attempts of the Catholic Church to denounce spiritual warfare and remove itself from the front lines of the battle in an attempt to remain politically correct.
  Still, this series tackles satanic evil, Godly love, Church corruption, human frailty, and brotherly compassion in a way that I have never seen expressed on the tube. The production value, writing and especially acting are superb! I plan to write an email to the producer of the show thanking him for such an outstanding effort. I will definitely add this DVD series to my collection!",1341532800,7,1058,4.611702127659575
3663437,5,B001K7HY74,The only downfall of this series is that it's only six episodes.  It's nice to watch a good vs evil and not have the evil be the Catholic church.  I wish there were more shows out there like this...TRULY enjoyed this.,1327881600,4,217,4.2682926829268295
3663438,4,B001K7HY74,"Intelligent, mostly well acted, but somewhat frustrating mini-series.

This story of a priest pulled into battle with the devil feels like it owes too much to 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' (among others) for the first episode or two, but then in increasingly develops it's own quirky, complex personality. I found myself ever more caught up, with richer, more morally complicated characters and situations than in most horror.

But then, it's let down by an ending less dramatic then what's been promised.

We've told this is literally going to be the birth of the anti-Christ, the unleashing of all the demons of hell, etc. The final war between good and evil.

Warning! SPOILERS AHEAD!!

So when it turns out to be just a plot on the Pope's life, I felt very confused and disappointed. It seemed almost as if there must have been a last episode or two missing.

Martin Shaw has a lot of strong moments as our hero Priest, even if a few moments are a bit theatrical. Indeed, you could say that for a lot of the acting. Fun, but a bit 'actory'

Overall I enjoyed it , I had just hoped for even more on both the visceral and thematic sides from the climax.",1312934400,,1155,4.524038461538462
3663439,5,B001K7HY74,"Whether the show was an intended one-off or was cancelled doesn't really matter.  I have heard that Marty Shaw only wanted to do one series and it has been my fervent wish that he (and Joe Ahearne) would revisit the character of Father Jacob.  That being said, I will back away from the pedantic kool-aid now.

Upon reading the synopsis, you may think that the story (certainly it's type) has been told ad nauseam, but this in my opinion, is one of the best.  It's highly entertaining and I found it to be thought provoking as well.  The changing view of the Catholic Church was tackled head on.

All in all, a wonderful show which completely engages you and makes you pull it out for multiple viewings.  Well worth the cost.",1310256000,20,725,4.488549618320611
3663440,5,B001K7HY74,"First of it Apparitions was not a miniseries it was a six-episode tv show that was cancelled due to the fact that the BBC put it on against a reality show on another BBC network.  The first season arc pits Martin Shaw's priest against different adversaries, some of whom are supposed to be on his side as he discovers a sinister plot against him.  Secondly, you don't need to be Catholic, religious or beleive in God to watch this show.  The stories are just as much about personal morals, ethics, and politics as they are about anything else.  Many of the characters in this show are more concerned with spin-doctoring and their personal political agendas than they are about protecting people and doing the right thing morally and ethically.  Church sends a nun to spy on him and report back to the Vatican on his doings, while at the same time they tell him to get on with doing the job he's supposed to be doing, finding saints to make the church look good, while at the same time being selective about who they think ought to become a saint. Had the show not been canccelled season two was going to continue the question--were there other clergy possessed by or otherwise being scontrolled by demonic elements.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apparitions/dp/B0048083KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apparitions</a>",1292630400,33,1353,5.159817351598173
3663441,5,B001K7HY74,"Apparitions is a mini-series that pits a Catholic priest against the forces of evil.  Martin Shaw does an outstanding job in the role of the priest who never compromises his principals in his battle to exercise the demons he encounters.
  When I saw that the main character in this show was a priest, I was ready for yet another bad portrayal of the Catholic Church.  It was refreshing to see that they did not take this path and actually showed a priest who remained committed to his beliefs.  The only ""bad"" portrayal was that of his superior, the bishop who seems more concerned about the Church being politically correct than actually combating evil.
  The series is very well written with stories that will keep you on the edge of your seats.  It is not however, suited for children.  If you are at all squeamish I would not watch this as some of the scenes are quite graphic.  For me, the stories were so compelling that I was able to overlook the violent scenes.  If you can get past that, I highly recommend this series.  I just wish that it was not just a mini-series but an on-going series.",1291680000,41,1100,4.5

8314317,5,B001K7HY74,"This is the best movie on exorcism I have seen. With the exceptions of a few ""Hollywood"" detours, the movie depicts the benefits and dangers of exorcism.

8314318,5,B001K7HY74,"I personally loved the show, but can understand why it didn't have better ratings. It basically couldn't win. Non-religious viewers would look at the show and say that it was nothing more than propaganda for the Catholic Church. Religious viewers would say that its theology and depiction of the inner workings of the Church were flawed or caricaturish. If you just watch it as a drama, without any preconceptions, it is an an excellent and suspenseful show.",1372982400,2,458,4.961038961038961
8314319,2,B001K7HY74,"When I saw that the six episodes of ""Apparitions"" were available for streaming, I browsed the user reviews here and on IMDb, and found them to be overwhelmingly glowing. And so, even before I had an opportunity to view the episodes myself, I drew them to the attention of a friend who is a fan, as am I, of Martin Shaw's work. I was surprised to learn from him, a few days later, that he had abandoned ""Apparitions"" after viewing the first episode. I understood why when I finally got around to viewing the series: I, too, wanted to quit after the first episode, but I stuck with it through three, after which I cut my losses and gave up.

Afterwards, I looked again at the glowing user reviews and tried to reconcile them to what I had seen. I could not. Especially puzzling is the opinion that the stories are ""thought-provoking."" Really? Consider the following exchange, taken verbatim (my comments in square brackets), from Episode 3.

**SPOILER ALERT**
Father Jacob (Martin Shaw), exorcist extraordinaire, is called to a prison to interview a convicted rapist named Cory who appears to be possessed by a woman. During the interview, Cory begins to sweat blood, a sure sign that demonic, or divine, powers are at work. (There's a fair amount of sweating and crying blood in the series-both by humans and by statues. But, hey, who among us hasn't encountered it?) Later, Cory is assaulted in the shower by a group of inmates. Afterwards, Father Jacob, the warden, and the prison priest discuss the possibly that Cory is possessed by a saint, and they speculate by which saint.
Warden: ""What about suspects? How many saints are there?""
Father Jacob: ""Ten thousand plus.""
Warden: ""Possession then. Any of them got form [a police record] on that?""
Father Jacob: ""We're on our own there. There are no documented cases of saintly possession.""
Warden: ""What about saints and rapists?""
Father Jacob: ""Maria Goretti is the patron saint of rape victims. She was murdered resisting a rape just over a hundred years ago.""
Warden: ""Was she a virgin?""
Father Jacob: [Nods] ""She was eleven.""
Warden: ""Should we dig up some background on her and Cory, and see if there are any other connections?""
Father Jacob: ""Cory was 20 when he was put behind bars. Maria Goretti's assailant, Alessandro Serenelli was also 20. Both gave their victims the same choice: lose your virginity or die. But Serenelli repented in prison. He attended Holy Communion with the victim's mother, and he went to her canonization. But Cory has never even admitted his guilt.""
Warden: ""Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. She takes over a guy who raped virgins; gets him raped [in prison] till he owns up.""
Prison priest: ""Does that sound like God? That is Satan making a mockery of everything we stand for!""
Father Jacob: ""But if it is Maria Goretti, perhaps she's trying to get him to reconcile with his victims.""

This scene cries out for Rod Serling, to step from the shadows, look into the camera, and address the audience. ""Three seemingly intelligent adults discuss the possibility that an 11-year-old rape victim, 100 years dead, has taken possession of a convicted rapist, to provoke his rape in prison, forcing him to reconcile with his victims. These three men do not yet recognize that they're no longer in Kansas, or anywhere else on Planet Earth. They're in... The Twilight Zone.""

On the positive side, production values are high; the settings are appropriately atmospheric; and the cast performs heroically in the face of some really bad dialogue. But none of this succeeds in elevating ""Apparitions"" above silliness.

There is a point when Cardinal Bukovak, who is trying to rein in Father Jacob, says of him: ""I'm not denying his charisma. Exorcists are full of it."" With his last point, the Cardinal has taken the words out of my mouth.",1370822400,4,3815,4.83614088820827
8314320,5,B001K7HY74,"I sat down to watch one episode and wound up watching the whole of this remarkable series. Not since The Exorcist has there been such a riveting good v. evil story.  Just as in The Exorcist, there's no guarantee that good will win.

As Father Jacob, Martin Shaw is patient and clever, as he outwits both the demons who inhabit otherwise average Brits and the Vatican hierarchy who refuses to believe demonic possession is real and is reeling from child abuse scandals.  The supporting cast is magnificent at portraying inner angst.

Perhaps the theology and storyline are a bit derviative, perhaps Martin Shaw is a bit one-note, but these are picks of the nittiest.  This is a fascinating series for fans of horror, thrillers and mysteries.",1368489600,4,740,4.841269841269841
