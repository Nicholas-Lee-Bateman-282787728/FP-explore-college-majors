8744829,4,B019D3J4VA,"This actually wasn't bad. The fight scenes were not great and the special effects and ""super powers"" were low low budget but what do you expect with these kind of movies? The costumes were revealing and the ladies in them attractive.",1462320000,5,233,4.7073170731707314
8744830,5,B019D3J4VA,"The Super Sexy Heroines of Metro City join forces to protect their city. Although these girls are so hot the crime rate will probably go up just from guys wanting to see them in their alluring costumes. Beautiful actresses, competent special effects & a real plot line make this title easy to recommend.

I swear 60 seconds can't pass in this film without an opportunity to gaze at one of these appealing heroines. All of the women due a fine job acting. They all handle their roles with real poise & look incredible while doing it. Especially Cosmic Girl played by Ashley Lane, able to be both sweet & strong effortlessly. I hope to see her in future projects. The brunette Supergirl (Mercedes Raquel)...I just hope to see anywhere.

Quite a few of these Superheroine themed movies have come out from Brookland Brothers these past couple of years. As far as I am concerned ""Agents of Power"" can be retconned right out of continuity while this new title ""Heroines of Fury"" is the crowning achievement. I hope future releases follow this style of tone. If you watched The Avengers & thought - Wow the only way this could be better is if it had gorgeous women in revealing costumes - Your wish has been granted. Definite purchase.",1460419200,7,1228,4.654377880184332
