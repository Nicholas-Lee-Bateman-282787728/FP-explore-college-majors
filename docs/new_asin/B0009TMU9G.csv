--it's not so much animated as still pictures with one graphic moving per scene.",1272672000,,357,3.8904109589041096
8066455,1,B0009TMU9G,I would like anyone who inquires about this to know what I wanted to know prior to buying it. This is a cartoon. It is a very badly made cartoon.. it is voiceovers with images from a book projected on the screen.. no animation. One of the stories is like the movie that halmark put out years ago but if that is what you are looking for.. donot buy this.,1197331200,,353,4.057142857142857
