8282412,5,B001B9Y4CE,"This title was originally released in 1992, but it in no way can be considered ""old"" material. Not only is the sound and video quality a lot higher than I expected, the information itself absolutely stands the test of time. In this video, Sammy Franco teaches the fundamentals of offensive techniques that can be safely, efficiently, and effectively employed in a street fight scenario. These techniques really are the bread and butter of any true student of reality based self defense.

Having viewed a number of Sammy Franco's more recently-produced DVDs, including those covering this same subject of basic offensive techniques (I only use the term ""basic"" in comparison to his more extreme innovations featured in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Widowmaker/dp/B001BEB8DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Widowmaker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Street-Fighting/dp/B001BEB7F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Street Fighting</a>&nbsp;programs) I found that I still derived a great deal of benefit seeing them portrayed in this format. Franco goes about teaching them differently, not in the sense that the specifics of the techniques are any different, but his approach has changed over time. It's like learning a very important lesson from two equally talented teachers, but who use different words to express it. You definitely retain a lot more as a result of seeing it presented that way.

Again, the video's translation into a digital format resulted in no loss of quality. It also contains an important refresher on the basic fighting stance, and an important section on footwork, which is vital to powerful and accurate offensive techniques. The end presents you with a good warm-up, stretching, and conditioning program with examples of the best exercises to perform to increase your power when performing the techniques. Overall, it's a thorough and complete title on offense that I'll definitely watch more than once. I highly recommend it.",1238630400,,2060,6.0756013745704465

8282415,5,B001B9Y4CE,"Those new to CFA or self-defense should strongly consider getting Panther Vintage CFA vol. 2.

Despite being ""vintage"" this DVD has excellent video and sound quality.

Vol. 2 covers, kicks, punches, the importance of a CFA fighting stance, warm-up exercises, basic weightlifting technique and how it applies to self-defense.

The format allowed me to get up and actually work on my own technique as Sammy Franco walked me through it. I appreciated the honest approach Sammy Franco had with the technique, without any condescension towards a novice, like me. The core principles taught in this film has given me a lot to practice.

Highly recommended. Now it's on to the next tape for me.",1238025600,,687,5.0
