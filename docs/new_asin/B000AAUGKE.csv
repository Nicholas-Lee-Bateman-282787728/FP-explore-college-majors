Griffitn uses 4 different time periods to examine humanity's religious hatred, persecution, bigotry, and basic intolerance. I really enjoyed both of these classic movies.",1223251200,,343,5.37037037037037
8077399,1,B000AAUGKE,"I own this double feature disk.  It will not play in four different dvd players that I tried.  I did get it to play in an old Toshiba laptop.  The sound and picture were great quality on the laptop, but other players I tried did not recognize the disk.  Could just be a bad disk.. I paid a buck for it at a grocery store a couple of years ago. Disk is supposed to play in Canada and US regions.  I'm not too dissapointed being out a dollar, but at the 45 dollar price tag here, I'd be wary.",1204070400,2,490,3.909090909090909
