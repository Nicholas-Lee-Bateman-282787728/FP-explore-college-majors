8283749,4,B000GETU3S,"Both movies are classics from Bobby deol's earlier/prime years. May not necessarily be everyone's cup of tea but undeniably in both movies he has given a praisable/unforgettable performance.  He fits the roles and executes them with perfection.  He is believable portraying a lonely soul and does not let the audience down.
Neither movie might have been a commercial success however will remain as classics down the memory lane.
The actress is pretty annoying in both, the music is pleasant, choreography is very strange and does not fit in. The story/plot is worth the praise.
If you like the main lead i.e Bobby Deol then you shall enjoy his screen presence if not then I don't suggest dropping your cup of tea.",1481328000,,713,4.884297520661157
