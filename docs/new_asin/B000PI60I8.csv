This is the much better (and in English) Myron Healey version.",1284508800,,76,4.846153846153846
8191766,1,B000PI60I8,"I ordered this used and wound up with another VHS copy of the hacked American version of Varan The Unbelievable. Do NOT buy this tape. Locate and buy the REAL, unedited JAPANESE LANGUAGE version of the film. The American version is just a train wreck, totally unwatchable. The Japanese version is a very good, if obscure, monster movie.",1248307200,2,336,4.810344827586207
