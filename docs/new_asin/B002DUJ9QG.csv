3913471,5,B002DUJ9QG,I ordered these a little late for my daughters christmas present.  The vendor was able to get them out in time so she could open them for Xmas.  She was very excited about getting all 6 seasons for Xmas.  The DVDs were of good quality and she has finished watching all of them.,1265932800,,277,4.188679245283019

8366133,5,B002DUJ9QG,"I finally received all 9 seasons, One through six were great, infact all seasons are great.  I couldn't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out, they finally did and I watched all of them.  I was dissapointed that there were going to be no more after the 9th season.  Maybe they can come up with more things to do with One Tree Hill.",1336953600,,338,4.090909090909091

8366136,5,B002DUJ9QG,One tree hill is about a bunch of kids and all there problems. The more you watch you will say that's what I felt like or that happend to me. So if you want to go back in time watch a little of this show and you will want them all. There is a lot of basketball in this but you don't have to like that to love the show. I hate basketball and love the show. Has very good luck with this seller and shipping was fast and price was great.....,1307750400,,438,3.7717391304347827

8366138,3,B002DUJ9QG,"okay well I'm a huge One Tree Hill fan and when the first two seasons came out my dad bought them for me, but I lost one of the disk and also got left behind from owning all the rest of the seasons so I came across this seller Roberto's Bazaar and saw a good deal, so choose to get it. So today my mother called me telling me my ordered had arrived and I came rushing home only to realize that the seasons aren't original there copys and my laptop doesn't even want to read it for the same reasons luckily since I already owned the first two season I was able to figure out they weren't real I mean it works on my dvd, but I wanted the original set not a copy and you can so tell just by looking at the box structure cause it's so silk and the colors are to bright, but whatever I'm happy i have the season just not happy there not original I would give this product a 50/50.",1302652800,,875,3.9213483146067416
