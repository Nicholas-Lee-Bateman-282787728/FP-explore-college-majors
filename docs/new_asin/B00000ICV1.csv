1221351,5,B00000ICV1,"I purchased this tape on the very first day of availability.  I had been anxiously awaiting its debut. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! Mein Gott!  Being a Rammstein fanatic I savored every single second of their appearance on this  video - but found myself craving more.  For all of you like-minded  Rammstein fans, this will have to slake our thirst until Motor's rendition  of a Live Rammstein Video (hopefully) due out in July of '99!",922838400,,431,4.756756756756757

1221353,5,B00000ICV1,It's awesome BABY!!!,921283200,,20,6.0
1221354,5,B00000ICV1,"To start off this Dvd does not have full sets by any of the bands. I knew this so I wasn't disapointed. Also note that this dvd is mainly revolving around Korn, seeing as Korn started this tour ,headlined it and was released by their label. Ok, so It really captures the vibe of the whole thing. I think it is an awesome dvd, there is some funny stuff on this also. The best performance was Korn, then Rammstein, then Ice Cube ,then Limp Bizkit. I was really excited to watch this and it was worth the money.",1307059200,,508,4.1938775510204085
1221355,4,B00000ICV1,"I purchased this for the Korn videos but found a few gems within this DVD... primarily Rammstein and Limp Bizkit.  However, be prepared for the shock of Rammstein!  Excellent music, however.  If you're a true Korn, heavy metal fan, it's worth the price.  Could have done without the Ice Cube but only b/c I'm not a rap fan.",1209686400,,323,4.517241379310345
1221356,4,B00000ICV1,"Great show with great performances. Only exception is on the german band that I do not recall the name. If it wasn't because of them, I should rate this DVD as 5 stars. That band does not add anything good to the show and merely because I do not think rock music match with german spoken language. But this is only my personnal opinion. Other might like. I am not the kind of rock fan that is interested on seeing bizarre things on the stage. I am more like into ""plug and play"" the music with no theatrical acting. That's sucks man, oh yeah. Anyway, that weird part of the show can be easily skipped and forgotten for ever. That's it.",1163376000,,635,4.256198347107438
1221357,4,B00000ICV1,"If your just buying this because you love Rammstein, it may disappoint you.  But I love the DVD even though I am not much into Ice Cube and Limp Bizkit.  Now Orgy and Korn is great! I love the behind the scenes and dressing room clips. It is sooo funny! I am not going to get into detail, just buy it! Rammstein lovers I recommend ""Lichtspielhaus"" and ""Live Aus Berlin"". I have them both and thier wonderful. Ich liebe rammstein!!!!!!!!",1144540800,2,436,4.4375
1221358,3,B00000ICV1,"This is one to rent. Rammstein's live performance was spectacular. It's hard to outshine them in that area. When Till whiped out his fake dick and hosed down the audience.... I hope that freaked some people out who'd never heard of the band. Crazy kinky psycho Germans. Good stuff.

Korn was good too. I loved the All in the Family performance. Definately worth seeing. If you like more than 2 or 3 of the bands, maybe you'd find it worth buying. Like previous reviewers said, there are better DVDs out there for each band. Rammstein fans should definately check out Live Aus Berlin.",1095379200,4,583,4.660194174757281
1221359,5,B00000ICV1,"First I should say im no fan of Ice Cube Or Limp Bizkit but i must give them credit for groups i dislike alot they did a damn good job on their performances. Orgys set was really good they should of had more time though they played both their hits (blue monday, Stiches) and did revival. I tip my hat to those guys. Rammstein well they were ummm really original with the whole fake ding dong and the fire but whatever. Korn took the cake they were the best doing ""Faget"" Blind"" ""A.D.I.D.A.S"" and others you all must buy this DVD",1076025600,2,528,4.237623762376238
1221360,3,B00000ICV1,"I borrowed this from a friend of mine, mainly because I wanted to see Rammstein, and I was somewhat happy with what I got, and somewhat not happy.  I'm no fan of Limp Bizkit, hip-hop's not my bag, and Korn had disappointed me enough allready, so what I got was a mixed bag.  I have no idea what lurks in the minds of the members of Rammstein (and I don't wanna know), but I am still a fan of theirs, and they played damn good live.  I fast forwarded through Limp's set and Ice Cube's, Orgy's set was ok, and Korn's was pretty good, I just wish they would have played more of their old material.  It's a pretty good concert/party video, but if you want the ultimate music home video, get any of Pantera's videos or their DVD.",1070582400,2,724,4.18705035971223
1221361,1,B00000ICV1,I bought this for the Rammstein scenes but theres not many. i do like the other bands but i expected more. If you want to see Rammstein live get (Live Aus Berlin) very good not a waste at all.,1060387200,,192,3.948717948717949
1221362,4,B00000ICV1,"With Ice cube being on here I was very IF'y about buying this, Im glad though I did now, there is still mroe than enough other stuff on here, even if you bypass the gangsta' rap! Deffinitly add it to your ROCK collection. This was the video that actually got be fully into rammstein! get their DVD, If you can get past the language barrier, then you will be hooked!",1051833600,,365,4.228571428571429
1221377,5,B00000ICV1,"It rocks, it rolls, it has interviews, backstage and dressing room footage, good music and good times.  There are kids all over the place, in the audience, on the stage watching their daddies jump, dance, wail and flail their bodies around.  It even has a birthday party with a brand new batmobile touring car,  but most important it has Korn, Rammstein, Ice Cube, Limp Bizkit and Orgy.  You should have both the VHS and DVD.

  Those Rammen Daddies from Berlin steal the show as they perform Buck Dich and Du Hast.  Quiet man Paul Landers sets the stage in this event and this time Rammstein doesn't get arrested!
  At first I was stunned when I saw him dance backstage to Orgy's 'Blue Monday', a most excellent song. But during Buck Dich, he bends toward the singer for the 'letzte kuss' as they say. Poor Flake, you've got competition! Paul doesn't stop here. During the clips of the afterparty he is seen eating styrofoam for the camera. Is this the same expressionless man who plays guitar when Rammstein performs? You go!

The Concert CD Soundtrack is excellent!  Get a copy.  Don't pass up the window of opportunity to get the DVD too so you won't miss an angle.  Its a good show.  All performers, well done!!!

 One WARNING you'll receive from me: For hard core fans only. A hard rock family hour most seriously.",1014854400,4,1320,4.5965665236051505
1221378,5,B00000ICV1,"I actually got to attend the last show of this tour on halloween, and it was so cool to see a clip from that show with everybody all dressed up.  The DVD gives a great essence of what it feels like to really be there, sans bruises and fractures. Anyway well worth the money for fans of the bands or fans of live music.",1001030400,,318,3.96875
1221379,3,B00000ICV1,"Family Values is a great video to own if you are a fan of any of the bands on the tour and just want to see live footage -- But if you want any really in-depth interviews, look elsewhere. For the most part, everyone performed well, and the performances kept my attention for the whole time. Here's how the band's did:
Limp Bizkit - Newcomers to the scene at the time, definetly the worst performance on the video. Fred walks too much like a duck during Counterfeit and his voice fades away all the time because he can't just stand still. Nothing against them or anything, but they did a really weak job. 2/5
Ice Cube - Probably the most interesting part of the tour. Ice Cube does the best he can with a rock crowd and wins over a few fans. One of the best moments on this video happens while Cube is performing ""F--- tha Police"" and it zooms in on some cop in the crowd with his arms crossed who looks like he's about to cry. It would have been nice to have seen Korn come out with him for ""F--- Dying"" instead of just sampling the guitar work. Still, a very very entertaining and energetic performance. 5/5
Orgy - Like Limp Bizkit, they were newcomers at the time and NO ONE was into their show. But they did a really good job performing and I liked the interlude they did before ""Stitches."" Really bad filming though on this part. 4/5
Rammstein - If you have the uncensored version, you know what this parts all about. Definetly quite a few moments to remember. When David talks about Rammstein being taken away by the cops, close your eyes. Trust me, it is very very gross. 4/5
Korn - Obviously the band that the whole crowd was there to see, and everyone obviously loved every minute of it. Lots of great backstage stuff, like the birthday party backstage, in between songs. Korn pull out some of their best songs, taking from all 3 (at the time) albums. The longest performance on the video, clocking in at about 45 minutes. Look closely during ""All in the Family"" and you can spot all the members of Incubus. 5/5
Overall, this is a great home video, and very fun to watch, but the filming was REALLY bad and the sound quality was horrible. More interviews with Ice Cube and Rammstein would have been appreciated. I suggest you buy this though, you really won't be disappointed.
(Just for the record: The reason why no Incubus performances were included on the home video is because they weren't officially on the tour. They came on for the last week or so to fill in for Ice Cube, who had to shoot ""Three Kings."" Just so you know.)",999734400,7,2538,4.379237288135593

1221381,5,B00000ICV1,"I wanted this disc enough to import it from the States. And I was not at  all disappointed - Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube and Korn were all amazing,  Rammstein were pretty good too. In fact the only downside was Orgy, whose  music just didn't fit at all. Easily five stars.",968457600,,266,4.28
1221382,5,B00000ICV1,I watch this movie every day i love it so much.  Great KoRn performance and great Limp performance. I recommend big time to buy this video it excites you when the bands are on stage and makes you laugh backstage.  Rammstien did a stupid thing on the tape i think it is funny.  Ice cube is  a good opening act but not a good main show.  Just a note!,963792000,,348,3.9855072463768115
1221383,4,B00000ICV1,"This dvd has oustanding footage from the greatest tour in history.  Behind the scenes shots and interviews with the bands.  For example, you'll see: -Nathan Davis's birthday party (Jonathon Davis's son) -Orgy dressing Korn up like themselves -Interviews with all the artists -A few women getting  ""more comfortable"" in Ramstein's dressing room, if you know what  I mean -And finally you'll see tons of songs performed live for the Family  Values crowd of 98'.
A small word of caution for the people youngsters  in the house, there are some shots of naked body parts so be careful when  ordering for your household.  I encourage everyone to purchase this dvd, it  really is worth every cent you pay.  And what better way to get it cheaper  here on Amazon than at the store...?  Order it now, you won't  regret it.",961632000,2,812,4.755395683453237

1221389,4,B00000ICV1,"The Family Values '98 DVD is basically the same video released on VHS last year.  You get 3 live performances from KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, Rammstein & Ice Cube, AND in the DVD edition, a photo gallery from the tour.  The  visual quality was obviously enhanced for DVD, which is good, but  remastering the sound for 5.1 surround would have been too much to ask  (though standard Dolby Surround is present).  Not the best hard rock/metal  DVD available, but is a worthy concert video for fans of late 90's trend  metal.",954892800,2,518,4.615384615384615

Korn was great!",949708800,2,273,3.857142857142857
1221393,5,B00000ICV1,"This was a GREAT video! I think you should Buy it.. The only think I dont't like about it is, Rammstein.. They did a VERY disturbing ACT in the video.. But I think this video ROCKS!",946425600,3,181,4.055555555555555
1221394,5,B00000ICV1,"Lots of camera angles, interviews, and shows what goes on before and after the performances. Korn just rocked (the main reason why I bought it). I  just wish ""Shot Liver Medley"" was there, but wasn't included for  some odd reason. Discretion is definitely advised (I don't kare how old you  are), because Rammstein's performance just made me sick (awesome song  though!).",940896000,,371,5.032786885245901
1221395,4,B00000ICV1,"This video was pretty cool. The KoRn performances were the best, and the Rammstein performance was quite disturbing. I didn't think Limp was that good simply because Fred doesnt get into the performance enough and his  voice can get annoying. I don't like Orgy much but Ice Cube was ok. I  recomend you buy this. I also recomend you buy ""Who Then Now?"" if  you haven't already bought it.",940291200,,387,4.579710144927536
1221396,4,B00000ICV1,"I really enjoyed the movie, i seen Korn, orgy and incubus in concert, wasn't part of the family values tour, but its nice to see how it is, cause when your in the crowd you don't get a chance to see all, especially when  your getting kicked and stuff.  Too bad they couldn't get a couple incubus  songs on there.  They coulda competed with the rest you know, and it might  if boosted their sales also.  The only thing that bugged me was the second  rammstein song, which was totally gross  All in all i think it is a very  good video for all u metal heads.",934243200,,556,4.121495327102804

The only group with any measure of talent are the titans of Neue Deutsche Hrte, Rammstein, and I promise, this isn't their best performance by a longshot. I would strongly recommend looking into the Live Aus Berlin, Lichtspielhaus, and Vlkerball DVDs, or wait for their Madison and Bercy performances to hit the shelves later this year.",1423699200,,425,4.835616438356165

I always wished there was more Rammstein on here (only 2 songs), but otherwise a cool concert!  If you had the VHS before, get this DVD!  Great price & collector's item.",1386028800,,272,4.1923076923076925

7910302,4,B00000ICV1,"The Family Values 98 package tour included Orgy, a now defunct as far as i know and largely forgotten ""Nu metal"" band, Limp Bizkit, Who many of us wish we could forget we were into, Ice Cube, it was the time of rap/metal, Korn and Rammstein, The most enduring act of the 5. I don't remeber any others if there were any. The DVD is largely concert footage interspersed with interviews and backstage footage. the Orgy and Ice Cube segments were watchable but not overly impressive. The Limp Bizkit songs are alright, although all the members of the band look cool with their metal weirdo outfits except durst sticking out with his signature frat boy trying to be hip hop look. The Korn Songs are good, including a performance in halloween costumes of all in the family featuring limp bizkit battling verses with Korn. What i really bought this DVD for was the Rammstein Footage.

 The Family Values Tour 98 DVD Also has a short 2 song Rammstein concert footage section with the infamous fake wang on Buch Dich and short interview with Flake as well as some backstage antics featuring Tiel giving a european style smooch to a member of orgy and a very cool looking Till and Chris ""Doom"" Schnieder trashing the backstage area and leaving with an authoritative ""Party Over"" when some female groupies go into a fake lesbian shtick to the delight of the more easily impressed members of other bands. This dvd does feature nudity of both the real and prosthetic varieties.",1366502400,,1464,4.692607003891051
7910303,3,B00000ICV1,rammstein is nasty in this movie. if you have young kids i suggest you don't let them buy/watch this because its very vulgar. i like the other bands like limpbizkit and orgy. the cd to this (sold seperately) is pretty awesome too. in my opinion rammsteins stage show ruined the film.,1356912000,,283,4.568627450980392
7910304,5,B00000ICV1,"Yep. A VHS Tape. They still do exist! I only bought this item for Rammstein and they were amazing. As for the others, I didn't really care much for, but I did like Orgy's Blue Monday.",1348531200,,183,4.111111111111111
7910305,4,B00000ICV1,"I first watched this in fall of '98 on MTV and recorded it on VHS. I was a huge Korn fan at the time and thus began my love for concerts and dvd concerts. FAMILY VALUES '98 is a great dvd if you're into old school Korn and Limp Bizkit. This is when both bands were still heavy and just starting to get lots of play on MTV which unfortunately led to them making crap music.  I'm not into Ice Cube much but he does sing ""Children Of The Korn"" with John Davis plus some other rap songs which I skip through.  Orgy and Rammstein are also on here but I skip through them also  I'd give this dvd a 5/5 BUT the song ""Shot Liver Medley"" by Korn is not on here.  It was on my old MTV Family Values VHS tape.  It's also on the FAMILY VALUES '98 CD. It's the best song Korn plays live IMHO.  I'd like more of Korn and Limp Bizkit and less of those other bands.
