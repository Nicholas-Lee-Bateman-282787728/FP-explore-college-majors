4444443,5,B004PHSTZ2,"This is a 3 part series, of course there are Lemurs and Chameleons, the most prolific of Madagascar's fauns.
But there is also interesting birds, insects, a tortoise, and a curious blind fish that swims upside down!
Filmed is stark reality blu-ray and narrated off camera by David Attenborough (he does appear briefly at the very beginning and end) it is a great addition to any nature/bbc collection.
The extras are also worth watching, interesting is The Giant Egg, which chronicles Attenboroughs now 50 year old excursion to the island with vintage film clips and newer ones too.",1307923200,23,582,4.948979591836735
4444444,4,B004PHSTZ2,"Isolated from the African mainland and marked by extraordinary geographical variation and seasonal extremes, Madagascar has been the stage for a unique evolutionary direction for its plant and animal life. Far from adaptation dead ends, these organisms have found ways to endure the most hostile environments. In the event of a global catastrophe, this unique island will suffer its share, but the great variety of life and their methods of survival would have little difficulty in recovering. A spine of mountains runs the length of Madagascar's north-south axis, splitting it in two for both climate and animal populations. The moist air and monsoon rains bathe the lush tropical forests of the east, while the west is shielded from water for the most part, a land of dry groves of thousand-year old baobab trees. The southern aspect of the island is an alien world of salt, and dry, gnarled woodlands. The center of the island is a plateau of rock plagued by earthquakes, rending the surface with cracks and valleys; the center is occupied by a lake born of this upheaval. The Western edge is a series of limestone reefs, resembling an ancient skeletal leviathan. Each habitat is rife with extraordinary species; more than 80% are found nowhere else on Earth.

When Pangaea broke apart 90 million years ago during the late Cretaceous period, Madagascar chipped off the Indian subcontinent and sat astride Africa's east coast, the world's oldest island. At some point in its history, plants and animals were swept across the ocean onto the land, for the most part remaining isolated from the rest of the African continent since. Some of the inhabitants are similar to animals found elsewhere, but genetic drift has crafted something other entirely. Extreme forms of life have come to being here. There are eighty different species of lemur, primates that live nowhere else. Half the world's chameleon species can be found here, with brilliant coloration that matches any tropical bird. The giraffe necked weevil can be found here, an odd insect whose neck takes up over half its body length. Reed lemurs spend their entire lives on mats of reeds in a lake. Sifaka lemurs dine heartily on Euphorbia cacti, which are filled with a milky poisonous fluid that burns human flesh upon touch; they are able to leap at speed upon cacti without impaling themselves upon the dangerous spines. The elusive Fossa, a distant relative of the mongoose, is the largest predator, and hunts the lemur. Underground rivers are filled with ancient fish unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Radiated tortoises live in scrub brush, living as long as 180 years. A vast salt lake oversees a spiny forest of arid extremes. The variation in landscape and the effect it has on the climate are why this island has among the greatest diversity of any place on Earth.

The impeccable photography captures a strange world unlike anything you have seen before, with intimate images , but with a distanced sensibility. Attenborough manages to reveal Madagascar as hostile, yet deeply intriguing, and from a wildlife perspective a coveted destination. Environmental degradation has taken its toll on the whole of the island, fragmenting habitats for farmland and charcoal production. Deforestation has succeeded in eroding what viable farmland there is. The rural Malagasy population is amongst the poorest in the world, and such poverty serves to further degrade the land with badly planned efforts to feed the people. In the recent past, Madagascar's government had taken greater steps toward conservation; land had been set aside for parks to drive ecotourism, with half of set fees returning to local populations to incentivize conservation. With the coup that chased President Ravalomanana into exile, the park system and conservation efforts have collapsed, allowing gangs to sack the forests for lumber and endangered species for pets. Of course, the outgoing President was well on his way to reversing his own work, attempting to sell half his nation to Daewoo for export-only crop production. Protected rosewood rainforest was cut to the ground, sold to China, making more cheap crap for Americans and Europeans to buy. All of this serves organized crime traffickers, leaving the domestic population worse off than before. This has served to convince, to some extent, the Malagasy people that it behooves them to protect the biodiversity as a valuable investment, rather than selling it off to soulless foreigners.

Madagascar gets across all too well the importance of the natural habitats here. Elephant birds, at 3 meters in height, were the tallest birds that ever lived. They once lorded over the southern beaches, until they met the first explorers to reach Madagascar. Now all that remains of them are eggshell fragments on a southern beach. This story has repeated itself since across the whole of this fragile nation, erasing forever innumerable plants and animals that fought for survival. Conservationists and the local population have a renewed passion to create a more sustainable model, and the most important agents are the people of Madagascar. Understanding of this land has only just begun, and such learning is more than academic. The Rosy Periwinkle, found only in Madagascar, is the source of a chemotherapy agent used for Hodgkin's lymphoma and pediatric leukemias. The struggle to preserve Madagascar is the same as that all over the world - it is to preserve ourselves.",1307750400,9,5477,5.1447811447811445
4444445,5,B004PHSTZ2,"What is it with the US DVD marketing and their bull! 1st they substitute OPRAH for the GREAT ATTENBOROUGH in the Nature show LIFE. Now they are going to release a shortened verson of Madagascar. Sorry, i will not purchase the short version.",1306540800,13,240,4.604651162790698
4444446,5,B004PHSTZ2,"A few BBC wildlife programs are average but the majority are good, very good or exceptionally good. In my opinion ""Madagascar"" is in the highest category. The series was eighteen months in the making with some difficult and dangerous moments for the cameramen, including a platform high in the trees to film red ruffed lemurs, and the hair-raising nocturnal filming of fossas in the final show. The programs cover both the beautiful and the bizarre, including shell squatting spiders, pygmy chameleons little bigger than ants, Labord's chameleon that lives for only 12 weeks, fish that swim upside-down, giraffe-necked weevils, and lemurs that eat bamboo containing levels of cyanide that would be lethal for other animals. A big plus is that in addition to the fauna and flora we have stunning aerial photography of the varied and spectacular landscapes of the island - mountains, rainforests, rivers, coasts and arid areas.

David Attenborough (as good as ever) provides the narrative, explaining how plants and animals adapted to the environment during the 60 million years the island was cut off from the rest of the world. As for the music, all too often BBC programmes are spoiled for me by excessively loud and inappropriate music. In this case the music, much of it composed specially for the series, actually adds value to it. If I was allowed to keep only one wildlife series I think ""Madagascar"" might be it even though it does not feature my favourite animals - the big cats.

However, along with the beauty there is a sombre tone. We see the scattered remains of the elephant bird that began to disappear when man arrived. David Attenborough tells us that the unique radiated tortoises are likely to be extinct within twenty years, that only ten female fossas survive in the southern forest, and only 200 ghost-like silky safakas remain. He finishes all three programs with a warning about impending extinctions. How sad it would be if our great-grandchildren were one day to watch this wonderful series to see not living animals but a record of those that have vanished from the earth.",1299801600,112,2099,4.9602272727272725

Yes, there are a lot of lemurs in this program, but this is the only place in the world where lemurs live.  To see them in real life, up close and personal as I did, was amazing.

4444506,5,B004PHSTZ2,"What an extraordinary film.  BBC/Earth has done it again by showcasing this Lost World, a biological hotspot: Madagascar.  Millions of years ago the island split off from Africa and India and since that time has been evolving on own, for the most part, isolated from the world.  The result of all this isolation is a land of incredible biodiversity with plants and animals that are unique to Madagascar.  Basically the island is divided roughly Into two distinct regions by a rugged mountain range running, more or less, north to south.  The land east of these mountains is predominantly rain forest and to the west, in the rain-shadow, the land is dry for most of the year but, on each side, there are variations of climate.  The footage of these mountains is stunning, with vistas of sheer cliffs and eroded mesas.  With all this variation in habitat the variety of plant and animal life is something to behold.  And, guided by host David Attenborough, behold it you will in this fine nature film.  Madagascar's ""flagship mammal"" is, of course, the lemur: at just over 100 species this primate is predominate over most of the island and every species is threatened or endangered.  Additionally, each species is unique to a particular habitat, region and behavior.  Some are able to eat plants that are filled with toxic chemicals,like Cyanide.  Others have found a way to eat tiny leaves that are protected by needle like spines.  One species of lemur lives on the razor sharp ramparts of a fossil reef's eroded cliffs, another makes their home in the reed beds of just one lake and live their whole lives over water.  So, is there a lot lemur footage?  Yes, but why this is a problem with some reviewers is beyond me.  Besides lemurs the series boasts extended sequences of many other animals; a family of Striped Tenrecs, many kinds of chameleons and frogs, numerous kinds of birds and of course the insects.  Memorable scenes of a Dwarf Chameleon in the same frame as a black ant and the ant is not much smaller than the reptile.  The list goes on, but you get the idea.  This series is well up to BBC's standard and Attenborough's narration is right-on.  Look for all kinds of unique trees and palms that often form the base of the food chain.  One mammal deserves special mention: the Fossa, a cat-like predator that prays on lemurs and may be related to the Civet.  This elusive carnivore created it's own filming problem but what little footage they got was well worth it.  Along with the series, this two disk set includes some special features on filming issues and other aspects of Madagascar life, both past and present.  All in all, this series is assured an honored place in my nature film collection and I hope in yours too.

4444513,5,B004PHSTZ2,"""Madagascar"" is a mini-series co-produced by Animal Planet and the BBC. It gives us a unique peek into the flora and fauna of Madagascar, the large island-nation off the African coast. The creatures at Madagascar have evolved in isolation from the rest of the world for millions of years, and many of the species can't be found anywhere else.

The most iconic animals on the island are, of course, the lemurs. Brace yourself for a lot of those! The ring-tailed lemur is something of a generalist, and can even be found living on mountains, while other species are extremely specialized. The bamboo lemurs live almost exclusively on bamboo, which they somehow manage to digest, despite high levels of cyanide in this particular plant. The lemurs known as indris look eerily human-like as they jump from tree to tree in near-upright position. I also noted, with some childish satisfaction, that many of the lemur species look like cuddly toys!

Other more or less weird creatures featured in ""Madagascar"" include a fish that swims upside down, a turtle that can become almost 200 years old, beetles which use their long necks to fight, insect-devouring plants and a small lemur that acts as a pollinator of flowers. We also get to meet the world's ugliest parrot, the Greater Vasa Parrot. Looks like a vulture!

The only problem with this documentary is that it shows no humans, as if Madagascar was some kind of pristine Eden. Or is it Lemuria? In reality, the island-nation has a population of 22 million people!

That being said, I must nevertheless say that ""Madagascar"" is one of the more interesting and well-produced wildlife documentaries I've seen for a long time. Five stars!",1374019200,2,1683,4.915492957746479
4444514,4,B004PHSTZ2,"Don't get me wrong it's a great brief series about the island but I don't find lemurs that interesting and this has a LOT of them. Some chameleon stuff, a bit about those interesting trees and something called a ""fasi"", a very ugly dog like creature as well as some other exclusive species living and extinct like the Elephant Bird. The whole final episode was about the host's personal times in Madagascar centering around his curiosity about the long extinct Elephant Bird so you really only get about 3 hours of island wide creature vignettes, which is Lemur and Chameleon heavy with other species lightly mixed in. This also has mostly land animals, not a lot of ocean/fresh water species and not a bunch about native plants either. Madagascar has none of the majestic, and more attractive animals, that Africa and other places have. It's worth a watch but I don't know that I'd pay full price for this series UNLESS you are fascinated by Lemurs!! Go for Africa, Planet Earth, Blue Planet or Life over this and you won't miss much.",1371340800,4,1035,4.6923076923076925

Great drama and beauty from a unique place on earth, hosted by, one of the most qualified narrators to bring us these types of nature programs. Presenting the immense beauty of our planet, with a realistic look at what we humans are doing to our planet to destroy the diversity of the planet, while showing the good, that some are undertaking to protect it.

4444520,2,B004PHSTZ2,"This show was a great disappointment to my husband and I.  We love watching wildlife documentaries, especially ones with ""weird"" and unusual wildlife in them.  We were expecting Madagascar to be just our thing - afterall, isn't Madagascar supposed to be full of wonderful and, sometimes weird, creatures?  Apparently not, according to this documentary.  We were left feeling that Madagascar was a somewhat empty place, mostly populated by lemurs!

For every one animal that is not a lemur, there was at least two lemurs shown.  Very unbalanced.  My husband and I found it tedious.  The whole documentary seemed disorganized with them going back and forwards from subject to subject with no logic to anything really.  There were far too many overhead shots of the island and a lot of information was repeated so much that my husband and I began to feel insulted.

It was such a shame - for every weird creature that was featured, there was barely any attention given to any of them.  We were fascinated by some of the animals shown, and very unhappy when they seemed to hurry past those animals to tell us more about the lemurs!  Ugh.

Would not recommend.",1367280000,9,1155,4.802030456852792

However, I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a little more to this expensive dvd. It is about 95% about lemurs and little else. From the length of this production there is disappointment that the content couldn't have been a little more diverse. Are we to conclude that there is nothing of interest in Madagascar than its geography and its lemurs?",1358208000,4,512,4.764044943820225

4444533,5,B004PHSTZ2,"BBC'S documentary Madagascar is absolutely amazing. I cannot really say it is better or worse than the other nature documentaries in the BBC series as they tend to be very good. This one is certainly up to standard.

  David Attenborough narrates as he often does and as usual is very educational and anecdotal. He explains quickly on in the series that the story of Madagascar is more than anything the story of Lemurs, a type of about 100 primates endemic to the island. They have evolved there for over 60 million years, isolated from the rest of the world and are unique in ways that epitomize the adjective.

  Some Lemurs seem to dance as they run. Others live their entire lives in reeds on the shore of a single lake. A few of them are nearly the size of a human being and one is the smallest primate in the world. All of them are fascinating and require no humanizing, each seeming to share many characteristics with their globe-covering, pollution-generating relatives. Sadly, many of them are also in serious danger of not having any more birthdays.

  More than usual, Attenborough teaches the watcher how Madagascar is a good place to study man's impact on wildlife. It is a place that remained untouched by man for longer than most and which held on to its animals and environment longer than often is the case. In addition the very good cinematography and narration, the bonus features aren't bad either. One is a special where the narrator looks for clues about what happened to a giant Madagascan bird that measured twelve to sixteen feet tall but which has been long extinct. The other is a story about a woman who spent a week or so hanging out with Lemurs at a nature escape. Both are very nice. All around, this production is educational, fun and as with most BBC productions, reminds us why we should do everything we can to protect what is left of our wild places in the world.",1342828800,2,1900,4.597633136094674
4444534,5,B004PHSTZ2,"It's amazing, the video it great, narrating is great!  Surprising that it came in one piece, that the only thing I'm always worried about when I order movies from amazon",1326931200,,169,4.633333333333334
4444535,5,B004PHSTZ2,"The photography on this dvd is fabulous. I learnt so much about the natural history of this island, the commentary is so well done, and i wish i had bought an extra copy for myself!",1326844800,,181,4.2
4444536,5,B004PHSTZ2,"Although Madagascar did not have the complexity of other BBC Planet productions since it is limited to a smaller area of 100 miles, regardless, BBC has captured incredible shots just like the rest of the Planet collection. I think it's critical for human creation to accept the responsibility not to disturb the animals we encounter, and to encourage everyone to respect and protect the natural world. What a privilege it is to see wild animals undisturbed in their natural environments and no one accomplishes that like the crew of BBC and the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough... I wish David lots of health since he truly is indispensable... No better way of watching a nature documentary than having David as the narrator with his own unique accent and personality. Simply Bravo.

Unfortunately, David adds another invention to previous ones, he shows up on the screen & gives his ideas about evolution. Undoubtedly, good commentator, but should just stick to what he sees & keep his delusions to himself & please stay out of screen, We are willing to pay more if they cut out images with him & his pro-darwinistic commentaries.",1325376000,17,723,4.484848484848484

It's also a good video for families, especially if you are tired of seeing another zebra getting taken down by a crocodile and that sort of thing. Although there are a couple predators in this video, the stars of the show tend to be cute and cuddly, or at least harmless. We really liked it a lot.

4444540,5,B004PHSTZ2,"Sir David Attenborough's nature presentations are simply the gold standard of the genre.  He himself is a treasure as are the creatures he profiles. This DVD set takes us to the magical island of Madagascar.  We see a panoply of curious sights and sounds including several species of Lemur. These critters are guaranteed to melt even the hardest of hearts with their beautiful faces and mischievious chicanery. Also present are a great variety of chameleon - a smallish member of the lizard family, I believe, who are also quite winsome but in a different way.

In several spots I found myself wishing for less musical accompaniment. The music, as it is, is suitable in style but I prefer to hear the natural ""music"" of the surroundings: the crunch of leaves under a lizard's foot, the wind in the trees, the rain, the animal calls  ...& so forth. These are still present with the music overlaid, but I prefer only the natural sounds alone.
Aside from this, I have no complaints and can give this set my highest recommendation.",1320019200,6,1027,4.752808988764045

Not to be confused with the funny cartoon animal  personalites of the human voice actors in the cartoon movie Madagascar, the real-life animal personalities in the documentary show their surviving habits and noise-making voices, where jerking arm and leg movements to stay alert at all times are common for many types of ground and tree-living animals.

Some of the best scenes are: (spoiler alert) the pitcher plant, sifakas, and the white paradise-flycatcher. Because of this video, I want to go to madagascar.

Two complaints: A. There aren't enough episodes. and B. The Ring-tailed Lemur is featured way too much. i mean, they're cute, and cool, but they should show them once and then show other, different lemurs.

4444545,5,B004PHSTZ2,"Judge Russell Engebretson, DVD Verdict -- ""This BBC-produced wildlife documentary, narrated by David Attenborough, was filmed over a period of eighteen months. Spanning only three one-hour episodes, Madagascar is far more modest than the epic Earth series, but still delights. Two episodes, ""Island of Marvels"" and ""Lost Worlds"" are on Disc One. Disc Two includes the third episode, ""Land of Heat and Dust,"" and a pair of extra features -- ""Attenborough and the Giant Egg,"" in HD, and ""Lemurs of Madagascar,"" in standard definition. Each episode explores a different area of Madagascar. Lemurs are the stars of the show, found all over the island--from the desiccated south to the tropical coasts, and the mountains between. In one area, golden bamboo lemurs subsist on a diet of cyanide-laced bamboo leaves; other lemurs cross razor-like mountaintops to reach precious pools of water; while another species deftly navigates through a forest of thorn-covered trees. Although a fertile area for wildlife photography, Madagascar is evidently a tough environment in which to film. Ten-minute clips at the end of each episode document the camera crew's difficulty in capturing images of these elusive animals without frightening them away, and the horrendous days-long rainfalls that brought production to a halt until the weather cleared. After seeing the conditions they faced, my respect for the camera crew's tenacity ratcheted up several notches. The 1.78:1 1080i image is good with a few notable exceptions. Many of the wide aerial shots of forests and mountains are blurred in the foreground, and some other shots--especially of rushing streams and rivers surrounded by forest--are soft and much less detailed than they should have been, appearing closer to DVD quality, almost as though they had been lifted from a standard-definition video. In spite of what I've read elsewhere, I did not see any evidence of obvious banding, or any majorly noticeable artifacts beyond the softness I mentioned. This is not a reference-quality video, but it easily outshines a DVD. My biggest disappointment is with the audio. Why Dolby Digital stereo? There is plenty of room on a 50GB Blu-ray disc for an LPCM or DTS-HD MA audio track--in stereo and surround. Though, I'll admit, the sound is very good for Dolby.""",1310515200,19,2304,5.263586956521739

Pros:
- Typical Attenborough narration quality:  Genuine interest reflected in his intonation.
- Videography is high definition and well-stabilized.  The bitrate stands up very well on an upscaling 4K blu ray player, and it looks utterly amazing when I turn on the increased frame rate feature (LG TruMotion) on my TV.
- A terrific mixture of sweeping scenic videography and closeup shots.
- Sounds effects are realistic and add quality to the video.  The background music is also beneficial, fitting, and unique to this series.
-  Like BBC's Life or Planet Earth, this 3-part series covers a variety of wildlife on Madagascar--plants, insects, birds, mammals, and geography.
