1263655,5,B00003CXEJ,"With his stunning new vision of the most revered of Shakespeare's plays,  director Michael Almereyda has effectively transposed many of the enduring  themes of that classic work to our contemporary hi-tech era. Even if you  are not very familiar with Shakespeare's plays or have always been  confounded by his verse, one can still appreciate this film for the  tremendously inventive ways by which Almereyda has interpreted the core  scenes of Hamlet in the context of corporate America. His visually striking  translation of scenes like Ophelia's drowning and Hamlet's famous ""to be or  not to be"" soliloquy are a delight and true brain candy. The cast is all  around superb, with the classically delivered lines from actors Liev  Schreiber (Laertes) and Sam Shepard (Ghost) nicely counterbalancing the  very contemporary style of delivery from Ethan Hawk (Hamlet), Bill Murray  (Polonius), and Julia Stiles (Ophelia).
There will no doubt be much  comparison between this film and Baz Luhrmann's flashy modern remake of  Romeo and Juliet. However, whereas Luhrmann's film ultimately fails in  going beyond the boundaries of its visually striking presentation,  Almereyda's Hamlet proves to be far more than a mere spectacle for the  senses. In fact, this is the serious flaw that plagues most of the films  coming from young, talented independent filmmakers these days: all style,  no substance. Well, this Hamlet has both. By setting the film deep in the  heart of a very real and very modern steel and concrete American jungle  like New York City, which is infused with the relics of the mass media and  cold capitalistic consumerism, Almereyda powerfully enhances for the  audience the sense of the desolation of his characters that results from  urban isolation. This is a theme that Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai has  so masterfully examined with his films Fallen Angels and Chungking Express.  In Hamlet, we get a powerful dose of both Kar-Wai's visual flair and the  sensitive, crumbling heart that it sheathes.",958348800,27,2021,5.214953271028038
1263725,5,B00003CXEJ,Ethan Hawke is brilliant and shows range and subelty of emotion that Brannaugh cannot match. Sam Shepard plays King Hamlet like he's never been played before beaten down by the experience of hell.

I use this with my high school students and it holds their interest well enough.  It feels a bit dated now as a ""modern"" adaption (he has a modem, a big landline phone etc.) but overall it's okay.

1263727,1,B00003CXEJ,"While this rendition of Hamlet does a good job of giving us more Ophelia, it completely omits a lot of the more important aspects of Shakespeare's work.  I'm all for messing around with the classics, but this re-make really trashes Shakespeare's idea with such things as product placement, and omitting certain elements that we all look forward to seeing when we watch a production of Hamlet.  ""Alas Poor Yorick, I knew him Horatio..."" the image of a Shakespearean actor holding skull is the cover for many renditions of Hamlet, and is almost the international symbol for Shakespeare.  You won't find it in this version.  Act 5 scene 1 is missing from the play.  The finale sucks.  I won't ruin it for you, but the original work comes to a climax in the end, where all of Claudius's plotting and manipulation comes to light, and his treachery is turned against him.  It's the whole business of reaping what you sow.  In this version, the ending is castrated.  Shakespeare's Hamlet fits into the category of ""Tragedy.""  Part of the reason why is because the characters all start out in order, and the ending is disarray and chaos.  This version of Hamlet qualifies as a tragedy in that the original masterpiece itself ends in disarray and chaos, and the thing we mourn the most is not the death of any character, but the way that Michael Almereyda kills the entire play.",1462060800,3,1369,4.7100840336134455

It's so funny, it takes place in NYC in the year 2000, while the set design is simply timeless and modern, the technology is of course dated. Ethan Hawke, he's an amazing actor, I love all of his movies. I must assume that Ethan and his agent are very selective with what with witch Project agrees to take on. This is one an actor who has had a stellar career, all of his movies are just amazing! The acting, directing, casting, and set design are impeccable.

Poor poor Hamlet, he had Great burden to bear. His is grief is unmatched. It's almost as if his mother and uncle we're taunting him over his grief. There is so much pain, sadness, and anger that has built up through the play, that it comes out in an explosive conclusion. Almost everybody dies.

1263812,5,B00003CXEJ,"I used to be a purist.  I thought modern adaptations of Shakespeare were blas&eacute;.  Who wants to see Leonardo Dicaprio playing Romeo?  However, when I studied Shakespeare, I realized this is exactly what Shakespeare did; he took old plays and set them in periods to which his audience could relate.  With that attitude and an open mind, I've embraced modernized versions of Shakespeare's plays as movies

So-called purists are going to hate this movie, but if you're going to subject young people to Hamlet, I think this version is one of the better ones.  The performances are delivered in a way that makes the story easier to understand.  Many of Hamlet's monologues are delivered as video blog entries in this movie, which is a pretty smart way to make Hamlet's brooding seem more realistic.  In the older versions of Hamlet, he seems to wander around the castle talking to himself, which makes it hard to relate to the story because who does that?

If you enjoy Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus and Patrick Stewart's Macbeth because the modern settings add to the story, I think you'll like this version of Hamlet, and you'll probably also enjoy James Earl Jones as King Lear on the Broadway Theatre Archive DVD.",1395014400,,1213,4.849514563106796

1263819,5,B00003CXEJ,"I avoided this Hamlet for many years feeling sure there was no way I could fail to hate it. It was a 110 minute Hamlet with actors largely recognizable from light fare (Scream, Ten Things I Hate About You, Sex and the City etc). Worse, it brought to mind the kind of self-consciously hip and irreverent productions as Baz Luhrman's abortive Romeo + Juliet. I have rarely been so pleased to be so wrong. Here, Michael Almereyda gives us one of the richest and most thoughtful films of Hamlet ever realized.
  Much of the credit belongs to Almereyda himself. To begin with the issue that immediately seized my attention, as it must have many others, is the cutting of the text. This is, of course, nothing new. Directors, performers and audiences have been grappling with the scale of the play since the begininng. On stage and on screen, heavily cut versions of the play have been common. Even so, 110 minutes may seem a bit extreme given that a performance of the ""full"" text (conflating both the quartos and the first folio) can run over four hours. Even more remarkable, Almereyda (unlike, for instance, Olivier)chooses to keep both Rosencratz and Guildenstern and Fortinbras. I was amazed by how well Almereyda weilded the scissors. To begin with, he cuts resolutely. No players (an avant-garde film serves the plot function). No grave-diggers. Much of the batllement scenes are chucked. This spares us the kind of sawing off a line here and there for time (which so marrs the Kozintsev film), although the odd speach does go missing (I particularly miss ""There is a willow grows askant the brook...""). Further, Almereyda includes few wordless stretches such that the short run time is used to convey the most verse possible. My impression was that no major dimension of the play (political, sexual, psychological) was missing and in fact the film offers so much in each scene that it never occurred to me to ask for more. My second concern was equally allayed. The uses of modern settings and clothing is not meant to be self-consciously provocaive and counter-intuitive in the Luhrmn vein. It is simply modern-dress Shakespeaare.
  Almereyda also deserves great praise for taking on the play's meta-theatricality so directly. It is somewhat remarkable given that there have been so many films of Hamlet and that film, as an art-form, has been equally inclined to reflect on itself and explore self-aware performance (think 8 1/2) that no other director has reveled in these aspects of the play and turned Hamlet's meta-theatre into meta-cinema. Then again, most of the major films of hamlet (Olivier, Zefferelli, Branagh, Kozintsev) have been in period dress, often marble-mouthed to various degrees and film-makers hve felt queasy about translating theatre into film. Almereyda is by far the bravest in this department. Hamlet is frequently outfitted with a camera which he uses to capture the world around him, including both the things he loves (close-ups of Ophelia) and loathes (he is elaborately filming the press-conference at which Claudius delivers his ""Though yet the memory of Hamlet, our dear brother's death""). He then runs home to his slovenly hotel room where he seems to stay editing these together for hours at a time. This captures brilliantly the oft-noted paralell between Hamlet's search for coherence and meaning in his world and the audience's search for coherence and meaning in a play which often seems to foil or ignore audience expectations in uniquely cinematic terms. This comes to a head in the film within the film which is given a title sequence deliberately similar to that of the film we have are watching. As Hamlet has been seen on stage as tempted to espcape into the world of theatre, so this Hamlet escapes into the world of film. In a brilliant moment Hamlet delivers ""to be or not to be"" while walking up and then back down (roughly on ""aye thats the rub"")the ""Action"" aisle at Blockbuster. Having expent his energy in his soliloquy, he waits bored while the cashier checks out a large stack of videos.
  Of course any director of Hamlet must rely upon a strong cast and the cast proves to be extremely well chosen. Ethan Hawke plays a young Hamlet, looking to be just off to college. Often bored, wasting time watching movies and playing with his camera and visibly hesitating is attempts on the King's life, this is a hesitating, Coleridgian Hamlet. Hawke downplays (without ignoring) the cruelty and psychological torture of which Hamlet is capable. ""Get thee to a nunery"" is howled into an answering machine after Hamlet has alreay stormed out. Before Ophelia, he is only hurt. Likewise the barbs he throws at Polonius and Rosencratz and Guildenstern are off-handed and seem to Hamlet barely worth speaking to such inferiors. He does not take deep pleasure in them. Neither does Hawke have use for the ""antic disposition"" which becomes so central to the interpretations of Branagh, Tennant and others. These choices make for a refreshing and compelling interpretation which focuses on the hurt and sense of being in-too-far which this young man suddenly asked to grow up must endure.
  The supporting cast is uniformly brilliant but a few must recieve special note. Sam Shepard is a revelatory ghost. This performance is worlds away from the droning, ethereal gohst of Olivier's film. This ghost appears as flesh and blood and terrorizes Hamlet, at one point pinning him against a wall. Shepard understands how large the Father looms in Hamlet's psyche and how deliberately the ghost weilds that power. No performance I have seen is so alive to the possibility (never eliminated I believe) that the ghost is in fact a ""goblin damned"". Bill Murray drew much attention for his Polonius. His is not a foolish, dottering Polonius but an efficient, effective courtier and a loving father. Both aspects are well demonstrated when while forbidding her to make contact with Hamlet, he deliberately ties Ophelia's shoe. Yet perhaps most non-traditional is Julia Stiles as Ophelia. This Ophelia is brash, defiant and strong-willed, but instead of sitting uneasily with the text, this serves only to highlight the passive posture Ophelia assumes. We see more externally than we are accustomed to the inner struggle which will drive her mad. Khyle MacLachlan and Diane Venora are also exceptionally strong as Claudius and Gertrude.
  For the calibur of the acting, the brilliant direction and the constant and deep attunement to the text, this film stands second only to Olivier's seminal film. As that comparison alone should make clear, this film stands in the front rank of all films of Shakespeare.",1356652800,4,6640,4.990063233965673

Oh, was I ever wrong.  From the very first seconds I was drawn into THIS Hamlet production like never before, despite many times reading the play, many viewings of the many ways this many-played play has had.  Yes, it's somewhat avant-garde, but far superior to the other Hamlets of that genre.  Won't tell you the details, you'll have to watch.

They do cut scenes and lines, opting instead for a paced speaking of key lines which is WONDERFUL, with clear enunciation.  Whoever did the sound should get a gold medal or something.  (Typically, the sound in a filmed Shakespearean play is so horribly low, and the actors rush their lines; so unless you've memorized the play, you miss most of what's said.)

I don't want to say more.  JUST WATCH it.  Yeah, now I sound haughty again (lol)...",1326672000,9,1052,4.6521739130434785
1263867,2,B00003CXEJ,"For years, people have been telling me that this is the best version of Hamlet ever put on film. ""Don't bother with that boring Kenneth Branagh movie,"" said these nameless people I know, ""see the Ethan Hawke one instead. He gives the 'to be or not to be' speech in a Blockbuster video store, and it's awesome!""

Needless to say, the 'to be or not to be' speech is one of the greatest pieces of writing in history, and it sounds great in *any* setting - a Blockbuster video store, a castle, a public toilet, whereever. In other words, the setting of Hamlet (or Shakespeare in general) doesn't matter much; the background is just the background, and all that really matters is whether they get the acting and the directing right.

Unfortunately, this version doesn't get those things right at all. The cast is only half good; the ""antagonists"" (if that term really applies here), such as Claudius, Gertrude, and Laertes, come across well. But Hamlet and his chums are awful. Hawke mumbles and mangles his dialog, totally failing to convey the brilliance of his character, while the guy playing Horatio is wooden and at times downright incomprehensible. Bill Murray, meanwhile, gives his usual lazy performance as Polonius; am I the only person who laments his transformation from hilarious comedian to boring ""serious"" actor?

Another problem is that Michael Almereyda's direction is flat, failing to convey the power and beauty of both Shakespeare's text *and* New York City. Under his guidance, what should have been a kinetic film hits the screen with a thud. (One notable exception is the ""Mousetrap"" sequence, which - unlike the rest of the movie - is a clever updating of Shakespeare.)

In summation, the Branagh version is better - as is the Olivier version, as is the David Tennant version. This is not the best, but the most disappointing version of Hamlet on film. And who cares that part of it is set in Blockbuster video? It actually made me laugh - in a bad way - to see Hamlet in Blockbuster, renting VHS tapes, because it reminded me that this ""contemporary"" version of Hamlet is already totally dated!

1263918,2,B00003CXEJ,"Shakespeare is the man, or I guess I should say he WAS the man.  I mean, when you think about all the authors, visionaries, artists and the like who have made a permanent stamp on the world of modern artistry, Shakespeare tops that list.  Sadly, not every attempt at capitalizing on his influence pays off.  Sometimes reimagining a good thing can produce a great thing (just look at the '96 version of `Romeo + Juliet'), but all too often `trying' to make something new out of something old can produce something just plain bad.

Look no further than this 2000 version of `Hamlet'.

One of the main issues I have with the film is that the setting needed a different structure to make it effective.  The film feels too `modern' to mesh fluently with the Shakespearian style of dialog.  Some may balk at this statement and claim that my admiration of Lurhmann's `Romeo + Juliet' contradicts my griping here, but it doesn't.  The city of Verona that Baz creates is not modern to the touch.  It is a brilliantly crafted mixture of old and new, remaining neither yet both at the same time.  The dialog fit because the time and place was indistinguishable.  It was a place and time all its own, something that at once felt so ancient and then instantly so distant.  `Hamlet' feels like this afternoon and so the dialog comes across awkward and misplaced.  A reworking of the dialog would have aided in this films being something better than it eventually became.

The pacing was also a problem, and the way that some of the actors took to their roles was a tad (and sometimes more than a tad) cringe worthy.  I love Bill Murray, but his line readings were atrocious.

The films saving grace(s) are found in Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles.  Why can't either of these two actors get better work?  They are both so talented.  I mean, if I were to make a list of the most talented actors who NEVER get good work, they would top the list.  Sure, Hawke HAD good work at one time, but what has he done recently?  Stiles seemed to just disappear in the middle of this decade and that fact makes me very sad.  She was such a breath of fresh air.  In this film they both turn in award worthy performances, effortlessly chewing up every ounce of the dynamic energy that makes the characters of Hamlet and Ophelia so engaging, rich and memorable.  They would both make my extended ballot in their respective categories and I'll praise their work in this film till the day I die.

I just wish the film itself deserved their committed performances.

In the end I can't recommend this (it is so below expectations) but I will say that if you care about all aspects of film and want to see two of the best performances of the year then watch this film.

1263919,1,B00003CXEJ,"Really I did. The setting intrigued me, and I wanted to think that Hamlet could be done in a contemporary corporate setting. Perhaps it can, but, until I saw this, I had no idea that Shakespeare could suck so much.",1248220800,,214,4.375
1263920,3,B00003CXEJ,I unique addition to my collection.  I am collecting as many of the different video Shakespeare productions and this a good addition to my collection.,1234483200,,150,5.0
1263921,4,B00003CXEJ,"Normally I don't really get into Shakepeare that has been transplanted into modern times, but I think this 2000 version set in modern day New York City does a wonderful job of making that transition smoothly. The ""kingdom"" is now a large corporation which Hamlet's uncle has taken over. Fortinbras is an interloper looking to make a corporate takeover. You have modern young adults with their angst about life, which is quite believable. I really didn't have a problem with ""Shakespearian English"" being spoken - I fell into the rhythm of that quite easily.

I really tried to like Ethan Hawke as Hamlet. He definitely had the angst down. However, Hamlet was supposed to be incredibly witty and crafty. This Hamlet seemed mopey. A particular scene that bothered me is when Hamlet barges into his uncle's office ready to kill him. In the regular story Hamlet was about *in*action.

Ophelia was too snotty / eye-rolling. She is supposed to be very dutiful, following her father's orders without question. When she goes mad, she's supposed to be cheerful at her father's death. Instead she is (rightfully) grieving which doesn't make her mad, it makes her sane. I think the best scene with her was the break-up scene. This is one of the only versions I've seen where you really get a sense that this is a couple breaking up, that they loved each other and have a real emotional strain. The fact that Hamlet's emotions ""turn"" when he realizes Ophelia's father is listening in adds meaning.

Speaking of dad, I know Polonius is supposed to be half-comic but he's also supposed to be half-serious. Bill Murray played him straight as a bumbling idiot which was a shame. The ""saying goodbye to his son"" scene especially bothered me. It seemed very cold. In most versions this is a meaningful ""final talk"" between father and son.

Which comes to one of my favorite two cast members. Laertes. I really think this is the best Laertes in all the versions I've seen. Liev Schreiber is awesome. When he says goodbye to Ophelia you really get the sense that he loves his sister - and his talk with her about ""be cautious with Hamlet"" is delivered with honest caring, not with the snotty overbearingness that many other Laertes put into the talk. Later when he comes back after his father's death, you again really get the sense that Laertes loved his father, loved his sister dearly. In other versions Laertes is about rage. Here Laertes really loved his family and you can feel it.

The second cast member I think was awesome was, ironically, the Ghost :) In most versions the Ghost is an incredibly wooden, pasty character only there to recite some lines and vanish again. Given that the Ghost is the whole reason Hamlet does everything, that is a great shame. Here, the Ghost shows up multiple times and he has a real character. You get a sense that he was a firm, powerful executive who is furious at his conniving brother, disappointed in his wife and loves his son dearly. I am very impressed with this Ghost.

Kyle MacLachlan also deserves credit as one of the best Claudius characters. Usually it is really hard to figure out why Gertrude would have jumped for the Claudius in the show, or why the people love him so. Here you really can see Kyle's manipulating charisma, his sliminess and his oozing appeal all at once. He is definitely the scheming younger brother who has chafed in his brother's shadow for years and finally couldn't take it any more. You see this in the later scenes too, where he hits Hamlet. He is simmering, the heat cranks up, and finally he can't take it any more. I think this interpretation was very well done and far more believable than most other versions I've seen.

Gertrude, on the other hand, is very cold. She hardly flinches when she's told her son is mad. She is embarassed at Ophelia's madness!! That was just *wrong*. She is supposed to love Ophelia and be really emotionally upset by Ophelia's downfall, not worried about what the crowd might think.

I have many negative feelings about the ending fencing fight. I disagreed with how they did that for many reasons.

Someday I'll have to chop up all the Hamlet versions with video editing software and create a ""master Hamlet"" with my favorite Horatio, favorite Laertes and so on to see how they would all work together. I'd definitely take Laertes and the Ghost from this one. Maybe Claudius. The rest, however, will stay on the cutting room floor.

Still, fun to watch for those characters' scenes, and well worth having in your library.",1228694400,2,4523,4.706700379266751
1263922,5,B00003CXEJ,"Great video.  I used it in the classroom and showed several clips to coincide with the text.  The casting director made some great choices and the director stays true to Shakespeare's story as he would want it told.  The ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy is done beautifully--very introspective and spoken as Hamlet walks through a Blockbuster.

1263923,3,B00003CXEJ,"The idea of setting Shakespeare's masterpiece in modern-day New York proves to be a good one. The film's ominous tone and dark quality give the story a very ominous tone. Sadly, the film is nearly ruined by the acting. Most of the performers in this piece do nothing but recite the lines, failing to put emotional ""umph"" behind the characters, making this film nearly undramatic.
Ethan Hawke is a great actor, but doesn't have what it takes to play the Prince of Denmark. Kyle MacLachlan tries as Claudius, but isn't very convincing. Most of Ophelia's lines are mostly cut from the play, so Julia Stiles has little to do, but she's descent when she has the chance. And Bill Murray has NO place in a Shakespeare film. In terms of acting, the two stand-out performances are by Liev Schreiber, who's performance as Laertes is more tender than in recent portrayals; and Sam Shepard gives a very powerful performance as the Ghost of Hamlet's father.
Overall, this version of ""Hamlet"" is a disappointment due to some lackluster performances by what should have been a first-rate cast. It's hard to know who to recommend this film to. I'd say skip this version of ""Hamlet,"" and check out either Branagh's four-hour masterpiece, or Zeffirelli's film starring Mel Gibson.

The artistic choices aren't bad, but the actors in this version have no idea how to read Shakespeare.  The dialogue sounds stilted and gets in the way of everything this production is trying to accomplish.  Since it's all of the actors, I have to put most of the blame on the director.  As both an actor and a student who's spent years studying Shakespeare generally and Hamlet in particular, I can assure you that this version isn't worth your time.",1180828800,8,538,4.631578947368421
1263925,4,B00003CXEJ,"I was thinking for quite some time about the incongruity of using Shakespearan english in the modern context. The problem is:

1) In modern NY, no one speaks like that. This is known, accepted. So the moment we hear them use Shakespeare's original language, full naturalism, no matter how strictly attempted, cannot be fully achieved. You cannot suck the audience in completely.

2) Shakespeare is nothing without the language. You can't just take the plot, change the lines around, simplify them: without the twists and turns, the wordplay and the thick meanings, a filming of merely the plot will amount to utilising the skeleton of any old folk tale.

I believe that the modern relatively deadpan acting method is contrary to the inherent theatricality of Shakespeare's language. Therefore, if it needs to be filmed in a modern context, it must necessarily be

1) over-the-top, and theatrical, and outrageous, like Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" or

2) it must be done by exceptionally gifted and experienced actors already steeped in Shakespeare who can recite the soliloquys even while comatose and can import all their experience, all their gravitas, all their past successes into a medium that is essentially new to Shakespeare. All films of Shakespeare so far have been ""filmed plays"" with theatrical acting, or over-the-top attempts like R+J or like this one -

Hamlet (2000) is a noble attempt, and some parts really work, but in the end it's a somewhat lethargic, uncertain prod, overall. Laertes does well, and Shepard's ghost is convincingly restrained.

Bill Murray and Ethan Hawke, sorry to say, are all at sea. The complexity of Hamlet is completely gone. Yes, Hamlet is melancholy. Yes, he is young and foolish, at times, but also noble and innocent. But he is divided, pulled and pushed by forces within and without, feelings in him are awakened after a grisly murder of his own father that were alien to him before - and every word of the soliloquys is painstakingly written and meant to support that. Every small nuance is meant to be acted, to be played, to be demonstrated to the discerning viewer - here, it's about 80% gone. Gibson played him as a raving lunatic, a Mad Max of Elsinore, but there was still a lot in there. Unfortunately, there's very little here.

Murray had apparently never done Shakespeare before, and it shows - he's reciting it, not acting it. It was very painful to watch him Laertes' farewell scene. Julia Stiles isn't given much, as if sometimes she seems on the verge of saying something, but doesn't. Venora and MacLachlan play their parts well - Venora with gusto and MacLachlan a little too passive at times.

I would still recommend this to those who'd like to check out what can be done with it in the modern setting - it is an interesting effort, a good amount of thought has gone into it and some of it comes of very well. But this isn't a definitive Hamlet by any means, and no way in hell should it be the FIRST Hamlet a person watches.",1179532800,4,2992,4.782945736434108
1263926,1,B00003CXEJ,"Usually, I feel like I can suspend disbelief and get at least SOME point out of other's works - even if I don't LIKE them so much.

I was just lost here.  By everything, at every turn.

The only sense I could see was what I though MIGHT be the intent of the film... to show that the complexities and difficulties we see as being part of Hamlet's being carry into those we might see as ""lesser souls,"" merely because of our proximity to them, or our familiarity with the social structure in which they live, or their appearance... or age...

Only problem is, none of this surfaced in the actual FILM.

For me, it all came down to the moment of Hamlet's death, when Horatio says ""Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.""  I found myself completely unable to concieve of how these words might have ANYTHING to do with this vapid, void, powerless guy on the floor.  It was as if the death of a hamster would evoke the same deep sense of wasted nobility.

I felt nothing - which, to be honest, happens to me sometimes as a result of my sporadic ability to be monumentally dense.  But in this case, I'm pretty sure it was because there was nothing to feel.",1175212800,6,1206,4.300884955752212
1263927,4,B00003CXEJ,"Some reviewers have complained about the acting and the casting for this modern dress Hamlet.  Clearly Bill Murray as Polonius is something of a joke.  He is competent in speaking his lines, but he might have achieved a better effect had he played the part for laughs.  (Although The Bard certainly would not have liked that.)  Polonius is paradoxically a figure of ridicule because of his pomposity while at the same time he is the repository of some ancient wisdom.  It's a delicate part to play and I don't think Bill Murray got it right.

And then there is Julia Stiles as Ophelia.  I thought she was competent, but failed to project the sort of distracted, suicidal imbalance that the part demands.  And why didn't they let her sing the ditty instead of just pronouncing it before the king and queen in the mad scene?  If Stiles can't sing a little (and it only requires the thinnest of voices) maybe she shouldn't have played Ophelia.

Kyle MacLachlan played Claudius as an Enron-type CEO, merciless in his greed and malevolent in his desire to secure his hold on the corporate reins of power.  The prayerful scene (overheard by Hamlet) in which Claudius remarks aloud that his ""words fly up,"" but his ""thoughts remain below"" is done in the backseat of a limo driven by Hamlet!  In Shakespeare's play, Hamlet does not kill the king at that moment because Claudius's soul might very well go to heaven since he is in prayer.  Recall that the ghost of Hamlet's father complains that he was murdered with ""no reckoning made,"" but with all his ""imperfections"" (sins) still upon his head.

Most questionable to some is Ethan Hawke as the ""sweet prince.""  But I thought he did an excellent job and was very like a 21st century, privileged American (a secular ""prince"") pretending to be going crazy.  And I am sure that the Ophelias in the audience thought he was just wonderful.

Certainly there can be little criticism of Diane Venora who played Gertrude to a tee.  Incidentally the queen's chamber scene worked wonderfully well with Hawke becoming well the son disgusted with his mother, and she, seeing her tragic failings in her son's eyes, becoming the very embodiment of shame.

I also liked Karl Geary as Hamlet's loyal friend Horatio.  I thought it was interesting that here he has a silent girlfriend who is almost always with him.  (She's silent because Shakespeare wrote no lines for her!)

But putting all that aside, what I think is wonderful about this production is that it worked!  Modern Hamlet in New York City, the ""king"" really the CEO of a Danish corporation, the kingdom, that corporation, the castle, its New York corporate headquarters.  How simple.  But would it play?  And what adjustments and cuts and pastes would have to be performed on Shakespeare's immortal script?  Well, practically none.  A lot was cut out, but almost all productions of Hamlet leave out a lot, c.f., Olivier's Academy Award-winning film from 1948; Zeffirelli's 1989 Hamlet light starring Mel Gibson, etc.  The most notable exception is Branagh's magnificent Hamlet from 1996 in which nary a word was cut from the text of the play.  If you really want to experience Shakespeare's Hamlet at its best and fullest, see that Hamlet from 1996 starring Kenneth Branagh, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and Derek Jacobi.  You can read along as you watch it.  (See my review.)

Here we have selected speeches played over a backdrop of modern life in the Big Apple.  Every word is from Shakespeare with the exception of a couple of things seen on TV.  A security guard plays Marcellus; Fortinbras' army in the background is a rival corporation seen in newspaper headlines; the drape behind which the ill-fated counselor hides only to be stabbed by Hamlet becomes here a hotel closet with mirror through which Hamlet fires a bullet so that Polonius becomes indeed ""still.""

There is a sword fight at the end as in the great play, between Laertes (Liev Schreiber, who brings some welcome subtlety to the role) and Hamlet.  It seems natural in a sense because both privileged young men could have taken fencing at prep school and university.  There is no bubbling brook across which Ophelia lies.  Instead she finds her quietus in the hotel's fountain.

The graveyard scene in which the skull of ""Yorick--I knew him"" is unearthed is skipped over, probably because the tit-for-tat between Hamlet and the gravedigger would not make much sense to modern audiences.  (Laertes still jumps into Ophelia's grave, but I must say without the full bravado that Shakespeare intended.)

I guess I liked this more than others because I expected a lot less and was pleasantly surprised.  Part of the power of the production comes from the close camera work on the faces of the players--something that surely would have delighted Elizabethan audiences--particularly when listening to some of the longer speeches.  The trick in all of this is to make the Shakespearean speeches sound natural and very like what people today might say.  I thought that Michael Almereyda, who wrote the adaptation and directed, pulled this off very well.

For those of you who are high school teachers, I highly recommend that you show this to your classes.  It will definitely help your students toward an appreciation of this great and timeless play.  (And then show them the Branagh film.)",1174348800,5,5342,4.870288248337029

1263969,2,B00003CXEJ,"The idea behind modernizing `Hamlet' is a smart one and it's an idea that, in capable hands, could have been brilliant, but here it comes off a bit boring and wanting.  Unlike the '96 remake of `Romeo + Juliet', `Hamlet' doesn't fully capitalize on the language and setting of the script.  With `Romeo + Juliet' everything fit.  When guns were referred to as swords it made sense.  When everyone spoke the mumbo-jumbo that makes Shakespeare what it is, it made perfect sense.

I think that's mostly due to the atmosphere and scenery that accompanied the film.  Verona was not set in modern times.  It was grungy and dirty and felt either too old or too new, something either from long ago or far off in the distance and thus made the speech and communications between characters understandable, but with `Hamlet' everything feels like today, like now and thus makes the language feel out of place.  Plus, no offence to Bill Murray who is a great actor but his line reading here was atrocious, comical even, as if he struggled to get out every line.  I was pleased when he was killed.

The acting though on the part of Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles were brilliant award worthy turns and brought at least a sense of reason behind the film.  Just watching Ethan's Hamlet change with his eyes alone was astonishing, some of his best work to date, and Julia was just fantastic as Ophelia.  Her breakdown was effortlessly done (although Kate Winslet's version was better) and proved to be the highlight of the film.  Like I said, the idea behind it was a good one, but the setting ruined it, made it long-winded and boring.  There is a scene where Polonius (Murray) is explaining Hamlet's situation to his mother and uncle and he just stands there for like five minutes struggling to get his lines out and it's excruciating to watch.

With some work this could have been a much better film, but instead a film about a priceless tragedy becomes a tragic interpretation that fails to live up to its high expectations.",1169424000,3,2008,4.648725212464589

It feels sterile to the point of making the viewer wonder why one would care about any of these people.  The text is sliced and diced to such a degree that anyone even somewhat familiar with it will cringe with the director's choices in what to leave, what to leave out, and what to switch around.  Ethan Hawke as Hamlet says his lines in a stiff monotone that shows his lack of comfort (and understanding?) of the character.  He comes off as *too* suicidal and lethargic to follow through with his charge of revenge.  During ""to be or not to be,"" he might as well be reading off cue cards.  Also, I am a huge fan of Bill Murray, but here he is terribly miscast as Polonious.  Of note, Diane Verona is somewhat compelling as Gertrude.  I could go on with the rest of the cast, but suffice to say, as mentioned in other reviews, Liev Schreiber is the only one worth watching, and in that, he is simply outstanding and utterly riviting as Laertes.  He is fluid in the character and clearly understands Laertes' motivations.  He is the only reason I gave this production two stars and I'd love to pluck him from this production and deposit him in Branagh's.  I rarely write reviews of anything I find less than palatable because I follow the ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all"" philosophy, but in this case, my hope is to save those who haven't seen the masterpiece that is Hamlet from basing their opinion of the work on this.",1169164800,,1567,4.5212765957446805

That is the whole point of contemporization and if you open your mind , it really works.

Ethan Hawke defintiely deserved an Oscar for portraying the contemporary Hamlet , the self-absorbed young film-maker , and Kyle MacLachlan portrayed perfectly the moral rotteness of Claudius.

Julia Styles made a beautiful Ophelia and played the role with feeling and sensitivity.

I though the scene where Hamlet shoots Polonius (Bill Murray) was excellently done , and came off with no hitches.

1263972,4,B00003CXEJ,"I've loved ""Hamlet"" since I was 17, and seen many different movie versions of it.  What I like best about this version are the little nuances, the tiny moments that provide bits of insight into the story or the characters.

For instance, the way that Laertes (Liev Schreiber) interacts with Ophelia (Julia Stiles) provides many of these moments.  When he leaves at the beginning of the film, he takes one of her barrettes with him.  When she's gone mad, he keeps putting his arms protectively around her, like a big brother who wants to shield his shattered sister would.

Another example is the way that Polonious and Laertes always seem to be looking past each other.  There's father-and-son affection there, but they're really very distant.  Polonious wants to seem like a good father to Laertes and Ophelia, always dispensing advice, but you really get that he has no idea who they are.

(SPOILAGE ALERT) At the very end, they throw a great twist in -- Gertrude understands not only that Claudius killed her husband, but that he's trying to poison her son.  She drinks the poison out of both remorse for her past actions and in a vain attempt to save her son.

Hawke makes Hamlet more tangible.  Having attended a liberal arts college, I am very familiar with this type of self-absorbed amateur film makers.

Top to bottom this is a solid film, an interesting adaptation, and is probably as entertaining and thought provoking as the material was intended to be by its sublime author in 1601.",1134864000,4,350,4.85
1264021,4,B00003CXEJ,"This brand new version of Hamlet has it modernized for the 21st century. Set in a modern New York background but not changing the Shakespearean dialogue. This film is another nice view on the play of Hamlet. But not the best of the film adaptations of Hamlet to film. But a good one for younger and unknown crowd to Shakespeare.

The plot familiar to most people. Is of Hamlet (Ethan Hawke) prince of Denmark that returns to find out his father is dead and that his mother has married his father's brother Claudius. So everything is confusing to him in his return. Seeking the truth is his goal which is escalated by the ghost of his father. Further to explain the plot is pointless. Whats not pointless is to mention the the little bits changed by writer-director to modernize it. The film is presented in the 21 century in New York. With cameras and computers and Hamlet using these things to present his uncles guilt. Also guns. I mean for a modernization of Shakespeare they have done a good job. As well the best part is the retaining the original Shakespeare dialogue and not changing it. So you can retain the true essence of Shakespeare.

The film very well cast in my opinion for the young generation. Ethan Hawke not what you would call a theater-Shakespeare actor but he is not bad at all. The choices that I especially admired and liked were the casting of Kyle Maclachlan perfect as Claudius. Bill Murray as Polonious. This was really the start of Bill Murray getting some recognition for his dramatic acting ability and some other roles as well. And last Liev Schreiber giving a great performance as Laertes and being in my opinion a great actor for the future. We have seen further into his acting ability in The Manchurian Candidate as well. Now to talk about the writer-director Michael Almereyda. Not a big director with big film on its resume. But a man with a long list of credits though his resume. This probably is his biggest production.

Another thing to mention is to compare this film. This film you can compare it in two ways. One this to the other Hamlet films and this to the other modernizations of Shakespeare into film. This not the best version of Hamlet. Its cool,nice and very well made. But this is really for the young and unknown crowd of Shakespeare. The best is Hamlet by the great Laurence Olivier. For classic Hamlet lovers. My preference is to Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. But there also Anthony Hopkins Hamlet and the Mel Gibson Hamlet film are nice as well. To the modernization. Its very well placed in my opinion in New York. But I didn't like the whole thing of Hamlet filming things with a video camera. I don't know. That just me. The best change of Shakepeare material to something modern is Titus. It mixes old Roman sets and envroment with a nice touch of guns,cars and other little bits. And another modern Shakespeare film is O for Othello. That just takes the story and charcaters and changes the setting and the dialogue. Good film. But without the dialogue you lose Shakespeare.

The DVD is a dudd. No special features at all. Only the German Region 2 DVD release had some interviews of Ethan Hawke and Kyle Maclachlan but that's it. The look of film is outstanding due to the great cinemetograpy. If anybody is interested in being immersed into Shakespeare for the first time this film is not a bad start. But don't forget classic Shakespeare as well.",1133222400,5,3407,4.626446280991735
1264022,4,B00003CXEJ,"Personally, I really enjoy this version of Hamlet.  It is an artsy, updated version that to me does more justice to the original script than Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet.  I think they tried to stick with the essence of the story--even though it takes place on Wall Street and Hamlet uses a gun.

I have used the scene between Laertes and Ophelia to help introduce Shakespearean language in a Hamlet unit, and it works well to convey the original language in a modern setting.  I like seeing the hint of Ophelia's suicidal thoughts; her desperate madness seems more realistic, and though I didn't get the crossed eyes, I really loved her stopping in a busy building and screaming her head off.  The new take on the ""play within a play"" was done well and fit in with the shocking nature of its content.

Ethan Hawke does a good job as the brooding Hamlet, but I have to say that out of the performances, Bill Murray as Polonius and Liev Schriber as Laertes did a wonderful job, each adding a certain tenderness, even though Polonius is quite overbearing.

If you can handle the ""artsy-ness"" of the film, you'd probably enjoy it.  If you're looking strictly for entertainment, go with Branaugh or Zefferelli.",1123459200,4,1208,4.665094339622642
1264023,1,B00003CXEJ,"I remember watching Siskel and Ebert many years ago, wondering why I thought Siskel was off base in his reviews, and Ebert was on.  Eventually I came to realize that Siskel placed more value on art, and Ebert placed more value on entertainment, and I value entertainment over art.  This very difference is the problem with this movie.  As art it may be incredible, but as entertainment it is tedious and boring.

The difficulty here is not so much the acting, which is good, but the juxtaposition of modern actors speaking Shakespearean English, and doing it in a way where ambient noise often muddies part of the speaking, and having less dramatic emphasis on the actions of the players, eventually this movie just tries too hard without ever succeeding.

The difficulty with translating play to screen is that the media are different.  When you are on a stage you have to be grandiose and dramatic.  Shakespeare knew this and created characters who emphasized their actions in a way that enhanced the dialogue.  The subtleties of humor infused in this attempt come through, if you were looking for them, but the drama never really makes it to the screen.

The result of these issues is a movie that just never really entertains.  As one example, my daughter thought the recent remake of ""Romeo and Juliet"" was wonderful.  She purchased the DVD because of her enjoyment.  On the other hand, she, along with the others in our family that watched this, wondered why we bothered.

Keep this movie as fodder for analysts and college classes.  Everyone else should watch one of the earlier, better versions, or go see the play.  You will be much better entertained.",1114905600,4,1661,4.799295774647887
1264024,2,B00003CXEJ,"There are so many movie versions of Hamlet out there, so what makes this one special? Well...it's in modern times. It might be more useful for English students who aren't really familiar (or just can't handle) with the original style of Shakespeare's play. For the most part, it does it pretty well. But the only problem with this film is how the actors can't seem to grasp the language naturally! It's one thing to know the lines of Shakespeare's entire play, but saying it realistically without it sounding as if it were memorized is another, and that's something that this film doesn't do to well. At times the way the actors speak the language comes off being kind of awkward and almost forced, to some degree it even gets distracting. And the other huge problem is that they don't put much emotion into how they speak Shakespeare's language; it almost feels as if all they did was memorize but didn't practice on making sure the audience can FEEL the characters, instead of hearing them speak an archaic style of speech. This is not a BAD film, but it could have been so much better. I would only recommend this for people who would rather watch a modern version of Hamlet instead of a more older version.",1113868800,,1210,4.606481481481482

Not only is it spoken as if the actors have no idea what any of it means, but the background noise keeps drowning it out. The actors themselves were not the best choice. Julia Stiles may be the hottest thing around, but her ""Mad"" scene was more ridiculous than compelling. And the use of Polaroids of flowers, instead of actual flowers? Come on!

Bill Murray is another strange choice. When he's explaining to Claudius and Gertrude that Hamlet is mad, it's blatently obvious how uncomfortable he is with the dialogue. As for Ethan Hawke, a slacker Hamlet I can do without. I didn't feel anything but annoyance for him. This film was also very gimmicky, lots of product placement. I could not believe it when Hamlet's Ghost disappeared into a Pepsi machine. The final scene was botched. It was too rushed, much like the entire film. And when Hamlet and Laertes finally killed each other, I'm still not clear on how that happened.

Set in modern-day New York City, but retaining all of the play's references to lords and castles, this film is the most ridiculous and contrived adaptation of Shakepeare I have ever suffered through. Hawke plays Hamlet as a pouty gen-Xer, whose soliloquys are played back on a hand-held recorder. Must been easier to hide the cue cards that way. When Hamlet and Laertes pull out fencing swords on a New York rooftop, it's true eye-rolling time...although not as horrid as when Bill Murray, playing Polonius, hams his way through ""to thine own self be true.""

At first, perhaps Ethan Hawke doesn't seem like the right choice for Hamlet.  He has always been a competent, even likable actor of the gen x variety who has never really done anything of weight or levity.  But at second glance, he is the perfect choice, after playing a host of different brooding philosophical young men contemplating life and death (Reality Bites, A Midnight Clear).  He seems to have been taylor made for the part.  He is brooding, yet subtle.  He is a man of action, but a man who needs reason for his action.  He makes the character of Hamlet relevant to twentysomething Americans who may not have connected with the Brannagh Hamlet.",1110240000,,950,4.791411042944786
1264067,5,B00003CXEJ,"This is certainly an ambitious and for the most part, at least, a very well thought out and well executed version of the play. Particularly given the endless times it's been performed and reinvented, and that Hawke isn't overly impressive in the title role, it is surprisingly successful. For my money the only real glitches are a couple of casting errors, one larger -- Murray as Polonius tries but just can't get it, as good and likable as he may be -- and one not very large -- the completely flat performance of Thurman (presumably related to then Hawke significant other Uma) as Guildenstern. But there are more than enough casting and subsequent performance triumphs to well outweigh those, from MacLachlan's interesting Claudius to Shepard's presence as Hamlet's father to the modern fragility of Stiles as Ophelia all the way down to Zahn, whose Rosencrantz must have not only the best physical entrance of about any Rosencrantz in history but who also carries through nicely on the occasions when only his voice is heard. But maybe the real gem is Schreiber, whose Laertes is so good that you wonder if the final result wouldn't have been even better if he and Hawke had traded roles (although in a situation reminiscent of Brandauer and Redford in Out of Africa, it's hard to imagine that suggestion going over commercially with production heads).

Apart from all this, and of course the play itself and its ideas the language of it, which have obviously proved superb over the test of time, you have to give the makers credit for not just dropping the story into Manhattan in the year 2000 but also for genuinely and creatively following through on that with a commitment to work in especially the various media with which we communicate today. On maybe just one or two occasions (the pay phone, for example) does this seem a bit forced or unnatural; on manyh of them it is remarkably insightful and touching and brings you into the language and world of the play (such as the constant use and editing of film by Hamlet). And that's exactly what a modern interpretation of a centuries-old work should do. All were clearly aware of the sentiments of the play and how to update them for our age, as one can see throughout the film in general but also in the genius of a few specific points (for example, the way Hamlet's brooding while aimlessly wandering the aisles of a Blockbuster Video store and his lackluster renting of a dozen or more films captures a very modern world weariness perfectly suited to the character).

I watched it 3 times in a week and enjoyed it each time. Can't imagine that someone giving it a fair chance would come out of the experience anything but very satisfied.",1108771200,9,2702,4.7224576271186445
1264068,4,B00003CXEJ,"OK, Hamlet has been done. It's been done a lot. A new one has to have something special to attract attention. This one has it.

It's a successful update of the classic story into contemporary Manhattan boardrooms, with the the CEO ""royalty"" of Denmark, Inc., staying at the luxurious Elsinore hotel. Hamlet himself is an art student, already brooding and edgy by nature. The party at which Ophelia makes her scene is a black-tie affair at the Guggenheim. Ophelia (Julia Stiles) is true to a 2000-era teenaged girl, with sneakers, baggy pants, attitude, and her tummy in the breeze.

A few things fit much too well, like the goons in Claudius' entourage. A few things fit poorly, like Bill Murray. I admit, he makes a serviceable Polonius. The problem is that he's Bill Murray, with ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" all over him. A few things are remarkable additions. The ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy, for example, debates life and death as Hamlet roams the aisles of a video store. On the monitors, in the background, we see ""The Crow: City of Angels"" DVD playing. It's a movie in which life and death are not the only options, a well-placed echo of Claudius himself.

The original language is all here, even though the cadence falters rather often. The modern idiom of sight and sound, background music included, attaches very well to it.

Ignore the purists and look at the basics: the story is still true and strong, however it's spoken.

I came on to see all the praise for this fantastic movie, and instead i saw critcs without open minds, and the slashing of the only Hamlet worth watching. So, i figured i better write a review of my own.

  I came in on the middle of this movie when i first saw it, and i was so drawn to it, like a magnet to its attractable surface, that I became enamored and had to watch it. I already liked Ethan Hawke, but after this i became his ""fan."" It amazes me how much his acting career has matured since Dead Poets Society. I saw his potential there, but here it really shines.

  Anyways after that first viewing of the movie it became glued onto my brain and i never forgot it. This movie made me love Shakespeare more than as just the author of Romeo and Juliet. At this point i realized Shakespeare was amazing.

  The way they also use the book of Hamlet in modern day New York is not only creative, but also inspiring, and original. If you're kicking the tires of Shakespeare go and watch this unnoticed classic. Trust me, you'll get in and enjoy the ride.",1096761600,8,1170,4.1415929203539825

I think that if the language had been modernized that this adapatation could have been a little more acceptable.  But the younger actors, including Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles, just couldn't seem to handle Shakespeare's lines properly.  Many of their lines were rendered rather woodenly.

Had the producers chosen better seasoned Shakespearian actors this movie would have had some real potential.  It's a shame that star-power could so blight a promising film.",1094774400,4,703,5.232142857142857
1264071,3,B00003CXEJ,"Working from the assumption that no modern interpretation of Hamlet can be 'perfect,' the best I think we can hope for is that each interpretation gets a few things right; but that, taken together, all other interpretations can only be an accesory to the original text. This Hawke version gets a few things right, and more things wrong.

Pros:

-I like Murray's Polonius. Polonius is, in many ways, a perversely sympathetic character, and Murray's depiction of a tired man and a loving father seems about right.

-Hawke does a passably good job with the monologues, especially 'to be' etc. As a lot of reviews seem to note, this monologue is delivered in a Borders video store, which I think worked pretty well. You have that sense of contrast between the lofty sentiment and the prosaic surroundings.

-At first, Stiles seems ideally suited for an Ophelia. Her constantly opaque, distracted expression and monotone delivery work well - while she's still sane.

-I like this interpretation of the ghost. You can see a certain amount of ambivalence in the way it threatens and terrifies Hamlet, rather than just appealing to his sympathies. The actor also does a fairly good job.

Cons:

-The film tends to butcher the language which should be its foundation. Way too many lines are delivered offscreen as the camera is panning around (a problem in a lot of modern Shakespeares), and visual effect displaces the words. A lot of important lines are also delivered without the proper emphasis. You wonder if the director is even familiar with the time-honored practice of having the camera focus on the character who is speaking.

-Two crucial scenes, Ophelia's death and the final duel, are just plain butchered. The idiosyncratic cheerfulness of Ophelia's lunacy, in the play, is one of the things which makes her death so disturbing, and Stiles' plainly grief-stricken interpretation loses this entirely. As for the end, several important speeches, all on Laertes' part - his statement that, in essence, he does forgive Hamlet, but still must demand satisfaction; and his farewell to Hamlet after he is wounded - are omitted, depriving him of most of his character. He doesn't have many other opportunities to speak in the film, and becomes flat without these lines.

-Several elements don't work in the modern setting. You can say that it's abstract, and that's acceptable to a point, but the idea of Hamlet being sent to England, where his _head will be cut off_ - detailed in exactly those words in the movie, in an e-mail - does a lot to harm the film's credibility.

-Overall, I don't think Hawke gets Hamlet. Obviously, there's more than one way to read the character, but Hawke is way too morose, lacking any of the wit or eccentricity which it seems would have to characterize someone who willingly feigns madness. This is really evident in the 'you are a fishmonger' scene.

So, it's not the best recent version of Hamlet, but I also like it for another reason; that in a way it frees Shakespeare from the prison of Orthodox interpretation by taking so many liberties with the text and setting. Shakespeare was a populist author when he wrote, and I can't understand how his immensely entertaining work has now become the exclusive property of pedantic, Polonius-esque professors.",1094342400,40,3289,4.929475587703436

The use of contemporary locations throughout this movie is sometimes clever or witty, but never really hits interesting and always distracts from the play. The main conceit -- Denmark as a corporation, etc -- just doesn't fit the language, and each time someone refers to CEO Claudius as ""dread lord"" it serves to remind us of just how poorly the metaphor works.
Hamlet spends much of his time with a video camera, and clearly the director thinks he has something very important to say on the media or some such, but I have no idea what.
Ethan Hawke's performance brings out the unenergetic side of the role, as half the film is him muttering iambic pentameter in a dull monotone. There's no straining against his inability to act, he just can't be bothered to. I suppose this is a valid interpretation of the role, but it's deathly boring.
Julia Stiles does not appear to understand most of the lines she is speaking.
I'd have to recommend the 1991 movie starring Mel Gibson over this one. At least Mel Gibson wasn't wearing a stupid hat.",1089504000,2,1201,4.669811320754717

One reveiwer here has pointed out that the cast's inability to handle the language is most likely the fault of the director; I'd say that's true, but the inconsistency and superficiality of the vision is also the fault of Michael Amlereyda.  The source of the problem seems to be that no one involved in the movie (with the exception of Diane Venora, who has played numerous parts in Shakespeare, even in Hamlet, before) has any convictions about the play, their characters, or Shakespeare.  Contrast this movie with Baz Luhrmann's innovative Romeo and Juliet, and you'll see Almereyda's inspiration.  It seems as if he just wanted to cash in on the Romeo and Juliet craze--he even echoes that film by having Fortinbras' closing speech read by a newscaster on a TV set, as the final speech in Luhrmann's movie is read by a newscaster on a TV set.  I'm not opposed to modernizations of Shakespeare--I'm opposed to thoughtless rip-offs.
I'd like to list the movie's redeeming qualities, but can think of none.  Diane Venora is always worth watching, but she's much better as Ophelia in Kevin Kline's production.",1087344000,2,1203,4.872549019607843

For anyone who has read and understood the play, Hamlet is a complicated character. He is clever, educated, and in many parts pf the play utterly hilarious. Hamlet is in some sense troubled, but he is not mad. He pretends to be; teasing Polonius, tricking Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, trying the patience of his mother and uncle. This is what makes him so memorable. BUT Hawke's performance loses this. His hamlet is forever moping, sullen and melancholy. He drones lines like 'My wits diseased' with the same monotone seen throughout the film, when this line is supposed to be sarcastic, mock-crazy. Hawke makes Hamlet into the stereotypical suicidal boring teen. Whether this is due to poor direction or the fact that Hawke doesn't get Shakespeare, I don't know. But it ruins the play. It ruins all the propects of a terrific movie. I mean the cast could have been great. But somehow, the idea flopped.

1264114,5,B00003CXEJ,"If you are a Shakespeare purist, you are going to hate this movie. There are no theatrical extremes or classical cliches. There is nothing remotely traditional about this presentation of Hamlet.
That said, you should know that this is the most artful and humanistic portrayal of Hamlet ever put on film. In this film, Hamlet is neither an inaccessible eccentric nor an Oedipal mess, but a film student, a tortured and lonely artist. Ethan Hawke gives a performance that puts a dark and brooding perspective on a character who is normally portrayed as maniacal. In this movie, Hamlet's madness is buried so far within him that it radiates from the inside out. This is what most ""mad"" people are really like, and also why Hawke's Hamlet is one that for the first time an audience can actually relate to.
And this new humanity is reinforced by the talented supporting cast. Julia Stiles gives a haunting performance as Ophelia. Kyle McLaughlin and Diane Venora, as Claudius and Gertrude, act with fiery lust toward each other and chilling disdain toward Hamlet. Liev Schrieber gives an incredible bitterness to the role of Laertes. Sam Shepard, as the ghost of Hamlet's father, gives an excellent cameo performance. Even Steve Zahn, much to my surprise, gives a very funny take on Rosencrantz. My only complaint is the casting of Bill Murray as Polonius. He isn't really cut out for Shakespeare, but his prescence could be seen as a sly throwback to Ghostbusters. This is one of many hidden references and clever interpretations in the movie that may go over the heads of some viewers but make the story fresh for those who know it.
I am truly sorry that most of the people who reviewed this movie could not appreciate its ability to be innovative while preserving the ideas and the mood of Shakespeare's play.

It's always interesting to see where in that exchange Hamlet realizes that he's being spied upon.  Sometimes at ""Where's your father,"" but sometimes elsewhere.  I thought the film within the film was great, too, a sort of more honest representation considering the medium that we're watching the work in.  I like Horatio.  He's actually one of my favorites, very neutral and attractive.  I don't like all the product placement, the ghost by the pepsi machines for example.  And while I kind of like the Blockbuster tobeornotobe, with clips of Brandon Lee's The Crow and James Dean in the back, and Hawke walking past the ""Action"" section are clever, I wish there were some things left a little more generic.
  Claudius confesses his sin in the back of a limo that Hamlet is driving.  This is a good scene.
  Mostly I was pleasantly surprised at Ethan Hawke though.  He ends up doing one of the best screen Hamlets; much better than the so overrated and sucky Olivier, and better than Williamson, too.  He's not quite as goofy as they sometimes try to be, but he's Ethan Hawke, so you can't take him too seriously to begin with.

Almereyda has the guts to bring it down to an everyman level, and he does so in an inspired and organic way.
Yes, there's humor in it.  So what?  All of you chiding the scene in which the ghost disappears into a Pepsi machine, did it ever occur to you that he's being swallowed up by a corporate logo, which is in keeping with Almereyda's whole vision of the story?  It's funny, but what's wrong with complicating the emotions we feel during these scenes?  The moments of humor make the tragic ones more hard-hitting than those Hamlets that treat every scene like a maudlin death march.
Shakespeare wrote Hamlet for the masses; he wrote it to be entertaining.  He didn't write it so that directors would bow down in front of it and chastise those who don't treat it in the proper, Elizabethan manner.
My point is, lighten up.  It's an amazing play, and I give Almereyda credit for recognizing that without being afraid to make it personal and still have fun with it.  This version hits me in the gut more than any other purely because it isn't larger than life.  It's deceptively simple, and wonderfully realized.  The most original, personal and, in many ways, the most complex Hamlet film I've ever seen.  Get off your high horses.",1050969600,7,1764,4.630225080385852
1264120,2,B00003CXEJ,"It seemed the director could not make up his mind whether or not to make this a Hamlet set in 2000 or 1600. The intolerable dichotomy of the characters and setting quixotically existing in 2000 while the language is invariably that of Shakespeare - a theoretical possibility - but not with this director or this cast by any means - proves to be an utter and unmistakable disaster.
The only saving grace, and the only reason I didn't give this 1 star, was for the effort put forth by Ethan Hawke. As evidenced by his Oscar-nominated performance in Training Day, he can act. You can't blame him for the terrible direction and production of the movie - i.e. walking through Blockbuster Video while delivering the ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy. Furthermore, the ingeniuous idea of Hamlet's father's ghost disappearing into the Pepsi One vending machine made me just about lose it. The last straw was Laertes pulling out a gun and shooting Hamlet in the final scene - an utter and unspeakable repugnance that made me want to vomit. Nice effort on Hawke's part - but that's it.",1047081600,3,1072,4.647368421052631
1264121,1,B00003CXEJ,"I'm not gonna bash the original script because, well, it's Shakespeare, and maybe his greatest work.
  The director's concept for his production, I thought, was valid.  One of the beauties of doing the Bard is that by his very timelessness he prevents egomaniacal, numbskull directors and screenwriters from ""updating"" a piece into oblivion.  Which is not to say that Almereyda is either; he puts together a film that is a good cut of the original play, and is visually both interesting and illuminating.
  The huge, glaring hole in this film is, unfortunately, in the portrayal of the title character by Ethan Hawke, a normally fine, if minimalist, actor.  So, the performance (word used loosely) may not be Hawke's fault since acting in film is analogous to acting in a puppet show.  Maybe this performance is what the director wanted. (in which case he should be, in the future, kept at least 300 feet from his actors)  Maybe in the editing process those involved decided they wanted Hawke to look like he had no idea what forces drove his character, and only cut in takes where he wasn't doing anything.  Maybe the filmmakers decided that Shakespeare's original conception for the piece was of a five hour play centering on the moral dilemmas of an unmotivated, unreadable, cream-of-mushroom-soup lead. (does everyone else here doubt that, too?)
  I have seen many Hamlets: the Oedipal Hamlet, the Existentially Paralyzed Hamlet, the Emotionally Crippled Hamlet, the Overly Intellectual Hamlet, the Just Plain Angry Hamlet, etc...  What I have never before seen, and hope to never see again, is the take presented here: the Apathetic Hamlet.
  Three stars for the visual elements of the film, plus three stars for the screenwriter's cut of the original play, minus five stars for missing the point of the play entirely.
Want to see an interesting Hamlet?  Check out Derek Jacobi's RSC production aired on the BBC in the mid 80's, Kevin Klein's aired (on PBS?) in the early 90's, or even ego boy Ken Branagh's uncut production which released theatrically in the mid 90's.  Avoid Mel Gibson's Hamlet, unless you are in it for all the other fantastic performances.  That said, however, Gibson's performance is still more interesting than Hawke's, which makes me wonder even further about Almereyda's credentials to direct actors.  Maybe he should make films without them.",1043712000,10,2372,5.035897435897436
1264122,1,B00003CXEJ,".....for even spending your days there would be more interesting than having to sit through this drivel. I did so want to like this adaptation of one of Shakespeare's best known plays. I have enjoyed both Baz Luhrmann's modernisation of 'Romeo and Juliet' and thrilled at Richard Loncraine's brave 'Richard III'. However Michael Almereyda has added an absolute turkey to this canon of Shakespeare updates.
But where did he go wrong? For a start, Ethan Hawke is a pleasant enough actor (given the right material, such as 'Gattaca', he can more than hold his own) but clearly is out of his depth playing Hamlet. He comes across more as a petulant teen than a young man seething through a vast array of emotions. Julia Stiles seems to be the young actress du jour, but she is no Ophelia - she merely wanders around with a surly look on her face. Kyle Maclachlan is wasted in the role of Claudius - a villain he will never be. The only actor to come out with any credit is Bill Murray as Polonius and of course he lasts only until halfway into the film.
Any updating of Shakespeare's work should be applauded, especially if it means appreciation by an even wider audience. Unfortunately in the case of this 'Hamlet', most viewers will be lucky to last the first act. For any students who want to see a movie instead of reading the play, you would be far better off watching Zeffirelli's 'Hamlet' with Mel Gibson in the title role.

To me this single example sums up how sorry this rendition of Hamlet is. The leading actor, the director, and everyone else associated with the making of this awful movie failed to correct Hamlet's misplacement of a preposition that dramatically changes the meaning of what is probably the most famous group of lines in all of English literature. In my humble opinion, sloppy work like this destroys the whole point of producing a play like Hamlet. If they're not trying to reach an audience who knows the work and cares about it, then who are they trying to reach? This film has no substance.

This is the only Hamlet I have ever turned off before Horatio laments the cracking of his friend's heart.  I stopped it because this Hamlet is heartless, an empty thing that swings between pretense and silliness, as if a college fraternity had mounted the play as a drunken prank.
There are some who find setting the play in New York compelling and Hawke's attempt at Hamlet winsome.  Both could have been interesting (but face facts: Manhattan-as-Denmark and a fresh, untutored Hamlet are hardly new ideas).  What destroys this Hamlet is the abuse of Shakespeare's language.  Naked actors who understand the rhythm and punctuation of Hamlet can land this play on bare concrete.
I would be more forgiving if this were presented as a learning experience by a student director.  To put the actors through this nonsense and present it to the public as a serious work degrades the actors and wastes the audience's time.",1040774400,10,1142,4.978947368421053

1264161,2,B00003CXEJ,"One of Shakespeare's greatest plays gets modernized and transported to New York City in the year 2000, with Ethan Hawke taking on the role of the brooding Prince of Denmark.  This version of ""Hamlet,"" written for the screen and directed by Michael Almereyda, initially holds much promise, with what appears to be an outstanding cast through which Almereyda can present his vision of this oft-told tale of murder and revenge.  That ""vision,"" however, turns out to be somewhat clouded, and though the basic story remains intact, it comes across as something of a ""Cliff's notes"" rendition that is less than satisfying.  And by the end we realize, too, that not all actors-- even good ones-- are cut out to play Shakespeare.
Hamlet's father, the King/CEO of the Denmark Corp. has died, and within a month his mother, Gertrude (Diane Venora), has married his uncle, Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), who has also taken over the company.  Hamlet, now ensconced in the Elsinore Hotel, grieving for his father, is appalled by the marriage of his mother to his uncle, and moreover, with such haste; but it is done, and there is nothing he can do about it.  Soon, however, Hamlet discovers that his father was, in fact, the victim of murder most foul, and vows to avenge his untimely demise.  Immediately, he sets a course that will bring the perpetrators to justice; but it is a course that must necessarily end in tragedy for Hamlet, as well.
With his screenplay, Almereyda has retained enough of the basic story that even the heretofore uninitiated will be able to grasp Shakespeare's original intent, at least in regards to the plot.  The presentation, however, falls entirely short of providing the full impact of the tragedy.  Almereyda's approach is altogether too solemn and lacks the energy needed to truly bring this film to life.  And while it's true that the story is inherently introspective and melancholy, the director fails to explore the many possibilities available to him-- especially with the contemporary setting-- that could have made this vibrant and exciting cinema, such as the way writer/director Julie Taymor brought Shakespeare's ""Titus"" to the screen so successfully.  Add to that the fact that Almereyda's adaptation of the play is terribly wanting; the character development is lacking, and though the language of the play remains, Almereyda's judgment of what to keep and what to lose in making the necessary cuts to bring a four hour production down to just under two, are questionable.  Hamlet's famous soliloquy, ""To be, or not to be,"" for example, is truncated into oblivion.  In the final analysis, this was a project perhaps too ambitious for Almereyda at this point in time; knowing what ""happens"" in the story is not the same as knowing what it's ""about,"" and in some of the choices the director makes, it's obvious that the ""essence"" of the play has simply eluded him, much to the detriment of the overall film.
As far as performances go, they range from outstanding to the downright laughable, which is disappointing but not surprising, considering the eclectic nature of the cast.  Liev Schreiber, who has one of the best voices in the business and the elocution to match-- custom made for playing Shakespeare-- is nothing less than exemplary in the role of Laertes, and among those assembled here is in a league of his own.  A tremendously talented actor, Schreiber has not yet achieved the acclaim he so richly deserves, languishing too often in forgettable films like ""Kate and Leopold"" and ""A Walk On the Moon,"" though he was perfectly cast as Orson Welles in the made-for-TV film, ""RKO 281,"" in which he was brilliant.  Without question, with his masterful interpretation of the material and his natural eloquence, he is the saving grace of this film, in which, alas, he is afforded a less than propitious amount of screen time.
Only two others in the film even approach Schreiber's level of excellence, the first being Kyle MacLachlan, in his portrayal of Claudius.  MacLachlan, at least, finds the rhythm and flow in his recitations that make his character believable and convincing, and his scenes with Schreiber are the most interesting aspect of the film.  The only other actor in the film who can stand alongside Schreiber and MacLachlan is Diane Venora.  Unfortunately, in this offering, Gertrude has been reduced to a role of silent observer in most scenes; when she does speak, however, her words are well spoken and meaningful, and it's a shame that she is so grossly underused here by Almereyda.
Then there are the performances that fall into the ""acceptable"" category, but are far beneath the capabilities of the actors involved, respectively:  As Hamlet, Ethan Hawke adopts a brooding attitude that is effective, but he fails to achieve the commanding presence necessary to make his Hamlet viable.  Sam Shepard, as the Ghost of Hamlet's father, is simply unconvincing.  And Julia Stiles, as the doomed Ophelia, seems to be grasping at straws in a vein attempt at finding her character, and of the three mentioned here, her performance seems the most strained and unnatural, though it is so with both Hawke and Shepard, as well.  All of which points up that, again, not all actors can play Shakespeare.  It's difficult; and those who make the attempt should be commended for it, even if the results are less than noteworthy.
Make that ""most"" of those who make the attempt; because in the case of Bill Murray, someone should have put a stop to it right out of the chute.  Murray is arguably one of the best comic actors the screen has ever known, and that is not something to be taken lightly; comedy is one of the hardest genres to master, and Murray is one of the best.  But his portrayal of Polonius is embarrassingly laughable; there's no other way to put it.  And it's one of the many reasons that make this version of ""Hamlet"" forgettable.  There's just no magic in it.",1034985600,5,5919,4.898898898898899
1264162,2,B00003CXEJ,"This updated version of Hamlet was interesting, I must admit, but I wondered during most of the film why, for a hip and modern ""Y2K"" Hamlet, was this film not directed by Luhrmann when it was so obviously inspired by his interpretation of Romeo + Juliet.  Granted, Luhrmann is about as subtle as a Pollock painting, and Hamlet is a far more paced and strategic work that needs to be spared being drenched in Luhrmann's invasive technicolor with a disco beat.  However, I don't know if Almereyda was the filmmaker for this particular job.  He seemed to feed off of memorable moments in R + J and regurgitate them into his own unoriginal backwash (most blatantly, the final scene that completely ripped off the opening and closing scenes of R + J's modern day news anchor narration).  If he would have concentrated on the rich and grim beauty of the original play and not the appeasement of an MTV savvy demographic, I feel that it would have been a much more complete and respectable work.
There were parts of this Hamlet that I enjoyed, though.  The acting by Venora and Shepard was wonderful.  MacLachlan played a nice Claudius.  I had to wonder, though, why on earth Ethan Hawke got the title role instead of Robert Sean Leonard, whom which this role seemed more suited for.  RSL is by far the more talented of the two actors and more comfortably natural in a Shakespearean atmosphere.  Hawke seemed tragically in place, however, with the trendy Julia Stiles who should have never ever been given the role of Ophelia.  Poor Bill Murray was the most out of place actor in the bunch, god love him.  I'm still trying to figure out the relevance of showing Polonius' oozing brains.
It was an interesting effort, and I wasn't disgusted or felt like I had wasted my time watching it, and I didn't mind the modern setting or the spiffy shots of NYC hot spots, but, much like Almereyda's ""Nadja"", I think his reliance upon grainy video collage as innovative filmmaking falls a little flat.  There was also a significant amount of lines removed.  I wonder if there was a ""director's cut"" of this film, and if so, would it have revealed a more true-to-the-original feel to it.  There is something innately wrong with a version of Hamlet clocking it at under 2 hours.
I agree with one of the reviewers who said the title is misleading, because one could go into this movie assuming that it is a faithful version of the original when, in fact, it is an abridged and at times unflatteringly manipulated experiment in video collage and product placement.  Did my eyes see it correctly when Hamlet's ghost disappeared into a Pepsi machine?!  That moment, alone, was enough to poison this movie.
I also agree with another reviewer who said that, if it weren't for his/her familiarity with the play, this version would be very confusing.  It was abridged enough that it skipped through sections so quickly, I felt like I had to rewind to understand the significance of the prior scene.  And the dialogue was often mumbled by the brooding Hawke, making me feel that much more disinterested in and detached from his character and actions.  If this was the director's intention, though, he indeed succeeded.
Nonetheless, I think this movie is worth a look to Shakespeare buffs just to see a modern interpretation of the classic.  I think the casual onlooker who is unfamiliar with the text will be utterly lost and bored within the first half of the film, but it is an interesting experiment in filmmaking that, however, should probably have been rethought about two dozen more times before making it anywhere near a theatre.  <...",1033689600,4,3613,4.721337579617835
1264163,1,B00003CXEJ,"I was furious when I read the glittering review of this film on the Amazon site (well, not furious, I guess I just disagreed with it strongly).  Even the reviewer couldn't help but comment on how every single actor was plastic, rigid, stiff, or unapproachable in some way.  Those meaningful and beautiful lines which were not delivered with all the passion of a sixteen year old reading off the local Denny's menu were sliced right out of the picture.  And, despite the updated setting (which I have no problem with; Elizabethan actors didn't worry about period costumes), nearly every detail could be forseen minutes or even hours before appearing on screen.  In fact, I would have almost been disappointed if we had not seen the inevitable shot of this videophile Hamlet watching Laurence Olivier's superior version.  No adaptation of Shakespeare has been so insulting to its source material since (yeah yeah, all you depressed sixteen year olds, break out the pitchforks and torches) Baz Lurhman's unnecessary and too-cute titled Romeo+Juliet.  Any version of Hamlet, be it Olivier's, Mel Gibson's, Kenneth Branagh's, or heck, even Branagh's Noises Off-ish A Midwinter's Tale, which is only a movie ABOUT people putting on Hamlet, would make for a better evening's watch than this badly failed experiment.
I have but one compliment to lend Almereyda's version (bit of a spoiler, I suppose): it is the only production of Hamlet I have seen in which Gertrude knows the wine is poisoned before she drinks it, in an attempt to warn her son of treachery.

Besides Hawke as Hamlet, we get to see an always convincing Julia Stiles as Ophelia, Bill Murray as Polonius, Liev Schrieber(Scream 1&2, Sphere) as Laertes, Diane Venora(Heat) as Gertrude, and Kyle MacLachlan(Twin Peaks mini series) as Claudius. Other notables are Steve Zahn(Joy Ride, Out of Sight) and Sam Shepard as the Ghost.
English teachers should allow their students to watch this version for a change; they might actually come to enjoy Shakespeare. A highlight to this film is hearing Hamlet say the ever famous ""to be or not to be"" speach while walking through a Blockbuster. Excellent twist.

1264196,5,B00003CXEJ,"This movie is perhaps the best version of Hamlet put to film. Less melodramatic than either Kenneth Branagh's or Lawrence Olivier's traditional versions of the play, Almereyda has created a film that uses Shakespeares text extremely effectively but at the same time this does not take away from the movie's visual quality. Cinematography and editing are perhaps the most important part in a film and the problem with bringing Shakespeare to film is that Shakespeare is about language not image. In terms of performances, Ethan Hawke offers a new interpretation of Shakespeare's most complex character. He portrays Hamlet as a confused adolescent and young filmaker, who is almost driven mad by what he sees in the world. He sees the world through the lens of his video cameras and Almereyda demonstrates this by adding a very dark and bleached look to the colors of the film.
This review is really just a brief outline of what could really be a long essay about this film's art. In short, the film is a masterpiece and bridges the gap between literal imagery and visual imagery.",1028332800,4,1078,4.896174863387978
1264197,2,B00003CXEJ,"Perhaps I was spoiled by Baz Luhrmann's excellent modern interpretation of ""Romeo + Juliet,"" but I found it difficult to sit through the length of this version of ""Hamlet."" I grant you that ""Hamlet"" is a very difficult play to put to film; there is so much character depth, so many details to put into the story that a proper version would be far too long for most audiences. It's a big story designed for a big stage, and it doesn't lend itself well to film adaptation in my opinion.
Ethan Hawke is practically oozing angst throughout, which is pretty apropriate, but his mumbling about with his little video camera gets way too old way too fast. The direction is also way too stylized - too edgy, too frenetic; it tries to jazz up something that really can't be turned into a funky, hip-hop, fast-paced story.
Too much of the meat of the play gets left out, and too much of what's left in would be difficult to follow if the viewer didn't have a basic grasp of the storyline ahead of time. Also, and it pains me to say this, Bill Murray is horrible...he should have stayed away from the role of Polonius. Granted, Polonius should be  played by someone who does foolishness well (and Murray has absolutely done so, elsewhere,) but there is a large difference between Shakespearian humor and modern humor. Murray, sadly, doesn't have the Shakespearian abilities required.
There are no special features on the DVD, which is unfortunate; perhaps some interviews with the director and screenplay writer would cast some light on some unclear areas.

1264198,3,B00003CXEJ,"There are problems with this film.  While ""Hamlet"" the play is arguably the greatest drama ever penned, it is here done in a curiously understated and often ""un-dramatic"" style -- what is served by this approach?  And when Shakespeare is performed by manifestly non-Shakespearian-quality actors, it leaves quite a bit to be desired, notwithstanding the occasional flashes of excellence (except that Bill Murray's flashes were very rare).
  The cuts in the play, and other liberties taken, result in something of a disjointed and disappointing production.  Cutting edge scholarship, which does NOT interpret the ""To be or not to be"" speech in the vein of suicidal ideation, is not here represented (VERY disappointing).
  A glaring understatement is the unfortunate decision to present Sam Shepard's ""Ghost"" as not at all ghostly!  Hamlet's equivocation mostly is to be viewed as a result of his uncertainty regarding the shadowy Ghost's credibility (In the Middle Ages, if not now, ghosts were viewed as mere goblins, unpossessed of the decedent's actual spirit. Hamlet understandably  fears that he is being diabolically  duped into performing unjustifiable murder.)
  The unrelenting ""product placement"" throughout the film is not only distracting but downright annoying. It is said that when actors are filmed smoking, that what we have is an ad for smoking -- but when Marlboro packs are seen sitting on the table, well, that's an ad for Marlboro.

In fact, it's quite a shame that the basic plot had to be killed and maimed so much, defying most any sane interpretation.
My yelling at the television started when Ophelia visited Hamlet.  Before this, there had only been mumblings about Hawke's lack of emotion.  I thought that this scene might redeem the picture. Nope.  Now, I believe that it is fairly accepted that for Hamlet's treatment of Ophelia to be construed properly, it must be stipulated that he has overheard Cladius and Polonius conspiring against him.  Furthermore, the stuff that he says is directed moreso at the King, who he knows is listening, than at poor Ophelia.  Oh well.  Did I miss the fact that Hamlet actually knew?  Was his surprise at uncovering the bug false?  Hrmm.  Oh well.
All in all, the cutting of various things bothered me as well.  Rosencratz and Guildenstern were almost useless.  Polonius was signifigantly cut, so much so that when he dies it almost seems as though he is most completely a victim.  Oh well.  The guns, the guns.  Cladius is also not shown as much as a manipulator as he should be.  As to why Hamlet does not kill him in the Limo, I haven't the faintest idea.

Someone just needed to steal that hat Ethan Hawke wouldn't take off. Apparently the makers of this movie were overbudget...this assumption stemming from the blantant advertizing throughout.

1264204,2,B00003CXEJ,"This potentially intriguing attempt to rethink ""Hamlet"" as a contemporary play must be admired for its courage and boldness in fearlessly hacking away any vestiges of Elizabethan mores or customs by depicting the story in the present day. In an intrepid endeavor to make the tale more accessible to his audience, director Michael Almereyda sacrifices many of the more familiar passages in the text, making this ""Hamlet"" much more of an adaptation than any previous attempt to film the play.
In some cases, the experiment really works. Hamlet is depicted as an amateur filmmaker who attempts to snare Claudius with a homemade short subject of ""The Mousetrap."" While this means sacrificing the speech to the players, it forces the viewer to accept Almereyda on his own terms. And if Laurence Olivier could do without Rosencranzt and Guildenstern in his film, Almereyda can do without the gravediggers and ""Alas, Poor Yorick."" But ultimately Almereyda is confronted with the grim reality that he is trying to cram a colossus into garment in which it would never fit: the duel in Act V is a fiasco, with Laertes inexplicably pulling out an automatic pistol and blowing everyone away in a bloody melee. It is a scene more fit for Peckinpaugh that Shakespeare, and turns everything that precedes it into a mockery.
Almereyda's raping of the text results in numerous casualties amongst the cast. Julia Stiles' Ophelia comes off the best, investing the character with such a touching vulnerability that I would rank it as the most moving depiction of that character that I have seen on film. Less fortunate are Bill Murray as Polonius and Kyle MacLachlan as Claudius, whose interesting performances might have been extraordinary if their roles had not been cut to the bone. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sam Shepard's Ghost lacks any impact at all and can only be dismissed as inadequate.
But what truly sinks the film is the appallingly amateurish performance of Ethan Hawke in the title role. Hawke sleepwalks through the film, [pulling] the life out of every scene in which he appears and forcing the audience to wonder what possessed Almereyda to cast this no-talent in the role in the first place. Hawke is only saved the distinction of giving the worst Shakespearean performance in the history of film by virtue of the fact that Keanu Reeves' embarrassing turn as Don Pedro in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" was committed to celluloid.
This film is an intriguing ""Might Have Been,"" but Almereyda and Company do themselves in when Hawke's Dane is going through film clips in his home studio and at one point screen a five-second clip of John Gielgud performing the ""Alas, Poor Yorick"" speech. In that blink of an eye, an astounding reminder of what the play might be in more capable hands makes Almereyda's ""concept"" appear as the mere mumbo-jumbo that it is.",1019692800,3,2857,4.929460580912863
1264205,3,B00003CXEJ,"If this had been my first exposure to Hamlet, I'm sure I wouldn't have had a clue as to what the play was about after seeing this updated version.
There's a lot of great talent in this film, but for a lot of them, this isn't their shining moment, and some seem acutely ill at ease with the bard's liquid phrases.
Liev Schreiber as Laertes is one of the exceptions. He rises like cream to the top, and seems very comfortable in the part. Also good is Diane Venora, looking gorgeous as Gertrude, and Sam Shepard is a wonderful Ghost.
Whoever decided that Hamlet should have a ""grungy"" look, carried it to an unpleasant extreme...and that woolen cap with the earflaps ! I realize this was done to make him look ""unhinged"", but it bothered me. This film loses a star, just for that hideous woolen cap.
Otherwise, the art direction is good, and the cinematography (John de Borman) is excellent, highlighting some great architecture (it also highlights a lot of ""in your face"" product placement).
Listen for Eartha Kitt's ""buckle up"" message, it's a welcome chuckle...and I like the funny Holloween ghost child !
This film is an interesting curiosity piece, but I recommend seeing the Zeffirelli/Gibson version afterwards, which is a film that gets better with each viewing, and would be in my ""Top 10"" list of all time favorites.",1019174400,3,1324,4.711206896551724
1264262,3,B00003CXEJ,"Any time a director brings Shakespeare to the modern day, I am willing to watch.  This helps show the audience that the issues covered by the Bard of Avon are still relevant today.  In this take on the tragedy, you will see Denmark Corporation rather than the country of Denmark.  All else is a close parallel.
Hawke does well as portraying the brooding Hamlet.  Unfortunately, he does not really excel past the brooding.  For a role of this type, I would like to see a bit more range.  Likewise, I do not see any range in the characters of Ophelia or Laertes.  Bill Murray, who I feel should be an ideal Polonius, appears puzzled in playing the role seriously or comically.  Sam Shepard is great as the ghost of Hamlet's father.
The setting of a corporation rather than the country is a good change.  This does make it difficult because the original wording is kept.  Words such as ""prince,"" ""liege,"" and ""queen"" do not seem to fit the setting.  This is hard to overcome.  Related to the words, for some reason everyone seems to want to speak softly (for introspection).  This does make the film hard to listen to.  At times you will feel like you are watching a foreign film.
Not all scenes are present.  There is no ""dagger I see before me,"" or ""Alas, poor Yorick.""  Some scenes are altered, but I am not sure why.  For instance, the guards who see the ghost first in the play are not all guards in the movie.  Theoretically, this shouldn't be a problem, but I could not tell what Horatio's job was.  Why was he in the corporate building at midnight looking at the monitors?
I would watch this as a counter to the other versions of Hamlet.  I would not recommend this as your only viewing of Hamlet.",1019001600,,1702,4.446601941747573
1264263,4,B00003CXEJ,"Shakespeare's plays are just as relevant today as they were when they were first written and performed. Unfortunately most modern audiences never recognize that. They just think of Shakespeare as some cruddgy old author that they were forced to read in school who has no real value today. On the contrary. Shakespeare has never been more relevant and this latest film rendition illustrates how.

The modern setting of the film fits perfectly into the structure of the play. Overall the acting was excellent and the imagery resonates in the imagination long after the final credits have rolled.

Ethan Hawke is a wonderful actor and captures the brooding essence of Hamlet's tortured soul. Also, the interpretation of many of the scenes shedded new light unto the text for me (e.g. Ophelia contemplating suicide long before Hamlet's seemingly rejection of her love and the death of her father).

However, the movie does have a few flaws. Out of all the actors, Julia Stiles seemed to have the most difficulty with the language. The poetry did not flow from her lips naturally and seemed forced. Though, Hawke gave an excellent performance, we never really see the madness of the Prince. This is a crucial element of the story and is not displayed in the movie. Instead, in the instances when Hamlet is supposed to be in a state of madness (whether feigned or not does not matter) he appears to be a spoiled brat. The whole gun episode that climaxes the film, doesn't work that well; the poisoned blades should have been left and Claudius doesn't receive the same death as King Hamlet like he should (poison in the ear). Finally, Claudius never appears in a church in an attempt to repent of his evil deeds. In the movie, he bows his head as if to pray, but that should not be enough to dissuade Hamlet's sizzling anger from blowing out Claudius' brains.

These flaws are rather minor, yet they prevent the film from reaching it's full potential. Nevertheless, the movie is highly entertaining and is a great interpretation.

I am all for modern interpretations of Shakespeare - I've even done a couple - but these actors, particularly Bill Murray, could not have seemed less interested in the material. ""Concept Shakespeare"" never works because you have to fit the play into the concept, and not the other way around. Ethan Hawke is a good actor, but woefully miscast in this. Also, setting up Denmark as a corporation as opposed to a country sets the stakes very low, and makes us not care what happens after a while.

Occasionally, that worked for Ethan as sort of a disaffected angsty thing, but often it was just unconvincing. Liev Schreiber was an acceptable Laertes, but for my money it was Sam Shepard who outshone everyone else in his tiny role the ghost of Hamlet's father.

But after that's all over you still have to endure the rest - absolutely AWFUL!  Back to Murray - you'd think that Bill Murray as Polonius would be a super-buffoon, but he actually came off like a really nice, concerned Dad-type.

The Ophelia of Julia Stiles is a masterpiece and her thinking of a watery grave during the ""talk of maddness"" scene is one of my favorites. ""The Mousetrap"" film, the club scene with R&G, and the use of modern tools like faxs and phones shows this story to hold as true today as it did the first time it played.

I was hoping that the rocky beginning to this movie would make itself up towards the middle of the movie. As the movie played on, it just kept getting real depressing watching Ethan Hawke mumble his Shakespearan lines and play the role of a depressing, suicidal and drab character. As for Julia Stiles character, for the most part, it looked like the cat got her tongue. There was only one scene where she had any real dialogue or acting to do. Bill Murray made rather a brief exit from the movie. A couple of things also lended itself to the demise of this movie. Firstly, the overly obvious PEPSI ONE vending machine appearing as a tunnel for Sam Shade's character. Then, Ethan Hawker wandering around in Blockbuster video rental store. I wonder if the advertisers wrote a part of this script especially where their products were involved. Why did they have to do Shakespearan lines ? I think they could have achieved their purpose by playing regular characters and delving on the character personalities a little more in modern day New York nut yet. The final scene came down to an anti-climax frenzy where Hamlet was fencing with his brother on a skyscaper in the middle of the nite in front of his family. Fencing !?!

I liked the way soliloquies were presented as the character's private thoughts rather than speeches for the audience. The background music also greatly added to the mood of the play. This movie is cast well, featuring Ethan Hawke, an actor who is actually close to the character's age in Shakespeare's tragedy (a refreshing change), and whose performance is magnificent. Sam Shepard's role as Hamlet's father is very captivating. The rest of the cast is excellent, as I was impressed by their ability to roll early modern English off their tongues as if it were modern English.

No doubt this Hamlet will offend someone, it exposes our culture AT THIS MOMENT too ruthlessly.  But if you want to see real artists doing fine, wild and authentic work, don't miss it.  I thought our opportunities to see such an original risky vision in film were gone forever.  Consider the way young Hamlet, a photographer, is constantly turning in on himself -- watching himself watch himself -- through windows of various media, all the while being spied on by Claudius whenever possible.  I'm ignorant of even the names of most of his visual equipment and was frequently a bit confused and disoriented.  AND found it all pretty creepy...So guess what?  The film let me share in young Hamlet's experience (who was also often confused and feeling creepy).  Consider how Polonius, Laertes and Ophelia embody modern dysfunctional family life: invasiveness, secrets, the spoken truth disconnected to true emotion...the sullenness and horrible dependence of Polonius' adult children; the malignancy behind his constant blank look of innocence.  (Bill Murray was unimaginably brilliant as Polonius.)  Watching those characters, too, often left me feeling uneasy. As did Claudius and Gertrude. And others.  Scene after scene, this Hamlet packs an enormous punch.  I didn't think it was flawless and it's not instantly the best ever.  But for complexity of intent and new, exquisitely appropriate images, it deserves full recognition.  The film was a gift to us of vital creative energy.  Only, don't watch it if you're not prepared to be uncomfortable some of the time: one way or another it will leave you feeling exposed.  Dare I say it?

1264313,2,B00003CXEJ,"Being a HUGE fan of all-things Shakespeare, I came into the viewing of this film with great optimism and high expectations.  The casting seemed VERY exciting in some cases and very ""interesting"" in others.  Needless to say, these bright expectations were quickly quashed.
I really don't know where to begin.  I have always felt that Ethan Hawke is a very capable actor, and a great choice for this role.  However, the direction, textual cuts, and production design were so inferrior and ill-concieved, that I doubt that even Olivier could have made a palatable film out of this mess.
The initial concept and premise for the movie are great, but Michael Almereyda completely fails to tie everything into a tangable, watchable film. As stated before, the casting gave me an initial boost of expectations. Bill Murray was undoubtedly an interesting choice for POLONIUS, to say the least.  Unfortunately, Murray seems to fall tragically short of his mark, and leaves a great deal to be desired.  Perhaps the Bard's text was simply over his head.
I own many versions of ""Hamlet"" (Olivier, Branaugh, Gibson, Burton, and Nicol Williamson), and was looking forward to adding this version to my collection.  However, after veiwing it on a rental basis from the local video store, I opted to ""pass"" on purchasing it.  This version is simply not worth owning.

It was passionate, youthful and very believeable, putting me in tears in some points and making a lot of sense with her ""father, PLEASE!"" looks as doting Polonius (Bill Murray) patronizes her.  Bill Murray did his early farewell to his son perectly - a father giving some last minute banal advice to cover his sorrow at his son's departure.  The scene where Hamlet confronts mom in her bedroom and kills Polonius is very effectively done and makes more sense than most I have seen.  There are a host of other modernizations that serve to bring out some areas really well.  The play within a play becomes a film montage within a film montage, but that works well with Ethan Hawke's interpretation of Hamlet as a brooding college kid.
On the negative side, there is quite a lot of dialogue cut, and some of your favorite scenes may be missing, but it generally makes sense.  The only exception is the final scene where a modern sword fight ends in death by gunfire, and Laertes blurts out an 'I forgive you' to Hamlet which makes you wonder 'why?'

This version spoke to me more than any other film version I've ever seen. Almost every bit of updating seemed organic to the story (the dueling scene aside).  The families are so modern in their dysfunctions, in their inabilities to relate to one another, and Hamlet's detached attitude is completely pertinent to young adults today. And delivering the ""To be or not to be"" speech in the action aisle of a Blockbuster Video? Come on, that's brilliant! Even if you must fault Michael Almereyda for his choices, at least give him credit for having a take on the story. Franco Zeffereli's was fine, but about as safe as you can make it. Kenneth Branagh's was an excuse for elaborate sets and costumes, with absolutely no interpretation or real feeling. Almereyda obviously feels close to this story, and he goes out on a limb to express his vision. I think he does it beautifully. This is not a pale and heartless updating (Baz Luhrman?). It comes from a very personal place, and therefore should be open to varying opinions. But please give Michael Almereyda credit for having a vision.

1264317,3,B00003CXEJ,"Modern adaptations/revisions of Shakespeare always remind me of circus bears. They'll wear a flowered dress, ride a unicycle, jump through flaming hoops, but the muzzle never comes off. While Almereyda's Hamlet put on a better show than most, it never felt dangerous, and that's a shame.
The basic problem is that the willingness to experiment and venture into risky territory seems confined by a deep-seated reverence for the Bard (I recall a scene in Pacino's Looking for Richard, an oustanding film by the way, which discussed the American fear of acting Shakespeare). Scenes that display fresh ideas seem rehearsed and thought out ahead of time. ""OK, I'll tell you to look for Polonius in the other place and then you'll punch me."" The acting itself becomes a set piece or an accessory. Rather than possessing the character and doing something completely unexpected, the innovation feels tired even as you're watching it for the first time. It's acting by committee. All the spontaneity has been storyboarded ahead of time and all that's left to do is jump rope without tripping.
That said, I very much wanted to love this film. Some of the ideas work extremely well and I found myself smiling as Hawke did such things as pick up a payphone to say one last thing to his mother while he dragged Polonius away. But the acting detracted greatly from all that was going on around the characters. Hawke was almost unvaryingly dull. And Stiles as Ophelia - it was like she was in another film. When she actually crossed her eyes during her great moment I thought I was watching the freebasing scene from Traffic.
If a modernization is to be done, it needs to be a complete reappraisal. I would love to see the set and design of this film combined with the acting and panache of My Own Private Idaho topped off by some daring editing and cinematography, something like Woo, or Wong Kar-Wai, or even Terry Gilliam. Use the camera, make some unexpected cuts. Make it truly modern. The camera work in this version was pedestrian and uninspiring and the musical score was so bad and inappropriate that it became a nuisance.
One last thought: the actors involved did do this film for scale and I have a lot of respect for that. But I wish they didn't have to make the sponsors so blatant. It made two great scenes impossible to take seriously: I'm surprised his father's ghost didn't stop to indulge in the cool, low calorie freshness of a Pepsi One. It will bring them back from the dead for just one more taste.

The setting is absurd given that the archaic language is preserved, as are all of the titles and place names. The acting is stale and lifeless. It is as if these people are reciting bible verses or poems they had to memorize for school.
Changing the visuals isn't up-dating Shakespeare. The props are so obviously stuck into the film in order to remind us that this is 20th century ... America, of course. It would have worked had we been left to draw our own parallels to the original Hamlet, from that which we saw. That opportunity is blown for us by the obvious attachment of names and titles smacked like labels on to modern things, people, concepts, and then the out-dated language which makes it all so unbelievable.

True, to see Hamlet's monologue among Blockbuster's video stands implyingly screaming ""action"" or Ophelia drowning in the pool of Excelsior hotel is weird, and incompatibility between 16th century verse and Armani-clad PC operating characters is eye-striking. Whatever excesses of set pieces design the actors are acting against, I would like to thank the Director for offering us such original decisions.
Thankfully, it's not some action movie with Hamlet operating a machine gun and Claudius being an ugly cartoon villain, it is still the drama of an ordinary person discovering murder and nurturing revenge, but hesitating to face its consequences and afraid of bloodshed.
Still, I'll take down one star for the unconventional editing of the ending (the fencing is still there, but the whole scene lacked depth, to my mind). In general, a very good adaptation of a classic that still moves a modern mind. I wonder what version will be the next? Hamlet plus Star wars? The rest is silence....",994809600,3,1764,5.2811387900355875

It has less to do with Shakespeare's play of the same name then Strange Brew! Instead of watching this warped, massacred, and boring rendition of Hamlet you should just take off your shoe, kick a wall as hard as you can and start reciting all of the lines from the play that you can remember. You'll certainly get more lines than the actors did.",990921600,,455,4.493975903614458
1264371,5,B00003CXEJ,"While some people may have a beef with the setting of this movie (for example, the ""to be or not to be"" speech in a Blockbuster store), I must disagree. The concrete and steel city provides a marvellous backdrop for Hamlet's brooding. Most important, this was the first time I've seen an Ophelia who's believable and understandable, and I've seen at least four versions of ""Hamlet."" The ending was abrupt and startling, especially for those who are familiar with the story -- but it worked. It was able to surprise me and still not seem like carving up Shakespeare. And the acting was superb! The characters could have been in modern New York, yet Shakespeare's words didn't seem awkward in their mouths. Ethan Hawke is the perfect brooding prince, and Horatio was made into a memorable character.",990489600,11,797,4.824817518248175
1264372,4,B00003CXEJ,"I think, before writing this DVD off as a fluke as many people on this review page have done, that everyone should consider the fact that the crew of this movie has done a wonderful job in interjecting the plot of hamlet into a modern day setting. This could not have been easily done. This play has always been meant for a medival/renaissance type setting, but I think this movie is as good or even better than the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet was more easily adaptable to a modern day setting than Hamlet. I think the director and all the writers  of this movie deserve kudos for thier effort, and I think that anyone who loves this great tradgedy such as I, should see this movie. Sure, it is hard to picture Bill Murray in a serious role such as Polonius, but I think he is doing a wonderful job in trying to branch out from comedies, although I think that automatically jumping into a tradgedy such as Hamlet is a little far-fetched. His acting was sort of monotonous though, and it sounded a little bit like he was reading the script for the first time. Out of all the roles, even Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, I thought that Liev Schrebiner as Laertes did the best job in portraying his role, with the possible exception of Kyle MacLachlan as Claudius. Schrebiner did wonderful in portraying Laertes' sorrow for Ophelia's death, and his anguish in coming back from France to find his father dead and his sister mad. The fight scene at the end dissapointed me when he pulled out the gun and shot Hamlet. What was the point of the poison tipped sword then? It was hardly dramatic. It is supposed to be symbolisim when Hamlet kills Claudius with his own poison. It really dissapointed me. I think they did a wonderful job portraying the rest of the scenes in the film, save a few, but overall worthy of your time, as it was mine.",990403200,4,1854,4.436950146627566
1264373,1,B00003CXEJ,"This is the absolute worst Shakespeare adaptation I have ever viewed; it was so horrid, I could only watch 45 minutes of it before I took it back to BlockBuster. The acting (?) was pitiful; Ethan Hawke meandered about the screen in what looked like a pointless daze.  Claire Daines spent 90% of her camera time in an open-mouthed, slackjawed stupor, apparently attempting to garner an Oscar for Best Fly-Catching Performance. Bill Murray acted like he was still singing in a lounge on Saturday Night Live. If you can even get past the acting (?), there's the problem of the story - as in - where did it go?  Quite a bit of the original storyline seems to be missing, making the title of ""Hamlet"" to be one of major deceit. Save your $3.50 and rent the Mel Gibson or Kenneth Branaugh version and let this one collect dust mites on the shelf.",989107200,2,840,4.483660130718954
1264374,3,B00003CXEJ,"Anachronistic versions of Shakespeare's plays have long been popular on the stage: there was Orson Welles' Fascist rendition of ""Julius Caesar"" and Stratford CT's ""Troilus and Cressida"" set during the American Civil War. I even saw a Wild West ""Taming of the Shrew"" one time. But up until recently, filmed versions of Shakespeare have been conventionally produced in 16th Century trappings, nothing that would have confused the Bard himself -- once he got over the shock of images on a tapestry moving and talking. This changed with a 1930's ""Richard III"" (1995) and a punk-rock ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1996). I liked both those films very much, and that's why I was eager to see Michael Almereyda's corporate America spin on ""Hamlet"". While I wasn't totally disappointed, I have to say that the movie is only about 50% successful. Most of the transition simply doesn't work, though there are some clever touches -- for instance, having Hamlet alter the e-mail on a lap top to doom Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Also, after rejecting Ophelia with ""Get thee to a nunnery"", his repetitions come through as voice-mail messages. (The play-within-a-play is, of course, a home movie Hamlet has spliced together.) The acting is spotty. In the title role, Ethan Hawke is somnambulistic; and Ophelia, never the brightest penny in Shakespeare, has never seemed more like a dumb bell than she does in Julia Stiles's spaced-out staring. (You're not certain if she goes mad or simply gets stoned.) As Polonius, Bill Murray dithers around like he's visiting David Letterman. The best performances come from Kyle Maclachlan as Claudius, Diane Venora (who has played Hamlet on the stage) as Gertrude, and Liev Schreiber as Laertes. Sam Shepard is the Ghost, and his meetings with his son are unusually intense, not to mention tactile. The picture as a whole is not particularly intense, and the ending seems anti-climatic (""Hamlet""??!!); but there are ideas and perspectives here to hold the attention of a Shakespeare fan looking for variety.",987724800,,2023,5.114803625377643
1264375,5,B00003CXEJ,"Director Michael Almereyda's version of ""Hamlet"" comes in as my top favorite and this is said after seeing Branagh, Olivier and even Gibson do it in films. Every once and awhile I have the wonderful experience of seeing a film on the right side, art side, of my brain.  I have no control over when this occurs but when it does, it pulls me right into the movie.  I oftentimes am fuzzy about film details after seeing it this way but the intensity of the experience more than makes up for it.  I saw this in our local art house theater and my right brain, the art side, was sucked right into the film.  I emerged at the end as if in a stupor or drugged; I was that bowled over.  Certainly setting the film in high tech New York City at the heartbeat of capitalistic consumerism worked well for me. Perhaps it set the mood for this work though and no one has ever brought out the mood of ""Hamlet"" as well as it was brought out here.  For once, I truly appreciated how depressed, alienated, and isolated Hamlet was from everything and everyone.  This has always escaped me in prior filmed versions. The rage is palpable as well throughout. That virtually all of the characters are desolate is well evoked too. Ethan Hawke (Hamlet), Sam Shepard (Father's Ghost), and Bill Murray (Polonius)are all brilliant.  I normally like the work of all three and this was no exception.  In fact, it is among the best work the three men have done. I realize that many viewers are comparing and contrasting this with Baz Luhrmann's modern remake of ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Although I really enjoyed that movie, I cannot say it was high art so cannot compare the two myself.  I really cannot think of any flaws and am excited about seeing it on DVD again.",987724800,7,1773,4.475155279503106
1264376,5,B00003CXEJ,"This movie was great.  Setting Hamlet in a Fortune 500 company (the Denmark corporation) was brilliant.  Almereyda's cleverness was illustrated not only by keeping the film modern while using Shakespeare's 17th century language but also by using modern sights to transmit some of the same ideas as the original play.  Having the famous ""to be or not to be"" soliloquy in the action section of Blockbuster was ingenious because it points out Hamlet's inner struggle with action versus thought, a major theme in the play.  I also thought that Shakespeare's language was not as large of a barrier to understanding the movie as some would make it out to be.  I felt that the lines were fairly easy to understand and were demonstrated by the action quite well.  Overall, I thought the movie followed the play quite well, and it should be enjoyed by bothShakespeare fans and those who are new to Shakespeare.",987552000,3,901,4.856209150326797
1264377,4,B00003CXEJ,"This is a interesting way to remake a Shakespeare.  Its modern-day adaptation is a lot better than the Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes version of Romeo and Juliet, although, unlike Romeo and Juliet, if you're not familiar with the play, it's hard to understand (I would know.)  It was good, had some really good performances, and I was able to pick up most of the stuff that was going on, but I wish that I'd looked over the Cliffs Notes for the play before seeing the movie.  There are a few things that didn't quite fit right in present day and a few things that aren't really explained very well (almost everything that happened to Ophelia confused me).  However, I still enjoyed most of the movie, but, again, I'd recommend having a basic knowledge of the play before seeing it.",970272000,5,785,4.585714285714285
1264378,2,B00003CXEJ,"I found this movie oddly distant and detached.  The actors are for the most part good and I was surprised how much I liked Ethan Hawke.  But for  some reason, the film never engaged me. I always felt ""outside""  the action.  Strangely enough, the Kenneth Branagh version, even though it  is twice as long, seemed shorter because it involved me.
The only  exceptions were the scenes involving Sam Shepard as Hamlet's father's  ghost.  Contrary to some portrayals, you can palpably feel his rage at his  brother's betrayal.  I wish the entire movie had been as good as his  scenes.",964742400,5,578,4.7272727272727275
7917239,4,B00003CXEJ,"There are few projects more difficult to take on than 'Hamlet'. You are bound to disappoint and probably piss off some people. That being said this is a very solid modern adaptation. I liked it much better than Kevin Branaugh's version. The production comes across as a real labor of love with a number well known New York actors doing their bit to take on 'The Bard'. It wasn't heavy handed or overly ambitious. If I was to compare to a recent Shakespeare production it would be Al Pacino's 'Looking for Richard' with the obvious difference being this is a finished film and not a collection of rehearsal footage.

I really like what Ethan Hawke did as Hamlet. He was like a snotty kid going through that self-maiming phase teens go through, now. He also got the pointedly clever and contrary nature of the dialogue. Julia Stiles captured that going through a suicidal phase thing, too. She really nailed how Ophelia felt trapped, how nobody would let her live her own life and how nobody cared about her happiness. In Stiles portrayal, Ophelia's suicide is the ultimate act of rebellion, against all of them. I've seen too many actresses play her like a space cadet and that's not the character, at all. The casting of Sam Shepard, Kyle Maclachlan and Bill Murray seemed inspired, though I thought Murray could've used a couple more takes. He should've been brilliant in the role and just never seems to get there.

It's not the best version ever but it did get a surprising number of things right and it's enjoyable to watch. I'm still holding out hope that some unknown 16 year old phenom will be cast in some Indy film and create the definitive version.",1524787200,,1658,4.6552901023890785

7917241,1,B00003CXEJ,"Well here we are folks. A production that does not know what it wants ""to be"". Usually I like to compare to other versions or the written play. In this case it is not worth the effort. When they updated Romeo and Juliet they at least had the innovation to change the dialog to match the situation as in ""West Side Story"" (1961). The combination of old English (Denmark) concepts added to NY. Reminds me of the housing project in Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"" (1949)... Adding a few Greek columns to make people comfortable.

Michael Almereyda talks like he sees the real way Hamlet is meant to be portrayed, then does this hatchet job on it and turns it into a bunch of Sound Bites.

If you like the actors then watch something that they did well and not forced into (probably for scale). If you like Hamlet then watch or read just about anything else and it won't be so polluted.

This is not a good example of getting of getting your peanut butter on my chocolate.

Overall, I enjoyed this one but I feel like Hawke's Hamlet is sort of subdued and some of what they cut were important, like, ""madness-builders."" The combination of the two factors resulted in the reactions of the king, of Polonius, etc seeming like overreactions. It was interesting to see how they near-seamlessly slid the story to 2000 NYC.

There have been renditions of the last scene that make me shiver and question how it is possible that Hamlet lives longer than the others, except his mother, when he was poisoned second.
Anyway, very nice adaptation. I laughed at the scene with Hamlet and Gertrude, the one where Polonius is hiding to listen to their conversation, because I found an editing mistake in the movie. I'm sure other people have noticed it, too, but I still found it rather funny.
