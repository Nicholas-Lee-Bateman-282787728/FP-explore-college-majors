4690022,4,B005G88M3S,"He's ideal for intermediate wood workers, Too repetitive for advanced wood workers, doesn't convey all techniques for beginners, some vital information is skipped over.",1425945600,2,168,6.041666666666667
4690023,5,B005G88M3S,"Tommy really has an ability to encourage newer woodworkers while also providing challenges for
the more advanced. Superb quality videos! Detailed paper plans come with every episode! I hope to eventually own every episode of every season!",1358726400,,238,5.45945945945946

8471413,5,B005G88M3S,One of my favorite woodworking shows.,1517875200,,37,5.333333333333333
8471414,4,B005G88M3S,My only complaint would be that the program is not long enough. Tommy does a road trip segment where he looks at historic pieces of furniture which eats up show time. Still good program just needs more time.,1449014400,,207,4.473684210526316
8471415,2,B005G88M3S,"I've always found Tommy Mac's stecato speech and cutesy approach distracting to the enjoyment of a woodworking show.  I've seen him on earlier TOH shows and he was easier to listen to.  Like some of the other reviews, I find it skips over a lot of detail and really doesn't have a smooth flow.  A New Yankee Workshop replacement this isn't, and there certainly have been better woodworking shows on.",1448150400,,399,4.671428571428572

8471419,5,B005G88M3S,"Rough Cut is fairly easy to follow for the woodworking part and the tool maintenance is also easy to follow.  However, some of the tools used are out of the price range of many viewers.

There are many episodes that only require lower priced tools.

I have learned what goes into making high quality items.",1444348800,,306,4.527272727272727
8471420,5,B005G88M3S,Tommy Mac always has a good show,1444176000,,32,3.7142857142857144
8471421,2,B005G88M3S,"Not as thorough as new Yankee workshop. Definitely steps left out of process. More for entertainment than for woodworkers.
But tommy is an amusing personality.",1443225600,,159,5.4
8471422,5,B005G88M3S,Good and to the  point.,1443225600,,23,3.6
