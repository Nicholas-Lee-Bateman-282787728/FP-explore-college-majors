7982398,4,B00008EYAN,"It's not a summer block buster filled with loads of action, special effects, or an earlier version of Paranormal Activity but if you are looking for a movie that will make you jump a couple time, giggle at the silliness of it, and enjoy it with your older children while teaching them about classic movies, this one is worth watching.",1294704000,6,334,4.583333333333333
7982399,1,B00008EYAN,My 2nd cousin is the lead actress in here. I like the first one but after viewing the second one and this one I 'm left to wonder what the point of ever making this piece of crap. The acting is terrible (especially her). In reality she's a ultra Btch. i think they were trying to tie the first one to this one and the idea died upon impact. what the hell were they thinking? my cousin is so untalented so you see the crap she was in. Pity the great american hero.,1258934400,,463,3.989247311827957
