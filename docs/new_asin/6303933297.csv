7856871,5,6303933297,"Terrific!  A very tough workout that leaves your legs shaking.  But carefully taught, so my post-knee-operation knee is fine, even with lots of squats.  All very slow and controlled movements.  A lot of focus on proper form.  I loved that there was both a male and female instructor.  This is one of my all-time favorite exercise routines.  I wish they'd re-issue it on DVD.",1359849600,2,374,4.75
7856872,5,6303933297,"great workout! starts with aerobics, then goes into a chair/squat routine then a floor routine, and ends with a cool-down. First time I did it, I couldn't finish.  Had to stop during the floor work.  But my buns were sore for days!  I like the fact that there are 3 trainers on this video (one for each segment).  Makes it much more interesting to watch. I've tried other bun workouts, but non made me as sore as this one! Plus, all you need is a chair and a floor mat.",1162944000,2,469,4.177777777777778
