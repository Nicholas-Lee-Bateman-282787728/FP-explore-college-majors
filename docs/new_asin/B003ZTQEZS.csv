8410935,5,B003ZTQEZS,"I thought I knew how to edit and create videos. I bought this video hoping to find a few tips that might be helpful. I was amazed to find that almost all (if not all) of the 201 video tips were techniques I didn't know.

The techniques were all explained step by step. I have watched the complete DVD two times, but the best part is I find that the index makes it easy to find just the tip I need when I have a video editing question.

Owning this video is like having a video editing expert sitting beside you ready to answer your questions.
