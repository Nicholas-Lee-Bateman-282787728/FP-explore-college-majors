I dearly want to watch it again and own it, but $43.00 is out of my price range.  I understand there are a few odd movies that Amazon has made for demand, but whew!  That's expensive.",1470441600,2,307,3.903225806451613
8019496,5,B00020HB2I,This movie was filmed in my home town. I had the actors staying in a motel I worked at. We met Scot Glen and many more of the actors. It never came out to a movie house so when I seen that you had it I had to buy it. Your service is always great. I have never had any bad order from you. I love Amazon,1463529600,,301,3.5074626865671643

8019499,2,B00020HB2I,"In this early 90's thriller, an FBI agent attempts to track down a hulking child-killer with inexplicable help from his young son, who predictably gets mixed up in the danger.

From once-great action director James Glickenhaus, who gave us 80's greats like ""The Exterminator"", ""The Soldier"" and ""Shakedown"", heaps this on us, arguably his worst action movie. Normally I can tolerate a lack of realism quite easily (it just goes with the territory), but this stupid flick just pushed it too far. And do you want to know why? It all goes back to the kid character, played, in a BAD choice, by the director's real-life son. This kid is an inexplicable genius, having created his own phone, home computer, etc. Stupid, stupid concept that definatley does not belong in this kind of movie. Additionally, he is one of the most insufferable child characters I've ever seen in any movie. He has about as much personality as tree stump, he's somehow more knowledgeable and well-informed of unsolved American murder cases than TRAINED FBI AGENTS, and somehow appears as a threat to villainous characters! Seriously, in one scene, he actually corners a bad guy into a corner in panic-stricken terror while yelling case details at the guy! It does not make ANY sense; this WOULD NEVER and could never happen!

Other problems include some equally stale acting from all actors aside from the always impeccable Scott Glenn, as well as some hilariously over-the-top melodramatic moments; the music tends to cheesily swell to a boil even during so much as a murder description.

Some points go to Scott Glenn, the hilarious melodrama and a few funny death scenes, namely one that involves deer antlers, but overall this lame and unrealistic mess is nothing more than an excuse for the director to force his EXTREMELY uninteresting kid into stardom (and failing), while all the while flipping the middle finger to his previously loyal action move fans.",1308787200,2,1934,4.981424148606811

8019501,4,B00020HB2I,"Slaughter of the Innocents stars Scott Glenn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Keep/dp/6300214346/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Keep</a>) as FBI Agent Stephen Broderick. After witnessing the wrongful execution of a 'convict' believed to be responsible for the brutal killing of a young girl that occurred years ago. In Mohab, after the execution, a store clerk gets killed and a young child is kidnapped. Both crimes mirror the child homicide. The only person that believes Broderick is his computer-whiz of a son Jesse (Played by Jesse Cameron-Glickenhaus, the director's son.) Stephen and his son later head out to Mohab to locate the real killer, who happens to be a schizophrenic who believes himself to be a new Noah, having built himself an Ark and having collected two of every living thing. And Jesse may be the next victim. Who will survive?

Overall, I think the movie is actually not that bad. It is ridiculous that Jesse is displayed as being smarter than any of the federal agents shown in this movie, but it's still funny, in an unintentional away. James Glickenhaus, who also helmed the awesome Peter Weller/Sam Elliott movie, Shakedown , did a good job with the direction and I also liked the score by Joe Renzetti.

Recommended.

DVD EXTRAS: The DVD is bare-boned but with a pretty good full frame presentation. Also, the DVD is out of print, but I was very lucky to find it for only $3 at BigLots!, so if you find this film at your local BigLots!, I would suggest buying it.",1255305600,,1534,5.103585657370518
