3511914,5,B001CFEC2Y,"Thank you thank you thank you Amazon for making this DVD available for purchase.  Ever since I first saw this on the discovery channel late one night I knew that I needed to own it.  I haven't read the book as yet, but that's my next stop.  They're even releasing this story as a full length movie into theaters.  As soon as I saw the preview I knew that it was this same story.  I rarely get scared to the point that I have to take a break from something, but this was one of the programs where I had to stop, put on the lights and take a break from the screen.  This gave me goose-bumps.  Take my advice, buy it and watch it.  You'll love it.  It's the best of the series!",1224547200,3,674,3.970149253731343

3511916,5,B001CFEC2Y,"A Haunting in Connecticut and A Haunting in Georgia were the two pilot episodes which led to the Discovery Channel series ""A Haunting"". Don't let that scare you away though because A Haunting in Connecticut is the best of the series, bar none. It's a story about a family who's teenage son gets cancer and to get him closer to his doctors they move to a house in Connecticut. When arriving at the house the parents, and eventually the children, realize that the house is a former funeral home, in which the previous owners still lurk in the basement!",1222128000,52,550,4.565656565656566
3511917,5,B001CFEC2Y,"I also love this one, just as much as a Haunting in Ga. like my other review. This one is the scarier of the two, though they both are pretty scary.  I actaully read the book it's based on (In a Dark Place) in H.S. needless to say, it scared the HELL out of me! So, I'll let you guess how scary the documentary is!  This one like a Haunting in Ga., also has real characters and a great story line. A family moves into a house that used to be funeral home,and strange things start happening to the boys who sleep in the basement. This one is so scary! Also, you finally get to see what the investigator saw when he comes to the house.  Unlike, the tv version where he just talks about what he saw. If you want a great ghost story, also order this one!  Warning: Don't show this to kids under 12, it will scare them too much!",1218672000,33,823,4.030674846625767

3511919,5,B001CFEC2Y,"This film is elsewhere listed as a ""docudrama.""  Not sure if it's a documentary or one of those films that seems like a documentary but is actually not.  Unclear whether the original people involved in the haunting were the ones interviewed with their faces obscured or whether that was a docu-DRAMA effect.  If this is a documentary, then I would say it is NOT for the faint of heart and was a very harrowing tale of one family's real-life nightmare.  If this is a docudrama, I would feel a bit ripped off, but gladly so, to think this stuff (QUITE different than the movie version in content and outcome) really happened.",1414281600,,623,4.585585585585585

3511923,4,B001CFEC2Y,"I bought this because I became hooked on the original ""A Haunting..."" series. These are described as fact-based episodes, and this one was creepy. So many things happened to this family. It also brings in the Warrens, who spent decades in this field (paranormal). It was good to see them portrayed here, and also get a glimpse of John Zaffis. If you've caught the SyFy series ""Haunted Collector"", you'd be surprised to see him portrayed here because when things got tough, he was out. But wouldn't you, if you encountered the scary happenings? To not give away the story, this episode, for me (with all things being relative), was the best. There was a movie based on this. It did not do well at the box office. The TV episode was actually much better. If you are a Warren fan, catch the movie ""The Conjuring"" as that also is a fact-based movie where they were involved.",1400457600,,870,4.583333333333333
3511924,5,B001CFEC2Y,Enjoyed the movie. Movie night was a good time for all the ages in the family. Have followed this on documentary as well.,1390348800,,121,4.304347826086956
3511925,3,B001CFEC2Y,"I purchased this DVD a while back for a topics class I teach at a small Liberal Arts college. The topic was the supernatural and folk stories. The Haunting in Connecticut was supposedly based on a true story. A family buys a new dream house that quickly turned into a nightmare when strange things began to happen and people began acting just a little strange, to put it mildly. It is a good haunting story, filled with all the evil spirits and dead bad people you might want in such a story. It is scary.....but! Like the Amityville Horror (the book was better than the movie by the way) a little research will bring you to other conclusions about the truthfulness of the story. In any case, it's worth watching... but not believing.",1390003200,,734,4.526315789473684
3511926,1,B001CFEC2Y,"OK, they got me on this one. I wasted my money-- ha ha ha. If you truly think this movie was scary, then you'd crap your pants if you watched the movies I've seen. I've heard this true story before. The makers of this TV movie ruined it for me. The very first event was totally unbelievable. The mother began to mop the floor.  First of all, nobody dips a mop in a bucket then goes straight to the floor without wringing out the excess water. Secondly, as she mops with all that water she has just put on the floor the water turns to pure blood. She looks down to see she's standing in a huge puddle of blood, and she just keeps mopping wondering where the blood came from??? Any normal person would have gasped and yelled ""WTF---!!!"" and then threw down the mop and ran out of the house. Give me a break! The only thing scary about this movie is that so many people found it to be scary!!",1386460800,,889,4.138728323699422
3511927,4,B001CFEC2Y,"This documentary is better than most horror movies/TV shows. It's genuinely creepy during certain scenes, especially scenes in the basement. This documentary is well made. I recommended it to anyone.",1385769600,,199,5.666666666666667
3511928,5,B001CFEC2Y,"While this may seem to be just a documentary, it's actually more frightening than the movie that it spawned! What I liked about it was that members of the real family (who were blacked out and hidden from view) provided some of the commentary on the movie, plus it features an appearance by Lorraine Warren and that's never a bad thing! In a nutshell -- a mom Karen Parker moves her and the rest of her family into a house that was a converted funeral parlor so that she could be closer to the hospital where her son Paul is receiving chemo treatments. Over time, they start to realize that the house is haunted and as things get worse, they start to look for answers wherever they can find them because the demons that seem keep to the basement have set their sets on Paul and he may end up being lost forever. When they reach out to the Ed and Lorraine Warren for help, things REALLY get interesting! Oh, it may only be a 94 minute documentary, but it hooks you pretty much from the get-go and doesn't rely on CGI effects to keep you interested. Plus, Anthony Call's narration is perfect! If you enjoyed the movie, give this a try and you might find yourself liking this more! It's definitely a well done thriller!",1383955200,,1216,4.384955752212389
3511929,5,B001CFEC2Y,"To me these days Horror movies just aren't scary like 70's, 80's, & 90's Horror movies that a lot of us has grown up with.
I saw this before the theatrical version and it is MUCH better! This is the TRUE STORY in documentary form.
This movie is CREEPY it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and NO movie has done that in years!
Halloween is on the way and if you are looking for some Horror movies that will actually scare you and give you chills then this movie is a MUST have!",1379030400,,489,3.9494949494949494

I think Hollywood could take a few lessons from these people,
I have seen the movie ""A Haunting In Connecticut"" and I can honestly say that there is absolutely no way that that garbage compares to this,
half of the crap in that one (from what I know after seeing this one) I can tell you there was no way in hell that it was based on the same events,
I say it's in a league of it's own,

3511934,5,B001CFEC2Y,Love this show and the series. This has to be by far one of the scariest and most intense episodes i have ever seen. Especially when you see that demonic spirit which haunts the basement is pretty scary looking when paul goes to confront the entity.

3511936,3,B001CFEC2Y,"This is just the TV show that was on the Discovery Channel. I thought it was a movie or a documentary. I remember being disappointed when I saw the actual show on TV, not only because the intensity of the haunting did not really come through, but also because the actors were so bad. I can't return it now because it's my own fault that I bought it. Lesson learned.",1309910400,,365,4.228571428571429
3511937,5,B001CFEC2Y,"This show came before the movie.  I absolutely love the aerial photograph in the opening scenes.  I also love how these parents are typical of a lot of parents.  They simply don't listen when their children are telling them what they are experiencing in the house.  How incredibly frustrating it must be to grow up with parents who don't listen to you.

This plot takes in you & scares the heck out of you.  New Dominion Pictures needs to pick this series back up!!!  If you like the series, buy the entire DVD set like I did.  My only complaint, is I bought the entire series but this episode was not among the DVDs.  ""A Haunting in Georgia"" was there though?",1283385600,,660,4.3884297520661155

documentary was sure well done,in my opinion.in the chills
department,it rates almost off the charts.there were a few scenes where
my blood ran cold.the narrator(who also does the narration for the
F.B.I. Files)has the perfect voice for this kind of program.a word of
warning.if you should watch this late at night,you may have trouble
sleeping,as it's much more terrifying than most horror movies,due to a
much higher degree of realism,in terms of how it looks and how it's
shot.that's just my opinion,of course.for me,A Haunting in Connecticut

Not only do they make their kids sleep in the basement right next to the embalming room, but they take out the lightbulbs so the kids can't turn on the lights at night if they get scared.  I don't blame the spirits for running them out of the house.  And it was not even their house, they were just renting it, so why the heck didn't they just move to an apartment??  Not scary, not intersting, and didn't even seem factual.  No record of this or pictures even after they had some team of ghost hunters come in and take all kinds of photos etc.  Don't buy it.",1255392000,,592,4.1946902654867255

The poor boy has cancer, and so the mother finds a big house in Connecticut, close to his hospital where he receives treatment. The house is very cheap, and she soon finds out why. Because it was a former funeral home. The boys move into the basement, where all the hauntings mostly happen. It soon posesses the boy with cancer, who acts very strange with his family and starts attacking.

3511945,5,B001CFEC2Y,"I love the Haunting series produced by the Discovery Channel, and have all Seasons 1-4. The show is well-produced and most of the stories not only ring true but have the ability to really creep viewers out.

Of all the stories portrayed in the series, I'd have to say ""A Haunting in Connecticut"" stands out as one of the scariest stories. In this story, the Parker family moves into their supposedly dream home, a break they desperately need considering one of their children, a son, suffers from cancer. Instead, the family is beset by spooky goings-on, and discover to their horror certain strange artifacts in the house such as coffin keys and a huge freezer in the cellar. They realise that the house used to be a funeral home, and have to cope with the hauntings. They finally seek the help of Edward and Lorraine Warren, the same couple that investigated another haunted house that came to be known as the Amityville horror.

The docu-drama is credibly done with effects that are average, yet manage to creep out viewers. The story is also something that doesn't seem unbelievable, there is a ring of truth to it, and though the movie version seems to sensationalize the story, this docu-drama effectively captures the family's nightmare and plight. The viewer comes to sympathize with the family, especially given that they already have enough on their plate - a sick son and added on to that, a house that is inhabited by supernatural entities. Highly recommended, and while you're at it, I'd recommend getting Haunting Seasons 1-4, especially since it is currently being heavily discounted here on Amazon.",1247875200,2,1614,4.886861313868613
3511946,5,B001CFEC2Y,"This documentary is one of the scariest haunting stories of which I've heard, and is probably the best episode in Discovery's haunting series. I will warn you that there are spoilers ahead.

The premise of the story that the Snedeker family needs to move closer to where the oldest son, Stephen, is being treated for cancer. The family thinks they have found the answer to their prayers when they find a large home that has just been remodeled that is being leased for a very reasonable price. However, they soon learn the reason for the bargain. The house is a former funeral home. However, with the expense of the son's cancer treatment weighing heavily on the family budget, the Snedekers are unable to afford breaking their lease and moving to yet another house. Demons soon invade their domicile - or they invade the demons' domicile, depending on how you look at it - until the supernatural detectives, the Warrens, are called in and with the help of an exorcism, restore peace to the household.

Just as much as fright, though, I felt a great deal of anger at the Snedekers as parents. For one thing, Mr. Snedeker seems to believe that the size of his electricity bill is more important than the mental health of a child recovering from cancer since he removes all of the light bulbs from the basement bedroom so that Stephen can no longer sleep with the lights on. Then he forces the boy to continue sleeping in this bedroom in spite of his tales of horror of being tormented by apparitions coming from the former embalming room adjacent to his basement bedroom. He does this in spite of the fact that he and his wife have both personally been the victims of attacks and witnesses of various manifestations of the house's spirits. Afterwards, in despair, the boy just gives in to the demons' collective will, manifesting in more and more bizarre behavior until he finally attacks a visiting cousin. How Mrs. Snedeker could have invited this young niece into her home in the first place just because she wanted the companionship and help around the house, having witnessed firsthand the mayhem that the house's demons can cause, as well as her son's deteriorating mental state, is a wonder to me.

I have read an interview with the author of a book on this haunting, which tracks this documentary closely, and he paints both the Warrens and the Snedekers in a very unflattering light in that interview. He basically says that he does not really believe the Snedekers' stories, since even the Warrens themselves told the author that they think that all of their clients are crazy including the Snedekers. Plus, apparently there was considerable drug and alcohol abuse going on in the Snedeker household and the family members would never tell the same story twice. The author only went through with writing his book because he was already legally obligated to do so.

However, even if the account told in this documentary is total fiction, it is well told and frightening fiction and I highly recommend it. It is much better than the movie which suffers from a real lack of imagination given the subject matter.",1247875200,,3117,4.7560073937153415
3511947,5,B001CFEC2Y,A Haunting was one of the best series ever made for television and this was by far one of the scariest episodes Based on the testimony of a family that lived in a haunted house.,1247356800,,177,4.085714285714285
3511948,5,B001CFEC2Y,This is perhaps my wife's favorite documentary on ghosts.  I've seen it with her a few times now and its always very enjoyable.  The production value is top notch and definitely gets you hooked.  Easily the best of series.,1246406400,,222,4.641025641025641
3511949,3,B001CFEC2Y,"This picture left me with a sense of being haunted but for reasons one might not suspect.  First I paid threatre price to see it.  Second I was told by the person who accompanied me that I dozed off for a few seconds while watching it. While I don't totally believe this it might be true as it lacked much to define it as frightening or scary.

Given this was passed off as horror (although it had PG13 rating) I was left haunted a little by my own mild embarrassment at being perhaps a tad rude perhaps to my theatre companion and the filmakers that there horror frightner could induce me to a state of negative consciousness for even a few seconds.

The basic premise is fine as far as premises go. Which with this film was pretty short.  A son sticken with cancer and a family renting a house near a hospital while the eldest son gets chemotherapy. The home has a past. It is former mortuary where years of inconceivable acts occurred. Good start. Virgina Madsen, one my favorite actresss, was the stalwart mother holding the family togther in a role she has played so well before. However even her talent seems mostly wasted here. The opening was the most credible part for her.

The begining catches us for a few minutes. It is a teaser.  It fools us into thinking heh this might be interesting. Madsen talks to the TV camera about the horror of her family story. At the end she comes back to do a wrap up and this is  a nice way to tie everything into a package. Kudos to the filmakers doing this.

However, films are more than beginning and endings neatly tied. Because yes Virginia, films do have a middle and this picture has no Santa Clause. It was a shame to watch Madsen along with notables such as Elias Koteas (the priest)  simply appear to be wasted talent going through the motions as opposed to acting. Kyle Gallner gives a fair performance, portraying his build to insanity. So the acting was not really the main problem. It is Hard to rise like an eagle for any of these actors when the script is basically a turkey.

After the initial interest of opening, things descend to the basement literally and figuratively. For some reason the son with cancer decides to reside in the cellar while getting his treament. What follows is a  muddled nightmare of crashing banging,and jolting, in a filmic style best decribed as a train after it has left the rails but still tryinmg to stay upright.  It  bumps bangs, grinds, and crashes from scene to scene supported by an equlally jolting background cast replete with shreaking, wailing violins and other sounds designed to make you jump and of course appropriate visuals of barbecued corpses and other wrapped dead bodies that reminded me of footage from other films.

There were some interesting ectoplasmic effects and even a priest who reminded me vaguely of the Exorcist. Interesting scene near the end of a faded shot of the cancer son in a graveyard. Is he dead? It jolts back to a scene of firefighters doing CPR on sons chest. The films trys to attempt some climax as struggling to make us ask the big life question. Is this check out time? Will cancer son live or succumb to his illness and the demon house which is actually keeping him alive.

In this moment of attempted ""climatic moment"" we should feel something. Most would hope on some level he makes it but from a film perespective we are not given much to reason to care.  Throughout cancer son's trial with chemotherapy the film provid little ffor us to hang on to. The son might as well have had the  misery of psorsias. Even approrpriate horror film stock scenes of vomiting did not make us feel anymore empathy. Add to this a pseudo tragic picture of an alcoholic father in some rage to turn of lightbulbs and it the result had me thinking maybe he was in the wrong film trying to save the world from an energy crisis.  The director seemed to forget we might want to care about the characters.

Insconstenecies in the story are for others to note. Why didn't the family just leave? Who knows. In fact, what this picture really needed to work for me was clowns. Clowns are scary. A large set of nasty clown figures in  masks screaming and running wild would have topped things off. So that makes no sense? This assume the film itself makes sense overall.

Haunting uses a cliche hook in the credits saying it based on a true story. Yes it based on a real life family. So what. As one writer noted listening or watching the family who experienced the real terror might have been more interesting and apparently according to reviews the original story available on several big box sites as a bio documentrary is quite well done. Truth stranger than fiction perhaps? Well this film is high in the strange quotient.

Fright quotient of Haunting is mininmal. Music was maybe the sum total of films creep quotient. Although it was ""startling"" when a pile of dishes broke loudly, among other things banging around. However someone sitting in front of the theater was talking or arguing loudly on a cell phone jolted me more than the the picture. Maybe todays audience equates being jolted by loud banging and jumpy edits as the hallmarkmark of good horror.

My rating system gives it 3 stars. Two for Viginia Madsen doing well with what she had to work with and 1 for Gallner) and 2 yawns.

A haunting cinematic vista of schlock and jolt.

3511955,5,B001CFEC2Y,I love this series very much but must say that this episode is the best one ever made.  Discovery never reruns this episode but does all the others.  I guess this was the first for the series so that is why it was never rerun.  6 years after seeing it I still remembered it and when I found it here I got it.  Just this year they made a full movie based on this story.  Not sure how the movie was but this episode is great!,1242345600,2,423,3.872093023255814
3511956,5,B001CFEC2Y,"This documentary was the first one I watched in ""A Haunting"" series from the Discovery Network.  I remember I caught it by accident years ago and after being pulled into it by the narrator's creepy voice and captivating true story along every twist and turn, I was actually creeped out in my own house to walk down the hall, go into the basement and turn off the lights for the rest of the night.  And I don't get scared that easily!  The second one in the series wasn't nearly as good, but ""A Haunting In Connecticut"" is absolutely a must-see.  It's better than the movie in my opinion.  It has interviews with the people who actually endured the events.  This documentary shows that the truth is usually scary enough on its own without having to go 'Hollywood'.  Plus, the younger actors in the dramatizations are actually pretty good.  Don't miss it.  I own ""A Haunting: Season 3"" now, there are some episodes in there that rival this one, but this one is one of the best.",1242086400,2,975,4.494318181818182
3511957,5,B001CFEC2Y,"A Haunting in Connecticut was the first of two pilot episodes for Discovery Channel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Haunting-Seasons-1-4/dp/B001BCUB46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Haunting - Seasons 1-4</a>, one of the best paranormal television series of all time.  The story documented herein is perhaps more fascinating now than it was when the program first aired back in 2002, as the story - and the controversy surrounding it - has received renewed attention coinciding with the release of the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Haunting-in-Connecticut-Unrated-Special-Edition/dp/B0027P9S0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Haunting in Connecticut (Unrated Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;based on the same story of ghostly infestation.  While I have not yet seen the new feature film, a quick perusal of the plot summary makes it quite clear that it differs significantly from original eyewitness accounts - in other words, this program is well worth watching even if you've seen the 2009 horror film.  On the other hand, this documentary actually tells a significantly watered-down version of the original story.  I find that disappointing yet understandable given the deeply personal nature of some of the reported events and the fact that the credibility of the entire story had come strongly in to question by 1999, when Ray Garton, the man contracted to write the story of the haunting in the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-a-Dark-Place/dp/0440216982/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In a Dark Place</a>, publicly impugned the integrity of the family as well as world-famous investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.  Whether the whole story is truth or fiction, though, I think all would agree that it makes a hell of a good story.

This particular haunting is particularly troubling because it involves the demonic targeting of a young teenager battling cancer.  The Parker family (as it is referred to here) moved from New York to Connecticut so that their cancer-stricken son Paul would be close to his doctors; desperate to find some place for their fairly large family to stay, they jumped at the chance to land this large and relatively inexpensive home.  Only when they moved in did they discover that the place used to be a funeral parlour.  The parents really aren't concerned about this, though - even when three of their children begin reporting frightening sights and sounds.  It's bad enough that both parents refuse to believe their children's stories, but it's frustrating to say the least to watch them blame Paul for putting the idea of ghosts in his siblings' heads.  Whether they believed him or not, I can't understand why they would force an obviously-frightened young man fighting a life-and-death struggle with cancer to stay in a room that scares him so much; the father even removes the light bulbs from the room.  This sets Paul up for great suffering indeed.  Of course, once the parents finally get a sample of what has been tormenting all of their children, they race to find a solution to the problem, eventually turning to demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren for help.  The Warrens and their research team are soon treated to a range of evidence that convinces them that a strong demonic presence abides in the ill-fated house.

The truth of this haunting is very much in doubt, but the events recreated in this program are pretty extraordinary and, in some cases, quite distinct and unusual.  This isn't a program you would want to let your kids watch just before going to bed, as bad dreams are made of the phenomena on display here.  A Haunting in Connecticut is the equivalent of a regular A Haunting episode on steroids, making full use of its extended running time of 94 minutes.

I am very happy with this purchase, and the delivery time was very quick. If you have seen the 2009 film, you MUST see this!!! This is how it really happened!!!",1241568000,,292,4.232142857142857
3511959,1,B001CFEC2Y,"I was surprised at how boring and non-scary this was.  They move into a former funeral home..........of course, embalming equipment all over the basement is a little creepy.  The kids want to sleep with the light on. so what? lots of kids do.  The parents (especially the mother) are already predisposed to believing something creepy is happening (even though the narrator tries to tell us the opposite).  It was the parents' thirst for a really big house that made them choose a former funeral home over something more modest, then they decide not to tell the kids about it. I couldn't stay awake.....might be a good for a group of pre-teens having a slumber party....",1240790400,3,669,4.791304347826087
3511960,5,B001CFEC2Y,I found this story very interesting and was glad to be able to watch this video before seeing the movie version of it.

3511961,5,B001CFEC2Y,I got this becuase I was curious about the movie. I hope the movie is as creepy as the real life story. Recommended for any true ghost story fan.,1239494400,2,145,4.0344827586206895
3511962,1,B001CFEC2Y,"Poorly filmed, poorly scripted account of a ""true"" haunting that, miraculously, has zero recorded proof of its existance. About as frightening as a sack of baby rabbits. The film is made all the more unbearable by the constant recounting of the events the viewer HAD JUST WATCHED; this occurs about every ten to twenty minutes.",1239148800,,327,4.963636363636364
3511963,5,B001CFEC2Y,After viewing the movie of the same title at the theater and now receiving it from amazon- this dvd is much more accurate to the truth behind the haunting! This movie also gives credit to great paranormal investigators/ demonologists: Lorraine and Ed Warren as well as John Zaffis. Even though the 100% truth is only found in the book - this is the closet to reality and gives credit where credit is due for helping this family!!,1238976000,,429,4.584415584415584
3511964,5,B001CFEC2Y,"Though the DVD quality wasn't as good as the original Discovery Channel broadcast, this documentary was still good enough to make me keep the lights on for a few nights.  I saw the original episode a few years back, just out of luck I happened to catch it in it's entirety.  Now, I'm already a coward who jumps at my own shadow, but I can't help enjoying horror films and paranormal programs.  Most scary movies today don't move me at all.  There's a jump here or a gasp there, but nothing like what I experienced from this documentary.  This was enough to scare me for a few days.  I honestly slept with the lights on for about three nights straight, possibly longer!  I don't think I've been that shaken from a film in my entire life.  Coincidentally my best friend and I had been discussing the television show ""A Haunting"" a year or so later and it happens that he too had seen this documentary and found it just as disturbing as I did!  We both still remembered the fine details, even though we both had only seen it once.  That's unheard of for me.  So of course, I had to buy the DVD.  It's not as scary the second time around, but maybe that's because I know when to cover my eyes.  Hahaha.
Even my parents enjoyed this DVD, and they usually can't stand the horror movies or paranormal programs I like.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good deep down scare that will stay with you for a while.",1236038400,4,1415,4.3143939393939394
3511965,5,B001CFEC2Y,"This extra-long pilot episode for the ""A Haunting"" series was the reason I made ""A Haunting"" one of my must watch TV shows.  This episode is far scarier than any of the other episodes, and its presentation is top-notch!  The poor teenage boy in the story was forced to sleep in the basement near the former embalming table!!! This is a must have, and it is not included with the Season 1 and 2 set so buying it seperate here is the best way to get it.",1231545600,,451,4.172413793103448
3511966,5,B001CFEC2Y,"Anyone who has ever read ""In a Dark Place"" will recognize the story of the Parker family and their terrifying 3-month stint in a former funeral home/morgue.  This video version is very good.  As a person who actually grew up in former funeral home, I can testify truthfully that they are not all terrifying and infested with demons!  (Ghosts, yes, but demons......no.)

As with the book, I have a hard time believing completely some of the details as being factual.

There are some things about the story that make me ask ""huh?""  For instance, even if you didn't believe in ghosts and spirits, would you really put your children down in the basement and expect them to sleep in what used to be a morgue?  And when they began running up the stairs night after night, screaming and crying and reporting that they saw apparitions, wouldn't a parent feel enough sympathy to let them sleep on the pull-out sofa in the living room, instead of continuing to insist that they return to the basement aka morgue, to sleep?

I find it to be rather cruel myself.  I mean, why didn't the parents take the basement bedroom and let the boys sleep upstairs?  It is tantamount to abuse, in my opinion.

And no matter how much debt you had, would you still sleep in a place that molested its inhabitants?  In a place that didn't allow you a simple nights rest?  I mean, wouldn't Motel 6 look like a pretty good deal at some point?  I wonder about those things.

So there are parts of the story that don't really add up.  But overall, it's a great film based on a really scary book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who feels like being scared for a few hours!",1228435200,32,1644,4.448160535117057
3511967,3,B001CFEC2Y,"To start with, I love all of the ""A Haunting"" shows shown on Discovery Channel.  My only gripe with this one episode is the poor DVD transfer. The DVD is very dark in many areas when compared to the broadcast version shown on The Discovery Channel. They could have done a much better job in transfering the show onto DVD. The dark areas on the DVD are much brighter on the broadcast version of the show. Still worth getting. The Haunting shows look wonderful on Discovery Channel HD.
