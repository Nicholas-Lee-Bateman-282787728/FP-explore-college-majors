8016368,5,B0001US8CQ,"Great movie, plus Rider and Shiloh Strong are my 2 favorite actors.  I like Christine Lakin too from ""Step by Step.""  Wasn't familiar with the other actress in the movie, but she did a great job as well.  The movie played nicely, and I was happy with the transaction.  Thank you.",1365465600,,279,4.411764705882353
8016369,4,B0001US8CQ,"I was surprised about this movie.  It is surprisingly good for the very few uses of bad language.  Also, even though the one girl smokes and wanted to lose her virginity in the forest, she has a very nice talk about her belief in God.  It isn't preachy and doesn't favor one theology over another; just a simple belief in God and that He cares for us.  Unfortunately, there is way too much teen smoking.  This is obviously a 'beginner actor' movie, but even the biggest stars today started in movies much like this one.  I liked the movie for its presentation of the different kids viewpoints on their situation, and their individual lives in general.",1168560000,,651,4.568965517241379
8016370,5,B0001US8CQ,"I didn't know what to expect when I started this film, but by the end I really found the characters endearing and the dialogue was very funny.  I laughed out loud several times and even shed a little tear at the end.  If you enjoy witty banter with some heartfelt moments, you ought to give this movie a look.",1090886400,4,309,4.220338983050848
8016371,5,B0001US8CQ,"First let me say beware of some of the posted reviews.  They are referring to the 1983 film Eyes of Fire and have nothing to do with what this movie is about.  (I have notified Amazon, but there are no ""supernatural phantoms"" or ""mud people"" in this movie)
Eyes of Fire:Feel the Heat is a movie also known as Buck Naked Arson, as well as Grad Night.  It stars Ryder Strong, Christine Lakin, Azure Skye, and Shiloh Strong.
The movie is about 4 high school graduates who stop in the forest on the way to a rave and end up in the middle of a ranger's arson investigation after forest in their area is caught on fire.  Most of the movie takes place in the ranger's station and is constructed very well with flashbacks as each student tells his/her side of the story.
I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The story had well placed humor, a good story line (even if someone predictable at times), and actually left you wondering what really happened through most of the film.
Despite the fact it was likely done on a relatively low budget, the movie did not suffer because of it.
This movie comes highly recommended.",1089504000,12,1116,4.450980392156863
8016372,5,B0001US8CQ,"If you love Ryder Strong, you'll love him even more after watching 'Eyes of Fire'. VERY funny & entertaining the whole way through! I'm ready for a sequel!",1085011200,5,155,4.571428571428571
