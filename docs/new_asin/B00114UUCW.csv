8240328,5,B00114UUCW,"Tarrant County Jury Services shows highlights from ""12 Angry Men"" to impress on you how important it is. However I have already watched this movie several times. Even thought I know the outcome it is interesting to speculate as to what the message each juror is trying to express.

Of course just about all of Henry Fonda's performances are exceptional and in this one you see him sweat. The real tension in this movie is the interaction between the jurors. Even thought you mostly focus on Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, there is not a wasted juror as you can see from the cast list.",1526688000,,582,4.490566037735849

8240330,5,B00114UUCW,"In the 1957 movie version of 12 ANGRY MEN, Joseph Sweeney and George Voskovec reprise their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STUDIO-ONE/dp/B002VRNJTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STUDIO ONE</a>&nbsp;roles of Jurors #9 and #11. Voskovec portrays the European watchmaker and Sweeney the elderly man whose last minute insight brings the panel's deliberations to a successful close. Sidney Lumet directed both the live CBS-TV broadcast and this Oscar nominated film.

""12 Angry Men"" is a still relevant study of what is potentially the weakest link in the American justice system: the jury. Although charged by a judge to retire for deliberations with an open mind, as this broadcast shows, most enter that jury room already decided on a defendant's guilt or innocence. As we see here, an individual's background, history and prejudices often hinder the ability to consider any evidence but those pieces supporting his own preconceived conclusions.

Thus, once the door is locked behind them, eleven men on this ""unbiased"" panel immediately declare a young minority defendant guilty of murdering his father. One lone juror holds out, believing that some discussion is necessary before sending a man to his death. As they delve into the facts and testimony of this ""open and shut"" case, one by one the other deliberators find reasonable doubt, and what had seemed a landslide toward conviction is no longer so certain. Along the way, idiosyncracies of these men are revealed that are not always flattering to some, yet the wheels of justice turn despite human failings and perhaps miraculously, a fair verdict is reached.
