8467597,5,B005DUHRA8,"This was done, with (the late) Michael Ruppert, and others on The History Channel about a year after he did ""Collapse.""  If you can find a copy, BUY IT!",1400457600,5,152,4.241379310344827
8467598,5,B005DUHRA8,"This documentary is, without doubt, the best presentation of its kind.  Enough with the superstitious stuff, now it's time to be scared by real science and logic.  Humans are pushing the planet to its limit.

Don't expect governments to react until it's too late.  They see their job as keeping power in their own hands and a sure way to do that is to tell you that everything is fine.  It isn't.

I taught at the university from the mid-70s through the 90s and considered it my responsibility to make sure my students knew what they were coming up against.  This is the only DVD I have encountered that will present you with various dire scenarios, one or more of which, will play out in the not too distance future.",1327449600,5,717,4.469230769230769
8467599,5,B005DUHRA8,"This History Channel Special is a two hour look at the many and various problems contemporary society faces: From nuclear terrorism, to financial crisis, to problems of energy and food production.  The panel, consisting of former business leaders, scholars and authors, generally hold that even though many of the problems are being ignored or brushed aside, as time moves on are actually building in strength.  One of the key issues is that, especially now that we are in the computer age, we are increasingly inside a 'global society' which is a phenomenon that can be helpful, as well as it can be hurtful.  The analysis is very compelling, and offers a view of the future not as rosy as we would like, which is often due to our self confidence, and failure to properly critique ourselfs.  So this program does that, and very well.  Highly recommended; one of the finest programs I have had the pleasure of watching on the History Channel.",1318636800,5,942,4.790123456790123
