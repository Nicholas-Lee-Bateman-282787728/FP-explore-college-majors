5233615,5,B00915G6SU,I'm so glad VOD finally got the series! I'd much rather stream videos than have to download them from iTunes.,1350864000,2,109,4.5
5233616,5,B00915G6SU,"I love Criminal Minds, the characters, the situations and the way it makes you reevaluate the world around you at time. But I am reserving judgement on the new character until I have seen more.",1350864000,,193,4.542857142857143
5233617,5,B00915G6SU,"This episode has a really good story, great writing, and I really liked the new agent. I believe they picked a good actress to play SSA Agent Alex Blake. I also loved the scenes between Agent Blake and Chief Strauss. I think this season will be another good one",1350777600,,261,4.346938775510204
5233618,3,B00915G6SU,"Crimanal minds is my favorite show. This was a good episode but not one of the best. I totally miss Emily Prentiss. She added another character to the family.

5233620,4,B00915G6SU,"This was a great episode, I almost didn't recognize  Kim Wayans or McKenzie Phillips, they were great.  However I miss Emily, The new girl is good, but she's not Emily Prentiss, I love the show because they have strong women that don't have to show skin to get notice or play super cop women, they seem real. I was happy that they brought JJ back.  I like agent Hotchter.",1350259200,48,371,4.3478260869565215
5233621,5,B00915G6SU,"I am so happy that we are entering a new season and by the end of the season premier, it looks to be a good one. After the 100TH episode with The Reaper, it has been a bit downhill and anti-climatic. The Unsubs rarely last more than an episode and just have not been quite as interesting as before. I know with changes in characters, who's leaving?, who's coming back? that may have impacted the writing. The addition of Jeanne Tripplehorn does not fit in as of yet. Reading comments on other sites, many are in agreement. I do not get, or welcome her character's impact on the show. We already have The Smart One, and though he is brilliant, he is more than likable. The new co-star comes across as ""bitchy"", we already have that with Strauss. Jeanne Tripplehorn has seen better days, so why would they attempt to replace the irreplaceable with her? Prentiss taking over Elle went smoothly. Agent Rossi fit right in. She does not. It doesn't seem that the shows returning characters accept or like her, how can we? Other than that, the creepy part at the end of this episode promises a great season and I am looking forward to it. If something happens to the new agent and she no longer comes back, I would not be saddened.",1348704000,2,1224,4.444444444444445

5233862,5,B00915G6SU,great series! Love this series!  Although definitely not kid friendly it is a great adult treat. The main characters are super engaging and you find you can get really emotionally invested. The writers and producers are genius and make each episode its own story. You can easily walk into the series at any point and get enough content information to know what is going on and not feel completely lost. The BAU team are thoroughly entertaining and their character plots are quite thought provoking. The content can be graphic at times but not over the top. There are multiple story lines going simultaneously but it's done eloquently so you get just enough critical detail to remember from episode to episode. When applicable they give review segments before the episode so viewers can get caught up on crucial details from previous episodes that are relevant to what you are about to watch further deepening your understanding of the narrative. You leave each episode emotional and excited about what is going to happen next. It's easy to get wrapped up in the mind and workings of the BAU. I love that the focus isn't targeted exclusively at the murderers but rather the development of the profile and thought process of the information analysis as well as relationship between main characters. It's engaging and thought provoking. I can't wait to watch more!,1458000000,2,1361,4.943231441048035

Criminal Minds is one of my favorite TV shows out there and I fell behind on some episodes and I could't find any of the episodes on CBS that I was looking for. So I turned to amazon. Amazon had every single episode that I was looking for. This was so easy to buy and use. Also, the picture quality was amazing. I was watching it on my laptop and it looked like I was watching it on my flatscreen tv!

Blake is refreshing in that she's super intelligent, although she may be less ""hot"" than Elle, Seaver, J.J, or Prentiss.  (As we know by now, Blake, too, will get the axe.)  I give this season 5 stars because I try not to compare any one season with the others.

I love the message it gives throughout the whole episode, and how it shows the difficulty that can come to some people who are homosexual, but also how the kindness of a person, and a little positive help from a person, can help change a person and really help them in a positive way. This episode also provides me with perhaps a little hope of my own to help me, and perhaps to help me see that there is at least a possibility to help others who struggle.",1412985600,,636,4.178861788617886

Insensitivity, Part One
by Charles R. Swindoll

Galatians 6:2, 10

My kids pulled a fast one on me one Christmas years ago. They teamed up, pooled their vast financial resources, and bought me a little motto to set on my desk. It was more than cute . . . it was convicting. In bold, black letters it read:

DIETS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THICK AND TIRED OF IT

At first you thmile . . . then it makes you thad. Especially if you're not thick of being thick!

There's another thickness that's just as bad. We could call it an ""inner thickness."" I'm referring to insensitivity . . . being unaware, out of touch, lacking in insight, failing to pay attention. The Hebrew Scriptures occasionally mention those who are foolish and simple, as in the book of Proverbs (1:2233). The original term means ""thick, dull, sluggish."" It's the picture of mental dullness, one who is virtually blind toward others . . . failing to feel others' feelings, think others' thoughts, sense others' needs.

Professional insensitivity is painfully common. To some physicians you're case number twenty-three today . . . a body, weighing so much . . . a mouth, saying words . . . a gall bladder needing removal.

And how about insensitive teachers or speakers? Talk about painful! A block of information is dumped into your ears from their mouths. Whether it's interesting or well thought through is unimportant. The whole episode is about as memorable as changing a flat.

And have you come across an insensitive salesperson lately? You can feel the thickness. Your exasperation leads to gross impatience . . . and then, finally, confusion. You're not sure if the individual understands only Swahili . . . or is recovering from advanced lockjaw.

Perhaps the most tragic shades of insensitivity occur in the home. Between mates, to begin with. Needs in the heart of a wife long to be discovered by her husband. She hides them until an appropriate moment . . . but it never arrives. He's ""too busy."" What cursed words! ""Other things are more important."" Oh, really? Name one.

A husband wrestles with a matter down deep . . . in the ""combat zone"" of his mind. Lacking perception, the preoccupied wife drives onnever pausing, never looking into his eyes, his soul-gate, reading the signs that spell

I  A-M  H-U-R-T-I-N-G.

Insensitivity is painful. It's damaging to our relationships, and it grieves our God.

To be thick is understandable. To be thick and tired of it is commendable. To be thick and tired of it but unwilling to changeis inexcusable.

5234753,5,B00915G6SU,"This whole series is a great watch. I would recommend this to any adult, but suggest the kids head to bed during these episodes.",1403827200,,128,4.375
5234754,5,B00915G6SU,"Bought this for my husband's father's day gift.  He specifically asked for the seasons that were left to complete his set.  He loves the show, although I feel it is a bit too ""dark"" and difficult to watch such intense drama.",1403740800,,224,4.439024390243903
5234755,5,B00915G6SU,"Love this season. So many twist and turns. I love how this season they left little hints for other episodes. It makes you want more, like a good book you can't put down.",1403740800,,169,4.151515151515151
5234756,5,B00915G6SU,"I love the way they talk you through the crime,, what makes everything pull together and the way to the end and then everything can change.

Love this show, I wish I had all nine seasons and every episode.

Thanks,

Debbie",1403654400,,222,4.365853658536586
5234757,5,B00915G6SU,This is also one of the brilliant crime programmes that I watched on TV and having the set makes it that much better.,1403568000,,117,4.130434782608695
5234758,5,B00915G6SU,"I held off from watching this season for a while due to the departure of the Emily Prentiss character played by Paget Brewster. Now after watching the whole season on DVD, I have no idea why I did that. The series continues to provide the creepiest of the creeps, and story lines with lines of truth to them. As a bonus, since the show has been on for 8 seasons now, the writers have been starting to integrate more of the character's personal lives into the story, something that had greatly added to the structure and mythology of the series. I miss Paget Brewster, but the new character fills the void with additional story lines.",1403568000,,633,4.51304347826087
5234759,5,B00915G6SU,"Love this show.  I think I'll buy the other 7 seasons also.  A tad expensive, but definitely the easiest method to purchase, and super easy to use once you've bought it.",1403481600,,169,4.419354838709677
5234790,4,B00915G6SU,I love this show. saw part one of an episode and had to buy part two. Im glad we can do this on amazon. it was my first time using this service :),1403395200,,146,3.4545454545454546
5234791,5,B00915G6SU,Didn't get a chance to watch much of season 8 but know that it was one of the scariest seasons that has been on.  I look forward to being able to sit down and watch them all.,1403395200,,174,3.7027027027027026
5234792,5,B00915G6SU,My wife and I both love this series and season 8 only has 7 better and that is first seven seasons!,1403136000,,99,3.761904761904762
5234793,4,B00915G6SU,"I LOVE Criminal Minds and have no shame admitting to being a fanatic. In my opinion, the show has the best ensemble cast I can ever remember seeing. I experience the show as being fairly accurate (in reference to crime/procedural and behavioral facts, psychological disorders, etc). Many episodes since the show's inception have been (loosely) based on real cases, so originality has remained fairly intact through the years, which is refreshing. I love the very the very timely use of music - both instrumental compositions as well as recognizable rock n roll tunes - I wish, like so many other fans that the powers that be would release an official soundtrack. A box set could be made...there are so many awesome songs.

  The only reason why I rate season 8 as less than perfect is due to the absence of actress Paget Brewster and her character on the show, Emily Prentiss. Prentiss was arguably the strongest female lead; characters like Prentiss just cannot be easily replaced. Although the writers didn't attempt to do this exactly, a new female cast member was added. Played by Jean Tripplehorn, the new female agent just doesn't ever seem to fit in.

  As much as I'm disturbed by the absence of Paget Brewster, I'll be a big girl & admit that I'm pretty biased. Emily Prentiss was my favorite character, and I honestly don't think that I would have liked nor endorsed ANYONE who tried to follow in the footsteps of the best fictional FBI BAU heroine in television history.",1402963200,3,1481,4.788235294117647
5234794,5,B00915G6SU,"This is my daughter's favorite show and we also agree.  Each episode is riviting and sometimes the endings are good and sometimes not.  This is what life is about ... you win some, you lose some.  Watching this show makes you realize that there are some really evil and twisted people in the world and that innocent people can (and do) get hurt.",1402876800,,345,4.444444444444445
5234795,5,B00915G6SU,I could get completely lost in any season and do a marathon. I have learned so much about the reasons why things are done and we can't help but learn to love the character's who are a part of this madness. The amazing sacrifices they make in order to keep us safe. I am addicted and I don't want a 12 step program. I am happy,1402531200,,325,3.9393939393939394
5234796,5,B00915G6SU,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows, and once again they did not disappoint!  It was exciting and action packed.  Season 8 has twists that I did not expect, but enjoyed thoroughly.",1402185600,,187,4.636363636363637
5234797,5,B00915G6SU,If you like Criminal minds than you will love this DVD box set.  I actually suggest getting every season on DVD.  I watch it over and over.,1401926400,,139,4.111111111111111

5234799,5,B00915G6SU,This season was excellent and a wonderful wrap-up to a few loose ends of the show that had been waiting. I enjoyed the character development of the team itself and the fact that the writing is still original and entertaining.,1401062400,,225,4.65
5234910,5,B00915G6SU,I have every season of this show on DVD. We love to sit and watch the episodes and have a TV marathon. Especially with no commercials.,1401062400,,134,4.1923076923076925

5234918,3,B00915G6SU,"I love this show and have been a fan from the beginning. There are only two things I hate about this season, one the actors playing director, those episodes turn out to be horrible and the actors have less screen time but my biggest complaint is the character of Agent Blake. She is ruining the show for me and I have been a die hard fan from the first episode. I almost cant bare to watch it anymore. They should have just left that role empty after Prentiss left the show. I also wish they would go more into the Agent's personal lives like they used to.",1399075200,,556,4.205607476635514

I is 35 years old.  Although I know this is a TV show, I would love to help people the way that these people do.  I love the study of behavior and have never seen a show that I have found boring.  I will say that I am not a great fan of the new person.  It does seem that they have to replace a person with a new person with the same hair color, I found her to be a bland, but it's hard to not compare her to Emily.  She seems a little to old and boring for the show.",1392595200,,634,3.610294117647059

Jeanne Tripplehorn does not seem to fit in.  Doesn't give the feeling the show once had, that the whole group was like a well oiled machine and worked  well  together to solve cases.  Season 8 was good but was still disappointing to me.

Seems the scripts are also lacking not the quality they used to be.  I have a feeling  if they don't pick the pace back up  and start providing some outstanding scripts they will be off the air in another year or 2 at the most.

5235365,5,B00915G6SU,"To be honest, Season 6, Season 7, and Season 8 of Criminal Minds were admittedly not the best.  Now, by no means am I going to fanboy about the absence of Paget Brewster (Prentiss), but I will say that whereas her leaving was not the best choice in the world, and she will be missed, the series has redeemed itself greatly with the beginning of Season 9.  I picked Season 8 to review because I feel like this is the season people will flock to, and I specifically picked Zugzwang because it is my favorite Season 8 episode.  But let's start from the beginning.

Criminal Minds gathers a large following, and is one of CBS' better shows, however, for every 2 fans, there are about 3 haters.  It's truly underrated, but I am glad that CBS knows it's potential.  I guess I'll look at each season so you have some sort of reference.  Please note that this is my opinion, so it is subjective.  But regardless of what I say, I still urge whoever reads to watch from Season 1, because this is still a great show.

The first season truly was horrible.  Lucky for me, I started watching the show at the beginning of season 5, or I probably would have never watched it again.  The first season had some great episodes, but there were two problems:  Mandy Patinkin and Lola Glaudini.  Mandy Patinkin serves as a problem because Mandy Patinkin doesn't stick to anything he does.  Lola Glaudini serves as a problem because her character added nothing to the show, and is probably my least favorite character of this entire series.  The season is filled with great episodes, however I felt the character centered plots and subplots were a little disorganized.

The biggest downfall in Season 2 is frankly that Elle didn't die from her gunshot wound and it took 6 episodes for her to leave.  However, it did redeem itself by adding in Prentiss 3 episodes later.  The strength of this season rests on the 2 part episode that has Reid kidnapped by an UnSub, tortured, drugged, and rescued.  However, it wasn't the episodes themselves that made this great, it was the effect on Reid with his drug addiction.  They didn't milk the storyline, but rather let it linger slightly in the air before resolving it.  Which is nice, and made for some really great moments.

Season 3 is good for 2 reasons.  Gideon leaves and Mandy Patinkin leaves.  I actually liked the Gideon character, and Mandy Patinkin did a wonderful job portraying him, but as I mentioned earlier, he doesn't stick to anything.  The Season 2 plot involving Gideon's girlfriend was weak in my opinion, but at least it got Gideon off the show.  Again, I don't dislike the character, but I feel Rossi, who debuts in this season, was better and more interesting.  The worst episode in this was the 2 parter involving Garcia being shot.  I feel like it was unnecessary, as they already did this with Elle.  The season is a little rocky, but it hits its stride as it moves on.

Season 4 begins with the aftermath of the explosion and begins the ear problem with Hotch.  To me, this was a great subplot that worked well into the season, however, I do feel it is essentially a counterpart to Reid's drug addiction. The strength of this season is it's focus on Reid's childhood in the 2 part episode (I'm sensing a pattern with the 2 parters) Memoriam, and the 2 part finale, To Hell and Back, which begins the subplot of The Reaper.

Season 5 was where I started.  And I loved it from beginning to end.  The best part of the season was the Murder of Hotch's wife, which, like most tragedies to a main character, set the show up for a massive subplot relating to Hotch.

Season 6 was probably the worst of them all.  For the most part, it started off pretty good, and JJ's departure didn't phase me too much, as I realized it had the potential to bring some good moments in.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  Then Prentiss ""dies.""  This is why I don't much care for this season.  JJ leaves after episode 2, then at the very last episode of the season, comes back.  Prentiss is killed, and then, psych!  Faked it.  As many good episodes that this season had, there are way too many bad moments that just drag it down.  Also, the Seaver character just felt too much like an Elle clone to me.

Season 7 was also not the best, I must say, even though it was a step up from the terror that was Season 6.  The subplot involving Reid's relationship with JJ and Prentiss was good, but not noteworthy.  Honestly, I was even more surprised that this show wasn't canceled after this season than I was when I learned it wasn't after Season 6.

Season 8 begins after Prentiss has left the BAU.  Everyone got really upset about this, but honestly, I like the Blake character.  She makes a great addition, and combines qualities of Prentiss and Gideon, while still being solid.  This season, while not great, had a great subplot (eventually a main plot) that started right at the beginning of the season with the Replicator.  The best episode of the season was Zugzwang.  Reid has always been the most lovable character on the show and everyone wants him to be happy, and throughout the season, we are teased with him possibly having a girlfriend.  When we finally meet her, however, and are able to connect with her and love the two as a couple, she's taken away in the last scene, which was possibly one of the saddest scenes I've ever watched on a TV show.  It reminded me of why I loved the show in the first place, even with all of its flaws.  The fact that it could bring emotion by messing with your mind instead of your eyes.

This show is not perfect, and there are many legitimate reasons to shy away, but it is an underrated gem that, if you dig a little, shines under all the dirt.  I rate it as one of my top shows and I really suggest watching it all the way from the beginning.  Plus, as soon as the 9th season is complete, if you already haven't been watching it, watch it, too, because it has been the best season of the show so far, even with only 6 episodes (as of this writing).",1383264000,3,6013,4.443327239488117
5235366,5,B00915G6SU,Criminal Minds has always been an excellent show. The FBI profilers travel around the world to catch serial killers by studying their human behavior. Joe Mantegna is my favorite actor on this program. All of the other actors do a great job too on this show.

I found that the Alex Blake character worked well in conjunction with the established characters.  The plots were well-written and interesting -- though some plots were a bit unusual.  I don't watch TV, so I had not seen a single episode of the 8th season.  My style is to order a new season, and have a marathon when the package arrives in the mail -- watching about one complete disc at a sitting.  I read the summaries in advance, and, sometimes, skip to an episode that has a continuing theme. I am glad that I purchased Criminal Minds, The Eighth Season.

They had some good behind the scenes stuff on profiling - Peter Pan Syndrome is the only one I can remember at the moment, but there were more.  Also, they did a round table with all the writers, with A.J. Cook and Kristen Vangsness (J.J. & Garcia) asking the questions.  Hilarious and informative.",1381104000,,511,4.644444444444445

5235781,5,B00915G6SU,"I love this show.  Even got my daughter hooked on it.  I buy the newest season every Christmas for her.  I agree that this year the show hasn't got it's usual zing.  You really need Emily Prentiss back.  Also need to remove Tripplehorn.  She is too much like a robot  -- no emotion.  I don't know why the writers made her such a dud. The other thing I didn't like was how they killed off Reid's girlfriend.  Why isn't he allowed to have a romantic life?  I will still watch the show, but hope to see some improvements next year.",1379030400,,528,4.19
5235782,2,B00915G6SU,"I don't watch this show anymore. Basically in order to understand why I only gave it two stars it is important to stress the following:

I have a deep respect for the USA System of Justice. No matter how serious is the accusation, a suspect always has the right to a fair trial.

And that is the reason why I used the word ""disturbing"": in Criminal Minds, the FBI agents are at the same time, Cops, Judge, Jurors and Executioner. These agents always killed the suspect. The concept of Fair Trial, which is so important in the USA System of Justice is basically absent. After several episodes I started to fear both the FBI Agents and the Suspects.

This being said, Criminal Minds, as a show, is well done: actors are good, the plot development is clever, etc. But my problem remains: because I respect so much USA System of Justice is painful to watch police agents being judges, jurors and executioners all at the same time. That is all.

Obviously, for Criminal Minds fans this is not relevant because the show is good the way it is. My point of view is strictly personal and highly influenced by my personal respect for USA System of Justice. That is all.",1379030400,,1159,4.504761904761905

5235785,5,B00915G6SU,I love mystery stories and this is different because it is based on the real FBI/BAU and the characters have their own perspective. When will Will and JJ have another child.

5235819,4,B00915G6SU,"HATED to give Criminal Minds anything but a 5 star review.  I have loved this show from the very first episode.  The casting on this show has always been top notch, especially since it's been a bit of a revolving door.  I don't know if Paget Brewster (Emily Prentiss) decided to leave the show or if they made a serious blunder by getting rid of her...much as they did when they didn't renew J.J.'s contract, but the show REALLY took a turn for the worse this year.  They could have saved it with some great casting, but I seriously DO NOT like the Jeanne Tripplehorn character!!  Maybe a decent actress could have done a better job, but I doubt it.  She does not fit in with the group, could not be more boring to watch and whenever she's on I tend to zone out and have actually walked away from TV when she's on.  This is something I have never done in the previous 7 seasons, I am usually on the edge of my seat through each episode.  I love this show so much and hate that they are starting their downhill slide, but I dislike the character so much that I doubt I will sit through or even DVR another season with her on it.  I intend to buy season 8 in hopes that they realize how bad it is with her on it and fix it like they did when J.J. was not on.  All that negativity aside...you are missing one of the best, most exciting shows ever on tv if you don't catch the first 7 seasons.  Before this year I actually planned my week around making sure I didn't miss an episode.  There's never been another show quite like it before.",1378166400,51,1534,4.16271186440678

I am still not warming up to this newest character (I don't even know her name) and was not happy to see her in Reid's business during Season 8.  But I faithfully watched Season 8 - every episode.  I really, really, really wish Paget Brewster would return but I guess that won't happen.  At least the rest of the cast is intact and I can ignore her.

5235878,1,B00915G6SU,"In calling this the worst show on TV, I'm trying to make a calculation that combines the quality of the show vs. the length of time it has been on the air (and perhaps the length of time it seems likely to continue).  I started watching during the first season, and while it wasn't a great show, it wasn't completely awful.  In particular, the presence of Mandy Patinkin came the show something of a moral center.  However, Mr. Patinkin had the sense to leave the show during the second season, and the program went into a long period of decline.

  The worst period was probably during the fourth and fifth seasons, when the show was dominated by very disturbing storylines, often directed at the members of the team itself.  At the very least, this should have brought the team to an end -- all of them were victims of PTS issues, and should have been transferred to other FBI departments.  But, since the show has to go on, Criminal Minds is left with its cast of damaged human beings.  When you combine this with the number of years the show has been in production, things have gotten pretty grim.  The writers are clearly having difficulty coming up with stories that resemble actual law enforcement.  The actors look very tired with what they are doing.  However many times can they utter the psychobabble about the ""unsub"" and expect it to mean anything?  One striking feature about the show is the way the team operates with little involvement from local law enforcement, whose knowledge of their own community usually mean they're the ones most likely to solve local crime.

  I know crime procedurals on TV are rarely realistic, but Criminal Minds has moved onto a largely imaginary world of bizarre killers and their own set of magical words that allow them to ""solve"" crime.  In many ways, the fact that is show has gone on for eight years and remains popular is the most disturbing thing about it.",1377216000,8,1910,4.636904761904762

5235991,5,B00915G6SU,"Every show is just so fascinating to me because it is like one huge brand new trauma that makes you feel like you are really there ,..

Plus I love the cast of characters ... every one of then Jennifer Jureau and hubby and child, David Rossi .. definitely good choice  Thomas Gibson perfect boss .. shemar moore ... absolutely amazing actor and kind of like the hero ... and Penelope Garcia ... how can you not love her ... then there is the infamous Dr. Reid ... Matthew Gray Gubler ... in real life he must be a genius as well because he acts like it is totally really for him being a genius ...

And there always is new and more graphic content and it is always REFRESHING and new twists and turns

And I also like how it shows what is going on in their personal lives as well ...

Hotchner's wife getting shot by George Foyette ... aka THE REAPER

And then Matthew Gray Gubler ... getting abducted ... deallng with the dead kid and then his addiction and then falling in love and crying his eyes out in front of everyone

then JJ and her Hubby .. when his partner got shot and he goes inside the building and JJ is screaming ""Will will"" and then pleads with hotchner to go In and get him ... then she asks him to propose to her in the hospital room and that beautiful wedding

I do miss Emily Prentiss quite a bit ... though Jeanne Triplehorn or Trippleton ?? is doing a good job

And of course we cannot forget the Used to be a complete BITCH boss who recently just died ...

And Morgan talking to the public about being molested and

They show their own personal hardships and tragedies as we all do in life .. and that is one of the reasons I love it so much

And every week it is something ""on the edge of your seat"" different

And then there is Hotchner having fallen in love again ... which is soo cool if you have been watching Criminal Minds from the very beginning and his son

And one of my favorite scenes was Rossi helping Hotchner coach is son's soccer team and the ball goes back to Jack and Hotcher is saying ""kick it Jack"" and Hotchner and Ross are excitedly walking down toward the goal line and jack kicks it inn for a goal .. and how they high five and do that holding of the hands while all of the kids pass through

I love how David Rossi has become this kind of ""mentor"" to everyone ... and like helping out Prentiss with those exercisms and how he showed up with Morgan on recent show ... while he was remodeling

I love David Rossi .. I love all of them ...

Even Shemar Moore coming out of Penelope's shower ... ooh la la

So it is my most absolute FAVORITE show ..

And I am sure it does depict what really happens in our real world ... there are a lot of psychos out there

I also have been through personal tragedy and I can relate to the characters ... I have been raped in real life and I feel kind of healed every time they solve a case .. and how they go out to eat etc.

So 10+ is my score for Criminal Minds!!!

God Bless and remember that our guardian angels are always with us ... thank you criminal minds",1372723200,,3045,4.090909090909091

5236173,3,B00915G6SU,"Since 2006, Criminal Minds, has been the only 'Network' television show that I watch (including news & sports). - Seriously~!
But I would be remiss if I didn't admit that for much of season 7 and most of season 8, CM's writers are clearly sabotaging the integrity of the once believable characters and their subsequent development.  Each one brings a unique quality to the team, and over the years that quality has been held in a delicate balance with a combination of personal & professional strengths, skills, performance, and a certain vulnerability that every human being has had to struggle with since the beginning of time ... that is, until the rise of the super-unnaturally perfect characters of JJ Jareau and Derek Morgan .  Since they were introduced, neither of these characters have shown even the slightest sign of a character defect or a professional/personal vulnerability - nor have either suffered so much as a nano-momentary lapse of judgement, or a kink in their vast intellect as they coolie overcome a wide range of nasty and highly dangerous serial killers without so much as breaking a sweat -- Simply put, Mogan and JJ have evolved into the omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent superhuman FBI agents without faults, without limitations, and without the defects that define us as human beings.  Perfection belongs to diamonds, not to FBI agents.
I do hope that the producers reel in this trend before it ruins the only decent show left on Network Television.

On the upside - Matthew Gray Gubler has carefully molded his role as agent Spencer Reid into a character that can, and possibly will demand its own show.  Add to that, his skills behind the camera are clearly evolving and maturing with the episodes he directs offering us an even creepier voyage into the darkest abyss of the 'Criminal Mind' - His POV is part Steven King, part H.P. Lovecraft, and part Alfred Hitchcock.  Watch out for this guy, he is the Real Deal~!
Having said all that, the show is still the best Killer Thriller Drama that CBS, NBC, & ABC have to offer and I will no doubt keep making my plans around Wednesday night at 9:00 ~",1368921600,2,2133,4.798365122615804
5236174,5,B00915G6SU,Thank goodness the added character has worked well. It gives to more story lines. The beloved characters are also aging well.

5236175,4,B00915G6SU,"Just sayin, if you are a paranoid person you might not want to watch this show. Don't get me wrong, this is a great series, it's just that after watching several episodes you start to think that there are a zillion serial killers out there. on the other hand, there are way more than you would think and there is nothing wrong with being cautious/vigilant...........better than being a victim!  OK, maybe I am watching too much Criminal Minds:) It's still a great show",1368921600,,468,4.63855421686747

Another great benefit to Amazon Prime videos:  I have a DVR, but DVR's will only record at the scheduled time.  If there is a change in the schedule or a football game runs over, you get a partial recording: half the previous show, half the show you wanted to watch.  Drives me crazy.  With Season Pass, I can relax and just check in on my account to watch the program at my convenience.  And, NEWSFLASH, I can watch it on other devices as well.",1368748800,,628,4.43859649122807
5236187,2,B00915G6SU,"The lift that kept this show watchable and interesting is totally gone this season.  I have no idea what happened but not even the familiarity of a long-running show has me catching the episodes as soon as they air.  I've found that I have naturally stopped watching them nevermind eagerly awaiting a new episode.  I can go a week without noticing that I have missed an episode which makes ... Law and Order: SVU a more entertaining, tighter constructed show these days.

It's the whole show that is the problem.  It feels like someone has given up on making it good.  It's not just casting Jeanne Tripplehorn or that Reid remains a tedious crybaby well into his thirties.  It's that the stories no longer seem to have impact.

At least that one season of the spinoff was fascinatingly strange.",1368576000,6,794,4.661870503597123

5236360,5,B00915G6SU,"""Criminal Minds"" returned for its eighth season on CBS television in the 2012-2013 with a couple of cast changes and a terrific lineup of new cases, to be solved by the special agents of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit (BAU).  The storylines continue to be about unique criminal mindsets, delivered by an excellent ensemble cast with well-developed characters and dynamic teamwork.

At season's begining, Special Agent Emily Prentiss moves on to a choice position with Interpol, to be replaced by FBI linguists expert Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who brings a new set of skills to the team and some significant baggage with Assistant Director Erin Strauss, who supervises the BAU.  Alex will have an immediate impact within the team, not least in assisting Dr. Spencer Reid in a relationship with a girlfriend he has never met face to face.  The girlfriend is being stalked by an unknown person, and her story arc will be dealt with over several episodes, climaxing in a traumatic confrontation between Reid and the surprising stalker.

""Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season"" continues to feature crime-of-the-week drama, in which the team flies off from FBI HQs to assist local law enforcement in tracking down a serial killer with unique psycological characteristics.  The storys involve emotionally wrenching elements and significant suspense, as the BAU races the killer or killer to his or her last victim.  Storys include insights into the lives of the team, from Hotchner's new girlfriend to Penelope's old boyfriend and much else.  There are no indications the show is running out of originality.

A continuing narrative threat over the course of the season is the presence of an unknown subject who is stalking the team itself.  The unsub is first glimpsed by the audience photographing the team at work on cases.  He will eventually make his presence known baiting the team byh replicating crimes they have already solved, and by seeming to work with accomplices.  The team itself is vulnerable, in a way not seen since the Reaper went after Hotchner and his family in Season Five.  But you'll have to watch to find out what happens...

""Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1364601600,,2219,5.077134986225896

5236506,3,B00915G6SU,"I have been watching Criminal Minds since its first episode and have always loved it. The quality of the show has had its ups and down- the season in which Prentiss and JJ were dismissed was one of the worst. Many fans (including myself) didn't like the new agent, Seaver, who replaced the two veteran stars. But I think this season is truly worse even than Seaver's season (season 6, I think). Why? Because of the newest team member, Agent Blake. Her character is cold, dull, and has almost no sense of humor. I can't see her really bonding with the rest of the team, and in fact, she expressed a dislike for ""sensitive"" people. Does that mean she doesn't like Garcia or Morgan? They both get a bit sensitive and the cases sometimes get to them emotionally. Is she saying she'd rather work with robots?

I truly hope that the show either makes some changes to Blake's character or kindly asks Tripplehorn (the actress playing Blake) to leave.

And what's with the endings? Why are they always the same? What's going on with this season? Where's the creativity? And why is the unsub's identity revealed so early on? It's so much less fun that way!
I give this episode 3 stars.",1361491200,45,1176,4.5424528301886795

From El leaving to Reid being kidnapped...etc. I received all seven seasons for Christmas and I couldn't be happier.  The show pulls me in and I fell like despite all of the cruelty of and to humanity, there is good in the world. Yes I know it's a T.V. show, but like I said it has a way of pulling me in.

I am waiting to pre-order the 9th season already! After last nights premier I know it will be a MUST have, I still cannot express how much I enjoy this series as a whole!
