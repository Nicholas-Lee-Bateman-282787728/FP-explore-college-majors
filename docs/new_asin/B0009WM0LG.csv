8068635,4,B0009WM0LG,"Our 3 year old loves this video.  It is very ""low-tech,""  being composed of old video clips.  I was worried that she would be afraid of some of the darker characters (like Baba Yaga), but she thinks they are funny.  It is a great way to help your bilingual child build on her vocabulary and language concepts.  Although we do not otherwise let our children watch TV at all, this video is worth it, for educational purposes.",1173657600,,423,4.441558441558442
