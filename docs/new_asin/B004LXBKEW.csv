8435282,4,B004LXBKEW,This DVD wasn't as informative about the historical aspects of Machu Picchu as the History Channel DVD was. But it gave another perspective about a fascinating and special site.,1376265600,5,177,5.137931034482759
8435283,1,B004LXBKEW,"The title of this video is misleading. The title and the graphic highlights Machu Picchu, but Machu Picchu only comes into the scene at the 50th minute . Sadly it only lasts for 6 minutes. The rest of the video talks about Peru, the Incas, even Nazca lines. The producer should highlight ""the Legacy of the Incas instead"". If you are looking for Machu Picchu per se, avoid this title. Look else where.",1358640000,9,401,4.506849315068493
