518655,2,6302795567,This movie would be a good film if you didn't no it was a sequel to or had never seen Rocky Horror. It has its moments and a few catchy tunes but pales in comparison to its predecessor.,947203200,,185,3.8947368421052633
518656,2,6302795567,Esta pelicula no tiene nada que ver con la extraordinaria Rocky Horror Picture Show. Buenos actores y buena musica pero una trama estupida y aburrida. Si van a comprar esta pelicula solo porque es la continuacion de  una pelicula de culto les recomiendo que mejor ahorren su dinero.,946944000,,282,4.875

518658,4,6302795567,"This film is not as good as the original, but it still is a good movie for die hard fans.  But you have to know how to watch it.  The biggest confusion for me when I first watched it was the fact that the entire movie  takes place on a TV set.  But then I realized that Denton is a TV station.  Marriage Maze is a marriage cpunseler, Dentonvale is the local hospital,  Happy Homes it the place to live in the town, The morning shows are the  newspapers and reporters, and Faith Factory is the local church.  But like  any of these, when you associate them with TV, they all become so fake.  Good movie and excellent representation on reality.",941846400,2,642,4.231404958677686

518660,4,6302795567,"I ordered this movie looking for a rocky horror picture show sequel.  And the first time I watched it, I was disappointed.  When it arrived from Amazon.com I watched it, and there were no transvestites or anything.  So I  put it away and for a week I convinced myself it was the worst movie.  Then  I popped it in a week later, and I loved it!  It wasn't really a sequel,  but it was still a great movie.  And the songs, while not as funny as those  from the Rocky Horror Picture show, are really good.  So, don't be afraid  to buy it.  It is great, even if you don't like it at first.",930268800,3,585,4.026315789473684

The idea of the reality show was new, a few decades bfore the first real one, so that idea is rather clever, and showing how people would do anything to be on TV, was right on point.  but it really didn't need to be Brad and Janet, especially since they couldn't get the same actors to play them anyway.  Weird songs, odd dialogue and strange fashion should appeal to fans of RHPS.",1479600000,,634,4.302521008403361

The story is a bit muddled but as long as one is sober it's not difficult to understand. Despite a different cast this still preserves the legacy of cult classic RHPS. I personally believe the music is better than Rocky. I appreciate that Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn were in this, however I believe the presence of Little Nell in this film was a grave mistake, she's impossible to understand and annoying.

518747,1,6302795567,This movie made sense to me but the movie literally kills itself with a complete lack of a real conclusion. Brad and Flavors 'battle' is a casual glance and Flavors simply forgets he was the villian - only for him to shrug off his defeat and walk away winning. Then Brad and Janet walk away...  this movie feels incomplete and rushed. Almost as if there was supposed to be a third act but it was never actually written. What's worst then a bad movie? A movie with great ideas that it collosally wastes!,1456531200,,502,4.397849462365591

The film is a musical and a visual fast paced entertainment. It's not the sequel to Rocky Horror. Many of the cast members from Rocky appear as other characters. The original Brad and Janet were replaced by Cliff De Young and Jessica Harper.

If you want to watch something different, this film is definitely unusual and proud of it. It was definitely ahead of its time about reality programming include talk shows. DTV is supposed to be set in Denton USA but there was an actors strike so they filmed entirely in a London studio in England.

Apart from the film, it includes a film history and a music featurette. I enjoyed watching the cast and crew reflect on filming. If you enjoyed Rocky Horror, you will enjoy this film despite its many differences.

518922,5,6302795567,"As a Rocky Horror fan who has performed in a live ""shadowcast"" in a small town theatre, ""Shock Treatment"" at first was just that...a shock to the system.  While I enjoyed many of the songs, I would joke that I needed to watch Rocky as an antidote to ""Shock Treatment"" whenever I watched it.  But it didn't take long for this unique little musical to grow on me.

As has been mentioned, it's eerie how insightfully it foreshadows the ""reality TV"" that has now taken over the networks, but back then was virtually unheard of.  And the music is fantastic, clever and just plain fun.  Really, the best way to enjoy it is to not expect it to be a Rocky Horror clone, but to sit back and experience it as something that stands on its own merits, albeit with an affectionate nod to its predecessor.

I do have to respectfully disagree with Rocky/Shocky's genius creator Richard O'Brien, who famously described it as ""not a prequel, not a sequel, but an equal.""  While it certainly has a different storyline and vibe, one cannot avoid the fact that it absolutely does fit the descripiton of a sequel.  It was written by the same person, features some of the same characters (most notably Brad and Janet) as well as many of the original actors in new roles, and, arguably of most importance, it specifically takes place after the events of the first movie, some of which are referred to (such as Ralph and Betty's wedding, at which the now-married Brad and Janet became engaged) and is set in the same town of Denton.  Just because it doesn't take place inside a castle and Tim Curry isn't running around in a bustier (darn!) doesn't mean it doesn't qualify as a sequel.

""Shock Treatment"" is worth checking out for Rocky fans and non-fans alike.",1368835200,,1737,4.574193548387097

518925,3,6302795567,"Brad and Janet escape the clutches of the evil Dr. Frank-N-Furter only to end up becoming the unwitting stars of Denton TV's hit reality series in this little-known follow up to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Cliff De Young and Jessica Harper step in as Brad and Janet Majors, with many other familiar faces found within the cast (including screenwriter Richard O'Brien returning as the eccentric Dr. Cosmo McKinley). O'Brien transforms his love of cult Horror movies and classic television into another wild Rock Opera that strikes at America's obsession with the small screen. Although the musical numbers treat us to the same sharp wit and colorful characters as before, SHOCK TREATMENT never reaches the same level success as its predecessor. The tunes simply aren't as catchy, and none of the crazed villains can ever match Tim Curry's signature role as Transylvania's finest transvestite. Jessica Harper does a fine job in her solos ""Me of Me"" and ""Carte Blanche,"" but even she cannot top her previous performance in Brian De Palma's THE PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE. In spite of its shortcomings, SHOCK TREATMENT has still found its own cult following amongst the midnight crowds, and is sure to entertain fans of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.

518928,4,6302795567,"If you want to know what it is pure television you have to watch that sequel of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. It was done for television and constantly remindS you of the fact.

The whole action takes place in the Denton TV studio. It is the story of a television show that changes sponsors. The new sponsor has to diabolize the older sponsor and to push forward a new icon for the new sponsor that creates at first a link with the older one. Hence they diabolize the older sponsor as some kind of emotional misfit and use his wife as the new icon. They will even reveal in the end that the new sponsor is in fact the twin brother of the older one. And there we have a basic simple primitive if not even simplistic theme that goes back to the oldest layers of prehistory, the conflict between two brothers, what's more twin brothers. Better than Abel and Cain. And this wife of the older sponsor will bring sight to the blind anchor man of the show. Isn't that divine and angelic and beautiful?

Then it uses language as some kind of mesmerizing fascinating hypnotizing whip to make you get in line with the game. The rhyming patterns are so simple that they seem to be like the drums of some voodoo dance with a lot of Hollywood sauce on top and a simplistic comic flavour underneath. You are the pronged cattle taken up and tied up in that caravan, carnival, canned mental emptiness. And the main catch letter to your ears and eyes is F. F mind you like in the most famous four letter word in English, and yet it is five Fs in one motto. Farley Flavors' Fabulous Fast Foods that becomes in the mouth of some TV announcer: ""First and Foremost, Farley Flavors' Fabulous Fast Foods Feed and Fortify Families For a Fabulous Future."" From five to thirteen, from the devil to the witch, from the pentacle to the worst omen possible on earth. Be repetitive and you will always reach the bottom of hell and the dire straits or purgatory. But don't expect to find heaven in commercial repetitiveness.

But the point is that this show, this film, this TV film, this film about TV and this film at the local TV station does not in the least try to make you think. It is here only to whirl you around into a maelstrom out of which you cannot escape. And don't believe there are good ones and bad ones. There are only old ones and new ones and new ones are neither better nor worse than old ones. They have only one aim which is to make you be a robotic un-thinker, a mechanized non-thinker, a motorized anti-thinker.

That's the kind of rapport TV wants to establish with its audience: all-sensorial, hypnotic, non-mental acceptance of the show as good or the same all-sensorial, hypnotic, non-mental rejection of the show as bad. You like or don't like but you sure don't have to think about it. It is all at the level of your kinetic and kinesthetic, kinesiological primary response at the essentially physiological level of your being, what they justly call the ""id"" in the show, with Freud's picture somewhere lost in that mess.

The only link with the Rocky Horror Picture Show is in fact in the flimsy vision of Grant Wood's painting known as American Gothic. But that is a clich, nothing else, not even a wink.

And be sure this TV film will not take any side between the losers of old and the winners of today. They will eventually all go their own ways but with the same convertible and one girl will be replaced by another one in the ""First and Foremost, Farley Flavors' Fabulous Fast Foods Feed and Fortify families For a Fabulous Future"" advertising venture, and the new one will even be better since she is a gorgeous, sumptuous, splendiferous, glorious and definitely opulent blonde. Television does not require the audience to think but only to feel good and relaxed.

Some may say it is a pastiche of a TV show or even of a TV comic thriller. But it is such a good pastiche that we do believe it is the real stuff. It is a perfect imitation of a TV show and as such it is a perfect pastiche, but that does not give it any mental reflective distance. It is meant to carry your adhesion or your rejection but not to make you think in any way. You like or you dislike but to agree or disagree is not even a question.

ST is actually a great work in its own right, an interesting, somewhat arcane, pre-post-modern story about character actors on acid. I'm thinking R.

518975,4,6302795567,"I went with my friends to midnight screenings of this at The Waverly theater right after it opened in New York, back in 1981. At the time, the pervasive use of video and television in the movie, blown up on a theatre screen, made it look astonishingly different. It really seemed fresh. Since then, the style has been copied to death and the effect has been diminished - especially on television, where it looks like television.

At the Waverly there was already a handful of ""regulars"" attending the midnight showings (it only played at midnight). These kids were clearly planted by 20th Century-Fox to get the audience participation going, hoping for another ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" There were a few smart and well-timed responses which are now long forgotten. This movie tanked but not deservedly.

It has a very dry patter to it and the acting is good. It takes multiple screenings to catch all the stuff that's said and going on. It's duh-roll duh-roll, as they say. The cast includes Barry Humphries (Dame Edna) as Bert Schnick, and Ruby Wax (who was much later a script supervisor for ""Absolutely Fabulous"" and who appeared in the ""Menopause"" episode as Beth DeWoody.) Rounding out the cast is Nell Campbell, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn and Charles Gray, all from ""Rocky Horror."" Seeing Brad and Janet portrayed by Cliff DeYoung and Jessica Harper was a bit of a shock at first, but Jessica Harper is a zinger and her voice is terrific. She has never worked enough in my opinion.

The film starts off strong and bright but it hits a sleepy spot around the middle point, from which it never fully recovers. Nevertheless, the songs are ace! The best are ""In My Own Way,"" ""Denton, U.S.A.,"" ""Lullaby"" and the title song, ""Shock Treatment."" It's definitely worth a look on Netflix if you've never seen it. It's too bad it never really found an audience in the first place.",1257552000,,1883,4.769938650306749
518976,5,6302795567,"If you are a fan of Shock Treatment, this DVD is the one you want. It has a few documentaries full of information and a wonderful commentary track as well. The color and over all image is fantastic, especially for those of us used to the old VHS release. Also, the sound quality is excellent.

A reviewer here said that the commentary should have been ""left to professionals"". This is a mean thing to say, especially considering that Madman Mike IS a professional in the world of Rocky Horror and Shock Treatment. Mike did a FABULOUS job. So did Bill Brennon for that matter. They give you tons of behind the scenes trivia and insight on the meaning of the movie and its making. I've heard the commentary on many, many DVDs and I've heard horrible ones that were done by directors, actors and other production people. In fact, just listen to the commentary done by Kiara Knightly on one of the Pirates of the Caribbean DVDs and you will think Madman Mike and Bill Brennon are totally professional by comparison.

Shock Treatment is very obscure in the scheme of things but it does have some really die hard fans and a ""cult within a cult"" following with Rocky Horror fans. Shock Treatment was WAY ahead of its time on many levels, especially predicting the direction that reality TV would go. There's not much reality in reality TV, and this movie sort of knew that before it happened.

This movie isn't for everyone. But for fans, its a long awaited and fantastic presentation and I can't recommend this DVD enough.",1241049600,4,1516,4.607407407407408

The absence of original stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick leave voids too big for this film to fill. With that being said 'Shock Treatment' still has some enjoyable moments for fans of the original.

Brad (Cliff De Young) and Janet (Jessica Harper) are unhappily married and still living in Denton. Denton has been converted into a giant T.V. studio where residents live and sleep whenever they're not watching endless hours of reality shows with names like 'Marriage Maze', 'Happy Homes' and 'Dentonvale'. The network, called DTV, has just been bought by a fast food kingpin named Farley Flavors (also De Young). Hoping to jump start their dull marriage Janet volunteers her and Brad for 'Marriage Maze'. The show's host Bert Schnick (Barry Humphries) takes an instant liking to her and an instant disliking to Brad. Together with Farley, Bert comes up with a plan to get Brad out of the picture so they can have full access to Janet. They devise a scheme to have Brad committed to a mental hospital like the one featured in 'Dentonvale' run by brother and sister duo Cosmo (Richard O'Brien) and Nation (Patricia Quinn) McKinley. With Brad locked up and doped up Farley and Bert use their newfound access to exploit and manipulate Janet in every way possible turning her into Denton's biggest celebrity a combination singer/actress. Whenever Janet asks about Brad they just drug her too so that she'll stay in a stupor and never question what's happening to her or her husband.

The film works thanks to it's biting satire and amazing anticipation of the onslaught of reality television that wouldn't occur for another 20 years. The story rings totally true in it's depiction of people willing to be exploited if it means they might become famous in the process. If things become too heady for you there's an amazing soundtrack to keep you entertained. Even die hard 'Rocky Horror' fans concede that the songs are better in 'Shock Treatment'. This being an 80's film that soundtrack includes traditional pop arrangements and ballads but also new wave and punk as well. The 80's treatment doesn't stop with the music the costumes and production design are deliciously retro as well. This film has a color scheme highly reminiscent of another Harper masterpiece 'Suspiria'.

Hopefully more people will discover this film thanks to this special edition DVD and realize it's not as bad as they've heard. It's actually pretty fun. Either way it proves Richard O'Brien's evil genius as both songwriter/composer and actor.

I heard in an interview with Patricia Quinn that one day during filming, Barry Humphries asked her ""Pat?  Do you know what this is about?""  ""No,"" she replied.  That about sums this movie up, but it's good anyway.

I'm a proud owner of a copy of the video, and I whip it out at the slightest provocation.  What I especially like about the movie is the rhythm, the feel of it.  It belongs to no specific time, it's long-ago and it's now, and it's the future.  It's almost alagorical, it's an absurdist perspective on media.",1226188800,,690,4.544715447154472

Well, yes, there is a reason. This musical/movie is rubbish, almost complete waste of time. Lack of plot is more evident than in RHS, and all in all it's just meaningless -- not funny, not particularly witty, doesn't go anywhere. And its ""criticism"" of media (or parody of 60s/70s tv shows, whatever) is too direct, too unsubtle. All in all, it's unfortunately a quite typical sequel.

I guess it is possible that in its time this was relevant, and it has just aged badly. But there are many movies that were relevant in their day and yet are still enjoyable to watch. This one is not vintage wine but low-grade vinegar.
I still give it two stars (as opposed to one) since it is some fun to spot all early-80s artifacts, from Space Invaders arcade machines to hair styles. And character casting/acting is not bad, even though plot is below sub-standard, and music is just-ok as well.",1203206400,,1156,4.634146341463414

This has NOTHING TO DO WITH ROCKY HORROR and that's it's strength.
These songs are more grown up and deal with more adult emotion and experience than RHPS. If you enjoy Richard O'Brien's lyrics and his campy humour then you will like this movie.

It bombed in the theatre and had a short lived life on the rental shelves but it's better than that. It's cooky and funny and a bit slow in plac es but the musicaly numbers make up for it.

519013,1,6302795567,"This is an atrocious film.  I just watched this right after watching Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it's surprising that the same writer and director veered so far off course from the glory of the former with this mess of a musical.

Yes, Janet and Brad from RHPS are back, but now it's years later and Janet's disgruntled with their marriage.  They sit in the studio audience of Denton TV, or DTV, the TV station of their hometown.  They are picked out of the audience to participate in a game show called ""Marriage Maze.""  And then, step by step, piece by piece, this story unravels into a mush that's hard to follow, and even harder to care about.

Shock Treatment trades the fun of RHPS, the charm of Frank-n-furter, the teasing of taboos, the clever interjections of the narrator, for an angry wife, vapid husband, creepy TV producer, and a panoply of attempts at cutting social commentary that consistently miss the mark.  Rocky Horror delighted in preying on our cultural norms about sexuality and howled with laughter as it danced all over them.  Shock Treatment doesn't seem to delight in much at all.  Some of the basic things you ask for as a viewer from a movie -- plot, character development, stakes -- have either atrophied here or are altogether gone.  You have to wonder if they spent more of the budget on cocaine than actually thinking this thing through.  It's that bad.

This hurt my brain.  This made my soul ache.  It's not even bad in a fun way.  It's more like ""Battlefield Earth"" bad.  Well okay, it's not THAT bad, but let's put it this way: if you don't like yourself, watch this -- it's like salt for your an open sore in your mind.",1190937600,5,1660,4.538720538720539
519014,3,6302795567,"I always wondered about this, having seen RHPS about 19 times by my last estimate (high school and college).  Back in the day, the buzz was immediately killed when word got out that Brad and Janet were being played by different actors, and that there would be no Tim Curry.  For me, the lack of a haunted castle was also a disappointment.  I don't think it was in theaters very long, at least not in my areas (Miami/Atlanta).

Anyway, some of the key elements are still in place here.  We have the basic idea of putting a naive couple through lots of misery--and to another nifty glam-rock soundtrack (with a touch of new wave).  We also have Mr. O'Brien and Ms. Quinn as another incestuous bro-sis team and Nell Campbell as a squeaky sexpot.

Cast and production team commentary go on and on about whether this is a sequel, a prequel, or (they unanimously agree) an ""equal.""  By my reasoning, it's a sequel, but only in the sense that it has to happen after the events of RHPS.  Brad and Janet are married, and Ralph and Betty Hapschatt are now separated.  No, there is not one reference to what happened in the previous film.  It seems that Brad's apparent romantic difficulties in this movie could have been tied in to the past trauma.  But you wouldn't know that from the script.

The set design and costumes are brilliant.  Charles Gray has a bigger part here.  He gets to walk around and have a part in the actual plot (but still shows no evidence of a ""*&%$ing neck"").  Barry Humphries, now Dame Edna, has a big part as loony game show host Bert Schnick.  Big, or minor, trivia note:  the guy who plays Ralph (Jeremy Newson) is the only person to play the same role in both films.

So.  Different.  But not better.  But not completely different, and quite good.  Rocky fanatics should not avoid this for fear of disappointment.  It's a nice dessert after the main course.  Another slice, anyone?",1190505600,,1902,4.523529411764706

2. Sal Piro, President of the RHPS fan club, said ""When it comes to the music of Shock treatment, I find myself listening to the music of Shock Treatment more than the music of Rocky.""

3. Jessica Harper is a much better singer than Susan Sarandon.

4. Nell Campbell is much hotter in 1981 than she was in 1975. Her voice is still annoying.

5. Shock Treatment is much better cast than RHPS. Patricia Quinn, Charles Gray ,Richard O'Brien, Barry Humphries, Ruby Wax, Cliff De Young and Jessica Harper are all stellar.

9. Oscar Drill and the Bits are much easier to look at than Meatloaf.

10. All the same elements of RHPS are present, but different and more skillfully executed. Its the next RHPS audience participation movie...just waiting for people to start making up questions and answers.

I do have some cold, hard truths, as I see them, I should mention. The movie is much hated, same as RHPS was in the beginning. If you love RHPS when you are sitting, by yourself, watching it, you will probably love Shock Treatment even more. If you only like RHPS on fan participation night and believe ""RHPS shouldn't be watched on DVD"", you'll probably hate Shock Treatment. Shock Treatment doesn't have the sexual tension present in it that Rocky did. It has a more mature, distinguished sexual character  to it.

Truth is, I hate musicals, but I love this movie. I like RHPS fine, but Shock Treatment is better and larger in every way other than fan participation.",1160352000,13,2108,4.559681697612732
519019,4,6302795567,"It is perhaps a truism that satire is a hard sell; that it doesn't work unless the audience knows exactly what is being satirized. If so, we can forgive 1981 audiences because they ""didn't get"" Shock Treatment. There is a saying in the theater: ""Satire is what closes on Saturday night."" Perhaps that can explain the short theatrical life and almost instant dismissal of this smart and clever film upon its initial release. It is a thoroughly satirical, media-mocking work of genius brought to you by the creators of the Rocky Horror Show. However, its original audience were not looking for smart and sassy satire; they were looking for more leather and whips and people running around in their underwear. You'll find none of that here. What you will find is a film about 20 years ahead of its time. It thoroughly savages the concept of media saturation and instant celebrity, aspects of society hardly even mentioned, much less understood back in 1981. Of course, we understand those things NOW due to own sickness of our constant bombardment of Crap Culture artifacts such as ""Access Hollywood,"" ""American Idol,"" and 24/7 news coverage. In this story, the town of Denton seems to utterly live for television. The townspeople sit in the studio audience of the local tv station all day, watching as the shows are taped and even seem to sleep there at night! Brad and Janet's marriage is troubled, so they go to see a marriage counselor. But by the film's logic, said marriage counselor is the host of a game show called ""Marriage Maze,"" their session being televised for all to see. Brad is then committed to an asylum which again is really a soap opera called ""Dentonvale."" And so on. All their lives are played out before a live audience, relative to whichever show they happen to be on at the time. It's not unlike Jim Carrey's ""The Truman Show"" in that regard, except the Dentonites know full well they are on tv, revel in that, and constantly aspire to earn themselves roles on ""better"" shows, backstabbing their friends and relatives in the process. How, I ask you, is that much different from the constant plotting and backstabbing of reality show contestants as they practically sell their souls to stay on the show a little longer? In Brad & Janet's media-as-god society, all of one's private business is a subject of public knowledge and consumption. When Janet's father hears an anecdote about a local boy caught naked with gay Mexicans, he immediately condemns the incident in song, offering his instant judgment by singing ""faggots are maggots; thank God I'm a man,"" much to the delight of the studio audience. This again, foreshadows our current means of public opinion--that of news story followed by immediate reaction via the internet and news commentary shows. I do not know if the movie's creators were amazingly prescient or just far more wary of the media at the time this movie was made...either way it seems like a commentary on TODAY's society, not that of 1981.

Aside from the obvious heavy and somewhat disturbing societal comment, this movie is fast-paced and very fun. The songs are mostly satirical but very enjoyable. ""Bitchen in the Kitchen"" is a hilarious send-up of common marital missteps, rhyming everyday household appliances with the problems of wedded bliss. Jessica Harper's deep and seductive tones serve her well in several tunes, while the original Rocky Horror cast lends a hand in the larger chorus numbers. The songs aren't as especially memorable or singable as the Rocky Horror songs, but they do achieve a far higher level of wit and intellect. Not to say that this is an ""intellectual musical,"" as it does still have its moments of outright rude hilarity. Ironically, a quick viewing of this movie requires far less brainpower than it did in 1981, because our society has almost become the thing that Shock Treatment satirizes. Anybody viewing it for the first time today will immediately understand its point. Some may even think it is a NEW movie, commenting on ""American Idol"" and ""Survivor.""

As for the dvd itself...it's far better than the old vhs release. It is at last in widescreen. The colors, contrast and picture are quite vibrant. The sound seems to have an odd remix in places. In the ""Denton"" number, it fades out too much during the clapping section, for example. Some of the dialogue scenes are a bit shrill as well. Overall the soundtrack is about 75% of what it should be. But the picture is, I would say, exceptional for its age. There are a few muddled extras...there are two ""making of"" type documentaries, which manage to record all-too-brief interviews with stars Cliff DeYoung, Betsy Brantley and Rocky alumni Patricia Quinn. There is also a dull audio commentary by Shock Treatment Fan Club Presidents Mad Man Mike and Bill Brennan...let's leave audio commentaries to the professionals from now on, shall we?

The film has long been neglected. It is written off by Rocky Horror fans because it's not a true sequel, and it was ahead of its time and misunderstood by the rest of the public. Its time is NOW. It deserves to be seen and studied, and very much enjoyed. It can be enjoyed on its own merits with or without Rocky Horror.

This film works on many levels.  First, it's an incredible satire on our country's obsession with media and celebrity.  Second, visually it was lightyears ahead of it's time.  Totally foreshadowed MTV style and Reality TV.  Third, it's a concept that was totally original and daring. (Let's not encourage someone for trying something different!) And fourth, it showcases the talent of some of the most quirky and campy performers of that time.  Jessica Harper is absolutely mesmerizing in her presence and her vocals are addictive!

I can't begin to explain the effect the film has on me.  It makes me laugh, makes me think, gives me chills and entertains me like nothing else.  You know, it took years for ""Citizen Kane"" to be recognized as the masterpiece that it is considered today.  And in it's own way, this small and obscure piece of art is a work that was conceived by filmmakers that were as much mavericks of their day as Orson Welles in his day.  Like ""Citizen Kane"", it just takes a few years to ""get"" it - ""Anyhow, anyway""!",1158278400,6,1546,4.777358490566038
519051,5,6302795567,"""Shock Treatment"" is a devastatingly underrated film and its place in celluloid history has Rocky Horror's unknown sequel is a misnomer. It is not a sequel. It is another kind of animal entirely. Where RHPS is dark and vampy, ST is bright and sterile. Where RHPS is guttoral, ST works on a more cerebral level.

It is some time later and Brad and Janet (now played by Cliff De Young and the amazingly talented Jessica Harper) are unhappily married and living in Denton. The town is, it seems, completely encased in a television studio where audience members (including Brad and Janet) clambor to get good seats and are then inundated by show after show. The unhappy couple is surprised to learn they have been chosen to be contestants on the game show ""Marriage Maze"". The host of the show (Barry Humphreys, better known as Dame Edna) convinces Janet to commit Brad to Dentonvale, a mental institution/hit show starring brother and sister Cosmo and Nation McKinley (Richard O' Brien and Patricia Quinn). This is all, of course, a plan by the studio's new owner (also played by De Young) who lusts after Janet and is planning to make her a big Denton star to serve his own nefarious ending. As you can tell, it soon begins to become difficult to tell what is television and what is scripted.

The new wave soundtrack is brilliant and not as derivitive as that of RHPS. The sterile and artificial looking sets and art direction are brilliant, and O' Brien rightfully earns his place as a brilliant futurist. This was a good two decades before reality television and here he's already commenting on it and our obsession with celebrity.",1158105600,3,1632,4.742957746478873
519052,5,6302795567,"Simply the best movie ever.

and more specifically, the best indie cult musical of all time.

I saw it in the theater in 1981 (yes it played in just ONE theater in the US) and was mesmerized.  Mind you I was a rocky Horror fan at the time, but was never too pleased with the dismal effect of the movie version of rocky (go see the play) and Shock breathed new life into the cast and crew, a modern new wave musical on the dawn of the 80s, all shiny and happy and poking fun at middle america for the morons that they are.

If yer a rocky fan, just get over it.  There are about a hundred references to the original movie strewn throughout Shock treatment, which is entertaining in its own right just to find and point out (think of it as a party game) and there are tons of other neat pop culture references in the amazingly deft screenplay and superb art direction.

If you are a big rocky afficianado and you don't appreciate the genius of this movie, you need to move on with your life.  (Actually, you should really do that anyway, I spent 5 years in the rocky horror subculture in its formative years, and really, it was fun as a teen in 1982, but try finding a new hobby or talking to real life humans sometimes for a change)

But please, DONT like this movie, because you probably have superb film taste and high standards of cinema excellence and drive an SUV and live in the suburbs, and we wouldnt want you in ""our"" club anyway.  But if you love sly indie comedy or you think russ meyer, john waters, pedro almodovar and herschell gordon lewis make great movies AND you love new wave music and think 1980 was a million times more culturally advanced than 1979, you will have great fun with this.

Then go rent the aussie musical Starstruck which features the same art director and equally good music.

And for you rocky horror trivia freaks, it should be pointed out that Cliff De Young was the original pick for Brad in Rocky Horror (the movie), but turned it down due to a scheduling conflict with his then hit tv show.  You can see what Cliff and Susan Sarandon wouldve been like together by watching the great 'alternate version of rocky horror' namely ""The Hunger"" where Susan and Cliff reprise Brad and Janet and Catherine Deneuve performs a splendid Frank N Furter to David Bowie's Riff Raff

Also, in Shock Treatment, note Christopher Malcolm, the DTV security guard, is the man who created the role of Brad on stage in London in 1973 (and played an x wing pilot in Star Wars as well)",1157673600,,2502,4.377969762419006
519053,4,6302795567,"I've felt affection for this movie since I first saw it on video in 1984. It's funny, and contains a clever, catchy score. Cosmo and Nation McKinley are a worthy follow up brother and sister team for Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn. Little Nell (who goes by the name Nell Campbell with this flick) is hilarious as Nurse Ansalong. Jessica Harper, new to the Rocky Horror phenomenon but already the Queen of the Out-of-the-Mainstream Movie by that point in her career, is wonderful as always. The new characters created for this movie are fun and generally likable, and the script has the sort of lines O'Brien is so good at writing. Brian Thomson's sets and Sue Blane's costumes are imaginative and create a great atmosphere, different from Rocky Horror--antiseptic where Rocky was grungy (in the old sense of that word), bright and shiny and somewhat elaborate where Rocky was more darkly lit, dilapidated and treadbare (wonderfully so)--but just as appealing and enjoyable. Recently, people have started to notice how prescient this movie was in predicting the age of reality television, so that might be an incentive for people who don't know it to check it out. But basically, most Rocky Horror fans already know whether they like this movie or not, and those that do will likely buy the DVD in all events.

The good news is: the picture quality is vastly superior on the DVD, and that odd sort of ""fast forward"" glitch that occurs for a few seconds during ""You're Looking at an Ace"" on the video release(s) has been fixed. For that reason alone I'd recommend this DVD. There are extra features, including two documentaries. It's great to see Jim Sharman, Richard Hartley, and Sue Blane. There are two almost identical commercials. They start and finish with an animated version of Cosmo, but otherwise are a sort of music video for the title song. I remember the television commercials that aired when the move was released back in 1981, and they included dialogue. I particularly remember Cosmo standing behind the mirror which reflects Janet as he intoned, ""The most desirable creature...that ever walked."" I wish, for my own nostalgic purposes, that version had been included, but no big deal. Over all, thought has been put into this, and the transitions to various menus are a clever use of images from the film.

Unfortunately, there are audio problems. For some reason the audio drops very low during the last chorus of ""Denton USA,"" though the audience claps continue at the same level the rest of the sound had previously played at. Maybe this is a surround sound effect I don't get because I've only got two speakers, but surely there was a way to make the audio compatable with less advanced systems? The audio rises to its previous level for the rest of the movie, so it isn't too bad. But that is the first song, and one of the best, so it puts a damper on the rest of the movie. I've read reviews for the British DVD release which state this movie was also originally in mono, and that fake stereo has been used for the DVD. I don't believe this is accurate, but I'm not sure. The video release was in stereo. I saw the movie at a revival house, in 1984 I think (rather appropriate considering Big Brother is definately watching in this flick), and it sounded like stereo. But then, I was 15 and it was quite some time ago, so maybe memory deceives me. Plus, I can't quite believe Lou Adler would make the same mistake twice. If the movie does turn out to have been originally in mono and an alternative track has been left out, I'll be disappointed.

Also, for some reason, the music over the closing credits has been altered. The movie in theaters and on video had the Overture played again over the credits, and afterwards there was an early demo of Richard O'Brien and Richard Hartley doing the title song with synthesizer accompaniment (for exit music in first release; on video played at first in front of the FBI warning, then against the black screen). For the DVD, the first half of the Overture is chopped off, the demo starts while the cast credits are still running and, because it isn't over when the credits finish, it just fades out instantly. Since this is the one track not on the soundtrack, that's a disappointment. Plus, is it really so bad just to let the audio play over a black screen, or a chosen still, the way other movies that originally contained exit music have been released on DVD? Did anyone complain about this with the video?

Of course, there are audio problems with the Rocky Horror home releases, as well. The Rocky Horror Picture Show was first released in mono and the original tracks are long since lost, so there could never be a genuine stereo reissue. For the video tape, the stereo tracks of the the soundtrack album were substituted with sound effects layed over them, and it sounded terrible: very tinny music quality, with vocals sometimes coming from the speaker on the opposite side of the screen than the characters singing, and at some points, poor lip synching because lines were rendered differently on the soundtrack than in the actual film (sadly, the prints now in circlation at midnight showings use this lame stereo version). The DVD attempt at stereo isn't much better in terms of sound quality, though at least the mono tracks were subsituted in instances where lines were read differently, and better technology allows for the ability to reintroduce sound effects (echos when Brad and Janet enter the church during ""Dammit Janet,"" for instance, or during songs set in the lab) that were always part of the mono and help create verisimilitude. Fortunately, the DVD offered original mono track as an alternative, and is vastly preferable (if you haven't listened to it, please do; the audio on the stereo version sounds pasted over the images, and as I said, it's rather tinny sounding, too, while the song vocals and music tracks and sound effects are nicely blended on the mono, and have a better bass quality; one of Janet's sighs in ""Dammit Janet"" was ommitted from the DVD stereo tracks, by the way).

It's a shame that both movies suffer from audio problems, especially in that they are musicals. It took ten years for Rocky to get a release that included the mono track (and that only after a fake ""mono"" track on the laser disc release that simply squashed the bad stereo onto one channel). I'd be surprised if Shock Treatement's problems get addressed that quickly (this movie hasn't half the following of the other).

I'm really not writing this to dissuade anyone from buying this product. I'm glad I have it, and I think those who've wanted this release for years will be glad to have it. But I did want to make people aware of the flaws.",1157500800,5,6730,4.708828522920204

Where RHPS was an affectionate parody of celuloid horror and seventies excess, ""Shock Treatment"" is a ruthlessly enjoyable stab at 80s commercialism and the trend of life iteself becoming entertainment (and this was nearly 20 years before the whole ""reality show"" wave.)

519104,4,6302795567,"Okay, bad comparison.  But ST is plenty of the latter, which is a pity, because it's actually a very good movie.

The biggest mistake people have when seeing ST is that they expect 'a straight sequel to Rocky'.  With the exception of a few minor elements such as incest and two characters with the names Brad and Janet, the resemblance is hard to find.  The fact is that ST is a completely different movie than RHPS and most viewers come away disappointed because the title is inextricably linked to RHPS (in mind, if not in spirit).

Don't make this mistake.  Erase all RHPS from your mind before viewing.

For starters, in terms of symbolism, ST is Plato's Allegory of the Cave compared to RHPS.  The voyeurism of reality television was not at the extreme degree in 1981 as it is today, making ST's vision a strangely prophetic one.  And yet it all seems very familiar.  The basic premise is that the town of Denton is obsessed with a monster television show, a kind of all-encapsulating collection of programs with a seemingly never-ending time schedule.  Brad and Janet are forced to participate in an isolating reality TV show called Dentonvale, supposedly to help their failing marriage, while two characters whose show has been dropped have uncovered a devastating conspiracy about DTV and must race against the clock to expose it before it's too late.

There is a deep sense of entrapment (the entire movie takes place on the TV set) and irony in ST.  Whereas RHPS was a lighthearted homage to bygone celluloid, ST is a dark, cynical satire on a different kind of picture show, possibly even taking on the original Rocky fans with its portrayal of an audience who does nothing but 'participate' vicariously in the events onscreen.  The movie contains elements, and often messages about, the following exhaustive list: broken relationships, fame (the darker side of), voyeurism, consumerism, conformity, obsession, freedom (the loss, search and gain of), the search for truth, redemption, gender roles, groupies (another stab at the RHPS community), sexuality (in an entirely different manner than RHPS), show biz, American icons, mental health, the relationships between siblings, and of course, reality TV and the sort of bizarre Phil McGraw-solves-all brain cures that populate the airwaves these days.

O'Brien manages to link all these elements with recurring symbolic images (Brad`s cage, the television screens) and symbolic lyrics ('Breaking Out'), then ties it all up in a darkly ironic package and sets it down in the even more ironic setting of a television studio.  When you watch this movie, as well you should, you are watching a screen depicting people watching a screen being watched by a character watching a screen, and the things being depicted on the screens-within-your-screen are satirizing things we see on our screens in real-life everyday; not only that, but the characters watching television are satires of us watching television, which we are, and those characters watching other characters watch television might be us as well, since we are doing the same.  On another mind-bending note, you are also watching a screen depicting a satire of a movie that appeared in so many screens it made possible the creation of the movie you're watching now.  And the fact that you're trapped in this never-ending cycle is also represented symbolically in the movie, so basically, there's no escape.

Confusing?  Yes.  Deliberate?  Probably not, but so much of it is fairly well done and so fun to watch (some people might call it sloppy, but then maybe they weren`t analyzing it for metaphorical content) that it's hard to imagine at least some of it wasn't intentional.  There is still a sort of Rocky-esque flavour hovering around the set, with foreshadowing and important plot points steamrolled over by the seemingly non-sequitor dialogue and zany goings-on, but I didn`t find that this damaged the entertainment value any more than it did RH.  Like RHPS, ST needs a few watchings to get it put in perspective.  But, for aforementioned reasons, most viewers never get that far.

Oh, and the songs were great too.

A FEW NOTES ABOUT THE CAST:

O'Brien never should have used the names Brad and Janet for his leading characters, nor do I think De Young makes a good Brad (though his other role is quite pleasing and he manages to pull a few stunts I can`t imagine Curry doing as well.  Blasphemy, I know).  The roles call for completely different people and Harper and Young, while suffering under the burden of the B and J names which the movie could do without, deliver as best they can (and I maintain, after the ""Looking for Trade"" sequence, that Sarandon could never have pulled this off in her Janet role).  Humphries' saliva-laden Bert Schnicks is the closest character to RHPS aside from O'Brien and Quinn's ever-present brother/sister duo.",1106611200,44,4874,4.972872996300863
519105,4,6302795567,"Anyone claiming ST to be a true sequel to RHPS is being almost as silly as saying Fierce Creatures was a sequel to A Fish Called Wanda.

(Actually, if anything, ST could have been considered a prequel, had the Brad and Janet characters not already been married.) Also comparing boring Barry to boring Cliff is pointless, since the Brad character was supposed to be boring anyway and both did a fine job at it. (Although as a bonus, Cliff in his alter ego station boss role looks like a dead ringer for Timothy ""Dick Deitrich"" Stack.)

The only major difference in this movie was the replacement of the original beloved ""dammit Janet,"" the always cranky-looking Sarandon, with the more wide-ranging Harper. She puts an interesting spin on the role, infusing it with the increasingly debauched (and often sarcastic) attitude it requires, with the sultry and sexy attitude of a Janeane Garofalo (if Janeane could sing, that is).

But one has to ask, why use Brad and Janet at all, then? Good question. This flick would have also been as effective, if not more, without any such RHPS distractions.

Many media shortcomings are lampooned, including the phony star-making (and breaking) system, the always tacky fashion biz, soap operas, rude talk shows, MTV and TV in general. The whole thing was way ahead of it's time (in fact the movie release date, 1981, was the same year MTV had barely begun.)

People seem to be very afraid of accepting this movie because it predicted a dismal conservative media future of rife censorship married to greed-crazy commerce... which actually came true.

The music (with a half dozen solid catchy tunes) and script were both clever, and did indeed seem a natural style which both Richard O'Brian and John Waters might work with together in the future. (To interest Waters, however, the subject would no doubt have to involve serial killers in some way.)

Let nitpicking viewers also bear in mind that while RHPS was produced by Mike White, ST was not (John Goldstone handled those chores this time out).

Okay, now that we've got all of the above straight, let me conclude by pleading with ST's studio, Fox, to please finally release the DVD version! Thank you!",1104883200,17,2193,4.8449197860962565

Anyway, for those of you who want to hear of the movie in itself, Denton (Brad and Janet's hometown) is now a big tv studio.  Each morning, studio audience members arise from their chairs to view the newest game shows.  Brad and Janet (again, nothing like their other characters) are having problems.  Seems brads an emotional reck, and after going on a new game show hosted by crazy blind man bert schnidt, Brad is soon committed to a tv show/psychiatric ward called Dentonvale.  Richard O'Brien and Patricia quinn once again give stunning performances, this time as Cosmo and Nation McKinley (again into the idea of incest).  Little Nell is in the movie as Nurse Ansalong, not too big of a role actually, just eye candy.  Charles Gray however has a much more active role than in the R.H.P.S, and he sings too!  I suppose the main plot is centered around Janet becoming famous to help brad, then forgetting about him completely and becoming too thrilled with being famous.  I highly recommend this, not as being compared to the R.H.P.S (nothing compares with that) but rather as an open minded person who loves looking at weird stuff.",1077494400,13,1587,4.689530685920578

519120,5,6302795567,"...Oooh, Shock Treatment.  Quite possibly the catchiest line from any song included in this film.  Shock Treatment has been cited countless times as a sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  This inaccurate assertion had often to lead to many disappointed viewers who had bought the movie expecting a similar ""erotic nightmare"" which Shock Treatment quite simply isn't.  However, after more than one viewing it is easy to see that Shock Treatment is an outstanding movie in its own right.  Most of the musical numbers are on a par with or better than Rocky Horror, ones to look out for are the title track ""Shock Treatment"", the schizophrenic ""Duel Duet"" and the spectacular ""Look What I did to my Id!""  Althought the plot is slightly obscure, it's lack of clarity is more than made up for by some superb moments, from the tongue in cheek ""Denton, USA"" to the touching sensuality of ""Lullabye"".
The film reunites Patricia Quinn, Laura ""Little Nell"" Cambpell, Richard O Brien, Imogen Claire and many others from The Rocky Horror Picture show.  The onscreen chemistry between Quinn and O'Brien as the incestuous Doctors Nation and Cosmo McKinley lends a quirky and erotic undertone to the movie, which fans and non-fans of Rocky alike will find irresistible, if a little unsettling.  Campbell makes the most of a small amount of dialogue and gives a charming performance as the stunning but sweet Nurse Ansalong.  Jessica Harper and Cliffe DeYoung work well as the quarelling couple, Brad and Janet Majors and Harper gives a believable performance throughout some rather unlikely situations.
In short, this is a very clever satire of ""TV Culture"" which may be confusing at the first viewing but where is may lack strength of plot it more than makes up for in outstanding musical numbers and charm.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish and stands up to repeated viewing.  Although it has not gained the recognition and success of Rocky Horror,  it is more than deserving of its own cult status and dedicated fanbase.  If you learn only one thing from this review let it be this;
Shock Treatment is under no circumstances a sequel to Rocky Horror.  Four of the characters have the same names but the similarities end there.  However, it is a fantastic film in it's own right and there is something in it to entertain more or less everyone.",1037059200,22,2359,4.84788029925187
519121,3,6302795567,"_____As musicals go, this one was acceptable; but as it was hyped as the sequel to the ostentatious RHPS it paled (and failed) in comparison.  On the whole the numbers were pleasing to listen to and the plot of the movie was coherent if a bit 'Distopian' in it's viewpoint. But then there was ""looking for some trade"".
_____At exactly an hour into the picture there is a dream sequence and the musical number ""looking for some trade"". This number was surreal, sultry, seductive and as sexy as .... (to me).  This excellent piece could be pulled out of the movie and, without any editing, stand alone as an old MTV music video.

Brad and Janit return but the original actors are gone,brad's about the same as before but he doesn't get as much screen time and janit is no longer frightend like in the first she's the complete opposite.

Brad ends up on Dentonvale, a reality TV show run by Doctors Cosmo and Nation McKinly (RHPS veterans Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn). As Brad is drugged and dragged off into the care of Nurse Ansalong (RHPS veteran Nell Campbell), Janet finds herself flung headfirst into the heart of the local TV studio,quickly becoming a local celebrity.

519127,1,6302795567,"Richard O'Brien [messed] up on this one.  I love Rocky Horror, but this is just pure novelty.  The plot is thin (so was Rocky's but at least it had cohesion).  The actors are fine, but they all seem to be wandering around wondering why they got mixed up with this ""trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice"" idea.

Supposedly this was always intended to be about American television obsession and how it would eventually lead to lives revolving around the television (and now with reality programming, that's supposedly true). Well, first of all - it was the British who gave us reality television i.e. Survivor....Second, this wasn't the original script for this film. By the time the producers could get the funding together for this film, Susan Sarandon had become a star and Tim Curry was desperate to shed his type casting. So they unwisely decided to scuttle the original script which had Frank coming back to Earth from Transexual for the birth of his and Janet's child. It would have played much better had they gone with that script....

Brad and Janet are TV stars?  Huh?  Riff Raff, Magenta, and Columbia are not themselves but are?  Say what?  There is no Frank-n-furter (and let's face it a Brad double and a sexy Janet just don't work).

Part of the allure of the original is that it was attempting to be a serious musical, but ended up being a cult classic.  You can't create a cult classic.  It doesn't work.  Further, the songs while good aren't up to par with the original either (but then RHPS's songs weren't up to par with the stage musical versions' either).  There are a couple really good ones, but nothing of the original's ""click"".

Oh, there are lots of bright colors (I assume the attempt was to go directly opposite the original's more dark and horror-film like sets and costumes).

Okay - the songs ""Shock Treatment"", ""Little Black Dress"", and a couple others are really great, but they should have been put in a better script.

I went to the theater to see this film. I was a Rocky Horror fan with almost 100 viewings under his belt. The resounding cry of all RHPS fans was singular: Shock Treatment was a rip off! It was no RHPS sequel.

Some of the songs cry out for better treatment than this film gives them. The title song is one that begs for a more stylist ""horror"" approach. Brad should be hooked up to an ECT device in a basement cell rather than the comical cell in which he is held. The verse ""You need a little bit of ooooh Shock treatment..."" should accompany the electric charge being put through his body.

I know there are those that love this film simply because it is SOMETHING that was put out there as a sequel....of sorts...but it just doesn't hold up structurally or musically. The confrontational song between Brad and his twin is pure idiocy on screen, though it plays better as a stand alone song. Little Black Dress is a great song, but doesn't really work within the confines of the film.

On the whole, Shock Treatment is more of a ""talent show"" or musical review than it is a singluar film.

O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, and Nell Campbell (Little Nell in 'Rocky Horror') return, but play different, less interesting characters.

The strongest part of the film is the music, which highlight catchy songs with eye candy visuals to accompany the tunes. After reading about the production, it's obivious alot of the film's shortcomings are due to factors such as casting (trying to get Rocky Horror stars) and having to move location production to England, due to the union strike in the U.S.A. The film had a strong soundtrack written and tried to weave a semblance of a plot around the songs. The producers were probably trying to get a product into the theaters as quickly as possible to capitalize on the midnight movie success of Rocky Horror; however, the film would have benefitted from more plot development, especially in regard to the villain. The actor playing Brad Majors is the biggest drawback; he is a good singer from a Sixties rock band, but is a weak actor and this is amplified by his dual role. It does not help that his villain character is written the weakest and is the film's biggest flaw.

Jessica Harper has a surprisingly great singing voice ( I don't remember her singing in Phantom of Paradise), which carries the film. Several of the women in the film are very attractive and photogenic (one was married to director Steven Soderbergh and another to the Simon guy from American Idle). Nell Campbell wearing a sexy short nurse's skirts, seems to enjoy showing off her legs; her hairstyle totally changes her appearance from the Rocky Horror movie. Also of note, is to see Rik Mayall shortly before he starred in The Young Ones.
The song Breaking Out is one of my favorite parts of the movie, which I wish had been punked up a bit more.

All in all, I enjoyed this movie alot more than I thought I would. The music segments are the selling point of the film and it's interesting to note that this movie was made at the same times as the birth of MTV and the burgeoning prominence of music videos (which is now a bygone era).",1492387200,,2001,4.54016620498615
