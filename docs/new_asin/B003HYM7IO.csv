8397239,4,B003HYM7IO,"I've been waiting to have Barton Yarborough in my collection. On radio he was in I LOVE A MYSTERY,ONE MAN'S FAMILY and of course Radio's Dragnet starting in '49.  We'd see Dragnet on TV at my Aunt & Uncle's house and one day they mention that Yarborough died.
Some of the show's were simulcast so we'd switch on the radio so the home was filled with the sound of dragnet. The Milton Berl episode
is about Berl stealing Jokes from Sid Caesar so Joe Friday is hired. The one with the stolen baby gives actress Peggy Webber (Still alive at 91) a chance to give a tour de force of acting here. The Lee Marvin episode is also very good. Lot's of these show's were a reworking of radio script's. I have 1000's of radio show's and supplied KSFO radio many of them. There are lot's of radio actor's on this TV show which include Ray Burr,Bart Yarborough that's how they bill them. In one episode they make 50 year old Yarborough walk a building ledge instead of young Jack Webb. overall the show's are good. The bonus includes 2 radio show's Dragnet & The Jack Webb radio show geared toward comedy and was from San Francisco. I have 2 audio cassettes of this show, there not bad. I believe you'll feel that you got your money's worth here. No subtitles though.",1488153600,,1252,4.396551724137931

8397243,3,B003HYM7IO,"The episodes are as stated and I enjoy seeing them.  The first TV Dragnet episode is better than some of the later ones script-wise.  The 16mm prints these were copied from are ones that were used by TV stations and some still have the Fatima (Fah-tee-ma) and Chesterfield cigarette commercials left in.  The sound has background flutter from the optical soundtracks on the old film and of course the editors' punch marks are very evident.  The picture quality is OK for shows that are over 50 years old.
The Milton Berle show with Jack Webb as guest is OK and it is interesting to see Jack Webb in a live show.  Although ""Uncle Miltie"" was know as ""Mr. Television"" you would never know it from the content of this show, it is amazing what we considered ""good"" TV back then (and I am old enough to have seen the originals but I did not watch Berle as a kid, thought he was not very funny).
There is one really interesting bit of TV history, you get to see Selma Diamond as a young lady.  She was a script writer for Berle.  You may recall her as the first female bailiff on ""Night Court"" with her ever present cigarette (she has one burning in an ashtray in her scene in the show here).
I would like to see someone get the rights to the original Mark VII negatives or at least 35mm prints of the DRAGNET shows and put out a decent COMPLETE set (or separate sets) of DRAGNET DVDs.  Even if they did not restore them it would be better than these old 16mm prints.  There were over 270 episodes and I would like to see them all not just the 20 - 30 available now.",1339027200,7,1560,4.243243243243243
