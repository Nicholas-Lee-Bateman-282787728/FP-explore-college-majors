2700633,5,B000L7XMJ8,"While I very much enjoyed the DVD, some of it made me a bit angry also. I knew there were bigots around, however I did not realize how much it affected the jazz scene in Southern California until I watched this DVD. Poor fools, because of your foolishness you blew your chance to see people like Miles Davis and many other great black artists in their PRIME all because of their skin color. Some later played at the Lighthouse in the 1960's but think of what might have been had these great black artists been allowed free access to the club in the 1950's. This is WHY racism has got to STOP NOW. It kills the dreams of many good, well meaning people. Look past ones COLOR....Do it NOW AMERICA.",1270512000,,694,4.346153846153846
2700634,5,B000L7XMJ8,"It was an unlikely setting for a world famous jazz club. Nearly an hour's drive from downtown L.A. (in the days before the freeway system was completed), and located in a somewhat seedy bar a half block from the beach, the Lighthouse Cafe nonetheless became a magnet for modern jazz lovers the world over. Thanks to the tireless efforts of owner John Levine and musical director/bandleader Howard Rumsey, the club developed into a center for the burgeoning West coast Jazz movement of the 1950s. Fans from Europe and Japan would tavel halfway around the world just to catch a couple of sets.

Ken Koenig catches the ambiance of those halcyon days in loving detail, but there is much more to his film. The DVD affords a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the day to day operations of a jazz club, and features interviews with many of the musicians, bartenders, and waitresses who were instrumental in the club's success. Chances are you'll be surprised at the amount of hard, extra-musical work necessary for running a successful jazz club. For instance, Levine and Rumsy joined the Hermosa Beach Chamber of Commerce help turn the initially reluctant and even hostile city fathers into enthusiastic supporters of the club.

Above all, the ongoing conversation with Howard Rumsey, the perpetually youthful and articulate spokesman for jazz, is in itself worth the price of admission. If you've ever wondered about the term West Coast Jazz, or wanted to know what the jazz scene in southern California was like in the 1950s, this is your chance to find out. And, I might add, have a very enjoyable viewing and listening experience at the same time.",1199923200,4,1653,4.963898916967509
2700635,5,B000L7XMJ8,"Modern jazz in California evolved in two metropolitan areas, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Film maker Ken Koenig has focused on the LA area, or more specifically, Hermosa Beach, where bassist Howard Rumsey nurtured his Lighthouse All Stars group who would become internationally known through their recordings on the Contemporary label.

Koenig has interviewed dozens of musicians, jazz scholars, fans, and employees who knew the Lighthouse intimately during its heyday and has assembled the Lighthouse story in an engaging film that chronicles the emergence of modern jazz in California.  Rare photographs and archival live footage complement this authoritative documentary.

Hopefully this is the first installment of Koenig's examination of jazz on the west coast with many more to come in the future.

2700636,5,B000L7XMJ8,"If you ever saw The Lighthouse Allstars at The Lighthouse Cafe in Hermosa Beach, or if you have a sweet spot for west coast jazz, this film will thrill you.  It's a great story that brings those precious 20 years back to life.",1198281600,,226,4.255813953488372
2700637,5,B000L7XMJ8,"A few years ago, I was seated in a bus riding from Los Angeles to Hermosa Beach to see the Phil Norman Tentet play at the Lighthouse Caf, a shrine for jazz fans.  I had been there once for a brief look see a year or two earlier, but there was no music going on - I just wanted to see the place.  Seated next to me was another attendee at the four-day jazz event that I was attending, a stranger to me.  We got to talking, and it turned out that it was a chap named Ken Koenig.  He informed me that he was in the process of making a documentary about this jazz Mecca that we were about to visit.

Well, that film is now available as ""Jazz on the West Coast: The Lighthouse,"" and it is a gas.  Combining still photos, film clips and interviews, Koenig has created an affectionate and interesting portrait of this cauldron of West Coast Jazz.

Koenig has definitely done his homework well.  He draws extensively from the interviews that he did with the musical guiding light of the club, bassist Howard Rumsey. The interviews are presented in a more complete form as a bonus feature on the DVD.  Rumsey, now approaching 89 years of age, although he has the presence of a much younger man, has total recall about his days at the Lighthouse, and shares that information in a thorough and engaging manner.  Among the other voices heard from are musicians Max Bennett, Milt Bernhart, Bill Holman, Bud Shank and Stan Levey.  There are also recollections and commentary from Ross Levine, son of the club's owner John Levine, Los Angeles Jazz Institute Director Ken Poston, musicologist Robert Hughes, jazz photographer William Claxton, Lighthouse bartender Ken Kolar, jazz journalist Kirk Silsbee and jazz historian Robert Gordon.  Together with the script that Koenig has skillfully written to cohere the disparate components, the interviews, stills and performance footage provide a comprehensive view of the scene that gave rise to and nurtured this important piece of jazz history.

Jazz came to the Lighthouse as a result of Rumsey's desire to get back actively into the Los Angeles jazz scene.  He had been a member of the early Stan Kenton Orchestras, but had grown away from the music business to follow other pursuits.  He was seeking a venue where he could organize jam sessions featuring modern jazz.  One Sunday afternoon in 1949, he wandered into a sparsely populated restaurant/bar that had once been a haven for local seamen right near the ocean in Hermosa Beach, a coastal community located just south of Los Angeles.  The Lighthouse had a stage that seemed appropriate for Rumsey's dream, so he approached owner John Levine, and suggested that he allow Rumsey to organize Sunday Afternoon jam sessions.  Levine somewhat reluctantly agreed, and on May 29, 1949, the Lighthouse started on its way to becoming the most important jazz venue in the Los Angeles area.

Rumsey's belief that a venue featuring modern jazz could succeed in one of the beach communities proved to be valid.  From the Sunday afternoon when they opened the front doors and let the sounds of bebop waft above the beach crowds, the customers started coming.  Rumsey also started to play jazz records in the Lighthouse on weekday evenings, but soon convinced Levine to let him bring in live jazz for the evenings.  This began a 22-year relationship during which the Lighthouse achieved world-wide recognition as one of the great jazz clubs extant.

Koenig has done a masterful job of conveying the story of a special place and time in jazz.  Yes, you learn the facts, but you also hear some of the music and get a real sense of the unique ambience that the Lighthouse provided for the enjoyment of the music that was played there, music that was creative, entertaining and significant.  Jazz on the West Coast: The Lighthouse is a love song to this special club and the music that came to life there.  I guarantee that you will watch it again and again.  It will not only keep calling you back, but will compel you to seek out more of the music that you get a taste of in the film.",1197849600,9,4057,4.693502824858757
2700638,5,B000L7XMJ8,"West Coast Jazz is like the crazy Uncle locked in the basement: There's lots of evidence of its existance, but not a lot of formal acknowledgement... The exception here is this very important and informative DVD documentary by Ken Koenig, which, unfortunately, is not well known or distributed.  As a huge fan of the California Sound of the 50s and 60s, I always thought it was odd that there's so little information about it on the internet and elsewhere.  This Documentary is an excellent place to start.  The Lighthouse was a divey, beach-front bar in Hermosa Beach, California.  In the early 1950s it became one of the cornerstones of Southern California Jazz.  Howard Rumsey, a bassist, and friend of owner John Levine, was charged with having a jazz group on stage jamming every night.  The players in his ""Light House All Stars"", as the band became known, turned out to be a who's who of West Coast Jazz.  Many albums were recorded on the Contemporary Records label that recorded live sessions of the group on a fairly regular basis during 1952-1957.  Regulars included such major players as Shorty Rogers, Maynard Ferguson, Rolf Ericson, Stu Williamson, Conte Candoli, Milt Bernhart, Bob Enevoldsen, Frank Rosolino, Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Cooper, Bud Shank, Hampton Hawes, Marty Paich, Claude Williamson, Sonny Clark, Shelly Manne, Max Roach, Stan Levey, and guests Miles Davis and Chet Baker were among the participants.....  The DVD features lots of insights from Rumsey himself, interspersed with rare vintage pictures and additional commentary from bartenders, waitresses, musicians and patrons of the famous polynesian-styled jazz bar.  Whether you are a student of jazz, or a casually interested music fan, chances are this will be material you've never seen nor heard before, and extremely well worth the 80 minutes of your time!",1169683200,17,1840,5.144295302013423

8160342,2,B000L7XMJ8,"I'd heard about Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse but, as a non-Californian, had no first-hand experience in  the club or, for that matter, L.A.  We learn that the club's owner was a man named John Levine (whose biography receives more attention than the musicians') and that it was Rumsey who approached Levine about using the club as a mecca for jazz musicians in the 1950s, when Stan Kenton's musicians were off the road to stay and over-zealous police were closing down the clubs on Central Ave., where black musicians had played in the '40s (we're told that some found their way to the Lighthouse but soon felt unwelcome and left.  So where did they go?)

This film repeated much of what I already knew, some of what I didn't know, and a lot about what I didn't need to know.  The film seems to be on drugs--""downers"" like heroin (definitely not cocaine).  There's a kind of ""audio patina"" over the microphone that not only covers up and distances us from the film's talking heads but homogenizes them, making each blend together in an indistinct, bland and unseasoned chorus of droning voices (same deliberative monotone, same vocabulary, same delivery).  A few speakers suddenly chuckle over their own recollections but just as suddenly catch themselves in time to return us to the film's insistent sobriety.

Anything resembling ""excitement"" is purely accidental. A newcomer might wonder--if the film's speakers are a reflection of the music, who cares?  Anything resembling real jazz--West Coast or East Coast--is reduced to anonymous background music playing non-stop behind the film's chosen group of talking heads, practically each of whom wears out his welcome after the first 2 or 3 interview clips.  Levine was the owner and business mind, and Rumsey was the music scheduler and bass player who lent his name to the collections of all-star musicians--including seminal, true giants like Maynard Ferguson, Shorty Rogers, Max Roach and even Charlie Parker (the latter two obviously away from their usual Coast).  In exchange for his work on the entertainment, Rumsey tells us that Levine fathered him into the ways of business, even getting him to join the Chamber of Commerce (which paid off later in a Lighthouse-sponsored beauty contest with Stan Kenton as one of the judges).

Apart from locals who remember club sessions and who recognize the photographs of jazz greats (Maynard Ferguson, Chet Baker, Wardell Grey), the film would seem to serve little purpose--other than as a certain cure for insomnia.  I don't mean to be overly harsh on a project that may have required considerable effort and time to assemble.  But in these latter days of jazz, a film like this would be a total disaster if shown to students in an introductory class to the music.  The best scene by far is that of a filmed sequence of a live session (the tune, as I recall, is ""All the Things You Are,"" though the soundtrack makes it difficult to distinguish this music from the limpid background jazz that's been running throughout the film).  At the very least, the sequence proves that Howard Rumsey could and did actually play bass with the all-stars (I was even able to discern distinct and correct pitches from his instrument).

On the whole, the film left me feeling sad about the scandalously poor documentation of America's most important (arguably, only) indigenous musical art.  True, there are more noteworthy jazz albums than any one listener has time in a single lifetime to listen to.  But when it comes to filming a music of such drama, color, and ""high energy"" appeal, the music and the American public have both been let down. (My dream has long been to locate a single visual clip of tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, at one time pronounced by Down Beat Magazine the ""most recorded saxophonist in jazz.""  I'm afraid that it's a dream forever deferred.)

P.S. It's probably a good thing that legendary clubs like Birdland (the original), the Vanguard, and the Lighthouse along with the owners and sponsors who braved this unprofitable music, receive recognition--even in films that are way behind the curve in production values.  But as a Midwesterner it galls me that one of the most tireless, passionate, and persistent champions of this African-American musical art form is rarely acknowledged for his enormous contributions and sacrifices on behalf of the music.  Since 1946 Joe Segal has made it his life's mission to bring the best jazz in the world to Chicago's Jazz Showcase, and he can still be found at the door, dispensing tickets, weighing the night's admission fees against his costs, and somehow making it work. In the '70s Segal lined up the best jazz heard anywhere--programs with 4 tenor giants from both coasts on the bandstand. And when they all seemed to be dying of lung cancer, Segal stunned us all around 1990 by being one of the first to enforce a ""no-smoking"" policy. That's the movie that should have been in the making, especially when, in a jazz-hostile climate, Segal refused to abandon his post as captain of the ship on the mainstream of modern jazz.",1442707200,,5080,4.929660023446659

8160345,5,B000L7XMJ8,"I bought Ken Koenig's dvd for the personal connection I had with this place. 1951 - 1958 I was 8-13 years old living in neighboring Manhattan Beach. I don't recall exactly when but I wandered down 3 blocks to the pier in Hermosa and heard these mesmerizing horns and drums (sorry Howard) coming out of a little hole in the next to a big hotel. I followed the lemmings (all in our swim suits) to these exhilarating sounds that pulsated through our entire bodies in the warm California sun. West Coast Jazz? East Coast Jazz? I'll leave such interpretations to journalists more knowledgeable than myself. I just know that I heard Shorty, Bud, Coop, Shelly and assorted other big names that I have come to appreciate more over time. You can catch some of these classic performances on ""Frankly Jazz"" through You Tube. Shorty also lives in several of the old Peter Gunn tv shows and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the early Bruce Brown surf flicks ""Slippery When Wet"" & ""Barefoot Adventure"" highlighting the talents of Bud Shank and Bob Cooper. For me it was like church every Sunday afternoon. As an old retired guy at this stage of the game I think it's up to us as individuals to make our own ""Lighthouses"" even if it's only by way of computers.

I found it very interesting and great to see some old pictures of that area of Hermosa Beach as well as my Aunt Esther.

Jazz is not my taste in music so I was please this documentary was more about the musicians than just a bunch of music.",1363046400,,461,4.111111111111111
8160348,5,B000L7XMJ8,"What also needs to be emphasized is the role the Lighthouse played in bringing some of the best jazz musicians into Los Angeles.  During its heyday, there were many other jazz clubs here (regardless what ""West Coast Jazz"" author says about ""dearth"" of good jazz during the 60's in L.A.).  Probably the best of the rest is Shelly's Mannehole which also competed for out of town stars.

But I consider the best booking ever played at the Lighthouse was in the spring of 1962 when Dizzy Gillespie's band with Leo Wright, Lalo Schiffren, Chris White and Candy Finch had a run.  I was there with a musician buddy of mine from UCLA on Sunday from 2 P.M. until closing.  The joint was packed from the opening and I doubt that anyone ever left either!  The band just blew the roof off and everyone loved Dizzy.  As proof of how cool the staff was, my buddy got away without ordering a thing explaining that he had just had four wisdom teeth removed.  Well the next week I was walking back to my dorm after an evening class and stopped at Royce Hall to catch a little of the Philadelphia Orchestra with Eugene Ormandy.  In the wings, I saw a lot of the same crowd that had been catching Dizzy on Sunday.  I'm sure they were L.A. studio musicians.  The jazz fans in L.A. had it great during the Lighthouse's tenure.  God bless Howard Rumsey!",1343952000,,1331,4.432098765432099
8160349,2,B000L7XMJ8,"If you are expecting video clips of the essential performers of the Lighthouse All Stars era then I would suggest you look elsewhere. Perhaps five of the eighty minutes could be considered performance video. Most doesn't include the Lighthouse All Star  key players in any significant way and mostly only pieces of tunes. I believe this was a missed opportunity to present a major video representation of  West Coast Jazz performance. However, if your interest is in an abundance of talk about something you can neither see nor hear this may be the DVD for you.  However you will see some snapshots, a few excellent Bill Claxton photographs, but a lot more album covers of the variety you can see in used LP venues. Howard Rumsey, the bassist with most of the Lighthouse All Star recordings, provides a running history on how the Lighthouse evolved.",1282694400,3,849,4.841379310344828
