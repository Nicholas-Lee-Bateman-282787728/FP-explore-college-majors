8372707,2,B002LFPBL0,"I can accept the fact that ""Oil on Water"" is well-meaning, but it is so full of clichs that it ultimately does little service to its subject.  It is a superficially pretty movie, but it boils down to a soap opera about schizophrenia.

Max and Anna are seemingly a perfect couple.  They are young and attractive; he's a talented artist, she's an aspiring writer with a social conscience.  They live in a nice housing unit with beautiful appurtenances, and they have plenty of young, affluent friends.  They met when Anna posed as a model for a drawing class.  Both appear to be in their mid-twenties.  They seem to be on their way to building a nice life, when Max starts hearing voices whispering in his head and begins to withdraw from Anna.

A good film dealing with schizophrenia would be welcome from any quarter, but this film is so shallow that it doesn't qualify.  The movie follows Anna as she journals her thoughts, and most of them are platitudes that could have been pulled from ""Jonathan Livingstone Seagull"".  An added irritation is that whenever she pours forth with these truisms, it's to the accompaniment of bland, ""spiritually enlightened"" MOR radio music.

For ""Max"", the film director seems to have found an actor who resembles most people's idea of Jesus Christ.  He's thin, blue-eyed, beautiful, and he also spouts pseudo-profound thoughts.  He also creates beautiful artworks, but when he starts hearing demonic voices, his artwork becomes tortured and hellish...but with beautiful calligraphy intact.

People knowledgeable about schizophrenia know that it most often presents symptoms in the late teens---not in childhood, or in the mid-twenties, as this film would have it.  There is an entire spectrum or range of severity in schizophrenia, and many victims never have auditory hallucinations.  But Max has both auditory and visual hallucinations (which are not common to the disease).  And he continues to create art with ease, when most untreated schizophrenics can't get organized enough to do anything at all.  And the incidence of schizophrenia occurring when one parent has the disease is about 15%--- when Max's father apparently batted a thousand and produced two schizophrenic sons.  Links between mental illness and creativity have been studied, but it's doubtful that creative people have a much higher incidence of schizophrenia than the general population.

Max, Anna, and their friends seem blissfully unaware of mental illness (there's one strange homeless man who is seen in a couple scenes...how could madness strike the privileged, the film seems to ask), and it isn't until the last twenty minutes of the film that there is any ""coming to grips"" with the situation.

Everything is SO PRETTY.  And madness is SO INCONVENIENT.

And of course it ends tragically--- without treatment.  But Christ-like Max has left his artwork to enlighten the rest of the world.  How nice.  Now everyone can get back to their chats and their yoga classes.

And of course, the filmmakers want to take a bow for the social service they have provided, and do so in the extras...when all they did was make a film in which any and all messages are lost in greeting card perfection.

Such a waste.",1427068800,2,3216,5.016981132075472
