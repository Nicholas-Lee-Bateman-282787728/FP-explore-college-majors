This movie is unique in that it was almost entirely produced by women. The music, the cinematography, the direction, the acting -- all women. It's an in-your-face, straight up live action rendition of a manga by the same name.

Anna Tsuchiya shines as Kiyoha, and the movie beautifully blends traditional Japanese imagery, architecture, and fashion with modern colors and patterns. They accentuate the exotic and intriguing nature of the old pleasure quarters of Edo Era Japan.

It is both a wonderful cultural glimpse at Japan and eye candy at the same time. A treat, to be sure!",1222905600,,741,4.959677419354839
8277915,5,B000YIBR8W,"I'm a huge fan of Anna Tsuchiya. After watching Kamikaze Girls long time ago, I was hooked on this beautiful woman. She's young, talented, and very sexy in every sense of the word. Her music is incredible and moves my soul. However, after Kamikaze Girls, I got ahold of her music career(and lots of it) with many singles and albums. It then hit me, ""I want more of her acting!"" I already had Kamikaze Girls, plus the anna3 DVD which is basically a look at Anna the person. I looked up one of her recent titles called Sakuran. After buying it and watching it, I realized that Anna has scored once again.

Sakuran is a world full of beauty, but dirty on the inside. It takes place in a courtesan district of Yoshiwara, during the Edo period. Colors are vivid in this movie, to reflect on the story. Vibrant colors to express the passion and sexuality of the women, which works VERY well. As you know, Anna fits well in this movie because of it's sexuality. She's full of sex appeal, and plays a very striking character named Kiyoha.

She begins as a rebellious and rude little girl, growing up in the middle of this passionate enviornment. Hating it at first, she hopes to escape from it all. Eventually, to prove herself she grows to become a sassy and gorgeous courtesan herself! BTW, she's 17 by this time and boy she's the best looking 17 year old anyone has ever seen ^_^

To not spoil much, pretty soon she starts to go through love and the never ending battle to be free. Goldfish are symbolic throughout the whole movie, and always used as a transition. As long as these concubines(the goldfish) remain inside the district(bowl) they will remain beautiful forever. But outside of it, they will perish.

This movie is modern, beautiful, easy on the eyes, passionate, and very stimulating. Anna Tsuchiya carried the film big time, and it's definately for Anna fans. The Goldfish are adorible too BTW ^o^I'm a sucker for fantails. If you loved Kamikaze Girls, you'll adore Sakuran. It's a complex story, in a sleezy world.

Note: Sakuran is also a manga! Watch out for that too!",1195171200,3,2081,4.598382749326146
