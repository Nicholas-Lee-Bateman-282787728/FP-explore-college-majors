8110620,5,B000EJ9NIW,"Very good blu-ray of a chilling, unsettling (and admittedly frustrating) film about a couple under surveillance by a mysterious observer. Outstanding performances, crisp cool direction. One of the best films in recent years.",1501113600,,224,5.818181818181818
8110621,5,B000EJ9NIW,"Love this movie! Looks absolutely fantastic on blu! Be aware, only the movie will play- the special features won't play on USA blu Ray players. Kind of a drag- after watching the movie I really wanted to watch the special features.",1452988800,,231,4.658536585365853
8110622,5,B000EJ9NIW,"Georges and Anne Laurent have a great life: Georges is a successful television host of a book discussion and review program and Ann does book and author p.r. They have a beautiful home and a smart and caring, 12 year old son, Pierrot. Then one day a package arrives containing a vhs tape wrapped in a drawing of a blood spattered man. The tape is of Georges and Ann's house, taken from across the street: they are being watched. But by whom and why? The packages continue to arrive, the tapes become more confrontational and the drawings more graphic.

Director and Screenwriter, Michael Haneke (the controversial and blatantly sexual ""The Piano Teacher"") is operating on several levels and his motives are almost entirely implicit though ""Cache'"" on a very basic level is very tightly wound, suspenseful and operates on the very highest level of intelligence: as in the very best films, Haneke shows rather than tells us.

As the movie progresses and the tapes become more personal, Georges is forced to confront the sins of his past and that of his family towards an Algerian orphan, Majid who once lived with Georges family.

Haneke is on a first name basis with Obsession and the obsessive personality: the wheres, the whys and the hows. ""The Piano Teacher"" is nothing if not a treatise on the big ""O."" Deeply hidden in the bowels of his psyche, Georges guilt also becomes an obsession: is he a participant in his own victimization? Is he sending himself the tapes and the gruesome pictures as a way of expiating his guilt?

""Cache'"" addresses the French Algerians ongoing conflict with the French government both socially and morally, issues of personal and collective Guilt as well as the complicated morass of wife/husband relationships... particularly those dealing with communication or lack thereof.

The films ambiguous final scene shot at Pierrot's school at the end of the school day with students mingling, talking, joking with each other,just being young...is troubling and infuriating in its dense obtuseness; particularly when Majid's son shows up: there are at least four ways of interpreting this scene and each one can be supported by what is up on the screen: masterful.

""Cache'"" is a refined, intelligent and difficult film. Haneke does not offer any easy answers and absolutely no solutions nor does he allow his characters any absolution. The road here is jammed with moral pot holes and danger signs. Proceed with caution: ""Cache's"" journey may be difficult but the destination is rife with relevant and well observed lives in turmoil.",1445472000,,2561,5.0
8110623,5,B000EJ9NIW,"A brilliant film made by genius perfectionist filmmaker Michael Haneke.
His style is very different - don't expect a conventional film.",1434585600,,135,5.476190476190476
8110624,3,B000EJ9NIW,"I found this French film directed by Michael Haneke rather dull, boring and confusing. I'm not aware of having seen anything else of his but I certainly wouldn't rush to watch anything else under his direction. The story-line, such as it is, is about a couple, Georges and Anne Laurent (Daniel Auteuil, Juliette Binoche), who start receiving video tapes of themselves coming and going to and from their apartment. Georges is an anchor-man for a TV book review show and Anne is a literary editor. The mystery is, who would make and send these tapes and why? The problem is never satisfactorily answered. Suspicion falls on a lad who was adopted into Georges' family, and then onto his son, but both deny the accusation. The Laurents' teenage son Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky) goes missing for a while, presumed abducted, and this adds a frisson of excitement. Juliette Binoche is lovely, and her and Auteuil's acting make the film watchable but this is certainly not one of my top ten thrillers.",1376265600,,992,4.875739644970414
8110625,2,B000EJ9NIW,"This is a poor film. The storyline seems to have potential at the start but totally fails to deliver. The biggest flaw in the film for me was that I failed to make any kind of connection with the main characters especially that of George (Daniel Auteil). I had no empathy for them whatsoever which turned into a disinterest as the film rolled on. I've no problems with Juliet Binoche, she is a brilliant actress and did what she was asked but in this instance it was far too little. She is capable of conveying so much more feeling than this. In my opinion the weakness of this film is due to the director, the story is ok and could have been so much better. One final note which I did not like about the film; there is a scene where a cockerel clearly has it's head cut off. Although this happens throughout the world everyday I thought the days of harming animals for films had passed us by.",1350777600,,893,4.289940828402367
8110626,4,B000EJ9NIW,"The movie is superb and rates 5 stars.

Amazon is remiss however in not telling potential U.S. buyers that, although the Blu Ray of the movie is region free, the extras are all on a PAL compatible disc that will not play on U.S. Region 1 Blu Ray players.

Hopefully a U.S. Blu Ray edition is in the works.",1343174400,15,305,4.1525423728813555
