7936516,5,B00005B1YA,This is not a dramatic enactment. Primarily it's Mr. Heston reading Scripture relating directly to The Passion of our Lord. There are only four DVDs in the series -- would have been nice to have the WHOLE Bible. It's recorded on location with a majestic presentation by Mr. Heston.,1367884800,3,281,4.755102040816326
