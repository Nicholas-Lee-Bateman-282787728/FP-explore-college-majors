2703882,5,B000LC57RS,"Night after night Johnny would come into our homes and visit with us bringing with the best musical guests, Hollywood great and just some intering folks with him. I grew up with Johnny I would stay up to watch him. May 22,1992 was a sad night it was the last time he would stop by even thought he said he might be back if he found something worthwhile except for a visit on the David Letterman show soon after his last show, he never show up again. Fun thing about the Letterman show when he walked out he had cardboard under his arm he sat down and the unfolded what would be a make shift desk telling he felt naked without it. Here we see some of the great highlights from the last two decade of his run. Now if you want to see where latent talk shows started and late night at its best look no further here it is. I just loved Johnny he could talk to anyone from Presidents to simple people who May have done something interesting. Johnny was always tasteful and always looked for the laugh at times he was at his best when the jokes just didn't work so well. He was such a natural at putting at ease. And then there were those skits he would do I think the only one that comes close is David Letterman. Johnny was an American treasure who is missed dearly but thanks to dads like this he can live on one did at a time. If you got to see Johnny at his best than you owe it to yourself to have this master drop by for a visit.",1357862400,,1428,4.049469964664311
2703883,4,B000LC57RS,"The DVD is well-produced with numerous segments.  It is funny and entertaining, and a little touching with portions of the last show.  The skits are probably a little better in this production than those chosen in the similar DVD of the 60s and 70s.  The DVD is only about an hour, which seems a little brief.",1286841600,4,309,4.482142857142857
2703884,4,B000LC57RS,"""The Ultimate Carson Collection:  Volume 2""  is a great gift for Carson lovers.  It covers the 1980-1999 time period of ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"".  The eclectic skits and good-natured fun with guests show why the show was a consistent hit.  A lot of the best moments (there are far too many to be put on one DVD) are caught.  The absolute lunacy of Carson with guests is a great uplift when you need it.  He has great timing and ""garnishes the guests jokes with a nice polish.  There are early stand-up appearances from Roseanne, David Letterman, and Eddie Murphy.

The disk has some behind the scenes features, but the best part was a nostalgic trip in 1982 back to Norfolk Nebraska.  Though born in Iowa, Johnny was raised in Norfolk, a typical all-American small town.  I was surprised on how the private man revealed much about his childhood and beginnings with sincere  heartfelt narration.  You can feel the nostalgia for his roots, family, friends and teachers .  He tours in the car his father bought and he learned to drive in.  It is a  interesting and worthwhile story.

Johnny's unique charisma and wit still come through.",1283299200,,1150,4.7272727272727275
2703885,5,B000LC57RS,This is so much fun. Makes us remember how much we miss Johnny.  Our only regret is that there are just clips on these videos.  Wish there was someway to purchase entire shows.,1225670400,4,176,4.303030303030303
