8005149,5,B00011D1IQ,"I just purchased Chris Barber,s Jazz & Blues Band: On the Road and found this DVD as well. The first half of the concert is with his original band with Lonnie Donegan on banjo and Monty Sunshine playing the clarinet. All the other original artists were there too. I remembered going to local pubs and dance clubs in England when I was in my late teens to see Chris Barber and all the original players before they became famous worldwide. It brought tears to my eyes just watching and listening to the original Dixieland Jazz being performed once again. Many of the original band members have sadly passed away since this concert. The second half of the concert is dedicated to Chris Barber's Jazz & Blues Band and is quite different than the first half. I was pleasantly surprised at the contrast and really enjoyed the Blues Band as much as the original players. Chris Barber is a gifted musician and I have never yet heard his equal playing the trombone. He also sings and once again he played the double bass during one of the numbers. There is also an incredible drum solo during the second half of the concert plus all the performers get their solo's as well. If you are a dixieland jazz fan then this DVD will give you a couple of hours of incredible talent and music.",1425427200,,1274,4.495689655172414

I particularly enjoyed the Monty Sunshine solos in the '1954 Band' segment, and ""Big Noise From Winnetka"" was a real treat in the Jazz and Blues Band (1995 Group) show.  Very good music and whole a lot of fun!",1384387200,,350,4.4375

40 Years Jubilee Concert, Aarhus, Denmark, 1995
Without comparison the Chris Barber Original Jazzband is the most popular traditional jazz band from 1954 till today. Here we see and hear the ""1954 good old boys"" with Barber, and among others, Lonnie Donegan and Monty Sunshine - and furthermore of course, his very good general Jazz And Blues Band where Pat Halcox is ""still going strong"" on trumpet.",1079481600,4,420,5.0
