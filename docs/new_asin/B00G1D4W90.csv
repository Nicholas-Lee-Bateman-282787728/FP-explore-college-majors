8620046,5,B00G1D4W90,"At last the hit comedy is back with another six episodes of nostalgic Irish fun. Martin Moone has an imaginary friend Sean played by co-writer and great actor Chris O'Dowd. This series picks up where the last left off. Martin is now going to `Big School' along with best mate and part time cross dresser Padraic. His eldest sister is now heavy with child thanks to the less than charismatic religious organiser and loud shirt wearing Dessie.

This time the situations will range from Irelands' entry to the Football World Cup in 1990 and a less than idyllic family holiday. Martins first day at school, his first love with a free wheelin `art teacher'; and the school disco sans alcohol but very much avec embarrassment. An ingenious if unreliable ghost ship for the Halloween special - watch out for Jonny Vegas playing invisible friend `Crunchie Haystacks'. Ireland's answer to squash with a show down of handball where Simon Day plays a golfing ghost, the wedding and a group of travellers moving in to the field next to the Moones'.

I loved the first series and downloaded these as they became available and they are every bit as good as the first outing. All the same actors play all the main characters and it is hard to single anyone out as being brilliant as they all put in such great performances which just compliment each other. Whilst still not as big as it ought to be I feel with the rise of Chris O'Dowd as a recognised talent it is only a matter of time before these little gems get the full attention they most definitely deserve.
P.S. I have no idea what the Christmas fudge thing is all about - just see it as icing on the cake and the editorial above appears to be referring to Thomas the Tank Engine which this most certainly is not.",1397260800,,1756,4.5362776025236595
