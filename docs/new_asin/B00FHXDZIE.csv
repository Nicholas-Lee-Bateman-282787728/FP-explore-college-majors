The movie has little conversation just the actions and expressions of the actors.  The scenery seems to match the plot, enchanting yet dangerous.  The theme of the movie, I believe, is the burning desire of the human to survive.  We sometimes go through great pain, yet the will to live can cause us to do things we may have thought not possible.  Cornell Wilde takes us through such an experience.  You won't waste your time watching this movie.",1403827200,,555,4.435643564356436
