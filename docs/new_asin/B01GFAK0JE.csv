7759774,4,B01GFAK0JE,I enjoyed this Korean take on exorcism. Well shot and unusually beautiful cinematography. I found both the priest and his apprentice interesting. This is worth the watch.,1512086400,4,170,5.333333333333333
7759775,5,B01GFAK0JE,"I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Gang Dong-won. Although I'm not usually fond of horror movies, I found this one was interesting enough to keep me engaged without putting me off with cheesy jump-scares. Audio in Korean, with English subtitles--some commented that the subtitles were slow, but there was no delay for me.",1511913600,4,328,4.875
7759776,5,B01GFAK0JE,"The cover  should have been more like the original Korean cover.  It puts you off and makes it seem more cheezy.
 Korean movies are getting better and more fun to watch. The 2 main actors from  Woochie are in this movie.  They both are dark and flawed yet come through in the end.  Their imperfections make them more relatable. The twists and turns add more to the story.  Pay attention to the clues so that you understand why things are happening later on.  Give it a try you might enjoy it.",1501372800,6,492,4.329670329670329

7759778,4,B01GFAK0JE,"Father Kim has been conducting exorcisms in Seoul, no pun intended. He has gone through a number of assistants and they are down to candidates from seminary school. Deacon Choi has been asked to be the next one, having a loose list of qualifications, one is being born in the year of the tiger. There was also been a question of molestation and in addition to assisting Kim, he also must spy on him.

While this is a serious exorcism film, it does have many light moments. The dialogue was good, in spite of the English dubbing. The Korean culture comes through as we see a shaman with an ox head strapped to his back attempt an exorcism. In one scene as they prepare for an exorcism and take communion, Father Kim quips to Choi that he could have bought a better wine. It was that type of humor that was in much of the feature. I don't believe this is an ""everyone"" film due to the dubbing and length, as some may find it difficult to sit through.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. There is a Korean option with English subtitles, or just plain English, with the opening monologue still being in Korean with English subtitles.",1486512000,5,1123,4.420289855072464
7759779,4,B01GFAK0JE,"It's a nice movie if u like exorcism movies such as 'exorcism of emily rose' or 'the exorcist'.
honestly I hesitated before watching this movie because of the gruesome poster which looks like B horror movie but glad to see it.
give 4 star cause the subtitle is little bit late compare to the audio.",1478563200,5,298,4.4363636363636365
7759790,5,B01GFAK0JE,"Super good movie! So wish could watch without having to read subtitles because was so very good. The story, the acting, the sub story, the ending all kept me watching. Did maybe start just a little slow but was definitely worth it. The scary parts, the demon...all very well done. Do wish there were more like this in English.",1527120000,,326,4.5423728813559325
7759791,5,B01GFAK0JE,"Superb! Much more intelligent than The Exorcist.

There is solid research here: what the demon says about humans, and its precognition is accurate and scarier than pea soup vomit.

I HIGHLY recommend. I will happily watch it again.

I agree that the poster makes it look like cheap horror flick. The subtitles weren't late.",1526947200,2,323,4.944444444444445
7759792,5,B01GFAK0JE,This was really good. Watch it!,1524960000,,31,4.333333333333333
7759793,4,B01GFAK0JE,"Another great Korean flick...  however, this is fairly weak on the ""horror"" compared to many other Korean horrors I've seen.  Excellent job on the whole exorcism and whatnot, but overall I might lean this was more of a thriller than a horror...  Either way, two thumbs up...",1523232000,,274,4.787234042553192
7759794,4,B01GFAK0JE,"As with seemingly all Korean Horror, this film has a touch of levity/comedy before the main act that can make you wonder if you're watching a spoof, or simply that the writers are trying to make light of the issue(s), or are truly trying to be comedic. That can be a bit confusing at times, but if you've watched any Korean Horror already you know this.

Otherwise it's a superbly acted and displayed story that is original enough to hold interest. Some of the SFX are a little raw (the smoke coming from the thurible in the patient's room), and some are EXTREMELY unnecessarily drawn out (the closeup on the young priest's face at the end before the bridge dive), but overall they did not detract from the entire story.

I enjoyed this movie, and more than I expected to. I have not had very good experiences with Korean horror to date, so I almost skipped it. I'm glad I didn't.",1518393600,,880,4.459627329192546
7759795,5,B01GFAK0JE,"Good movie! I agree with the reviewer who said they should change the cover, they most certainly should. If you enjoy religious horror, you won't be disappointed. Worth the watch!",1517961600,,179,5.0
7759796,5,B01GFAK0JE,This movie was done really really well and much more scary than even the Emily Rose movie. Dong-won Kang does this in such a way that it is not cheesy. Very impressed I look forward to more horror type movies from him. Thank you!,1515888000,,229,4.2272727272727275
7759797,5,B01GFAK0JE,Enjoyed watch.  Wish there are The Priests 2.,1515888000,,45,4.625

8762829,5,B01GFAK0JE,"Exorcist movies are over done, a dime a dozen and usually cheesy.... and they're all kind of the same. But there's something new and original about this one that makes it stand alone. They intertwine some Asian culture with the Catholic Religion, like the assistants needing to be born the year of the Tiger in the Chinese Zodiac and there's also a really amazingly awesome Shaman ritual. The possession has all the regular signs we've all seen before, like speaking different languages, aggression, knowing things they shouldn't know..... but then there's some new stuff I've never seen in an exorcist movie before and it's a breath of fresh air in a stale repetitive genre. There is some CGI, but its done very well and used sparely, the demon is actually super creepy and scary. Definitely recommend this movie.... I know some people don't like movies with subtitles, but this movie if worth having to read them.",1535846400,,915,4.871794871794871
8762830,5,B01GFAK0JE,"..Or the subtitles or anything like that. This was a damn fine movie. It shows the fight against evil is NOT glamorous or an enviable position to be in. You will be hated and reviled for doing the right thing. No Hollywood type ending. Doing good is it's own reward. If you are not religious in any way this movie may go right over your head. For those who believe in God and the devil, it may make your personal struggles a little easier to understand and deal with.",1535760000,,467,4.258426966292135
8762831,5,B01GFAK0JE,"I think this movie was excellent. Great acting, great plot, great buildup with many unexpected twists and turns. Thank God for subtitles!",1534636800,,137,5.2727272727272725

8762833,5,B01GFAK0JE,"I have to give this 5 stars, it was very well done, the acting was good, the special effects weren't overexaggerated and looked real. It was a little slow at first getting to the exorcism and some things done I'd never heard of Catholic rites of exorcism doing (such as bringing in the pig, or the demon having to have a male host) but it's a movie and it's entertaining.",1529280000,,371,4.314285714285714
8762834,2,B01GFAK0JE,No voice over and no sub titles. It was impossible to watch. Shame. It looked good in the previews.,1529020800,,99,4.2631578947368425
