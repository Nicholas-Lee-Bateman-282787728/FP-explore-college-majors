7832977,5,6302981824,"David Gray has produced at least two great exercise videos that are fun to use and a great workout for anyone who likes dancing to music.  I can't find anything new, however.  Does anyone know anything about him personally, or if he has come out with any new dance videos?",1021248000,,272,4.42
7832978,5,6302981824,"This tape was a real disappointment in that IT IS EXACTLY the same exercise video as David Gray's FUNK ESSENTIALS - but with a different title and cover!  I love David Gray's exercise videos. They are clear, easy to follow, lots of fun, and a great workout. Needless to say I was very excited when I saw what I thought was going to be a new video.  I was disheartened to get it and realize it was one I already owned (but by a different name).  I will be careful in the future- this was advertised in a dishonest manner.  There should have been some warning that this is simply a new name and new cover for an old video.",993772800,3,620,4.141666666666667
