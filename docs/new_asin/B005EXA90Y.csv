8469271,2,B005EXA90Y,"Screenwriter Dwight Taylor improvised this John van Drutens play about two couples who are unhappily married. Irene Dunne plays a proprietor of a London antique shop (married to Nils Asther) falls in love with a married man (played by Clive Brook), a boring attorney. This story is one of the many controversial films made during pre-code Hollywood. In this illicit love, the viewers not only get to see Dunne smooching married Brook, but also adds another twist in the story, that is, Dunne knows that his wife (played by Lorraine MacLean) wouldnt to give him divorce.  The movie is pretty dull except for the fine performance of Irene Dunne.",1479600000,,643,4.89908256880734
