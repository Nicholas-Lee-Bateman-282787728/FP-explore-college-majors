2557580,3,B000FA57W6,"This episode immediately sets itself apart as giving it's characters more distinct personalities than the others I've seen. The director even had the good sense to cast Fairuza Balk, so anytime she's speaking your attention will be held. After the first 15 minutes though it starts directing viewer focus out in too many directions and not holding it there with any of them so it's easy to just stop caring about what's going to happen. The second half of this episode proved to be duller than any of the previous six I've seen. The fued between the two killers has very little explanation or resolution.",1178150400,,604,4.761904761904762
2557581,2,B000FA57W6,"This movie was alittle better then expected but not by much.  The movie definently had a good choice for a cast.  Each star of the cast did a good job, but the plot could have been alittle better.  The end was something I was not expecting.  I did make me wonder what would happen next.  Although it was alittle confusing.  But it was an okay movie, definently one to rent to see if you like it.",1173484800,,395,4.131578947368421
2557582,3,B000FA57W6,"According to this flick 1 out of every 2 people are serial killers.
Serial Killers who are by no means methodical,
and kill simply when the chance presents itself.
Serial Killers who don't take their victims to a secluded area,
and are in no way sexually driven.

This is the tale of two spontaneous killers preying on the same group of unfortunate travelers, whose bus broke down in the middle of Murderville, USA.  One is disguised as a trucker in shining armor, and the other as a hitch-hiker in desperate need of a ride. (Appropriatly named, ""Wheeler"" and ""Rider""). Both killers eventually set their sights on the last of the passengers, Ms. Faruza Balk.  What should have ensued was a wild game of cat(s) and mouse.  What happened instead can only be described as ... well a tame game of mouse and mouse trap.

To say the least,
this installment of ""Masters of Horror"" is flawed at best.
At worst it seems kind of rushed.
Now I'm not going to point out all the mistakes,
'cause it would take a while,
and quite honestly, it's better to make a game out of it.
See how many flaws you can catch before the credits.
Trust me you'll find a bunch.

You should definitely rent before buying.
Soley based on the fact that this is a love/hate sort of movie.
And you won't know whether or not you love or hate it 'til you see it.
Regardless of all its mistakes, it was a fun ride, so I didn't mind purchasing the DVD.
But would I recommend it?
- Only for someone looking for a fun movie.
- But definitely not for someone whose a stickler for details.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Don't take rides and Don't give 'em.",1173225600,9,1603,4.377104377104377
2557583,3,B000FA57W6,"This indeed did not belong in a Masters of Horrors series as it was more of a phsycological thriller to me, and not a good one at that. I bought it to watch it and because the completest in me couldn't go on without having every title of the series. To me it was the weakest of them all.",1167782400,,287,3.8813559322033897
2557584,4,B000FA57W6,"At first I was a bit disappointed to learn that Larry Cohen did not write his own episode of MOH; Cohen is a fantastic writer, and a tv veteran, so he could easily have come up with something wonderful. Then I read that David J. Schow was scripting from his own short story; interesting, but Schow's writing seems a bit more primal and more in line with a Tobe Hooper-like director. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong: the episode is a little gem, and definitely one of the best of the rather lukewarm series.

Michael Moriarty is hilarious, conjuring the spirit of Archie Bunker, as a whacked-out truck driver. I don't want to spoil anything for potential viewers, suffice to say that this is a suspenseful, and refreshingly literate little movie. It offers humor, horror, and suprises that keep it from being run of the mill tv fodder. Kudos to everyone involved. My only complaint is the ending: I know that it was meant to be a bizarre punchline, but for me it was just silly and pulled me right out of the story. What comes before that is alot of fun. Here's hoping Larry Cohen directs another movie, and soon. You can sample David J. Schow's writing in one of his many books.",1166745600,,1184,4.506976744186047
2557585,5,B000FA57W6,"Everybody's a movie critic, well, at least they try to be.  This episode won't be picture of the year, but, with that aside, this episode was very good.  Decent story with great special effects.  Buy this, it is better than all these Amazon pretend critics say it is.",1164499200,,267,4.520833333333333
2557586,1,B000FA57W6,"Well, I had it coming... After being told, after experiencing the disappointment of most titles from this pseudo terror series, I still went and bought this thing. Some other guys have already told the story, so, just know that there is nothing relevant, nor scary, nor original in this -so called- film. David Schow (I actually bought the DVD because of him -screenwriter of The Crow and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the beginning, and author of many, many great short stories) even repeats himself -lines from Bad Guy Hats, from THe Kill Riff, etc-. However, it is the uneventful, terribly chosen and misguided casting, and their soap-opera-like acting, as well as the dull and lazy, and way uninspired direction, that make this film so painfully bad, and boring, and predictable. Larry Cohen has never been an original or even adequate director (let's not say scary, I mean, see his filmography), but since Schow's name was attached to this... well.

Don't bother, watch the worst chapter of The Hitchhiker, watch The Hitcher again, watch Invader Zim, anything is better and scarier than this waste of time.",1161388800,4,1106,5.010869565217392
2557587,4,B000FA57W6,"I'm writing on simply the movie itself, not the dvd.  The movie short is about (without giving too much away)...well, let me start over...

The angle of this movie, is that there is usually a killer vs. victim relationship going on... well in this one, that is true... but its a dichotomous relationship!  There are two killers, and in the middle... The ever so creepy, yet incredibly hot Feruza Balk!

This movie is straight, no chaser!  It will take you through a twist of whose who, and leave you wondering who will walk out alive?  if at all.

I'm probably not doing the film justice, so lets see if I can entice you quickly: decapitations, violence, creative disposal of bodies, massive killing, and a neat use of a dead rattle snake.

I suggest giving it a try!",1154217600,11,767,4.547445255474453
2557598,5,B000FA57W6,"more than a gore movie, this episode of MOH is a combination of thrill, horror, suspense. very well done, one of my favourites of the 1rst season",1348790400,,145,4.407407407407407

Fairuza Balk plays a young woman caught between these two maniacs as they battle for murderous supremacy! PICK ME UP is one of the better MOH offerings, w/ a nice mix of terror and humour. There's also a ghoulish twist at the end! Director Larry Cohen (IT'S ALIVE 1-3, Q: THE WINGED SERPENT, GOD TOLD ME TO, etc.) does the best work he's done in years! Well worth adding to any horror collection...",1289606400,2,505,4.685393258426966
2557601,2,B000FA57W6,"A young woman (Fairuza Balk) stranded on a lone highway after the bus she was travelling in breaks down, becomes the centre of a tug of war between 2 obnoxious killers. One killer, played by Michael Moriarty named Wheeler, is a truck driver who kills any hitchhiker who is unfortunate enough to hitch a ride with him and the other, a slick Brad Pitt clone named Walker (Warren Kole), loves to murder anyone who is friendly enough and unfortunate enough to pick him up.

""Pick Me Up"", directed by Larry Cohen (""It's Alive"", ""God Told Me To"", ""Q - The Winged Serpent""), is in my opinion one of the least memorable episodes of the series. Despite a good cast; Michael Moriarty, Fairuza Balk and great location shots, it still manages to induce boredom. The pace is agonizingly slow. The film is hardly an hour but by the time it is done, it feels like you've committed 2+ hours watching it and you get nothing in return. Even Fairuza Balk, who has a face made for the genre, is unable to salvage this. It's not her fault since she didn't write the material and the overall execution must be blamed on the director. The story is routine but in the right hands, could have been a satisfying shocker, the characters are all ridiculous caricatures that you won't mind seeing cut up in to little pieces just so they'd shut up and the suspense... wait, there is none.

Many installments of the ""Masters of Horror"" series have provided little chills but have made up for it one way or another. For instance, the highly entertaining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deer-Woman/dp/B000F3UACK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deer Woman</a>&nbsp;had great performances (especially from Brian Benben), wit, imagination and some gruesome autopsy scenes. It was not scary in the least but the gore & mystical tale of vengeance kept it interesting right up to the climax.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sick-Girl/dp/B000F3UACU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sick Girl</a>&nbsp;had quirky but likable characters and a story so ridiculous it kept you involved not to mention the bug FX and mutation scenes and an always entertaining lesbian love scene.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Haeckel-s-Tale/dp/B000FS2W3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Haeckel's Tale</a>&nbsp;provided a generous amount of zombies, a bit of outlandish gore and soft-core porn scenes that was wrong on so many levels and Dario Argento's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jenifer/dp/B000FS2W3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jenifer</a>? Well let's just say there was an even balance of laughs and disgusting highlights all rolled up into one Argento filled hour. ""Pick Me Up"" has nothing new to offer. It has the typical MOH nudity and a generous amount of blood, but not to the degree that will have you cowering in disgust. What is left are annoying characters, a lame plot and a climax that will leave you speechless and not in a good way. The lead actors all do a fine job and it is a shame the film is not worthy of their talents. Cohen, Moriarty and Balk have all done better than this. Recommended for die-hard fans of Cohen, or the 2 actors mentioned. Others may want to skip this.",1257984000,,3297,5.565737051792829
2557602,3,B000FA57W6,"Not a terrible horror film.  It held my interest until the end, as I was interested in seeing how the girl escaped these two killers.  I was disappointed that this horror film took the easy way out and again the main character does not make it in the end.  Too cliche.  Horror films do this way too much.  Many times evil is defeated, only to pop up on the screen at the end of the movie, or we hear an evil laugh in the distance.  It's bullcrap.  Why couldn't the main character be [...] and kill the killers.  They build her up to be all tough and self reliant, only to fail in the end. lame.",1251936000,,594,4.060344827586207
2557603,1,B000FA57W6,"Boy, what a stinker.  This tale of multiple serial killers strains credulity well beyond the breaking point and has not one ounce of genuine creativity in it.  Director Larry Cohen (who has done some very good work in the past) and screenwriters Mick Garris and David J. Schow struggle mightily to give us quirky murderers who dispatch their victims to the accompaniment of snappy kiss-off lines; it's a pretty low bar to set, but it can still be entertaining if done well.  When it is done this poorly, it makes everyone involved look like a cretin who wants to laugh at murder but lacks a sense of humor.

I really don't understand why the success rate for this series is so low, especially with the involvement of so many ""masters.""",1247961600,,735,4.630769230769231

I may be a bit biased because this is a DJS story...but I like it alot.  I sweet little indapendant feature that has a strong casty ( Fairuza Balk was also a purchasing incentive) and a truely horrible tale to tell.
This film is not quite a stalker flick, not quite a slasher flick and not quite a ""we are alone in the woods"" type of flick...but some strange amalgamut of them all..that somehow works.
Not the best horror but a pretty good bang for your buck!",1228780800,,568,4.299065420560748
2557605,4,B000FA57W6,"The characterization of some oddball serial killers and terrific dialouge are the saving grace of this MOH episode.

As is typical of Cohen, this is a bit tongue and cheek with some good kill scenes, some genuine suspense and hilarious characters. As seems to be the problem with many of the MOH tales, one hour was not quite enough to really flesh out the plot, which really was good given the time restraints.

If you like other Larry Cohen films, you should enjoy this one as it really hits the spot from an entertainment perspective.",1228521600,2,537,4.6421052631578945
2557606,3,B000FA57W6,"I wouldn't exactly call Larry Cohen a master of horror.  Schlock horror to be sure, considering this is the guy who brought us It's Alive!, God Told Me To, and scripted Maniac Cop.  Then again, this installment of Masters of Horror, entitled Pick Me Up, doesn't aspire to be anything else but schlock horror, and in that respect alone, it works for what it is, and ends up being an entertaining episode.  Fairuza Balk stars as a tough girl caught between two serial killers in the middle of nowhere.  The killers are a deranged hitchiker (Warren Kole) and an even more unhinged truckdriver (Cohen regular Michael Moriarty), and soon enough the bloody games are on.  While pretty much everyone hams it up, and the episode ends up being somewhat more unintentionally funny than it probably should be, Pick Me Up is still a pretty enjoyable installment in the debut season of Masters of Horror.  The ending is undoubtedly the best part though, and is sure to leave any horror fan with a sense of humor with a grin on their face.  Also featuring Cohen regular and Maniac Cop damsal Laurene Landon.",1222387200,,1093,4.69109947643979
2557607,2,B000FA57W6,"Pick Me Up offers a great premise: What if a motorist who kills hitchhikers picks up a hitchhiker who kills motorists? Imagine the taut, suspenseful, claustrophobic film that would develop as these two psychopaths try to kill one another. I would love to see that movie! But that's not this movie. Instead, Pick Me Up is a slighter, kind of hammy horror movie, which is expected since Larry Cohen (of Q fame) is the helmer. I think that the movie wastes time with the broken-down bus scenario. Characters are introduced that we don't need to know. I would have preferred that the two killers encounter each other right away. I do not mind the addition of a third character in jeopardy (we need someone to root for) but Fairuza Balk, a good actress, is mostly wasted. The guy playing the hitcher is forgettable, although Michael Moriarty is quirky and funny as the truck driver. The twist is amusing, although nowadays having a twist seems like a cliche.",1191974400,,953,4.712574850299402

8119691,4,B000FA57W6,"Well, this one is a pretty surprising episode in the series to say the least. First, it had a lot of ingredients to get me into the thrill such as: 2 serial killers instead of one only (Michael Moriarty and Warren Khole.) and the tuff chick (Fairuza Balk, no less.)

But where the episode turns out to be pretty interesting and somewhat different is the fact that there was no paranormal or any occult phenomenon or mutant in this one. The killers aren't making ten days plan before hitting. They take the road, find victims and act. Because this is basically what killers do. In this one, one is a hitchhicker and the other one is an old truck driver. Misses originalty? When was the last time we had an original person or killer in a movie or on T.V? And with only 10 days to shoot an hour movie, legendary director Larry Cohen manages to outsmart similar works pretty easily such as: Vacancy or The Strangers. Not saying it puts them to shame, but it is surely better than many suspense scares i saw during that time. Maybe worth saying that along with the great cast and director, Pick Me Up was written by David Schow, a man perceived as the master of the Splatterpunk style that appeared in the early eighties to compete against softer horror stories. Pick Me Up isn't a splatterpunk fest, does it still exists today anyway? But sure has enough nudity and gore to be called a gruesome flick, with staying anchored to the roots of the cat and mouse type of scare and it does all that pretty well. Never disgusts the viewer in a way that will make him turn his head or close his eyes.

A really cool gem in the T.V Horror genre, a pretty fun one hour flick. And it stands amongst the best of MOH's season 1 along with Cigarette Burns, Jenifer, Heickel's Tale and Dance of the Dead in my opinion.
