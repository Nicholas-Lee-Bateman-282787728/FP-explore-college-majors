8726536,5,B012SX6T06,"We love Cat in the Hat! Its silly enough to keep my toddler entertained while learning at the same time. I like getting the series instead of the random episode DVDs, you get a lot more for your money. I would definitely buy this again. We have all 4 of the sets from volume 1. Kids learn about how plants and flowers grow, the colors of the rainbow, microorganisms, etc without getting too in depth (or boring). If you like the DVDs check out the Cat in the Hat learning library series of books too. Episodes in this set include:
Reindeer Games
Along Came a Spider
Teeny Weeny Adventure
I See Seeds
Surprise Surprise
A Howling Good Time
Secret Super Digger
Pucker Up and Blow
Sniff and Seek
Aye Aye!
Blue Feet are Neat
Reef Magic
Be Cool
Elephant Walk
Flutter by Butterfly
Pretty in Pink
