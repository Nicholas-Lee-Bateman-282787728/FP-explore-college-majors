1902525,4,B0000A59XN,"I bought this on the advice of my wife, who is American and has heard of Richard Simmons. (He is not well known here in the UK) and I am so glad I did...it is lively, energetic and most importantly FUN. All the Workout DVDs here are repetitive, monotonous and the people are not 'real'. At least Richard uses some people that have a bit of life and a bit of substance to them!

I have been doing this DVD each day for a week now, and whilst it has taken me this long to co-ordinate the moves, it IS working, and I have started losing again (7lbs) after a 2 month plateau....

The only niggle is, (and the reason it is 4 not 5 star) you don't have any real guidance as to whats coming...you feel as though you are bumbling along, but persevere, it will come to you and everything just 'clicks'! Oh..and if you have ceiling fans you can reach, make sure you don't stand underneath them whilst working out!! (Ouch!)

Maybe watch the DVD through before you workout to it, I fared much better the second time, than I did the first...and now a week later I am doing just as well as the folks in the DVD...

Good Luck with your weight loss program!!",1151280000,83,1142,4.200913242009133
1902526,2,B0000A59XN,"I get a workout but that's the only good thing.  During the first song, there's some out-of-place screaming that is just bone-chilling.  The kind of screaming you hear when your computer volume is on and that scary face shows up.  And what's with the fuzzy photography?  And then there is the traditional person who looks out of place in the workout.  This time it's the lady dressed up in red and yellow (think ketchup and mustard).  The camera loves her breasts and she makes these stupid faces.  I'm surprised she doesn't fall out of her shirt.",1142812800,23,547,4.635416666666667
1902527,5,B0000A59XN,"Being a Richard Simmons fan for the past 20 years, I was a little surprised that this video was only 30 minutes.  The workout did nothing for my upper body and there were a lot of steps that will take time to learn.  The routine is familiar, so if you are new to Richard, you will have some problems keeping up.  Of all of my videos, this is my least favorite.  STILL, Richard makes you smile and the exercise is painless and entertaining.  His first are the best, though!",1127174400,,472,4.258426966292135
1902528,1,B0000A59XN,"I bought this dvd because I do like 80's music as well as real people and Richard Simmons personality. I feel Richard put very little into this, he doesn't say much at all, and there are no extras and not many songs! I am sorry to say this Richard, but this was spastic and a waste of money.",1104883200,43,291,4.0344827586206895
1902529,1,B0000A59XN,"This workout was horrible, I did not like it at all. I rather do minna's emergency's workout. She pays much more attention to a correct posture, making the moves correctly. With Richard Simmons: '80s Blast-Off DVD I could have done this workout without his DVD, just take some 80's music turn it on and start shaking all over make some weird moves, and there you go! I have the sense Richard Simmons is only making these DVD's to insure his bankaccount is well taken care off, there was nothing extra on this DVD what so ever. Just 30 minutes of moving and shaking around, in were I should feel like 'A NUMBER ONE' afterwards. Well i did not feel a number one, I felt an idiot because I paid to much money for this DVD.. Advise: Do Not Buy.",1092614400,35,740,4.330935251798561
1902530,4,B0000A59XN,"This is a typical Richard Simmons workout program.  The dance moves are easy and well choreographed.  If you fully participate in the dance, you will be sweating at the end.  The only critism I have is that you probably will not catch on to the moves on the first viewing, as he gives no warning about what is coming next.  However, that being said, the second time around, all moves seem to come naturally and fall into place.",1086220800,29,427,4.435897435897436
1902531,4,B0000A59XN,"Pro: if you are just starting out i would recomend any of the richard simmons line for a couple of reasons. first of all he has real people in his videos! i personally don't want to see girls in the background that weigh 2.2 lbs and make everything seem so easy. in his videos their are people of all shapes and sizes, so in my mind if they can do it so can i. He also has high energy and the music is great. Con: there are no instuction on the moves before they happen, you will fumble around the first few times as you try and keep up, but you will end up getting it! and i expected a bit more because its a dvd, but there are no extras, just straight workout. if you are just starting out, this is a good one to get, just don't get too frustrated if you cant get the moves down right away.",1077408000,73,792,3.9254658385093166
1902532,4,B0000A59XN,"As in his other videos, he hardly cues any of the moves, so you'd have to decide if you're ok with just following along a few times before picking up all the moves.  This video is more vigorous then some of his others, I definitly worked up a sweat!  I thought it was alot of fun, there were times when I couldn't stop smiling and actually LOL when we do the ""fast runs"" in Maniac and when we ""honk"" in Freeway of Love.
If you can stand Richard Simmons, like 80s music and need a workout, this is the one for you!",1076976000,15,513,4.019607843137255
1902533,4,B0000A59XN,"I started using Richard Simmons videos years ago because I saw people like me, overweight, doing the moves.  It was motivating because I figured if they could do it (some bigger than me) then I should be able to as well.  I like this video.  The music is my era, but if you have never done much cardio, this isn't the place the start.  You definitely don't get much instruction, as was stated in another review, and the pace is much quicker than in some of his previous videos.  One thing I like about all the Blast Off videos I've seen is that you often feel more like you're dancing than doing aerobics, so it's much more fun, and anything that can make working out fun gets a definite nod from me.",1070928000,14,700,4.2727272727272725

1902580,5,B0000A59XN,I used to do the Sweating to the Oldies back in the late 80s early 90s with my daughter every morning who was 4 or 5 at the time and we have a blast...  I was doing a 25 minute workout to Shaun T but at my age it was really difficult... I just liked that it was 25 minutes so recently I saw this tape for 30 minutes and it fits into my schedule and I have to tell you it takes make me smile.  While the dance moves are not complicated I tend to step up my routine and run instead of walk so I can work up a sweat and to get more benefit out of this workout... but love it!  Who cannot laugh when someone is looking at you saying sparkle for me!,1412208000,2,644,3.6861313868613137

1902587,3,B0000A59XN,"I was generous and gave this 3 stars because I LOVE Richard Simmons workouts, but this DVD is dreadful!!  He goes WAY to fast and there is no guidance as to what is coming up, making the workout exhausting and irritating.  The 60s Blast Off is even worse!  I tried doing this for about a week and that's all I could stand.",1391299200,,322,4.161290322580645
1902588,5,B0000A59XN,I love Richard Simmons and I love the whole 80's decade so what is a better way to get in shape ! I will admit I hoped for more songs from the decade but the songs on the disc are fantastic.

1902613,5,B0000A59XN,"It is a very good LOW impact aerobics video that I can easily follow with a really injured back that does not hurt it, but is helping it to become stonger again, along with helping me to lose weight.  I haven't really lost any weight yet, but I have to remember, it's only been shy of a week.  GREAT VIDEO and Richard Simmons is so charismatic and loving, makes me feel good while working out!  You know he cares and that means a lot!",1388793600,3,434,4.142857142857143
1902614,1,B0000A59XN,"The videography is horrible.  It looks like someone's teenage nephew filmed this.  It's out of focus at times, and the camera movements are jerky.  I only made it five minutes before I shut it off.",1388016000,,197,4.571428571428571
1902615,3,B0000A59XN,Love the Music but find the instruction disjointed.  The transition between exercises is not smooth.  Not good for new users.  Must be familiar with the dvd before you can follow along.,1387584000,,185,4.903225806451613

We all know it it ain't fun it ain't getting done. So buy this DVD set and start dancing. I lost 25 pounds and still loosing. You can too so don't wait thinking I'll get it next time get it now and start loosing. You won't be sorry I know I'm not. Also try the
Richard Simmons Hope Project program They are all loads of fun.",1376265600,,419,4.0
1902619,5,B0000A59XN,"I chose this DVD mainly because it was Richard Simmons!  He's fun, energetic and seems to genuinley care about others physical and emotional well being.  I was looking for a DVD with good music and that would make me want to move! This is definately it!  I am significantly overweight, so was concerned about being able to keep up and master the steps.  It took a few times of doing it, but I'm getting there. It's a good workout for someone who is not in great shape! I highly recommend this DVD!",1374019200,,497,4.369565217391305

1902634,5,B0000A59XN,I like Richard Simmons even though it is an older video.  I still like and enjoy it.  You should try it.,1364774400,,104,3.9047619047619047

1902636,5,B0000A59XN,"First off, let me say that the people that are worried about the songs and the video production are entirely missing the point of this video.  This is an exercise video to help you loose weight, not entertain you.  If you want good production, just watch a Blu-Ray movie instead.  I ordered this video about a month ago and I can say I have already seen a difference in how my body feels and how I feel mentally.  I do it six times a week and for a 30 minute video you really sweat and it it's a lot of fun.  I don't care for all the songs and probably wouldn't spend my spare time listening to them, but they make it fun to exercise to. I have lost weight and I do feel great so I have already gotten back my 12 bucks(that was including shipping) and then some.  As far as the girl with the cleavage goes, who cares!  I mean you can turn regular TV and see about 25 examples of cleavage in about 5 minutes!  I thought she was cute and had a lot of energy. This video is great for those that only have limited time to work out each day. The title is most definitely true to it's word.  You will blast those pounds off and quickly if you are controlling your portions and not eating a bunch of junk!  I recommend this one and don't listen to all the haters!",1361059200,,1256,4.048582995951417
1902637,2,B0000A59XN,I like the songs and the moves on this DVD. however; half of the DVD is blurry so you cannot see what they are doing.,1360713600,,117,3.72
1902638,2,B0000A59XN,"I own several of Richards DVDsand am a fan of the SuperSweating Party (it is continuous from song to song while the older workouts stop between songs). I thought that I'd like to add another more recently produced DVD to my inventory hoping for the same continuous flow.however.....I think that this DVD may just be a sign that the era of the Richard Simmons workouts have come to an end.  The quality of this was very poor compared to others, and there was some blurred portions where possibly the intent was to give it a modern feel..but it is actually pretty awful.",1359504000,,568,4.568627450980392

1902640,4,B0000A59XN,This video was fun and a good work out... as long as I could endure my husband heckling me and the video from the background.,1355875200,2,125,4.04
1902641,5,B0000A59XN,"A solid cardio workout packed into 30 minutes. This was just what I needed to kickoff years of relative inactivity. I thought this would be something to alternate with my elliptical workout, but soon discovered that this is more strenuous. So glad I ordered this DVD. After one month of working out 5 to 6 times a week, I am getting stronger, have significantly more endurance, and have lost 8 pounds.",1353369600,6,401,4.661971830985915
1902642,3,B0000A59XN,"I am a huge Richard Simmons fan because I love the way he motivates and his exercise videos are fun even for those of us who don't like exercising! What I particularly love about Richard is the dancing to great music! Most videos are not like this so I was very disappointed when I put this DVD on.  I am a child of the 80s so I was expecting great 80s music, but the song choice is not inspiring at all. The dance moves are difficult (for those of us like me who don't know how to dance!) and typically, Richard doesn't explain the moves or tell you when they are changing. You have to watch the video a number of times before you can really get them down. Also, the backdrop is a typical exercise room like you would find in hundreds of other exercise videos out there. There isn't the great backdrops of his more famous Sweatin' videos. Really, the backdrop wouldn't matter if the dancing and music were fabulous, but they aren't. Personally, I don't think this workout is worth it, unless you are a real diehard fan!  It's not one I use often. Three stars.",1352851200,2,1060,4.321608040201005
1902673,3,B0000A59XN,Great short 30 minute workout. I love the music and the people are high energy. Once again like the 60's video it is a poor quality DVD not the usual high quality as the sweatin to the oldies it looks like an amateur  filmed it. I also didn't like some of the shots of the female anatomy on this video. A couple of the  closups during one of the songs  were a little bit gross in my opinion. I did not feel that the video was worth the money I spent on it.,1351296000,2,456,3.881720430107527
1902674,1,B0000A59XN,"this is not worth a nickel. theres no instruction you just jump in and try to keep up with all the different moves . the music sucks, what you can hear of it. the worst ever, i should have gone with Gilad. also the ""dancers"" are the losers from table 9 in wedding singer.

1902680,4,B0000A59XN,"I really enjoy this video. It is faster paced than the Sweating to the oldies and Disco Sweat videos. It gets right down to business with little muss or fuss. I agree with the other reviews that it doesn't have much instruction but I just watched it once and worked through it once and I got the moves down. This is a great video if you are busy and just want to get a great workout and your 30min a day of exercise. Richard Simmons other videos are an hour to an hour and 15mins and when you have a very busy schedule, it's hard to fit that in. My only word of caution is that because it's shorter it's much faster paced so I don't recommend it for very overweight people and/or very unfit.",1272585600,2,691,4.125925925925926

1902704,1,B0000A59XN,"Don't waste your money on this one.  I purchased it thinking this was going to be like the disco dvd (fun with music I knew) however, it was short, the steps were horrible, I had never heard of any of the songs (I grew up in the 80's so I expected Top 40 songs)  I would skip this purchase if I were you.  Mine is actually going into the rummage sale pile.",1241049600,7,356,3.9166666666666665
1902705,4,B0000A59XN,"I read the other reviews before buying this, so I couldn't wait to compare the negative remarks with what I saw. The 2 most noted negative remarks are completely false in my opinion. Richard is still his typical happy self, and the camera does not pay any more attention to the busty woman in red and yellow than it does anyone else. I think it's just more noticeable with her because she's the only one with cleavage, but had I not read it, I wouldn't have ever noticed this as standing out. The workout does its job - it gets you moving and burning fat and it works. It's definitely challenging if you haven't exercised in a while and have a lot of pounds to lose, but the 30 minutes is not too long and flies by. True that there is no instruction and he jumps right into it, so it does take a few times to get the hang of it, but that is appreciated once you know what you're doing so it's not a big deal. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the music could have been way better outside of ""Maniac."" Other than that there is ""Upside Down"" and ""Freeway of Love"" plus 2 completely unrecognizable 80s-sounding songs. But overall, I love it.",1238630400,6,1143,4.223744292237443
1902706,3,B0000A59XN,I was satisfied with my purchase because it's only about 30 minutes long and that's about all the time I have to spare.  This is the 3rd Richard Simmons cd that I own.  I have fun with it.,1238198400,2,188,3.9210526315789473
1902707,5,B0000A59XN,"I like the music, the moves, and it makes the 30 min exercise go fast.

1902708,1,B0000A59XN,"While I love Richard Simmons, after I bought the DVD I was completely discouraged, it just jumps right into the workout, he gives you no instruction & you feel completely lost. I have purchased his other workouts in the past & they were great but this one was not worth the money I paid for it.",1234569600,4,294,4.267857142857143
1902709,5,B0000A59XN,"I certainly would not expect that I would be saying that an exercise DVD was fun.  However, Richard Simmons pours on the high energy and you just can't help but smile when using this DVD.

I only have 30 minutes a day to exercise.  This DVD fit the bill very well.  You have a warm-up song, three songs of actual aerobics (medium, intense, medium) and then a cool-down song.  I appreciate the fact that I have no trouble doing these exercises even though I have arthritis in both knees.  It takes a bit of practice to learn the dance moves but as Richard exhorts you: ""Just keep trying!""",1234224000,14,587,4.388888888888889
1902710,1,B0000A59XN,"I love Richard Simmons and have been using his tapes and DVD's since he began his career however this one goes in the ""donate"" pile.  It looks and feels as if it were just thrown together.  He gives little or no instruction (unusual) and the routines have little of his trademark creativity.  I was exhausted at the end of the workout but not in a good way.",1234224000,2,357,4.298507462686567
1902711,3,B0000A59XN,I was expecting more... I got less.. I ended selling it. I think it was boring and not as other videos of Richard.,1231632000,,114,4.0
1902712,5,B0000A59XN,"This a great workout if you have limited time.  It is fun, easy to learn, and you can get your exercise in for a time investment of only 1/2 hour!",1226793600,,146,3.8666666666666667
1902733,5,B0000A59XN,I loved this DVD and you get a good fast paced workout. I have lost 30 pounds and I think anyone who loves some good music and some dancing to go along with a workout this is the DVD for you. It last about 30 min and thats all you really need to lose some extra pounds or just to stay in shape. You will have a good time doing this DVD. And the moves are easy to learn you will be dancing and sweating and losing weight all at the same time.,1224720000,4,441,3.752688172043011
1902734,5,B0000A59XN,"Richard Simmons is still the best.  I am overweight and type 2 diabetic.  1/2 hour a day exercise is mandatory and this is just right and not too strenuous.

I like the music but the 60's video is better.  Also try Tammilee's videos,  need some variety.",1220745600,2,253,4.413043478260869

1902736,1,B0000A59XN,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Richard Simmons, and have a collection of many of his workouts.  I recently purchased this particular one thinking it would give me the same great results of the Sweating to Oldies series. I was very wrong.  The workout is very uncoordinated, and the focus is not the greatest. I'd rather go with the disco sweat workout.",1195948800,9,338,4.616666666666666
1902737,4,B0000A59XN,"This is a typical Richard Simmons exercise routine but this tape has a couple of problems.  The camera work is done so that sometimes you can't see the next step or move needed until Richard and crew are well into it.  This is because the camera is aimed elsewhere.  Also where other Simmons tapes have small breaks between songs, this is edited so that when one is finished you immediately go into the next.

It does provide a nice 30 minutes exercise session but you have to be on your toes to follow it all.",1187827200,5,510,4.336842105263158
1902738,4,B0000A59XN,It's just what I expect from Richard Simmons.  It's a lot of fun and keepa you interested.  Plus you really do get your heart rate up and get a work out.  It does take a few times to get the  moves down.  I love doing this workout.,1185840000,3,231,3.8297872340425534
1902739,5,B0000A59XN,"I have to agree with other reviews that say that it's a little hard to get at first, but it only took me a few days to master Richard's moves.  He reuses moves, too, so if you've done any of his other workouts, you'll recognize stuff.  Awesome workout.  Will definately get you sweatin' by the 3rd song.",1176163200,,303,4.280701754385965
1902740,5,B0000A59XN,"I have so much fun with this workout! I watched it through one time to get familiar with the moves (which I do with all my workout videos) and they were pretty easy to follow the first time I actually followed along. I chose this particular workout because it's only 30 minutes and I wasn't sure how intense it would be. I have asthma and anything that's too high impact sets it off. This was great, not too strenuous, but it got my heart rate up. It's only 30 minutes long, but it's so much fun, it only feels like 10 minutes!",1174089600,5,527,4.176470588235294
1902741,2,B0000A59XN,"I have many of the Sweating tapes and looked forward to another exciting one.  This was only a half hour long and had only two familiar songs.  I am used to seeing all song titles on the jacket which helps me decide. On the positive side, the exercise routines were good.  My issue is the songs keep me going and there was nothing on this tape to keep my interest",1170547200,2,363,4.1571428571428575
1902742,4,B0000A59XN,"First, let me say I have not worked out in quite some time - years - so this was a little tough for me.

I love it though. I rented it and liked it so much I am buying it.

I do agree with ither reviewers who say he just jumps in and there is no explanation of the next moves. But follow along and you'll do fine. It gets better the more times you do the workout.",1167782400,10,363,3.641025641025641

I will say this, any movement is good when trying to become or stay healthy so in that aspect, this is perfect. However, there is absolutely no instruction in this DVD. So basically, if you like 80's pop music as I do, it is nice for listening to and dancing around. No need to follow the moves as you won't be able to, at least not at first. If you keep watching I am sure you could catch on, but this is just not what I was looking for. I could have gotten a 80's mix CD for cheaper and danced around to that.",1449014400,,615,4.049180327868853
