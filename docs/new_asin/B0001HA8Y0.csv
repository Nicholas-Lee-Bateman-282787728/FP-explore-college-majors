8012538,4,B0001HA8Y0,"The chemistry between Bipasha Basu (actress) and John Abraham (actor)is ridiculous. Some of the songs are romantic, catchy and quite steamy. The plot thickens about 20 minutes into the movie. Overall, its a good watch but not a classic or anything.",1381795200,,248,5.073170731707317
8012539,5,B0001HA8Y0,"This movie is so good, but it's not like your typical Bollywood films.  I believe it's still considered the sexiest Bollywood film ever produced, but it may have been surpassed by a newer film I'm not aware of.  The plot was good and the chemistry was awesome, I loved it.",1361491200,,272,4.42
8012540,1,B0001HA8Y0,"John Abraham made his debut in this unfortunately titled film (which means ""Body"" in Hindi), alongside Bipasha Basu, who was also fairly new to the industry at the time. The movie marked the beginning of their off-screen relationship (they've been together ever since) and it made them big stars because of its provocative content. But that's the only good thing that can be said about it--it's sexy, in a late-night Cinemax sort of way. Jism is based on the 1981 Hollywood film Body Heat, and one scene is lifted right out of another American movie, 9 1/2 weeks (1986). Abraham plays Kabir, a hard-drinking lawyer, and Basu plays Sonia, a femme fatale with a rich husband. In the midst of their sexually intense affair, Sonia convinces Kabir to murder her husband so they can be together and enjoy the inheritance. The acting is nothing short of awful, but the co-stars, who have since developed into competent actors, make the most of the only asset they have at this early stage of their careers--sex appeal--which served as the foundation for their later success. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1302,5.58080808080808
8012541,2,B0001HA8Y0,"The unfortunately titled ""Jism"" is a bollywood remake of Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 masterpiece, ""Body Heat."" That alone makes it worth watching, but the movie runs into a few problems along the way. In the first place it runs way too long for such a small-scale noir thriller. What Kasdan was able to do in a little under two hours, Jism draws out to seemingly Ben-Hur lengths. This is a problem, because the story is so compact that it can be told rather speedily, leaving the director little choice but to throw a lot of filler at us. There are a couple of musical numbers, for instance, which burn a lot of screen time, but leave the viewer wondering what the heck all the singing is about. True, this is Bollywood, so musical numbers are allowed. But the songs aren't even good ones, so the exercise is mostly wasted.

In addition, the film is over-acted in that soap opera kind of way that leaves you wincing just about every time the leads deliver their lines. On the other hand, it is obvious that neither star was hired for thier acting abilities so its a little easy to forgive. But the whole thing just smacks of cheesiness. Both Basu and Abraham are so super-sexy that they put the rest of us mere mortals to shame, but that's a problem since that makes it easy for the viewer to dismiss them. Their beachside sex scenes at high tide are just goofy. Watching them roll around in the sand, it's easy to imagine big Indian housewives eating bon-bons and finger banging themselves beneath thier saris. The movie is just that shallow.

Which is too bad, because the original story is really a good one, with charged characters and a nail-biting plot. But Bipasha Basu is no Kathleen Turner, and the only way she could ever carry a film is with her double dees. John Abraham's only a little bit better, which is why he spends most of the movie with his shirt off.

The only other thing worth noting about this film is the sweat. In fact, there's so much persperation that it almost becomes another character. The intent is to make us think we are watching something sultry and steamy, a plate of forbidden sex served up from the Indian subcontinent. But the sweat has so much sheen to it that one begins to think it's really just axle grease, rubbed on just before filming commenced. Either way, it really doesn't matter. This is just porn with the good parts cut out.",1128556800,2,2371,4.522144522144522
8012542,5,B0001HA8Y0,The movie is a must watch.  John Abraham's debut movie and with this he proved that models can also act.  Bipasha basu his co-star in the movie and his girl friend in real life has equally performed well.  The movie is shot in small town of India called Pondycherry.,1083542400,3,266,4.387755102040816
