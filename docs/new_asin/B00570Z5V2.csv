8460113,3,B00570Z5V2,I love Jack LaLanne! I wanted to buy this video because I thought it would be chock full of face exercises. I am getting older and was noticing some facial sagging. There was not as many exercises as I thought there should be. The video quality was adequate. I was a bit disappointed. Anyway... I am doing the exercises that were on the video and do notice some soreness the next day so that is good.,1459382400,,400,4.276315789473684
8460114,1,B00570Z5V2,"There are more face exercises on his TV show than on this DVD. Nothing new here (not even helpful), except he introduced his family and did a little singing. Glad a portion of the money went towards the arthritis foundation.",1456790400,2,224,4.625
8460115,5,B00570Z5V2,I got this dvd for a friend who teaches active aging exercise classes. He loved viewing how LaLanne did these facial exercises and uses many of the exercises in all of his daily classes.,1437696000,3,186,4.5
8460116,5,B00570Z5V2,"I love Jack!!!  I do his facial exercises on this video, and he has 30 short face exercise videos on the internet for free that I do 3 days a week.  Fact is, the only way you are going to tone up is by exercise, water and eating healthy.  Face exercising does work :) Save your money on the fancy, expensive face and neck creams.  Exercise your face and neck and buy a nice and healthy organic face and neck cream with proven ingredients without the harsh, toxic unnecessary additives.",1370390400,9,485,4.355555555555555
