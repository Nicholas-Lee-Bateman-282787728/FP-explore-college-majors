7794168,5,0970141106,"For the money, I thought this video was an excellent deal.  Most travel videos are very short and more like an advertisement by travel agents.  This one was long enough that we broke it into a few sessions.  It showed everything we were wondering about: what the towns looked like, what it was like to use the public transportation and taxis--my wife was really nervous before.  It also gave great information about what it would be like if we decided to move there, including problems with getting a phone and such, and we could even see what the banks and telephone company looked like inside and out.  We enjoyed learning about the history of each town and didn't need to buy a separate book.  Overall, we're really happy with this video and have watched it over and over and lent it to friends, too.",1013299200,4,803,4.541666666666667

It showed people smiling, close ups and bad views of Lake Chapala which was repeated.  My video had blank secions in it when all I got was music.  I like the mexican music but felt it was repeated over and over for the whole time.  I never lost the audio, just the video. I would not recommend spending money for it, unless it were 10 bucks.",987379200,2,514,4.214285714285714

Along with that is the practical side of small town life.  This is a video to check out.",964569600,,253,4.382978723404255
7794171,5,0970141106,"When I finally saw this video I was thrilled. Not only is the scenary beautifully depicted, but MexicoMama has prepared a video that is truly useful for anyone considering visiting or moving to the area!  From the  imagery of each town's sqaure to the practical tips and shots of how to go  through airport customs (red light/green light)and get a taxi to take to  the area .... even the details of how to set up your electric and phone,  etc.! This video is jam-packed with exactly the information needed.  And  it's managed to capture the ""personality"" of the area, as well!  Great Job!",964396800,2,588,4.640776699029126
