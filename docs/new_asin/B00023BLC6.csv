8021035,4,B00023BLC6,"I ordered this because I was teaching a high school anatomy class and wanted something more mature than Bill Nye. This wasn't as bad as Bill Nye (I like him, but he's not appropriate for High School level), but it was still very hokey. The Students weren't too impressed, though liked it because it was 'movie day'. as for an anatomy class, this was not up to par, *maybe* as a regular 9th grade biology class, but that would be pushing it.",1375142400,,440,4.378048780487805
8021036,5,B00023BLC6,"I teach medical assisting and unfortunately, my school has no instructional videos.  I decided to buy this video as a supplement to my lectures on Anatomy & Physiology classes.  The students can follow easily and the video is very detailed, and it covers more than one body system.

I recommend this for parents who want their kids to have an edge on anatomy and physiology.  I also recommend this to other medical instructors for their classes.",1220659200,2,445,4.815789473684211
