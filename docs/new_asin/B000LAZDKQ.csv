8160623,4,B000LAZDKQ,"If you're fan of Steven Chow's silly, slapstick style, you'll enjoy this. If not, this may be a bit dated. He hadn't quite come into the form he showed as a filmmaker in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, but a lot of the raw groundwork is here. Kept me entertained, but may not be everyone's taste.",1496620800,,299,4.2631578947368425

8160625,5,B000LAZDKQ,"In each scene one has great acting, great stunts, and gags straight from the 3 Stooges. It is impossible to predict where the movie will go next. And then, underlying all of that is some biting satire of martial arts movie cliches. And then under that an even more savage critique of the commercialization of Japanese culture, of pop culture (the fetishing of name brands like Armani). All this is going on at the same time in the same scene that the viewer can hardly keep up with all the mayhem. But, yes, also: very very funny. And again, when they are not mugging for the camera, the acting is convincing even to make the viewer think that now we are returning to a standard martial arts ""the underdog wins"" movie. And then: Surprise Again! I do not give that many unabashed 5 stars, but this movie deserves it!",1495152000,,815,4.476510067114094

8160628,5,B000LAZDKQ,"If you liked the non-reality comedy style of Scott Pilgrim (not the indie-vibe or CG) then you have to see this movie.
And them watch Shaolin Soccer, Ping Pong, and Kung Fu Hustle.

Stephen Chow rules.",1285286400,2,201,4.583333333333333
8160629,5,B000LAZDKQ,"Stephen Chow is my favourite. I like him so much as his movies always funny and nothing that he do doesn't make me laugh. This is one that i like most. If u just want something funny, this is highly recomend by me..
In this movie he play a coward delivery man fallen in love with a judo student. As he try to woo her, a series of incident only make him look like a fool and coward -expect a really funny suprise and some touching moment here and there. The secene where he try to get Jacky Chueng ticket concert and when he fail to send the message to Lily are really funny. Taking advantage, Ng Man Tat fool Stephen Chow to be his kung fu student- Watch him fighthing in Garfield masked. The ring fighthing scene is extremely hillarious as he fight a powerfull opponent using physychology trick to win the game. Also the MC reviews on the game~based on a love book.",987724800,,866,4.254545454545455
