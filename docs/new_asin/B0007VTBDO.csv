Teenagers may look like adults but they are still children at heart and need some form of direction if they are not going to become problmes when they are adults. This collection of films, shot a while ago, but still relevent, show exactly what parents can do to help their teens get up on their feet and live a productive rather than a lazy or dangerous life. They also explain to teens exactly why it's not a good idea to be a waste product. It's a good thing.",1148428800,,620,4.132231404958677
8159703,5,B0007VTBDO,"It's interesting when you think about how boring most of us perceive the 1950s to be to think that counter culuture and rebellion (really the seeds of the 1960s) all started in the post WWII era when there was suddenly not much for teenagers to do in the suburbs.

I liked how these films gave me a sense of how terrified people were that this generation was going to become a nightmare (borne out by the Flower Child thing when these kids got to college) and how they did everything they could to scare the heck out of the kids to get them to shape up.

Of course teh Wild Ones of this DVD are not that wild by todays standards (they drink beer, make out and listen to rock music) but it's cool to see this put into context.",1146441600,,725,4.171428571428572
