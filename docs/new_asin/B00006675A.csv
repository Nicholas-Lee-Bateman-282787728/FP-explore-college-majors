7961853,5,B00006675A,"For many people looking for something other than HK action movies, this one's for you.  Especially if you enjoy movies like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"", you will enjoy ""and i hate you so"".

Zhang hosts a top rated radio program that offers advice regarding love affairs. He starts a love-war relationship with Wu, a columnist, when she hears him gossiping on her love life! Outraged, Wu begins to take revenge by writing against his program. This all-out fight caught the imagination of the public. Then the two protagonists find themselves attracted to each other but how are they going to tell each other?

The film's highlight is the music used.  Sets up beautiful ambience that I love.

The quality of the DVD is very well done.  Dialogue audio is nicely done.  Video is nice as well.  The music really captures the beauty of this film as well.

All in all an awesome romantic film of 2000. The other being ""Needing You"". Highly recommended!",1220400000,2,967,4.74251497005988
7961854,3,B00006675A,"I love Pride and Prejudice, and even though the plot is different from the book, the movie made me think of the conflict Jane Austen created for her main characters.

The actors (Aaron Kwok, and Kelly Chen) are very engaging and keep your interest throughout the journey their characters take -- from hating each other to falling in love (not giving away any secrets).  As in life, it's all about the journey, and they take us along a roller coaster ride.

This is a great date movie that will leave you humming and singing.  The Chinese accent is so melodious!",1179619200,,561,4.58

7961856,5,B00006675A,"if you like the movie you've got mail and chinese movies, then you'll love this one. It's an absolutely wonderful movie with a great plot and great acting.

The movie is about a journalist who comes across an old vinyl record that she had given a former lover. When she confronts the sales woman, she says that it's already been sold and that the man will be back to pick it up. The woman tries to convince the man to let her have it, but he's unsympathetic and doesnt care. Later, we find out that he's a radio dj and during his show, he starts making fun of her and, in a way, starts an all out war between the two. If you've seen you've got mail, then you'll understand the general idea of how it ends.

I would highly recommend this movie. It is very funny and entertaining. If you don't believe me, send questions to lfurey@iupui.edu.",1164067200,3,839,4.30379746835443

Kelly Chan is Luna Ng, a popular columnist who makes an enemy of DJ Cheung Yung (Aaron Kwok) when she attempts to stop him from buying a used vinyl record. Cheung Yung is a lover of old vinyl and plays them on his popular radio show, where he plays old tunes and gives sometimes retarded romantic advice. Luna wanted that record because she gave it to her first love, and now in shcok to see it in the hand of the DJ. The two begin to fight, she in her column and he on his radio show.
the director did a fine job of filming this movie. despite of the script, Aaron Kwok and Kelly Chan's performances are acceptable and it could be their best pairing perfomance ever.
but check out Anna Magdalena (aka Kissing you) first",1028851200,3,742,4.307142857142857
