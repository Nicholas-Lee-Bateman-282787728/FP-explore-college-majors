97508,4,0790729709,"The Bodyguard is the only Whitney movie that I  enjoy best.  Her movie debut just sparked some public hysteria that was both captivating and sensual because of the good credits coming from the movie soundtrack, which  I believe gave the movie the good ratings.",926899200,,260,4.863636363636363
97509,5,0790729709,"I've seen a lot of movies in my lifetime, and I am usually really picky when it comes to giving a movie great credits. But I will really give this movie a rate of 5 stars - both for story, filming, actors, best soundtrack  and best costumes. This is the best movie I've ever seen - and I still mean  this 6 years after I saw it for the first time.",926294400,6,347,3.8732394366197185

I am 13 and that is one of my most favoritest movie I have  ever seen and I hope that anyone who hasn't seen this movie should rent it  and watch it because u will agree this is a great movie. It is for people  who like action, romance, and who is in for a good laugh. I give this movie  5 STARS!!",919555200,,458,3.89247311827957

97709,1,0790729709,"Review of The Bodyguard
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Theres really only legitimate reason to watch The Bodyguard: if you're a Whitney Houston fan. And I mean total, complete, number-one fan. Anyone else in the audience will see from the first scene that Whitney is a terrible excuse for an actress, and the plot is as thin as the romance. And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.

Whitneys blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. Its boring, theres no chemistry, and theres no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.

So, even though Kevin Costners a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs.",1497744000,,850,4.653333333333333

97721,5,0790729709,"I really love this movie. It has great acting, good plot line,  nice scenery, etc, . I saw this in the theatres and when it came out on tape I bought it. There one big blooper. If Frank is supposed top notch why does he allow his mail pile up in front of his house on the ground? Still a keeper.",1495411200,,295,3.8360655737704916

97724,5,0790729709,"What can I say about this DVD, but amazing! Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are so good in this movie and having it in Blu-ray, just makes it better to view. There is a review that complains about the how loud the music is over the voices. I think almost every TV show and movie I've ever seen, has louder music or violence than the voices. It doesn't matter if it's HD, Blu-ray, DVD..whatever. I wish it would all be evened out, but I disagree that, this is a problem with this one Blu-ray. Just my opinion. I enjoyed this movie in Blu-ray.",1493164800,2,543,4.281553398058253

97728,3,0790729709,"It's fun, but very straight. We liked Whitney Houston's role, her acting and her singing of course. Her white bf can only express his anger by randomly assaulting a totally innocent Latino kitchen worker with absolutely no legal, social, or economic consequences, but apparently he is sexy and a good man. We found the plot a bit disjointed, but also suspenseful and engaging. There are some late 80s/early 90s winter lake cabin sweater scenes with that special Folgers glow.",1492128000,,475,5.025316455696203

97765,2,0790729709,"This rating is only for the blu ray quality, and not for the movie itself. The movie itself is very good, but this transfer is just horrible. The video quality is decent, but it's definitely not great by most blu ray standards. The real problem, however, is the awful sound quality. You can either hear what the actors are saying and be made deaf by the music and action, or you can enjoy the music and action while hoping you can read lips. To make matters worse, the movie is really good at switching between moments of dialogue and moments of action, so there is never enough time to quickly change the volume between the two. I don't think I have ever had a movie that had this drastic a difference in sound. I would strongly recommend sticking with the DVD if you already have it because this is definitely not an upgrade.",1490745600,,827,4.411764705882353

98171,3,0790729709,"Singer/actress is stalked. Handlers hire bodyguard to protect her.

This movie blurred the lines so many times between reality and movie script that you mostly thought it was a Whitney Houston video. Several times throughout the movie they even full screen played her videos. It was obviously a promotional vehicle for her.

One thing I remember was it was at this time you saw the real Whitney Houston. She went from the removed/guarded all American songstress to this trashy, ghetto talking person. She rose to fame as they did a good job of hiding who she really was . . . like Cosby, Oprah, etc. But then at the top of her popularity they couldn't hide her anymore. So she did Barbara Walters interviews where she just made a joke of herself. I remember seeing Walters face like ""Is this an act or what is going on here"". She went from classy persona to just vulgarity. Houston couldn't even put together a complete sentence. She was being crude, talking ghetto slang. It was so not what she had been presented to be. And here came this movie where she did the same.thing. Just a huge turn off. While initially I was surprised that Costner would star in such a film we all soon learned he would do anything. Ironically this marked the down turn in his career.

The movie was just unrealistic. It tried to make people into something that they simply are not and it came across that way. It tried to make what you saw on the screen acceptable and it wasn't.",1463356800,,1459,4.518939393939394

98262,5,0790729709,"I had this DVD some time ago but some where in my many moves, it was lost or misplaced.  With the passing of Whitney Houston, I remembered I hadn't seen the disc in some time.  I decided to repurchase it again.  I definitely enjoyed it and was so happy to have a copy once again.  She did well in the film but her singing is definitely her forte.  Her voice was beautiful and she will surely be missed.

Thank you,

98309,5,0790729709,"Come on. Made in the 90s. Strong story. FIne talent. Kevin and Whitney (if I can't have him, I'd vote for Whitney to take my place and Kevin is hiding all of his feelings on screen and off screen--they should have been married. At that time America's favourite people. Great music. Sexy.

It could have been sexier if the stuck up Americans that we have to share with the romantic and beautiful side. The best about this Special Edition are the personal interviews between the two and how Kevin waited for Whitney to do this movie. He did not want anyone else.

 It was interesting that back inn the 70s that Diana Ross and Steve McQueen were originally chosen to act in this film. The thing is, McQueen did not want to do it and I dropped  watching McQueen's movies after he was so adamant in NOT playing opposite Diana Ross and the project was cancelled.

 Even Anthony Perkins was man enough to play in a poorly directed version opposite Diana Ross. They even allowed him to be obsessed over Ross and ""psycho"" in this version (Mahogany--of course).

 It only needed a better director to pull this off. ""Psycho"" alone made Perkins an A lister and more popular than Mc Queen. He even Outlived McQueen and produced a remake of"" Psycho"" in colour. Tell me that Perkins doesn't have the ""You-know whats"" or not?

I would have liked to watch that version and how they would have played it out. McQueen was a pussy for not acting in this performance. It said a LOT about him in that time. It was the 70s for Pete's sake. So much more little tid bits about the films covered in this special edition.

 I wish that they did explore them doing you know what's. Now it's the 90s and America could not allow more. Europe would have been a block buster if they should a little bit more. I could not believe that the pussy cat Warner Brothers who LOVE showing more violence, but not erotic sex? Come on peeps. I would have shown them truly sweating and Kevin howling at the moon (but he probably did this during private practising at his secret hideaway home). He didn't want Michelle Pfifer or  Barbra Streisand to play the role as Warner Brothers desired, Kevin said (in many interviews) he wanted Whitney and we know why and in many ways why. Say yes to breaking that colour barrier. I would not have seen this if they placed any one else BUT Houston.

Whitney's gorgeous and I don't care if she had her troubles. She gave us her talent and she should be rewarded for that. It would have  been Terrible if ""Brandi or some other Gen Y singer played opposite Costner.

These two made it work and the interviews and behind the scenes were very nicely added if you want more.

Great to have in your DVD library.",1451779200,,2699,4.444219066937119

98596,4,0790729709,"Good acting, good music and entertaining storyline provides some decent relaxing escapism for those that enjoy a nice romantic mystery.  There is a nice connection between the show-no-emotion ex-secret service agent Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) and spoiled diva Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) and the movie flows well as the two are slowly drawn together while he is acting as her bodyguard.  It has a wonderful soundtrack and in a rarity two of the songs, ""I Have Nothing"" and ""Run To You"" were nominated for the Academy Award for best Original Song.  This script kicked around Hollywood a long time before being made.  Originally it was to have been done in the '70s with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.  Then with Ross and Ryan O'Neal, but that ended when the two who had been dating, broke up.  It was a nice easy paced film when it was finally made and Costner and Houston did a good job.  It is a nice way to pass the time, well worth a watch.",1426982400,6,948,4.57396449704142

I didn't find her cold, unresponsive or some of the other things with which she has been labeled by some of the professional reviewers. Kevin Costner, who is also listed as a Co-Producer, did a good deadpan job in the kind of role that Clint Eastwood, Michael Douglas and others have made a standard. The film offers romance, danger, mystery, show biz antics and, of course, singing. What more could you want.

Every word like spun honey, and then in song...there's no comparison.  But Kevin Costner... I never did particularly like him, but I definitely did not notice how wooden he is in this performance. There is actually no believable reason presented in this move as to why she would like this plank of wood. The film totally lacks credibility - he has zero personality, his house is as blank as he is... Who would actually like this guy? And the scenes between them...so awkward...maybe that's partly Whitney's fault but wow. WOW. It could have been really great if the two leads could act.

It was short on character development and long on false dilemmas to create the story's tension.  Only thing worth it was the chemistry between Tony and Frank, and Frank's line about not discussing this anymore after their show of fists, knives and under kicks. Whitney voice remains that of a supreme goddess, but the everything else was missing.",1413849600,,467,5.118421052631579

I've been waiting for someone to give a review saying it's worthwhile to upgrade to Blu-ray. In my opinion it is. The Blu-ray doesn't make the DVD into a modern crystal clear digital experience, but, it makes a film we like a lot watchable again.

Sure you may think ""Blair Witch Project"" might be up there in the running but then you will realise that nothing could ever be as dismal as having to endure this. ( I refuse to say ""watch""!)
Whitney Houston imagining she can sing, ....between bouts of obviously being so off her face on drugs as to bounce off the scenery, along with Kevin Costner, (aka the world's MOST boring man) imagining he can act.

Sure you can doze off during his screen time and not miss anything of significance, BUT when Houston comes out in what looks like a silver lam gay space helmet, then plants both those feet, throws her shoulders back and warbles that ""ANDDDAH AHHHHH-EEEEEY-EH-AH-EH-AH will alwAAAAAZZZ LUV YOOO-OO-OUO-OU-OOOO!!!....."" I sit there pondering whether a DVD remote could actually do serious enough damage to your ears to make this torture end?
Specially if rammed into the side of your head with enough force?
What if you smashed it up against the coffee table a few times to ensure plenty of sharp projections?

Can anyone explain why she feels it necessary to make each single note into at least five?

It's rare that I come across a movie without a single redeeming feature, but this one is it folks!

She finds out then Cosner is on the job. Things get really wild and this is filled with a lot of action, naturally there is the music.  Whitney Houston portrays the famous singer. What Costner has to go thru to protect her is unbelievable, then her manager who is a major jerk and almost gets her killed. Very big surprise who the person is who hired an assassin to kill her.

99471,5,0790729709,"There are many fascinating and highly entertaining things about this film, but the one that burned itself indelibly into my mind was the incredible difference between the song ""I Will Always Love You"" as sung by Tex Ritter or someone like him on the jukebox in some dive where Costner and Houston are having a drink and the absolutely mind-blowing, electrifying explosion of Houston's version of it at the end. I couldn't believe it was the same song. Her tragic death was an incalculable loss to the music world, so we are very fortunate to have this film to remember her by. She and Costner (whose acting I don't usually appreciate that much) were magic together and transformed what might otherwise have been a rather mediocre film into a classic mystery/romance with a deeply bitter-sweet ending. Male, female, black, white, gay, straight -- if you're not in love with Houston by the time this film ends, your heart is made of stone.",1379203200,,937,4.790123456790123

99497,4,0790729709,"I had been wanting to see this movie for quite some time and finally had a bit of time to do just that, so I settled back to enjoy what had been a very hyped movie but I found it did not live up to the hype.  The stilted romance between the two leading characters left something to be desired, no pun intended.  What spoiled part of the ending of the film for me was that I was able to pick out the stalker almost as soon as he appeared in the film and from there the suspense was broken.  If you like thrillers or mystery stories and are accustomed to picking up on who the bad guy is, you should have no trouble picking up on the stalker in this film.  I won't tell though, for the sake of those who aren't accustomed to this genre of film and who may not recognize the telltale signs of a villain when they are written all over the screen.  It's an enjoyable film, but not one worthy of an Oscar, and apparently the Academy Awards agreed with that evaluation.  Still, it's worth watching and I got my money's worth.",1377216000,,1018,4.116161616161616

I love the performances throughout the movie most. I have watched this movie so many times I practically know it word for word. If you are a real music lover, this movie is addictive. The storyline is believable as you watch a beautiful relationship unfold.

Although the main character is successful and has everything a woman could want, there are some things money simply cannot buy. She learns to allow her new Bodygurad the opportunity to protect not only with her life but her heart as well.

99742,5,0790729709,"Strange sentence I know, but I really do enjoy this movie, even though it's a little corny. This is Whitney Houston in her first movie role where she's a singer who, you guess it, needs a bodyguard. There have been attacks on her life/creepy circumstances that keep happening to put her and her family in harm. Enter Kevin Costner ex-Secret Service to add a little fire and action. She overacts a little bit, but not large enough to be off putting. And let's face it, Kevin Costner is just awesome. A little cheesy, but worth the buy. For nothing else, to just stare at Kevin Costner in action or just to hear the ethereal voice that belonged to Miss Houston.",1362355200,,659,4.5

99864,2,0790729709,"The 90's was all about melodrama, especially in the early years.  Almost every big budget movie was formatted like a made for television Lifetime soap complete with slinky scores consisting of horns luring us into the theaters.  The fact that this was originally intended to be made in the 70's starring Diana Ross and Steve McQueen is a real interesting fact because the 70's was all about grit and it would have spurned a very different movie (also since those two 70's stars had more actorly talent than the stars of this 90's hit).  I almost wish I could see THAT version, since this one was so...well, meh.

Like I mentioned in my title, this is entertaining, but it isn't enthralling or really all that memorable.  It feels very much like a made for TV film, right down to the cringe worthy dialog and the horrible acting (sorry, but Whitney was atrocious here).

The film centers on an arrogant diva named Rachel Marron who is living the high life as a pop star and looking forward to winning an Oscar.  Unbeknownst to her, she has been receiving creepy letters from some psycho talking about her death and someone broke into her house and so she is receiving a new bodyguard who she isn't even sure she needs.  That bodyguard is Frank, the man with only one facial feature and no real personality.  Things get more complicated when Frank and Rachel get intimate and Rachel's jealous sister stars to bare her teeth and then someone tries to get dirty and actually kill Rachel and then she wins the Oscar and, well, she closes the movie by singing `I Will Always Love You' in a strange moment that doesn't entirely make sense.

Whitney's acting is scary bad, and Costner mopes his way through another performance.  The bad guys are easily spotted (so predictable) and some of the scenes are so bizarrely overdramatized in a way that isn't necessary.  Still, it was fun, I guess, and the music is killer (although the segments that show Rachel's music videos are laugh out loud hilarious).  It's funny to me that the star song of this film was `I Will Always Love You', which was a cover of the Dolly Parton hit from the 80's (`Best Little Whorehouse').  Like, that was a dumb move, especially since `I Have Nothing' is arguably a better song and yet suffered by being a shadowy feature and never made a focal point.  `I Have Nothing' is even a better song than the Oscar winning `A Whole New World' and could have won (probably not, considering how beloved `Aladdin' was and still is) but it really had no shot thanks to `I Will Always Love You' hogging all the attention.

Bah.

Anyways, this is a guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty about not really liking it all that much.  I understand the fans, but this is kind of lame and makes for a time waster that is only advisable on a day when you really want to waste time.",1360108800,2,2832,4.530451866404715

100062,4,0790729709,"""The Bodyguard"" starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston was my bargain-rack movie for last night. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I chose it because I've enjoyed Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves) and I've liked Whitney Houston's music, although I had no idea she was a movie actress as well. Go figure. Well, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The acting seemed weak as well as the plot and I just never could get into the story to any depth. As such, it became a ho-hum late night movie and will easily be forgotten a few nights later. I enjoyed Houston's singing, and it was especially poignant in the light of all the news of her recent death.

In the movie, Kostner played a body guard employed to protect Houston from a deranged stalker. Kostner had previous experience as a Secret Service Agent during the time of the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt. and he tightened security around her immensely, even  though she was constantly protesting. However, protecting a popular super-star when she is up for an Academy Award and appears in large crowds of fans is an almost super-human task. Well, he managed and the story had to do with how he managed. It's rather interesting in places. Oh yes, and of course, Kostner managed to fall in love with Houston along the way, which provided a little side story.  The movie is well put together. All in all, I'd say it's a weak movie, but not a bad movie. It's a bit of a yawner and I was expecting more..

The steam coming up from the walk at Whitneys mansion and statue lined drive, to jog and run in that steamy foresty town. The voice and the energy she emits, it is so viable so alive, It is extremely hard for me to think she used, too much flowing energy coming from her being. Her confidence and her poise. The family moments at the cabin, cooking, playing chess, holding each other, boating on a placid glass of water. Taking a hit for living in the moment, a moment filled with desire to really live your job. To help another, to be that kind and good. To be quiet and stoic without letting anybody know your insides that are filled with such beauty. Kevin's character has some of this.",1341705600,,1096,4.377450980392157

Whitney Houston's Music is Incredible to say the least, and her acting in this movie is one of her Best Performances. She was always a Big Fan of mine as soon as she was recognized for her unforgettable music. I remember how young she was when I first heard her sing, I was Amazed at her voice, and said ""She's Going Places-Big-time!"" Sure enough, she climbed to fame in no time. After her  passing, I watched this movie once again, listening to that Beautiful Voice. Whitney Houston sadly left this world, but her music will live on forever, including her song at the end of this movie. ""I Will Always Love You."" And the world will always love the music she left behind. Together, Kevin and Whitney made this movie highly entertaining, enjoyable, and thrilling. The characters helped to make the movie alive, along with the young boy who played her son. What was there not to like? There was plenty of action from beginning to end, never a dull moment and the only thing I was sorry about is that I didn't want it to end.

Kinda sad to watch knowing that Ms Whitney is no longer with us.  But makes you appreciate her first real acting effort all the more.  If the movie, A Star Is Born can be considered a classic for Barbara Streisand, then this should be considered in the same light for Whitney Houston; especially since it was her first effort.",1335744000,,501,4.533333333333333

I totally love this movie.  I have never seen it until this purchase. I will be watching this one again!!!

Stars Kevin Costner & Whitney Houston

This is ""A sexy romance. Intense and Intimate""

Whitney plays a music/movie star at her peak. One fan wants to kill her. That is where Costner comes in as a security expert who never lets his guard down. She has always been in control of her glamerous life. Each expects to be in charge. What they don't expect is to fall in love.

A must see for any Houston or Costner or old fashion romantic flick!",1335484800,,691,5.411214953271028

The movie lasted two hours an five minutes.

The video quality was disappointing.  Half the time it looked like a DVD.  Other times it looked high-def, but not real good high-def.  I rate it from 8.0 to 9.0 on a 10.0 scale.

100211,4,0790729709,"It's hard to believe that Whitney Houston was only in her late 20's when this movie was made. In many ways, art imitated life. She was young, vibrant, talented, and yet somewhat innocent of the things going on around her. Her manager wanted to keep her in the public eye, regardless of whether it was good press or bad.
The movie's portrayal of the paparazzi was certainly tame, especially when comparing them to what they've become today. They're constantly looking for a moment when their prey is weak, or vulnerable. We're all human, and as such, we all make mistakes or poor choices at one time or another in our lives. But they (the paparazzi)literally place their prey under a microscope for all the world to see.  In that sense, it's amazing we don't see more of them (actors and pop stars) become alcoholics, drug addicts, or commit suicide.
Some people say it's the cost of being a celebrity.  I believe the reason is that the world is full of ""wannabes"" who at first want to emulate their idols. But when their idol is caught in a weak moment, they want them to pay for their betrayal. And this love/hate relationship is fed, in large part, by the media, just like Whitney Houston.  Even after death, Whitney is still fodder for the media, whether she was abused as a child, a victim of domestic violence, or whether her death was suicide, drowning, or a drug induced heart attack. Regardless of which it is, the tragic news is that Whitney Houston is dead, and the world has lost a wonderful singer and actress.  Fortunately for most of us, Whitney Houston will be remembered by the songs she sang and the characters she played, and her tragic life will disappear in the fog of our memories.

I find it embarrassing to turn it on again having watched it for the first time a couple weeks ago and will throw out the DVD. The movie had really bad production values and seemed like a TV movie. All the acting is below par except for Kevin Costner, the script is LUDICROUS and makes light of the sister character's death, which defies belief. Whitney Houston's costumes are bizarre and not of that time or any time, something the director cooked up for no discernible reason except to objectivize her. There's nothing realistic about the actress' side of life, they tried to make the bodyguard activities realistic. You'd think they would have put more into the details of her life, but they made it super cheesey, gave her unbelievable, super naive employees, and convenient but unconvincing relatives. She doesn't seem that committed to her career, has no problems or issues to deal with other than safety, and it's hard to believe she'd be up for any award whatsoever, let alone a best acting award. The relationship between Houston and Costner is unpleasant, boring, and they have no chemistry.

The director and writer deserve the blame for this movie and watching them on the DVD extra features they don't come off very well. Based on this movie they should stop making them.

Whitney Houston could have performed far better had she directed by the right director. She's OK in a couple of scenes where she gets to show her desire to be with Kevin Costner. He doesn't seem to like her even when he does. Dopey.",1330646400,4,1613,4.716312056737588

Hollywood thinks that because you are an recording artist or an athlete, that you somehow are and actor. To me an actor is someone that causes you to forget you are watching an actor or a movie and you get caught up in the plot. If you got caught up in this acting you must watch a lot of cartoons. Along with Waterworld, this has to be one of Kevin's flops.

100426,4,0790729709,"The Bodyguard was a work of brilliance. Whitney Houston's performance in the movie was phenomenal, there was not a moment in the film where she wasn't at her best, I feel that she made a huge impact in her movie debut. There's really not much else that I can say about this film other than it was fantastic. When I heard the news of Whitney's
death that Saturday evening, I was stunned and saddened beyond belief as was everyone else who heard it.
I can only say that we lost one of the greatest singers of our lifetime and I doubt that we will see another talented performer like her again. For all her flaws and imperfections, she was still a beautiful person who will never be forgotten and her influence will play a role in encouraging other female singers to follow in her footsteps. Out of all of her great songs that I've heard over the years, ""One Moment In Time"" is the track that I will remember her for. She sang her heart out on that single with such heartfelt emotion that I wind up with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes everytime I hear it. May God welcome her into His heavenly kingdom and give her eternal peace, and may He comfort Whitney's family(particularly her daughter Bobbi Christine)in their time of unimaginable grief. As for her detractors who recently posted some of the most vile, hateful reviews about her on
amazon.com, hang your heads in shame and may God forgive you for what you've said. Fly to the angels Miss Houston,

That this caring was real and carried the movie to greatness, completing with Whitney's ""I Will Always Love You"" has taken on a unique and much deeper meaning now. I saw this movie when it was released 20 years ago (Whitney was only 28) and to me it was 5 stars. Last evening I watched it again, now in the broader context of my life and Whitney and Kevin's lives and the world we live in. It is sad that someone so alive was harmed and diminished and cut short in living her life by drugs and alcohol and the pressures that go with stardom, and we already have too many lessons like this.  I want to encourage you though (if you have not already) to experience first Kevin's tribute and then watch them together in the movie (all the better if for yet another time). Thank you Whitney for the extraordinarily gift you have given us in your life and career and left with us.

100431,4,0790729709,"2012 showed to be a year of celebration, and joy for Whitney Houston. But instead of celebrating 2 massive anniversaries for Whitney, including the 25th anniversary of her becoming the first songstress to have a album debut at #1 on Billboard and the 20th anniversary of The Bodyguard, and her work in the upcoming remake of Sparkle, we are dealing and reeling with the horrific and deviating loss of her life. Her songs and voice have always been some of the most intimate and soulful sonnets I have ever heard during the most trying to times. The Bodyguard is no exception with her first starring movie role with Kevin Costner. The film has been a instant classic for her fans and family. Hard to believe a role that was originally made for Diana Ross and cancelled in the 70's, became Whitney's acting opus in 1992, and still is just as strong as her voice. Now with the movie coming to Blu-Ray, we still celebrate this movie masterpiece for in Whitney's loving memory, and the joy her songs have brought us during the hardest of times.

The Bodyguard remains a classic and Whitney's chemistry with Kevin Costner is classic. The story honestly focuses on Rachel Marron, a star-celebrated actress and celebrity whom is stalked and is a target for murder. The chemistry that is there as a diva whom is known for her music and spirit the world over, deals with celebrating her life and a dash of tempermental ego, but finds love in the most strangest of ways with falling in love with the bodyguard hired to protect her Frank, played by Kevin. The chemistry in music and movies is definitively strong here in each and every turn from not just Whitney alone with her songs like I Have Nothing, the beautiful Run To You and of course the definitive I Will Always Love You, but also from others like Joe Cocker with Trust In Me to name a few. The chemistry and love in the film is absolutely amazing, and tugs at the deepest of heartstrings, in heart, soul and especially in spirit. The extras here also show including the definitive video for I Will Always Love You, where Whitney is sitting down, while pregnant with her baby Bobbi Kristina, just singing her heart out. The movie is just as bold today, as it was when it originally came out 20 years ago.

Overall, if you are new to Whitney Houston's music and movies, because of the sadness of having to say goodbye to her in death, we will always have a moment to celebrate her life and how she touched us in heart, soul and especially in spirits all over the world. The Bodyguard is a everlasting masterpiece from start to finish, and still shows why she was so talented from every angle in life. I absolutely recommend The Bodyguard for your movie library.

100433,3,0790729709,"On March 30, 1981, just 69 days into the presidency of Ronald Reagan, deranged Texas native John Hinkley Jr. attempted to assassinate the President over some bizarre obsession with Jodi Foster. Written in the 1970s originally intended for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross, the 90s 'The Bodyguard' uses this real-life incident as a plot-angle in this romantic suspense thriller that has an absolutely superb concept, yet comes short on total execution. The beautiful and tragic Whitney Houston plays herself basically here as music superstar Rachel Marron with the misfortune a perverted and quite ruthless stalker who seems hell-bent on killing her. Enter Frank Farmer (Costner), a former U.S. Secret Service agent, also considered 'the best', in Hollywood's classic cliche, is talked into being her protector. You see, Farmer was Reagan's bodyguard in 81', yet the one day he's not on duty is when the assassination attempt takes place. This haunts him to this very day. Rachel's clearly attracted to him the moment she lays eyes on him, and shows it by being a b! ch (don't worry gals, we get it) about his expertise in the art of protection interfering in her lifestyle. Heavy romance develops between the two, then there's some twists and turns in the plot and sh! hits the fan.

The one thing I do admire most about this film is the interracial love story is told without any reason to rationalize it for stupid reasons. Ethnicity isn't brought up, just two adults falling for eachother under the circumstances. And I also think that adds to the romantic tension between the two in a pleasant way. This is quite rare in Hollywood. Unfortunately though, the movie starts to gradually collapse about 2/3's of the way through. It gets insubstantial and even too slow at some points. The ending is semi-cool, yet, again, predictable - can pretty much be seen a mile away. But don't forget to look out for Robert Wuhl playing himself in a hilarious cameo.

Kevin Costner was perfect for this production and carried it off, as one of his better performances.  Of course, reality would not be so dramatic, but by the time the climax occurs, we are rooting for the good guy, and can't really turn back.  You might say, ""The Bodyguard"" story is really a Western in urban clothing.  Anyway, Whitney is well cast, and does a good job to remain natural and not attempt to overact.

100538,2,0790729709,"There are some parts of this movie that don't check for me.

One major issue is that the screen writer clearly has an understanding for how race plays out in film, yet still deliberately creates a movie that is racially insensitive.  Typically, media is viewed seriously for subtle racist messages, and unfortunately, this movie fails although appearing to be just the opposite.

Costner is presented as the hero for which the movie cannot do without.  He has a whole cast of sidekicks to help him to complete the task including the black limo driver that he recruits by informing him that if he doesn't become his side kick he will be killed because the ""cocky black soffer"" always dies by being in attentive.  The driver is a racial stereotype of a young lazy black man that has to be directed by a white superior.  The writer clearly understands that these racist roles are created for blacks but chooses to recreate bad roles for African Americans.  I do not know why.

  The depiction of black women in this movie is also extremely poor.  Whitney Houstan is not just spoiled; she is sexually irresponsible.  She is a stereotype of a successful African American female.  In one screen she almost has sex with the man plotting to kill her because she is angry at her boyfriend Costner, and wants to make him jealous.  Her character is immature.  Her sister is so sexually dysfunctional that she attempts also to sleep with Costner even though she knows that she would be sleeping with her own sister's lover.  I have an issue with this.  Not only does it reproduce patterns of male domination (females cannot be trusted) it also depicts black females as being sexually immoral. Like Houstan, her camera sister is extremely immature and needs the guidance of a white male played by Costner.

  The character of Rachel leaves much to be desired as far as a woman is concerned.  She is inconsiderate and abuses the people that work for her.  She also sexually harasses Costner and than tantrums on her own employee when he stops sleeping with her.  We are supposed to view that in line with her Leo character type, but her character is really just immature.  It doesn't make sense either since a singer as successful as the one she is playing would have to have a lot of discipline. The portrayal was just unfortunate.

  Costner's character is the usual white male come to fix problems all the problems of irrational (black) people.  That Costner must in fact fix the mess made by these two sisters is reaffirmed when Rachel's sister ends up being the one behind the murder plot.  It is really just pitifully prejudice. Blacks cannot have legitimate threats against them without them really being about killing each other. Rachel's sister is jealous, murderous, and caddy.  The actress cast is one of the most beautiful minority women but she is in the role of a criminal that would kill her own sister over petty jealousy.  The story is really ridiculous, and sad to point out, but it is a racist movie.

  I like Costner, but his character also needs tuning.  He is emotionally constipated to the point of being abusive. He beats up some man just for giving him lip.  He also jilts Houstan after sleeping with her, and this is supposed to some how prove that he is better at his job.  It just places him in the position of being in control rather than his female partner. That seems to be the main function of the scenes inclusion; a white male is always in control no matter how subordinate his position realistically would be.

The interracial love story would be interesting if the couple did not break up at the end of the film for no appealing reason. Again, when viewed for a general pattern most of these interracial movies end the same way; the couple is delegitimized. The Bodygaurd is no exception. The problems with this film could have been corrected easily, by simply making Houstan more mature, removing the jilting scene as it doesn't make sense, and not breaking the couple apart at the end of film--the major change would also be not making another black person really behind the murder plot.",1257552000,6,4112,4.691340782122905
100539,5,0790729709,"If you are looking for a bit of romance and drama, but just on the light side, then The Bodyguard doesn't disappoint. Costner and Houston have great onscreen chemistry. It worked well being that she is a rock star and her life is probably close to most of what we see...hopefully, without the dangerous drama. The storyline has its weak spots but watching Costner and Houston play the game of love/hate/love again makes it worth the time. Of course, Houston's dynamic voice adds to the entire enjoyment of the movie. Couldn't help notice how nice it was to not hear either of them or anyone in the movie mention ""race""...just two people who fell in love.

100540,4,0790729709,"If one can gather from the success of this film, don't always listen to the critics reviews--they can be wrong too.  For instance, the esteemed critics, Siskel and Ebert once dismissed a film called ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" as just fluff but history proved that the film would endure and in fact has had several DVD releases including one in Blu-ray.  I'm not saying that this film is an artistic triumph like Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" or Eastwood's latest films like ""The Changeling"" or ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", but as a pulp film, it's a success.  My acting coach at the time in San Francisco called it ""enjoyable trash"" and I agree with her. If you don't expect a lot, you'll get a lot.  I really like that this film in the pre-Obama era, played down the inter-racial angle and more the conflict between celebrity and private life.  Like Obama has stated there are more important issues to deal with than just the racial aspect--and this film proved it.  Houston was never more alluring and Costner is pitch perfect as the Zen like ex-Secret Service man who is reluctant to continue his assignment of protecting a pop star he has fallen in love with--""never get involved with the person you're protecting"".

100543,5,0790729709,"Whitney Houston became a certified boxoffice attraction with ""The Bodyguard"", a film about a pop diva being stalked by some psycho and who ultimately needs protection. Enter Kevin Costner. The plot is pretty simple: the two meet, do not like each other at all, and ultimately realize they are falling in love. The movie is well known for it's excellent soundtrack, that has gone on to be the biggest selling movie CD of all-time, even surpassing the 1977 album ""Saturday Night Fever"". What really made the film and the album is Whitney Houston's beautiful version of the Dolly Parton masterpiece ""I Will Always Love You"", that held on to the #1 position for 14 weeks in 1992-1993.
 ""The Bodyguard"" was originally suppose to star Diana Ross in the 1970's, and Steve McQueen was rumoured to be her co-star, but the project fell through. In the late 1980's Kevin Costner discovered the project and wanted Whitney Houston in the film. The movie also became a huge boxoffice hit.
 For the first time ""The Bodyguard"" is now on DVD in widescreen, after originally been available only in full screen. There is a nice music video and a featurette that accompanies the set.",1247356800,,1163,4.81
100544,5,0790729709,"This action film (with its stunning soundtrack) reaffirms a cherished tradition for nobility under fire. Some of the great warriors throughout history were bodyguards for women. Overtures, codes of conduct, epic stories of chivalry and unrelenting heroism, were written to honor those who took a sword or bullet for the women, under their protective wing. Rules of conduct prevailed in antiquity, even for passionate men, who found themselves in service to and falling in love with women of noble birth.

To hold dear the memory of service and requited love to a wealthy woman: this would be the premise of Bodyguard, the motion picture. Accepting the consequences of shielding a celebrity from her attackers is the duty assigned our hero. He is the one who strikes the match to passion between client and guardian; she may light up the sky with her fierce temperment, but he presides over the calmness, that measures out discretionary love, subdued passion, and quiet intimacy between a woman and a man.

The lyrical beauty of the soundtrack permeates the relationship between our two main characters (played by Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston); this, in turn, allows pure romanticism to prevail as an undercurrent, and permits the bold eye contact between lovers to secure the bonds of stoic passion. This merge of powerful voice and orchestration with the heightened tension of a certain attack on our heroine drives the crescendo upward into the major climax, at the awards' show. The grateful client honors her bodyguard with her words (and in song cherishes his devoted love to her). Chivalry remains paramount in this powerful film.",1245110400,,1641,5.119402985074627

Kevin was wonderful and he takes his bodyguard job seriously and tries not to get too personal and stay professional. The casting was right on, and the music perfectly fits the story.

But I don't, so I was forced to watch Kevin Costner as a former Secret Service agent trying to protect a superstar singer/actress (Whitney Houston). There's a lot wrong with this movie, and it gets sillier as it goes along. Let's look at a few of the problems: Costner and Houston have no chemistry together; first-time actress Houston being cast as an Oscar-nominated actress (whose acting we never get to see); a mystery I had solved in the first ten minutes; ""tough guy"" Costner only getting to beat up two out-of-shape guys who present no challenge; and a completely ludicrous climax that takes place at the Academy Awards, where the stars are shown arriving at night (!), with a killer who's smart enough to rig a gun inside a video camera but not smart enough to include a silencer!

100567,4,0790729709,"Stars fade, in time. But, at the summit of her talents and her popularity, Whitney Houston was simply untouchable, a singing phenom and, lord, was she lovely. Being so photogenic, it was a natural that she dip her toe into cinema. Whitney made her film acting debut in 1992's THE BODYGUARD, starring opposite Kevin Costner, who himself at the time was riding on a film career high, coming off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-with-Wolves-Extended-Cut-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00008PBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances with Wolves - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JFK-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0000CDL93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JFK - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

Costner plays Frank Farmer, an ex-Secret Service agent who now hires out as a private bodyguard. Frank's vocation requires him to live a solitary, almost austere life. He doesn't stay too long at any one assignment for fear of forming attachments to the people he safeguards. Considered the best, Farmer is tapped to protect music and film superstar Rachel Marron, who is being relentlessly stalked. Farmer reluctantly takes on the gig and immediately clashes with the spirited and temperamental Rachel, who rails at the restrictions Farmer places on her lifestyle. And, because the long-proven cinematic formula dictates that the intensity of the leads' initial mutual dislike is adversely proportioned to how heated the romance becomes, well, the sparks fly brightly between the stoic bodyguard and the tempestuous diva.

THE BODYGUARD, in 1992, was a box office moneymaker, undoubtedly helped by the spectacular soundtrack, but also because, in its own right, it's a decent thriller and an effective and bittersweet romantic story. The action sets are nice, my favorite being the ""We won't talk about this again"" kitchen discourse, although that was more of a one-way conversation from Frank. The hook is undeniably the prickly interaction between the two leads. I would think that a bodyguard, by necessity and by definition, would need to blend into the background. As such, Costner's bodyguard tends to be understated and very controlled. But every now and then, the actor's low key charisma does get a chance to leak out, as Farmer cracks a half-smile or three or makes the occasional straight-faced one-liner. And by having his character this impassive and guarded, Costner allows his female lead to shine. And Whitney's Rachel Marron certainly has that large personality.

Casting Whitney Houston was a stroke of genius and luck. In that time and place, who better to play the most popular pop star than the real deal herself? I thought that Whitney was a natural on screen, although critics shaved points off because, supposedly, she was only playing herself. But do you think a non-singer could've pulled off the musical sequences with as much conviction and credibility? Whenever she sang, Whitney Houston was in her element, and I totally bought into it and, consequentially, everything else that came with the role. And, lest you think she's a one trick pony, she would show even more of her acting chops in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-to-Exhale/dp/B00000ILEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting to Exhale</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Preacher-s-Wife/dp/B000065V3J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Preacher's Wife</a>.

There's this thing which Rachel's jerk of a manager tells Frank as he dresses him down: ""I mean, look, she's so hot right now. This is her time. If she doesn't get out there, she's dead... If she doesn't sing, she's dead, anyway."" This, coming from a tool, nevertheless is a stark commentary on the ephemeral quality of stardom. THE BODYGUARD has lost a bit of its luster down the years as Whitney's star waned. Not because she suddenly sucked or anything, but her troubled personal life did get in the way of her performing and producing records (thanks a bunch, Bobby Brown!).

And, since misery loves company, Kevin Costner, after a string of film successes, would soon churn out A PERFECT WORLD, THE WAR, and the career-crippling WATERWORLD (which I actually thought was a cool flick).

The key song was originally going to be ""What Becomes Of A Broken Heart?"" And who knows what Whitney would've done with that torch song (but it would've been great). As it is, we instead end up getting the fabulous remake of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" I eventually got sick of this song, because of the constant airplay, but I remember how well it framed the closing moments of the film.

Another thing I dug: Costner's white, Houston's black. This wasn't even a factor in the movie. How cool is that?",1224892800,22,4917,5.783149171270718

100596,3,0790729709,"Fans of Whitney Houston will certainly enjoy this movie.  It captures her at close to her career peak and features a few of her better known hits (including her version of ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""I Have Nothing"").  Neither she nor co-star Kevin Costner fare as well on the acting end.  Since Houston later proved to be effective in WAITING TO EXHALE, I would guess that she either suffered from first film jitters or that she needed better direction--or both.  The script is generally weak and the dialogue is stilted, and there are moments when the line readings are so off, you almost wonder if the stars' first language is something other than English.  And if the mark of a good director is the ability to coax a credible performance from a child actor, then Mick Jackson's abilities could be questioned on that basis alone: the young actor playing Whitney's son is stiff and awkward.  But given his ""mom's"" stilted line readings, it could be viewed as some kind of genetic condition.

Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon above jokes that Whitney's role as a show biz diva must have be a real ""stretch"" is clever.  But it's just possible that Whitney might have fared better with a role that was less close to her own life experience.  Getting out of high show biz mode seemed to help her performance a few years later in EXHALE, although it could also be the case that she was simply a bit more comfortable onscreen by that time.

The supporting cast is also just OK, for the most part, although many have done better work elsewhere, so you do know they can act.  Ralph Waite, as the Costner's dad doesn't have a lot to do, but he brings a certain gravitas to his small role.  Probably the only performer who gets to shine in a real emotive moment is Michele Lamar Richards who plays Whitney's sister and manager.  Even that moment may strike some as a bit overdone, but at least you know that this is an actress who can summon real tears when they're needed.

It's very easy to come away from a movie like the BODYGUARD feeling like you've been manipulated, but actually, it would have been naive to expect much else.  Hollywood movies about Hollywood life have an odd tension in them.  On the one hand, they can poke a few jabs at the superficiality and the glitz of So. Cal. ""culture,""  on the other hand they assume that the dream factory really is the object of fascination (and dreams) of their audience.  And maybe they're right to an extent.  But watching this movie some 15 years on, I couldn't help flashing on some of Ms Houston's subsequent career set backs and thining that this '92 film really is a sort of (inadvertant) indictment of show a biz culture that spoils and corrupts its ""players"" no matter how talented they are and, rather than fostering the creative process, actually works AGAINST it.",1182297600,3,2818,4.577689243027889

I first saw The Bodyguard in a hot summer day. I waited in a long queue for my ticket and the theatre was fully packed. Tired and frustrated, I could not enjoy the film but it grew in me over time. It was different experience when I saw it again. In fact, The Bodyguard is a serious, original and very well told story. Love can be as real as me, sitting and writing here, and still be impossible and bitter-sweet. I can relate to this. Don't we all go through it at lst once in our lifetime?

I love Kevin Costner's performance as Frank  Farmer. I find him very convincing in the skin of this tough, self-disciplined guy with a heart of gold. I admire Kevin's portrayal of Frank's emotional  torment when he had to choose between his duty and his heart.

Too many suckers fall for this kind of thing, when they see a special edition of their favourite movies, only to be disappointed. I'm disappointed, cos I couldn't even sit through the whole featurette, but I bought mine on the cheap. So it's not that big a loss. And lets face it, Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" spent about 14 weeks (correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm just guessing) at the top of the UK charts, and I'm sick of seeing the video now. 13 years after the film was originally released would have warranted some decent extras. I suppose we'll have to wait until the 25th anniversary of this film to see if we get any decent DVD release - which so didn't happen with Grease, it's well past it's 25th anniversary, and still no special edition.

Back to the film. I love this movie! The only thing that's stopping it from getting four stars is the dismal DVD release. It's so nice to see Whitney Houston the way she was, rather than the way she is now - talk about fame going to your head. She's never had a big a hit as she did with the aforementioned song, and that's been her downfall. The soundtrack album to this movie became one of the largest-selling soundtrack albums in history.

According to Soundscan, the top-selling soundtrack was ""Saturday Night Fever"" album with 22 million albums sold to date.

It's also my favourite Kevin Costner movie so far, as he's absolutely terrific in this. And for once, there's actually some chemistry between the two lead stars, which always helps towards a ""romantic comedy"".

They don't want to cut short their hazardous activities and attitudes of direct contact with the public and then it becomes easy for any would-be killer to perform their acts. This film also reveals that the contact between the bodyguard and the guarded person has to be entirely and only professional not to be disturbed by any personal and emotional element. This is hard to accept for a showbizz person who always sentimentalizes and personalizes the relations they entertain with their surrouding personnel. Yet the bodyguard in this mission will save the actress's son and then the actress herself in particularly public and dramatic conditions. The film will also create some justice when the killer executes the actress's sister who has been the one who paid for the elimination of her sister out of spite and jealousy. In other words the film is interesting because it erases as much sentimental mulk as possible only to retain the professional dimension of the mission.

Whitney Houston made her film debut with this film co-starring and produced by Kevin Costner. The film got mixed reviews ( more bad than good ) and didn't do so great at the box office. It was the music that was the ultimate highlight. Without Whitney's hit soundtrack, The Bodyguard would have sunk faster than the Titanic.

The Bodyguard disappoints from the getgo with it's half-done plot and unbelievable script. Kevin Costner is disappointing. Back then he'd finished Dances With Wolves and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. His career had never been so high but the bomb of The Bodyguard proved it only takes one film to slow down a career. The major flaw was Whitney Houston. Whitney's acting was terrible despite this being her first film. I was disappointed because I've seen Whitney acting on sitcoms from the 80s and her acting was better then than it was in The Bodyguard. Costner and Houston had no chemistry. Why did they have to be romantically involved? Oh...I remember...to sell those sappy love songs on the soundtrack. That had to be the only reason because the film would have been better without the forced love story. Whitney's character was unbelievable. No one is so self-centered that they will risk their life just to go shopping. Nothing added up and if it wasn't for the soundtrack this film wouldn't be memorable at all. But now that it's twelve years later the soundtrack is even forgettable.  Can't really recommend this DVD. There were no extra features and the movie was only available in standard!  WB has to do better with their DVDs. The Bodyguard has some entertaining points but it can't hold its own with acting, plot or excitement.

Skip the film but buy the soundtrack. "" I Have Nothing "" is one of the most beautiful songs ever made.",1094256000,5,1855,4.766355140186916

 Did anybody notice they used *both* possible endings? There's ""the bodyguard turns his back on happiness and goes on to do his duty with a stiff upper lip"" and there's ""the singer turns back at the last minute and flings herself into his arms"" ending, and I'll be damned if they're not both used, one after the other. The technical term for this is a ""contradiction"", something you want to avoid in a narrative, particularly at the climax. I've never seen this particular trick used before.

100667,5,0790729709,"When this movie first came out the critics panned it mercilessly and frankly I just can't understand why.  I thought it was fabulous.  Kevin Costner plays an ex-Secret Service agent hired to protect a spoiled, difficult to get along with diva receiving death threats.  Whitney Houston portrays the spoiled starlet to perfection.  The chemistry and interplay between Houston and Costner was electric.  The music in the movie was also great.
There are really some key elements that made this movie extremely good.  First, I thought the acting was top notch by all involved.  The supporting cast really played their characters well, as did the stars.  Secondly, the editing was outstanding.  The movie and plot move along at a fast pace.  There is not a dull moment in the entire movie.  And finally, the plot was plausible (for the most part) and the mystery - who is the hit man - slowly reveals itself.  Having watched the movie several times, there a several foreshadowings.
Overall I found it a most entertaining movie both as a mystery, a thriller, and love story.",1090108800,165,1067,4.866666666666666

100669,3,0790729709,"You're going to see ""The Bodyguard"" spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of ""The Simpsons"" with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song ""I Will Always Love You"" swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.
Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. ""The Bodyguard"" is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.
The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.
Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you.
""The Bodyguard"" is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numerous times, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.
I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!
I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in ""The Untouchables,"" opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.
For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).
The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it. But I don't respect it.",1069977600,4,3599,4.546995377503852
100670,5,0790729709,"Wow...This movie is the best I've ever seen. It was supposed to go to Diana Ross and some other guy. I'm glad the roll went to Whitney. Diana would not fit this roll. Wow, three lines into the review and I'm already off task. Okay. Why should you give this movie a chance? Because it's amazing. Whitney proves she is a great actress and singer. Her voice makes this movie even better. The songs fit perfectly. And Kevin Costner, this movie alone makes me a fan, and I haven't seen his other work. It leaves you in suspense, as a mysterious stalker is following Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) step by step, waiting for the time to attempt in killing her. This movie has a dark atmosphere, which is something I love about it. It's not like most love stories. I was very unsure about trying this movie, because I get bored easily, and I'm not a big romance movie fan, but this movie is so different from a typical romance film. It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. I'm thrilled Kevin talked Whitney into this film, although it took her over a year to decide, it was worth it.

I think Whitney did such a good job in the role because she was basically playing herself and didn't have that far to stretch acting-wise. The chemistry between Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner seemed pretty good, but Costner seemed so dry much of the time, but maybe that suited his character more - someone who doesn't let his feelings show. I heard that this movie was originally going to be made with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross. I'm sure that would have been an interesting and good pairing, but I can't imagine anyone else but Whitney Houston playing the role of superstar singer, Rachel Marron.",1049155200,5,741,4.796875

He wanted a real singer for his love interest and picking someone as gorgeous as Whitney wasn't bad.
I did love the entire movie, I loved Kevin and Whitney's characters, they both had annoying flaws and yet they drew you into their lives in such an amazing way.  It was wonderful to see the lifestyle more closely of both a bodyguard and an entertainer.

This DVD isn't really good as far as special features, but the movie is as good as it was 10 years ago. Whitney is excellent in her film debut, and Kevin is no worse than he usually is. The only big problem with this movie is that Whitney's character, Rachel, curses more than half the time. If you have a child that you don't think is old enough to listen to Whitney Houston saying the F word, I suggest you tape this off TV (it's always on) and watch that copy when with your child, as they always edit the curses out. Other than these things, this movie is excellent, suspenseful, romantic, and gives you insight into the dangerous life of a superstar.

To its credit  though the soundtrack is magnificent with Houston singing such great tracks  as, I HAVE NOTHING and I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU with all her heart and soul.
