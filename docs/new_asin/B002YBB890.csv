8384121,5,B002YBB890,"Jason Gibson is a genius!! I ordered all of his chemistry, his calculus and all of his physics!! So far I have just completed the chemistry and I have such a greater understanding because of this man.  He breaks everything down to such a simple easy to understand format. Please, Jason Gibson, come out with an organic chemistry tutor DVD set!!",1423008000,,344,4.639344262295082
8384122,5,B002YBB890,Best tutoring resource I have ever came across!!! I have or will be getting all his dvds.  I wish he had more engineering and physics ones.,1382486400,,139,4.346153846153846
8384123,5,B002YBB890,This DVD was a very useful addition to my coursework.. sometimes professors are just not that great at explaining certain concepts or demonstrating enough examples.. The Physics Tutor does a great job to introduce all the concepts you need to know with lots of examples. You can also find some great resources on youtube in this regard but I can vouch for these DVDs from my experience.,1365897600,,386,4.776119402985074
8384124,5,B002YBB890,"First, as the word TUTOR implies and the screen shots of a guy in front of a white board doing problems suggests this is a DVD to help you learn how to do physics problems. It is not a DVD on the history of physics or a physics is great kind of set. It is simply a supplement to help you learn the process of how to do problems. So, for anyone in the same shoes as the two star reviewer who was undoubtedly looking for something very different, that should be clarified. If you have not in physics or close to taking physics this is probably not for you. You would be better off looking for a good documentary. Also if watching a taped lecture does not fit your learning style you would probably not get the most out of these.

For those of you who have the need for it, this is the best set that presents problems in the same manner as the material is covered in your book. One thing I like how Jason has structured this DVD and volume 2 of this set is he introduces a topic, gives some of the theory behind it and presents the equations in one section, then the problems on that topic in a separate section. This helps split some of the material up, especially when the ""lecture"" material can take over an hour for some of the topics. It just makes things flow better, and he can give more example problems that way.

Like the predecessor physics DVDs he has put out it is geared more toward algebra based physics than calculus, although he does begin to add more of the calculus theories for some of the material. Some of the problems he goes through requires very basic integration, and since you should have had at least a year of calculus by the time you get to this material they are really no problem. He does a lot more deriving in this series than he has in the others, and really does try to show how the various electric field and electric potential equations are related.  But unlike what you may get in class he does not skip steps or presume you know more than you really do, and of course if you do not follow it the first time around you can re-watch the sections.  At the core it is giving you examples of how the questions are worded, and strategies for how to solve them. The problems range from very easy ""plug and chug"" examples, to more complex deriving and proof kinds of problems where you are manipulating the formulas but are not given numbers. If used as a supplement to class and homework this will help you immensely.",1341014400,,2447,4.278617710583154
8384125,2,B002YBB890,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway,  I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students.  However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject.  I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.

8384126,5,B002YBB890,Jason Gibson is an excellent tutor.  I wish I had his dvd's two years ago. They are a great help.,1302998400,,97,3.85
8384127,5,B002YBB890,"If you need help with your physics class, or if like me you just enjoy this stuff, then purchase these videos. Electricity and magnetism can be a tough subject and I am an electrician by trade. Jason makes it easy. If you find your math skills wanting go back and get his calculus series as well. Keep them handy for review. That is what I do. You will not be diappointed in either product.",1274054400,3,390,4.283783783783784
8384128,5,B002YBB890,"This is an invaluable resource!  Use this or any of Jason Gibson's videos before you start the course, and you have the necessary background knowledge your professor somehow assumes you have and then some.  Of course, these are a great resource to watch again and again while doing your physics homework.  Please make more at higher levels Mr. Gibson.",1265760000,4,351,4.915254237288136
8384129,5,B002YBB890,"I just finished watching these four videos, they are great for anyone taking a physics course in electricy, I will go as far as saying if you are taking a physics course right now, (PLEASE) give a copy to your professor, because most of the time they either don't know what they are talking about or they just don't know how to explain. Mr Jason does a SUPER job, hope he makes the sequal to this introductory course, circuits and so on...from one to five stars, I give in 10 stars.",1263081600,7,482,4.3076923076923075
