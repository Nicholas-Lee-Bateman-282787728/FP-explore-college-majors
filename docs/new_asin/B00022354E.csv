2055080,5,B00022354E,I absolutely adore the ai yori yoshi series with its sappy mushy storyline of two starcrossed fiances (kaoru&aoi)and a houseful of hopeful girls wanting to catch kaoru's eye. i personally have never seen the enshi series but from what i get from the review above i think it will be an awsome sequel to the great fanservicing series ai yori aoshi!,1089763200,9,346,4.688524590163935
2055081,5,B00022354E,"Ai Yori Aoshi is a great anime.
Ai Yori Aoshi ~ Enishi is a great sequel to that anime...
...but....
If you're looking for closure to the main storyline, you'll have to join me in hoping for a third series.
The storyline for Enishi is pretty good, mostly following Tina (though too much time is spent wasted on Chika at the begining) and it's a bit sad, but very good. Enishi is far more delves far more seriously into relationships than the original series.
The ending, while not offering complete resolution, is still pretty good.
I hope there'll be a third series:)
BTW, Tina Foster is the #2 anime character ever! ~(2nd only to the one and only, Aoyama Motoko.)",1083542400,8,665,4.55

8020195,5,B00022354E,"Ai Yori Aoshi is the story of 2 childhood friends whose arranged marriage is nullified after Kaoru leaves his family. Years later his former betrothed, Aoi,finds him and still intends to marry him. He is skeptical at first, but soon comes around after seeing that she is sweet and pure of heart. She's pretty much the perfect young lady. Her family is against her stubborn intention to stay with Kaoru. In order to avoid  scandal, they set them up in a huge summer home and call Kaoru a tenant and Aoi the landlord. Along with Aoi's cartaker, and several other college friends, the young couple begins their journey together. Everyday they get to know each other better and love each other more. As this happens, they have a harder time keeping their relationship a secret.

In volume 1, all the residents of the Sakuraba home return, along with Chika. They all have fun making friends, going on trips, playing tennis, and looking for ghosts. This DVD gives you a sense of relief that nothing has changed and the characters you love so much are here to stay.

This is a great anime series. Enishi is the 2nd season of Ai Yori Aoshi. It isn't much different from season 1. It's more of the same stuff, but that's okay. It stays interesting and lots of fun. It is hard to compare this series to another. It's closest to Clannad I think. Just not nearly as emotional, and there is a bit more fan service. Enishi is shorter than the 1st season, it's only 12 episodes. It also doesn't really resolve anything. The series ends with everything much the as it was in the beginning of the show with everyone living together happily. It's okay though, that's really how you want it to end. Rather than hearts being broken and people drifting apart like in real life, everybody lives happily ever after under the same roof. Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi is a great series any way that you look at it. It's one you'll always look back upon with fond memories.",1353888000,,1938,4.54727793696275

8020197,5,B00022354E,"Greetings;

Years back, I had rented the ai yori aoshi series, liked it well enough and always just sort of figured I would pick them up someday. Someday was within the last month or so. Enishi however was something else altogether. Never saw it when I rented the other, wasn't available at the time. Figured I would pick it up as the second season and all, but couldn't for the life of me figure out what made the individual dvd's normal or limited editions. I looked over a couple of the reviews and largely found people talking about the show, which is fine-look at me, sharing my life story and all. What I found after ultimatly having to buy the whole-3 disk set-limited edition-twice I might add, was the following:

Volume 1 has the dvd, normal enough. Has a box meant to hold the three volumes to the set. Is meant to come with a box containing an unassembled Aoi-chan figurine. Unassembled, but still painted. Is the first of five figurines.

Volume 2 has the second dvd, again, normal. Also comes with a box meant to contain Unassembled Taeko and Mayu figurines

Volume 3 has the third dvd, no different from the normal edition, as with the others. Also comes with the box of unassembled figurines, this time of Chika and Tina.

All figurines are by Yujin. Just remember to make sure that if you order the limited editions, that you are getting what you ordered. I ordered a used like new copy of the first volume, had the box meant to hold the three dvd's(in cases) and the first dvd but no figurine. Had to re-order. The second I had to re-order was simply unavailable and had to get it from someone else but the third I had to replace came with the DVD and the box meant to hold the figurines, the dvd was new and unopened, seemed all was still in its original wrappings-the Sticker saying that the soundtrack was available from Geneon. No figurines in the box. Would think the seller would have noticed or said something about it in their listing, but still.

Take it from me, you might want to just write your seller of choice and ask first to make sure everything is as it should be, should you consider getting the limited editions like I did.

Thank you...",1326499200,,2174,4.474747474747475
8020198,5,B00022354E,"***SPOILERS!!***

Ai Yori Aoshi is one of my most favorite animes of all time. It's light-hearted, funny and enjoyable to watch whenever you want to feel happy. The characters are funny and you bond with them. The only complaint is, they ended the anime series right in the middle of the manga!

The Enishi season however was kind of weird. The opening sequence had a bunch of scenes that was from the manga, such as a frame where Chika is kneeling down looking at snow. That was an important chapter in the manga where she was thinking about Kaoru and he miraculously appeared to her. Since the beginning of the anime of ""enishi"" focused so much on Chika, why couldn't they have included that episode?

Another, really noticable scene in the opening is when a young Miyabi holds Aoi as an infant. I mean, if you're gonna put these scenes in the opening sequence, why isn't it in the series?! Yes, Miyabi's past isn't revealed at all in the anime about how she was an orphan and the Sakurabas took her in to raise baby Aoi, leading up to the two of them becoming sisters unrelated by blood. I mean, shouldn't that have been included in the anime?

The biggest plot they skipped that started everything in the last part of the manga that wasn't covered in the anime, was episode 9 ""White."" In the anime, you should wonder why Miyabi was talking to Kaoru for so long. I doubt it took like 2 hours to approve of Aoi and Kaoru spending the night together in the hotel and then them talking about their futures. Yes, in the anime they missed the most important thing that continued the manga into it's rather ""darker"" storyline. Miyabi asked Kaoru if he can find a way to reconsider going back to the Hanabishi's for the sake of Aoi's happiness. This leads him on a journey to try to fix all the problems, along with Tina's arc still present as she seems to reveal to Aoi that she likes Kaoru. That's all the anime did was talk on the phone about Aoi and then everything was alright. Miyabi didn't ask Kaoru to reconsider going back to Hanabishi. Another scene from the opening sequence shows Kaoru in Miyabi's office as she's hiding her face in disappointment. ""THAT"" was a key scene in the manga also when Kaoru told her he wasn't going back to the Hanabishi's.  Again, a really noticable scene in the opening shows Aoi embracing Kaoru while crying and then shouting something. Manga perhaps? Yes, it's right after the ""White"" episode where Kaoru ""should have"" journeyed back to the Hanabishi's only Aoi doesn't approve of him risking his own pain for her and that her being with him is good enough. It's not really that important, but the scene where Taeko mops the floor in the opening sequence is the same scene in episode 1 ""Spring Blossom"" only she mops up to the camera with half the speed. Look into that. The last key scene the was in the manga but not in the anime. During Kaoru's travels, Tina follows him resulting in the two of them staying in a hotel. As he falls asleep first, she kisses him. Yeah. For some reason, the opening sequence for this season is a collection of scenes that were in the last story arc of the manga. Of course, you won't see Kaoru's younger brother because that is another manga detail that isn't in the anime.

The anime of ""Enishi"" has a slice-of-life genre where they will face things everyday that any normal person might, whether its practicing for a casual game of tennis, going on a date for the first time, thinking your house is haunted and wanting to hunt for ghosts, studying for a test, learning how to swim, etc. The anime didn't look very much for plot in my opinion, except when Tina's Arc is covered in the last three episodes, revolving around the theme of ""Bonds and fate."" Don't get me wrong, I completely love this anime. I'm only complaining because I want more! Overall, the entire series is an anime that people will most likely watch again and again only because the series is fun, light-hearted and will make you smile. The English dub is great too! Also, don't compare Ai Yori Aoshi to Love Hina! Love Hina is annoying because all the girls are bitches and Kitsune and Su's English voices are horrible! I'd say both of them are evil versions of Tina and Chika. So, yeah. If you haven't watched this anime, watch it, but watch the 1st season first! You won't be disappointed if you like animes about drama and romance if you're tired of those giant robots and demons.",1291248000,,4428,4.514962593516209
8020199,4,B00022354E,"I accidentally saw the first eight episodes of Enishi, the second season of Ai Yori Aoshi, before backtracking to the first season.  I was so enchanted with Aoi Sakuraba, the kindly soft-spoken landlady in the indigo kimono, I felt I made a new friend that day.  Enishi lasted for twelve episodes.  The second season's subtitle ""enishi"" harkens back to the first season, as the first episode was titled ""Enishi.""

Aoi tells the precocious and cute Chika Minazuki ""Enishi means the bonds that tie people to one another.  Everyone here is tied to one another by Enishi.  That's why we all met, tied to each other by Enishi.""  There is a mystical and deterministic spiritual sense there, of how the various lines of fate intertwine to form those bonds, and yet it was meant to happen.  Anyway, two years have passed since Kaoru Hanabishi and Aoi Sakuraba were united.  The romantic mood is set by Aoi gazing at the cherry blossom petals drifting with the gentle breeze, highlighted by her savouring the mood, eyes closed, arms outstretched, remembering the anniversary.

We meet Chika Minazuki's two best friends at Fujimino High School for Girls, the lively Natsuki Komiya and shy but gentle Chizuru Aizawa, all three the most serious members of the swim team.  When Natsuki discovers a photo of Chika and Kaoru, and the former says that they live together, Natsuki and Chizuru freak out big time, thinking she's gone to third base with Kaoru at so young an age.  That demands a visit to the Sakuraba mansion on Sunday.  However, Chika's nervousness at trying to keep her friends away from Kaoru so they won't ask him questions leads to all sorts of comedy, including a fight between Natsuki and Mayu.

When Chika needs help practicing tennis at high school, it turns into a tennis outing for the gang, with Miyabi-san being their coach.  Aoi turns up with a very fetching outfit, a change from her usual kimono.  But there's lots of mischief and ginger from Tina, who flips up tennis skirts, and in the showers, gets to fondle the other girls, all of which is overheard by Kaoru.

There are some salacious moments involving Aoi in a pink apron and nothing else.  When Kaoru says he wants dinner first, she removes her kimono and says, ""Please eat up.""  Yeah boy!

When Tina is freaked out on some strange noises from the attic at night, it's up to Taeko, who's a bit of an occult freak, to lead the gang to exorcise the ghost.  Tina's a cowardly lion here, so clearly monsters are her Achilles heel.  However, this is a throwaway episode, an excuse for all of them to cosplay in the Shinto priest robes a la Kikyo in Inuyasha.

The special Christmas episode, ""Miyuki,""--beautiful snow in Japanese, is set before the first season.  Kaoru is rewarded with a day with Santa when he finds the pendant without which she cannot return home.  Santa suspiciously looks like a certain cute woman who habitually wears a blue kimono.  A more preferable secular role for Santa is demonstrated.  Santa Aoi says ""The presents we give to children are not objects.  We let them see pleasant and happy times in their dreams. ... Their joy, even if it's only an instant, is our joy.""  Less materialistic for sure.  This was featured in the sixth manga, in which it was confirmed that some time after this, Kaoru and Aoi were reunited.  However, a continuity question arises.  Chika and Taeko clearly see Kaoru when he's with Santa Aoi, so why don't they remember him when they first meet?  And why doesn't Mayu recognize Kaoru, having met him previously?

Finally, there is some idea of where Kaoru and friends live.  Chika meets and later sees off her friends at Shiki Station.  They are near Fujimi City in Saitama Prefecture, about 30 km away from Tokyo.  Shiki and Fujimino, four stations away, are served by the Tobu Tojo line which runs from Ikebukuro in Tokyo to Yorii in Saitama.

Good start to the second season, let down by the silly poltergeist episode.  Overall rating:  4.4, rounded down to 4.  The limited edition of this comes with an Aoi Sakuraba capsule toy.",1152748800,,4056,4.712660028449502
8020200,4,B00022354E,"It is so good to see these characters again, I can somewhat forgive the lack of progress in Aoi and Kaoru's relationship.  Two years have passed since the last series, Ai Yori Aoshi, ended.  The harem is still living in the mansion, Kaoru is still going to school.  Aoi and Kaoru are still keeping their relationship a secret.  I know at least one big shake up is ahead, but ""Fate"" is all lightness and fluff.

There is a sweet, bonus Christmas episode, unrelated to the storyline.  It takes place a few years before Kaoru met Aoi.

Episode 1 - Spring Blossoms - Chika queries everyone whether or not they ""love Big Brother?""  She hounds everyone 24/7.  How can she be shut up without revealing the girls' true feelings?

Episode 2 - Friends - Chika's school friends find a picture of Kaoru in her wallet.  They are shocked when Chika says she lives with him.  Her friends come to the mansion to investigate.  When they meet the whole gang, they get more than they bargained for.

Episode 3 - Tennis - Everyone dons cute tennis outfits (except Kaoru) and have at it on the courts.  This is the first time we see Aoi being something other than a traditional Japanese housewife (even though she is not married).

Episode 4 - Phantom - Just in time for summer, we have a mandatory ghost episode.  Like we learn something surprising about Aoi in Tennis, we learn something about Tae in this episode.

Bonus Episode - Sugary Christmas fluff.  Aoi is Santa - the REAL Santa.  Kaoru teaches her the true meaning of the Christmas spirit.  This is a touching episode.",1132876800,,1558,4.552346570397112
8020201,5,B00022354E,"The 2nd season of Ai Yori Aoshi started out good! Actually, so good in fact that it gives you that feeling of reuniting all the fun you had with the first season. Aoi's ukeness is still there. Chika's cuteness is still there. Miyabi's nagginess is still there. Hell, even Tina's booze drinking is still there! ^o^

This 13 episode season has some of the cutest moments, and I love seeing Aoi and Kaoru share intimate moments. It shows how strong love can be, even in the modern world of angst. Though is it just me, or does Enishi have lots more fan service than before? Very Love Hina like, well sorta! Tina Foster is so freaking hilarious, and hearing her in the dub is a treat. Who doesn't love a hyper american fondling boobs *o* She's my idol! LOL

The dubbing isint that bad either! They perfected Aoi's submissive tone, Taeko's clumsy tone and Tina's southern USA tone convinced me. Though some of the secondary characters sounded whacked. Both Pioneer(Geneon) ADV Films, etc. never had a perfect cast of VAs, but rarely get close.

I truely recommend it to those who loved the original season <3 Though I don't recommend it to Love Hina fans, don't expect Kaoru to get knocked 1,000 feet in the air and still survive @o@ Anyway The opening ""Takaramono"" and closing ""I do"" are wonderful! Yoko Ishida's Takaramono is just as memorable as Towa no Hana.

I'm a legend in the Otaku world, and I recommend this anime! Whoever doesn't thinks so, well too bad! Cliches are cliches, and Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi lives up to it's 24 episode original.",1104019200,13,1544,4.6036363636363635
