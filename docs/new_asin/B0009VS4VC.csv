I feel ripped of.

8067717,4,B0009VS4VC,"The first episode 'One Armed Bandits' is a fun watch and shows the portions that are used in the opening credits which some viewers may never have seen before.  Also the big jump is in this episode, it pretty much broke the car in half.

Burt Reynolds is mentioned because the idea of the Dukes came from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokey-and-the-Bandit/dp/B002ZWQL3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokey and the Bandit</a>.

8067718,5,B0009VS4VC,"I bought this DVD set for my husband, and he loves it.  On a rainy/snowy day when we can't get any work done...he pops it in and enjoys watching some of the old shows.  This has been a great investment (we own all the seasons) for our boys.  It's a great show for all ages and our 9 year old loves the ""Duke Boys"" just like his daddy.  If you enjoy watching the Dukes of Hazzard when it was on television, they you'll love these DVDs.",1265587200,3,434,4.011627906976744

8067720,5,B0009VS4VC,I grew up watching Bo and Luke Duke.  I love all the things they get into...and the ways they find to get out of them.  Good clean fun.  Little or no cursing throughout all the series of the Dukes of Hazard.,1224806400,,207,4.0
8067721,3,B0009VS4VC,"This dvd contains the Dukes of Hazzard 49-minute 1979 pilot episode ""One Armed Bandits,"" as well as a bonus 10-minute feature on the 2005 film.

The story involves the good ol' boys saving an orphanage and was actually filmed in Georgia where the fictitious Hazzard County is supposed to reside (unlike future episodes filmed in Southern California).

This dvd is worthless to hardcore Dukes fans since the pilot episode is featured on the First Season collection.

To be honest, before buying this dvd I had never seen an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard in my life, although I've of course seen clips of the show while channel surfing.

My main interest in this dvd is Catherine Bach, who plays Daisy Duke. In her prime Catherine was one of the most beautiful women to grace God's earth and this pilot episode features her in all her awe-inspiring glory. She has some solid screen time and is shown in white ""daisy dukes"" (short shorts), denim daisy dukes and (whoa) a red bikini.

The episode itself is just harmless good ol' boys TV fun, but Catherine Bach is incredible. She was born in Warren, Ohio, not far from where I live in NE Ohio -- proof that our hometown babes are some of the finest in the world.

In fact, because of Catherine I can justly brag: OUR BABES ARE BETTER THAN YOUR BABES -- hah!",1220832000,,1306,4.55982905982906
