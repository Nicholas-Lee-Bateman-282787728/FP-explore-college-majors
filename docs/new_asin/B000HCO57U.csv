2634106,5,B000HCO57U,"One of the all-time great Film Noirs by one of the greatest of all European Directors slumming some time in Hollywood,
The Reckless Moment was tartly remade as The Deep End with Tilda Swinton. Watch them both for master class in great
acting and direction. James Mason was never better--matched perhaps by his monumental performance in Carol Reed's
Odd Man Out--and the mostly outdoor So-Cal settings, shot in gliding motion by Ophuls mobile camera--combine to make
a creepy, involving film that mashes up domestic tranquility with queasy moral panic. Brilliant. Utterly Brilliant.",1384646400,,581,5.326086956521739
2634107,1,B000HCO57U,"This Korean DVD of Max Ophuls ""The Reckless Moment"" was recorded at the wrong speed and the cast looks like they`re on speed. Voices are higher than normal. James Mason sounds like Tab Hunter, only British. Columbia should release this on DVD. They do good work when they get around to it. I hope they do it soon. I Ain`t Gettin` Any Younger And I Ain`t Gonna Wait To Long. I`ve returned my copy to Amazon and hopefully they will stop selling this botched version of a classic movie. But,Hey!

2634108,4,B000HCO57U,"This is the story of the thug with the heart of gold. It's a fun look at one of James Mason's earlier movies and his charm and caring nature is depicted nicely in a surprising venue. He is part of a two-man team of blackmailers, but he sees the pain it is causing his victim and tries to help protect her from his more dangerous partner. Nice little film especially for JM fans or fans of old movies.",1371168000,,400,4.141025641025641
2634109,5,B000HCO57U,"I wish I could write such eloquent movie reviews as the previous reviewer, unfortunately I can't, but I enjoy reading them.
""The reckless Moment"" is my favorite film noir (I would list ""Conflict"" (Bogart) and ""My Name is Julia Ross"" (Nina Foch) as my three favorite film noirs of all times).

Joan Bennett and James Mason are truly impressive and I've seen most of their movies over the past 40 years, but would rate this as their best film. Yes, I agree, they have great on screen chemistry, but Lucia Harper's husband does not come across as dull when you read the novel by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding which is called ""The Blank Wall"". In the book they seem to have a very loving relationship and both suffer from being separated for a while. It's a wonderful novel and I recommend it very much:

[....]

The only difference between the novel and the movie: the movie has been filmed in Balboa, CA, the novel is located on Long Island in NYC.

I wish there would be more movies like this.

Also great film noirs: ""Cause for Alarm"" (Loretta Young) and ""Out of the Past"" (Robert Mitchum.",1309046400,16,1084,4.538461538461538
2634110,5,B000HCO57U,"This film is rarely screened and seldom shown on tv, but it remains one of Ophuls' finest Hollywood films along with Caught and Letter From an Unknown Woman.  Recently remade as The Deep (with Tilda Swinton)the plot is built around a mother (Joan Bennett who co-produced with her husband Walter Wanger) who attempts to cover up what she assumes is a murder committed by her teenage daughter. Watch the film yourself to get the details because to know more is to spoil the suspense.  The story is complicated by the entrance of an underworld figure played by James Mason who is sent to blackmail the woman, only to find himself both admiring and falling in love with her. There are early feminist strands to the mix, a poignant love story, a noir thriller, the revelations of Ophuls moving camera, and one splendid minor performance by who plays the housekeeper. This is a haunting and beautiful film which reveals new levels of meaning and irony with every viewing. But stay away from this vendor. The transfer is adequate but second rate. The only other version I am aware of (and purchased)is British with a very good transfer (with useful extras) and available from Amazon UK. The catch is that you will need an all region DVD player (Phillips is functional if you have not purchased one).  This is a masterpiece that deserves the Criterion treatment, which will come eventually one hopes. Meanwhile, try to view it at the Museum of Modern Art or a similar venue in your region.  If you love the genre, or the director, or just wonderful screen acting (both Bennett and Mason are splendid)don't hesitate to make the trip. (And don't miss viewing Ophuls' Caught if you get the opportunity).
 This rating applies to the British version. I belong to a cinema society that has been burned by subpar copies of this vendor's films (specifically Journey to Italy and Letter from an Unknown Woman) so don't spoil your fun by purchasing from here.",1304553600,30,1941,4.7648809523809526

2634112,5,B000HCO57U,"'The Reckless Moment' is Max Ophuls' excellent 1949 suspense melodrama, starring James Mason as a blackmailer who falls in love with his desperate victim (Joan Bennett).

Ophuls direction is superb, with the suspense mounting in every scene as housewife Bennett, mistakenly believing her daughter has killed a man, disposes the body and tries desperately to hide the girl's involvement from the police and her family. Then Mason appears, demanding money for incriminating love letters he has which the daughter had written to the dead man. The plot thickens from there, with Bennett trying to shield her family from scandal as the blackmailer begins to admire and then love the devoted housewife and mother.

James Mason is always excellent in sinister roles, and his performance here is one of his best, though his character's motivation isn't quite clear. By his own admission, he's a loser who's never done a decent thing in his life, so why he suddenly develops a conscience is never fully explained.

But who wouldn't fall in love with beautiful Joan Bennett, giving the performance of her career as the desperate mother who's commonplace life is suddenly turned upside down by crime and blackmail. Ophuls, who the year before had guided Joan Fontaine through one of her greatest performances in 'Letter From an Unknown Woman,' drew from Bennett her most natural, believable performance. She's never been better.  Fans of tv's 'Dark Shadows' may especially enjoy finding out what a fine actress she was.

'The Reckless Moment' is not only a top notch suspense thriller, but a probing examination of suburban American life and a woman's place in it.  We are shown how limited a woman's resources and options are when faced with a crisis and how the husband holds all the power.

Highly recommended for the outstanding direction and two great stars in peak form.",1179619200,10,1865,5.055374592833876

It says All Regions on some of the info but not on other areas, where it says ""Region 2"" I didn't notice these until now and never understood it until now, but you'd think Amazon would be a bit more forthcoming about this.

8138450,5,B000HCO57U,"My introduction to Max Ophuls as a director. And to Joan Bennett as other than the femme fatale.

In this film Joan Bennett plays the part of Lucia Harper, an exemplary upper middle class mother, capable if somewhat cool and brusque, who finds herself thrust into an almost impossible situation following the accidental death of her daughter's boyfriend of whom she vehemently disapproves. Lucia exists as a single mother much of the time due to her husband's job which involves travel. She makes a lovely, ordered home with her kindly salt of a father-in-law (Henry O'Neill), high-spirited son (David Bair), and rebellious, angsty, arty teenage daughter Bea (Geraldine Page.)

One surreptitious meeting, one reckless moment, and Mrs. Harper's quiet, organized life is thrown into turmoil. Enter blackmailer Martin Donnelly (James Mason) with the goods to force her family into scandal, or worse, land her daughter in jail on suspicion of murder. Cool, calm, collected at first, Joan Bennett's character clings to her dignity while running the household for her unsuspecting family - with the able help of her maid Sybil (Frances E. Williams) shamefully uncredited for a solid supporting role. Lucia heaps the entire weight of secret upon herself while keeping one well-heeled step ahead of disaster. Ultimately this proves too much and she spirals into a desperate panic.

Martin finds himself drawn into Lucia's life as he meets with her to collect for his boss Ted Darby (Sheppard Strudwick). As Donnelly observes Lucia he realizes they are both a sort of prisoner of fate. Neither can ever live a life outside of the confines of what is expected of them. Both are caught in situations they can't abandon, with no possible extrication of either's duty. What begins as an admiration for Lucy's integrity grows into something deeper for Martin. Something that could be life-changing.

And the film's moving climax dares suggest that even out of bitterest circumstance, a type of redemption might be found.",1497484800,,2006,5.163076923076923
8138451,5,B000HCO57U,"This is my favorite film noir and also my favorite Joan Bennett movie (I collect them from TCM).  Comparing this with my other Bennett favorites like ""Man Hunt"", ""The Woman in the Window"", ""Scarlett Street"" and ""The Woman on the Beach"", TRM is far superior.
To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with Fritz Lang's ""Secret beyond the Door"", somehow I expected more.

The plot has been described often enough, so I rather mention that the story is based on a novel by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding which was published in LADIES HOME JOURNAL first, before it was published as a book.

The novel takes place in Long Island, NY, but having watched the movie first (and then read the novel) I find the Balboa location much more intriguing. Ever since I watched this movie for the first time, I was trying to find that house in which Lucia Harper's family lives in the movie on Google Earth/Satellite, but so far no luck.
Somebody said it's on Harbor Island near Balboa Island.

I also like the Sybill character, Lucia's kind and very helpful house keeper.

Bonus: an excellent review by Todd Haynes.",1469232000,,1090,4.68586387434555

8138453,5,B000HCO57U,"When is Joan Bennett thought of as an actress.... if Bennett is remembered at all.  Besides being absolutely beautiful?  Oh a long time ago in the 1940's Joan Bennett helped to define film nior in some nasty films.  She could femme fatale as the mood might strike.  But as an actress she is amazing in this film.  The camera moves in a way that is close to human time, well Bennett moves along in a way that is as if I were there, and I want to run away ,,, or yell stop, Please.  The film doesn't stop and neither does the plot, the black maid or Bennett.  Everything is moving in a different time at the same time.  The camera somehow keeps up with the emotion and the various movements as they play before, beside, with, or behind the Bennett character.  All in unique and different time.  As viewers. we must go along with what we are given. Helpless to interfere and no time to think of an alternative.  Max Ophuls as the director had a way to move the camera, or the point of view, so as we were  flying with the characters.  Bennett was a lady in real life?  Married to Walter Wanger who also produced this delicious film for his wife, Joan Bennett.  Google them both.  Beautiful people.  By 1951 Bennett's  career was in ruins as her husband suspecting Bennett's agent was having an affair with his wife shot the agent, went to jail for a few month's the agent recovered.  Bennett did not.  She couldn't find

 work for years.  Bennett remained married to Wanger to his death in 1965.  Joan Bennett.  Look her up and view her movie work.  An artist

This film haunts me.  Have never observed anxiety and panic in plot and portrayals.  One has to observe and being helpless we go along with the plot as given and we all have reckless moments.  Bennette does this in a way that takes the viewer in to her being.  The stars and the way of life as portrayed in this film are long gone.  The passion as the characters follow along a terrible road.  Her beauty never gets in the way.  It is her beauty that holds  the viewer to the end.

8138456,5,B000HCO57U,"Re-made withTilda Swinto to great effect, but this version is better. Joan Bennett is cool and collected, waiting for the moment when to explode, and James Mason could not be stranger here. Brilliant camera work, rich B&W and eerie scenes on the ocean and especially in Bennetts's  house, which has the look finally of a morgue.

Bennett and Mason are fabulous..don't miss this one.",1413849600,,382,4.953125
