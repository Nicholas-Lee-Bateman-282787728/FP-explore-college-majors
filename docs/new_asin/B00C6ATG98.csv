5691507,5,B00C6ATG98,"I watched Kimba in the 70's as a latch key kid.  My little brother and I would take the school bus home, do our homework and watched Kimba, Speed Racer & the Banana Splits.  Kimba was always my favorite.  The story line of The Lion King is lifted directly from Kimba the White Lion.  I am so glad this series is going to be available and am definitely pre-ordering it so my little one can carry on the tradition; of course I'll be watching right along with him. :)",1367539200,22,464,4.179775280898877

5691509,5,B00C6ATG98,"The video quality of the episodes in this DVD set are just amazing! This is a great show and it's great to see Kimba how he should be -- digitally remastered. (He's a white lion, not a yellow lion LOL.) The first episode is also completely uncut and contains the scene where Kimba's mom talks to him when he's swimming to safety. Highly recommended for anime, classic cartoon, and even Lion King fans.",1478304000,4,401,4.506849315068493

5691512,5,B00C6ATG98,"Great original artwork on each of the 10 discs in the set.

The video transfer was very good, no encoding artifacts, glitches or jitter. The audio was also well done with the clear English voice acting and music from the US airing in the 1960's.

A find filled with nostalgia for those that grew up with this classic.

It carries with it sincere lessons about caring for your environment and being kind to your neighbors (no matter how different they may be from you.)

If you have young children or grandchildren they will surely enjoy seeing Kimba and his friends.",1467417600,3,566,4.63

5691521,5,B00C6ATG98,"Let me just say that before I recieved this DVD, it left the state, went to about three different post offices and disappeared. We thought we were going to lose it. When it finally arrived at my home, I was relieved and really happy. I love and appreciate this box set even more after that experience! I'm a 15 year old fan of classic anime and manga, especially the works of Osamu Tezuka. I like the old stuff! ""Jungle Emperor,"" AKA: ""Kimba The White Lion"" is a great series that I have grown to love. I had already seen the epic movie ""Jungle Emperor Leo"" and the tv series ""Leo the Lion."" I knew I had to see the story of Leo/Kimba from the beginning-- when he was a cub. Each episode is like an adventure, even though there are some trippy moments(the movie has those too), and the characters are loveable.

What I love most about this anime is the little things. First, the animation is great, beautiful even. I found myself forgetting that this was a product of the 1960s! I've seen videos of the original Japanese openings and endings on YouTube. These songs were cut out of the English version, but they often play in instrumental form in the background. The animals were even humming the Japanese ending theme in one episode! It made me very happy. Yes, it warms my heart to hear the ORIGINAL soundtrack in a dubbed anime because I know that the original composers' work is not being wasted or scrapped. However, it gets even better! I have seen 26 episodes so far, but I have heard untranslated Japanese songs twice in two different episodes. This was the last thing I was expecting. The first song was a lullaby that Kimba's mother used to sing to him in the episode ""Scrambled Eggs"", and the second was an eerie night serenade sung by owls in ""The Gigantic Grasshopper."" The narrator said this was ""owl language"", but I knew better. This was very well done and I appreciate it because it is uncommon in Americanized anime. I'd like to know if anyone who watched ""Kimba"" in the 1960s remembers hearing something like that. I usually choose subs over dubs, but this is one dub I actually like. The voice actors do an okay job and the narrator's voice is soothing. Overall, it's a good quality anime that I will cherish forever. Thanks,Tezuka!",1434931200,9,2252,4.533169533169533

5691530,5,B00C6ATG98,"After trying for several years to get this set at a reasonable price, I finally succeeded.  This series is one of several I used to watch at home while on summer vacation from school (it was broadcast late weekday mornings).  Dealing with the animal world and how humans relate to it and how animals relate to each other, it was great fun.  I'm sure other fans out there will enjoy it.",1402012800,4,385,4.394366197183099
5691531,5,B00C6ATG98,Great stories wonderful animation. Sound quality is very good. Would recommend this set to anyone who enjoyed this set as a child,1398729600,2,129,4.909090909090909
5691532,5,B00C6ATG98,Husband and I remembered watching this as children.  Bought it to share with our Grandson.  I think we enjoyed it as much if not more than our grandson!  lol,1395446400,5,157,4.344827586206897
5691533,5,B00C6ATG98,It is one of the few classic cartoon series that teaches real values. It exemplifies good over evil in nearly every episode.,1384992000,3,124,4.681818181818182
5691534,5,B00C6ATG98,"I loved Kimba when I was a kid and my children's response to it has been just as positive. This series offers an interesting insight into the era of the 60s and touches surprisingly on a number of issues that were evident even in the 70s. While the treatment of issues such as deforestation may not have been too sophisticated, it sheds light on why people on this planet have avoided the most pressing issue of our lives - that of the degrading environment and climate change. From this perspective, Kimba can also be instructive to us older kiddies too.",1383523200,7,555,4.56
5691535,5,B00C6ATG98,I grew up watching this cartoo & now my kids like it 2. Well done price & quality is great as it always is with amazon. Well done again.,1376870400,3,136,3.7241379310344827
5691536,4,B00C6ATG98,I too was tricked into re-buying this based on the early press release...it was to have both japanese language with original soundtrack..as well as the English dubbed versions etc etc etc.....but it's as plain as you can get....english only nothing special as all.... not even a booklet!!! Yes i'm glad it's back in print for those who haven't bought previous versions.....at least they are not on double sided discs..so it could be worse...but I am a bit dissapointed,1373760000,10,468,5.012820512820513
5691537,4,B00C6ATG98,"This new 2013 Kimba set was to have had the original Japanese language with English subtitles. It is dubbed in English as the first set is.  I had bought this new set to finally enjoy the original story as it is said to be different than what we had aired in the United States.

But Rightstuf seems to have changed the box set features as was stated in its press release at the time. Even on the Rightstuf website it tsaes if You Pre-order with them they will send an Exclusive Gift with Purchase...but they changed their monds on that as well.

So now I have two Kimba sets. The episodes are the same. Why did I upgrade?

Because I believed the Press Release! Read the Product Details on Amazon then read the Editorial Reviews. Why not change them to say the same thing instead of changing the info in the Editorial Review?

Beware if Your buying this for the Japanese language feature. It is in English as the Ultra Box Set. They have changed the info now after the orders have been sent out.

I gave it 4 stars because I was tricked into buying this becuase of the info Rightstuf released to promote this product on Amazon and Tvshowsondvd. I could have saved my $53.00.

I recieved my copy from Rightstuf a few days ago before the release date listed here.",1371513600,22,1260,4.381974248927039
8577615,4,B00C6ATG98,the original lion king before Disney stole it,1520208000,,45,4.75
8577616,2,B00C6ATG98,"I bought this as a 10 disc box set, outer chipboard box with 2 normal sized dvd cases (5 discs in each case) direct from Right Stuf . If you're a Tezuka fan, it's great to have all 52 episodes in one set even though it's only English dubbed.  Would have loved to hear the original Japanese audio!

Sadly the video on this set is VERY compressed, with heavy digital artifacting (blocky pixelization) especially noticeable in the nearly constant solid color backgrounds. This poor video quality was unexpected since the aesthetic presentation of the box and my experience with other Nozomi releases were all great.  They must have been provided with over-processed masters from the licensor.  I contacted Right Stuf and their response was something like ""This show is from the 1960s and doesn't translate perfectly to DVD.""  Ha!  Amazing that anyone thinks that is reality, especially the company who released this set.

So, it's a double edged sword...I love owning this series even if it's only the dubbed version, but the video quality is SO sub-par that I'm not sure I'll actually watch it very often.  I will probably sell this as soon as it's out of print and hope somebody releases this set properly in the future.",1519171200,,1219,4.7990430622009566
8577617,5,B00C6ATG98,I gave this as a gift to my grand daughter who is big into anime.  I enjoyed showing her that it was here in the 70's!  She turned 11 and was excited to have it.  She loves to draw in this style.,1516406400,,195,3.5952380952380953

8577619,5,B00C6ATG98,"This is exactly what I was hoping for. All episodes from 1960s dub in one collection.
I was hoping it also contained the Japan Dub, but I'm not complaining. Its still the best thing yet!

8577622,5,B00C6ATG98,"My goodness this series is better than I could have ever remembered it!  A true glimpse at the early days of TV animation.  Politically incorrect, but with massive heart, Kimba often deals with serious issues that a child indeed can understand without candy coating.

I remember watching the series at a very young age in the late 70s, but did not remember anything specific about the episodes.  My daughter and I are loving the show.",1486080000,,434,4.746666666666667
