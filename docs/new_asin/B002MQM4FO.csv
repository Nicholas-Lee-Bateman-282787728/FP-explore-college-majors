3952361,5,B002MQM4FO,"For My Father (  ):  I, too, loved this film deeply.  As has been mentioned, no politics, just humans.  After all, we are all the same underneath.  Maybe with a little more love, respect, and giving, we wouldn't have as many problems in the world as we have.  I have a very deep love for both the Jews and the Arabs and have somewhat of a working knowledge of both Arabic and Hebrew.  [WARNING:  SPOILER]  I must admit I had difficulty understanding the ending, as one other reviewer mentioned.  Terek obviously intended not to hurt as many people in the marketplace, as is evidenced with his dumping his shrapnel at the feet of Keren where they slept on the beach.  I suppose I was expecting an ending, where he decides not to die, but ends up defending Keren and his friends from his ""buddies"" who decide to ""activate"" his bomb for him remotely at 8:00.  Instead, we have him trying to go through with it (perhaps he knows he is doomed and is trying to lessen the consequences, but then why go to the marketplace, and why do we have Katz trying to talk him out of it?).  As I say, the ending doesn't make complete sense to me.  I'd appreciate any insight into what is going on in the ending.  In any case, I loved this film, and found it extremely heartwarming, apolitical, and very timeless.  I'd give it a watch if I were you.",1288742400,6,1330,4.345528455284553
3952362,4,B002MQM4FO,Great movie right up to the final minute -- all the plot elements pointed to a positive outcome -- what led the script writer to choose that sorry ending is anyone's guess -- I don't like my emotions to be toyed with and have enough on my plate already.  I watched this on Netflix and won't be buying the DVD.,1276041600,6,309,4.15
3952363,5,B002MQM4FO,"What motivates someone to be a suicide bomber? What makes someone want to strap an explosive vest to themselves and kill dozens of people who have done them no harm? Mostly, I think, it comes down to people doing what they honestly believe is the right thing to do. But what happens when a would-be suicide bomber's bomb fails to go off and he's left questioning his actions? That's where the heart of his movie, For My Father, lies.

The story centers around Tarek (Shredi Jabarin), a Palestinian man who has gotten caught up with a very bad crowd. They persuade him that blowing up himself and others is the best thing to do for his people. The fact that it seems to require several vague threats towards his family if he doesn't do it shows that Tarek is already quite conflicted, even before his bomb fails to go off.

In desperation after the failed detonation, he goes to a Jewish man who runs an electrical repair shop. He orders a new button and, in order to escape notice from the police, offers to repair the man's leaking roof in return. There begins a whole new life for him, where he gets to know the man and his wife and, perhaps more importantly, gets to know the beautiful girl who works across the street. But his old friends aren't so eager to let him go and make it clear that if he doesn't detonate the bomb, they will.

This is a very impressive film about a very dark subject and it doesn't shy away from showing both sides in Israeli/Arab conflict, making it clear that both have good points and both also are willing to behave badly. I find this especially poignant given that I'm writing this only a day after an unpleasant incident where Israelis bordered a cargo ship and killed some people.

The film is very well-written, very well-acted and expertly shot. It dragged a bit in a couple points, but nothing too severe and I found that it left me with a great deal to think about. That alone places is very high above most movies.

What makes someone be a suicide bomber? The answers are as plentiful as the people who do it, and ultimately none of the answers are very good.",1275350400,20,2102,4.435233160621761
3952364,5,B002MQM4FO,"""For my Father"" is an incredible story about a Palestinian man who, after a series of unfortunate events, falls in love with a 17 year-old Israeli girl.

The kick is, he would never have met her if his vest of explosives hadn't stalled while he was attempting to blow up a crowded marketplace, and he was forced to seek out an electrician to fix it.

The moral of the story is that, even in the most extreme cases of Israeli/Palestinian tenstion, there is still hope for people coming together.

It's a beautiful story, and I'm extremely glad that I took the time to watch it.",1274745600,,576,4.466666666666667
3952365,5,B002MQM4FO,"I was fortunate to see this film at a Film Festival almost a year ago. While I saw many outstanding films, this one stayed with me. It is skillfully directed, the actors are outstanding, and there is no obvious political agenda. We are shown both sides of the controversy and by the end of the movie, appreciate the tragedy that occurs while at the same time applauding the humanity. This movie gave me hope that humanity has a chance to ultimately win over politics and corruption.",1272412800,2,482,4.616279069767442
3952366,5,B002MQM4FO,"This film does not take sides and gives no easy answers.  The film also has all of the qualities that go into making a great movie. First, it has characters that you care about.  Second,it is filmed on location.  Third it is approximately 90 minutes in length. My feeling that once a movie is more than about 90 minutes, something could have been cut out. The Arab-Israeli fight for the same land is shown through a lens not often seen- the lives and feelings of ordinary people. The bottom line for me is that like the centuries old wars and violence in Ireland and Northern Ireland,the combatants have far more in common-a common passion for life and a common humanity, then those issues that divide them, and oftentimes are in my estimation a smokescreen for power grabs by ruthless and warlike individuals whose interests are served by unending bloodshed.
  Maybe I'm naive, but I hold out hope for the Middle east because of the Good Friday  Peace accords in Ireland in 1998-that 12 years later seem to be holding. Senator George Mitchell, in my estimation gets the credit, and my understanding of this is that Ireland the UK the USA, said to the 2w warring parties- the IRA and the UVF  ok - You- get 50 percent of the sewer system and YOU get 50 percent of the sewer system. You can fight and not cooperate if you like, but 100% of the toilets won't flush. You get 50 percent of the electrical grid and You get 50 % of the electrical grid. If you want your lights to turn on-you are forced to cooperate.  Etc with Post Office Parks, potholes, hospitals etc. Perfect? No. But so far the best thing for Ireland in 1000 years in my estimation. Would it work in the Middle east...??
  Lastly, Hili Yalon is so hot she almost sets the screen on fire. She is one  INCENDIARY actress. Richard Morgan",1266105600,5,1799,4.487730061349693
3952367,5,B002MQM4FO,"For My Father/Shabat Shalom Maradona (2008) is an absorbing and complex quest of unyielding emotion, choice, and discovery. Given the choice of regaining your father's honor and cementing your legacy or alienating your family for a person you just met that rekindles your spirit, which would you choose? What if the action for your father would hurt this other person, but not hurting the other person would result in your father's death? All the while your life is on the line! This is Terek (Shredi Jabarin), a young handsome caring man that has found himself in an impossible situation.

Terek arrives in Tel Aviv, Israel and goes to a crowded market where he closes his eyes and prays as he slightly pulls up his sleeve to expose a trigger. He is a Palestinian suicide bomber. Click, click, click - the trigger is broken. He briskly walks away and around a corner to call the mission planner who wants to activate the vest of explosives via a cell phone link but is convinced to wait for him to fix the device and properly use it.

Under the cover of a construction worker needing a new trigger for a nearby work site he visits an electrician named Katz (Shlomo Vishinsky). Katz does not have the part and orders it for delivery in two days. With reports of a terrorist crossing into Israel coming over the radio and police cars driving by, he offers to fix Katz' leaky roof in exchange for the part to keep himself hidden.

Across the street is Keren (Hili Yalon) who runs a small shop after being disowned from her family. They immediately hit it off when he goes over for coffee and we see his human side for the first time as his face lights up when talking to her. Terek has diner with Katz where he feels compassion and sorrow for him after hearing of his sons death. Later that night Terek comes to Karen's aid when she is being harassed by some men for how her life doesn't conform to societies expectations. Tarek is more alive than ever as their feelings continue flourish.

He is being shown life by the people he came to kill - he must decide what he is going to do.

9.5 out of 10 - This film dares to reveal the human side of both sides. There is no political message, no taking sides, and little history of the conflict in the region - it is a story of people. I was kept engaged as the characters interacted and the story unfolded all the way to the ending credits. Perceptually riveting! For My Father was directed by Dror Zahavi and written by Ido Dror and Jonatan Dror; Hebrew and Arabic with English subtitles.

3952411,5,B002MQM4FO,"FOR MY FATHER (Sof Shavua B'Tel Aviv) is a brilliant little film, a joint German/Israeli production that for once has the courage and wisdom to examine another vantage of a potential suicide bomber. Written by Ido Dror and Jonatan Dror and directed with great sensitivity by Dror Zahavi the story is a brave one, one that takes the viewer into the minds of those who live in Tel Aviv both as Israelis and as youths disillusioned by parental dominance and by the outsiders, or Palestinians.

The film opens with a trio of men driving across the border into Tel Aviv to transport one of them as a suicide bomber - the quietly reluctant and sensitive Tarek (Shredi Jabarin). When the bomb fails to explode, he's left stranded in Tel Aviv until he's able to fix the detonator. The fact that Tarek is unable to detonate the bomb and will fail his mission opens the possibility to get to know the young man behind the terrorist mask, an opportunity we have not been offered before. Tarek encounters a young 17-year-old girl Keren (Hili Yalon) who wears earrings and brightly colored hair and short skirts in defiance of her conservative family and is mocked and beaten by young Israeli men for being an outcast. Her only friend is an old disillusioned man Katz (Shlomo Vishinsky) who likewise owns a tacky street vendor booth across from Keren. Tarek encounters Keren, protects her form her assailants, and they develop a close bond - Keren's desire to go swimming with Tarek is rebuffed because Tarek is still carrying the defective suicide bomb device under his shirt. In this one brief weekend we see that both Tarek and Keren have virtues, flaws, and unexpected facets to their personalities. It is also important to note that they both face as much pressure and harassment from their own communities as they do from their counterparts on the other side of the political and cultural divide. And in keeping with the total honesty of the story the ending will surprise and stun the viewer.

The film is in Hebrew with English subtitles. The cinematography is excellent and the acting by the three principals as well as by the supporting cast is outstanding. This is a very important film, well deserving of all the honors it has received since it was first released in 2008. Grady Harp, June 21",1338681600,5,2291,4.739348370927318
3952412,5,B002MQM4FO,"A beautiful film, really something special. In exploring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the lens of a handful of characters over a weekend together in Tel Aviv, the film doesn't claim to offer simple answers to the problems inhabitants there face. But it does ask us to consider possibilities, to rethink what we know--or what we think we know--about the lives and motivations and choices of both Israelis and Palestinians, and to re-imagine different solutions...if it were possible to break out of the insular social/political/religious circles that limit both sides from moving forward and making progress in their relations...if it were possible to have the space to just simply be humans interacting. As it demonstrates the divisiveness not only between Jews and Arabs in Israel-Palestine but also very much within each group, the film explores the complexities and the many layers of unrest there without taking sides. And all of this around a lovely, poignant story of friendship and growth.

Some reviews I have read elsewhere have faulted the film for ""holes"" in the storyline and for straying from realism, but I think this film is not meant to be ""realistic"" in the sense of a documentary. It's not a docudrama. It wants us to suspend judgment for a moment to open ourselves to the world of possibilities that exist within the stalemate of conflict in Israel-Palestine. When we meet Tarek in the beginning of the film, he is locked into a belief, having nothing to do with religious doctrine and everything to do with his life as it has unfolded as a Palestinian from Tulkarem, that drives him to suicide bombing: ""Since I was born I couldn't even dream. And that won't change unless they are hurt."" Throughout the film his belief is challenged in unexpected, unanticipated ways. By the end of the film we are left with the sense that where there is hope, there is life, if it is only given a chance by both sides and enough time to flourish. A pipe dream perhaps, considering the circumstances, but one which the filmmakers want their audience to see is indeed possible.",1329436800,4,2092,4.926345609065156
3952413,5,B002MQM4FO,"Many Israeli films, such as this one, were made by Israelis seeking reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis, and peace. This film focuses on the lives of an Arab and an Israeli family and the troubles each suffers. The language of the film is Hebrew and Arabic, primarily the former, because most of the action occurs in Tel Aviv, but the subtitles in English are clear and easy to follow. Both the Israeli young woman, who for reasons that the film discloses is estranged from her father, but not her mother, and the young Arab, who is trying to protect his family, are very likable. The young woman is hounded by extremist Orthodox Jews and the Arab protects her.

The Arab, for reasons that become clear in the film, agrees to be a human bomb, a terrorist, who will enter the market in Tel Aviv when it is packed with people and blow himself and the Israelis up. But the bomb does not go off, and circumstances mandate that he stay in Tel Aviv for two days and ignite it later. During this time he gets to meet and appreciate some Israelis and especially the young woman.

Viewers will find it interesting to discover why he feels that he has to be a bomber, why the young woman is estranged from her father, can there be a relationship between Arabs and Israelis, how will the Arab's family react to what he does, and how will the Israelis he meets react .",1323648000,4,1362,4.444

3952415,5,B002MQM4FO,This wonderful film makes my heart so sad both for those who are under bondage to their hatred of others & those who are their victims.,1315958400,,135,4.230769230769231
3952416,4,B002MQM4FO,"""For My Father"" (original title: ""Shabat Shalom Maradona""; 96 min.) is another release in the on-going and excellent Film Movement series. The movie was originally released in 2008 but it took almost 2 years for it to find wider distribution into the US, to which I can only say ""better later than never"".

The movie brings 48 hrs in the life of Tarek, a would-be Palestine suicide bomber, who fails to detonate on a Friday morning in a busy open market in Tel Aviv due to a faulty electrical swith. (During the last minute pep-talk to Tarek by the masterminds behind the bombings, one of them says: ""Remember why you are doing this. If we had an air force, we wouldn't do this. You are our air force."" Chilling.) Tarek now must fix the switch that prevented the bomb from exploding and given that few people are out on the Sabbath, he must wait out the next 48 hrs. Not surprsingly, the would-be suicide bomber comes to notice that most of the Jewish people he intended to kill are just regular and innocent people, each with their own ordinary lives and problems. Tarek even strikes up a friendship/light romance with Keren, a beautiful Jewish woman, and also befriends an old Jewish guy who remains bitter over the death of his son in the Israeli army many years ago. Given that Tarek was blackmailed into becoming a suicide bomber, he has ever-growing doubts about what he intended to do. Then Sunday morning comes around...

I very much enjoyed this movie, as it showcases the human consequences and costs of the Israeli-Palestine conflict. Let me be clear: I strongly condemn and oppose any suicide-bombing, regardless from which side it comes. As directed by Dror Zahavi, lead actors Shredi Jabarin (as the would-be suicide bomber) and especially Hili Yalon (Keren) give outstanding performances. ""For My Father"" won 7 Israeli Academy Awards for good reason. In all, I can't say enough of this movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1295136000,9,1927,4.801204819277109

I like that the movie shows the complexities of what people living in the area call ""the situation.""",1290816000,,285,5.042553191489362
8373983,5,B002MQM4FO,"The mixing of love and hate, shame and pride, intimacy and trauma create a concoction which can not be sustained. Chapeau to the creators of this film, who dared touching on what sits at the heart of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. At times the film's plot moves suspensefully - minute by minute, in a way which is reminiscent of ""High - Noon"". At other times it presents with the quiet pathos of a Greek tragedy. Wherever you are politically - don't miss this film!",1499385600,,468,4.583333333333333

Not the kind of movie I wanted to see on a Sunday night, but definitely a must see.

Bombings can't be excused, Settlements are NOT the solution, a buffer zone MUST be created between the 2 countries. Jerusalem international city belongs to humanity!

8373987,5,B002MQM4FO,"He awakens and plaintively calls out to his mother, and when she responds, he doesn't say anything. How could he explain what he's about to do? Tarek (Shredi Jabarin) is then suited up with explosives and headed to a Tel Aviv market. When his first detonation attempt fails, he's thrust into the lives of his would-be victims, one, the beautiful endearing Keren (Hili Yalon). The story is intricate and moving. The characters are complex and multifaceted. The constant intensity and intrigue of the storyline, particularly in light of Tarek's never removing his concealed vest, caused me to pause the film several times, as I wanted and wanted not to know what happens next. The acting of the leads and the supportive cast is top-notch. This is a powerful heart-grabbing, mind-gripping piece, wisely conceived and executed. Definitely recommend.",1489190400,,845,5.175182481751825

I also question how many suicide bombers would be willing to act to act so friendly to their potential victims as they wait to commit  their crime.

Had Tarek wanted to get out of it all he had to do is immerse himself in the ocean by Tel Aviv. The water would have destroyed the bomb mechanism.",1483315200,2,457,4.416666666666667
