2519991,4,B000EHQU6C,"Good workout to focus on your lower body.  Billy really works your legs hard and will make you feel it for a couple days, so take it easy initially.  Overall, I enjoy other Boot Camp workouts better, as I like a good whole body workout.  But if you want to focus solely on the lower body, this is a great workout for you.",1247443200,2,321,4.063492063492063
2519992,4,B000EHQU6C,"I am satisfied with the time of shipping. It is another magical set of workouts that would help weight loss and a good shape if you stick with it. The only problem is that it works the best with Billy bands, but the bands are not included in the package, so you have to order them separately!!",1246147200,,293,4.157894736842105
2519993,5,B000EHQU6C,"I don't understand some of the negative comments on here.  I have over a dozen Billy videos and I feel this is one of the better ones.  Obvioulsy, this is a spot traning video.  Notice it's called ""lower body bootcamp.""  Work your upper body one day and then switch to lower body.  It gives the muscles time to recover if you alternate which ones you do everyday.  Billy focuses on a good warm-up in this one - almost 8 minutes and a few minutes of cool down at the end.  He uses the Billy Bands, but as with all his videos, you don't need them to still get a great workout.  I haven't been using them and still feel an awesome burn.  He always has one person demonstrating the moves without the bands, tough you can pretty much figure it out yourself.  You get some cardio in this workout too, which is great.  Besides that expect some squats, front kicks, back kicks, roundhouse kicks, lunges, and some floor moves that really work your butt!  He even does about 5 minutes of abs at the end.  He is quite motivational and fun throughout, as he is in all of his other videos.  It only takes one video to decide if you like Billy's style.  If it works, he's got the same attitude in all his videos.  If you don't like it, well... I have no suggestions.  I love Billy Blanks.  He's changed my life mentally and physically.  Good luck to all.",1243555200,20,1340,4.288
2519994,3,B000EHQU6C,"The first part of the dvd is an ad for Billy Blanks web site and the things he offers there.  You cannot fast forward of skip this, so you have to listen to it every time you run the dvd.  It's not long, but it really makes me mad that I don't have the option of skipping it.  By the way, be careful if you buy from Billy Blanks web site, read the privacy policy. His privacy policy made me decide not to buy from his web site.",1203638400,2,427,3.8295454545454546
2519995,2,B000EHQU6C,I really did not enjoy this as much as the cardio fat blaster and the fat blasting bootcamp...kind of boring,1202428800,2,108,4.45
2519996,3,B000EHQU6C,"This is a great workout, but it felt kind of short...like there should have been more than just one workout session on the dvd.  You'll need workout bands for this video for the full intensity, which I do not have.  Overall, I think there are better Billy workouts out there.",1192924800,3,275,4.48
2519997,4,B000EHQU6C,"I found this to be a very good work out. I tried using the bands, but they didn't really work for me, so I use leg and arm weights instead. they are a really good alternative to the resistance bands.

You can definetly feel the burn!

It is an isolation work out for lower body, but it definetly does work. I use this workout in conjunction with another Taebo workout.",1173916800,8,368,4.242857142857143
2519998,5,B000EHQU6C,"I have worked out for years, doing yoga, and pilates, and felt I was in good shape.  However, after having my 4th child at age 43, I lost the weight but did not regain my body as quickly as I did in the past.  I bought all the Billy Blanks dvds, and noticed a difference after just one week.  I am more toned, stronger, and have more energy now than in my 20's, and this workout has given me my body back!!  I am hooked on Tae Bo!!",1169337600,6,431,3.8636363636363638
2519999,5,B000EHQU6C,"What an amazing video.  I purchased the set that included this and Billy's other bootcamp videos and I love them!  This is an intense lower body workout that you will definitely be feeling the next day.  I have been working out for awhile, but nothing like this!  It is a great wokout and Billy definitely motivates you to do your best.  I have never been so excited to exercise!  It is a must have if you are concerned with your lower body.  I can already feel a change.",1140048000,26,471,4.284090909090909

2520012,5,B000EHQU6C,Billy Blanks is a great instructor and this is  a really good lower body workout.  I am not using the bands right now and it gives a burn! You get cardio in the mix and it is an energetic and fun workout.  You will sweat!  Highly recommend!,1376352000,,240,4.042553191489362
2520013,5,B000EHQU6C,"Stay committed and you will see results on this one. The bands are a little awkward, so I do without...still works.",1354320000,,115,4.523809523809524
2520014,5,B000EHQU6C,It's really tough but this is the best workout I've ever had.  I work out with this video 3 times a week.  Be ready for some sore muscles the first week.,1288483200,,153,3.903225806451613
2520015,5,B000EHQU6C,"Billy's Bootcamp workouts have a great focused exercise vib. He keeps you moving at a pretty good sweat level. Basically this workout has lots of kicks, anything that focuses on the legs... leg-lifts, hydrants etc. He varies things well so it doesn't feel repetitive. I do it with no Billy bands and it's still a great workout. I use weighted gloves to enhance my upper body workout.

I do it once a week in my rotation, and my legs and behind can feel it. I can see more definition after just using it for several weeks. I got this with the Bootcamp Abs and they are both great focused workouts for kicking it up a notch in those areas.

It's 45 minutes minus the minute or two intro. The music has a good beat. There are enough folks in the background so you can see some variation. Simply a great workout.",1287014400,2,808,4.344370860927152
2520016,5,B000EHQU6C,"I love working out to Billy Blanks Taebo. I have been working out with him for years. I have received this DVD today and workout to it. I found it to be a great lower body workout. I wasn't going to use my bands to do this exercise, because I didn't want to take them out of my other bootcamp DVDs box, but I did and I'm glad that I did. It make the workout more intense.

I can't wait to workout to the Cardio Bootcamp Live DVD.I have bought the 2 pack DVD set.",1280966400,,462,3.863157894736842
2520017,4,B000EHQU6C,"Product quality was excellent, my only issue was the time between the placement of the order and the time it was actually shipped.  The wait although within the timelines given was still too long.",1267660800,,196,4.764705882352941
2520018,5,B000EHQU6C,This is a great workout for the lower body...i have the entire boot camp. I would buy again. Get the entire camp series its great.,1256515200,,130,4.24
2520019,3,B000EHQU6C,I found the bands to be very awkward in many of the exercises (it's not the first time I've used them and I was still focusing on their position more than on my legs) and the entire video just didn't leave me feeling like I had just worked out my lower body for 45 minutes.  I think Billy's Amped Rockin' Buns was a much better workout (my legs still felt it 3 days later -- without the amplifier) and would recommend it to anyone who thought this video needed a little more burn.,1247961600,2,480,4.161290322580645
8109971,5,B000EHQU6C,"Billy Blanks is one of my favorite DVD fitness instructors.  He has great energy, and his workouts are accessible for the absolute beginner and can easily be modified to be more challenging so this DVD grows with you.

In addition to that if you love group fitness/bootcamp classes but can't afford them this DVD (and his others) will capture that experience.

If you don't have the bands you can easily modify these moves by adding handweights.",1501372800,,445,4.828947368421052
8109972,5,B000EHQU6C,I love Billy Blanks! All of his dvds have helped me to shape up when I use them that's why I still buy them! (Lost my others when I moved) he'll always have my support! When he speaks into the camera it motivates me like he's talking directly to me!,1489708800,,249,4.0

By the way, I'm 58 and although I can't move as quickly on the reps as they do on the video, I can hold my own.  If you're out of shape you best take it slowly as these workouts are tough.  Worth the effort and fun too.",1427328000,,312,3.9047619047619047
