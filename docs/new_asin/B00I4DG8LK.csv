I enjoyed the first two seasons, and I am about to view the third DVD. I have watched the original version of HOMELAND, and this series is as marvelous. Israeli film is extraordinary. Some of the films have the same actors, almost an ensemble, and it is unique that these actors are able to take in so many different roles. Why? Because it is a small nation with grit, and talent, and drive, and they should be honored for their diversity.

They are even able to depict the Arab population and afford them dignity.  The families in this series are a mixture of raucous and loud, and nuts.  They have issues that are sad, poignant and downright hilarious.
