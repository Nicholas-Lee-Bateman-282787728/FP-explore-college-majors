8319057,3,B001LNOLN2,"A stranded and dirty teenage girl is picked up along a desolate strip of highway by a traveling salesman. Being very straight-lace as defined by the times, he's at a loss as to how to react to (and protect himself from) the primal instincts of a lost, lonely little girl.

""The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie"" (1972) is one of my favorite creepy film of the '70s. Rosalie is the girl you, at times, feel sorry for and, at times, are just simply disgusted with. Bonnie Bedelia does a wonderful job of playing her with a very hard stubborn edge that can drive you crazy. Richard (Ken Howard) is very clean and white in comparison to a brown and dusty landscape filled with brown, dusty people. He stands out like a cultivated plant in a wild desert garden.

You will leave this movie feeling bewildered and frustrated. I think it is the kind of movie that deserves to be reevaluated.",1385942400,,879,4.522012578616352

8319059,3,B001LNOLN2,"The film itself is very well done, sadly Sinister's print is a cut version, most likely a TV print.  A shame as it's hard to find otherwise. Granted the film was rated PG to begin with, but sexual situations and dialog have been censored.  The old Media VHS was the complete PG rated US release version Fox distributed.  The film was recut slightly before relase to secure the PG, some nudity was removed / replaced, some overseas prints reflect this slightly stronger edit.",1308182400,8,474,4.686746987951807
