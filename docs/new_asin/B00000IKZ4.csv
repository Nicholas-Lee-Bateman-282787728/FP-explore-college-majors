7910815,5,B00000IKZ4,My son used to rent this movie over and over at the video store until it was so wore out they removed it from the shelf. He wanted it really bad and I was able to order it from Amazon. We received it quickly and it was in great shape. A nice addition to his dvd collection!,1367193600,,273,3.807017543859649
7910816,5,B00000IKZ4,"I am such a fan of Jim Varney's and watch everything he's been in. 'Treehouse Hostage' is a great family film. It is like the modern day version of 'The Boy who cried Wolf'. When you play pranks and make up wild stories all the time, don't expect people to believe you when you tell the truth. Case in point, Timmy has an overactive imagination which gets him into trouble with his parents, teachers, cops and the principal. So when escaped counterfeiter, Carl Banks, played by Varney, ends up in the boys'(Timmy, Stevie and Buddy's) security system of their tree house, no one believes him even when tells his dad and the police. Along the way, they befriend Carl, who turns out to actually be a really nice guy. This DVD gets regular use in my home. It's a clean movie that's kid friendly for all ages. Watch with your kids. It's funny and sometimes serious and definitely heartfelt, thanks to Varney's dramatic scene in the tree house when he was telling the boys how he got mixed up with counterfeiters. Varney's talents are sorely missed.",1348876800,3,1043,4.612903225806452
7910817,5,B00000IKZ4,I bought this for my son. He loves Jim Varney movies and came across this one per Amazon. You can not find this one in the stores. The order came just in time for Christmas.,1265328000,,173,3.9714285714285715
