781590,5,6304053614,"I am a fan of Science Fiction and I disagree with all the negative comments below. This story was never meant to be as heavy as 2001 or even Ground Hog Day. The actors are not preforming Shakespeare. They do a very good job in this light drama, perhaps more a kin to a tv movie. Helen Slater gives a very subtle and nuanced portrayal of a woman who is deeply lonely and yet still open to a man who sincerely cares about her. The story focuses on the characters and their interaction and does not spend an inordinate amount of time on explaining the cause of the time displacement. This is one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen because it is honest, simple, and done with care. I doesn't bother me that it obviously had a low budget. Besides, the whole thing essentially takes place on one floor of an office building.",1052524800,35,835,4.32484076433121
781591,1,6304053614,"Oh my god! This movie seriously needed first aid! The acting was... not convincing, to say the least. I suspect the producers smoked the budget. Unsalvageable in all respects, and a waste of space and time, oh the irony.",1050105600,2,220,4.666666666666667
781592,4,6304053614,"The movie is an interesting contrast to Groundhog Day.  The plot is roughly the same, with the same day repeating and only one man aware that it is happening.  One difference in 12:01 is that the story attempts to  explain the time loop with some dubious sci-fi mumbo-jumbo that would have  been better left out.  If you've seen any of the new Star Trek spinoffs  shows, you know the kind of mumbo-jumbo I'm talking about.  Another  difference is the protagonist is a young man, which imparts a slightly  different spin on the plot than Bill Murray's middle-aged, burnt-out  newsman in Groundhog Day.  In particular the younger character is more  motivated to rectify the problem than Murray's character, since the latter  hated his life.
This movie does not work as science fiction.  It is much  more interesting as a study in character, seeing how an ordinary young  adult would respond to this unique crisis in his life.  As such, it is  interesting, but Groundhog Day gave the theme a better treatment.
If you  liked 12:01 and Groundhog Day, I strongly recommend the novel Replay by Ken  Grimwood.  Same theme, except the main character repeats his LIFE.  In  Replay, the time-loop idea is fleshed out in a way that could never be done  in a movie.  Like Groundhog Day, Replay doesn't try to explain the loop,  which allows you to concentrate on the characters.  Highly recommended.",962323200,5,1386,4.811965811965812
781593,2,6304053614,"This film was just OK in my opinion. I strongly urge you to see the original 12:01. first filmed as a short in 1990, starring Kurtwood Smith who is perhaps best known for playing Clarence J. Boddicker in Robocop.  This version focuses on the tragic aspect of the idea, with Smith's  character (trapped in one hour! - not 1 day!) becoming more frustrated with  the situation as the story goes on. The most heartbreaking moment is when  he has explained to another character what is happening (and proven it by  predicting a few occurrences around them). She responds by trying to give  him comfort with an embrace. Both versions are based on a story by Richard  Lupoff. The 1990 short was nominated for an Oscar.",962236800,7,711,4.64

781595,5,6304053614,"This movie will have you thinking long after it's over. Before Dark City and The Matrix came along, this innovative film put you in the shoes of someone who's whole context challenges him to alter reality, fall in love,  and change who he has been being in his life to accomplish it. In the  proces, he learns more about what is going on in the world around him then  he ever would have.

  The main premise is what if a day were to repeat  itself and you were the only one outside the loop who knew it. All the  other people would forget everything when the day ended. Telling you this  doesn't ruin anything because the movie keeps the pace quick and throws in a  lot of variables for our hero to overcome while always keeping it interesting. This film also features a wonderful comic turn by Jeremy Piven way before his popular role on the entourage series.

This  film works on many levels. I am not surprised that the fellow admiring reviewers saw it so  many times. Like The Matrix it is a movie that rewards with several  viewings.",946080000,24,1038,4.394736842105263

The lead actor, though pretty much unknown, does a good job throughout, as do the others.  You'll see a few familiar faces from other films in minor roles too.

If caught in a similar situation, you would probably kick yourself if you did some of the things this guy does, and not everybody has a happy ending like Groundhog Day.  Yeah...the computers are dated, as are some of the other gizmos and stuff, but that pretty much doesn't matter, and just makes me homesick for the good old days before cell phones and fast computers and an interconnected everybody.

782034,5,6304053614,"12:01 will remind you in many ways of Groundhog Day, as the hero of the movie is living the same day over and over again. However, this movie was made years earlier, and the scope and tone of the movie are completely different. Where Groundhog Day provided Bill Murray's character with a unique chance at self-discovery and redemption, here our hero is trying to save the woman he's developed a crush on from being murdered, and find out why his day keeps repeating over and over again.

Jonathan Silverman is charming and funny in the role of a less than serious employee in a scientific firm's personnel department, who by chance is the only person who understands that the same day is repeating over and over again.

Jeremy Piven is seen before his increase in fame, and is also amusing as Silverman's practical joking friend.

Helen Slater is convincing as the beautiful and brainy scientist who Silverman must convince of both the existence of the ""time bounce"", and his feeling for her.

Martin Landau gives his usual strong performance as the head of the research which ultimately creates the time bounce.

As does Murray in Groundhog Day, Silverman tries various combinations of actions to make his day ""go right"", keeping notes as he does so. I think writers for both movies were inspired by video games: ""Hey, what if you could hit the reset button and live a day over and over again!""

I was so impressed with 12:01 when it originally aired that I carefully checked the TV listings each week hoping it would rerun. When it did I taped it. I was delighted a few years later to find it available on DVD and get a superior viewing format to my aging VHS tape.

At the time it aired it was a unique and very interesting story concept. The cast is great, and all give great performances. If you are a fan of any of these performers, or you like a little light Sci-fi with some comedy, then I recommend this film to you without reservation.",1293580800,5,1945,4.57183908045977

782037,3,6304053614,"12:01: 6 out of 10: As made for television sci-fi films go this is certainly one of the better ones. The sense of dj-vu one gets from watching it however, is not necessarily from the same day repeating plot device but instead from the invariable comparisons to Groundhog Day.

In my always humble opinion Groundhog Day is one of the best films of the nineties. It told an eternal truth which is that many of us simply repeat the same day over and over again without living any particular day to the max. 12:01 doesn't have that ability and as a result much of the film it simply goes through the motions.

12:01 stars Helen Slater and Jonathan Silverman. Both actors never quite reached the promise of their early careers but both are certainly competent here. Slater just doesn't quite have the charisma of say a Helen Hunt and Silverman just never quite reaches the comedy of say a Jerry Seinfeld. Nevertheless they are both quite likable in their respective roles.

The story is a more serious sci-fi affair complete with giant science machines and bad guys that wouldn't be out of place in a TJ Hooker episode. With a relatively appealing cast and some nice humor 12:01 makes for a decent timewaster. Just don't be surprised if you feel you have seen it all before.",1266278400,2,1269,4.606194690265487

If the plot about a loop in time seems amazingly like Groundhog Day, you'll be even more amazed to know that this story came first -- published in the early 70's. 12:01, however, is a good deal heavier on the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, with a little of The Office thrown in for good measure. The personnel manager is hatefully hysterical!

It's also fun to watch Martin Landau once again in a ""Mission Impossible"" kind of role.

782155,1,6304053614,"This is a TV movie that caught my attention because the Amazon summary describe it as science fiction, and most reviewers rated it as a good movie. Because I did not have it on my radar, I did search a bit and found out the film is based in the 1973 short story ""12:01 PM"" by Richard A. Lupoff, published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Considering the plot is about time repeating, just like the famous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day-Special-Edition/dp/B00005U8EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day (Special Edition)</a>, I decided to give a try and bought it for my Sci-Fi collection.

What a disappointment! The film is supposed to be science fiction because the time repeating effect is vaguely explained as a result of a quantum mechanics side effect of a secret project, but surprise, the science ends there. This film is actually a comedy, and not a very good one. The acting is mediocre and the script is dull.

At least Groundhog Day had a philosophical message about what we do with our lives, 12:01 has none. And given that any time repeating plot get tedious at some point, the film's message and Bill Murray performance allow you to endure until the end of the film. Never mind Groundhog Day never explains why time is bouncing.

Absolutely not recommended for science fiction fans, this is a film just for those who really like a light comedy and need to kill some time during the weekend.",1221523200,2,1483,5.094650205761317

This movie may not be steeped in SciFi, but I can name you many other movies that were excellent that used a SciFi premise and did not have many special effects or scientific jargon to bolster the story. Now when I caught a few minutes of this on TV when I hit the sack late last night I truly could tell from a few minutes of it that it was something I really wanted to see and if I wasn't so tired I would have seen all the last half. Jonathan Silverman I have always enjoyed in what few movies I have seen him in to date.

Everyone of course has seen ""Weekend at Bernie's"" since it is a riot. Silverman's role here is a bit more mature, but nonetheless he pulls off some great comedy just because his timing and delivery are flawless. Even though I have only seen a few minutes of this I am ordering it today. For this price there is no way I am passing up what I am sure is a great movie for such a low price. Once I see the whole thing I will add to this review. After seeing the whole movie, in a nutshell I saw that he was in a timeloop where a pretty girl he likes is shot dead. Each day he tries to figure out a way to stop it from happening without being carted off in a straight-jacket. If you enjoyed this, catch ""Timerider"".

They generally return it later and comment that the story was much better than they expected.

I believe that most people will have a similar reaction.  It has a good mix of humor, sci-fi, romance and drama to please everybody. It is also a good movie to have on-hand for group viewing because it is not a movie that everyone has already seen and it doesn't contain any language or situations that would be potentially embarassing.",1180483200,5,793,4.563380281690141

What the movie does do well is keep you entertained, with very little desire to look away for any length of time.  I must admit that while I am a bit of a movie snob, this one still makes my all time favorite list.  Despite it's shortcomings it happens to be a film that gets it right overall.  All of the parts come together to tell a great story enjoyably (if not beleivably), and you get a great sense of knowing the characters.

Jonathan Silverman stars as a young personnel worker who is caught in a time bounce, wherein he must relive the same day over and over again and prevent the murder of a young scientist whom he has fallen for.  Silverman's actions in the first half of the movie are out and out stupid, and no wonder everyone thinks he's nuts.  However, as he learns a better way to prove his wild story, he becomes more convincing.  The movie doesn't rely on special effects, and it's interesting to see how he manages to alter things and in doing so, we learn everything's not the way it seems.

782500,5,6304053614,"I can't really express in writing just how extremely happy I am that 12:01 is finally out on DVD. It's been on my wish list since the DVD format was invented. The only copy I had was on the VHS that I had recorded off the air (with commercials (:[) on FOX-TV in 1993 and watched over and over and over, not unlike Barry's day repeating. As others have noted, the always beautiful Helen (Supergirl) Slater positively glows in this film. In the lead role, Jonathan Silverman excels as the discouraged office worker who witnesses his only real love being murdered in broad daylight, then being given the chance to undo it, while being thwarted at every turn.

As a fan of all time-warp stories, I count this as my favorite. Had it been released in the theater, it would have done very well indeed. It is good for all ages to see the the lengths that the hero of the story goes to in his desperate attempt to save the lady that he loves from afar. Ten stars out of ten and two thumbs up from me.

I'm not a fan of scifi (despite all the Quantum Leap on my shelf), I hate time travel. But this movie -- I loved how the main character started off as a loser and just kept getting better every time the day repeated.

There aren't really a lot of movies I saw once and remembered forever. The last time I went looking for info on it, I saw it was out on DVD and actually bought it. I think it's the only movie I've ever bought that didn't have Scott Bakula in it. (I lie -- I also bought Crazy People. very funny and also a great love story).

""Groundhog Day"" is a nice comic rif in a similar vein, but this is a much more solid product.  Helen Slater is at her best in this movie - heartbreakingly beautiful, she gives a moving and unforgettable performance.  Martin Landau is chilling as the morally questionable scientist, and Jonathan Silverman is one of the most credible and likeable heroes in the history of the genre.

782503,5,6304053614,"As I recall (I only saw it the one time, 13 years ago), this is a gem of an adventure/romance/murder-mystery/hard-science scifi movie.  The cause of the day's repeating is ""plausible"", as is the hero's being exempt from the cluelessness everyone else experiences that the day is repeating, as are the motivations of all the principal characters.

  Silverman's character has an alarm clock that I'd love to have, ""Get up, lazy boy!""

  I had one very slight quibble at the end of the movie, that I felt was the director's mistake, but may have been the fault of some studio honcho.  The idea of the story is that the day ""bounces back"" as the result of an event.  I don't recall whether they explicitly invoked the image of a record (you remember vinyl LPs) skipping, but that is the idea I took away ... that there was a skip or bounce or jump.  At the end of the movie, there is, and they only did it the one time as I recall, a visual montage (is that redundundundant) of the day rewinding.  That was jarring to me, went against the idea of the bounce or skip or jump and didn't make hard-science sense.

Granted, it's old, and nobody's ever heard of it before, but I highly recommend it.  12:01 is funny yet dramatic at the same time, and you can't help but root for Barry the underdog.  He played nerdy Drew in the 1980s movie Girls Just Want to Have Fun (also a great movie), and I must say, he grew up nice!  Like a previous reviewer stated, 12:01 is kind of like Groundhog Day, but 12:01 is so, so, so much better!",1158364800,6,442,4.1647058823529415
782505,5,6304053614,"There's just something so cool about this movie's concept. Yes, it's very similar to Groundhog Day and also Ken Grimwood's novel Replay, yet 12:01 has its own identity. This film is sharp, funny, and romantic. It also throws a bone to the sci-fi fanatics. And, unlike Groundhog Day, 12:01 doesn't get mired in the muck of existentialism. I've only seen this once - I guess, 13 years ago - when it originally aired on television in 1993. But, it's stayed in my brain. I was very disappointed when I checked on this site months ago and realized that this dvd hasn't been put out yet. Well, the excellent news is that now, there is a release date: November 28, 2006. Believe me, I pre-ordered this sucker pronto.

Barry Thomas (Jonathan Silverman) is an office drone languishing in his stuck-in-a-rut job while crushing on this beautiful, brainy research scientist Lisa, who is seemingly way out of his league.  A typical humdrum day at work ensues and ends; then, shockingly, Barry witnesses Lisa brutally get shot down to death. Overwrought, he goes to a bar and drinks. Later that night, a storm causes a lamp to shock Barry, exactly at 12:01AM. He wakes up the next morning to find that he's been caught in a time loop, where the same day keeps repeating. Now, armed with certain knowledge of predetermined events, Barry attempts to prevent Lisa's death and escape the time trap.

Jonathan Silverman stood out in my mind as being particularly charming in a lovable loser role. He carried this film. Throughout 12:01, I cheered for him to get things right, save the girl and win her heart. Helen Slater was very sweet here, her performance nicely meshing with Silverman's to create a nice, easy chemistry. We also got to see co-stars Jeremy Piven and Martin Landau.

This was a fast-paced, unassuming but vastly entertaining, little film which contained, at the heart of it all, a sweet romantic storyline, while also serving as a competent thriller. But the giddy sci-fi premise is, undoubtedly, what made it so captivating in people's eyes. The fact that this dvd is being touted as a ""special edition"" makes me hope that it would come with some decent special features. Let's hope.",1158192000,62,2184,4.800531914893617

782507,5,6304053614,"12:01 was originally based on Richard Lupoff's short story 12:01pm, he wrote the story around 1972-73 it was published in Dec 1973's edition of Fantasy & Science Fiction.

In 1989 a 30 minute film was made by director Jonathan Heap.

In 1993 the 12:01 movie was made with Helen Slater and Jonathan Silverman.

Then Hollywood got a hold of the movie and did a remake, I never found out what they called the movie but Richard Lupoff basically called them a pack of hollywood thieves.

I thought at first it was Groundhog Day but Lupoff states they changed the name but not the story so it couldn't of been Groundhog Day as the story was so different. So if anyone knows what the Hollywood release was called please tell, as Lupoff doesn't state in his book what they named it.

To read the short story you'll have to buy the book by Richard Lupoff called Before...12:01...and after. There are 23 short stories in the book 12:01pm being one of them.

Anyway, I think this movie is great, some may say its cheesy but hey I like cheese sometimes. I like Helen Slater and Jonathan Silverman I think they work well together in this movie. Plus i've always been interested in anything that involves time changes, like time travel, parallel universes etc.

It does make me think what I would actually do if I got stuck in a day that was repeating, I would only hope it wasn't a work day..lol

I have a copy on VHS but I wish they would release the DVD. It was a dissapointment to find them advertise a release date then the day of its release say it was not available.",1150329600,15,1559,4.426573426573427

The only thing was it had Thai subtitles, but that didn't interfere with my enjoyment of this timeless (pardon the pun) classic.  Still, I feel this movie should be released on DVD in this country as I found this as entertaining now as the first time I saw it on television.  And if it is ever released on DVD here, it should also include the Showtime Short ""12:01"" that inspired this movie.  That would make a great bonus feature.

The main character, Barry Thomas, is such a quirky funny guy that he provides a sort of narrative to the story. His jokes and comments with and to the other characters are excellently timed and played out. The casting is brilliant. Minor characters perfectly play their parts without seeking too much limelight, meanwhile adding to the humour. The film would be nothing without the quiet talent that is content to slip from shot and return the focus to the two main characters. This is a romantic comedy, science-fiction, fantasy, action, thriller, crime film.

Pre dates Groundhog day and is vastly superior in terms of the details in the recurring storyline and gradual - and clever -  unfolding of the events that caused the blip.
Shame that the plot is not so good regarding the DVD - maybe it fell back into an irretrievable time slip? Perhaps that is what makes it a 'Special Edition'?
Please, whoever you are don't give us false hopes at the eleventh hour! Do us all a favour and release the DVD before the 12:01 deadline....

I have been looking regularly for (and forward to) a DVD release of 12:01, and am very delighted that this very superior ""small production"" is finally being given the DVD treatment that it rightly deserves.

12:01 is both funny, suspenseful and romantic - a rare quality, and seldomly succesful when deliberately aimed for. But here, the entire movie, from script and production to direction and acting, is well made and highly original, playing on all sides of the story's aspects and the audience's feelings with flawless and tastefully good timing.

12:01 deals with a time paradox, and is one of the best sci-fi movies based on a time theme, that I ever saw... But it can also be seen by people without any preference for sci-fi, simply as a kind of family film.

A TV production, 12:01 was overshadowed by the box office comedy, Groundhog Day, which has a very similar time paradox theme. This was sad, since 12:01 is by no means a cheap imitation of Groundhog Day.

If you are in doubt as to whether this is really an overlooked gem, take a further a look at IMDB.com where people who saw this movie also find it brilliant and sadly overlooked.",1138233600,9,1301,4.570815450643777

The twist is that a super expensive particle beam is illegally being fired (which is causing the repeated day) and the main character must stop the culprit with the help of his new romantic interest.
