8388159,2,B00342AO3O,"Very interesting opera.  The ballet scenes have very good melodies, that is why I bought it.
However, the production is from the 1970s or 1980s.  The optics is worse than pre-HD, probably 480 pixels across.  Horrible.
One cannot see anything in some detail unless it is a very close-up shot.
Russia should redo it in a modern HD production.",1442188800,,340,4.728813559322034
8388160,5,B00342AO3O,"There aren't too many recordings (videos) of Borodins Prince Igor.  This 1981 Bolshoi production performed in the concert hall of The Kremlin is by far the best available, despite the more historical picture and mono sound.
First, the production itself.  This is a very classic period production, with utterly authentic costumes and aptly dramatic sets.  There are even horses on stage.  The depiction of the Don Cossacks Khan Konchak and his tribe is colourful and historically informed in one. Needless to say, the scene of the Polovtsian Dances is spectacularly presented with great choregraphy and terrific dancing, in the league of the Spartacus of Bolshoi, no less.
Then we have the opera itself.  Borodin did not complete this work, and other composers, notably Rimsky-Karsakov, gave the final touch to this 3-Act work with a Prologue.  It remains a bit strange, though, that the titular hero Prince Igor has in fact relatively little to sing  the bulk of the opera was shared by Prince Galitsky (Act 1), Konchakovna and Igors son Vladimir (Act 2), and in the final Act 3, we do not even have any more solo aria by Prince Igor.  This raises the question of what actually did Borodin wrote?  As there has been an assertion that in completing the work, over 1800 bars of original scores music was abandoned. In this Bolshoi production, only 3 Acts are given (the extra third Act depicting the escape of Igor and the conflict of Vladimir of leaving or staying with Konchakovna is omitted.  So we have less to see and hear from Prince Igor, which is of course regrettable.
As for the performances, truly there cannot be a better cast than this.  Evgeny Nesterenko, who started to sing in the West in the 1980s, is a real tour-de-force in the title role  his velvety and plangent lyrical bass a perfect instrument for this heroic and regal character, and Nesterenko has just that demeanour and stage presence to bring the role alive.  As Igors wife Yaroslavna, and who has the most to sing in this production, we have the wonderful soprano Elena Kurovskaya, owning a luscious and expressive voice with good employment in the different parts of the opera to carry the drama through.  Just as Nesterenbko, Kurovskaya is a beautiful and elegant figure, and acts as well as Nesterenko: a perfect match. The First Act is dominated by Vedernikov's Prince Galitsky, as well as the two bards Skula and Yeroshka.  The highpoint of the opera is in the Second Act, introducing Konchak and his daughter Konchakovna, sung and acted superbly by the Russian contralto
Tamara Sinyavskaya's.  Her lover, Igors son Vladmir, is sung by tenor Sherbakov, who gives an adequate but not particularly memorable portrayal, given that the following Act about the escape of Igor and his men is being cut in this production.  The portrayal of the Khan by another Russian bass Boris Morosov is fantastic  that this character can offer a parallel dominance as Igor both dramatically and vocally is the requisite, and Morosov proves an ideal match for Nesterenkos Igor in every sense. Their scene and duet in this Act forms the highpoint of this opera. This Act is rounded off with the spectacular dance of the Polvtsians, and small wonder the audience went wild after this.
The final Act see the glorious return of Igor (without his son, who stayed and married Konchakovna) in a most happy ending.  The feeling is that one simply does not wish the performance to end so early.
It is a clear case of terrific performance recorded, and even if the picture is not sharp enough by modern standards, the sound is a very good mono, and really one would not find fault with such minor quibble.
Unreservedly recommended.",1391558400,8,3684,4.84688995215311
8388161,4,B00342AO3O,"The bad part of this production is not the performance itself but the quality of the reproduction, sooo sad. Lucky enough, I have a 'Sharp' TY. It permits me to enhance the picture quality so that I could see the stage and the backgrounds.
The good part is the performance of all actors vocally etc. If you an opera buff, like I am, this is a must, despite.",1350000000,8,357,4.264705882352941
8388162,4,B00342AO3O,"Dated 1981, this dvd is obviously from a taping of live performance that I saw while visiting Moscow for a college semester that year. Prince Igor was already one of my favorite operas, and I was in opera paradise when I had the opportunity to see it performed not once but three times in Moscow. If this is the actual live performance, and not a taping based on the production, bear in mind that this performance is on the stage of the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, because the Bolshoi Theater was undergoing some work at the time (although I also had a chance to see some operas at the Bolshoi during that time, too). This production might have been a revival of the work after some absence from the repertoire or a welcome home to the star bass, and Nesterenko took the title role on opening night. There were also cameras ranged around the auditorium, maybe for TV viewing as well as for taping what appears on this dvd. When Nesterenko made his first appearance that night, the audience erupted in applause, and the show seemed as much about Prince Yevgeniy as about Prince Igor! The applause was not for nothing, though -- Nesterenko proved a colorful Igor that night. I also recall vividly Vedernikov's delicious portrayal of opportunistic Prince Galitsky (note reference to bad boy in the other review here), and the Skula and Yeroshka (the two gusli players who provide comic relief) in this production were also excellent. (I think the two singers in those roles made a career of them, as they also appeared in them in separate vinyl LP set of the opera by Bolshoi forces, also with Ermler conducting).

I note that on subsequent nights, other singers took the title role. The cameras were gone from the auditorium, and it seemed to me that parts of the Polovetsian Dances were done with more risque touches than on the night when the performance probably was appearing on TV.

I hope the colorful costumes, sets and effects (the eclipse; nightfall during the patrol and following love song in the Polovetsian camp; the burning of the walls of Putivl during the attack by Gzak) come through well on the dvd in spite of picture quality described in the other review here. Delighted to find this souvenir of my own memories of opera in Moscow, I have added the dvd to my cart without hesitation. I hope my review based on memories of seeing the production helps in spite of my not seeing this dvd yet.",1338508800,11,2409,4.639344262295082
8388163,5,B00342AO3O,"VAI, that wonderful rescuer of older, forgotten, lesser known classical music videos, has come through with a winner, albeit with some caveats for the techno minded. First, the warnings: the color picture on this 1981 Bolshoi performance is not very good, lacking sharpness, somewhat dark in places and replete with microphone stands on stage (although the latter did not bother me).

Now the good news. This is one terrific performance, wonderfully sung, well acted, superbly directed by Oleg Moralev, with fine camera placement (in spite of the picture quality) and dramatic and idiomatic conducting from Mark Ermler.

All the major singers are very fine, led by the legendary Evgeny Nesterenko's Prince Igor, a commanding, vocally rich portrayal, noble, unaffected and very powerful. Kultur has very fine DVDS of Nesterenko starring in Boris Godunov (twice), Khovanshchina and Glinka's A Life for the Tsar, all desirable.

Prince Galitsky is sung with confidence and relish by Alexander Vedernikov, obviously enjoying his bad boy status in the opera. The two major female roles are also very well done. Yaroslavna is sung with a touching sincerity and innocence by Elena Kurovskaya, and Tamara Sinyavskaya's Konchakovna has a characterful, winning allure, and both are solid vocally. Boris Morosov enjoys himself as Konchak, and his interactions with Prince Igor are most moving. Only the rather small role of Vladimir, sung by Vladimir Sherbakov, is somewhat penny-plain, without a great deal of allure. The choir and dancers are predictably distinguished.

Mark Ermler was one of the most respected Russian conductors of opera and ballet (he died in 2002), and his Prince Igor is thoroughly idiomatic, with flowing tempos, poignancy and authority. The drama is rich and spontaneous, and the famous Polovtsian Dances are masterfully done. The sound is mono, but good, full-bodied mono, with the voices very clear and suitably ahead of the orchestra.

The only current competitor on DVD is the 1998 Kirov under Gergiev, much better photographed but otherwise totally outclassed. Gergiev is not nearly as idiomatic, colorful and dramatic. His Prince Igor, Nikolai Putilin, is plain and undistinguished, especially next to Nesterenko. Galina Gorchakova's Yaroslavna is nicely sung but without the sincerity and nobility of Kurovskaya. Olga Borodina has too much of the diva in her for Konchakovna (Sinyavskaya has real charisma and is not a prima donna). Only tenor Yevgeny Akimov bests Ermler's Sherbakov, having more allure and a sweeter voice.

In spite of the picture quality and microphone stand placement, Ermler's performance keeps me riveted. Gergiev and his singers do not command nearly as much and the tableau-centered aspects of the opera seems to come to the fore, lacking dramatic impetus.

The Bolshoi is a treasurable performance, not to be missed.",1311033600,21,2865,5.381696428571429
