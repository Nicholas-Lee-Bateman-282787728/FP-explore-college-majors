323948,4,6301247345,"Platoon Leader is not what I expected from Cannon Pictures, masters of the career ending, guilty pleasure b-grade formula film.  It is less a formula war movie than the story of how an idealistic and by the book lieutenant (Michael Dudikoff) becomes a leader of men after getting a severe dose of reality training in the (...) quagmire of the Vietnam War.  What makes this really refreshing is how favorably the lead characters are presented as Lyons's old timer encourages Dudikoff's character to strengthen and maintain a firm grip on the beliefs that who they are, what they stand for, and why they are there are right and just.  Hope and idealism winning out in what one would think would be yet another in the then endless parade of Vietnam War angst movies.  Recommended.",1007510400,23,777,4.776119402985074

It is very accurate insofar as it describe the sheer moments of terror sometimes punctuated by various lengths of boredom!  The line troops absorbed a lot of casualties sequestered for years away from the public in Nursing facilities and VA Hospitals.  Many were so young in years when they got home after living with what they did and experienced, that readjustment was difficult for many.  Draftees right out of H.S. with the average age in the Nam being 19, from stats released after it ended; they never had a chance to figure out what they wanted to do with  their lives.  Many picked up addictions including drugs, alcohol, sex, and picked up STD's and other diseases including trench foot, jungle rot and Agent Orange and other chemical toxins, that they now know affected theim in a myriad of ways including mental and emotional fall-out.

324259,4,6301247345,"I would give this movie a 5* review with the exception of the occasionally over-the-top acting.  Had it just been middle of the road throughout, even that would have qualified.  It didn't play out that way.

Aaron Norris, Chuck's youngest brother, directed this Vietnam war flick.  He gives it authenticity owing to his own time in Vietnam.  The chatter between soldiers, the guns, the digs, even the swagger are all authentic.  Ask anyone who was there.

The biggest problem with this movie was that it WAS realistic.  This wasn't a made for TV movie nor was it a bazillion dollar budget movie. Oliver Stone's Platoon had hit big.  Apocalypse Now was still fresh in the minds of movie goers.  These movies probably spent more on advertising afterwards than Norris has to work with in the first place.

Platoon Leader, originally entitled Nam, is the story of a cherry (new guy) LT joining up with a platoon in the field.  The previous CO had spent the last two months of his time in his bunker trying to stay alive.  The old timers (remember, the tour of duty in Vietnam was one year) wouldn't give the man the time of day until he would eventually prove himself or for trying.

This isn't necessarily the story of the bond soldiers make but it does share the feeling.  This is mostly about the futileness of the whole thing.  The platoon had been charged with protecting a neighboring village who had not succumbed to the VC or NVA.  Eventually something's got to give from one side or another.",1425772800,8,1496,4.6273764258555135
324260,5,6301247345,"Platoon Leader, 1988 film

This is a story about the Vietnam War. A young First Lieutenant, a recent graduate of West Point, arrives to practice his profession. We see their activities in the field. A tunnel is found, there is shooting! An enemy falls out of a tree. One pit has a poisonous snake! A snare sets off a bomb to wound a soldier. Lt. Knight recovers in a hospital. Sandbags and concertina barbed wire form a barrier around their base. Reports predict an attack by a larger force. Then there is a body on a trail; an accused collaborator with the Americans. Later grenades are thrown at enemy soldiers by a waterfall; the water is not longer clear. Move out. Incoming artillery!

There is an ambush, men are wounded or dead. A woman and a child are there [for drama]. There is more shooting. The Lieutenant wants/needs more men as replacements. He meets them. Soldiers clear mines from a trail. One soldier lags behind, then is found relaxed. The enemy got him. At night an enemy infiltrates their base. Flares illuminate the night, they see more enemy creeping on the ground. Shooting explodes, so does a claymore mine to stop the enemy attack. They put a ladder over the concertina barbed wire! Helicopters arrive to attack the enemy, they retreat. The dead enemy are counted. Soldiers get people to change their minds, or they shoot.

Their plan is to attack the VC before they attack. The Lieutenant has his plan to stop the attack, it is adopted. The next day they move out. But there is a problem! They are attacked in the jungle. The VC are headed for the village. The wounded man is put on a Medevc helicopter. The villagers flee from the VC (they are defenseless), some are killed. The village is hit by artillery fire. I thought it was us they were after. They are rebuilding the village now. Later Mac returns. Welcome to the country club.

This movie is based on factual events but its events are fictionalized. It provides an example of combat that you won't see in the old WW II movies. Is it subtly anti-war? Some say war is about loot, either to get it or to keep it. Si vis pacem parabellum said the Romans, who conquered western Europe and the Near East. We still use the Latin alphabet, Latin words are used for medical terms.",1424131200,,2256,4.5492610837438425

So why is this not on DVD after all these years? I have 2 copies on VHS, one copy totaly worn out and the other is just hangin in there. I have been waiting nearly 25 years for whoever holds the rights to this movie to place it on DVD!

I've also noticed that Amazon has taken away the 'Do You Want It On DVD' function they used to have..... come on get the lead out.... a must have !

Where to start is quite difficult for me.  So basically for all you cats wondering why this crap is only on vhs here is the basic reason why.  I'll be so bold as to blame the director for all the bad acting.  Heck I'll even blame him for the inaccurate equipment as well.  I understand most people don't know right or wrong when it comes to equipment but all that crap aside I just plain out felt a little bit dumber after I suffered through this movie.  I know pretty much everyone has watched a movie like that.  It's kinda like when your wife makes you cuddle and watch a movie on the lifetime network on one of those special nights.  It's just plain wrong feeling.  I mean cmon you may as well be watching ""What Women Want.""  At least Mel Gibson can pull off a not so horrible war movie.  To be totally honest the twenty minutes of film in ""Forrest Gump"" are just about as accurate as you're going to get.  It's just as simply put as that.

This film actually goes some way to realistically portray a U.S platoon, where as many films just centre on a crazy one man killing machine. The characters actually are shown to vulnerable, even the hero of the Story. The only thing that lets this film down in my eyes is the obvious shoe string budget and also a few innacuracies. The budget limitations saw them use a crude mock up of an M79 Grenade Launcher and also contrary to what someone else put a very poor helicoptor assault scene that looks like something straight out of Thunderbirds. Also the soldiers were using 30 round magazines (which only ever appeared at the end of the war and were not issued to standard US army troops) instead of 20 round ones. Its only a small point but I'd have thought thats why they employed a military advisor, to make sure things like this were correct.",1098316800,8,995,4.533333333333333
