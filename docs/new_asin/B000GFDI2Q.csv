8131376,5,B000GFDI2Q,DVD came shrink-wrapped and works perfectly.,1505692800,,44,6.5
8131377,1,B000GFDI2Q,Keep the coffee hot to keep you awake as Dick Person and his female side kick go through basic camping items and some things to do if in need. Boring and not very helpfull to anyone who doesnt live either in Alaska or Canada. I think i will donate this dvd to a local charity bin.,1402358400,,280,4.017857142857143
8131378,5,B000GFDI2Q,This is a great video for a novice camper or woodsman or someone experienced who would enjoy a different perspective. Mr Persons is a great instructor and teacher more old school if you catch my drift but probably forgot more than I will be able to learn lol,1393804800,,258,4.395833333333333
8131379,2,B000GFDI2Q,"I have actually purchased this video twice from 2 different sellers, with the exact same defect to each DVD.  The audio does not work on many of the segments presented.

While there are other very good DVD's along these lines available I have yet to find one that is all inclusive.  One may have very good aspects say for finding direction and camp site selection but be weak on fire starting or survival plant ID and so on.  So it seems necessary to buy several different DVD's with much repetition and, sometimes, contradiction in order to have a complete library.  This one would seem to ad something to a collection if it worked.

Would I recommend it, well, it MAY add something and be a good purchase bought cheap, BUT ..............MAKE SURE YOURS WORKS.  Apparently, they must have had a bad run on these DVD's.  Check yours out if you buy.  Mine plays with audio UNTIL it gets to the section ""SKILLS"" which is divided into several chapters of which a couple do have audio.  I do not know if the chapter advance function works, I did not try it.  I used FF to stop during each chapter to see if the sound was available in at least part of the bad chapters.  It was not.

By the way, the young lady in the DVD playing the student is a bit annoying at times, but I guess they were trying to lighten a subject some might consider dull, and she isn't as bad as some make her sound.  This is a judgement from the sections I did have audio so this assumes that her oratory is consistent.  Since someone used the analogy of a First Grade Teacher (accurately), she deserves more than the an ""E"" for Effort implied by many reviews.

I bought it cheap so if they don't send me a return shipping label I'm not going to spend another $3 to send it back so I'll eat it, but BE WARNED, yours may not function 100%.  Open it up and check each segment even if you can't watch it end to end.  By segmentI mean not just the Topics listed on the main menu, but each individual subject addressed, I didn't count so I can't say there are actually 50.  I also noticed on some that the audio did not work the video was black & white, but then some were full color.  Each will either have sound or not if they are like mine.

Picture quality is SD.  Also, at the end and throughout (at least in the places I had audio)  there are the normal pitches for the sponsor manufacturers items, like knives, backpacks and so on.

Anyway, I hope yours works.  I MAY try 1 more time, but I will request the seller to test the item.  I doubt he will, but.....",1384473600,,2531,4.253668763102725
8131380,4,B000GFDI2Q,"Good video to watch with some good details on the title subject, would recommend this video, priced right for the material in this DVD.",1373155200,,135,4.666666666666667
8131381,2,B000GFDI2Q,"This was an informative video that educated me to some degree.

But 1 HUGE PROBLEM with it:  A big distraction named Laura Zealand, she's EXTREMELY annoying in this video! I can't stress this enough.

Here's somethings that i'd rather do than to hear her voice or see her completely ridiculous acting:

hear chalkboard scratching for the rest of my life
go to an ABBA concert
Live through another presidential term by George W. Bush
Drown at sea
Burn alive
Go deaf and blind
Eat fecal matter
get run over by a tractor trailer
Debate on abortion
Live with roaches
Have an illegitimate child with a prostitute

Do you see where I am going with this?

This video would have been great without her, or just let her play dumb and act like she's being taught something.  But every time she opens her mouth it makes me cringe.

Please tell me she didn't get paid well for this, uggghhhhh

8131382,1,B000GFDI2Q,"The problem with this was that it wasn't able to catch the viewer's attention...the presentation was a bit too hokey and caused me to constantly pause and go get a tea, make a sandwich, etcetera. The basic information is in it, but I do not feel the viewer will seriously digest the information. I cannot recommend this DVD at the market price.
Anyone can make a video, but the presentation is the key. I feel that anyone, beginner to professional, will learn more from Ron Hood's Survival Basics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survival-Basics-1-2/dp/B0001JXP5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survival Basics 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;for a lower price.",1283644800,2,682,5.969387755102041
8131383,3,B000GFDI2Q,"This DVD offers a number of good tips, but the presentation is a bit lame.  The approach of the female presenter reminds me of a first grade teacher and the man looks as if he was dressed by someone from a 1930s Hollywood studio. Even so, there is some good basic information to be had. It would be a good starting point for someone who has no outdoor experience and intends to do further study, but those with even a modest level of hiking/camping experience will want to look elsewhere.  For those needing something more, the DVDs from Ron Hood are an excellent place to find well presented, useful survival information.",1189987200,15,622,4.594594594594595
8131384,3,B000GFDI2Q,"I recently purchased this DVD, and although it has good information for the beginning to intermediate backpacker, I don't know that I would qualify this is as a hardcore survival DVD.

At times, the lady hosting this DVD comes off as a bit homerish.  There is one scene where they are discussing the use of various cords, and she states that she knows of one other use for cords, at which point the camera pans on over to Dick Person, and he says ""what's up?""  The scene then shifts over to the lady, who is now using a cord to hang up several lingerie items.  The whole scene was very corny and kind of underlines the mood for the whole DVD.

Don't get me wrong, there are some decent tips in this DVD, but I think the name, ""50 Outdoor Skills,"" is inappropriate for the content.  I think the title of, ""50 Great Backpacking Tips,"" would have been much more appropriate.",1161820800,19,871,4.37888198757764
