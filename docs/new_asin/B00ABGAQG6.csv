5408994,5,B00ABGAQG6,"This is the forth and final TV film following the progress of the special  police unit run by tough detective Cieran Hinds.  He has his usual staff working with him but is suspicious of them all, because someone has reported the mix up that was the result of episode three. Something he has tried to hide. So as he and his team work on the murder of a young actress, he is also trying to.find out who has betrayed him.  Because of the betrayal, he has lost the promotion he desperately wanted.

The story is full of the usual plot twists and turns.  I do like Lynda La Plante`s TV work.  She is a master of the crime genre.  At the end of the film, there are interviews with actors and guest stars from the programme.  Most interesting.

I got such a surprise at the very end of the film that I thought I might have mis-understood.  I re-played it and once again La Plante has managed to give us her trade mark shock.  Great TV and story telling.",1393804800,,946,4.229050279329609
5408995,2,B00ABGAQG6,This dvd is a region 2 and cannot be viewed in the US. It was not advertised  as a region 2 and I will not purchase any dvds from  this company,1388880000,7,143,3.5806451612903225
5408996,1,B00ABGAQG6,"Because It was not advertised only for Europe (PAL) and not usable in the US. I wasted my money. I loved the video which I had seen on Acorn, but I wanted to own it. It was not what I hope and was not described correctly I believe.",1386806400,14,231,3.8333333333333335
5408997,5,B00ABGAQG6,"I love this series.  Although it may be available on Netflix or whatever server you use, it often does not have closed captions as part of the format.  I definitely need CC to understand all the ""British"" accents, especially the Irish and the Scots.

Interesting story lines especially well acted.",1386374400,2,297,4.9
5408998,5,B00ABGAQG6,"This was as enjoyable as the previous three. The ending was provocative. In all the other series, the words ""above suspicion"" were stated somewhere in the script. I didn't notice them in this one. Was it because the person who Langton thought was ""above suspicion"" turned out to be the one who ultimately betrayed him? DI Anna Travis showed her hard side here, reminiscent of her forbear Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect. I have read this series might go on when/if Kelly Reilly becomes available again. THAT should be interesting ...",1382918400,4,532,4.857142857142857
5408999,5,B00ABGAQG6,The crimes are as grisly as they come and the police work is as seemingly frustrating as in the US. The characters come off as amazingly real; they're complicated and guarded and at the same time forthright and honest. This is a series that requires intelligent attention. A lot of back story is revealed via subtle conversational reference which explains much of the character interaction. I love it and find myself re-watching the series often.,1376352000,,446,4.96

5409001,5,B00ABGAQG6,I have greatly enjoyed this series with the two headliners playing well off each other. This seems to be the last but it leaves yu wanting more as the politics of British police make and break all.,1372636800,,197,4.351351351351352
