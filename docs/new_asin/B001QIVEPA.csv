3765096,2,B001QIVEPA,"I bought this hoping for a really great workout, and was very disappointed. It's very ballet-like and non-impact, so I'm sure there is a subset of people out there who will love it. If you want to really sweat-then no. It does offer a lighter change of pace if you normally do more intense workouts. Still, it just felt lame. The most annoying thing was the video was so distorted, it made the chic look 8 feet tall and about 50 pounds. That was a little disturbing, like exercise from another dimension?",1252368000,5,504,4.489130434782608
3765097,4,B001QIVEPA,"Great and simple workout! I loved how quick and effective the 20 minute workout was. The instructor is bubbly and easy to follow. I really like the 10 minute body area specific workouts too. They included new and easy exercises that I hadn't done before. And one of my favorite things about this workout dvd is that you don't need alot of space to do the workouts, and you don't need a ton of equipement either. Just some hand weights! The simpler, the better for me!",1248998400,,467,4.441860465116279
3765098,3,B001QIVEPA,"First off, let me say that I loathe workouts that aren't done in time to the music; either don't play music, or keep up with it, because in the first exercise here, the leg lifts are done with increasing and then decreasing speeds and then increasing again ... it is taxing on the leg muscles, although that could also be because there was NO WARMUP!!!!!!!!!  A few shoulder presses and that's practically it.  I mean, for a supposed cardio workout, you need to warm up.
Having said that, the instructor is friendly, encouraging and cues well.  I like the fact that there are variations for different fitness levels and I like the 10 minute routines at the end too - although when I played the arm workout, she goes into planks for abs ... Go figure.
Anyway, this workout is good for intermediates and the instructor is likeable and they use a nice set and good music (if only she'd keep to the beat).  If you want to do this, I suggest doing your own decent warm up first, because on cold muscles, it's a shock to them for sure, but after doing that yourself, this is a good dvd to workout to.",1245196800,11,1094,4.374384236453202
3765099,5,B001QIVEPA,"High intensity, low impact; Combine a lot of different musical groups with the exercise. I love it.",1244851200,2,99,4.882352941176471
3765100,5,B001QIVEPA,Great Video!!!!  Really gets your heart rate up in a short amount of time. Elise is so poised and takes you through the paces quickly and easily.  I love it!!!!,1243382400,3,160,4.3
3765101,5,B001QIVEPA,"I have had a chance to do a bunch of different combinations of the 10 and 20-minute workouts on this DVD and every one of them has been awesome.  If you're like me and don't always have a ton of time to work out, this is the solution - every segment is incredibly efficient and really gives you a full body workout.  It's awesome!!",1242345600,14,331,4.15625
3765102,5,B001QIVEPA,"I just got this DVD and have been using it almost daily (in addition to Elise's Yoga workout).  I'm a total gym rat, and my job takes me away from home for 2 weeks out of the month.  The gym in this small town is horrible, so I am stuck using the fitness center in the hotel.  (Does a stationary bike count as a ""center""?)  I have been using this DVD for over a week and am realizing that I don't have to spend an hour on the treadmill and an hour on the spin bike for a great workout.  This 20 minutes really kicks my butt!  I'm loving it!  I'm so happy that I found this workout!  I don't need much room, and I pack my 3lb weights in my carry-on when I travel.  Elise is an amazing, inspiring instructor!  She will whip your butt into shape and have you smiling along the way.  Thanks, Elise!!",1241568000,22,795,4.0
3765103,5,B001QIVEPA,"Elise Gulan does an AMAZING job with choreographing this DVD! There is minimal equipment required, just a set of 3 lb weights. Elise is an excellent instructor. She has an upbeat (not annoying) personality, her cueing is right on, and she reminds you to breathe- something I tend to forget =)  There are modifications for beginner and advanced with Elise demonstrating intermediate/advanced.

SHAPE:20 Minute Makeover DVD has two main sections:

+ 20-minute interval training
+ Target toning segments; arms,abs,lower-body,&cardio

The 20 minute interval training, alternates low intensity moves with high energy cardio. Elise does a great job getting the heart rate up utilizing the high/low technique -using lunge lifts, squat throws, jumping jacks, and plie jumps. The low intensity moves involve holding positions while pulsing then switching to flowing movements. She also incorporates balance, so grab a chair just in case, there are some wobbly moments =)
These twenty minutes are fierce!!!

Targeted Toning Segments - 10 min. each.  These 10 minute segments are INTENSE! Elise mentions stream-lining the body, several muscles groups are involved in addition to the targeted muscle. She gets a lot done in such little time - it is unbelievable how effective these exercises are!!

ARM SEGMENT:  Begins with plank movements also hitting glute & core. Next, push-ups followed by planks with flowing knee movements. Elise moves on to triceps - this is a TOUGH TOUGH set. Last couple minutes Elise hits biceps, shoulders, anterior deltoids, & rhomboids.  I used three pound weights for this, and barely made it through.

AB SEGMENT:  The first four minutes, moves are done sitting hinged forward position. Then Elise moves to a round back position - continues with variations of this with bent & straight leg positions. She finishes with bent knee bicycle position increasing intensity by straightening legs & lifting arms.

LOWER BODY SEGMENT:  Starts with plies and releves, great calf work =) She moves onto second position plie forward pulses targeting inner thighs, downward pulses for quads continually upping the intensity. Elise finishes with lunges, triangle pose with pulses, and glute lifts. Advanced exercisers have the option to use a weight to increase intensity.

CARDIO BLAST:  The go to move (step touch/bob & weave/skating reach & tap)is alternated between high/low exercises; squat pulses with jumps, curtsy dips, jump rope, and football drills.

SHAPE 20 minute Makeover is one of the BEST fitness dvds I have come across. I highly recommend this for intermediate through advanced exercisers. Beginners only should get this if they are serious about wanting to improve their fitness level and don't get easily discouraged.

3765144,5,B001QIVEPA,"This dvd is great. I love the instruction and general feeling of the workout. Elise Gulan does a wonderful job explaining things simply and thoroughly while not being a distraction to the job at hand.

3765151,4,B001QIVEPA,"I think overall this is a really good workout but I did have some problems with it. Most of it is just personal, like the way Elise is acting like the workout is hard (not quite sure how to describe this) she obviously wouldn't have trouble with any of the exercises but it seems she is ""faking"" gasping and whining which for me isn't a good motivational tool, it makes the workout seem harder than it actually is. I really don't feel the leg section gave me a good workout, ironically the ab section made my legs hurt really bad and I could barely follow along. The arm section and cardio sections are great. I feel bad about writing this review but I wanted to be truthful. I real like Elise Gulan, her Ballet Conditioning workout DVD is one of my favorites and I lost a lot of weight and toned up from doing it regularly a few years ago. I guess I was hoping this DVD would be more like that just with more cardio and divided into more sections. I will still use the Shape DVD for the cardio and arm sections and use her other DVD for abs and legs.",1406246400,,1051,4.182266009852217

3765153,5,B001QIVEPA,"I attest this video to really making a difference in my body. I've been doing it once a week for about 2 years now and I still feel the burn after each time.  Because you can customize your work out it doesn't get old.  I will do the 50 minutes of the video or just pieces like arms and abs mixed with a light run or hike.  Elise is an EXCELLENT trainer, who's encouraging the entire way through. Her moves and upbeat personality will get you results and more importantly feeling good.",1400371200,,485,4.25

3765165,3,B001QIVEPA,I was expecting this to be more low impact. Also includes weights in many activities. Short segments are convenient though.,1396656000,,123,5.2
3765166,5,B001QIVEPA,"I am really impressed with the intensity of these short workouts. As a graduate student I appreciate the time saver, and I don't feel like I am skimping out on a thorough workout, which makes it easier for me to work out often and really accomplish something. I hate doing short workouts and feeling like that was a waste and then getting discouraged because I don't have an hour or hour and a half everyday to exercise. And I really like Elise Gulan's coaching style as I first experienced through her Ballet Conditioning DVD.",1388707200,,527,4.617021276595745
3765167,5,B001QIVEPA,"I began doing this as one who was totally out of shape, but became aware of progress pretty soon.  I'm not very disciplined so it gives me an incentive when I realize the exercise is getting easier.  It's designed in a way where you can push yourself as hard as you want to.  I like how the instructor acknowledges beginners--encouraging them to lean on a chair for balance, go back to an easier move, or rest for a minute if you have to.  As you improve, you not only have the option of increasing frequency (how many days you do it or times per day you do it), but the option of increasing difficulty, which means you will get your money's worth--it will be useful and challenging for a long time--unless you're already in top-notch shape.",1380758400,,741,4.426470588235294
3765168,5,B001QIVEPA,I exercise regularly & was bored with my other dvds. This one was great for someone not completely out of shape.,1380585600,,112,4.380952380952381
3765169,5,B001QIVEPA,This is a solid workout.  I like that the workouts are not too long - 20 minutes and also 10 minute options.  Very solid workout.  Good for my DVD collection.,1377388800,,158,4.2

good instruction, decent music, and her attitude is great

3765172,3,B001QIVEPA,"The workouts are ok, not my favorite. I just wish the instructor stopped reminding me to smile, I'm just saying.",1359849600,,112,4.65
3765173,4,B001QIVEPA,"Like many people, I've bought several fitness DVD's over the years only to lose motivation quickly. But I really enjoy this DVD for two main reasons: (1) it's the perfect length to be both motivating and effective and (2) the moves are clear and simple, so I'm not staring at the instructor feeling stupid as well as out-of-shape.

I mostly use the 20 minute routine, which is a great all-around workout. It alternates cardio intervals with strength training moves. You don't need any special equipment or a lot of space. The workout is physically challenging (I'm a complete beginner), but not so overwhelming that I can't follow along with most of it. I really love that there are 3 levels for each workout. After just two weeks, I was able to move up to intermediate on a couple exercises, though I still spend most of the workout at beginner level. I like that the video will continue to challenge me as my fitness level improves.

The instructor is really great. She gives cheerful, easy to follow directions and offers encouragement and modifications during the exercises beginners will struggle with most. One warning, though: some modifications for total beginners (e.g., ""If a cardio move gets too intense for you, you always have the option to go back to a simple step-and-tap move instead"" or ""feel free to hold on to a chair for balance if you need to"") are not offered until late in the video.

It's only 20 minutes of my day, but it leaves me feeling sweaty and ridiculously proud of myself. I've already been more consistent with it than any other dvd I own, because I really feel the difference in myself after completing the workout. It's challenging, yes, but the straightforward exercises and interval format keep it fun.  Definitely recommend it!",1348790400,,1766,4.7993421052631575
3765184,5,B001QIVEPA,I found this DVD helpful. There were some routines I hadn't thought about before. Watching this motivated me to change of my stale workouts.,1343174400,,140,4.875
3765185,4,B001QIVEPA,"I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and regularly workout to all her videos 5-6 days a week. I have been inserting a few different videos here and there to change up my routine and I purchased Shape: 20 Minute Makeover because I was looking for another 20 minute workout routine. Right away, I instantly connected with this video and plugged through the entire workout (the initial 20 minutes plus all the 10 minute add on's) and could not believe how much fun I was having and how quickly the time flew by. This is by far, not the most intense workout I have ever done and yet it really is an efficient workout. Elise incorporates a lot of core strength and stability. The exercises are not super difficult, I work up a decent sweat but I am not huffing or puffing.  And yet I feel very satisfied at the end of the workout and I am sore the next day, mainly my abdominals. I love how much she draws from yoga and pilates and the cardio really is good for people that need less impact. I have a hard time believing that this will be a major weight loss tool (not enough challenge, not enough high intensity cardio) but I am definitely happy to have this as part of my weekly workout regime, I circulate it once or twice during the week and I am already feeling my core getting stronger. The arm segment is also really good for building tricep strength, I was shocked that I had to do some of the exercises in this segment without 3 lb weights because my arms were getting so sore. I am also building up to doing the complete ab section as I have to modify it and take some quick breaks because I am not used to using such deep core strength. So even though this video is not super difficult, there is plenty for me to work up to and to grow into. I can honestly say that this is the most fun workout video that I own and the time goes by the quickest. I find Elise Gulan to have a great personality, she is motivating and down to earth. I highly recommend this video to those of you that are lookign to challenge your muscles in a new way and for those that are drawn to yoga/pilates fusion type workouts. I am looking into other videos with Elise Gulan because of how much I loved this one.",1336262400,11,2188,4.20952380952381
3765186,2,B001QIVEPA,"I've done alot of workout videos but this one was just pointless. the cardio was okay but i didn't like the 10 minute toning segments. some of the moves were lame and didn't make sense. the lower body segment was very disappointing. the moves doesn't really target the buns & thighs. Normally you would feel some type of burn when working the lower body but i felt nothing. you could've sat on the floor for 10 minutes and got the same result. Same for the abs segment. If you are going to create a 10 minute workout, make sure the moves are really intense and effective. I would not recommend this dvd for those who want to lose weight. this is more for toning and firming. if you are looking for a good toning video i would definitely recommend Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones. For a real bun & thigh workout...try Winsor Pilates Bun & Thigh Sculpting. For a real total body makeover in under 30 minutes, try Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred.",1334361600,,949,4.459770114942529
3765187,2,B001QIVEPA,"I have been buying a variety of workout DVD's since I started working out daily about 6 months ago.  I only workout at home using DVD's, and I have found some really great ones.  This Shape workout was totally boring.  The music is bad, the moves are blah.  I could only get thru the first 10 minutes or so, before I turned it off.  I will be donating this one to who ever will take it.",1333929600,,386,4.026315789473684
3765188,4,B001QIVEPA,"This is definitely a tough workout for those who are young or already have some level of fitness.  Beginners should stay away from it until they are to the point where they can handle some significant intensity.  If you are just starting a fitness program and are overweight, out of shape or over 40, this will be too difficult for you initially and may perhaps discourage you from continuing with your fitness program.  Best to start with somerthing that is more doable and uplifting but still gives lots of benefits, like anything in the Leslie Sansone line.  Eventually, you will get to the point where you can handle the workout on this DVD, but this is not a starter program.",1328745600,,680,4.641666666666667

3765190,5,B001QIVEPA,"I love this dvd. It is a nice addition to my workout collection. I like doing this workout when I am feeling less motivated because it is short but effective. I can get a quick workout in and not have to devote an hour or more. The instructor is easy to follow- coming from somone as uncoordinated as I am, that says a lot.",1319760000,,323,4.0625

3765192,4,B001QIVEPA,"While I won't give this DVD 5 stars (I like to reserve *something* for those that are truly ""outstanding""), it is definitely one of the best ones I own--and I own a LOT of workout DVDs. For someone who doesn't have a lot of extra time to spend on extended exercise, I like my workouts to be efficient and effective, and this definitely meets the mark.
The host/choreographer might be a tad annoying and overly cheerful, but it's easy to forgive her, seeing as you get 5 routines on the disc (a total of 60 minutes--20 total body, 10 upper body, 10 abs, 10 lower body and 10 cardio-specific) and each of them is a knockout. The ab and upper body workouts in particular totally kicked my butt, and I'm already ""in shape"". The lower body, cardio, and total-body workouts are also challenging, and what I love most about each and every one of them is that there's never a time when you're working only ONE muscle. Each routine, each move in fact, targets multiple muscle groups throughout the body so that you truly do get your money and times worth.
Overall I would recommend this workout to anyone looking to cut time without cutting the benefits of exercise, and who wants a *total body* experience. After doing each routine a few times I can tell that they're not about bulking up--it's about being lean all over, and toning muscles, with underlying strength that's not overtly (and unattractively) muscular in appearance.

Heck I'm not even in good shape. lol  I am 40 with 5 kids and need to lose about 20 lbs to get to my high school, goal, weight. I did this DVD for the first time and was sore for days. I couldn't even do it again for like 3 days. It really works the thighs and butt. This was also just the cardio section. Now I have read reviews that says this is to easy and not a good workout. Well if you are middle aged and not in great shape, it's a killer. You would have to be in EXCELLENT shape for this not to be an efficient workout. I recommend this if you want to see results. With the way my lower half feels, there is no way I won't see results. I do recommend taking it slowly. She has one of the girls preform it modified to a level 1. That's the one I do and it still kicks butt! It has an upper body section that works a lot of the core and abs as well. Me I think this is a good buy.....",1305158400,5,1018,3.7348837209302324
3765204,4,B001QIVEPA,"The ""interval training,"" ""lower body sculpt,"" and ""cardio conditioning"" segments easily band together to form an effective 40 minute workout that will blast some serious calories and tone the lower abs on down.

The ""flat abs"" and ""sculpted arms"" sections offer serious challenge for everything above the waist.  I am about 6', 140 lbs and i can execute 15-20 ""real"" pushups in one go but the tricep dips portion of the arm workout made me collapse on my tush in about five seconds.  Be prepared for an upper body challenge.  You will also hold the body in variations of plank position for long periods of time.

Cons:  Some folks might feel that the instructor talks too much.
Pros:  This DVD breaks away from the same-ol lunges and jumps and so forth.  Most of this dvd is low-impact without sacrificing intensity and includes some fun balletic elements.",1303171200,3,856,4.815068493150685

3765209,4,B001QIVEPA,"This is another great DVD from Shape & a good value with the ability to mix & match your workout.

The main 30 minute workout has a nice flow - I worked up a light sweat, but don't really consider it a strong cardio routine. Great for beginners/intermediate exercisers. You can make it more challenging by adding weights. There are also four 10 minute segments which you can do alone or combine to make a more complete workout. These 10 minute segments focus on a specific body area, but all definitely rock your abs! I feel like a lot of it is more Pilates-inspired (you don't wear shoes), but it is a great way to add some long/lean muscle toning to your routine.

The instructor, Elise Gulan, is not your typical fitness instructor - she is pretty mellow & sweet, which is great for this workout. My only complaint is that she keeps mentioning how this is your timesaving workout - sometimes a bit too much, as I don't like to continuously be reminded of the time while exercising - but really, not a big deal.

I also had a sprained ankle.  This workout is easy on the joints; by using squats and knee lifts to give you high intensity yet low impact.

There are some jumping sequences, which I find difficult, and thank you! there are modifications, which I mostly use.  The toning segments are slightly challenging for me, especially the abs section!  I enjoy the lower body segment because it has some ballet, easy on my joints.",1261180800,,509,4.872093023255814
3765212,5,B001QIVEPA,"I bought this workout DVD after buying (and enjoying the heck out of) Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning DVD. Elise is a wonderful, encouraging instructor (not the shouty type, for sure). I enjoy this video - and especially the results I've gotten after only 2 weeks. The 20 minute interval training is an excellent short workout that really gets your heart rate going while building your strength in butt, thighs, and calves. One of my favorite aspects of this workout is the three women on screen - so you can follow either beginner, intermediate, or advanced, depending on your abilities. I appreciate this because it means I can continue doing the workout after I've increased my fitness level (which was around zero when I started!). There are an additional four 10-minute videos for extra cardio, arms, abs, and lower body, so you can tailor your workout and keep your interest level high. All in all, this is my second favorite exercise video (after Ballet). Highly recommended!",1260921600,5,984,4.96969696969697
3765213,4,B001QIVEPA,"The DVD has a few very good workouts on it. However this was a deal where the DVD was ""free"" if you subscribed to the magazine - and I never got the magazine. So essentially the DVD cost around $15. Not a very good bargain at that price.",1252713600,,237,3.9583333333333335

8335743,5,B001QIVEPA,"This is my go to workout!  It makes me sweat and it gets results.

This alternates between a few minutes low impact cardio and strength training.  The moves are easy enough for everyone to do and there are modifications to make it easier or harder on you.  It is all low intensity but still gets results.  I love that it is only 20 minutes long so I can fit it in any day.  And I really love that there are also target toning sections that are only 10 minutes long.

Because of the intervals it boosts your metabolism and burns fat.  Do it 3 times a week and you will definitely notice results within only a few weeks.

Elise Gulan is one of my favorite instructors she is upbeat without being annoying.  She talks a lot but will keep you motivated and gives good cuing and countdowns.  The routine is fresh and new and not standard of what you usually see.  There is some standing ab work that reminds you of her ballet background.

Overall great work out that I do at least once a week.  Love it.",1445904000,3,998,4.23936170212766

I have bought this DVD three times, and if this copy disappears I'll buy it again.
It's that awesome.
At one time I could do the ENTIRE DVD, which takes about an hour, but I'm still trying to work my way back up to that fitness level.",1439164800,,264,4.096153846153846

I am a Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner work out fan, but I can honestly say that this Shape video equates to my favorite rotations!  My favorite  exercise routine is the 10-minute arm workout: Wow! A Killer!  I combine it with the ab and lower body workout  when I feel hyped. I love it!!",1433203200,3,391,4.514285714285714
