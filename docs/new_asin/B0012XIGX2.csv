8248095,2,B0012XIGX2,"I received this two disc set as a Christmas gift and just got a chance to watch it. Unfortunately disc one seemed overly familiar to me. This is because it is also sold as ""Ultimate Nascar DVD Collection - Nascar Thrills"". Disc two may be a ""repeat too, but I'm not familiar with it. I wish companies would stop reissuing product under different names. It is dishonest and disaapointing.",1295568000,4,387,4.6231884057971016
