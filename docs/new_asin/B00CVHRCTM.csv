5742847,5,B00CVHRCTM,"Once in awhile you come across a movie that touches your heart like no other and Camp certainly is such! Based on true stories it is said not just to entertain but to inspire!
I guarantee you will not soon forget it!

It is not an easy tale to hear or see but Eli's story (and those of his camp mates!) is well worth a moment of your time for this is what so many foster children face daily: abandonment, abuse, betrayal, lack of love and support to name just a few.
Some like Eli are more than a challenge for their caretakers/ counselors as Ken soon finds out! For one week, these children are given the opportunity to be happy and carefree and the outstanding work of the counselors can make a difference in their lives!

Camp is the story of one such ten year old child named Eli and a reluctant counselor whom despite his initial annoyance with his assigned camper learns to care enough to reach out to the troubled boy. Ken of course is not your usual counselor...Face it, he drives a Porshe and he is only there to impress a potential client!

The movie showcases some of the cases documented by Royal Family Kids counselors and will have you laughing and crying!

The actors (Michael Mattera as Eli's counselor and Miles Elliott as Eli) did a wonderful job in reenacting this moving story but for my part Asante Jones in the role of Counselor Samuel wins top marks: he is unforgettable!

Despite its epilogue which I felt a bit too good to be true (albeit yet again based on a true story!) I give it 5 stars!

Note to Readers:

Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, some violence, a crude gesture and brief language.

5742848,5,B00CVHRCTM,"I love it when you watch a movie that (1) is based on true stories and (2) moves you to tears and action. Such is the case on the latest DVD from Word Films, CAMP. Based on true stories from camp counselors, founders of Royal Family Kids and even former campers, CAMP takes a look through the ways in which volunteers who work at CAMP Pine, one week a year to help troubled kids forget their personal problems and provide a way to have fun and be loved in ways they could only imagine.

Ken Matthews is your typical ego centered financial advisor who believes that life revolves around making even more money than he already has. When a potential client is about to slip through his fingers, his assistant convinces her that Ken has offered to volunteer at a summer camp she sponsors as a way to give back to the community. Seeing this as a chance to secure the deal of a lifetime, Ken agrees to head to a camp for young kids believing it will simply be a piece of cake. He is instructed to read the rules of being a volunteer counselor since he is joining pretty late into the program, which he believes is optional and more trouble than it's worth. He fails to understand just what he has signed up for until he arrives at Camp Pine and finds himself as Eli's counselor.

Eli is a young boy who has been abused by both of his parents and now lives in Foster care. His whole life has been a series of reminders that he is neither good enough or worthy enough of any love. What he finds in Ken is someone who reminds him of his parents, someone who is buying their time until they are rid of Eli. So Eli lashes out at not only Ken but the other kids in camp further isolating himself from the group in an attempt to justify how everyone in his life has made him feel. Will Ken be able to find a way to reach Eli before he does something that will not only risk his own life but the lives of everyone at camp?

I received CAMP compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. This is a hard film to watch since it involves the abuse of a young boy, but we can't just pretend these things don't happen because we don't want to see them. The best part of this DVD is the incredible organization Royal Family KIDS which the true inspiration that makes this a must see. It will move you to tears and will hopefully move you to action either in involving yourself as a volunteer for Royal Family KIDS or even to financial support them in any way possible. It is simply too hard to not doing anything after watching this amazing inspirational and truly unforgettable life-changing movie. I personally rate it a 5 out of 5 stars.",1378080000,,2701,4.2818003913894325
5742849,4,B00CVHRCTM,"Inspired by true stories from Royal Family KIDS, Inc., this is a film that draws you in, breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and leaves you with both hope for these kids and a desire to make a difference. My attitude, much like Ken's, changed from when I first started watching the movie as I begin to see beyond the actors and situations that seemed like standard characters/plots that set the standard for many formulaic films. There is [mild] bad language coming out of the mouths of some of the kids (PG 13), but it fits the defiant characters of some. I also confess that I initially disliked the Redford character, but his optimism and vulnerability melted away my reserve as I both considered the pain this child has suffered and admired the joy he displayed and the kindness he genuinely displayed toward others.

I attended a few church camps when I was younger, and the film brought back memories of friends, activities and the required camp singalongs! The difference is that these kids are those who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, and this week of camp may be the only fun in their lives for the year. There are only 5 short days to show the kids that they are valuable, loved, and have a reason to hope...but it is well worth it. My favorite character, Sgt. Sam, tells Ken, ""You're not the foster parent or the caregiver. You're not the teacher. You're just here to help the kid have fun for one week.""

Directed by Jacob Roebuck, CAMP is a film that you can enjoy watching for the story, but one that I hope inspires more to make a difference in a child's life. The acting was good and the scenery was gorgeous. Glimpses of the inner fears of the kids break your heart, but the way the counselors handle each situation demonstrates a hope that the kids can cling to for their future. The letters of encouragement sent and shared were among my favorite scenes. A film on a tough subject, but interspersed with enough humor to keep it uplifting. There are several BTS & personal story videos included in Special Features, plus there is a Director's Commentary!! Well done!

5742858,1,B00CVHRCTM,"This simply has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  I disliked the movie so much I'm taking the time to write this review.

The acting was poor, the story line is superficial, and at times I thought I was watching an infomercial for Porsche vehicles.  The story line also touts a) money with happiness, b) the guy with the hot vehicle gets the chick, and c) fairy tail endings always happen.

There were a few pluses.  a) the movie suggests how two people with differing lives can connect - this is why I watch the movie to begin with, b) how abuse can control a person,  c) how abused people love their abuser - which happens quite a bit..",1477958400,,660,4.24

I won't give anything away, it is a must-see film. the young boy in there reminds me of myself. I wish they had such a camp when I was a child. I had a very hard time watching it. Because it so fit my childhood. If you are looking for an on the spot film this is it, it is based on an actual camp, that deals with foster kids. Very powerful movie, be sure to watch all the bonus materials.

5742892,5,B00CVHRCTM,"My younger siblings (10,12, and 14 years of age) watched this film and started a campaign to make sure the rest of us got to be blessed by it too. One by one my other siblings watched it with them and I heard over and over again, ""Wow, that is a really great movie. You really need to watch it."" Finally, I had time and I got to sit down with them to experience it as well.

Less than halfway through watching this film, I thought, ""This is for me. This is what God wants me to do."" It was the start of an adventure that culminated in my being a counselor at a Royal Family Kids Camp this summer.

The movie Camp is a beautiful story about the intersection of two lives that changed them both. Children are so vulnerable, and yet so ready to receive love. And we adults can get so caught up in unimportant, selfish things. Bring the two together and amazing things can happen. I'm not sure which of us were more blessed by RFKC--my campers or me. But it was a wonderful, impactful time for all three of us that I know will stay with us forever.

5742896,4,B00CVHRCTM,"This movie felt like it was adhering to a lot of tired tropes of working with foster care youth just like a bad after-school special. However, at the end (NOT A SPOILER - I promise) as the credits roll, you realize that the stories and situations from the screenplay are real stories. That really gave me a whole new appreciation for this movie.

The script tries to do too many things, the actors aren't exactly Oscar-worthy (in fact the lead role of Ken is played with a complete level of apathy that no real human being is capable of and absolutely NO subtlety. Not to directors and actors, your audiences like characters to be nuanced, not wooden), and some of the technical aspects of the film aren't great.

However, this film has HEART and it is a movie made with the best of intentions to showcase a GREAT organization, Royal Family Kids. For me, Camp is like a lot of low-budget, inspirational films: I can look past its filmmaking failings in order to see and appreciate the heart and message of the film.",1418083200,,1015,4.540983606557377

I loved that up until almost the end, the plot turned around and the obnoxious kid was the one pursuing the camp counselor to be taken in and given a loving home, instead of the counselor bending over backwards to win the kid over to help him have a few good days at camp.  Funny, surprising, but heart-warming!",1413763200,,335,4.301587301587301
5742900,5,B00CVHRCTM,"For a small independent movie, this one is surprisingly good! The acting, particularly of the young boy, while perhaps not being Oscar-worthy, is still believable enough and perfectly fine. This movie is a bit slow to get going, but once it does, you will find it tugging on your heart-strings - and ultimately leaving you feeling both encouraged and motivated.

If you've never thought much about abused kids, this movie can be an eye-opener as it explores some of the real emotions and behaviors such kids can exhibit. At the same time, it also shows what the power of God's love working through the hands and words of caring adults can do. If you have ever experienced abuse or work in the social services field, I believe you will probably be especially blessed by this movie.

This movie while definitely dealing with some serious subject matter, also has lots of lighter moments - even funny ones. There's even a little mild romance. Sometimes it can be kind of easy to turn a blind-eye to the hurting in our community, but God cares a whole lot about hurting kids - and as believers that means we need to care a whole about them too! I definitely recommend this movie!

I highly recommend this movie as it tells a wonderful story (inspired by many true ones!) and encourages people to make a difference in the lives of children in need. The special features include stories from staff at Royal Family KIDS camps who share true stories that inspired and made it into the film. There is also a testimony from a girl whose life was transformed after visiting Royal Family KIDS camp. I'd say more, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.

5742906,4,B00CVHRCTM,"I'm a devout Christian with a heart for the arts. As such, I am always excited when someone attempts to make a movie in line with my faith, but I am often chagrined at the lack of artistic prowess that gets lost in making a film overly ""preachy"" (e.g. ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof"").  Camp is the now the third faith-based movie that I would actually recommend to any of my friends (""The Second Chance"" and ""Unconditional"" are the others).  It was tough to get rid of my apprehension in the first 15 to 30 minutes, but eventually I easily relaxed into just enjoying the story and how it unfolded. Plenty of twists, turns, and truth. There were at least two scenes that I gritted my teeth knowing they would be the scenes when we would get a 2 minute prayer or a 5 minute presentation of the gospel, but the movie kept it subtle. The message being based in faith is clear and strong, but not ham-fisted in the slightest.

5742912,5,B00CVHRCTM,"I was pleasantly surprised when watching this movie.  It delves into the little known backgrounds of the kids that end up in foster care, from the good to the bad.  I heartily applaud Royal Family Kids fro making this film to show the world how much they do for the few they are able to ""Camp"" each year, and how much the counselors will go out of their way to make sure a child can have a bit of hope and fun for a week and (at least for the week) see how a ""normal"" kid has fun at camp.  Being based entirely on true stories and situations, it gives a prospective Foster Parent a real idea of what to expect and what some kids go through before entering the system (and what some endure and never get out of their situation).  It may even inspire you to become involved in a Royal Family camp somewhere near you.  A Five Star film in my book, and recommed it to anyone interested in fostering.

5742915,5,B00CVHRCTM,"So my close friends or should I say sisters went to watch this movie together. Years ago all three of us went to Royal Family Kid's Camp(the camp this movie is based on) together as staff. It had been 7 yrs since I last attended camp and longer for my sisters.  This movie made me feel like I was at camp again and oooh how I missed it so much  I felt an overwhelming feeling watching the bus drive down in the movie cause I remember the feeling of the real bus coming and seeing all those beautiful children arriving at camp. Yes we did jump up and down in excitement just like the movie. Yes we do have a tea party for the girls, man camp for the boys, a surprise birthday party for the kids, a talent show, swimming, and more. Plus the kids have breakfast club with fun games and skits as well as Bible time which is awesome! We also help decorate our cabins according to the theme of the camp so when campers arrive the room isn't just plain but there could be streamers, posters, etc. and each camper has his/her name posted on the beds with each campers name meaning. Plus the campers  have gifts laid out on their beds too. This is a camp like no other. The Love at camp is so overwhelming. You can feel God's indescribable presence all around. And for kids who come in a shell to camp open up and have fun by the end of the week. It's like they transform right before your eyes. It's amazing. Yes there are issues that arise because these children have been through so much, but that doesn't stop camp. Nor does it stop God from showering us with unending Blessings. We don't give up, we keep going. That's what these children need.  I will say camp does cause some emotional roller coasters inside of you just as you feel when watching this movie. You will feel joy and sadness  because you get to love on these children but at the same time hurt for these children and you attach to them for the week and its hard to see them go, but go. Pray up and ask God to use you to be Jesus to them and love them.  No you can't fix them in a week, but they will at least get to be somewhere they can feel safe and happy and secure and you are there to be a part of that.  You are there to encourage and praise and love.  To show them that they are a part of a Royal Family , God's Royal Family and they are not forgotten.",1394150400,16,2321,4.096916299559472
5742916,5,B00CVHRCTM,"I'm not sure how uplifting this message is when the subject matter is abused children but this movie (based on real events) ended on a upbeat note. The message is honestly better than the acting but it seems heartfelt and earnest.

I think when we live our normal middle class lives, we hear about the horrors and we know about the sadness but we tend to think someone else will fix the problem, this story makes you want to help.

The movie centers around on a  camp for abused children, there is the reality of broken children and what the camp counselors go through to try and give these children one week of happiness. There is displayed the fruits of the spirit and there is lots of prayer.

I loved the movie.

In our country of so much wealth it's so sad that so many of our people go without and especially when it's children",1393286400,4,833,4.348387096774194

5742919,5,B00CVHRCTM,This movie will tear at your heart.  I watched it with my 15 year old son and I'm very glad he got to see it.  It showed that not all kids have loving parents and those that do should be thankful.,1392336000,9,196,3.7560975609756095
5742920,4,B00CVHRCTM,"If I have to be honest, I was tempted to turn off this movie just a little bit after it started. It was a little slow-moving and the acting left a little to be desired, but I'm glad I didn't. Once we actually got to ""camp"" the action picked up, the acting got better, and the story fell into place. I was thoroughly engaged. And let me tell you, this one tugs at the heartstrings...and the tear ducts. For a special bonus, watch the special features, and you'll be cheering for and inspired by the real-life heroes on which this movie is based.

For it being a Christian movie, I was disappointed in a few curse words and one obscene gesture, but I still loved the movie. I am aware there are kids who have it rough. That there are kids shuffled from one foster home to another, but it is still good to watch a movie like this that reminds us of that and rekindles a desire to do something. What, I have no idea, but I wanted to go and adopt a bunch of kids after watching the movie. That isn't possible at this point, but maybe I can do something.

5742922,5,B00CVHRCTM,"Genuinely touching, sad, funny, painful, real, and hopeful. Unexpectedly well written, well acted (especially by the kids), and surprising. It is heartbreaking to see what some kids go through in their so-called childhood. It'll also make you want to sign up to be a camp counselor.

There are some mentions of God and a couple of mentions of Jesus - this is a camp run by Christians, after all - but no outright preaching.

Stay for the credits. You'll see clips of the real people involved.",1389916800,,492,4.709302325581396

I loved that they acknowledged God and talked about prayer changing things because God is the only One that can truly take even the bad things and turn them for good.",1389571200,,385,4.273972602739726

5742925,4,B00CVHRCTM,This is a very touching story but the writing was very amateur and it's a bit preachy. The plot is based on a collection of several different stories combined into one super story and by doing so lost quite a bit of authenticity.,1389139200,3,229,4.348837209302325
5742926,5,B00CVHRCTM,"Great movie---excellent subjects to talk about with your children.  Has many talking points:  why we don't take drugs---why we don't have sex with someone that we are not married to and have created a REAL home to raise children in---why we don't tell people to go to hell---why it is important to spend TIME with our children, and probably very important to my wife and I is that we have never visited an orphanage, even though one of our best friends is the director, because we could not leave without adopting a couple children.  [I should caution you that if you have a big heart, love children, and have enough money, you may not want to watch this film---if I was not a senior I would probably adopt several children.]",1388793600,,725,4.561538461538461

5742928,5,B00CVHRCTM,"CAMP tells the untold stories of youth in the foster care system.  The film depicts a week-long camp for foster kids, and explores the relationship between Eli - a tough foster kid with a tragic background, and his counselor, Ken.  Ken is volunteering at CAMP for the wrong reasons, and goes on a journey towards hope as well.

I've volunteered for years with an organization similar to the camp depicted in the film.  It perfectly captures the heart, exhaustion, and humor I experience during my week serving at this camp.  Buy this film, be inspired by the story, then go volunteer at a camp in YOUR community!",1378339200,,612,4.682242990654205
5742929,4,B00CVHRCTM,"Camp is a very touching, inspiring DVD. Your heart will go out to Eli as he is forgotten and abused, but also you will watch as he goes to Camp and she how most of the counselors want to help and comfort these children.
  Ken just wants to be a counselor to look good so he will win a business deal. He really doesn't care about Eli or any of the other children.
  During this DVD you will see the struggles, heartbreaks, the healing and melting of hearts and attitudes. It is such a refreshing film that shows us we need to be involved and help others. Especially those who can't help themselves.
  Things start to get better between Eli and Ken, until Eli's father comes and all kinds of troubles and chaos happens. Will things change and be better or will trouble and violence continue?
  I really enjoyed this movie, because it is put together from a real life situation. I recommend it. It will open your eyes to how some children have to live.
