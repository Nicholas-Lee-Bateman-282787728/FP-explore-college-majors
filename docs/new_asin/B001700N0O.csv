8264270,1,B001700N0O,"Fight club. Vampires. Cop with a childhood vendetta. Add some bad acting and uneven sound.

The 1977 flashback film is grainy and washed because in 1977 that was all you could buy from Kodak. Since it wasn't found footage, why make it so bad? There is also plenty of gore and a metal soundtrack which make the film near cult. The cop was able to locate the Vampire Fight Club, because the first rule of Vampire fight club is ""we need new blood."" Watched as part of a muti-pack DVD.

8264271,1,B001700N0O,"This video monstrosity came as part of a twenty movie package called: 20 FILM HORROR SET, VOL.1.  Had it not been for that fact, I would never (especially after having watched this train wreck) have purchased this film.

I am genuinely astounded at how bad this movie really is: The script, if you can call it that, is just awful.  My six year old creates better dialogue while playing with his toys.

The 'actors' in it are more wooden than the tree on my front yard; I honestly have seen better acting at a pre-school nativity play! The (not so) special effects would have been more convincing if they had been drawn on the actors with a crayon.  Animated muzzle flashes from prop firearms, and sparks from ricochet shots off of DVDs in a Movie Store!  Every shot that missed was followed with a 'ping' noise, and the animated spark to signify the near miss... which is exactly what this movie is - a near miss at an attempt at doing something credible.

The fight scenes are just dull, which is a shame as it looks to have some fairly talented martial artists in the cast, who are wasted by having to interact with untrained actors, and sub-par fight scenes.

Len Kabasinski needs to understand the concept of ""take two"". I have thought long and hard to try and find at least one redeeming quality of this movie and the best that I can come up with is that it is slightly better than having a root canal without the anesthesia.  That having been said, it was purely painful to sit through this one, and had it not been for my good friend Jack Daniels, it would have been impossible.

If only there was a mark lower that 1 star I could award this pile of nonsense. Just please don't waste your time or money on this film, you have been warned.  Even getting another 19 movies in the pack does not offset the awfulness of this particular film.",1350259200,2,1844,4.410029498525073
8264272,2,B001700N0O,"Fist of the Vampire had more potential than Curse of the Wolf, but succeeded slightly.  Fist of the Vampire is kung fu vampire flick, that barely had vampire stuff in it.  Darian Caine also is in it, she's better in this than in Curse of the Wolf.",1215820800,2,247,4.23404255319149
