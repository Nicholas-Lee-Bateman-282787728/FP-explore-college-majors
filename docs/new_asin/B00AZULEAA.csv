5538620,1,B00AZULEAA,"I was a part of this film and am extremely disappointed. Had there been any other influence on this film it may have been decent. The lighting in this film was just bad. Many of the shot's were tri-pod(very dull). The story line dragged out to mind numbing proportions. I was not happy with the final product. After all the time and effort put into it, it should have been much better.",1266278400,3,385,4.361111111111111
5538621,1,B00AZULEAA,"I would not spend more than $4 dollars on this so called movie. I was a big part of this movie, though I am credited for less than i would like. I have spent 2+ years of my life and much of my creative effort on this project, as did many others who get little or no credit. I was told that this was a team effort and found out later that I wouldn't recieve a dime, plus my work would receive little appreciation. If you want to waste your money on this backhanded lie of a film, go ahead but when you play it and in anger say ""$15 I got screwed!"" I warned you. This is a reveiw of my relationship with this team, as far as the movie itself it is well, low budget and i was disappointed in the editing, as well as the camera work.",1266278400,3,729,3.8666666666666667

8559910,4,B00AZULEAA,"This is a continuation from part 1. It includes seven episodes. Overall I felt this was a step down from the first part, but not as bad as sequel as ""Return to Oz..""  It weighs in at about 2 1/2 hours with the final episode being about ten minute long. The seven episodes are:

1) Zombie Harvest- Zombies at a farm with a soldier performing narration like he was doing a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation. Episode creates soldier is an unthinking zombie metaphor.
2) Skin of Your Teeth- Zombies at a farm. No soldiers.
3) Zomblies- Zombies and soldiers. No farm.
4) It Came from out West -Zombies out west. Puppets and anachronisms galore.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. 1 sex scene in first episode. No nudity.
5) Paris by Night of the Living Dead- French grindhouse style. No translation. Not much spoken.
6) Savages- Indian(?) zombie film. 4 teens camping in woods. None are girls.
7) Dead Hungry- Cute little FILM.  zombie in woods looking for brains.",1385078400,,949,4.698795180722891
8559911,4,B00AZULEAA,"Not all collections are perfect so neither is this one.  What is great is the collection of short films, though the feature is pretty good as well.  Many of these films show up on Youtube or some other site and can be difficult to find if you don't know how to make your way through the search lists.  So, finding a collection of the shorts is very cool and provides attractive artwork on the cases.  Both volumes of Feast should be in your zombie film collection.  I hope the company continues to produce future volumes full of the hard to find shorts.

A good place to view some of these is on the the Shorts films channel.  It is available on DirectTV and other outlets.",1376092800,,673,4.336
8559912,5,B00AZULEAA,"We meet Mike, a man in love with a girl who he's going to propose to that night over dinner.  But on his way home, Mike is met with a horrible twist of fate, when Dr. Faust claims yet another victim in his hit-and-run scheme to collect bodies for his experiments.  After injecting him with a serum to reanimate the dead, Mike makes a break from his captor.

Mike runs into various criminals and seedy members of society, saving the day the best way a zombie can.  But his inner lust to feed upon his criminal prey and create additional zombies is the inner demon he fights with.  It's during one of these moments of weakness that he is confronted by The Bum Master, a man who helps train him to harness his zombie abilities to fight crime and suppress his undead biology.

Between drug dealers, car jackers, pimps, kidnappers, a golem, a man in black referred to as 'Agent X', Dr. Faust, and his own inner demon, zombie Mike has a lot on his plate to overcome and become The Zombie Hero!

I've had the opportunity to meet Nick Jackson, the director/writer/actor of The Zombie Hero.  Hearing all the production details of what he himself had to go through and deal with made me admire the final product of The Zombie Hero all the more intriguing to me.  Definitely worth adding to one's own personal library of horror flicks.  Overall, The Zombie Hero is a fun movie.  Director Nicholas A. Jackson is a director to watch for and I can't wait for the sequel!",1282867200,2,1456,4.456603773584906
8559913,5,B00AZULEAA,"I caught this movie over the weekend at the Fright Night Film Fest and had to buy a copy of it!  The writing, acting, directing and editing are solid.  I look forward to future projects from Nicholas A. Jackson!",1280707200,2,211,4.384615384615385
8559914,4,B00AZULEAA,"The Zombie Hero is the movie James Cameron WISHES Avatar could be!  Great performances all around!!  Good, campy B-movie fun!  Everyone involved should be proud of the finished body of work they all created.",1266537600,2,207,5.029411764705882
8559915,5,B00AZULEAA,"This is a humble but honest and entertaining debut by up-and-coming Wisconsin-based director Nicholas A. Jackson. Jackson and his production house, Digital Mad Movies, bill themselves as ""no-budget film making"" and are very creative when it comes to special effects, cinematography, and props. The director certainly has chops and given the right backing, could eventually blossom into an award-winning filmmaker. Any movie aficionado that has seen Peter Jackson's or Sam Raimi's early work will instantly recognize this as an excellent first foray into the realm of movie-making.",1266364800,3,580,5.67816091954023
8559916,5,B00AZULEAA,"I know way too many people that take their zombie movies too seriously. Come on people! Zombies are funny!
This film brings to mind the classic Troma films of the 80's! I thought it was fun and creepy and I definitely do not think it's a waste of money! If you like a little humor with your horror, buy it!

Plus, if you supposedly worked on the film and have issues, taking it out in a public forum is really mature. Way to go, very classy!",1266364800,3,441,4.127906976744186
