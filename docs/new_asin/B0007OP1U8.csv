For all my Dwight Frye fans out there: He plays a character named Speavy, whos *technically* a bad guy (of course), but this role is significant in the fact that he plays his own mad scientist and not a lackey (unless you count the main villain, which youll have to watch to find out more about ;) )

The rest of the film is mindless entertainment, as per most B-movie Poverty Row films of the era, but I truly love it. The print leaves a bit to be desired, but Im sure they did the best with what they had on hand.

For only a few dollars, you get a cheap, fun movie to watch on a rainy day, a film to complete your Frye collection, and a cool case with a Canadian Mountie and an old scientist on it. What more could you want?",1528675200,,948,3.9528795811518322
