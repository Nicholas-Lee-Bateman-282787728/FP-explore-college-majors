Hay una nueva coleccion de BCG2040 con mejores graficos y muchisimo mejor audio, pero sin el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol. Si quieres o necesitas el doblaje en espa&ntilde;ol, esta es la coleccion que debes comprar.

ENGLISH HERE:
About the items: If you are buying this in 2017 (or later) you already know all there is to know about BCG2040. I'll be a nice addition to your collection, or to scratch your nostalgia itch.

This collection is inconsistent in the DVD menu, and the chapter divisions may be better, but otherwise, is ok, on par with (or slightly better than) the BGC2040 you remember watching on a CRT TV in the late '90s

*** Two words of advice. ***

1.) There is a newer version of this collection, with slightly improved graphics, and massively improved sound (from 2.1 to 5.1). Unless you are a Packrat, the new collection is the safer bet.

2.) BUT, the new collection DOES NOT HAVE a Spanish dub. If you want/need the SPANISH dub, this is the collection you want!!!!.",1493251200,,1023,4.661111111111111
7932149,5,B000056MM9,"In the year 2040, Tokyo is booming again after the great earthquake. Humanoid machines called boomers have rebuilt the city and it's better than ever. Except for 1 little detail. Some of the boomers go out of control and attack people. Along with the A.D. Police, the Knight Sabers are a vigilante group that destroy the rogue boomers. What these 5 women are doing is noble, but the police don't like having their toes stepped on. Despite that, the Knight Sabers are the best equipped to deal with the problem. They don't have any idea that a sinister plot is in the works. A plot so devious, that maybe even they won't be able to save the planet.

Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 300 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.",1354060800,,1074,4.507692307692308
7932150,4,B000056MM9,"Volume Three is a distinct improvement over volume two.  ""Leviathans"" has more action, more plot progression, and more character development.  Some secrets are revealed, one about Nigel and one about Mackey; but I won't spoil them.  Romantic tension builds between Nene and Mackey.  It's cute, you know?  I hope it can work out for them!  I will not forgive the series creators if they just let Nene and Mackey's interest in each other drop.

Nene is getting on Priss' nerves because Nene is being reckless during battles.  Priss even asks Sylia to let Nene go!  Wow, that is gall.  You will have to watch to see what happens.  In a more introspective moment, Lina returns to her hometown in the country, where she has an arranged date with a surprisingly handsome and understanding young man.  Again, I hope to see more of these two together.

Genom is messing with both military and bio-mechanics in this volume.  There is a huge, disturbing creature eating Boomers that do work deep underground.  And a huge military Boomer wreaks havoc in the city.  With the appearances of these two Leviathans, Leon and his partner Daley begin to suspect something is up with Genom - and they take investigative steps.  Will discovery of the Knight Sabers' identities be far behind?

This DVD has four episodes, #9-12.  They are:

9. My Nation Underground

10. Woke Up With a Monster

11. Sheer Heart Attack

12. Made in Japan

As far as extras, there are none.  It is disappointing to see that there are only three character profiles in the ""extras.""",1103673600,,1540,4.76425855513308
7932151,5,B000056MM9,"This third installment is easily my favorite so far. Finally, we are delivered the thing that makes a good series - character development.
There's plenty of it, too. Not to mention plenty of action. The main characters we explore here are Nene and Linna. Nene's place on the team has been questioned before, but now it gets serious as Nene faces being kicked out of the Knight Sabers. This excellent two-parter left me feeling extremely satisfied - it's about time Nene was in the spotlight.
The other two episodes are another two-parter, this time about Linna as she visits her family and must make an important choice. While I find Linna kinda boring, I still enjoyed these episodes, because we finally learn more about her. The military boomer fight was pretty good, too.
The show gets deeper as its characters get deeper and its mysteries get more intruiging. This volume was the hook for me; I NEEDED the next volume. Excellent and very addictive.",1069286400,,952,4.810975609756097
7932152,4,B000056MM9,"Pretty cool, the world could use some more cyber punk epics like this one. The english dub's pretty good but I recommend listening to it in japanese at least once later on, it's just better that way man!
My sole complaint for the series is the lack of action. The fight scene on the first disc ""Genesis"" kicks extreme robotic keester, but it never follows up with more. Not to the same degree anyway. This would be everyone's favorite dvd set if they had just made the fight scenes a little more interesting.
It's a fun series anyway, with likeable characters and an exciting concept... though I wonder if the original is better...? (This is a remake of an older, eight episode series named Bubblegum Crisis)",1020729600,,708,4.626984126984127
7932153,5,B000056MM9,"This DVD (of the series) is probably the best one (which I've seen).  ++++WARNING SPOILER++++ It all starts when a monster has appeared in the 28th ward of Megalo City.  This monster was a experiment from Bioscape Facilities, and now Voomers have seem to disappear.  Meanwhile after the incident with the monster, Linna visits her parents in the country-side.  Though at the same time her parents planned a set-up to get married. Priss eventually also is fighting a Giant Voomer by herself, Nene is on first shift at work, and Sylia can't come through to the incident where Priss is since the AD Police will not allow her.  This DVD leaves you hanging off the seat.  Enjoy the DVD if you get to buy it!",993859200,,702,4.576
7932154,1,B000056MM9,"I can't hardly stand this dvd for one simple reason...it is boring.  I thought that the animation and concept were average, and the only thing the characters seem to do is talk.  When you finally do get to any action scenes, they look like something out of a bad Godzilla movie.  The only good thing I can say about this dvd is that the girlies are cute.  This could have been so much better if ADV had tried harder.",992476800,,416,4.227848101265823
7932155,5,B000056MM9,"i... like so many others enjoyed first version of bubblegum crisis...and upon viewing this version for the first time was initially disappointed,it was not the bubblegum crisis i was used to...but after watching it i noticed that it is the sameit just shows more of the behind the scenes lives of the knight sabers. except for the music i thouroghly enjoy this rendition more. where as the first series was dedicated to action this series is very charachter driven...allowing for the viewer to get to know a deeper side to the knightsabers. enjoy this for what it is and not what it is not.. ja mata tomodachi",981331200,,609,4.700934579439252
7932156,5,B000056MM9,"This is the third Bubblegum Crisis 2040 DVD, containing episodes 9 through 12.  This disc reaches the midpoint of the show, and everything is starting to come together here.  The individual, episodic stories of the previous discs have sketched in the details about the world, and now the major plotline is coming into focus: the earthquake which destroyed Tokyo buried many dangerous things, and a certain executive at Genom wants to find them for his own purposes.  The characters (who were at best unappealing in the first few episodes) start to have a nice chemistry at this point in the series.  These particular episodes are a mix of heavy combat (with rather large enemies) and character development--Nene must decide if she's up to the job of being a Knight Saber, and Linna must decide if she really wants it.  If BGC 2040 hadn't hooked you by the previous disc, this one will hook you, if you give it a chance.",981072000,,919,4.71875
7932157,4,B000056MM9,"This is a very decent anime, but if you are like me and remember the original ""Bubblegum Crisis"" series (and later, ""Bubblegum Crash""), that came out in the US way back in the mid-to-late eighties, you will see that this feature, as well as the other installments, was not made with the mood and spirit of the original cyberpunk classic. The opinion I have about this movie may have something to do with the fact that I do not like CG's  ""glossy"" enhancements that has become the norm in modern anime. But, all in all, if you are not as purist as I am, or have never seen a cool cyberpunk anime flick, this one will be a good one to start with.",980294400,,644,4.235772357723577
