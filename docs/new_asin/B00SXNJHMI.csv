6994352,5,B00SXNJHMI,"I saw this on ETV - an excellent documentary. Manning a Dragon Boat looks to be challenge enough. But these amazing people are also fighting against a most formidable foe - cancer. You learn though, through this story, that these folks don't let the disease define who they really are - tough-as-nails, fun-loving and happy individuals. Their story is told through top notch cinematography and production. Kudos!",1431388800,,412,5.164179104477612

Director Liz Oakley delivers a powerful message of hope for those battling cancer and demonstrates through the stories of survivors a rekindled spirit and determination to live life to the fullest.  This inspirational film moved an audience to action and while the credits were still rolling, a group of cancer survivors spearheaded the creation of DragonBoat Beaufort (www.dragonboatbeaufort.org).  This movie will ""Awaken the Dragon"" in all of us. Highly recommended.",1431388800,,586,5.790697674418604
