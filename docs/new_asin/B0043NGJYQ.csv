4257305,2,B0043NGJYQ,"Four 30-something friends go on their annual hunting trip. One is a public defender, one a womanizer who owns a tire shop, one owns a bar and one is working on a novel. This last one (Brandon Van Vliet) seems to have gone off the bend a bit. He's also the only competent actor in the film. The story is mercifully short and doesn't really get going until half way through. I suppose it deserves minor points for having a little tension near the end (which I can't really talk about), but really, this isn't any good.",1374278400,2,516,4.329896907216495
4257306,5,B0043NGJYQ,"This movie is a fun adventure of four best friends.  Brandon Van Vliet shows his chops as an acting pro, and the whole cast is great.  John Karsko is a writing mastermind!  I, love, Hunting Buddies!  Follow @RestHollywood on Twitter",1291334400,3,232,4.725
8415145,1,B0043NGJYQ,Bad acting.  Bad plot.  Stupid ending.,1524528000,,38,5.166666666666667
8415146,4,B0043NGJYQ,"Interesting story.  Independent Film.  Surprisingly, good movie with casting choices.",1524355200,,85,7.4
8415147,3,B0043NGJYQ,I actually confused it for the movie Huntin Buddies with Tom Lester and Tim Conway,1522886400,,82,4.533333333333333
8415148,1,B0043NGJYQ,"Why does this made-for- $1.52 ""movie"" look like it was made in 1981 using cameras borrowed from Wild Kingdom? That aesthetic aside, decent story made unwatchable by poor dialogue and amateurish acting.",1518739200,,201,5.3125
8415149,2,B0043NGJYQ,I'm halfway through this movie and nothing interesting has happened yet. I give up. Acting's okay but where's the story?,1516838400,,120,5.05
8415150,2,B0043NGJYQ,This was a good movie until the very end when it went off the rails. I'm a great lover of twists but there was no explanation for the one at the end of this movie. With a filling in of the blank this movie could get 3 stars from me.,1514937600,,232,3.66
8415151,1,B0043NGJYQ,this movie sucks period.,1506556800,,24,5.25
8415152,5,B0043NGJYQ,Fun independent movie! Clearly a low budget film but don't let that take away from a decent story. Worth a watch in my opinion.,1456531200,,127,4.333333333333333
8415153,2,B0043NGJYQ,A story that could have been good. I loved the winter setting with realistic looking sets. The story was not good. I do not know what else to say.,1390435200,,146,4.068965517241379
8415154,1,B0043NGJYQ,"This is a really bad movie. Four guys, who grew up together in a small northern town, reunite every year for a hunting weekend. They are still best buds, although each has gone his separate way in life - one is a writer, one runs the local bar, one is a public defender and one runs a tire store. Then something terrible happens. But you never know why. There's no motivation, no nothing, no hint, no clue, nada. And then the movie ends. A number of other characters are introduced - the big-city policewoman who's seen too much violence, a local who may or may not have murdered his father, a disgruntled deputy... But why? How do any of their stories contribute to or advance the main story? All in all, a pointless muddle.",1374451200,5,725,4.417910447761194
