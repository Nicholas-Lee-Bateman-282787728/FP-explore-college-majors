4310253,2,B004AOECYM,"I do not remember how old this film is but the quality of the filming and especially the sound are not that great.
Pity, as this woman deserves the BEST quality possible. There is so much to say about what Mother T did that you would need a whole TV series.
if you cannot find anything else then it is worth getting. If you are after a quality documentary then you may be disappointed. I just wanted something on Mother T. not about her life but an interview.
do some research on YouTube and  you will find better footage.
Said this her greatness is so big that no footage could do her justice.",1367107200,3,594,4.256637168141593
4310254,4,B004AOECYM,"This was really put together well - but the sound quality on Mother Teresa's interviews was not that great. I would suggest that they put more subtitles in so that it is easier to understand what she was saying. The parts where the narrator was talking were super loud - and clear. Good content and tribute to a fantastic woman,",1366675200,7,328,4.483333333333333

4310257,5,B004AOECYM,"On of the most beautiful DVD's I have seen on Mother Theresa.  Not only did it include the interview with Mother Theresa, but it also included footage of many of the ministries that she established as well as the laypeople and religious who are carrying on her work. I would strongly recommend it to any one who loves or just wants to know more about Mother Theresa and her life's work.",1361750400,13,386,4.436619718309859
