6231395,5,B00HW2PS7E,"For a while Sid the Science Kid was the only show Savannah would watch on PBS Kids each day.  And, the few DVDs we had of the show were always on constant replay on the television. But then, the girls got hooked on animated movies with catchy songs that Sid was no longer a priority for him.  I have to say, I was a little sad to see them stop watching this educational show.  Not only was the songs Sid and the others sang catchy, but the story lines were always interesting and taught valuable life lessons.  I loved seeing Sid question the ""Why?"" of things, and then have his parents or a day at school answer his questions.  My girls really did learn a lot with this hit animated series, which still airs on PBS Kids.

Thanks to the folks at NCircle Enertainment for sending this new release a couple of weeks ago, as they have gotten Savannah and Bella excited about watching Sid and his friends again, and learning new things.  Even though we have only had this DVD for a short time, the girls have watched the 4 full-length episodes over a dozen times.  When we head out for a day trip, the girls are always asking to bring this DVD along to watch, and after lunch, we can't go a day without watching a couple of the episodes, if not the entire DVD.

The episodes that make up this DVD are fun and will entertain even the youngest of viewers.  Fans of Sid the Science Kid will want to add this new DVD to their growing collection, while others not familiar or who had taken a break from the show like my girls, will welcome this new DVD, and fall in love with the lovable Sid, and his friends.

And, at only $9.99 for this new DVD release, you can't go wrong for the price.  By the time your kids are done watching it repeatedly, you will have gotten your monies worth and saved on rental fees. :-)

6231396,5,B00HW2PS7E,"Over the years I have watched my fair share of kids' shows and somehow this one just slipped through the cracks, so it was a refreshing opportunity for me to watch a new show with my son.

In this adorable show a young boy named Sid is curious as to how different things function and by asking questions to his mom, teacher, and school pals he learns how lungs, muscles, and the skeletal system works. Sid involves his friends from school in his quest to get answers to his questions and they test out theories and sing their way to solving their curiosity.

One of my son's favorite parts of the show is when the kids do the 'Laughter'noon Jokes where each of Sid's buddies takes a turn telling a silly joke about the topic of the current episode. My son kept repeating the jokes all evening and cracking himself up ;)",1402617600,,819,4.381578947368421

My Review:

 Sid the Science Kid is an all around favorite in our house. I will even admit to sitting down with my children just to watch and hopefully learn something new. When you pop a Sid the Science Kid DVD in, you can count on learning something new. It is a great educational tool to use for your children, as a homeschooling mom, I use these type of DVDs to re-enforce what we are already learning. This one, the latest in the series is all about  muscles, lungs, skeletons, and the brain.

 Sid is such a bright little boy and he definitely has the attention of all of his family members as he shares with them what he has learned lately on the science front. Learning that his brain controls many of his actions she begins to connect a physical action to a mental one.

The first episode I watched was the whale episode that discusses non standard measurement. Wow...perfect for classroom use! I love how with each episode, it gives the children (and adults) an easy way to experiment that episode's concept. The concepts are explained in detail on an appropriate level. The DVD itself came in great condition. Great series to introduce your child to scientific thinking!!!",1523750400,,505,5.096385542168675
