8201173,5,B000RKVQVK,"I purchased this DVD to use in a presentation to staff in a behavioral health setting to teach about trauma informed care. The dvd was very helpful in giving a picture of the results of sexual abuse and in demonstrating the effects and signs for which staff should be looking. It clearly demonstrated that this is something that crosses all boundaries, racial, age and social strata. The stories told were poignant and yet hopeful. It is something that I will be able to use with our Seeking Safety group for women, most of whom have experienced what these women are talking about. A very valuable tool that can be used in multiple settings.",1345420800,2,641,4.68141592920354
8201174,5,B000RKVQVK,I would recomend this DVD as a Licensed Therapist. This DVD is a wonderful documentary for anyone working in the sexual abuse field.  The DVD is a little out dated with the way the people are dressed but the material represented is amazing!  I have used this DVD in some family therapy sessions to show how sexual abuse can be past down to the next generation unless the cycle of abuse is stopped.,1317686400,,397,4.424657534246576
8201175,5,B000RKVQVK,I use this video as an educational tool for future counselors and when treating abusers.  Survivors of abuse share their stories of overcoming sexual abuse. These stories demonstrate the devastating impact of sexual abuse and also dispels some of the myths such as it does not happen in affluent families.,1316304000,4,305,5.1
