3903868,5,B002C68WNW,"This video is little over 90 minutes long and has high production value.  This also includes snippets of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard weighing in on the saga between the Catholic Church and its enemies throughout history.

This video is of the ""Facts behind the Movie"" genre.  They take a fairly in depth look at the Catholic Church and secret society's such as The Illuminati, The Freemasons and The Hashashin.

This video is very well done and a very interesting look at the facts that drive the Movie Angels and Demons. If you are fan of the Davinci Code, Angels and Demons and the History Channel then I believe you will like this video as well. 5 Stars.

  What was waiting behind every door? ""Make sure to close the
doors."" No, ""Make sure all the doors are closed."" Wouldn't want
anything jumping at us from the other side. Wouldn't want the devouring
beasts invading from across the veil, piercing the veil to wage war on
the human race. Disgraceful, the tasteless rP2 festering within
the belly of the beast as hunger.kether+malkav
  Thirst? Thirsty for blood? Thirsty for rust and dust, all kinds of empty dust sucked into the wind,
all kinds of nasty rust leaking into our water supply. Our pipes are old and need to be replaced.
  I realized the size of the thing when I took two steps back. When I took back a step, I was once
more overwhelmed by the size of the thing. Taking three steps backwards, a sensation of safety rushed over
me.
  Yesterday's trees smoked up the withered liver with alcohol. Lungs of iron tried the test to best
perform under implement conditions. No minions conducted the system reset.

3903870,5,B002C68WNW,"This is a really good documentary.  It gives actual historical facts to many parts of the movie.  It was so entertaining and interesting, that when this documentary was on TV I saw it three times!  I even called the network that aired the episode to try to find out how I could buy it.  They said it would eventually come out.  And, now I am glad that it is finally coming out on DVD.  I also can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD.",1254096000,22,437,4.023255813953488
8363195,5,B002C68WNW,"A look at real church history is always interesting.  When that history is also included into a movie it is like a deeper view into the past. This was that look into the past.  Christians of all faiths could learn a little something or a lot, depending on their willingness to accept facts and separate them from fiction. This movie, was very entertaining with a bit of both (fact and fiction) woven together to create a very good movie",1491004800,,436,4.506329113924051

8363202,3,B002C68WNW,"This documovie brings forward an arsenal of indications and clarifications
for anyone who is not versed in Catholicism.  I gave it a 3 star rating because
I was not interested much in the information given in this documovie.  Above
all, the main principle a viewer should keep in mind is that Angels and Demons
is extraordinary fiction trying to feign reality.  As such, it is an excellent production
and very entertaining.",1389484800,,423,4.929577464788732
8363203,3,B002C68WNW,"I have to admit, I was a little mislead by the product description of this item.  It was not at all what I was expecting but that is not to take away from the value of this DVD to fans of the DaVinci Code movies.  I would consider this more of a very extended movie trailer or behind the scenes with the actors/producers rather than a documentary in the sense of items it is advertised with.  It seems that a very large portion of this DVD is comprised of cut scenes from the movies discussed in it rather than any actual new or original material on the subject matter itself.  However, to be fair, I've tried watching it 3 or 4 times now and have never gotten through it all. This just was not the what I thought I was buying.  Movie buffs would probably love it, but if you're going more for the type of documentaries shown on the History Channel, Discovery, or the Science channel then you might be disappointed.",1383004800,,915,4.296511627906977
