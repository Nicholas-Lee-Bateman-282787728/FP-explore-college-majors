5277622,5,B00991164U,"I caught ""Sitting Target"" a few times on cable TV many years ago and have been looking for a DVD release ever since, so it is with great delight that I see Warners is producing this film as one of their made-on-demand discs. Very much a product of its time, ""Sitting Target"" is a brutal British thriller in which an imprisoned criminal (Oliver Reed) breaks out to kill his unfaithful wife (Jill St. John). Nasty in a very good way. I will be ordering this today!",1352764800,10,462,4.383720930232558
5277623,4,B00991164U,"Warner Archive has released MGM's 1972 British actioner, ""Sitting Target"" starring Oliver Reed and Ian McShane in a kind of buddy picture that suffers from a lack of morals as a lot of British films were prone to from the mid-sixties.  In Britain, unlike ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" the buddies eventually turn on one another as a twist.  Not very sporting.  And the violence ala Peter Collinson (this was after 1967's ""The Penthouse"" and 1969's ""The Italian Job"" and 1971's ""Fright"") is brought to the screen as directed by Douglas Hickox who had previously directed the film version of Joe Orton's comedy ""Entertaining Mr. Sloane"" and would later direct ""Theatre of Blood"" and ""Zulu Dawn.""  And as in Britain in 1971 when Sam Peckinpah delivered ""Straw Dogs"" we learned a lesson through the violence.  Here we only know that ""vengeance is the Lord's"" ultimately, and we knew that from the beginning, but wanted to sit through it.  Jill St. John, the leading lady who never really became an actress through the years is cast as Reed's faithless wife and object of his revenge, including a rather unconvincing and prolonged escape from prison.  It adds to the thrill factor that she has repeatedly been the dumb sexpot movie star on borrowed time (her British accent comes and goes) and she will get what she deservedly deserves.  The Warner Archive edition is in widescreen 16 x 9 and is in Metrocolor with outstanding music by Stanley Myers and features a TV spot trailer.  Well photographed by Ted Scaife.  The transfer is good and now what we expect from Warner Archive.  Hopefully they can release a flood of those quality pictures out there that have never been released on DVD or home video before.  Looking over the output lately, one has to be somewhat suspect of taking a chance on an unknown commodity.  This is good but a bit disturbing.  Probably more appealing now than when first released.  Supposedly in the ""Get Carter"" tradition.",1350345600,10,1957,4.834834834834835
8537756,5,B00991164U,"Oh dear. Ollie Reed's on the rampage. Again.
Concrete faced, Mauser-handed, with a cheating wife to slaughter and a previous blag's cash to collect, he's on a big, early 7o's, grue and grime ruthless mission.
After cracking a few heads in a grabbing jail-bust, career lag Ollie and slippery Ian MacShane (looking not a day over 15) hit the dirty capital streets with loot in their brains and violence in their hearts.
McShane's a smirking opportunist, but you can't help feeling sorry for Ollie's character: He's going to brutally murder his unfaithful wife, fair enough, but he's met with such trials and betrayals along the way, it's difficult not to be rooting for the glowering old spud.

Director Douglas Hickox keeps the whole unpleasant charade chugging along well. From the taut jail-break ~ where a police dog is bloodily bashed to death with a house-brick, and a semi-conscious guard has an Edgar Alan-full of urine poured on his face ~ to the final bone-crunching car chase and fiery climax, the whole piece is rendered with grit and gloom. It has a slightly art-house undertone which somehow heightens the murky drama. For example, the only sunlight seen in the film bathes Ollie in a kind of celestial brightness so you can hardly see him. This both harks back to his previous film, 'The Devils', where a flawed priest is persecuted by an even corrupter church/state; and forward to Hickox's next, the endearing 'Theatre of Blood', where another essentially honourable but flawed man is driven to madness and murder by the duplicitous actions of others.

If you're not an aficionado of Ollie-in-full-rage-mode (and why not, for pity's sake !?), you can spend the whole 1oo+ minutes of 'Sitting Target' spotting the endless cameos by fab Brit character actors : from chain-smoking Eastenders' to tragic Wicker men - and too many assorted others to mention.
The dubbed-on sound effects are great, too ~ Eerie metallic footsteps, jolting jail-door clangs and the echoey clicking of that fabulous Mauser ..

On it's own, the incredible sight of a purple-faced Ollie foaming at the mouth in a straight-jacket - a la the gay snog in 'Hired To Kill' - deems 'Sitting Target' a ludicrously easy 5 stars.",1509580800,,2208,4.946091644204852
8537757,5,B00991164U,"magnificent film, so underrated, can,t  believe hardly anybody knows about this gem, typical early 70,s british film reed and mcshane are the perfect partnership, great support cast too.",1461801600,,186,5.642857142857143

8537759,4,B00991164U,"Its strange that even with the huge revival in interest in British gangster movies in the late 90s, Douglas Hickoxs nihilist-to-the-max Sitting Target has never developed much of a reputation outside of a very, very small cult following you could probably fit in a bus shelter on a particularly quiet country lane. While its not in the same league as Get Carter or Performance, it is a terrific little thriller that may not add up to much but does what it does with a lot more style and intensity than youd expect, especially if you're familiar with the directors more conventional later films like Brannigan and Zulu Dawn. Here he brings an often strikingly imaginative visual sense to this defiantly amoral and unsentimental revenge thriller that sees Oliver Reeds brutish armed robber break out of prison with Ian McShane to kill his wife, Jill St. John (sporting an impressive but occasionally erratic English accent), after he finds out that she has taken up with another man and got pregnant. At times he pushes it a little too far into arthouse territory and it does suffer from some poor greenscreen work in some of the car scenes, but for the most part it makes a fairly simple plot come up surprisingly fresh, with the big central setpiece that sees Reed pursued through clotheslines by two motorcycle cops particularly memorable. Theres a decent supporting cast  a fairly restrained Freddie Jones, Frank Finlay, Tony Beckley, Robert Beatty, Randall and Hopkirk [Deceased]s Mike Pratt and even EastEnders Dot Cotton herself, June Brown, among them  but with the possible exception of Edward Woodwards underemployed cop assigned to protect St John, nobody is likeable and betrayal is the name of the game. Yet despite the lack of anyone to root for its a surprisingly gripping and effective thriller thats certainly ripe for discovery.",1403136000,2,1844,5.003257328990228
8537760,5,B00991164U,"Great film. Reminded me so much of Get Carter (1971) and Escape from Alcatraz (1979).
Only Brits, Americans, and Italians knew how to make a Crime-thriller back in the 1970's.
Simple story line, nothing too fancy in terms of shooting locations or action scenes, and yet the movie speaks loud and clear
to me.

Another plus was Oliver Reed...one of the coolest avant-garde actors from that decade.",1385424000,,396,4.91044776119403
8537761,5,B00991164U,"After experiencing Director Douglas Hickox's riveting revenge thriller 'SITTING TARGET'-1972, I sat back in my chair scratching my head trying to figure out why this film is completely overlooked and forgotten to this day.  British thrillers were sprouting up stateside few and far between during the late sixties/early seventies and critics were noticing the standouts such as Director Nicholas Roeg's 'PERFORMANCE'-1970 and Director Mike Hodges's 'GET CARTER'-1971.  Its inconceivable to me that this film was overlooked the way it was because it matches those titles plus any that followed afterward. It has outstanding performances by Oliver Reed (so intense that he almost shatters the camera lens) and Ian McShane (long before his turns on the TV series 'LOVEJOY ' and HBO's 'DEADWOOD'); a great jazzy score by Stanley Myers; beautiful photography by one of Britain's best Edward Scaife who also did Director Basil Dearden's 'KHARTOUM'-1966, Director Robert Aldrich's 'THE DIRTY DOZEN'-1967 and Director Burt Kennedy's masterpiece 'HANNIE CAULDER' -1971 among others; and rat-a-tat editing by future James Bond Director John  Glen. Reed is sentenced to a 15 year stretch but when his wife pulls a surprise visit confessing her infidelity and pregnancy (not his), he vows to kill both her and her beau, suffice it to say it is a great 93 minute roller coaster ride.  Along for the ride are cameos by Edward Woodward, Frank Finlay, Freddie Jones, and beautiful sixties model Jill Townsend.  The only thorn is actress Jill St. John who seems out of sorts and who's role should have been given to a British actress such as Susan George.  I am not knocking Jill's perf, it just doesn't fit this film.  Director Hickox would go on to direct one of Horror master Vincent Price's best films 'THEATRE OF BLOOD' the following year.  Warner Archive once again saves an excellent film from oblivion by presenting it it in a crisp 1.85 transfer with an original trailer its only extra.",1378684800,6,1978,5.12111801242236
8537762,5,B00991164U,"Oliver Reed and Jill St. John are part of the excellent cast in this movie resembling North American action and/or con flicks. This movie is gripping from the very start. You will feel like you are on a roller-coaster ride which provides excellent, fast-paced, and thrilling twists and turns! I strongly recommend it. I got my copy at Amazon.",1377907200,,342,4.813559322033898
8537763,5,B00991164U,"This is an under appreciated gem. The critics, wrong-headed as always, lambasted it when it was first released. For some reason, the popular consensus names the vastly overrated ""Get Carter"" as the crime classic from that era. But for my money ""Sitting Target"" blows it away. Oliver Reed is seriously bad ass in this,like a man possessed. His brooding presence hangs over every frame. His character is, on the surface, a malevolent brute, yet he managed to bring some depth to the part; I felt the sadness, the tragedy, when it all ended. His character did, after all, love his wife. Bravo.",1364256000,5,590,4.794117647058823
8537764,5,B00991164U,This is a brutal british mob actioner with the one and only Oliver Reed and Ian McShane. Intense escape scene in the beginning and action all the way.,1363910400,2,150,4.392857142857143
8537765,5,B00991164U,"With Harry Lomart Oliver Reed has added another indelible rogue to his illustrious catalogue.  Save Edward Woodward's Inspector Milton who is to ""protect"" Harry's cheating wife Pat(Jill St. John) Harry may be the noblest character in this violent piece.  Yes, he is volatile, brutal, and vicious but he has a certain moral code to which he abides and he doesn't take Pat's straying behavior lightly.  A telling scene is when a girlfriend(Jill Townsend) of an associate (Frank Findlay) offers herself to Harry and he politely declines.  The motives of his cellblock mate and partner in crime Birdy(Ian McShane) are a little less apparent.  This is a terrific crime thriller full of doublecrosses and hidden agendas that will keep you guessing the ultimate outcome.  Not of the calibre of Mike Hodges' ""Get Carter"", John MacKenzie's ""The Long Good Friday"", or Neil Jordan's ""Mona Lisa"" but a noble entry in the British cinematic crime canon.",1361059200,3,939,5.104575163398692
