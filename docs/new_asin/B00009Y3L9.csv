8279319,3,B00009Y3L9,"A crime ring led by corporate head Daidohji hires a hitman, Katsumura, to take out Rei, who has intercepted some information being delivered to them by one of their colleagues.
However, Rei is in a bit of a slump.  Not only does she shoot a criminal and leave him bleeding without killing him, she is haunted by the death of her father when she was a girl.  Her boss tells her that she needs to go after Daidohji and his gang.  ""Failure could mean the end of Division Zero.  Become a machine, or else you'll get yourself caught up.""  The translation's ""tangled up"" seems a better choice of words.
Rei runs into Katsumura and the two end up in bed.  Yet Katsumura, attracted to her even though he has a girlfriend, Tomomi, hesitates in killing her, which is professionally very bad for a hitman.  This puts him on very shaky ground with Daidohji, who demands him to get rid of Rei ASAP.
Rei too is hesitant, not only because of their encounter, but because of the traumatic memories of her father.  She's also burned out of killing, yet she tries to do it on her own terms.  Other times, she wishes she were dead.
The motion of the characters are kind of jerky in places, so it doesn't look like it was shot on film but rather some video camera.  And people who have movies distributed by Asia Pulp Cinema can discover where the theme music used in APC's preview for coming attractions came from--here.
There is a higher degree of action here, with a shootout scene in a maze of metal shelves akin to that of a Western.  In fact there is a bluesy harmonica that comes into play at times.  Another time, Rei spots Katsumura and says to herself, ""Doc Holliday.""
I've only seen the first three Zero Womans, this one included, but Kumiko Takeda is by far the sexiest Rei I've ever seen.  It's those pointed and pronounced eyebrows, plus those eyes that do it for me.  However, for a better quality movie with Takeda, check out Close Your Eyes And Hold Me.
With the Zero Woman series taken over by Asia Pulp Cinema, yes, there is more violence, blood, and sex than when ZW was distributed by Tokyo Shock.  However, it isn't made clear exactly what business Daidohji is into, and we never find out what causes Katsumura's bad dreams.  Also, the ending left me as disillusioned and angry as Rei, and for that I knock this down a star.  Worth as a time-killer and for looking at Kumiko Takeda.",1062115200,2,2384,4.456221198156682
