I felt that I was stepping over the same dangerous grounds with the troops and their courageous skillful photographers. It answers questions: where do  actual combat photos come from? Who took them? Yes, now the viewer will never watch news and war footage without considering how those pictures came about. The DVD Vietnamese War pictures are gripping and tension-packed. The wounds are depicted and ""there but for God go I,"" thought comes up again and again. Truthful, very emotional.",1424044800,,577,5.138297872340425
