1623685,5,B00005M1Z6,i love it the story line was exelent i have watched many anime and this one hit the top. the characters are great and asuka jr. so cute i really love it im getting the hole series,1010016000,,179,3.864864864864865
1623686,4,B00005M1Z6,"Okay....to be honest, as I should be this book wasn't bad.  After I was done reading I was interested enough to want to buy the 2nd one.  It left me feeling that it would grow over time, which it did on the 2nd one, cause now I'm hooked. Anyway, the chase that Asuka Jr. puts on for Saint Tail seems kind of dumb at first but then after awhile you hope that he does catch her so he can find out who she really is (which is his fellow classmate during the day).  The 1st one was okay because mostly it's just starting out and in my belief she's doing a lot of character building and other touch ups, it seems like it's going to be a cute series.  If you like cute, simple love story mangas and anime's this is a pretty good series to add to your collection.",1006300800,,756,4.02
1623687,4,B00005M1Z6,"Just recently I bought this at a store and it came with the first issue of the manga for free. So I'm thinking why not? Give it a chance.  So I read the Manga then I watched the first disk, and this is what I think.  I didn't think it was fantastic, but I did like it.  To me it seemed like a series that would grow over time and I think I'm right.  The anime was pretty accurate, at least to the english version of manga, and it made me want to get the second issue on both versions.  But if you want to know what I think of the second version your going to have to read that review, but anyway if you like shows like sailor moon and cardcaptor, I would have to say it's similar in it's own way.  It is pretty original, but I have to say some of the plot lines are pretty cheesy.  So I'm pretty sure your wondering what I did like about this series, well Duh!!! The Love story, to tell you the truth that's why I'm hooked.  It's so cute, but the thing is Meime who is also Saint Tail can't tell Asuka Jr. that she's in love with him because he doesn't know that she is Saint Tail, which if you ask me I think he's in love with Saint Tail without knowing that she's his fellow classmate at school during the day. I'm sure you can imagine being around the guy you love and he doesn't even know who you really are.  But if you are somewhat interested in watching this I would say go for, mostly just for the chase Asuka Jr puts on for Saint Tail, It makes me wish I was chased after like she is!!!!! A must have if you like cute simple anime!!!",1005609600,,1542,3.9483870967741934
1623688,3,B00005M1Z6,"the story is cute but it seemed like a very simple plot.  girl hears people's problems, tells friend, friend turns into a super hero and helps those people.  the english voice acting isn't bad, a lot better than other stuff i've heard (like ccs).  overall, i'd say a 3.",1005004800,,269,4.448979591836735
1623689,3,B00005M1Z6,"At first I really liked it...The subbed episodes were good. It would have been nice if the opening and ending themes where subbed as well...then I watched the dub. It was dubbing at it's worst. Not only were the voices quite horrible, but the script was almost completely different from the sub. It was as if the people who dubbed the first season of Sailor Moon had gotten their hands on another really good anime. I was absolutly horrified...",1004313600,,444,4.632911392405063
1623690,5,B00005M1Z6,"Following the tradition of cuteness with Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura/Cardcaptors, Saint Tail is wonderfully animated.  It's so cute, you fall in love with the characters right away.  I highly recommend this video!",1004054400,,219,5.606060606060606
1623691,3,B00005M1Z6,"I first saw Kaitou Saint Tail when it was broadcast on TV in Japan.  A friend of mine in Osaka mailed me video tapes of the first 12 episodes.  I also bought the Japanese laser disc of the first three episodes.  The first episode was a one-hour special with an extended version of the show's magnificiant end-credit song, ""Junshin"".  I was really looking forward to the DVD.
The song wasn't there.  TokyoPop decided to cut the credits out of the episodes, and ran the credits only prior to the first episode and after the last episode on the DVD.  And to top it off, not only did they not include the extended version of Junshin, they replaced the TV version of the song with an apparently synthesized instrumental version which was a far cry from Inoue Shouko's very wonderful rendition.  To top it off, the song wasn't found in the ""extras"" on the DVD.
Saint Tail is a wonderful show, and it really broke my heart to see it treated this way on a DVD.  I understand that TokyoPop has listened to customer feedback, and is going to do the second DVD right.  I hope so, because if they don't, I'm not sure there's going to be a third DVD.",1003536000,,1137,4.376190476190477
1623692,4,B00005M1Z6,"Saint Tail just so cute, it leaves me with Warm and Fuzzy Feelings all day.  The story is very interesting and original, and the characters are adorable!  I do have a couple complaints about the translation, though.  The prayers that Seira and Meimi say during her transformation have been cut in the dub, and there are no vocals during the dub opening.  Besides that, it's really cool!",999993600,,386,4.7164179104477615
1623693,5,B00005M1Z6,"Since Amazon has already given us a description, I won't mince words - Kaitou Saint Tail is an almost perfect show, with no empty plot holes or anything of the sort. They drop a major plot detail right away in episode one, seemingly leaving it open, but really, it is only waiting to show up again near the end of the show, in about episode 40 (three episodes away from the end!). The beginning only sets up the spectacular ending; although there are an unearthly amount of fillers, they all have the same, wonderful essence of Saint Tail. The first episodes all set up plots that will come together in the most perfect, fitting ways. Meimi and Asuka make the most darling couple - tearing out each other's hair and screaming at each other. This really is a *shoujo* anime, but I really think that if you don't like shoujo, that's not something that should mark 'Saint Tail' down. (After all, I don't usually like shonen anime, but that doesn't mean that they all stink.) Overall, Saint Tail is just a great anime that I adored to pieces (I frequently rewatch it). I only wish that more people knew about it!",999561600,,1108,4.517412935323383
1623694,5,B00005M1Z6,"I've read and watched Saint Tail, i like reading it better as you can use your imagination more but hte episodes are really good too. Saint Tail is about a girl named Meimi Haneoka and her friend Seria who is a nun-in-training. During the day Meimi is a regular school girl that goes to Saint paulia academy, But by night she turns into the mysterious thief Saint Tail!  but she just isn't any thief, she steals back items that were unjustly taken from their owners, Her friend Seria listend to peoples confessionals and tells Saint Tail what to steal and where. Saint Tail is pursued by a boy in her class named Asuka Jr.(who she likes) he wants to be a detective and is the son of a famous detective. Asuka Jr. challenges her and Saint Tail accepts, She then leaves clues for Askua about her next heist. want more? E-mail me!",997315200,,827,4.440789473684211
1623695,4,B00005M1Z6,"Saint Tail is an anime series dealing w/ the life of a small girl.  At day she is a nice sweet girl, but at night she turns into the mysterious theif Saint Tail.  Overall this dvd is good, but the actual show really is something that has to be an aquired taste.  Saint Tail isn't for everyone.  The show is a typical shoujo.  If Shoujo is your genre though still think it over, the show is cute, but it actually suffers from being too cute, and as prone to all shoujo the art quality suffers from lots and lots of replay scenes.",995673600,,528,4.137254901960785
7944546,5,B00005M1Z6,"Sega's take on the magical girl anime genre is undoubtedly the best. You've probably seen Card Captor Sakura and Sailor Moon, but Saint Tail AKA Meimi Haneoka puts all those other magical girls to shame. Her personality is much stronger than Serena's/Sailor Moon's, and her escapades with Asuka Jr. are full of both humor and intrigue. Sega does a masterful job of holding our interest in the series by setting two characters up for a romance and then frustrating that chance for happiness with everything that could possibly come between them. This series is a must-have if you are a true Sega fan! This DVD collection is the first of six and contains only the first three episodes:

Episode 1 - The Cutest Little Thief!
Saint Tail tracks a jewel thief and comes up against her classmate, Asuka Jr.!

Episode 2 - Wonderful Rival!
Saint Tail tries to get caught by her rival, Asuka Jr. Or is she playing a game of cat and mouse?

Episode 3 - Meimi's Love?!
How will Saint Tail keep her beloved new pet and still catch the bad guys?",1264204800,,1031,4.562162162162162
7944547,5,B00005M1Z6,"I picked volumes 1 and 2 up on a whim a couple of years ago for my birthday. I didn't really have high expectations for the series.
After watching this, I completely fell in love with the series. It's a cute, fun magical girl series with some romance!
If you like Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura, I highly recommend getting this, it's one of my faves!",1086480000,,353,4.363636363636363
7944548,5,B00005M1Z6,I don't have this one but the only saint tail dvd i have is the final collection. I got it for Xmas. This is a good series but hard to read subtitles. If you like sailor moon cardcaptor sakura like me then you'll love this.,1072828800,,223,3.977777777777778
7944549,4,B00005M1Z6,"As with the other two series that I also collect{SM and CCS}I wanted to buy the manga first. I didn't think this series would be that good, so I was a little hesitant. But as soon as I finished reading it, I wanted to get more. And I got all seven comics. But when I got the first anime video, big change.
For starters, there were more episodes in the comic than there were in the anime{only this movie}. And the episodes were totally switched around{ex: In the manga, Ruby doesn't come until comic 3, but in the anime, she comes in the last episode of this movie}. And there are also objects that aren't in the manga, but are in the anime, like St. Tail's brooch. However{this is the reason I'm giving this review four stars instead of five}, this movie is shorter than the others, and definately not as good, because it doesn't have the japanese language on it like the others{the theme song is in japanese with english subtitles, there's subtitles throughout the movie, but not the whole movie, and the ending theme is also in japanese with no english subtitles}, which I think would make the movie a million times better. After all{in my opinion}, the ending theme and beginning theme have just a bunch of pictures in it. But in japanese, I think it really means something.
I recommend this to people who are fans of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura",1067558400,,1354,4.508130081300813
7944550,5,B00005M1Z6,"I reccomend Saint Tail to anyone who likes a good shoujo. This is for children, and I reccomend it for children. It's a fun, heartwarming anime.",1031529600,,144,4.576923076923077
7944551,5,B00005M1Z6,Megumi Tachikawa made the cutest series ever called Saint Tail!,1028419200,,63,5.4
7944552,3,B00005M1Z6,"I bought the 1st DVD of Saint Tail, hoping that the great joy I found in the manga would translate well onto the anime. Unfourtanetly, despite the plot being almost identical, the charm of the manga was lost and all that was left was kiddie-fair. If you're still at the stage where the dub Sailor Moon keeps you happy for hours, this might be for you. But for everyone else, go buy the manga.
As for the dub... It's a shame the voice actors can't even pronounce the word ""Asuka."" If you thought Cartoon Network had some bad dubs, you haven't seen anything yet.",1026000000,,560,4.394230769230769
7944553,4,B00005M1Z6,"Saint Tail is an entertaining anime. It pulses with life and characters; however, it lacks originality. It basically fits the magical girl stereotypes: a high-pitched, sweet, easily angered girl who cries a lot; a boy who thinks that he hates this girl but underneath might not; and a whole lot of magic tossed in. All together, Saint Tail is worth your money as it is quite enjoyable and light-hearted.",1021680000,,403,4.855072463768116
