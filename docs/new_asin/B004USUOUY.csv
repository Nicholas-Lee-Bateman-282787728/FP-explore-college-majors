4470536,5,B004USUOUY,"The play upon which this film is based was a groundbreaking piece of work when it first came out and catapulted the playwright, Athol Fugard, to immediate international celebrity.  Lonny Price did a great job of adapting this to the screen, and the film should be seen by everyone, not just by loyal Fugard fans, because it's a reflection on a very important time in history.",1319587200,5,375,4.681818181818182

4470539,5,B004USUOUY,"Very well done movie. A must see for anyone that you can  not judge a ""race"" as a whole rather than forming an opinion based on the individual. Who your parents are or were simply does not matter. It is what a person can do, is willing to do, that counts.
Acting was great, good story, sad ending.",1428969600,3,297,4.120689655172414

4470541,5,B004USUOUY,"Freddie Highmore is on a trajectory of greatness!  I have seen everything this boy and now young adult has acted in.
This play is particularly difficult to watch, let alone play the major role in.
I have seen this with Matthew Broderick in it, BUT Freddie is now my favorite.",1417478400,,275,4.5

4470544,5,B004USUOUY,"This is a deeply moving, powerful movie; brilliantly presented.  No one who has not experienced apartheid first hand can fully appreciate the depth of authenticity portrayed.  I was living in Johannesburg (one of the privileged whites) at the time that provides the setting for this story (the 50's) and saw for myself the ugliness of that regime and the wicked indoctrination to which white children and young people were exposed.  I heard Dutch Reformed Ministers declare from their pulpits that the subjection and humiliation of the kaffirs was right and God-ordained.  I saw young people just like Harold and some considerably worse and Freddie Highmores portrayal is bang on and deserves an A with as many pluses as you care to add.  After watching this movie I had the strong sense of dj vu.  As for Sam and Willie, all I can say is that I know these men.  The realism in the dialogue, accent, costuming and characterization was for me unbelievably accurate.  The muted, understatement of the ugliness of apartheid is masterfully handled and the ending is nothing short of heart-rending.  One cannot conclude without mentioning the ""little boy"" Harold.  I saw him often on the streets of Rosettenville and recognised him right away.  If I could, I would give this one more than five stars.",1386288000,3,1295,4.921658986175115
4470545,1,B004USUOUY,"I bought this because I have five or six movies with Freddie Highmore but I was sorely disappointed.  This movie had no story, no plot, no moral. It was  boring diary during arpartide and there was no winners.",1386028800,,209,4.473684210526316
4470546,4,B004USUOUY,"Here's a wonderful film involving small incidents but really about big things. Based on Athol Fugard's play set in 1950s apartheid South Africa, the film focuses on the relationship between a middle class white family, especially the young son Hally, and two life-long black servants, Sam and Willie. Against the backdrop of a racism-based feudal system, ordinary individuals like Mom and Dad succumb to the lewd social conventions of a corrupt system while a select few, like Hally, dream of a better world. But when generations of the system's social conditioning threaten to corrupt even Hally's innate sense of right and wrong, he must make a momentous choice--a task a bit unfair for his young age--between allegiance to his enlightened sense of social justice (as well as to Sam and Willie) and the psychological temptations of the repressive and condescending attitudes of the morally bankrupt society around him. Fugard explores nothing less than human nature and the institutions humans create and the question of whether it is individuals or institutions that are evil. But rather than a scholarly tome on larger political and social ideas, ""Master Harold"" introduces us to anonymous characters and their ordinary day-to-day interactions to show us the insidious ways that generational and institutional racism, backed by the state and with an iron fist, reinforces and preserves itself by perverting the values of people, young and old, living within the institution. Fugard, at one time persecuted by his own South African Government, wants nevertheless to tell us that he's not given up on human nature, and that it is through the triumph of personal decency, learning, and self-respect that individuals begin to break the shackles of an immoral system. The theory though doesn't become a reality unless people believe in it, and Fugard's challenge is to make the viewer believe. This he does masterfully with Sam and the power of personal example. Though he's spent a lifetime in a system encouraging whites to unload their personal frustrations and resentments on unsuspecting and innocent blacks, it's Sam's commanding demeanor--forceful, eloquent, self-respecting, and forgiving--which convinces us that long-held attitudes and animosities can be changed IF an individual wants to change them. As for institutions, individuals create them. When individuals aspire to decency, their institutions follow--first comes personal growth, then social growth, then institutional reform. All wide-spread social reform starts as personal choice in our own backyard.  Agent changes structure. As Sam says, ""Without the dream we won't know what we're going for.""  When you see evil, you have to ""stand up and walk away from it.""  It's important to be reminded of that, especially in a modern world where leviathans dominate and individuals feel increasingly powerless.  Also check out 2006 Oscar winner ""Tsotsi,"" adapted from Fugard's novel of the same title.",1376265600,3,2964,5.409090909090909
4470547,4,B004USUOUY,"Great old movie, Freddie Highmore is a excellent actor, saw him on Bates Hotel, had to look up some of his movies.",1372204800,,114,4.2272727272727275
4470548,5,B004USUOUY,"The setting for this DVD is South Africa and Apartheid.  Although Apartheid is dismantled
in the country of South Africa, episodes in this DVD shall enhance appreciation for
the end of Apartheid.  However, there is another theme in this DVD which is worthy of equal
attention which is the hardships of a young white lad coming of age with a dysfunctional
parent - a father who is a chronic alcoholic.  Freddie Highmore, like other films, displays
the epitome of a superb actor who can adjust to any role, and, it is a heartbreaking one as
Master Harold. Despite berating incidents by his peers who use the excuse of an alcoholic
Father as a cloak for their jealousies of his exceptional achievements in school, Master Harold
continues to excel. The tragic ending is clear: In the Movie, there is one incident after another
in which an alcoholic Father publicly embarrassed Master Harold over the years. The Mother of
Master Harold repeatedly attempts to make the best of each incident.  At the ending of the
Movie, Master Harold vents his frustrations improperly on the Black employees. At the conclusion,
the viewer is left to wonder how present matters will be resolved as Master Harold rides away on his
bicycle to go home.  This is a very realistic portrayal of the strife with chronic alcoholism.
This is enhanced by the main actor, Freddie Highmore and the excellent performance by supporting
actors.",1369094400,,1406,4.890756302521009
4470549,5,B004USUOUY,"I have taught this play in a college classroom, and used an outdated VHS tape of an earlier production to have them see part of the play as it might look when performed. This video does a much better job of getting the themes and visuals across to a class. It's  very reasonable priced and was delivered in no time. A great buy.",1364428800,,328,4.2063492063492065

4470551,5,B004USUOUY,"To me, there is no play more genuine, nuanced.  It is genius.  One can see so much in this microcosm of the struggle of the ego and the soul in a complex snapshot of life.",1359158400,,171,3.857142857142857
4470552,5,B004USUOUY,"Not sure why there hasn't been more attention paid to this excellent film. It is a beautifully done movie of a vitally important theatrical masterpiece, created with great sensitivity and respect. For anyone interested in the work and life of Athol Fugard this is a must see. Stream it, rent it, buy it ... it needs to be seen.",1354320000,3,327,4.559322033898305
4470553,5,B004USUOUY,This is a powerful movie! I can't recomend it enough. The acting is superb and the message is overpowering! You won't be disapointed I asure you.,1349654400,,145,4.615384615384615
4470554,4,B004USUOUY,"When I first saw the play on stage, I found the pain and confrontation so awful that I couldn't look away.  I'd never found drama so emotionally stirring and welcomed a version filmed on a full movie set.  The additional scenes and the added characters (mother, father, and the classmates) were a plus.

The movie, however, bowdlerized both the F- and the N- word, which I thought was a mistake.  A play intended to be ugly shouldn't be cleaned up.",1323216000,2,448,4.5625
4470555,4,B004USUOUY,"I recently saw the stage play in San Francisco in an intimate 50-seat theatre, the perfect venue for the powerful 3-actor play.  The movie stays faithful to the play throughout, adding only some minimal scenes that fill in some of the back story contained in the play's dialogue.  Filming it on location in Cape Town was therefore a good idea to lend an air of authenticity.  The actors in this movie filling the play's roles of Hallie, Sam, and Willie are top-knotch, playing their roles with the required sensitivity. The movie lacks the power & punch of the stage play, which I think can only be properly conveyed from the stage, but it got as close as can be expected.  If you can't see the play, this movie is a reasonably good alternative.",1322006400,4,745,4.578947368421052
4470556,2,B004USUOUY,I was disappointed in the movie. The movie length was 83 minutes. The 1934 movie called No Greater Glory was only 73 minutes and was a little more complete than this one. I think that this movie should have been over 100 minutes in length just to tie up some loose ends. For instance I would of liked to have seen a little more of the father in this movie. There could of been a good prologue of the boys youth to introduce the rest of the movie. In all I think a fifty cent movie has been inflated to an amount of over Twenty dollars. Don't even buy this movie until you have at least rented this movie and judged for yourself whether it is worth the purchase. To sum up it would of been better had the script been expanded and altered for showing on a dvd or a movie screen.,1321401600,,776,4.078431372549019
8442160,5,B004USUOUY,Sweet story.  Teaches values in an honest way.  I love the movie.,1526515200,,65,4.333333333333333

8442164,5,B004USUOUY,This film uses many lines from the play so is a useful addition to studying it. Be aware it broadens out the play however adding characters to the original three and moving settings from the cafe to show apartheid in operation.,1494633600,,227,4.560975609756097
8442165,2,B004USUOUY,"When the movie arrived I was very expectant of learning new things about S. Africa and about the racial tensions of the era this takes place.  I was truly disappointed.  The cinematography was low budget (not that is a key factor in my review) but sometimes good cinematography improves your impression.  The prime setting is a cafe where Harold, a youth, is left alone for an afternoon with two black men who carry on with their practice of ballroom dancing rather than focusing on their job responsibilities.  The script was very weak.  The scenario of this little cafe requiring two employees when the owner is typically present at all times seems implausible.  The actors try very hard to convince you that the story line is not unreasonable.
The essence of the plot is that black men and women can not succeed in their jobs, they don't have access to careers but only servitude.  Thus, their happiness is found in their own community in which they compete for glory, in this instance ballroom dancing.  Meanwhile, Harold as a white has opportunities which are pretty limitless simply because he is white.  In the film, he decides to exert his power over the powerless as a compensation for his feelings of helplessness over his father's alcoholism and poor health and his mother's coldness and control.  These are powerful talking points and they have been addressed in other films with much more interesting scenarios and dialogue.  I felt like the writers assumed the viewers were so ignorant that they had to guide us by the hand to make their point.
When I read the reviews I had a much higher opinion of what this movie offered.
Pass on this one and if you are still curious renting it is your best option.",1491177600,,1716,4.724832214765101
8442166,5,B004USUOUY,Very fine video of the play -- much better than the original video,1479513600,,66,4.153846153846154
8442167,1,B004USUOUY,"It would have been nice if it had closed captioning. Also, I think it's ridiculous to subscribe to Starz when I already subscribe to them through my cable company. I should have been able to watch it for free. I can't comment on the quality of the movie since I couldn't hear it very well. Maybe I should just cancel starz through my cable provider. Who needs 'em?",1463270400,,364,4.367647058823529
8442168,5,B004USUOUY,"A truly great work that reflects the complicated world that Apartheid created. Athol Fugard's works had a wonderful sense of the absurd, with a passion for humanity denied.",1459209600,,172,5.178571428571429
