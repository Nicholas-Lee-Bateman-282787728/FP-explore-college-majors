8245830,5,B0012GM6D0,This Thomas Kinkade dvd really is beautiful and really touches you inside. Beautiful cards but I just wish the Garden Tomb had been in the set since I feel it was the most important one. But this whole dvd was wonderful. It really touches your heart. The tin it comes in is beatiful beyond words. Well worth the price if not more. 9 big beautiful cards but than I don't have to tell you how great Mr. Kinkades paintings and copies are. A beautiful booklet telling you about the paintings and where he painted each one. Well worth the money. I really hope he does more like this one.,1305849600,2,582,4.348623853211009
8245831,5,B0012GM6D0,"This combination of DVD, large postcards, and booklet, all cleverly packaged in a lovely tin, is a fantastic journey of the Holy Land as viewed through the eyes of ""America's Artist,"" Thomas Kinkade, a master of the ""plein air"" technique. We travel with him to 9 famous sites, starting with ""Jerusalem Sunset,"" viewed from the Mount of Olives. It continues with ""Sunset, Sea of Galilee,"" ""Mount Arbel,"" ""Caesarea,"" ""Garden of Gethsemane,"" ""The Garden Tomb,"" ""Via Dolorosa,"" ""Tower of David,"" and ""The Wailing Wall.""

It is fascinating to see Kinkade's easel set-up, and his technique, as he paints some of the best work of his immensely popular and lengthy career. The print sizes given in the booklet are much larger than the originals, which seem to be in the 8 x 10 and 11 x 14 range. One of my favorite pieces, the ""Tower of David,"" was painted on a piece of packing crate bought off a street vendor, and is approximately 12 x 16, because the vista required a bigger ""canvas"" than Kinkade had with him. Primed with hairspray, it is marvelous to see a master at work on this piece of rough wood, such a contrast from artists who fuss about ""surfaces"" and ""north light"" and so many other things of no real consequence.

While Kinkade paints, we get the historical aspect of the places from Claire Pfann of the University of the Holy Land in Jerusalem (one sequence is with Stephen Pfann of the same university). Pfann is attractive and knowledgeable, and adds much to the content and enjoyment of this DVD. Also excellent is the background music, which blends in well with what is being shown.

The 5  x 7  cards that come in this package are wonderful. There are 9 cards, but instead of ""The Garden Tomb,"" there is an exquisite nighttime portrait of Jesus viewing Jerusalem, titled ""A Prayer for Peace."" This one is so special I immediately put it in a frame. An interesting ""special feature"" is of Kinkade laying the pieces he has done side by side on a table and talking about them. He seems unaffected by his enormous fame, and very aware that his gift comes from God.

This is a superb gift package for anyone interested in art and the Holy Land. As a Christian artist, I was overjoyed to receive it, and will thank the giver for his generosity and thoughtfulness for years to come, because this 90 minute DVD is one I will enjoy many times, as an inspiration for my work, and to view the places where my Lord and Savior once walked.",1212624000,8,2440,4.584862385321101
