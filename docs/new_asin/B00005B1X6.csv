1420721,1,B00005B1X6,"Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story is nothing short of horrible.  It supposedly provides us a biographical look at the life, career, and death of the great Bruce Lee, yet half the time it doesn't even seem to have anything to do with him.  I could not make heads or tails out of anything this ""mockumentary"" related, and what little light it does shine on the man is rather unfavorable.  This story says absolutely nothing about Lee's fighting style, his personal philosophy, or anything else.  After a few scenes from an early film or two in Hong Kong, no specific film is ever even mentioned; thus, nothing is revealed about the entertainment side of Lee's life and career.  I was never sure who the business associates that plod through the story actually were; I'm not even sure how many of the ""facts"" presented here are actually even remotely true.  And don't get me started on the dubbing.  This feature has the worst dubbing I have ever heard in my life.  The actors themselves look pretty untalented going about the motions onscreen, but the dubbing is atrocious.  It is as if the speakers can read English words but have no comprehension of the meaning of any single one of them,  and a couple of the voice actors scream every single one of their lines.  In all honesty, I can't name one good thing about Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story.  It is uninformative to the Bruce Lee novice and anathema to the Bruce Lee fan.",1065052800,,1412,4.559523809523809
1420722,1,B00005B1X6,"I don't think so! What is it about these types of pseudo-documentary releases that the manufacturers think that they can throw a ""cool""(?) sounding name and some flashy pictures on the cover and fool us into buying this tripe? Poor Bruce Lee would be spinning in his grave (If he's really dead that is!), at the thought of his life being exploited in this way! Certainly many superstars and celebreties have had lame ""tributes"" released in their names but surely poor Mr Lee has to be the most sinned against! This release being an example of such! How many times can the limited footage be re-hashed and recycled in such a frustrating way???? Theres nothing new here, no insights, no revelations, no interest! If you want to know Bruce Lee, watch his movies. For more, watch the movie he wanted to, but never got the chance to make.... ""The Magic Flute"" starring David Carradine (who also robbed him of ""HIS"" series ""Kung Fu"") Or just watch ""Dragon- The Bruce Lee Story"" for the basic outline followed by a better and more enlightening documentary, ""Death By Misadventure"" which as a bonus also includes a look at his son, Brandon and his brief but worthy career! Steer clear of this twaddle. Its cheap because its ""CHEAP""!!!!!",990489600,13,1228,4.742990654205608
7936592,5,B00005B1X6,"The man martial-arts filmmakers could never let go! How many Bruce Lee ""wannabes"" have there been? This time around Bruce LI explodes onto the screen portraying, who else, BRUCE (not Lee, nor Li, just Bruce)! Sure there have been many to copy the frenetic and amazing Bruce Lee - few have succeeded, many have failed. In ""Bruce Lee's Secret"" (as it was titled when I saw it), at least the director(s) had the sense to make it about the fighting; the more involved, the better! Bruce Li is a waiter in San Francisco, minding his own business, when, out of nowhere, American kung fu thugs want to make trouble for Li and friends. Who cares - watch this one for the plentiful martial arts action. If you are a fan of the bad dubbing found in most of these films, you will get a 'kick' out of the insanely poor vocal choices. Lots of action, lots of fun - just enjoy!",1525219200,,863,4.366459627329193

7936595,1,B00005B1X6,"Bruce Li returns for another crappy, hilarious, incoherent, and completely inaccurate tale about Bruce Lee's life and death. The movie tries really hard to be an accurate biographical story; but fails miserably. First of the acting is horrible, the editing as well and the fight scenes... Well... I guess they are okay but I have seen much better. The editing is so laughably bad. There are moments were you just have to laugh because its so badly put together. For example the beginning where we see Bruce handing out news papers, out of nowhere it jumps to a ludicrous fight scene that is badly choreographed. Also they put Bruce Lee in this movie as an infidel husband to Linda Lee Caldwell. There are scenes where we hear Li mentioning that he is going to compete with other fighters, but it is never seen. We see him enter combat but he never fights, others do. The only thread of accuracy here is the fact that Bruce Li is seen preparing for the role of The Green Hornet. They demonstrate some tiny accuracy such as Bruce having migraines on set, and dying in his sleep. But these accuracies are presented in the most laughable manners. Such as the ending where we see Bruce once again being infidel to his wife, decides to leave his children and wife for some other women and in her house he lies down in bed and dies in a very funny way. This is not biography this is an insult to the man who reinvented the Martial Arts genre.

As for the picture quality I must say it looks really poor, it is watchable but very poor. The sound is average, mono sound.

7936598,2,B00005B1X6,"""Bruce Lee: A Dragon Story"" was probably the first of the phony, exploitative Bruce Lee biopics that came out shortly after his death. This one stars everyone's favourite Bruce Lee clone, Bruce Li. This mind-bogglingly innacurate movie pseudo-traces Bruce Lee's life from working in the United States on ""The Green Hornet"" to going back to Hong Kong to work for Golden Harvest Studios and director Lo Wei. These are about the only facts that it gets right, though, with Bruce Lee's alleged affair with Betty Ting Pei dominating the story (even going so far as to have Betty miscarry Bruce's child!). It blows big time, but honestly, it's good for a few unintentional laughs, particularly from the dubbing (listen to the director of the ""Green Hornet"" show - he's a riot) and parts of the melodramatic story. What few fight scenes there are aren't very impressive.
The DVD from Goodtimes has the obviously widescreen movie cropposed to full frame. It looks abominable, really faded with many scratches, but it's a budget disc that I found for $2 at Wal-Mart, so why should I complain?",1119657600,,1083,4.891304347826087
7936599,1,B00005B1X6,"Having watched this film from start to finish I am convinced that CD Now should give us the option of voting 0-1/2. Considering this ""MOCKUMENTARY"" isn't worth a whole paragraph...the whole movie can be summed up as follows: (1)The 1st fraction of the movie touches on Lee's college life, marriage, opening of a kung-fu school,and early film career, and (2) The rest of the movie is GARBAGE...Lee's pretty much portrayed as an infidel and emotionless adulterer who forsook his wife and kids to be with Betty Ting Pei and appeared to love her more than his own family. And the closing credits have Bety Ting Pei appearing to be the victim/widow as she walks alone on the beach. TRASH...a cruel joke. What's worst is the fact that Lee Roy Lung(Bruce Li) was supposed to have idolized Bruce Lee and wanted to carry on his legacy, yet he was a part of the TRASH! No love for this one.",1107043200,2,880,4.575949367088608
