7512840,5,B017RR68C2,Great documentary of a group of men in search of the Ark. It appears to have been done fairly scientific as to have everything properly documented if something is found. I don't think they are thru with their search as each trip is defined by the government of Turkey and the time frame given is not that long. Each year they collect more data to help narrow their search. The movie has some excellent history of the quest for Noah's Ark thru the years...  I found it very watchable and truly interesting.,1458259200,6,505,4.489130434782608

7512844,5,B017RR68C2,"one of the most comprehensive searches in video, for Noah's Ark I have ever seen.  very well done.  Very interesting to watch.  One thing they do not point out in the series, when talking about the Bible saying the Ark rested on Mt. Ararat, was that the Bible says it (ark) rested on the mountains (one of them, doesn't specify which).

But well done and interesting facts you did not know before the film.",1457568000,2,406,4.445945945945946

7512846,1,B017RR68C2,"...Self-proclaimed experts seek that which cannot be found. I wanted to like it, but I think your time would be better spent reading Ecclesiastes Chapter 1, which is what comes to mind.  Vanity, futility, it's all there.  This covers a few years of an ill-equipped team trying to find Noah's ark.  They make the climb sound as treacherous as an Everest expedition which is more than twice the elevation as Ararat.  There are a few interesting facts and graphics, but they don't make up for the drawn-out over-dramatized trip to the summit. Which begged the question why did they go to the summit if they thought the ark was at another location?",1457222400,5,644,4.723214285714286
7512847,2,B017RR68C2,"A self-indulgent documentary about a group of science-minded zealots who fail to find Noah's Ark on an ascent of Mount Ararat. It should be retitled ""Not Finding Noah."" The premise of the film appears to be one that preys upon the seed of faith in its target audience. One learns far more about the expedition's preparations and personal disappointments than about Noah and the ark. The film is noteworthy mainly for offering recent footage of the mountain, a general account of the political, bureaucratic, and safety issues surrounding a search expedition of this kind, and a light-speed survey of  the many previous accounts of discovering Noah's Ark.",1457222400,7,654,5.11214953271028

7512909,5,B017RR68C2,"I wish there were more movies like this. I loved every minute. For those who love adventure and mountaineering, watch this! My husband and I constantly search for movies where people display what it's like to have a real relationship with God. Oh. My. These are hard to find. This is a wonderful true story of real people, real faith, and real adventure ... on Mt. Ararat! Awesome! Great work on this!",1463529600,,401,4.583333333333333
7512910,5,B017RR68C2,"What an epic adventure! These guys, out of their own pocket, are seeking to find evidence of Noah's Ark. The amount of back story, intrigue, geopolitical challenges, lack of infrastructure, and just plain weather/nature challenges are more than most people would endure if they were getting paid to do it. These guys are accepting this challenge out of a deep love for God and a great friendship and respect for each other.
The challenge of finding evidence of the Ark may be more than they can overcome, but I think the adventure is still worth it for them. There was an old ad for a bus company (and I think a Harry Chapin song) once that said. ""It's got to be the going, not the getting there, that's good."" In the case of these guys, I hope that is so!
By the way, my favorite character in the movie is Cowboy. Watch his logistical skills and problem-solving ability. Inspirational!",1463270400,2,886,4.578616352201258

Other movies can show you actual pictures, animal hair, and more.

Others movies are even more science based with facts about findings too.

This is not  a made up movie but a factual presentation with actual explorers making the climb. Many of these men are on their first climb of a life time. Mt Ararat is also called the mountain of pain for a good reason. Not only is the one of the 10 most difficult mountains to climb but the most deadly . You have normal mountain hazards plus the PKK ISIS, & the Turkish Army to deal with (not explained in the movie).

7512951,3,B017RR68C2,"I was disappointed in this documentary because it was about a futile search.  The men involved in this film have been searching for years for Noah's Ark - to no avail.  They haven't found it.  And I didn't realize that when I bought the DVD or spent a tedious evening watching them search for it - only to be let down by the fact that they didn't find it.  I mean, who makes a documentary about finding something as significant as Noah's Ark...only to say, ""we haven't found it"" ???  I mean, I get it...the search was about seeking...and self-discovery...yada, yada, yada...but that's not what the title implies and it's not what I was expecting and not what I was interested in knowing about.  I believe the Ark exists, and I know others have found it, and I'm aware that Mt. Ararat is a difficult place to get to and the ark has never been easily found, so I was keenly interested in someone making the exploration and seeing the Ark when they found it.  But alas, this never happened in this documentary.  So I was disappointed to spend all that time watching a lot of repetitive footage of icy campers clamber up the snowy side of a mountain and camp and discuss their efforts, only to realize it didn't happen.  They should've titled it ""Searching for Noah's Ark"" because then we wouldn't expect them to FIND it, we'd wonder...did they?",1461024000,,1341,4.531120331950207
7512952,5,B017RR68C2,It definitely surpassed my expectations. Even though I didn't hike up the mountain I felt like somehow I was a part of their adventure. I loved the way they conducted their research and the end result was uplifting and encouraging. This was a movie not just serving of religious interests but rather the historian in all of us. Great movie and I look forward to any new research these guys do!,1461024000,,393,4.549295774647887
7512953,4,B017RR68C2,"Great movie.  I wasn't let down that they didn't find the ark yet because I had a personal conversation with one of the actors before the movie came out.  There's no doubt they are getting closer and even if it's never found, my faith that it really happened according to the Bible will never waver.",1460505600,,299,4.418181818181818
7512954,3,B017RR68C2,"I think this topic is absolutely fascinating. I was excited to see this film. But be forewarned, this is a frustrating style of editing. Intending to be fast paced, it is simply chaotic. They show a speaker state 2 to 3 sentences, then flash to another speaker for 2 to 3 sentences, then to another, following this pattern relentlessly. It got so redundant I timed the sequences to be sure I wasn't imagining something. They each last about 10 seconds on average. So the film is 10 seconds of an archeologist, flash to ten seconds of a geologist, then flash to 10 seconds of a mountain climber, zoom to ten seconds of a professor...As for the filming, it is beautiful, as are the graphics. But much gets lost as you work to piecemeal through the film zipping from speaker to speaker.",1460332800,3,783,4.560283687943262
7512955,1,B017RR68C2,"No wonder they didn't find the ark, after dismissing out of hand the work of Ron Wyatt. Such a waste of all their time and money. They don't even state why the ark must be on Mount Arrarat when the bible says mountains plural.",1459209600,,226,4.159090909090909
7512956,5,B017RR68C2,"I believe if you go into this film with an open mind it will help. I find this is to be the best docu-film I've seen so far on the subject matter. I truly felt I was on the journey with these men as they looked for Noah's Ark where they believe it to be.

I think that a balanced perspective is brought as they have guest commentary of different Christians, Muslims, Scholars and Scientists.

The film is beautifully shot and upscales perfectly on my HDTV. English subtitles are available.

I am not sure what some of other reviewers were expecting when the tag line ""An Adventure of Faith"" is clearly visible on the cover picture. Regardless, I believe this is worth a look and the concluding statements by the Scientist at the end show this film is not preachy.",1458432000,2,763,4.435714285714286

This is a homemade film that should be kept in the home of the people that climb the mountain for their own enjoyment.
Ron Wyatt's discovering of the ark which can be seen on YouTube for free obviously is Noah's Ark discovered and the film is 100 times better than this waste of time.",1498694400,2,349,4.223880597014926
