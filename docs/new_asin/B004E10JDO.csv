When it finally arrived today (well packaged), I popped it in my DVD player and it reads ""REGION ERROR - NOT APPROVED FOR PLAY IN YOUR REGION"".  NOT GOOD - NOT GOOD AT ALL.  I was completely caught off-guard by this and I'm out $25.00 and change. Everybody know you can't return this stuff once it's opened (and who's going to pay return postage to Italy anyway?)
