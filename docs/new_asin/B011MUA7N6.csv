7337606,5,B011MUA7N6,"Finally the complete collection of the Greatest Heroes of the Bible has come to DVD. This series, although, somewhat changing the details of the biblical accounts, presents them reverently, making good use of their low budget. They have notable names like Robert Culp, Robert Vaughn, John Saxon, Lew Ayres, and John Beck among their stars. I was surprised 35 years ago that prime time TV carried such a series, but the quality of the series indicates why. The Bible comes to life in this series.",1453852800,9,495,4.8352941176470585

8724725,3,B011MUA7N6,"Out of work actors from your favorite 1960's/1970's television shows do a Bible series. Some good moments of drama and some good chuckles as well. If you can buy actors from One Day At A Time, Welcome Back Kotter, Happy Days, The Addams Family, The Love Boat, Dallas, The Brady Bunch, Cagney and Lacey, Woody Allen's ""Play It Again, Sam"" and aging actors from Hiollywood's ""golden age"" doing a Bible series then this series is for you. The sets are cheesy and way too many blond-haired, blue eyed Swedish Hebrews on film.",1485043200,3,521,4.673913043478261

8724729,5,B011MUA7N6,Great classic from the 80's. I am so glad they remade it. Would recommend everyone to buy it.,1456963200,3,93,4.222222222222222
8724730,2,B011MUA7N6,The movie has lots of fake fight scenes and skips over some of the most important parts of the bible. Misses the point on so many bible stories. Very disappointing!,1456272000,3,164,4.5
