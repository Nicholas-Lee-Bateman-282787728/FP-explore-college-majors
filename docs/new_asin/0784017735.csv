174792,5,0784017735,"I like this video.  I am a beginner, and I like how she gives three different workouts that you can use.  They seem to go up in intensity, so the third one seems to be ""harder"".  I have no stomach muscles,  so I have to pick and choose among the exercises, but she gives  ""alternatives"" to make the exercises harder or easier.  Can't  wait to get the others!

174801,5,0784017735,"Denise Austin Hit the Spot Abs video is a total thirty-six minutes long and was released on August 17, 1995. The workout is broken into three segments. Segments one and two beginners will have no problem keeping up. Segment three is a different story altogether. Once she gets on the floor I found it very hard to keep up with her and it is more geared towards people who are intermediate and up. Here how the segments breaks down.

Segment One-eleven minutes

A workout mat and a folded towel are needed for Segment One. Denise starts out Segment One lying down with the towel placed under the lower buttocks. She begins the exercises with twenty alternating leg raises and then does nine sit ups with the arms straight out, eight sit ups with the arms crossed at the neck, and ten regular sit ups. Denise repeats the sit ups going four, four, and four for the three different sit ups. The towel is placed under the knees and does twenty-one reverse sit-ups. Denise brings the knees to the right side with the towel still under the knees and does sixteen crunches. The knees come to the left side and she does fifteen crunches. The towel is place in between the knees and she starts off with twelve pelvic tilts; then a sit up is combine with a pelvic tilt and Denise does sixteen of the combination. With the right foot on the left knee Denise does a criss cross of left elbow to right knee twelve times and then the left foot is on the right knee she does a criss cross of right elbow to left knee fifteen times. Denise ends Segment One sitting up and doing some alternating hand stretches.

Segment Two-ten minutes

A workout mat is needed for Segment Two. Denise starts the routine sitting on the mat and begins twelve back tilts; she then switches to where the back is on the floor and back up again for six times. Now lying on her back with the knees bent and the arms straight she does a number of little pulses; to fast to count. Now with the right foot on the left knee, and still lying on your back, she does nine knee\leg raises. She switches her legs and does nine on that side. Next come seventeen regular crunches and ten fast crunches. After that come a combo of crunches and knee\leg lefts; thirteen on the left and eleven on the right. Denise does something with her hands crossed and straight out and does thirty-one reaches to the right side and thirty-one on the left side. Denise then lies on the back with legs straight up and does twenty-two straight arm pulses\reaches. The knees are brought to the chest with the hands under the knees and she rocks herself eight times. Denise ends Segment Two with a back stretch, half-spinal twist done on both sides and two in & out exhales.

Segment Three-eleven minutes

Workout mat is needed for Segment Three. Denise starts Segment Three standing up with waist twists and switchers to fast, then normal, to twisting with arm punches and finally fast twists. Now with the arm stretch out she begins a series of moving the arms side t side. Then still with the arms straight out and moving side to side she does alternating waist touches. Denise then begins floor exercises. Lying on her back and knees bent she bring the knees in on her back and knees bent she bring the knees in and straight out twenty-two times. Then goes on and does an advanced modified version ten times. Sitting up and knees bent Denise moves the knee left right left and legs straight out and right left right and legs straight out. Denise repeats this several times. Now partially lying down she next does alternating in to out leg stretches. Later in that exercises arms are added. Denise then starts off doing arm curls and later adds back lifts to them. Denise next does alternating arm pulls. She ends Segment Three with thirty-one reverse sit ups with the feet crossed, with the legs straight up twelve sit ups, and the legs are still straight up for twenty-three footprints to the ceilings.

Having never heard of Denise, I bought the tape used.  I am so glad i did.  After about 2 months of doing 10 minutes every other day, I am 8 pounds lighter and my waistline is ""whittled.""  Even though the routines are only 10 minutes, you may be crying for mercy.  But Denise is very supportive, and I do not find her to be overly peppy.  The ""You did great, I'm proud of you!"" at the end of a work-out is a welcome encouragement.  Highly recommend.",1167782400,2,599,4.201754385964913
174809,4,0784017735,"I like how Denise Austin focuses on good form. She frequently reminds you to protect your back etc.

She is also very peppy and motivating, which some users will really like that they have a personal coach cheering them on; however, I personally was annoyed that she was talking so much.

This tape includes mostly standard ab exercises with some pilates-inspired moves.  The first two sections are appropriate for beginners because the motions are simple and not too fast; however, advanced users will find that the first two sections are not intense enough.  The third section is disproportionately more intense and the moves are faster, so it is more appropriate for intermediate-advanced.

While I would definitely recommend this tape to beginners, if you are looking for something more challenging or with more variety of moves, get the Firm Parts ""5 Day Abs"" and ""More 5-Day Abs"" instead...they each include five challenging ~8minute segments that you can do one at a time or in combo.

I can't remember the names of the moves, but here's a basic description of Denise Austin's workout:

Segment 1.  useless leg lifts,  lots of traditional crunches, reverse crunch, oblique crunch, pelvic lift with upper crunch, oblique twist

Segment 2.  lean back, pilates 100, single leg reverse crunch, crunch, combo crunch, side reach (like an oblique twist), crunch with legs up, rolling rocker.

Segment 3. twist body back and forth, reach side to side, double leg kicks, V sits to the side, single leg kick, crunches, revese crunches, upper crunch, lower ab lift",1162598400,5,1560,5.05078125

Now, 6yrs later and 3 months postpartum with my third baby, I'm looking at the same screen and hoping that 'magic' will work again.  My tape is getting old old and I hope that I don't wear it out before I get back to my desired size.  Thanks Denise!",1161302400,3,445,4.176470588235294

The best thing about it is the three levels of ability: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. I'm usually comfortable switching daily for level 2 and 3. You can FEEL her working your LOWER abs, which is what all of us want to target!
Some people make the mistake and think that they have to do all 3 workouts at once. Unless you're super-advanced, that's not necessary. Just one 10 minute session is enough! Other people complain about Denise's perkiness. I find it encouraging and it really does help!!

If you're over-weight, like I am, they are pretty challenging and sometimes a bit too much.  While she keeps doing sets I just rest for a few and then join her when I can.  Eventually, you stop resting as much.  That's when it really gets fun!  Tomorrow will be the beginning of my third week and I've already lost over two inches in my belly button area.

I was very flabby in the mid section (and for a woman-me-who hasn't has ANY children) I needed to do  something about my poochy belly. This video will halp you to get stronger  abs and a more defined waist line. The first 10-minute workout is for  beginners (I suggest that you do this 10-minute workout for 2-weeks). The  second 10-minute workout is the those who have reached the  ""Intermediate"" level. This workout challenges the muscles of the  ENTIRE abdominals ( I suggest you do this workout for 2-weeks as well). The  third workout is for the more advanced. You can still do it if you're not  advanced, but it's a more challenging workout (I suggest that you do this  workout in 2-weeks as well). You can do which ever workout you like, no  matter which one you choose, you'll get a GREAT workout for those ABS!

I have been doing my own abs  exercies for over a year - not real good results, and as she states in this  video - you will see results in 6 weeks.  That is where I am at this point,  and waited to write this to see if it was true.  I enjoy this tape so much  I am doing it twice a day now.  I highly recommend this tape to anyone  wanting to tone up the abs and waist.  I do all three of the segments, as  she makes it fun, with very good directions, and tips. It has really helped  my self esteem, and my feelings about my body.  Thank you Denise!  So  wonderful to be getting back into shape. Go for it!",960336000,2,875,3.853107344632768
174825,5,0784017735,"Trust me, you will feel the burn after doing this one...  I started using it with my roommates, and it is great!  You can't talk yourself out of doing it because it is only 10 minutes.  After doing it regularly (and  seeing results), we stepped up to the second and third levels, sometimes  doing two together for a serious workout!  Denise has a great attitude (she  is so bubbly that she can make you laugh sometimes, which is hard to do  during an ab video), and she really shows you how to do the moves correctly  for maximum effectiveness.  You DON'T have to do 500 situps a night for  great abs-- you can let Denise Austin help you get them in 10 minutes a  day.  I run this tape into the ground and never get sick of it!",956016000,6,727,4.181159420289855

(My youngest is only 18 months.)  The sessions only last for  10 minutes, which even I can find time for.  You can definitely tell a  difference in only a week or two.  I recommend it to all of my friends.",955324800,6,357,4.101449275362318
174827,5,0784017735,"Before I purchased this video I was doing 150 situps a day.  After using this video 5 days a week for 3 weeks, I saw muscles appear in my stomach that I had never seen before.  It only takes 10 minutes a day to achieve a  great stomach and I wasted so much time doing all those situps with less  than half of the results I have received from this workout video.  My  husband has also received great results from this tape.  He was recently  diagnosed with diabetes and one of the most important steps in controlling  the disease is to have less fat around the abdomen area.  This tape really  ""hit the spot"".  He has had no glucose (sugar) problems in over 3  weeks--he has been using this tape for 3 1/2 weeks. Denise is a real life  and time saver. I absolutely recommend this video!",953078400,19,785,4.2517006802721085

After a week of using the video, I can say that I am *definitely*  feeling the burn, unlike when I use my ab roller or torso track!  Austin  can be a bit too perky but she definitely motivates and her chatter helps  the workout fly by.",951782400,3,382,4.385714285714286

7795416,4,0784017735,"This is an oldie-but-goodie that I'm happy to have back. The digital download is a re-release of a 90s video series, which will probably appeal most to those who enjoyed it back then (and shed a tear when their VCR ate it). Tried-and-true moves. Squats, lunges, leg lifts and encouragement with beach scenery.

Done all at once (all 3 sets in one workout) it's a good, challenging 30-minute buns workout for beginners.  Starts off easier and gets more intense - you'll be sweating a bit in the end - but IMO, it's not so intense you'll feel achy or shaky the next day.

Video quality is not exceptional, but the beautiful scenery sufficiently distracts and keeps you focused on the workout, and the colors are bright and cheery.  Happy to have this one.  It's a leg workout I actually enjoy doing.",1506297600,,797,4.624113475177305
