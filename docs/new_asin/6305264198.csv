7995143,5,6305264198,"I am an elementary school teach and I was looking for an exercise video to do in the classroom on rainy days, so I got the Silly Willy Workout.  My students loved it!  They worked off some excess energy from being inside all day and were reenergized to get back into their schoolwork.  Now they ask to do the Silly Willy Workout video for P.E. even when the weather is great outside!!",1173744000,2,384,4.305555555555555
