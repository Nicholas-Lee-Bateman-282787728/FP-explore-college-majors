8757649,1,B01E4ZN32S,"I knew what I was getting into when i pressed play but nothing could prepare me for the absolute devastation that was this movie. It was in 4:3 aspect ratio and was black and white, which took me off guard because it said it was a 2016 film. There was an annoying flashing white circle on the upper right corner of the screen like someone was using the film tape as a coaster ""which would give me more use than the movie itself did."" I have seen better acting/writing/horror in a scooby doo episode. For those who like bad movies for a good laugh, this is not what you want the only reason for you to watch this movie is because you like the punishing aspect of life. If you want to waste a better hour and ten minutes of your life go stare at the sun.",1497830400,,752,4.122448979591836

8757654,1,B01E4ZN32S,"50s black and white labeled 2016.  Not classic in terms of the movie but a classic B movie good for the drive-ins of the era, I guess when the viewers were busy doing things other than watching the movie.  Not worth the money.",1464048000,,226,4.232558139534884
