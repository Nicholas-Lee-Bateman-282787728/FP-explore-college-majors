The detectives are dull and do not seem credible professional detectives - in fact, in most scenes they appear to have no emotions.  The story lines are far from interesting.  I watched all four episodes just because I had paid for the DVD, but unless you enjoy dull and gloomy series, please give this a miss.",1404864000,13,372,4.6923076923076925
6332320,3,B00J3M54AW,"This beautifully-filmed (wouldn't want to live there in the winter) series begins with a new Detective taking over the murder team in a sleepy, seaside town in Wales.  He has a photo of 2 young girls and there are intimations that these are his children from a failed marriage.  Nothing is ever said, but he spends the rest of the series with an amazing chip on his shoulder and a constant sullen look on his face.  Most of the stories are OK and the acting (barring the constantly moody Detective) is good, but the script lacks the usual British sharpness.  In the last story on this disc, the Detective's self-pity overlaps his professional judgment.  I won't be looking for the second series.",1404518400,6,695,4.663934426229508
6332321,5,B00J3M54AW,"HINTERLAND is the name of a new police procedural series filmed in Wales in both English and Welsh. The name is significant for a number of reasons. Often with police shows, the title is drawn from the name of the protagonist. This tells you that the show will be mostly about that individual. Murphy's Law, Taggart, Inspector Morse, etc. are but a few examples.

In other instances, the name of the show is drawn from the location, which suggests a strong emphasis on culture, background and characteristics of the area in question. Midsomer Murders comes to mind.

It is therefore a clue as to the style, tone and content of HINTERLAND, that it should be thus named. The word ""hinterland"" literally means ""the land behind"" and usually means a rural area. Interestingly, the word hinterland is also commonly applied in the United Kingdom to British politicians when referring to the depth, breadth and knowledge of other matters, specifically of cultural, academic, artistic, literary and scientific pursuits. It may also refer to their lack of knowledge of other matters. Apparently, this usage was used by British politicians in the context of the supposed lack of hinterland (i.e. ignorance) of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

Be that as it may, the title of this show suggests multiple possibilities as to its direction. Initially, in the first four episodes, there is less emphasis given to character development and more to the rural, isolated place that comprises the hinterland. And with two of the four episodes loosely based on Welsh legends, this reference to the hinterland as an isolated, multi-layered place is reinforced.

There is a Welsh word, hiraeth, that has no direct English translation, but it comes close to capturing the mood, the style, the tone of HINTERLAND. One attempt to define hiraeth is ""homesickness tinged with grief or sadness over the lost or departed. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire for the Wales of the past.

Protagonist DCI Tom Mathias fits this description in many ways. Mathias is a native hinterlander and his return to his roots, though not yet fully explained, suggests his strong connection with the land and culture in which he grew up. We do learn that he is a loner, recently returned from 10 years with London's Metropolitan Police, that he has a wife who will not return his calls and two children he is not allowed to see. Richard Harrington as Mathias conveys infinite sadness or ""hiraeth"" in his expressive eyes and is a compelling presence, although it must be said that watching him over the course of four episodes is as frustrating as it is absorbing. Series 2 will hopefully shed more light on his back story and motivations. Series 1 walks a very fine line between not knowing enough to care about the protagonist and knowing just enough to want to know more. Fortunately Mathias has a great team of three associates who have sharply defined characteristics and who make more of an immediate connection with the audience. This tips the scales in the show's favour. The behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast are helpful in this regard, too. With every new cop show there is always going to be a grace period where audiences have to get to know the main actors/characters. Mathias can afford to be somewhat mysterious so long as his team is more accessible and he is eventually ""explained"".

The mysteries themselves are good but the real star of the show is the hinterland itself. The Welsh countryside is stunning in its variety and beauty. As in the Irish series Single Handed, the land is an important part of each story. With HINTERLAND though, it is almost as if the hinterland is another character. The pacing of the show is deliberate, even slow in places, but the drama never lags. For fast-paced, action-oriented shows one will have to look elsewhere, probably to shows set in big cities, like New Tricks or Trial & Retribution. HINTERLAND carves out its own niche and has the confidence to draw its audience in using subtlety over suspense.

The fact the show is filmed in both English and Welsh (this release is the English only version) also suggests a confidence in the quality and content of the series. Given the opportunity, HINTERLAND could really develop into one of the most intriguing police shows on the air.",1404432000,8,4353,4.90625
6332322,2,B00J3M54AW,"I didn't like it because I couldn't see it!  Although the product details stated Hinterland had English subtitles, it had them only when Welsh was spoken.  Most of the film is in English, but since I am hard of hearing, I depend on English subtitles for everything I view.  Out of many dozens of DVDs I have ordered, this is the first DVD I have encountered whose product details were incorrect.

6332323,5,B00J3M54AW,"HINTERLAND, 2013. Series 1. This is a BBC Wales four-part crime drama television series set and largely filmed in the bleakly beautiful coastal town of Aberystwyth, Wales. Against  backdrops of the  city, mountainous terrain with remote close-knit villages, a seascape of windswept coastland, sand dunes. And the moors, which function as the badlands of the hinterland. The gritty noir police procedural that has been compared to BROADCHURCH  and THE FALL stars Richard Harrington, (LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD), as the intense and troubled DCI Tom Mathias, another flawed hero for our times.

What WALLANDER is to Sweden, and THE KILLING is to Denmark, HINTERLAND is to Wales: dark harrowing detective drama boasting compelling characters and suspenseful, multi-layered stories.  Harringtons DCI Tom Mathias is a brilliant, brooding loner, now on the run from his past after ten years with Londons Metropolitan Police.  Mali Harries (FOYLES WAR) is smart, hard-working DI Mared Rhys, a local girl who knows her land and people.  The boxed set contains four feature-length episodes on four DVDs, running about 398 minutes, with extras, totaling about  6  hrs. Interestingly enough, it was originally filmed in both English and Welsh.  Even the English-speakingheavily-Welsh accented-- version includes some Welsh dialog.  Thank goodness, and RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, it has subtitles: how else would  audiences understand it?  Coarse language, nudity and violence make it for mature audiences only, please.  Its in widescreen, Region 1, 16:9; not available streaming as of yet: series 2 is in production.

The episodes are:
Disc 1, Episode 1, Devils Bridge.
DCI Mathias arrives in Aberystwyth,  begins to settle into his lonesome seaside caravan when he's called to a blood-spattered house. It seems clear that the 64-year-old woman who lived there was brutally attacked, lost so much blood she must have died, but her body is not there. The investigation leads to scenic Devils Bridge and its falls, and an inn, formerly a children's home with a cruel history.

Disc 2, Episode 2, Night Music.
A 69-year-old man is found bludgeoned to death at a remote farmhouse. To solve his mystery, Mathias must go back into local lore and piece together eerie photographs, a tale of World War II German prisoners of war, an old letter in German, murky land deals, an organization of professional men, and a love story that spans some 70 years.

Disc 3, Episode 3, Penwyllt.
In an isolated quarry lake in the hills above Aberystwyth, amateur divers find a young mans body.  Mathias is pulled into the complex web of a nearby close-knit mountain village. The case is complicated by an apparent suicide and a hermit ex-convict whose lonely life in a caravan is too close to the detective's for comfort.

Disc 4, Episode 4, The Girl in the Water.
In marshland, two teenage boys come upon the body of a lovely young woman in a scarlet dress. Mathias becomes emotionally involved with her mother; Rhys notices. A  suspect takes matters into his own hands; a previous case comes back to haunt the detective.

The series is gorgeously filmed. It is superbly acted, even to the smallest parts, by actors who, unlike those in American cop shows, look like they live in the real world.  There isn't a single pretty boy or girl among them.  (Though I couldn't help wondering why the British police tolerated Mathiass scruffy appearance.)  The powerful production seems to have been originally written for the screen; it gives us engrossing, moving characters with opaque character arcs.  The occasional use of Welsh lends to its sense of place; the unobtrusive but appropriate soundtrack adds to every scene.  The main protagonists are multi-faceted.  Viewers will want to know more about them, but the writers, at least in this first series, are keeping their secrets.  We get only bits  about what caused our protagonist Mathias to relocate to this land that time seems to have forgotten.  I found it hard to believe that someone, somewhere  in Wales  was able to create a show like this, that I found so exciting I was completely gripped by it, and nearly an overwhelming emotional experience.  Wow.",1404000000,9,4175,5.100147275405007
6332324,4,B00J3M54AW,"Moody, gloomy, atmospheric; beautiful scenery; and all that.

Portions were shot in Welsh, other portions in English.  Characters switch back and forth, sometimes in mid-sentence (often seemingly for no reason other than to be more Welsh).  You get subtitles for the Welsh dialog, but not for the English.  As an American who must translate both accents in her brain, I found this confusing; I could have done with subtitles for *all* of the dialog.

That said, it's certainly a quality production, filmed where the stories take place (those are real cold noses and frosty breaths, not cheapo CGI artifacts).  It's watchable at the very least, and if you're Welsh, I'm sure it's a treat.",1402531200,9,687,4.982456140350878
6332325,5,B00J3M54AW,"E.A.Solinas has written such a thorough, thoughtful, and accurate review of this series that I don't need to repeat his appreciation. The long, complex episodes seem like films in themselves, and each one is beautiful to behold and wonderful to listen to. However, with sorrow, I would add a warning for those who have trouble picking up English that is strongly accented, since most of the characters (though not the protagonist, thankfully) have lilting Welsh accents that can be problematic for an American. This was not much of a problem for me once I got used to it because I have a facility for adapting to accented speech. My husband, however, does not, and so the first episode ended with him saying with frustration that he might not be able to watch any more. In fact, after I pleaded that I would play translator as much as he needed, he has watched the rest because he agrees that it's too beautiful to turn one's back on, but I REALLY hope that series/season two will be made with full English subtitles available (and no, neither of us is deaf). I'm not sure what the last reviewer of the three on the current page means when he speaks of shoddy subtitles; does he speak Welsh? If so, more power to him, but in our copy of this DVD the ONLY subtitles available are, yes, embedded in the film but only when Welsh itself is spoken.",1401926400,56,1343,4.530864197530864
6332326,5,B00J3M54AW,"Scenery is as rugged as local murder is gritty. It is Wales's stark coastal landscapes that can quickly turn goth spooky. Much of the footage is filmed on locations in and near Aberystwyth. Travelogue beauty but largely hate crime script. Welsh actors are used in leading roles because series is filmed in both Welsh & English. Richard Harrington (""Bleak House"" to ""Lark Rise to Candleford"") is DCI Tom Mathias, a driven, contemplative, pensive cop who has an ongoing secret history with 2 kids and Meg. He uses a dispirited face 50% of the time: head bowed with eyes rolled upward. Way overused expression. My only fault of this series. Fans seem to rate it higher than reviewers. I agree with the fans.
DI Rhys (Mali Harries) has the local knowledge needed. DS Owens (Hannah Daniel) and DC Ellis (Alex Harries) do the situation room research. CSI Prosser (Aneirin Hughes) expects respect, and mistrusts Mathias.

SUBTITLES for four 99-minute episodes and bonus footage helps with the Welsh accent.
1-DEVIL'S BRIDGE _ _ _ New job in seaside Aberystwyth, Wales, and Mathias's first day, first case is 64-yr-old Helen Jenkins' brutal attack but the body is missing. A closed children's home, its dark secrets, and the Devil's Bridge are part of the focus. Devil's Bridge Welsh myth is explained.
2-NIGHT MUSIC _ _ _ 69-yr-old Idris Williams is beaten at a remote mountain farm. Inquiries stir a dark pot of historical clues: faceless photos, German war forces, land deals, a guild, and an old romance.
3-PENWYLLT _ _ _ An unidentified near-naked body is found in a quarry lake. Penwyllt is a tight-mouthed secret-ridden village that makes it harder for Mathias to determine suicide or murder.
4-THE GIRL IN THE WATER _ _ _ A seated scarlet dressed body is found in a marsh center. DCI Mathias is again adversely troubled by his past. A Walsh myth `Blodeuwedd' is incorporated in the story. Expect a surprise ending.

6332328,4,B00J3M54AW,"""Hinterland"" (aka ""Y Gwyll"") was created to fill a gap. Executive producer Ed Thomas believes that every country needs an iconic detective, and that Wales lacked one.

The result: a very solid mystery series that focuses on a team of homicide specialists in the Welsh city of Aberystwyth. Richard Harrington gives an absolutely brilliant performance as a new police detective with a haunted past, who investigates one baffling and saddening mystery after another -- and the series' major flaw is that we still don't know much about him.

In ""Devil's Bridge,"" DCI Tom Mathias (Harrington) has barely arrived in Aberystwyth when he's called to his first murder. An old lady has vanished, leaving a lethal amount of blood splattered all over her cottage -- and when Tom does some further investigation, he finds her body. The case takes him back to an orphanage with some ugly secrets, and someone who wants revenge.

""Night Music"" brings him to a newly-murdered, elderly recluse who is somehow tangled in land dealings, love affairs, missing German soldiers and an old lady. ""Penwyllt"" takes him to an isolated village where a man is found in a quarry lake, and Mathias discovers that the victim was murdered -- which in turn leads him to a tangle of arson, affairs and secrets.

Finally, ""The Girl in the Water"" is a young lady in a red dress, found arranged in the Borth marsh. They don't lack suspects -- her violent alcoholic father, ex-boyfriend and creepy teacher-lover among them -- but Mathias suspects that something else caused her death. And as he becomes romantically involved with the victim's mother, he discovers that the next murder may become very personal...

""Hinterland"" frequently gets compared to a lot of other gritty European mystery series like ""The Killing"" or ""Wallander."" This isn't entirely fair -- it has a melancholy beauty that is purely Welsh, matching the wild, grey-tinged landscapes wrapped with misty sun and rain. Even more strikingly, the folklore (""Devil's Bridge"") and myths (the legend of Blodeuwedd) of Wales are seamlessly integrated into the stories.

Also, unlike ""The Killing,"" it has multiple mysteries. And unlike Wallander,  it doesn't have that intensely depressing quality that makes you want to suck on the business end of a Glock and repeatedly pull the trigger.

But it does have a very Celtic melancholy and bittersweetness, especially in the approach to the crimes -- there's compassion and/or sadness, even when Mathias temporarily goes nuts and tries to throttle a murderer. The mysteries unfold slowly and painstakingly, often with gruesome or peculiar slants, and sometimes you actually feel very sorry for the people who are doing the killing. Only sometimes, though.

But the show revolves around Mathias, performed to perfection by Harrington. Harrington's sad-pug eyes and perpetually furrowed brow give him an air of melancholy, which fits a cop with a mysterious checkered past.  That is the major problem with the show, though. We have some small hints about Mathias' past -- it sounds like he may have had a kid, and his brother died under unknown circumstances -- but nothing that major. And in the course of a whole season, we should definitely know SOMETHING.

""Hinterland Series 1"" brings the gritty police procedural to Wales, while giving it a unique feel all its own -- and Richard Harrington's performance is mesmerizing. Bring on the second season!",1401321600,95,3424,5.0964285714285715

6332336,4,B00J3M54AW,"Beginning in 2014 and running for three seasons, HINTERLANDor Y GWYLL in Welsh, meaning THE DUSKis a police drama set in Wales and is the first BBC series to be filmed in both English and Welsh.  The accents are extremely rich, and it is fortunate that the slight extras include English subtitles.

In a general sense, the series follows DCI Tom Mathias (Richard Harrington), who has been transferred from London to Wales apparently against his will and due to an unspecified situation.  The first season indicates an over-arching storyline.  Mathais is secretive about his past, seems to be punishing himself for some unspecified reason, seems to be divorced, and frequently gazes upon a photograph of two little girls.  Children seem to be an ouch line for himand they often figure directly in the episodes.

Season one includes four titles.  Each title is presented in two chapters.  In THE DEVILS BRIDGE, Mathais has barely arrived when he is called to the scene of an elderly womans disappearancea scene so bloody that her murder is strongly implied.  The investigation soon leads him to a now-closed childrens home, the building for which has been converted into an out-of-the-way hotel.  NIGHT MUSIC finds Mathais and his team investigating the blunt-instrument death of an elderly, eccentric, and reclusive man whose fondness for photography may or may not have prompted his murder.

In PENWYLLT, the discovery of a body concealed in a quarry lake leads Mathais to a circle of friends, and the special-needs child of one of the couples may be involved.  In THE GIRL IN THE WATER, an attractive young woman is found dead, posed in a red dress in the middle of a marshland, and the bizarre nature of the crime has an equally bizarre solution and conclusion.

HINTERLAND might best be described as a mixture of police procedural and noir, but the emphasis is on the latter.  The tone and style bring words like dark, brooding, ""grim,"" and drear to mind, and the overarching story lines are not resolved within any of the episodes or in the season, leaving you to wonder.  Some of the plot lines seem a bit ify to me, but they play well, and the cast is superior, with Mali Harries, Alex Harries, Hannah Daniel, and Aneirin Hughes delivering strong support as Mathais team and superior officer.  Recommended, but if you are looking for a witty mystery series akin to MIDSOMER MURDERS (a personal favorite), you're in the wrong place.

6332345,4,B00J3M54AW,"Hinterland (Y Gwyll) debuted on Welsh public television station S4C in October 2013, followed by the English-language debut on BBC One a few months later. The show takes place in Aberystwyth, on the Welsh coast. Each episode is filmed in Welsh and English; the English version retains a small amount of Welsh, which is subtitled. Our detective protagonist is the brooding DCI Tom Mathias (Richard Harrington), who is said to have a checkered past. Small clues as to what might be troubling the detective are dropped in each episode. His second is DI Mared Rhys (Mali Harries), professional and well-established in the Aberystwyth police force. DC Lloyd Elis (Alex Harries) is the teams bespeckled and tireless researcher, always on the telephone or glued to a computer. DS Sin Owens (Hannah Daniel) is young and eager to impress.

Their boss is Ch Supt Brian Prosser (Aneirin Hughes), who admonishes DCI Mathias to Stop chasing ghosts, Tom! The shows writers repeatedly imply that there is something sinister about Prosser, but we never see him to anything wrong so are left wondering what the vague aspersions are about. The mysteries take place on the blustery Welsh coast, among rural and small-town folk, who embody the image of a Wales whose thriving economy was a thing of the past. The filmmakers use the landscape and rural isolation to full effect. I felt they could have saved themselves some trouble and kept the scenes that depict peoples home lives in Welsh with English subtitles, but there is not much Welsh in the English version. The roots of contemporary crime found in the distant past is a theme in three out of four 90-minute episodes, reflective, intentionally or not, of Wales looming past.

The episodes are:

On DCI Tom Mathias first day on the job in Aberystwyth, he is called to a bloody scene at the home of elderly Helen Jenkins. Reverend Eurof Daniel (Phylip Hughes) had gone looking for Jenkins when she didn't show up at Sunday services, only to find the bathroom in her home covered in blood. With no body, DCI Mathias and DI Mared Rhys look to Jenkins past for someone who might know her. For years she ran a childrens home called Pontarfynach, that took its name from nearby Devils Bridge. When Jenkins body is found in a ravine, dumped off of Devils Bridge, the detectives set out to track down people who grew up at the home, which had a reputation for cruelty and abuse. The trail leads to Catrin John (Sara Lloyd Gregory), now a middle-class mother, her troubled childhood friend Jenny James (Sara Lloyd), and groundskeeper Byron Rogers (Wyn Bowen Harries).

In Night Music, the body of 69-year-old Idris Williams is found in the kitchen of his farmhouse, bleeding from a single blow to the back of the head. Williams led an isolated life, had no working car, and walking into his home was like walking into the past, complete with black-and-white chemical darkroom, one room locked and covered with cobwebs. Williams was a photography hobbiest. Idris was a non-paying tenant on land that was owned by his father, a respected sheep farmer, before passing to the local guild in 1982. The investigation takes diverse paths, as Mathias and Rhys question deliveryman Dylan Bevan (Rhodri Sion), who has a violent past, proprietress of a local camera shop Nia Morgan (Eiry Thomas), and the team investigates the mysterious transfer of land from a neighboring farm over the course of a half-century, whose roots go back to World War II.

Amateur divers discover the body of 24-year-old Michael Reynolds tied to a truck tire at the bottom of a flooded, disused quarry in Penwylit. The property is owned by Tommy James (Ifan Huw Dafydd), who employed the dead man and whose overprotected 12-year-old son Defi (Rhys Edwards-Griffiths) was fond of him. As Reynolds, a newcomer in town, was beaten and drowned elsewhere, DCI Mathias and DI Rhys cast their net wider to include Gwilym Morgan (Richard Elis), who sold tires and whose wife Lowri (Heledd Baskerville) was close to Reynolds, and a reclusive woodsman with a violent past, Wyn Bratton (Matthew Gravelle), whom Mathias defends against unfounded accusations. Mathias begin to think that several people know more than they say. For reasons that are not at all clear, Mathias becomes unusually emotional and angry about this case.

The body of Alys Thomas (Lara Kipp) is discovered sitting, gracefully posed in a bright red dress, in coastal marshes in The Girl in the Water. When DCI Mathias and DI Rhys inform her mother Gwen (Nia Roberts), they learn that Alys father Iwan (Geraint Morgan) is an alcoholic former police officer now estranged from his family. Alys classics professor Wynford Rees (Dewi Rhys Williams) speaks of her zest for life and love of literature, passions that may not have served her well. Alys father attacked her drug dealer Dean (Daniel Rochford), whose alibi is in doubt. The very odd thing about this mystery is that the cause of death is never mentioned, so we don't understand why the police are certain that she was murdered. The aesthetic is also very different from previous episodes: bright colors and blinding sunlight. It takes place in the resort town of Borth.",1482364800,,5184,4.912100456621005
6332346,4,B00J3M54AW,"I enjoy this series. Love the setting in Wales, love the lyrical Welsh language. The storylines are so so. I will agree with another reviewer that sometimes it is hard to figure out who did what. I do appreciate a dectective series that isn't overly gory or violent. Just a bit of grit. I've noticed in the second series the tortured gazes and angst riddled glances from the two leads are a bit too predominant and starting to get annoying.

Why anyone would care about these characters quite escapes me,  and, quite frankly, after watching a couple of episodes of this I'm inclined to start a kickstarter campaign to send ropes to every person in Wales  so they  can all escape their miserable existences. The idea that there can be so many mysterious murders in a place that appears to be all but devoid of human inhabitants is absurd - almost as absurd as the riduclous misallocation of resources that we are expected to beleive the police force in this miserable place engages in. Do the welsh really allocate more detectives to solving the murder of a destitute farmhand than the Americans put on the Kennedy assasination? No wonder they have earned such little reknown in the world! It is a land of despondantnavel-gazers!

Spare yourself the misery of this and check out something intelligent like Transformers 7.",1461888000,4,1054,4.801104972375691
6332360,4,B00J3M54AW,"DCI Tom Mathias is brand-new to the Aberystwyth police force, on the west central coast of Wales. He travels light, and lives in a trailer parked at an abandoned farmhouse. Tom is alone and unmarried, but as the season progresses we find out that he is missing someones, though we don't find out why in Series 1. ""Hinterland"" takes place in and around the city of Aberystwyth. The outlying area is called Y Gwyll, or the Hinterland, and that's where most of the action takes place. This a very rural & remote feeling series.

""Hinterland"" is good mystery viewing, but it is definitely dour. The 1st  and 4th episodes are actually a bit creepy. I would call the series more seriously-minded overall compared to ""Shetland"" and ""Vera"",  and about on par with Iain Glen's  ""Jack Taylor"" mysteries. A couple times a sequence gets too drawn out and a tad melodramatic. DI Rhys has an annoying habit of giving long anguished looks. But overall, this is good mystery viewing with interesting plots. There is some really excellent lighting of scenes and faces.

Series 1 originally aired in October 2013 in Welsh. This Welsh production was filmed in full in both Welsh and English, which took extra time. Series 2 originally aired in January 2015 with 5 episodes. A series 3 is in production in early 2016.

The DVD set gives you 398 minutes of mystery viewing. The show is presented in 16:9 aspect ratio and stereo. There are 10 Bonus Extras in the DVD set. They're described after the episodes they follow, as A-J. English subtitles are available on both the episodes and the Bonus Extras.

Episodes:
....Episode 1.  ""Devil's Bridge"" Mathias hits the ground running in his new job, when he drives to meet DI Mared Rhys at a murder site on a Sunday, before he's even been into the office to introduce himself. There is carnage in the bathroom with the tub full of bloody water and a broken tooth on the floor. Instead of a body, though, they find a framed print of Sydney Vesper's ""Salem"" smashed on the floor. Rhys tells Mathias, ""The devil's face is said to be hidden in the folds of the Welsh lady's shawl.""
....A. ""The Myth Behind Episode 1"" This is two pages to read on the screen, describing the legend behind this episode.
....Episode 2. ""Night Music"" Idris Williams has a farmhouse with a cheerful blue-painted kitchen. That is he HAD a farmhouse, because he is found dead in his kitchen from a mighty blow to his head. Was it because of a photo Mathias finds in Idris' darkroom?
....Episode 3. ""Penwyllt"" The village of Penwyllt, pronounced pen WIST, has seen better days. Twenty years ago the quarry owned by Tommy James closed, and he surrounded it with a chain link fence. That doesn't stop two amateur divers from breaking in to test the waters in the filled quarry. What they find is the body of a man wearing only his underwear.
A character is described as a typical city kid: 'Thought the countryside was a playground. But it's not. It's where we live and work, and it's bloody hard.""
....Episode 4 ""The Girl in the Water"" Two boys lead their white pony across the knee-high grass of a marshy plain. And there, sitting calmly on the ground in a bright red party dress, a pretty girl gazes upon them. It takes a couple seconds to sink in. Her skin is gray and she is not moving. Someone has set her body up almost reverently.
Odi et amo.
I hate and I love.
....B. ""The Myth Behind Episode 4"" Four written pages to read telling the story of ""Blodeuwedd"".
....C. ""Characters"" (7 minutes) This bonus has excerpted scenes and clips of the actors talking about their characters. Commentators include Hannah Daniel (plays DC Sian Owen), Alex Harries (plays DC Lloyd Elis), Aneirin Hughes (plays Chief Superintendent Brian Prosser), Mali Harries (plays DI Mared Rhys) and Richard Harrington (plays DCI Tom Mathias). In the opening credits, Mathias is shown jogging. Harrington says, ""I'm a runner myself, so is the character. Some real twisted irony here  the production company have stopped me running because I might hurt myself. But the amount of running I've been doing on screen is ridiculous.""
....D. ""Design"" (4 minutes) Commentators are Ed Talfan (producer) and Eryl Ellis (production designer). Their descriptions show that the show's overall feeling of almost oppressive dourness is by design. Talfen: ""The precinct, the hinterland is dark and sinewy and ancient.""  Ellis continues, ""It's very challenging from the point of view of the resonance of Hinterland. It's almost a state of mind... It's this past that keeps showing its face all the time in the scripts.""
....E. ""Locations"" (6 minutes) Commentators include Marc Evans (director episode 1), Rhys Powys (director episode 3), Gethin Scourtlerd (producer), Ed Thomas (executive producer). The whole series is filmed around the real Aberystwyth. Per Evans: ""Within half an hour of Aberystwyth... you can be in such varied locations  stunning locations.""
....F. ""Welsh/English"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Ed Talfan, Ed Thomas, Richard Harrington, Mali Harries, Hannah Daniel, Marc Evans and Alex Harries. You know this was proudly filmed in Wales when you watch two beginnings of filming the same scene. First it will be filmed in English, and the director yells, ""OK, let's do it in English."" When they're done, he then says, ""Okay, And [now we do] the Right.""
....G. ""Welsh Show Reel"" (4 minutes) This is like a promo, in Welsh with English subtitles.
....H. ""Ed Thomas Interview  The Episodes"" (1 minute) Very short, probably a TV promo, also. Ed Thomas speaks in Welsh, with English subtitles.
....I.  ""Ed Thomas Interview  The Genre"" (1 minute) Also in Welsh, with English subtitles.
....J. ""Photo Gallery"" (2 minutes) The photos were taken during shooting and rehearsals, and include scenery.

Trivia:  From watching the show, I think you pronounce Aberystwyth as  ab er IST.  From watching Mathias at work, you'd think it's a village. But including its suburbs, it has 16,000 people. And that's not including the 10,000 students who move in when the University is in session. It is a prettily coastal town which is a tourist destination.

6332361,2,B00J3M54AW,"Be aware that these are hardly light-hearted mysteries, not that murder is ever light-hearted. But the classic English murder mysteries were often set among the upper classes, with a range of respectable, well-groomed suspects. In Hinterland, as presented in season one, practically everyone we meet is a dispossessed loser. No hint remains of the prosperity cultivated by the early industrialists, John Crichton-Stuart (FATHER AND SON) 2nd and 3rd Marquess of Bute. Yet they were for a time in 19th century the richest men in the world. The story of Wales is more than an account of sad sacks ruing abandoned farms and living in tumble down shacks. I was rather hoping for something more socially encompassing similar to the Brokenwood mysteries. They are great stories, well-acted, and charcteristic of New Zealand. If Hinterland is characteristic of Wales it is wonder that anyone lives there.",1457308800,,896,5.229166666666667

6332364,1,B00J3M54AW,"If you like murder mysteries set in exotice, strage locations watch Vera, Fortitude, Wallander, or Shetland. Avoid Hinterland.  Boring, boring boring. Watching this show you would think that welch actors can do only one emotion; a blank stare, because that's all you will see in these episodes. There is no interaction amongst the characters and there is no redeeming or interesting qualities in them either.  The only emotions you find is at the end of an episode when the case is solved and the suspect, murderer or victim find out what has happened and they throw themselves to the floor screaming their heads off.  Halfway through the second episode, I was shocked when one of the suspects actually said hello and smiled. I realized I hadn't seen one...at all.  At least Vera teases and/or yells at her staff and her assistant has a funny loving family at home. If you want to see how beautiful the Welsh hinterlands are, buy a National Geographic document/travel guide.  Waste of time.",1452556800,5,990,4.869047619047619
6332365,2,B00J3M54AW,"Not terribly bad, but not very good. The Welsh scenary is beautiful, the acting is fine but the crime stories and characterizations are weak. There is very little for the actors to work with.
This series belongs to the ""police procedural drama"" genre. Unfortunately, the lead characters are not credible as police investigators. Their witness interviews are inane, the crime scene examination is laughable and all pursued leads are due to hunches.  I think if the writers are not interested in portraying actual police procedures then they should write crime dramas about private investigators. The quality of the stories decreased as the first season advanced. The last story was unbelievable, the killer's motivation was nonsensical and the detective's behavior totally unprofessional. Let's have a moratorium on cops with excess angst.
 There was also the odd decision to have the assisting female detective dressed in various low cut tops. I've never seen a plainclothes detective flashing that much bosum. In this frosty climate, all the characters are zipped up, head to toe, in wool caps, bulky parkas and boots. All are protected, bundled up against the harsh Welsh weather, except the female detective's chest. Odd.",1452384000,22,1224,5.304123711340206

6332372,3,B00J3M54AW,"Slow, slow, slow. It's meant to be dark and moody, I know, but seriously, very little acting is going on in this show. Everyone has only one expression -- of deep angst, or perhaps constipation. The lead, Richard Harrington, puts in a rather creepy performance. In real life, if the mother of a murdered child looked up and saw the police investigator staring at her through her kitchen window, without warning or explanation, just standing there, wouldn't it seem creepy? And if he kisses her, wouldn't it seem inappropriate? This actor depends on lots of long, deep, meaningful looks instead of any acting. Or maybe the writers just aren't giving him any dialogue?

""The Killing"" and its ilk are overdone. We don't need more gritty, dark and moody cop shows without much story or much in the way of performance.",1442448000,4,813,4.807142857142857

Authentic, Atmospheric, Moody, Gloomy, Stormy, Crashing Waves, Windy, Brooding, Mysterious......YES this series has it all and more, as it's an authentic WELSH endeavor that was created by committed, talented artists.

And as such, (and how fortunate for viewers!) it's all set in the Welsh Seaside/Countryside/Hinterlands .....I LOVE IT!!

I LIVE for atmospheric films and television series--and this series is a prime example of how important such qualities are, and it also calls attention to how often film and TV are lacking in such things.

Oh and did I mention--the acting is superb! And subtle. (There is a recently widowed Vicar-character in Episode One/Season One-- his performance moved me to tears. His loneliness and angst was palpable. Quite impressive!).

The production values are top-notch. And the whodunit aspect is great storytelling. THANK YOU to the creators, producers, writers and actors for providing such great entertainment.

I really started to like the main characters and I absolutely loved looking at the beautiful Welsh countryside where all of the exterior scenes were shot. But then from the third film things started to fall apart - the stories become absurd, motives for murder unconvincing, AND the lead detective's constant brooding and silent 'meaningful' glances he gives the other characters become ANNOYING and a farce!!! Oh, and the resolution in the last film is just plain silly!!

So imagine your the new chief inspector here, not so welcomed by your staff or your land. But the writing will keep you guessing; it's taught and each episode runs close to two hours. Far from being a tourist call to visit Wales, this is a view of reality from the people to the weather.

Brooding and bleak like the Welsh terrain, the detective matches the background of this series.  It is set in Western Wales by the water, so the scenery is exquisite.  Detective Mathias (Richard Harrington) is fairly unreadable, somewhat cerebral with some compassion.  His female sidekick, Rhys (Mali Harries) is a tad jollier and a counterpoint to his personality.

6332420,2,B00J3M54AW,"There's something very wrong with this dark series, which is quickly recognized: it's morose, bizarre, macabre. The writer(s) seem psychologically damaged. I came away from each episode wondering if the screenplay was designed simply to disturb. The characters are too troubled and appear significantly incomplete. (Perhaps four episodes isn't enough to develop their personalities. This show has very little character or development.) Also, except for Hannah Daniel (with her Blonde next door look, but she's NOT drop-dead gorgeous) the actors are too plain, too ordinary, too unremarkable; none of them present us with anything memorable or interesting. Even the hero's car (Volvo C90, wooo...) is boring. (Endeavor, Morse, Lewis, drive Jags; Magnum and Crockett run in Ferraris; Beckett leads with a Charger; and even Clouseau sports a cute tiny Citron. Heroes' autos should be memorable and noteworthy!) There is practically no humor (which is needed to cut the sardonic tension) and no one ever smiles. The murder mystery here is adequate, I figured out each murderer about the same time as Harrington's DCI character (why don't the other actors get to solve cases?). The very best parts of this odd series is the music (without any easily to remembered tunes) and the Welsh country-side (which is often pretty boring). No need to make a second (2014) series. Let ""Hinterland"" die the slow angry death (as does each of its episodes).",1411171200,4,1438,5.256521739130434
6332421,4,B00J3M54AW,"Hinterland is in large part a Wallander wannabe, and actually does a fine job of it on several fronts. The photography is astounding. The characters are well-drawn and compelling. The atmosphere is all-enveloping. The plots themselves are rather good, with one exception, and was easily hooked and held captive all the way through. And yet...

Brooding and grimness are ""in"" these days, an age dominated by the spirit of all those doleful Scandinavian crime writers. And I am taken with that mood, except that sometimes I feel that in Hinterland, as in other series, silent staring is used to make us fill in the blanks with our own imagination. That's certainly a justifiable dramatic strategy, but Hinterland perhaps over-uses that technique, so that a good part of each episode consists of people just staring at each other or at the landscape.

There are some back stories present, but we get only hints of most. Mathias had a brother who is presumably dead, and he doesn't want to talk about it. He also appears to have had a pair of daughters, and a wife who won't speak to him. I'm guessing the daughters are dead as well, but we don't know yet. One of Mathias' assistants has a poor relationship with her daughter, so far presented as a pretty stock example of that kind of disfunction. And then there is the creepy Superintendent, who appears to have something to hide -- perhaps something ghastly and criminal. Maybe we'll get to that in season two. Anyway, the back stories are proceeding glacially and in this first season take on the qualities of a somewhat tedious tease.

I mentioned plot earlier, and on the whole, the episodes hold up reasonably well -- except for the last one, which includes a number of plot holes, major loose threads, and highly unprofessional and seemingly unmotivated behavior by Mathias. It's one huge mess, but the others are fine. If you take to brooding atmospherics, this set will take you to heights you may not have known existed. If you are one who is entranced by plot rather than style, this will be enjoyable but not the brilliant tour de force that some see it as.

For me, it's not perfect, but superbly executed.",1410652800,,2166,4.737400530503979

6332423,5,B00J3M54AW,"It is hard to understated many of the poor ratings for this film. I can only guess that they were done by Americans who seek car chases through urban areas and lots of shootings. One must remember that a slower pace does not mean that nothing is happening. Much in this film is about the silence of internal processes, thought and the simmer of feelings. I found the characters quite compelling for the most part. Harrington's character in particular is riveting. The cinematography was wonderful as well and I found the soundtrack did excellent mood setting for the quiet, actionless segments.

6332431,4,B00J3M54AW,"Hinterland- a remote region, a land beyond the coast.

Over the past year I have been reading several mystery/detective procedural novels based in Wales. The country filled with long desolate highways, curved roads, isolated villages and dark pasts. However, the people are engaging and full of history. Hinterland is a BBC Wales four-part television series set and largely filmed in the coastal town of Aberystwyth, Wales. Now, Netflix has 'Hinterland' to stream into your homes.

In this small town, comes a new DCI, Tom Mathias played by Richard Harrington. He fits into the landscape very well, dark and dour without a smile. He has a past history, but we are not to learn about it in this series. He lives in a mobile home on a vast area of land, and the home us as bleak as the man. His colleagues, Mali Harries plays DI Mared Rhys. She has beautiful eyes and knows this land as her own. If you have viewed several BBC series, I don't think you will have any difficulty with the accents. I was able to catch and understand every word.

For a small town, there are murders a plenty. Four episodes fill this series, and in each, the storyline will convince you to continue. The characters are all so well presented. No background, we learn as we go, so to speak. We learn DCI Mathias is an intelligent, excellent detective. He can also lead a group with expertise. His team is well rounded, learning to work together, and no one should be late. The murders are mysterious, and not for the faint of heart. Clever murderers, but the DCI is one step ahead of them. I have recently read that Series 2 has been commissioned.

6332435,5,B00J3M54AW,"As a true fan of ""Masterpiece Mysteries"" on PBS, I become frustrated during ""rerun season"" and need my new mystery ""fix"".  I wasn't familiar with ""Hinterland"", but I took a chance and ordered it.  Although the series' atmosphere is somewhat ""dark"", I don't find the stories to be depressing.  The acting is excellent, and one comes to truly care about the entire investigative cast of characters.  One learns, gradually, about their private lives as the series progresses.  I don't enjoy tv mystery airings that seem to ""need"" to focus on bloody, gruesome images of the victims (my imagination functions quite well, thank you!), and this series, while it shows the bodies, relies on good writing and intriguing storylines to hold the viewer's attention, rather than dismembered limbs and crawling maggots.  I also dislike a mystery in which I'm two steps ahead of the investigator, and while the viewer may get to some ideas before the main character does, I guarantee the viewer won't have all the answers.  If I have one complaint, it's that the series is set in Winter, so although the grayness contributes to the atmosphere, Wales is a beautiful country with gorgeous scenery, and that's not evident here.  Of course, this is a mystery series and not a travelogue, bottom line- great acting, intriguing stories, top shelf entertainment.",1408924800,5,1340,5.031674208144796

6332446,4,B00J3M54AW,"I'm beginning to think there are two different DVD releases being reviewed here because the version I purchased is woefully lacking in any Welsh dialogue and has full English subtitles that are adequate for keeping up with the place names and personal names, but not the best done I've ever seen.  They either ran too fast or too slow and occasionally had speakers misidentified.

As for the series itself, if you are looking for a fast running action packed show you aren't going to get that here.  Hinterland is a thinking viewer's program.  There are a lot of dialogue free scenes that invite you to watch and share the thought process of Mathias as he exams clues.  It reminds me of a basic rule of art - that negative space (the area not containing the primary image) can be as important to the picture as the positive space.  Here that concept is demonstrated using silence to bring as much knowledge and impact as the written dialogue.

For people used to flashy police programs that are heavy on the personalities and backgrounds of the detectives themselves this show will probably disappoint.  Hints are dropped here and there about the personal lives/backgrounds of the main detectives, Mathias and Rhys, but not much at all is given on the rest of the regular cast.  That isn't really such a bad thing though because this isn't meant to be a soap-opera relationship riddled series - it's described in many places as noir and that fits it well. It's dark.  It's creepy.  There are no fluffy endings.  In trying to find an American equivalent I really can't think of one - so if that's your preferred television style you'll probably want to skip this show.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is the DVDs themselves.  I've already mentioned my disappointment with the subtitles and lack of Welsh language versions being included, but there's more.  This is a four episode series - each episode is 90 minutes and they needed to waste disc space by putting only one episode per disc?  Seriously?  How much hard would it have been to put the same lousy subtitles on a Welsh language version and give the viewer their choice of which they want to see?  Personally, I would have paid more to get that option and I'm seriously disappointed at the lack.  Someone who has a Welsh DVD version tell me where to find it because I sure as heck would like one for myself!  Anyone interested in a show of this sort probably has the willingness if not the interest to watch it in the native tongue of Wales, yet we're aren't give it.

6332448,3,B00J3M54AW,"Not interesting. There are four stories, four separate plots using whodunnit shticks. We don't get much about the lives of the two detectives, although we are teased with bits.

The two detectives, one a man, in a new town ('in the hinterlands') alone and staying alone, and one a woman, presumably divorced, who hasn't much connection with her teenage daughter and her mother. Sometimes the two detectives look at each other during a scene, seeming to convey that they have just learned something new and surprising - the looks last too long and don't convey much.
Although they work together we don't know what their relationship is like.

The writing is poorish, lacking in originality and detail. The detectives don't ask the most obvious questions sometimes. The directing is frequently awkward and ponderous.

I am writing this in the middle of the last episode, just trying to keep busy while I wait for the end.

There is nothing at all to relieve the gloom here. The main character is depressed and stays that way throughout.

I wonder if the writer grew up on American police mysteries.

A really good series is by Sally Wainright, Happy Valley, a six-episode story about a woman detective, played by Sarah
