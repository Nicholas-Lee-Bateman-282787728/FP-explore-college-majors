5424048,5,B00AFSSMTI,Great workout!,1408838400,,14,6.5
5424049,5,B00AFSSMTI,It definetly works if you do it consistley ..I wish it went a quicker though. After you learn the moves you want to go at a little bit of a quicker pace.,1400889600,,153,3.8125
5424050,5,B00AFSSMTI,I exercise at least 5 days a week.  I found this to be a good full body challenging workout.  The instruction is excellent as there is the lead instructor and two back up instructors who demonstrate the exercises.  I would recommend this as an advanced workout.,1390089600,25,261,4.630434782608695
5424051,5,B00AFSSMTI,"This is good work out with focus on the core.  It is not for beginners but you do not have to be very advanced.  I do a lot of cardio and yoga but those do not address so well my abs and core.  I never had to worry about abs but after two kids, this area needs more training.  This DVD is good without getting me exhausted.",1386633600,11,323,3.7761194029850746
5424052,5,B00AFSSMTI,Works perfectly. Great workout dvd.,1461974400,,35,6.2
5424053,5,B00AFSSMTI,thanks,1455580800,,6,6.0
5424054,4,B00AFSSMTI,Workout is good but intro is very long and difficult to bypass after first view.,1452556800,2,80,4.4
5424055,5,B00AFSSMTI,Great core workout.  I added weights (because thats how I learned Pilates) to the floor work.,1438646400,3,93,4.8125
5424056,4,B00AFSSMTI,"Good core workout without the jarring.
I like this main instructor.
He loves what he does and makes the time fly bye as well with his enthusiasm.
That female instructor in the background is sure easy on the eyes too.
Just saying:)",1431648000,,230,4.5
5424057,5,B00AFSSMTI,"I use this video a few times a week.  It is a great workout, incorporating many different moves that transition nicely.",1429488000,,119,4.666666666666667
5424058,4,B00AFSSMTI,A short but somewhat challenging workout. Could do without all the nods to Stott's Pilates and all the long introductions but I like the workout.,1428364800,4,145,4.84
5424059,2,B00AFSSMTI,"After working out mostly 4 times a week using primarily barre method (Physique 57, Tracey Mallett, etc.) I found this DVD very easy and not challenging at all.  I think it's on the intermediate to beginner level, so the title appears misleading.  Jennifer Kries Pilates III is more advanced though I wish it was a little longer.  I'm very disappointed in this DVD and cannot seem to find other more challenging Pilates DVDs that don't require any equipment (easier that way when traveling) other than Jennifer Kries.",1418256000,7,516,4.908045977011494
5424060,5,B00AFSSMTI,Great challenging workout!!  It builds as you go along and really works the core.,1417651200,,81,4.785714285714286
5424061,5,B00AFSSMTI,"I really like this workout.  It's challenging, but extremely gentle on your joints. I use it after spinning or running so I'm not overworking parts.  Personally, I think it's the perfect length and the time goes by pretty quickly.",1416787200,9,230,4.871794871794871
8551136,1,B00AFSSMTI,Cant fast forward the dvd. Stops half way thru.,1528934400,,47,4.333333333333333
8551137,3,B00AFSSMTI,Not very extreme as the name suggests...,1490140800,,40,4.857142857142857
8551138,5,B00AFSSMTI,Great video with John Gary!  Love him.  I had been watching his ytube videos great to find a whole workout.,1488585600,,107,4.3
8551139,5,B00AFSSMTI,This is a good work out,1488499200,2,23,3.0
8551140,3,B00AFSSMTI,"I like the workout. It's not exactly what I would call extreme, and I am not an athlete. In fact, due to some health issues I'm quite out of shape right now but I didn't have any trouble with any of this. The only reason it's not a four or five is because there's so many advertisements that you can't skip through and I'm reluctant to even watch it a second time if I have to go through all that nonsense",1487980800,9,405,4.012345679012346

8551142,5,B00AFSSMTI,My mother In law loves this! She and her friends do a pilates class every monday and needed a switch up so I got her this and its one of their new favorites.,1485820800,,157,3.787878787878788
8551143,4,B00AFSSMTI,Great workout,1484265600,,13,6.0
8551144,5,B00AFSSMTI,Swift and perfect!,1482883200,,18,5.333333333333333
8551145,5,B00AFSSMTI,"As usual with John Garey the instructor , this workout is for those who are already in advance levels, it's powerful , works for the entire body , it improves coordination and stability you really sweat and feel accomplished , twice or three times a week , surly you will see the difference in your body and self. I love it!",1477958400,3,324,4.327868852459017
