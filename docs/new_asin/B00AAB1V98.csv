8549005,5,B00AAB1V98,I started playing tennis for about 3 months now and I was fortunate enough that my friend was able to recommend this DVD. This is very helpful and very informative. I actually got a lot of tips amd more detailed information here than what I learned from the court. I also shared this my coach and he was also amazed with how helpful this product is. As a result we were able to combine his techniques and the ones in the DVD and I can say that I am now getting better at this game everyday.,1354147200,,490,4.114583333333333

You also have to learn how to control things even if you feel like it's already beyond your grasp. This may sound impossible to someone who has never tried playing tennis but if you read through the guidelines stated in this book, you will learn that you can be a tennis pro in no time. As long as you are determined, you will not fail on this endeavor.",1353888000,,479,4.1063829787234045
