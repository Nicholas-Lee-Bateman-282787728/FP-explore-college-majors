8671685,4,B00MD5OPV0,"In this video Mr. Gurney clearly demonstrates quick sketching in paint and expertly captures moments in his travels. His explanations of the tools used are helpful and inspiring for those who wish to enjoy the act of creating whenever and wherever they choose. This is not a beginners guide to watercolor though it is extremely helpful for those wishing to examine the medium.

For an artist, keeping a sketchbook is important for further development of creative skills, concepts and observational knowledge. The demos on this DVD are fine examples of designing with life rather than just copying. Mr. Gurney certainly makes it look easy and fun as it it should be.",1438732800,5,665,4.990990990990991

8671688,5,B00MD5OPV0,"If you enjoy or would like to try Plein Air watercolor journaling, this James Gurney dvd is worth the shekels. Certainly do wish each painting demonstration section was a bit longer (don't we always want more of a good thing) and the fast-forward bits are irksome, but all in all, I would buy the Gurney dvd again. Instructive, up-beat and enjoyable. And it arrived lickity-split!!!",1425340800,6,382,4.892307692307693
