6788855,5,B00P7T7DM2,"I really enjoy Ann Blockley's approach to painting.  This is a very good video, filming her demonstration of the freedom she allows herself to create, her use of various watercolor mediums and in detail.  A most informative as well as enjoyable instructional DVD.",1428537600,,263,5.093023255813954

6788858,2,B00P7T7DM2,I was somewhat disappointed in the DVD.  It was mostly about throwing paint around with not much planning or discussion ahead of time then cropping to find the best compromise.  I thought the book was better because it had better explanations as to why and how.,1419033600,6,261,4.6521739130434785

8686660,3,B00P7T7DM2,"I have painted these techniques for many years, and I should have been more discerning when I bought this DVD. So it's completely my fault for getting very little out of this tape. I found Ann repeated herself all the time and tended to mumble to herself while painting, just sort of 'self talk' but  it was distracting. I wanted her to just get on with it!
 It had nothing new for me, and I will pass it on to others who are starting in this mixed media arena.",1472169600,3,461,4.168539325842697
8686661,5,B00P7T7DM2,"I bought this dvd using a gift card I received. I'm very picky about how I spend gift money/cards and I tend to buy something I wouldn't normally spend for myself, or at least something I was planning to buy but was saving or just waiting for the right time. I really was curious about this dvd and once I received it and watched it, I was really glad I'd gotten it.

I'm not a painter - yet. I play with paint, that's about it, but I have these ideas in my mind about what I'd like to paint (abstract for sure) and this artist brings some of my ideas to life, and gives more direction to other ideas I have had. I enjoyed watching her execute her techniques. It's a simple, straightforward dvd that I'm sure I'll watch at least a few times as I start playing with paint over the cooler seasons. I'm waiting because my paints dry out too fast in the hot season, and I like to hunker down in the cold season and do some art. But the first thing I'll try when I get my paint and paper out are some of the things from this dvd.",1470700800,,1024,4.044334975369458
8686662,5,B00P7T7DM2,"I learned so very much from this DVD! I love Ann's work and her Dad's (John Blockley) as well. Ann is very daring in her approach to painting her impressions and interpretations of a place! She explains every move, all her supplies and intentions as she goes along with the project. She shares her excitement and wonderfilled secrets to the best effects from materials used. The end result shows her heart within her work. Beautiful. I also purchased the book ""Experimental Landscapes in Watercolour"" which shares many different techniques. It's like the encyclopedia of exciting watercolor techniques !  Great DVD, you will certainly enjoy it!",1467158400,5,644,5.133333333333334
8686663,5,B00P7T7DM2,Love this book.  Well written and beautifully photographed.  Good choice!,1464825600,,73,6.2
8686664,5,B00P7T7DM2,"Absolutely love this DVD! It gives me great ideas to play with for new experimentation with watercolors. This isn't a beginners ""how to DVD"" this is for someone who already has some watercolor experience but wants to step outside of the lines and play with new ways to do things for a semi-abstract approach. This uses different mixed media techniques that some may be familiar with but maybe in a different manner than they have previously tried.",1463356800,6,447,4.818181818181818

8686667,5,B00P7T7DM2,She is fascinating lady. Her techniques are great. very inspirational.,1436486400,,70,6.1
8686668,5,B00P7T7DM2,"A friend had loaned me her copy of this DVD.  After watching it, I had to have my own!  It is extremely well filmed; camera angles, pace.  Ms. Blockley explains her process thoroughly and clearly.  When you have finished watching it, you will be inspired to try it all for yourself.  I know that I will watch it again and again for information and inspiration.  I also have the companion book.  When you see the techniques from the book in action on the DVD, it provides a great comprehensive experience.",1429747200,9,504,4.533333333333333
