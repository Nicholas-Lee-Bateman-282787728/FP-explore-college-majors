4294210,4,B0049TC8CG,"Excel a maniac. That works for the secret Across organization. Across wants to rule the world. There's no freakin' way that can happen with henchmen that are as insane and as dumb as Excel is. Her partner, Hyatt, is equally hopeless. She has a weak constitution, or anemia, or cancer, or something. She's always spitting up blood and passing out for no apparent reason. Despite these mental and physical handicaps they do do their best. Each episode has a different story going on inside the main plot, which doesn't unfold until the very end. I honestly didn't enjoy it until about half way through. If you watch Excel Saga try not to have any preconceptions or expectations before you start. Don't take it seriously. Enjoy it for what it is; if you can figure out what it is. It's actually not all that bad.",1348876800,2,809,4.625
4294211,5,B0049TC8CG,"This is definitely a must-see for any anime fan. The series doesn't follow the manga's plot, but instead keeps in the sprirt of said manga and parodies anime in general--a gambit that pays off. I'd recommend this series, albeit with a Google search for the cultural notes. I didn't catch all the references the first few times I saw it, but I still enjoyed the series anyway.",1317513600,3,375,4.611940298507463
4294212,2,B0049TC8CG,Excel Saga has been around long enough for you to know about it; so I am leaving this review simplistic and guessing you want to know about this release and not the actual show. This is a passable re-release HOWEVER it is missing the cultural tags which could be found in all previous releases. These tags are essential to understanding much of the humor that is inherent in the Saga. So do not buy this rendition unless you want to miss out on what really makes this show move from mediocre to great.,1315267200,13,501,4.397849462365591
4294213,5,B0049TC8CG,This series was a show that started out in 2002 I saw it with a few college friends back then and thought it was hilarious. I've finally found it and now watch it with new friends and my siblings. Though it is funny it is not recommended for children/teens under 15...simply because of most of the content.,1313884800,6,306,4.385964912280702
4294214,1,B0049TC8CG,"I am a big fan of parodies and dark humor, so I was really hoping that this would be good. Well, the first time around, I hated it. The non-stop babbling squeak-fest that is Excel's dialogue got on my nerves and was at times, almost intolerable. On top of that, laughs were scarce (except for a few moments about keeping a dog alive as a back-up food supply and a villian named ""That Man""!). Sometime After seeing it all the way through, I discovered the existence of ADV Vid Notes on the DVDs and presto! Everything suddenly made sense and the funniness exemplified.

The thing with Excel Saga is that almost all of the humor/parodies in it, can only be picked up with an either an innate understanding of Japanese history/culture, or with these Vid Notes turned on. Trying to laugh without either of these is like driving in the dark with no lights. I cannot stress the importance of this feature enough. The Vid Notes are fascinating, educational and do a good job of clearing up everything so that no joke or parody does un-noticed. But here's the kicker: THE PRECIOUS VID NOTES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BOX SET! You need to buy the individual DVDs or Excel Saga - The Imperfect Collection to get this feature. Thats why I'm giving this 2 stars less than that of Imperfect collection- its that important.

This show mostly focuses on the plotless misadventures of the annoying, blabbermouth Excel and Hyatt, the much quieter girl who basically just dies over and over. But there are side stories concerning a man named Pedro who is trying to win his wife's love back, and Excel's apartment neighbors who become civil servants. There are several crappy episodes, though. I find it very hard to enjoy the two Menchi Adventure episodes, all clips that have anything to do with the civil servants (the Power Ranger costumes they wear are the only thing remotely funny about them) and the two recap episodes. This series is plotless, yet there are recap episodes... sure, one of the characters makes a joke about the stupidity of doing this but that don't change the fact that those episodes suck.

Basically, this is really only worth getting if you can find DVDs with the Vid Notes and you have an incredible tolerance for floods of rapid-fire squeaky dialogue and bad filler.",1306454400,16,2277,4.6875
4294215,5,B0049TC8CG,"This review petrains to the anime as a whole. I cannot review this set as it has not been released at the time of this review.

This series bassed on the manga by Rikudou Koshi is in my opinion a classic that all manga/anime fans should own along with the originol manga (at the time of this review their are 22 volumes of the manga).

This series follow two teenage girls just out of high school, Excel Excel and Hyatt, who are members of a secreet organization ACROSS (named after a center in fukkuoka in Southern Japan) headed by Lord Ilpallazo (the Ilpalazo is a trendy hotel in Japan) intent on domination. They decide to foucuss their efforts on taking over a city, F-City (I assume refers to Fukuokka) as a step to world domination.

It is loaded with parodies of Japanese manga and anime as well as parodies of american movies and comics.

It is an extreamly hillarious comdey spanning 26 eppisodes.

In my opinion any one who is a fan of manga or anime should own both this anime and the manga. The manga in my opinion is even better and has a different story and more characters, though the anime also has originol characters.",1301529600,12,1136,4.468599033816425

8419291,5,B0049TC8CG,"An insane slapstick farce.  This anime was groundbreaking when it came out and still holds up against modern anime scripts.  The animation did not get a modern budget, but the design, colors, exaggerations, and flow still hold up well.  Even thought the English voice over of Excel was amazing, I still prefer the Japanese over the English translation.  Omi Minami's speed of delivery and voice quality are unparalleled.",1454889600,,420,5.132352941176471

8419295,5,B0049TC8CG,Excel Saga was the very first anime I bought back in 2002 and is still my most favorite slapstick comedy anime. To me this is also like the Japans version of South Park because it makes fun of our cultures both Japans and America. Every episode will have you guessing what going to happen next and make you cry and laugh to where you might be shooting sparks out your noise.,1395360000,,374,4.28169014084507
8419296,5,B0049TC8CG,"This is one of those topical series that broke all the rules and tried to super glue them together, hoping you would not notice, but feeling really bad that those rules were in place at all, the series wants to replace the rules with new rules, but knows they will not follow those new rules, resulting in a never ending cycle of rule breaking that will leave everyone wondering what just happened and hungry.

Now, if you read that and thought that was crazy cool. Go buy this series because that is what it is about.",1379289600,3,518,4.395833333333333

8419298,5,B0049TC8CG,This anime I can say met all expectations.  It was just like how I remembered and I can recomend it to anime fans.  In fact a friend also said it was good.,1375228800,,155,3.8125
