8245714,5,B0012ECXJE,"Amazon wants me to review a ""Carry On"" film/DVD.  Simply put it is a Carry On DVD.  Hey either you like them, think they are stupid or like them because they are stupid, or you just don't like British Humor.  Not much else can be said about any of the films.
Shipping and quality are all very satisfactory, price was great!",1331596800,,323,4.262295081967213
