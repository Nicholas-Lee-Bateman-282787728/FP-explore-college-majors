7902538,5,B000003K5P,"For all the people who wanted Beverly Crusher and Jean-Luc Picard to finally come together, this is the video that you've been waiting for. The story starts out as Crusher and Picard beam to the planet Kes-Prytt to negotiate with the even-tempered Kes. However, the Prytt see this act as hostile, and capture both of them. Picard and Crusher navigate out of their cell, on the run to Kes territory. They trek through the planet, and one night, by a campfire, as they are able to read each other's minds because of the devices planet on the base of their necks, Beverly senses that Picard was once in love with her. They discuss this, and Picard admits that he was in love with her, but he was guilty when her former husband, Jack, died. They forget this, and each go to sleep. The next day, Riker negotiates with the Kes and the Prytt, convincing them to let Picard and Crusher beam back without any trouble. Picard and Crusher once again arrive at the Enterprise, and have their often dinner together. Picard asks Crusher if they should move forward from being friends, but Crusher denies, and leaves his quarters.
This was a really good video from the beginning, and in the middle you would think that Crusher and Picard would really get together in view of the discussions they have, but the don't. So, I really can't criticize Paramount, but don't watch this video in high hopes of Crusher and Picard getting together. In spite of all that, ""Attached"" was a really wonderful video.",990489600,7,1485,4.650190114068441
7902539,5,B000003K5P,"When Picard and Crusher are captured on a diplomatic away mission, telepathic enhancing devices are implanted in them, which, given time, will send and receive psi-waves. As they escape together, their telepahic contact grows as time goes by. The episode explores what it would be like to be constantly aware of somebody elses thoughts and dreams, especially if that persons loves you deeply and has done so in a quiet way for 20 years. In this episode Jean-Luc expresses his love for Beverly at long last, because it has no use denying it. There are some very moving scenes, and also some quite hillarious ones, as they slowly learn to live with each others thoughts.
If there ever was a P/C episode, than this is it.",976924800,7,718,4.7063492063492065
7902540,5,B000003K5P,"I have always been a strong supporter of Picard and Crusher and this episode is the one episode you must own if you love Picard and Crusher.  IT was very funny and touching I jsut wish that they had kept going with them instead of putting them on the backburner in the movies.  Riker and Troi are now together maybe, finally, they will get to THe Captain and the Doctor :)",971913600,7,372,4.225352112676056
