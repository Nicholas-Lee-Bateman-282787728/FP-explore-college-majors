8230095,1,B000XXWE2Q,I purchased this movie from Amazon for next to nothing so I was not expecting much. I have to say this is the worst movie I have ever seen. You literally cannot watch this movie and understand anything that is going on. The music soundtrack was terrible and I had to mute the sound several times to keep my sanity. This was the most boring 70 minutes I have ever suffered through. Please don't even consider buying this junk.....THE WORST!,1336780800,,439,4.5
8230096,3,B000XXWE2Q,"A rapist and a killer with a dual personality meet in a restaurant and discuss God, evil and punishment. Logic is misused by one to ""prove"" that you can do anything that you want, because God if he existed wouldn't allow evil.
Part of the film is in black and white, to point out
the kind of actions or thought involved?
The acting is pretty good, but the blood and mayhem is
just not a new thing. It is perverting science and logic to make
these kinds of arguments about God and evil
and call it an art film? I think the God of love and punishment
argument is just as disloyal to theology?
As well meaning as the producers of this film may be,
I think a Taoism point of view that certain
laws of behavior are universal might be better?",1214179200,,736,4.190140845070423
