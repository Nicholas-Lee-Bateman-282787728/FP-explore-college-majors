7871969,4,6304474377,"The title is misleading as this video covers a lot of interesting animals in addition to lions, but its still a great show.  The music, editing and Richard Kiley narration gives it the classic feel of a quality National Geographic production.",1309824000,,242,4.902439024390244
7871970,5,6304474377,"Most of the older National Geographic Specials are real treasures and this film is no different. The wonderful footage, the superb narration and the great soundtrack come together to make this video a really enjoyable experience. It may not be solely about lions like the title implies, but this is part of this film's charm. It explores all aspects related to the life that these lions lead and all of the creatures they have as neighbors.",1228780800,,440,4.802631578947368
7871971,2,6304474377,"This 1987 video follows an unusually large pride of 30 lionesses and cubs in Kruger National Park in South Africa.  That said, only about 10-15 minutes of this 60 minute video actually show lion footage - and that footage is not terribly exciting.

The remaining three quarters of the video are worthwhile for a nature lover, if not for a lion lover - they cover mostly smaller creatures that one normally wouldn't think of making a video for.  Memorable scenes include a small snake that catches and swallows a centipede larger than itself and a spider catching a frog.

If you're specifically looking for lions, though - especially if you want to see them in action as well as in their more common poses of relaxation - I would instead recommend one of the videos of Derek and Beverly Joubert, also from National Geographic.  These include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-s-Lions-of-Darkness/dp/630447525X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic's Lions of Darkness</a>, as well as my personal favorite,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Eternal-Enemies-Lions-and-Hyenas/dp/B000J4QW72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic: Eternal Enemies - Lions and Hyenas</a>, which despite the hyena on the cover has more about lions than hyenas.",1074643200,12,1376,6.538461538461538
7871972,3,6304474377,"This video's title is a little misleading. The video is not only about lions but other creatures of African night. It has interesting footage but a weak story. If you are interested in seeing a great lion documentary from the same region, watch ""Lions of Darkness"" instead.",977788800,8,273,4.829787234042553
7871973,4,6304474377,"There is no world-famous footage here, no lightning-flash illumination of animal behavior that we haven't seen in other tapes, and yet... it's so beautifully filmed and so many popular species are covered as they go  through birth, mating and death that this tape should be brought as an  introduction before others that might have classic footage but are more  narrow in scope.  If you have only one African wildlife video, this should  probably be it.  Look for the lion who's just lost the girl to his buddy -  and is so put out that he ignores another lioness who saunters up and swats  him across the face, as if she's saying ""hey, stupid!""  As with  many other wildlife tapes, you may want to review this one before letting  the younger kids watch.",962928000,10,754,4.636363636363637
