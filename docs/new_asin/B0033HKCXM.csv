4065448,5,B0033HKCXM,"Godspeed is of hope, love lost and redemption. With cathartic effect and incredible intensity, it chronicles pain, solitude, revulsion and graphic violence. Its straightforward narrative - a promiscuous faith healer slams the bottle after his family are slaughtered and retreats into the wilds, only to relive his dark past - is wonderfully complemented by sharp and beautiful widescreen cinematography of the great Alaskan landscape, the windswept natural vistas and the last frontier of god's country. Godspeed is a truly marvellous film, its haunting imagery, fragile and bitter characterisation and stark violence - including an uncomfortable rape scene and the squashing of a skull, crimson and brain matter oozing out like fruit - linger long after the final frame has burned itself into one's retinas. It's an indie masterpiece, angry yet breathtaking cinema with a one-fingered salute to authoritarian moviemaking. Godspeed, with its dominant religious underbelly that ultimately leads to violent consequences, is one of the finest movies in a long time.

4065449,5,B0033HKCXM,"The story of a faith healer who's wife and child is murdered in his home.  He renounces his faith, moves into the woods and is then reunited with the killer in an unsuspecting way.  I got to see this film at a festival and not only is it beautifully shot.... the acting, directing and writing deliver.  A suspense film shot in the vastness of Alaskan scenery where the coldness lends itself to the characters dark despair.",1265155200,4,422,4.526315789473684
4065450,5,B0033HKCXM,"There are numerous movies that call themselves ""Independent."" In fact it's as easy to get an ""Independent"" film onto dvd and on the shelves these days as it is to find a Jean-Claude Van-Damme movie in the $5 and under bin at Best Buy. Naturally, walking in to see this movie, I had that notion in mind- I was expecting an hour and a half distraction that I'd just as quickly forget about, such is the nature with most low budget pictures.

Let me tell you- this film lingered. The quality is top notch and I can ramble off several films who look far less professional than this that are called ""classics."" That is besides the point. This film is beautiful. Sure the acting is great but it best damn well be if you are making a film to compete in the big leagues- that's a given, but where most films fall short is in their production value, and this goes for studio films too. 'Godspeed' however nails it. It makes you want to visit Alaska, makes you want to be there. The Alaska tourism board would be smart to grab some screen shots from this movie and put them to use.

Oh and one more thing- If anyone knows how to reach Cory Knauf, do tell. Please.",1265155200,3,1153,4.284403669724771
4065451,5,B0033HKCXM,This film rocks!!  The story is unusual and dark and convoluted. Delicious!  My friends and I couldn't stop talking about it for days after seeing it. It's one of those films that just stays with you.  The acting is incredible.  The leads in the film are amazing but every role in this movie is played with such care and detail. Truly an ensemble of powerhouse actors. I loved the woman who played Charlie's prostitute. She was vulnerable and damaged yet so charming. Well played! The cinematography is also gorgeous.  Alaska serves as one of the characters in the film.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who supports genuine American independent film.,1265155200,,658,4.830357142857143

4065454,5,B0033HKCXM,"Godspeed is a timeless tale of faith, revenge and redemption. The setting is the beautiful, perpetual daylight of Alaska in summertime, and the sweeping wilderness landscapes only add to the eerie tension and mounting suspense that the film offers. This is not a mindless, blow 'em up, gore-infused action film. It's a slow burn thriller that reads more like a Carson Mccullers story than some big budget, big name, by-the-book suspense film. Bleak, dark, angry, relentless and achingly beautiful. The performances are top notch, nuanced, subtle and profound. Joseph McKelheer and Ed Lauter offer stand-out performances. McKelheer's Charlie seethes with so much, but it's all below the surface, restrained and real and very empathetic. Lauter brings his incredible abilities as a character actor to the table with a man who acts as the voice of clarity, reason and wisdom in a film filled with lost, angry, broken souls.
What else can I say without spoiling it? See this film.",1264982400,,976,5.144654088050315
4065455,5,B0033HKCXM,"A gripping, Shakespeare-style drama of loss and revenge, set amid some of the most beautiful locales on Earth. Just schedule it on your ""indie intense"" night. Cory Knauf plays arguably the best looking religious-nut psychopath in years.",1264982400,,236,5.405405405405405

4065457,5,B0033HKCXM,"I love Lynn Breedlove, and I loved this film. It was well acted, fast-paced, and a great indie film effort.

This DVD is an adaptation of Lynn Breedlove's novel, GODSPEED. It stars Lynn Breedlove herself as Jim, the bicycle riding, free wheeling, punk, drug addict, trans hero of the novel.

Well worth the money.",1211760000,2,313,4.777777777777778
8387999,5,B0033HKCXM,"One often wonders what feeds the depravity of many in our societies. Godspeed provides a look behind the scenes. A frightening and realistic portrayal of one madman, his mindless followers and a sister who tries to ""right"" the senseless slaughter of an innocent mother and child. This story, set in Alaska, is both repulsive and intriguing. The characters touch every emotion we possess.",1405036800,,387,5.158730158730159
8388000,2,B0033HKCXM,Good start to film then it was at a snails pace thereafter with a totally predicable script. Hardly a thriller more a taste of the countryside. Shame as the actors and actresses seemed really good just a boring plot.,1314316800,,216,4.564102564102564
8388001,4,B0033HKCXM,Godspeed was a terrific film! Moves at a slow pace but well worth the wait. Highly recommend this thriller!,1283644800,,107,4.684210526315789
8388002,1,B0033HKCXM,"I'm not sure how such bland films can get high remarks on amazon. I got fooled once when I checked out ""Them""(see that review) and I thought that would be the last of it. Your not fooling me twice I thought no way! So many good reviews and remarks about the film this has to be worth watching...I couldn't have been more wrong.

This movie has such terrible pacing that you'll feel bored out of your mind while watching than anything else. The characters over dramatize every word they say and every action they take. This film could of easily been 60 minutes long if they condensed all that. The first 70 minutes of the film is spent... I'm not sure what to say nothing really happens here. You pretty much watch how the main character lives his life and try to figure out if he's lost his sanity or not.

The later half of the movie moves even slower as you watch the climax...sloooooowly build itself up. Matter of fact it's so slow by the time it happens you pretty much can tell what is going on and what's going to happen. To be honest if you get to 40minutes in this movie and can't figure out everything by than... I'm not sure what to tell you. It's not a good thing when your audience can figure out what's going to happen in a movie where you want to add a suspenseful twist.

I can't really recommend paying to watch this movie. It takes way to long for anything to happen and that's something I never complain about. If you bring me slow action then bring me a good story. You don't mix a slow and mediocre story with even slower action/suspense. It just makes your viewers loose interest in the film. I know I certainly did.

Another thing about this movie is that it tries to be deep. I didn't find anything deep or meaningful in this film. There was nothing mind blowing or interesting about any points they tried to make if any. I've seen better stories with deeper messages on a Bazooka wrapper.

I also hope that if you do watch this film that your the type that doesn't matter if there is no ending. This film moves so slowly that you expect an ending well worth the time you wasted but it never happens. You think you get some reward for sitting all the way through but there isn't one. Absolutely no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow...more like a bill. The ending message where they talk into the credits trying to leave you with a lasting thought was just rambling that didn't make any sense. It just certified this movie as a complete waste of time.

The only good things to note about it is that the red head was pleasing on the eye and the only reason I didn't take this out the dvd player.

Bottom Line: Extremely slow story pace,Predictable story,and pretentiousness = not worth watching if your paying for it.

1 Star for a boring film.",1282089600,,2771,4.335907335907336
8388003,4,B0033HKCXM,"When faith is twisted the mistakes of its interpretation can lead to tragedy of Biblical proportions. Robert Saitzyk's ""Godspeed"" explores what happens when people's faith and beliefs conflict, even though at first glance they seem to be of the same cloth.

Charlie Shepard (Joseph McKelhar) is a faith healer in an unnamed one prostitute town in Alaska. Charlie's problem is he doesn't have any faith. He had one night in his life where he touched the ineffable that gave him his faith, but he knows he isn't helping anyone. He seems more in search of that original feeling of faith then those that come looking to him for faith.

One night Charlie's wife and son are murdered and Charlie's life is thrown into further despair. So much so that he's scratching out sections of the Bible, altering the passages to reflect his philosophy of life. One morning Charlie meets Sarah (Courtney Halverson), who met Charlie briefly in his career as a faith healer. She needs Charlie ostensibly because her father is deteriorating after the death of his wife. Charlie follows Sarah out into the wilderness of Alaska to discover that Sarah's brother Luke (Cory Knauf) is preaching his own doctrine of faith to a fledgling group of Manson like disciples.

The characters could have been stereotyped. Charlie could have been a fire and brimstone preacher, but McKelher brings a quiet nuance to the character and as events unfold we care about what happens to him. The role of Sarah could have been a throw away role, but Saitzyk brings out the complexity of Sarah who in other hands might have been seen as a character with simple motivations that provide the catalyst for the action.

""Godspeed"" is a cool film. Not in terms of it's hipness, but in terms of how the characters act and director Saitzyk allows the story to unfold. And when the thriller elements of the movie emerge, they emerge naturally out of the actions and motivations of the characters and they don't need to throw in a chase scene for the sake of a chase scene.

The setting of Alaska also works to define the characters. The scenery is as wide open as the characters are to finding a new faith, but those characters are also presumably as empty as the vast spaces of the wilderness.

""Godspeed"" may not be for everyone. It has its own intensity, and it's a thriller that demands you pay attention to it. No scene is wasted, no action is unnecessary. When you're finished watching it you may need a little time to absorb all that has happened.

DVD Special Features: The bonus features offers a better than usual commentary by director Robert Saitzyk, a small behind the scenes feature, and interviews with the cast members.",1281052800,4,2684,4.759139784946236
8388004,4,B0033HKCXM,I loved the slow thickly paced tension. I thought the film beautifully shot and the scenery added to the mood perfectly.  It's a revenge movie with a twist and it is very disturbing.  I like disturbing.  It felt a little like a modern day western but layered with emotion.  Check it out.,1271808000,,287,4.461538461538462

8388006,5,B0033HKCXM,"The subject matter of this indie film, the beautiful Alaskan scenery, the acting, and the whole ""feel"" of this movie is extremely affecting.  You will think about it long after the end.  Without giving anything away, it's certainly not a light hearted film, but superbly done, thought provoking, and some of the more disturbing scenes will stay with you for days.  The three lead actors, Joe McKelheer, Cory Knauf and Courtney Halverson give top notch performances, and Jessie Ward, who plays Rebecca, portrays a haunted, tragic character who you will think about throughout the story.  This is a must-see.",1267315200,,606,5.090909090909091
8388007,5,B0033HKCXM,"Considering this film was made on a tight budget in under a month, the production of this film is right up there with a big budget picture. The writing, directing, acting and cinematography is superb. Unlike most Hollywood blockbusters, Godspeed is not a film for everyone. If you're squeamish, you definitely don't want to see this film. The Alaskan setting gives it a spooky feel and it will stick with you long after viewing it. It's one of those types of psychological films that comes full circle. It's definitely worth seeking out.",1266192000,,537,4.8478260869565215
8388008,2,B0033HKCXM,"Seeing this movie in the theater, I was expecting a good show, being some of the cast was from an entertaining movie (The Hamiltons), the director has shown some promise with his past works, and it's all based in the great state of ALASKA. While I have a ton of respect for any independent filmmaker, this was a movie full of holes and a ton of 'not quite there's'.

My hat off to the cast and crew for the effort. But. I'm sorry to say, this movie was poorly acted and poorly directed. The performances were hardly believable. Especially the scenes with Cory Knauf. While I really enjoyed his performance in The Hamilton's, this was just not a suitable role for him. Speaking of unsuitable roles, Our main guy Joseph McKelheer. Just like Cory, a totally unsuitable role. But there comes a time when the excuses for poor acting runs thin, so where to blame? Well it's the direction. For  a director to allow some of those very poor scenes executed on film, is beyond me. It seemed as though the director was content with whatever his actors gave him, without considering a few thing such as oh I don't know... decent performances. And don't get me started on the script. Is one so inclined to write something as poor as this and say, 'I should make this into a feature'. It was like watching a first year film student have access to some great equipment and crew, grab his buddies and say, 'lets make a movie'.

Godspeed did prove one thing. While the image was great, this goes to show the importance of talent and direction, which sorry to say, was desperately lacking.",1265846400,2,1571,4.524647887323944
