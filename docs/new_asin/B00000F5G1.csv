1202539,5,B00000F5G1,"Well done TV dramatic police movie. Thoughtful acting by Martin Sheen as a grief stricken detective in search of the Son Of Sam killer in NYC. A tribute to a good cop in a rough case, and it's Sheen's in depth character study that raised the bar in making things true and real. Watch for Joe Spinell a live wire suspect in the films best scenes. Fresh film making.",1417910400,,364,4.2898550724637685

SYNOPSIS
After 24 years of service, Eddie Zigo's a Grade 2 detective. He'd like to retire as Grade 1, feels he's earned it, but there's a promotion freeze in effect. Further, his daughter's preparing to go off to college in a few months and wife Ann has fallen seriously ill. When a number of related nighttime shootings occur, anonymous letters from a professed killer calling himself ""the Monster""and ""Son of Sam"" are sent to NYPD. With the enticement of a possible promotion to Det. 1st Grade, Zigo is asked to join a ""Sam"" task force. He's forced to choose between a career dream and caring for a seriously ill loved one.

1202542,5,B00000F5G1,"Everything about this film feels authentic.  Police work is not glory and macho theatrics here.  It's daily drudge and trudge and the toll it takes on a hard-working officer's personal life can be enormous.  Sheen's character has a serious struggle with his religious faith also.  The best part of this movie is when he finally locates David Berkowitz and leads the capture.  Instead of getting tough, Det. Zigo and his fellow officers are all nervous and jumpy and don't want to make a mistake.",1307923200,,495,4.845238095238095

1202544,5,B00000F5G1,"This film is one for the record books. Martin Sheen plays a real life officer tracking down ""SON OF SAM"". I have to say this is a wonderful motion picture which was only on TV for a while. If you like David Fincher's Zodiac, please pick this movie up you will love it. It might not be as dark as the Zodiac but it comes pretty darn close to it.

I watch this 4 times now and its a great film.",1222041600,3,392,3.8395061728395063

The Son of Sam. It took a terrible crime & told you about it a way that was interesting. It changed the names but followed very close to the truth & the best part is when they catch him.
