7887095,2,6305299994,"In the year 2250, the earth is uninhabitable with poisonous radioactive air. Most of the human population lives on asteroids. A company mines scrap metal on the planet utilizing the ""Pokies"" who apparently hail from Native American casino owners. The science fiction aspect was interesting, unfortunately they imposed an old story with the all too familiar twist.

Jerry Paul (Ron Perlman) is a strong arm bully who runs the operation. Harvey Denton (Stephen Lang) is the gutless sheriff who allows Jerry Paul to push him around. There is a shortage of water and hostility between the ""Pokies""and the ""humans."" Jerry accuses Tommy Tall Bear (Zahn McClarnon) of raping his wife (Barbara Jane Reams) and forms a vigilante mob to make sure Tommy never reaches trial. At this point you can write the rest, including the twist.

Gabriel Olds plays a reporter doing a story on the operation. Other than infuse plot points with a boring monotone, he served no purpose.

This was a made for TV film, written by Rod Serling, who has done better.",1391731200,,1036,4.908571428571428
7887096,5,6305299994,"This is a little known treasure.  Too bad it never attained cult status.  Derivative story of predudice and hate, but very well done and very gripping.",1374969600,,151,4.769230769230769
7887097,5,6305299994,"Two hundred years in the future, in a radioactive scrap metal mining town on the almost completely abandoned, draught ridden, dying planet Earth, a young man of a ""second class race"" is lynched for the supposed beating and attempted rape of the wife of the town boss before he can be taken off planet to the new home of humanity for trial. The act exhumes an old guilt that begins the final disintegration of a town already half buried in the ugly dust of racism and prejudice.

Steven Lang does an excellent job as the useless, haunted town drunk and Sheriff Harvey Denton. The ""Cain and Abel-ish"" brother like relationship between his character and Ron Perlman's (superbly done) town boss and mob ring leader Jerry Paul is well done by both actors. You can see it there dying, being killed by time, guilt, booze and power. The abusive love-hate relationship between Jerry Paul and his wife Maya (Barbara Jane Reams) is very realistic, scary in its unhealthy depths of possession and desire to care and be cared for.

The DVD unfortunately does not have the making of documentary.",1103760000,,1081,4.74468085106383
7887098,3,6305299994,"While this initially comes off as a ""Twilight Zone""-style morality play, shifting a thinly-disguised Western setting into a science fiction setting, it should be pointed out that this film is quite far removed from Rod Serling's original.  In fact, the Amazon reviewer's statement that Serling's script was ""unproduced"" is not strictly true.
""A Town Has Turned To Dust"" was a television play written in the 1950s, the heyday of live television drama (I can't recall if this was a Playhouse 90 offering).  Serling's original script focused on a real-life case involving the lynching of an African-American man, with the complicity of local law enforcement officials.  The network feared that this was too inflamatory and controversial to be produced in Serling's original form, so it was rewritten extensively.  The version that *was* produced and aired in the 1950s changed the setting to New Mexico in the late 1800s, and changed the victim's character from African-American to Mexican immigrant.  Rod Steiger played the local sheriff.
Rod Serling was extremely upset about these alterations, and felt that they had gutted his story, putting too much distance between audience and subject.  The ""old West"" setting, in his opinion, dulled the impact and relevance that his play was intended to have.  The play, as written, was not ""allegory"" at all -- it was a somewhat fictionalized retelling of recent (or current) events, whose impact came from its *contemporary* relevance.
I can't help wondering what Serling would have thought of this recent version, which now has two thick layers of reworking.  It is no longer a ""1950s lynching placed in a Western setting"", it is now a ""1950s lynching placed in a Western setting and moved to a Science Fiction setting.""  The setting -- and  the relevance -- of Serling's original have been distanced even further from his original intention.  In drawing the play further and further from its intended context, Serling's voice is increasingly muted.",975628800,8,1992,5.19375
