3952033,5,B002M9FXGI,this one keeps you laughing and it fun all way through the movie .well worth buying if can find it .,1389830400,,100,3.8095238095238093
3952034,5,B002M9FXGI,"This a is a funny family type movie, with a story about a Mother who's working on getting her sons together for Christmas. and the problems that occur. It has a great cast, especially when you put together Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, along with Ruth Buzzi from laugh in.",1387238400,,272,4.46
3952035,5,B002M9FXGI,movie does not play in my dvd ..very upset the amazon agent i spoke with assured me it was english and would play in my DVD player.  I also ordered 2 movies but only received 1.  The cover of the movie is all spanish.  Very disappointed with Amazon.,1384646400,,249,4.145833333333333
3952036,1,B002M9FXGI,"I had seen this video on TV years ago and the story is quite funny, but this DVD recording is absolutely worthless for viewing. So much loud static noise, the audio is hard to hear.",1371081600,,181,4.2
3952037,5,B002M9FXGI,"The Trinity boys back for Christmas! You can never really have enough Christmas westerns. John Wayne's ""3 Godfathers"" is a great one. Chuck Norris did a version for ""Walker: Texas Ranger"". And if you like the Trinity movies and the Hill/Spencer collaborations, you'll enjoy this! Though different characters, they live up to their Trinity western personas with some new gags and nods to previous ones. Filmed in the early '90s, they bring about an emphasis on family (much like the recent Indiana Jones movie).",1359331200,,510,5.083333333333333
3952038,3,B002M9FXGI,"Very funny,but corny in some parts. Good but not as good as the Trinity movies. The end fight scene is a little long,but funny. Terence Hill has been better,but he's still good.",1330905600,4,177,4.5625
3952039,5,B002M9FXGI,"For us Trinity fans we find here a much older pair (1994) but equally charming and entertaining.  Ruth Buzzi appears as their mother in a storyline that is reminiscent of their slapstick days.  As usual, the pair are brothers, with Spencer's character being completely disdainful of Hill's.  The bad guys are just as hilarious and comical as are the situations.  Spencer is adorable as the immensely strong and quietly spoken brother who bounty hunts to support loads of kids.  Two women who rehab wildlife allow an interesting angle to the story.  All around, another great movie and definitely a must have addition to any Trinity collection.",1309564800,8,643,5.018867924528302

8373643,5,B002M9FXGI,"Their best movie (after the two Trinitys) ever!!!  This DVD was very crisp picture-wise, just wished there were sub-titles.  But this movie was a definite final homage to their earlier pictures together.  Great for kids and adults, and a good Christmas theme to boot.  Bud Spencer died in June of 2016 and the world is a sadder place without him.",1470268800,3,346,4.716666666666667
