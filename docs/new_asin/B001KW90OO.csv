8316312,2,B001KW90OO,"I was sad watching the film ""Forbidden Fruits"" in which Arab Americans and African Americans were fighting with each other tooth and nail.  It was fun watching ""100% Arabica"" in which French Blacks and French Arabs seemed to mix and mingle just fine.  In this doc, Samuel, a Black guy, works out with his Arab buddies in the weight room.  In ""The Best of Francois Sagat Part One,"" Lebanese Francois and Turkish Huessein get busy with a ebony-chocolate brotha and it rocks!  This is like a G-rated version of that.  If you like black-and-brown mixing, then this is for you!

Like most muscleman videos, this is all training and very little dialogue.  The red envelope said Silvio speaks of ton of languages and has an engineering degree.  Although he epitomizes ""All that and brains too,"" you don't get to hear him discuss his skills.  He does pose in his speedoes at least once and some viewers may just want to fastforward to that seen.",1263945600,,937,4.664634146341464
