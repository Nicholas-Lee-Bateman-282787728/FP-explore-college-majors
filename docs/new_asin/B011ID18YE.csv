7333016,5,B011ID18YE,"Taxi scene I didn't was cut but made it in as a passenger in the terminal with a denim jacket on the first day of shooting . I loved this movie because the story has a great message about global warming and how it s affecting the life of the inhabitants of the North Pole , and how if we don t change our energy usage we will impact this great planet we live on . The acting was real good and having meet Theo on his first day he was a genuine great man . I liked Dakota Johnsons character she was fun and gave a great performance . GO SOLAR and WIND on your house and in your town . Let's make this our mission . One person at a time . Recycle and plant food crops instead of lawns . Be like THEO and walk . And see how one person s will can save this earth.",1441497600,2,759,3.75

7333019,5,B011ID18YE,"This movie was really good, I was very excited to see Alaska on the screen even though it was in the beginning, and the message of the movie was clear",1455926400,,150,4.033333333333333
7333020,1,B011ID18YE,"One of the worst movies.  I'm so sorry I bought this one as I seldom purchase dvds.  I can't say one good thing about it.  The acting was almost intolerable, except for the eskimo.  I believed him.",1453680000,,197,4.243243243243243
7333021,5,B011ID18YE,"Theo Ikummaq stars in this film that is based on a true story of his life.  The telling of his tale is supported by Dakota Johnson and Mira Sorvino with a cameo of Larry King portraying himself.

This is a film for all ages, and was not made for children (I don't know why one reviewer would think that; see IMDb).  It is a powerful message, beautifully written, with a few layers for discussion afterwards: are we too late?  are we imprisoning ourselves? *and most importantly* how many ways can a message be delivered (in conversation, in music, on youtube, in a park, at the UN... and through THIS movie...!)  Theo's message is being delivered every time this movie is viewed.  So view it and tell your friends.

This is a subtle film well done, artistic and wise.  It has its audience.  If you are looking for ""Coming to America"" like comedy regarding Theo's encounter with New York City, this film has gone over your head.  This is a message told in story form so that it is entertaining; it's not mindless escapist entertainment (I do love ""Coming to America"", but the comparison is apples and oranges.)
If you are green and looking for uplifting and wise, gentle and inspirational, then this is a good movie for you.",1452297600,,1223,4.568807339449541
7333022,5,B011ID18YE,"Superb acting from Dakota Johnson (as usual) with a great, heartwarming story what earned my tears from laughter and sadness, too. Truly amazing!",1449360000,,145,5.3478260869565215
7333023,4,B011ID18YE,Good movie with a great message.,1448582400,,32,4.5
7333024,4,B011ID18YE,"Very touching.  Moments of not understanding this Girl on the street, or how this Man from the North gets to the city...this message should be heard by all of us.  The last part of the Movie is the most lasting impression and so very true.",1447027200,2,239,4.288888888888889
7333025,3,B011ID18YE,"Chloe & Theo has the look of a made for school curriculum to play in the classroom of little kids to teach about global warming, it's affect on communities such as those dependent on ice, and a learn a bit about the indigenous people of the Arctic.  Chloe who is the main character of the movie and the other New York homeless characters don't really look like they've spent any time on the streets, Dakota Johnson just has some dirt smeared across her face, doesn't brush her hair and wears an old army jacket.  Her and the others live in some secret passage to get to hidden large space that would have most kids, going, ""cool, that would make an awesome secret hangout"".

The character of Theo was a fish out of water, in the tradition of Crocodile Dundee, Coming to America and many other movies, but really failed to capture a character discovering and being shocked by the waste and lifestyle of ""the people of the south"", let alone with coming across technology and other city things he would never have seen before.  Other than the interaction with the mime there were also a lot of missed opportunities for humour in the interaction and discovery moments.  The movie was pretty slow paced, and you were wondering how dumb the New York characters were that they couldn't work out why New York was the city he was sent to, to talk to the world's elders. Why those who sent him didn't tell Theo either is a bit odd. Theo wasn't always the easiest to understand and although I was surprised that this kids movie ended with the scene it did, I had thought a number of times that if this was real, that's exactly what would happen, so I'll rate this one an extra star for putting that scene in there.",1446854400,4,1703,4.463022508038585
7333026,5,B011ID18YE,I loved it! I wasn't expecting it to end that way but it was a great film. I will have to purchase it.,1445558400,,102,3.4782608695652173

8724232,5,B011ID18YE,"The North is melting, and soon, we in the ""South"" will know it too...
You don't have to buy this movie, but you should find a way to watch it.  It has simple messages; respect the land; respect life, and don't be wasteful.  The Polar Ice Caps are melting, we don't see it so much, yet.  But, the Inuit does.  Their Elders have sent us a messenger - Theo, with a warning and a plea.  Of course, who in New York City will listen, except a group of homeless people.  Once a discarded and aimless lot, they learned to gain purpose in Theo's warning and band together to help him get his message to the world - through the UN.  Each is an eccentric character, from Chloe to Theo, ""Sweat"" to Dr. ""Monica"", played by the gorgeous Mira Sorvino.  Perhaps Monica may be the oddest character of all, one with the power and the compassion to want to help.  And, pass along the Inuit's message they did, however not in the way you may think.  Although the movie ends without letting us know what becomes of her, I can't help but believe that her life will be improved by not wanting to seek something for herself, but having a desire to do something for others.  There's also s few homage quotes from the great Bruce Lee, what's not to like about this movie?  And that actress who plays Chloe, I have a sneaky suspicion that she will go far in this business.  While this may be one of Dakota Johnson's earlier roles, at least she's not scavenging a post-apocalyptic wasteland with a talking dog...",1528070400,,1484,4.372262773722627
