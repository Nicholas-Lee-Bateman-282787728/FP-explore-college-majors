4661658,5,B005DRNUDE,"This DVD set contains 3 DVDs. Total playing time is 5 1/2 hours. They provide good overviews of Nikon cameras (D3000, D3100, D5000, D5100 and D7000) while highlighting their features. Several professional photographers are providing useful tips. When you buy a camera you are limited to its own features. Those professionals advice you how to use those features effectively. You will learn how to best compose the shot, set your camera, make the most out of your camera. These videos are wonderful starting guides for a novice.
