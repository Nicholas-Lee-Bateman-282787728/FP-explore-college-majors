1669702,5,B00005UWBH,"Unfortunately, I missed it on Broadway, but now have been able to enjoy it over and over again. Excellent cast with George Hern, Carol Burnette. THERE ARE NO WEAK LINKS IN THIS CAST!!!! Great way to enjoy some of Sondheim's best scores!!!",1233187200,,238,4.690476190476191
1669703,5,B00005UWBH,"""Putting It Together"" is a gem for any fan of musical theater (especially Sondheim fans). The songs are amazing, and all are beautifully delivered; this is a thoroughly enjoyable DVD. Plus, it has Captain Jack Harkness of 'Torchwood' - what more could you ask for? ;-)",1210809600,,268,4.8478260869565215
1669704,5,B00005UWBH,"This is a musical delight I can't stop watching and singing along to! The cast is outstanding. Bronson Pinchot and Carol Burnett will have you rolling with laughter (and so will John Barrowman if you watch the outtake!). Witty, well choreographed, and with an intricately-designed set, Putting It Together is one surprise after another. John Barrowman delights with flashy moves and soulful singing, as does Ruthie Henshall, who has shenanigans of her own up her sleeve. Last but not least, George Hearn is spot-on as the aging husband who looks upon his life with some regret over the past, zeal for the present, and hope for the future.

It's a party, and we're all invited!",1207699200,,676,4.878260869565217
1669705,5,B00005UWBH,John Barrowman and Carol Burnett are in great form! the entertaining is great. John Barrowman is great multi-talented entertainer and needs to be reconised more here in the US.,1200182400,,176,5.103448275862069
1669706,4,B00005UWBH,"Very entertaining. Bronson Pinchot was very funny. I'm partial to John Barrowman, so of course I found him to be wonderful. What a voice! I love it when he belts out those notes as clear as a bell. Even with the rest of the cast on stage, he still manages to take command with his sheer presence.

One small, suggestive scene, otherwise good for all family ages.",1197504000,,362,4.402985074626866
1669707,5,B00005UWBH,"I found this DVD to be wonderful from start to finish.  To be honest, I purchased it because I am a great fan of John Barrowman, but found I enjoyed all the members of this cast.  Each performer has their own separate strengths which make this very watchable.  I only wish there were additional special features, but the one blooper that is included is a riot!  Enjoy!",1192838400,,368,4.447761194029851
1669708,5,B00005UWBH,"Having watched this DVD only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting .The tour de force of Sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed.  The highlight for me was Carol Burnett and the hilarious performance of ""Everyone needs a Maid"" Only Carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour.

I do recommend this dvd  and I look forward to veiwing the disc again  on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner.",1173312000,10,500,4.123711340206185
1669709,4,B00005UWBH,"Musical revues can be quite tricky.  When a show celebrates the talents of a particular composer, having the material performed out of context is usually not a problem for the works of lesser composers.  But in the case of Stephen Sondheim, it is very hard to appreciate the full force of his amazingly deft and intelligent lyrics (not to mention his subtle melodies) when the individual pieces are removed from the show for which they were written.  I have seen, or at least heard, many, many musical revues of Mr. Sondheim's works.  Sometimes they succeed brilliantly, but because of the high caliber of the material and intellectual connection with the source work, the producer and director of any musical revue of Sondheim must be very cautious.  For these reasons, among others, I did not find this production of Putting It Together to be as completely satisfying as it should have been.  And, as a Sondheim ""purist"", the first strike against this production was the fact that some of the lyrics were changed, which is always guaranteed to get me off on the wrong foot, at least, when dealing with Sondheim.

It has long been my considered opinion that, artistically, Mr. Sondheim can do no wrong.  At his worst (if such a word could ever be applied to his output) he writes circles around every other Broadway composer of the 20th century.  But, out of context, his material does not always come across, particularly his later works, which almost always require the accompaniment of the various subtle melodies that he intricately weaves throughout the course of any one show.  Combining material from more than one Sondheim effort is risky, as his ""voice"" is never the same in any two successive theatre pieces, let alone five or ten.  This is the true mark of a genius; the Grand Guignol atmosphere of Sweeney Todd cannot be expected to mix easily with the delicate waltzes of A Little Night Music, let alone the broad slapstick of Forum, the ""70's Mod feel"" of Company, the serious celebration of the artistic process that is Sunday In the Park With George, or the heartbreaking, stark nostalgia of Follies.  From the tricky lyrics of West Side Story, through the folly of Anyone Can Whistle and right up through the achingly beautiful prose of Passion, it is best to experience Sondheim in the context of a complete piece.  Not that it can't be done, mind you, but it is oh so tricky an undertaking to mix his bananas with his grapefruit.

The cast of this show are consummate professionals all, who, for the most part, are up to the task of interpreting Sondheim as he should be: minimally.  Any amount of over dramatization or gesticulation in a Sondheim number will ruin it - his words are simply too powerful, too potent and too direct.  I steadfastly believe that, in order to present Sondheim correctly, all any actor need do is simply sing his words.  They take care of themselves, thank you, and do not require the slightest embellishment to maintain their brilliance.  Exquisite diamonds rarely require magnifying glasses.

One of the problems, for me, is the tendency in musical revues to rely heavily on material that was cut from completed works.  Whole evenings have been structured around Sondheim's ""rejects"".  There are those who insist, and not without some merit, that the songs that Sondheim discards on his way to a finished piece are frequently superior to the final product proffered by certain other composers.  True to a point, but I always like to think that there is a reason why songs are cut, and it's not always just because they don't quite fit.  For example, there are those who think that the song, Happily Ever After, which was replaced by Being Alive in Company, is just as good as the final choice.  I don't agree.  Nevertheless, I don't object to a certain amount of ""cut"" songs in a Sondheim review, as long as they don't overpower the real stuff.  After all, the finished scores for Follies, Sweeney Todd and Company alone could yield enough songs for a full evening's entertainment.  Why do we need to ""celebrate"" Mr. Sondheim's rejects?

As for the performers here, let's start with George Hearn, who is easily one of the most successful interpreters of Sondheim to come along in the past 25 years.  After replacing Len Cariou in the role of Benjamin Barker, Mr. Hearn so completely placed his stamp on the character of Sweeney Todd that many people erroneously believe him to have originated the role.  Of course, there was nothing wrong with Mr. Cariou's performance, but Mr. Hearn established himself as the definitive Barker / Todd through the wonderful PBS production and subsequent DVD that was released several years ago.  Here, as always, he often speaks as much as he sings, but there is an underlying comprehension and simplicity to his presentation that other actor / singers frequently fail to realize while performing Sondheim.  His comfort level with the song, The Road You Didn't Take, from Follies, is such that you want to see him tackle the role of Ben, and his simple and poignant understating of Old Friends is no less skillful than his marvelously dry, deliciously comic reading of Have I Got A Girl For You.

As for the rest of the cast, well, Bronson Pinchot was a revelation.  His perfect rendition of Buddy's Blues was the best I've seen since the original production of Follies closed in 1971.  I saw that show three times during its original Broadway run, and I never expect to see the like of it again.  Mr. Pinchot is in perfect character for every number assigned here, and he is truly a joy to behold.  Just as able throughout were the performances of Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman; Mr. Barrowman in particular sang with a sweet, clear voice, and he presented himself as sophisticated, handsome and poised throughout the evening.

This brings me to the performer that impressed me least - Carol Burnett.  Throughout the 1960's and early 1970's, I was a great fan of her hilarious slapstick antics, as presented on her television show.  I have also been aware for years of her fascination with Sondheim, but I just don't think that she has what it takes to do him justice.  I saw her perform The Ladies Who Lunch on her variety show in the early 1970's - it left me cold then, and her rendition of it has not change one bit.  She simply tries too hard to put it over, when all it needs is to be presented.  Her performance of the biting, satiric classic, Could I Leave You, is even worse.  Once again, her overreaching chews up the scenery completely, without managing to milk a single laugh from one of the great comedic songs of Mr. Sondheim's output!  I will say that she succeeds a bit more with Getting Married Today, although she admits in the interview segment that she slowed it down.  Of course, part of the charm of the original was the manic pace that Beth Howland brought to the song, and admittedly, the breakneck speed of the original would prove difficult for all but the most highly-skilled vocalist to match, let alone a woman of Miss Burnett's maturity.  Carol Burnett's duet with Ruthie Henshall, Always A Woman, a wonderful song cut from Anyone Can Whistle, was quite funny, but with material like this it's hard not to be funny.  Miss Burnett came across best for me on her rendition of Everybody Ought To Have A Maid, even though she destroyed the melody.

Finally, to read some of the reviews here, you would think that Carol Burnett's ""blooper"", which appears as a DVD bonus, was the funniest thing ever filmed before a camera.  Sorry.  This is Sondheim - the wit of his glorious lyrics should be the focus and main source of the laughs here, and I frankly don't believe that whoopee-cushion humor mixes at all well with the sophistication of Mr. Sondheim's wit.

Nevertheless, I give the production four stars, mainly for the material and George Hearn.  If you want to hear the perfect Sondheim revue, check out the CD of the 1973 recording of Sondheim Evening: A Musical Tribute.",1168300800,9,7991,4.744573082489146
1669710,5,B00005UWBH,"Stephen Sondheim's Putting It Together rocks! The music leaves you in awe the cast is surely the best revival of the class show I love John Barrowman's version's of Marry Me A Little, Pretty Women, of course his short song That's The Answer For me. Ruthie Henshall surely pulls off some of the most diffculust songs my favorties from her are I Always Get My Men, Lovely, More, and Unworthy Of Your Love. George Hern numbers are slow and steady that's how I like them favorties from him that I like are Hello Little Girl, Rich And Happy, and What Do You Want To Get Married For? Carol Burnett's are comical and stunning especially her versions of I'm Not Getting Married Today, How Could I Leave You?, Lovely, and My Husaband The Pig. Bronson Pinchot is one of the best for last his best numbers are Bang! and that's all! The best group numbers are Being Alive, Putting It Together, Let The Good Times Roll, Rich and Happy # 4. My favortie cast member is John Barrowman he is a stud, golden-voice, well dressed, perfect hair actor. Being Alive is such a good number in the production nobody can pull off five people singing at once and we can still hear what they are singing. Beside the Music and The Cast the blooper sounds very funny John Barrowman laughing and kicking his heels up after Carol's strap broke right on stage. Buy the DVD it is a guarntee that you won't be sorry if you do.",1055808000,6,1390,4.43359375
1669711,5,B00005UWBH,"Other than commercally successful Sondheim (Send In The Clowns), or West Side Story, this show opened my eyes and heart to a whole new world of beauty, humor, poignancy and wisdom. The song I could not turn away from was Good Thing Going; when Carol Burnett teared up clasping George Hearn's hands singing Old Friends my heart understood; the exquisite depth of Every Day A Little Death; the lyrics, the actors, especially Burnett and Hearn, the wise, warm and compassionate way the bittersweet experiences of Life and Love and Loss are offered: in listening, the heart swells, in understanding, the heart expands.",1042070400,2,614,5.029411764705882

This creative musical revue is one of the newer incarnations of ""Side By Side By Sondhem,"" and has performances by some very gifted stage performers, and starring the musical comedy legend, Carol Burnett.

The cast is fantastic, and the show is a short but fun adventure. Pinchot's ""Buddy's Blues"" is hilarious and Barrowman's duet with Henshall for Assassin's ""Unworthy of Your Love"" is beautiful while somehow eerie. Its worth a buy at under $10. Just don't think you are getting the same story as the 1994 version!",1368316800,,547,4.48

1669722,4,B00005UWBH,"While my primary reason for purchasing was the show itself, I looked forward to the DVD extras mentioned in earlier reviews.  I was disappointed to find the version I received (I ordered the more expensive option) has no extras, just the show itself.  I still enjoyed watching five talented performers put their unique spin on Sondheim songs, but part of me wonders what I've missed.",1321660800,2,383,4.876923076923077
1669723,4,B00005UWBH,"I just received this dvd and I will first say that if you are Sondheim fan, you will probably like this.

I also have to admit that I am a bit disappointed.  I had heard about the blooper with Carol Burnett's skirt and was really looking forward to seeing it as several reviews mentioned that it was on the dvd as an extra.

It wasn't.

Now, I don't know if it's because there are two different versions of this dvd on Amazon.com, one selling for $8.97 and one selling for $18.97 (or thereabouts) and the more expensive version is the one with the extras?

I will say that having the exact same reviews on both versions makes it impossible to tell for sure.

I love Carol Burnett and one of the reasons I picked up this dvd was that blooper...and now I kind of wish I hadn't since the blooper isn't there (and none of the other extras as well).

And that's why I knocked off a star. (It would have only been a 1/2 a star, but Amazon doesn't let you review like that.)",1308700800,4,967,4.194594594594594

1669725,5,B00005UWBH,The entire cast is memorable in this adaptation of Sondheim.  John Barrowman is just incredible as is Carol Burnett. I remember this showing originally on HBO and liked it then.  The only thing better would have been Bernadette!,1301529600,,228,4.973684210526316
1669726,5,B00005UWBH,"""Putting it Together"" (2002) is a very entertaining, fast-moving musical review with five talented performers, innovative staging and, of course, the great music of Stephen Sondheim. Carol Burnett proves again her talents as a gifted singer who can belt them out like Ethel Merman and is a hilarious clown. George Hearn's voice is outstanding, and the chemistry and the character by-play that he and Burnett develop is an extraordinary achievement.
Bronson Pinchot adds his comic talents to the proceedings and throughout introduces one-word themes to the show like ""Revenge"", ""Competition"", ""Seduction"", etcetera, which gives the show a plot line. Rounding out the five are Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman who play the good-looking romantic team.
The music at the beginning seems unfamiliar, and the way the Sondheim songs are seamlessly integrated is another fine achievement. Sondheim wrote a few movie scores such as one for ""Dick Tracy"". In this review there are 35 musical selections.
It was taped before a live audience in the Biltmore Theater in New York. You're going to recognize the music from various Sondheim shows, but here they're given a new twist. The title ""Putting It Together"" is taken from ""Sunday in the Park with George"". As far as I can tell there is no CD of this particular review, although there is a CD for the 1993 version of the show starring Julie Andrews.
The show demonstrates the amazing versatility of Sondheim and the way he dabbled in various modes. The lyrics to the songs show the brilliance, the wit, and the creativity of the composer/lyricist.
Burnett does a fine version of ""Here's to the Ladies Who Lunch"". At the end the ensemble does a great job with ""Being Alive"" and ""Old Friends"".
There's some extra material on this DVD which is very good. There's a blooper, a show-stopper, when Carol's skirt starts falling off. The interview with her is very good. She started in ""Once Upon a Mattress."" She says that most Sondheim songs are like three-act plays and often have a twist ending.",1286582400,3,2032,4.979411764705882
1669727,5,B00005UWBH,"I loved this whole show, I only wish there was a soundtrack for this version of the show and not the older one with julie Andrews, everyone was amazing, i downloaded the original versions of the songs from the shows they were originally in and it just doesn't have the same feeling",1263081600,,281,4.423076923076923
1669728,5,B00005UWBH,"I first saw parts of the show on youtube and fell in love with it because Ruthie Henshall was in it and she is really amazing!!! I had to buy the dvd just to see what the other songs were like. The show is unbelievably entertaining. I read reviews saying that there's no plot. Well if you watch the songs fit together perfectly. or example ""Hello, Little Girl"" ""My Husband The Pig/Everyday a Little Death"" & ""Everybody Ought To Have a Maid"" show that the older man wanted to get with the younger girl but the older woman saw it and is disgusted so she gets a maid to cheat with. I thought that was a clever, Considering they are only using Sondheim songs!!! The actors did a great job Bronson Pinchot was unbelievable especially on ""Bang!"" & ""Buddy's Blues"" John Barrowman has a beautiful voice as displayed in his duet with Ruthie ""Unworthy Of Your Love"" Ruthie Henshall did amazing i hate when people say  that she sings through her teeth, she only really does it in ""Lovely"" but she does have great teeth. Also her perormance of ""More"" really shows off her skills as a Dancer and shows that she's a Triple Threat!!! George Hearn does great as always! And Last But not least Carol Burnett!!! Carol really puts some humor in the show. She's amazing in ""(Not) Getting Married Today"" which is a very hard song. Overall a great musical review!!!",1260835200,,1343,4.504098360655738

1669731,4,B00005UWBH,"I know what you might be thinking: ""ANOTHER Sondheim revue/concert/performance?"" There are only so many ""fresh"" and ""new"" versions of ""Send in the Clowns"" and ""Being Alive"" a person can take, even if you have stars like Bernadette Peters singing them...

Don't write this production off though. First, it does have a skeleton of a plot (although Pinchot himself admits in the opening number that ""there's not an awful lot"") which gives some structure to the show and lends to the emotion of several pieces. Carol Burnett and George Hearn play the rich, older couple and Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman play the younger couple, with Bronson Pinchot acting as narrator/butler/any additional character who is needed. The plot involves the older couple finding themselves falling out of love with each other and the younger couple in the midst of falling in love with each other. All perform admirably, although for me Carol Burnett was the standout. Her performance is alternately devestating, cuttingly sarcastic, and hilariously hysterical.

Thankfully, the production also avoids trying to include all of Sondheim's ""hits."" Although you will find a version of ""Being Alive"" (as a quintet!) and ""Getting Married Today"" (done only as Carol Burnett can do it), you will also find several of Sondheim's more obscure songs (at least for me). Songs such as ""Bang!"" and ""Unworthy of Your Love"" are perhaps less well-known, but brilliant all the same, especially as performed by Ruthie Henshall and John Barrowman. It was also interesting for me to see how each one of Sondheim's songs is taken out of the context of its original show and worked into a brand new setting. A song like ""Hello Little Girl"" takes on an entirely different meaning when sung by an old man as opposed to an actual wolf...

Overall, the show was just the thing after huge megahits like Wicked,  Spring Awakening, Jersey Boys, Legally Blonde, and in the Heights. An intimate night at the theatre, albeit viewed in your own home. You might not experience an exhilirating high after watching the show, but you'll leave with a renewed appreciation for Sondheim, his masterpieces, the theatre, and, ultimately, the different aspects of love.",1234742400,7,2207,5.071625344352617
