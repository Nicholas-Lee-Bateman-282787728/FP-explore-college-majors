209037,4,6300147630,"Back in the good old days of Beta-Max, I used to own this video and watch it on a fairly regular basis. Now I own a VHS (and my Beta has died), and I lost Scanners.
Last year, I managed to get a copy of it, and sat back to  watch it again. I was genuinely surprised - not because I'd forgotten what  happens, but because it has aged. This is not to say it is any worse - it's  still all the film it used to be...but you'll see the early eighties  written all over this film, down to the clothes and the special  effects.
Okay...I'm putting people off now. It's not bad! The film still  has a first rate plot. The acting is still impeccable. I'm still confused  as to exactly what the end means, but there you go.
Buy this film and  watch it. You will enjoy, and you may agree with me. hopefully, some up and  coming director will get a copy, and decide that this is a movie that can  be remade for now. Hopefully, he'll actually speak to Cronenberg and get  his input. When he does, I'll be first in the queue at the cinema.",926467200,,1024,4.044776119402985

209059,4,6300147630,"Scanners has become one of my favorites in recent years. There's probably not much I can say that's not been said about it already. For me, it's a classic sci-fi/horror film. Perhaps some of its reputation comes from the special effects, but the film is more than just that. The story is interesting and well written. Not to mention, Michael Ironside as the evil Revok, puts on a great performance. If there is something negative about this film, I would say that some of the other acting is a bit forgettable, especially the character of Cameron (played by Stephen Lack). I felt his performance was pretty flat, almost robotic at times. I'm not sure if that was the way the character was written, but at times, it just came off as poor acting to me. Yes, the special effects are great, and they still hold up today. The exploding head scene as well as the climatic ending are definitely highlights of the movie. But Scanners wouldn't be so beloved if it was simply just a special effects film. And though I wouldn't consider it pure horror, it's definitely a must own for any fan of the genre.",1499212800,,1094,4.558375634517766

Well, its never dull but it does suffer from the limited acting skills of the lead character (artist Stephen Lack as Cameron Vale) and his sidekick (Cover-Girl model Jennifer ONeill as Kim Obrist).  Most of the heavy lifting is done by Patrick McGoohan and Michael Ironside.  There isn't as much scanner destruction as one would want (the iconic head scene is wasted early on).  More thriller than a sci-fi flick, its an interesting concept that begs for a remake but apparently Cronenberg won't allow it.",1485216000,,646,5.242718446601942

Michael Ironside is great as the crazy bad guy and the effects are vintage and still hold up today proving that practical effects remain superior to CGI over the long haul.

209118,5,6300147630,"Anyone watching the recent feature High Rise would note the similarity of this work and early Cronenberg output: Shivers was a low budget influential Sci fi thriller depicting the spread of a germ through an ultra modern city based apartment block, with unusual sexual behaviours noting the onset of symptoms. High Rise duly picked up the mantle with a piece finding the central protagonist indulging in similar within the soundtrack of ABBA covers.
Scanners has explosive and memorable scenes front and back with a gory mission to show the power of being able to force anatomical and psychological change through force of will. This is less a film about the power of external atmospherics but of the mind, albeit within the context of super human capability.
Two brothers with equal powers represent the forces of good and evil in the harnessing and use of the powers and the film really is classic biblical fare with the story pitching one against the other with us watching to see who wins over the other. It is a timeless classic - much copied and derived from but never equalled. It was born from the Video Recordings era where the kids of the time would use the viewing of this film as a badge of honour, due mostly to the anatomical gore contained as bookends - much later surpassed for sheer in your face realism by the Hostel and Saw franchises, but without the conceptual strength of this masterful forerunner. Michael Ironside went onto be a staple cult film favourite, eventually succumbing to appearances in the likes of ER. Here though we see him as adults, watching someone who appeared 'really old and evil' sufficient to be of genuine threat and menace. One for the collective evening in with peers over food beer and wine.",1473465600,,1740,4.78405315614618

Classic groundbreaking sci-fi/horror from 1981. Those not familiar with the film can find reviews of the movie below. The HD transfer is very good & colors are vibrant and has plenty of depth. Grain is minimal (to be expected for a 35 year old low budget movie shot on film). Black & gray crush are very minimal. Best this movie has looked. It looks like it could have been shot yesterday. My only complaint is with the PCM soundtrack being in 2.0 simulated surround, which sounds adequate, but an HD transfer of the film should get a bang up Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack to go with the action in the film. I know the blu ray has the same PCM soundtrack. Looks like the director prefers the original mono soundtrack as with his other early films Shivers, The Brood, and Videodrome also from the Criterion Collection.

As with other Criterion releases this set has an excellent selection of special features including Cronenberg's first feature film ""Stereo"" (1969,62 min.) which shows Cronenberg's early obsession with telepathy and science fiction. Other special features include a booklet with an essay by critic Kim Newman, and a new documentary on the movie's special effects, an interview with Michael Ironside, and another with an interview with actor Stephen Lack, as well as an excerpt from 1981 of an interview with David Cronenberg on The Bob Mclean Show.",1450310400,2,755,5.291666666666667

209197,3,6300147630,"The movie itself I would give 3 1/2 or 4 stars. However, the picture quality on this Criterion version is average at best....and I can't believe I'm saying that about a Criterion release. I've been a huge fan since their laser disc days. Actually, I don't think it's really Criterion's fault; I suspect it's Cronenberg's. He personally supervised this new 2K scan and transfer. He turned the contrast way, way down and did something weird with the color timing. The picture now has a greenish tint. Swell, huh? As compared to a good HD transfer on blu-ray, the picture here looks muddy, washed out, and faded. It's almost as though Cronenberg (if he's the one responsible) was going for a VHS look. Check out blu-ray.com's screen caps and see for yourself.

Additionally, I would like to encourage anyone that already owns this version of the film to check out the supplemental feature, The Ephemerol Diaries. During this feature, several segments from the film are shown. Here, the film looks SPECTACULAR. The detail, contrast, and color is gorgeous. For some reason, Cronenberg's tweaking is absent. You only wish you could actually watch the film with this version of the transfer. After having poked around a bit online, I found out these clips are from the German blu-ray, from the distributor, Subkulture.

I have already ordered the UK Blu-ray, from distributor Second Sight. You can get it on amazon's UK site, and you don't have to get the fancier steelbook version, unless you want to. However, you'll need a region-free player.

I can only recommend the Criterion version over the previously released DVDs. All other blu-ray versions, in terms of picture quality, are far more to my taste. My strongest recommendation is to pick up a region-free player and get one of the blu imports. (You may be able to get a hardware modification for your current player that will make it region-free. Since it is hardware and not software, you can still install all of the manufacturer's firmware updates. I have an Oppo blu-ray and the mod for it is very easy to install: just plug into two places on the rear of the player. That's it.)

209231,4,6300147630,"In the telepathic/telekinetic sci-fi sub-genre Scanners stands out as one of the most thought provoking of them. Most people when they think of Scanner they think of that head exploding early in the film. However this movie is far from being a gory styled supernatural horror film. It's a film with a bit of complexity and is in a way thought provoking while at the same time playing on the dramatic sensibilities of the classic conspiracy theory. Scanners isn't a perfect film, but it is a fascinating one that touch on ideas way ahead of its time. If you are into movies about telepathic powers this should be top on your list.

Scanners are a small group of people (numbering in the hundreds worldwide) who have the power to read minds and essentially control the nervous system of their subjects. The corporation, ConSec, is developing scanners for corporate espionage, but a very powerful scanner named Revok (Michael Ironside) is bent on destroying ConSec's plans and any scanner working for them. ConSec's research head Dr. Paul Ruth uses this opportunity to recruit a powerful scanner (Steven Lack) to stop Revok. This being Cronenberg the film isn't so cut and dry, and there are plot twists along the way that make this simple ""stop that man"" scenario into something more complicated.

The powers of the mind have always brought out ideas of how that power can be tapped to do more. In the 70's extra-sensory perception (ESP) was becoming the rage; replacing psychics as the go-to side-show, so to speak. Science fiction movies started coming out in force over the subject at that time too. Scanners joins the fray after a dozen or so films have been release regarding people with mind powers of all shapes and sizes. Only up to this time most of these movies were focused on using telekinetic powers to essentially enact revenge fantasies. Scanners separated itself from the bunch by being one of the few (aside from The Fury) that makes the telepath a weaponized asset for a corporation, and opposing telepaths with an agenda that goes deeper than revenge. This is also the first film to actually explore the powers and abilities to the point of having an origin to the phenomena which paints an even more complex picture of not only conspiracy, but the implications of having a growing telepathic population. This stuff alone makes Scanners blow the competition out of the water.

The ideas that went into Scanners are still groundbreaking. The concept of how the telepathic powers work is a fresh one even today. The movie even taps into concepts that will only be approached years later by writers like William Gibson (I don't want to give it away, as it's a nice reveal when you find out on your own). If there is one thing this movie lacks in this department it's the lack of further development on the subject. The movie does touch on the theory behind telepathic powers much more than any movie before, and to this day is still uncommon among movies of this genre. So I have to give them credit where credit is due, but so much more could have been said and explored. If the film focused on that it would have been much better for it.

As it stands Scanners kind of mixes different themes, and in some ways this doesn't jibe too well. There are horror elements in the film, but hardly enough to call it that. You get the one iconic scene in the beginning of the film with a scanner's head exploding and couple other gory/scary parts, but that doesn't really qualify the movie as a horror flick. It almost feels like they were put in to get an R rating. I think this ultimately hurt the film as there were only two scenes that had any level of gruesomeness to them. Now this is a slippery slope of thinking since the gory scenes are the most iconic, but when you add the fact the best scenes weren't the violent ones it makes me wonder if the film would have been better received as a PG movie. Still more would have to be done. There are lots of Hollywood style that would need to be fixed. Stuff like cars exploding for no valid reason and other little details that seem to be there more for spectacle than moving the story forward. Also the movie is harshly dubbed, and I can't help but wish they had more time to refine the audio so it's not so obvious.

There are two notable Blu-Ray releases for this film. The Second Sight Films release from the UK and this Criterion Collection release. For me the best buy is the Criterion. Both have a great high definition transfer, but I feel this one is a truer representation with less cleanup of the film grain, and the colors aren't as artificially bright. I also prefer Criterion's 24bit mono audio track to the import's surround track since the original source material is mono, and Criterion's track is super clear. This collection also comes with a mini-booklet with a film essay and notes on the mastering done for this release. The extras are a good mix with some exclusives:

The Scanners Way - A Criterion exclusive, this is a pretty decent documentary that covers a wide range of topics on the making of the film. It has interviews from key production staff and runs at about 23 minutes.

Mental Saboteur - Interview with actor Michael Ironside that covers bits of his career, his work on Scanners and his experiences with working with Cronenberg. 20 minute running time.

The Ephemerol Diaries - Interview with actor Stephen Lack. Very similar to Ironside's interview in regards to what is discussed. 15 minute run time.

The Bob McLean Show -  A clip from talk show that aired March 10, 1981. It's an interview with director David Cronenberg where they talk about Scanners and other films Cronenberg has done. Kind of like the the movie plugs you see today on late night talk shows... only 80's style.

Stereo - Here is treat for you. It's a complete feature film Cronenberg did in 1969 that covers the same subject matter as Scanners. It;s only about an hour long, but this is a really cool extra to have. Where else do you get a bonus movie in high def as an added feature?

Trailer and radio spots - Interesting they add the radio adds. I haven't checked them out yet.

Scanners is a trailblazing supernatural/science fiction movie that, if it had more time to refine, would have been a serious contender as one of the best sci-fis of the era. As it stands it's still a very good movie that took on the subject matter in a whole new way. I consider this recommended viewing for fans of the genre. For the average viewer I think this film will make you think. You may have to forgive a few hiccups along the way and if you're squeamish may have to cover your eyes on the first scene, but I think the experience will be worth it.",1429056000,,6708,4.58465387823186

""I must remind you that the scanning experience is usually a painful one...sometimes resulting in nosebleeds, earaches, stomach cramps, nausea.  Sometimes other symptoms of a similar nature.""

The above comes from this absorbing sci-fi horror movie written and directed by David Cronenberg.

What is a scanner?  ""A freak of nature, born with a certain form of ESP.  A derangement of the synapses which we call telepathy.""

Cause: Unknown (but eventually revealed in this movie).

Number of Scanners on our planet according to this film: 237

This is a futuristic thriller, involving industrial espionage and intrigue, car chases, conspiracies, and shoot outs (including a grotesque scanner duel scene at the end).  It has good special effects.

This movie displays Cronenberg's trademark combination of the visceral and the cerebral.  As well, it is considered his breakout hit in the U.S.

I must warn you that the plot can be complex so it's imperative to watch closely.  Very generally, the plot involves Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), a renegade and tyrannical scanner, who is being hunted by another scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack).

This movie spawned sequels and spin-offs.  Cronenberg had no involvement with these possibly because they move away from philosophical angles explored by this film.

This movie's budget was three and a half million dollars and its box office earnings, so far, has been over fourteen million.

Finally, the DVD set itself (released in 2014) has 8 extras.  All of them are worthy of consideration.

In conclusion, I can't promise that this movie will blow you away but it might just cause your head to explode!!

(1981;  1 hr, 40 min excluding end credits;  2 discs, 12 scenes, wide screen, Criterion Collection, rated `R')

209363,5,6300147630,"I bought the Blu-ray; Cronenberg's ""Scanners"" has never looked better--although it still looks low-budget and seedy. But five stars anyway. Think about it: if a film has anti-technology themes and yet is technologically stunning, isn't it contradicting itself? And if, on the other hand, it stands its ground, it'll need to stand, somehow, at the low-tech end of moviemaking. So that's one thing, and here's another: this film has makeup by the great Dick Smith; music by Howard Shore; and, obviously, somebody out there created all those wonderful sculptures we see in the art gallery-scene and in the artist's studio-scene, so, obviously, a lot of attention was paid to certain details in this film, from which it must follow that if ""Scanners"" fails to look and to sound as you think a great movie ought to look and sound, then maybe ""Scanners"" wants to mess with your mind--and let's not forget that nothing about a motion picture is ever ""natural"": your expectations for the movies are mostly all just learned behaviors--or in other words, you're putty in a smart director's hands, aren't you? So try watching ""Scanners"" with all that in mind; and watch it more than once; and watch it back-to-back with Brian De Palma's ""The Fury"": let your daydreams build a playground on the common ground between the two films. In fact, one of the most remarkable thing about ""Scanners"" is that it and ""The Fury"" are two separate films. After all, both were made within just a few years, and both concern the same clash of values between, on the one hand, confused, fragile humanists with too much psychokinetic ability for their own good; and, on the other hand, self-righteous, power mad sociopaths willing to disappear anyone who gets in their way. Plus, ""The Fury"" ends with a body exploding through the power of the mind, leaving only a head falling back to earth; and ""Scanners"" had, as its original first scene, a man's head exploding through the power of the mind, leaving only the body. So, there's a bit of point-counterpoint going on, which we can take much further: pick at random a few major virtues of De Palma's ""The Fury""-- say, (1) an A-list cast delivering bright, charming performances, (2) smart and sharp cinematography, (3) beautiful sets, (4) a typically engaging John Williams score, and (5) a high-level, Pakula-like conspiracy at the root of the on-screen action. Well, sure enough, Cronenberg presents us with (1) a relatively unknown cast giving mostly wooden performances, (2) quite a bit of amateur-looking camera work, (3) decidedly ugly sets, (4) a musical score that Amazon reviewers disparage, and (5) at the heart of the action, a grass-roots conspiracy of apparent street punks hoping to take down corporations. So, all that's all flip for flop, isn't it? And it doesn't end there: the politics of ""The Fury"" are those of a James Bond flick (Kirk Douglas in the white hat; Cassavetes in black), while those of ""Scanners"" are a mess: the only heroes are a handful of doomed, pacifistic outcasts; and just who the ""bad guys"" are, and what they want, and why they want it, are beyond the viewer's grasp from first to last--and then, even beyond the last and into the credits, as the viewer beside you is heard to mumble, ""Uh..., what just happened?""

It must be true then, all things considered, that the wooden acting in ""Scanners"" is, for some reason, what the director wanted. Why? Well, wooden acting does keep the viewer slightly outside the drama. Maybe that means it can also help keep us thinking critically. ""Scanners"" compares well, in that respect, to ""Frenzy,"" another auteur work that deliberately exploits an unknown cast in order to keep the viewer from taking sides: with no Jimmy Stewarts on deck, we're on our own.

Take a look at the sets in ""Scanners"": the film opens in what seems to be an off-world location but turns out to be just a big, crass shopping mall. (The shopping mall in ""The Fury,"" by the way, is a thing of beauty: full of live trees and natural light) so Cronenberg begins by showing us the commercial realm as a place of artificiality, peopled by consumers who are equal parts smug satisfaction and final impotence. The story then moves to inhabit faceless, concrete, corporate strongholds--so power, in this movie, is definitely ugly; and, in contrast, the commune scene (think ""Easy Rider"" with ESP instead of LSD) is genuinely touching and terribly hopeful. In another key scene, the humanist school bus (yes, literally) crashes into a record store (and yes, there did used to be record stores on Planet Earth)--and what could be more appropriate? Granted, the war between Art and Technology is nearly imperceptible to us these days, since ""cold blooded Technology"" is winning it hands-down: we take for granted the green-screen scene and the tweaked, re-tuned audio--but let's for a moment recall that an Art-versus-Techno war was in fact fought across most of our lifetimes, and was fought, in particular, within the music industry and in moviemaking. So, there's something surpassingly poignant in the way that a crashed bus lies ajar amongst all those scattered vinyl disks--and video did, in fact, kill the radio star, which is also surely relevant: take, for instance, Jennifer O'Neill's role in ""Scanners"": why do we root for her? Just because she's pretty! And that, my friend, is a smart director proving in a snap just how easily he takes control of your mind.

And then there's this: ESP and psychokinesis are not in fact high-tech devices, are they? Nor are they in some way ""modern."" In fact, ESP and such are (would be) the lowest-tech possible form of what we now call ""energy"" because, if humans could perform incredible feats using only our collective minds, then we wouldn't need any wheels and levers, wouldn't need to buy apps and upgrades--heck, we wouldn't even need math. So, the common struggle of the ESP-freaks in ""Scanners"" and ""The Fury"" must be seen and understood as an anti-technology Declaration of Human Independence, represented on the silver screen, in both films, by compassion and a sense of community; and in ""Scanners"" also as a consciously Art-for-Art's-sake sensibility--e.g., ""My art keeps me sane."" The ESP freaks in both these films aren't ghosts in the machine: they're ghosts outside the machine; and their fundamental struggle is to remain outside--that is, to evade soul-crushing aspects of modern culture--and yet to remain, somehow, still alive. And that gestalt is fundamental to Cronenberg's oeuvre. Right? Of course.

None of this is meant to suggest that ""Scanners"" succeeds as a slick, mesmerizing, complacently satisfying, modern entertainment. The point is that mesmerization's dime-a-dozen, and how much more of it do you need? Why not watch something more quirky? Something that might make you wonder, worry, feel discomfort, maybe even doubt a few of your consumption assumptions--maybe even doubt ""human progress""--and all in the name of good, clean, vicariously dangerous fun.",1417910400,3,7004,5.004288164665523
209364,5,6300147630,"There's something about Cronenberg movies that has the unlikely actors playing the supposed 'good guys' that to me creates a disbelief at first, empathy, and nagging suspicion long after the movies over. And Scanners star Stephen Lack is the epitome of that. Whereas following Cronenberg films had 'big name' stars like James Woods and Jeremy Irons, etc. That seemed to instate the characters quirkiness a little more readily (""If it's James Woods doing it, it's gotta get going at some point..."") But I'd say Stephen Lack can hold his head up with the 'A List' just as well. At first, and to this day. the talk of this movie was of the gory 'exploding heads'. And when I first saw it, I thought it was so immature and lame. And I hate to say this about Dave's movies, but they're like hotel porn films on first viewing. One wants to FF to the 'money shots' and skip the cheesy dialog. And Cronenberg always seems to deliver some great 'money shots' vis a vis special effects in most of his movies. Exploding heads, lifelike TV sets, insect like typewriters that talk, etc. And at first, those are the memorable things when the movies done. But with Scanners, I wanted to go back and pay more attention as to what led to those gory effects. Even then, it's a bit daunting with Stephen Lacks 'friendly neighbor' persona. But there's this edge to him, an honest type of hidden tension. And it wasn't until I sat down with this DVD and watched with a 'clean slate' of expectations and judgement that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and say it is one of Cronenbergs classics.

209411,5,6300147630,"I cant get Scanners out of my head. It is absolutely chilling and its all about atmosphere. It is a film that is legitimately scary. It is a film that has truly given me the shakes. As my more morbid side digs through the conspiracy files and distorted histories of PSYOPS and MKULTRA, I do indeed find that David Cronenbergs 1981 spectacle has struck a chord somewhere in me. Cronenbergs vision is a sterile one. It is hard not to think of Cronenberg as a surgeon. His films nurture extremely cold and scientific manifestations. His films are mostly horrifying and uninviting. Yet his films are puzzling on account of their strange charisma. Behind the camera, Cronenberg adopts the aseptic mentality sought after by no one. His vision is oblique. Each film is like an autopsy video. Cronenbergs films seek to identify an illness, assimilate the symptoms, perpetuate the anomaly, and ultimately deconstruct its physical anatomy. Simply put, Cronenberg has the horror genre down to a science.

Atmospherically speaking, Scanners is possibly Cronenbergs most disturbing work. I found it to be nightmare inducing. It was clinical and detached, bizarrely neutral, shut off and mesmeric. This is a film that will haunt you without permission. It is psychologically stirring. It is a film with an illness, it is sickly. It is contagious and cerebral.

In Scanners, Freudian symbolism abounds, yet the true subtext is found in archetypical dimensions. Cronenbergs films have all been overtly Freudian in thought and Scanners is unique in inhabiting an unusually Jungian dichotomy. Jung believed that archetypes were psychic elements of the collective unconscious, motifs that can eventually manifest themselves in actual physical behavior. Scanners employs Jungs theory by way of instinct through symbolism. Great transitions and revelations are being made throughout Cronenbergs film and the characters involved assume symbolic archetypical characteristics to represent them. The most fascinating use of the archetype is what I believe to be at the true heart of Scanners. It is the archetype disguised as parable. It is the amalgamation. It is the tale of the two brothers.

In Scanners, we are presented with two undisputed absolutes. We are given a definite villain and a definite hero. According to Cronenbergs use of Jungian thought, we are actually given an undisputed transfiguration. This is a spiritual and mental change that is happening throughout the film, not just during the final showdown sequence. I actually believe that you can watch the films two brothers as if they were always combined, that their narratives are interchangeable or that they are at least operating in union with each other. Scanners is a film about becoming one with your psyche. Utilizing Jungian duality of man, wielding it as an archetype of transfiguration. A psychological complex enters the realm of the parable. The two brothers share one soul, the physical apparatus is but a container, or a hollow box. What Freudian thought encourages us to think of in this instance is that of a womb. The hollow box of the body, the archetype of opposing dualities or possibly even the restraint of both psyches, is in symbolic actuality a womb. These men are in the process of being born. The drug Ephemeral which created them and gave them their powers can also be used to repress them. A drug that is administered intravenously, the needle is a phallic symbol that operates in direct opposition to the hollow box of the body. It is an oppressive symbol. Dr. Ruth and his phallic instrument represent their God. Dr. Ruth as the supreme creator. He tampers with the boys psyches and restricts the very power his deliberate injections have fostered. The phallic symbol of Ephemeral and the feminine symbol of the body coalesce into scanners. Into archetypes. These scanners are warring with their feminine and masculine psyches. The two brothers are aware of this rift and amplify the archetype. It is a mental birth, a marriage between two warring factions: that of the body and that of the mind. The mother and the father. The brother and the brother, as one and at peace. Freud would interpret their transfiguration as a distorted form of wish fulfillment. Jung would simply see it as fulfillment. A subconscious takeover of the telepathic enigma. Scanners works as a Freudian interpretation of an intrinsically Jungian concept.

Scanners in manifest is also a daring and provocative showcase of special effects. A group led by the legendary make-up artist Dick Smith does not disappoint. Scanners is home to at least two are the most remarkable and notorious horror effects sequences of all time.  Scanners is both a technical and artistic triumph. It is even commercially viable thanks to narrative tricks of the trade. As a science fiction film, it follows the code of subtext and contemporary allegory as well as sensationalist exhibition. Cronenberg had learned well from both the literature and the monster films he had indoctrinated himself with at an early age and uses the narrative tools of the trade as only a master could. The body horror film has been fully realized.

It would also be impossible to write about Scanners without writing about Michael Ironside. His performance as Darryl Revok is one of the most significant of the whole science fiction genre. An understated and too-often overlooked character actor, Ironsides legend is eternal thanks to his work in Scanners. A riveting and entertaining tour de force. I wholly believe Ironsides Revok to be the stuff of genre picture magic.

The science fiction sub-genre of telepathy or mental horror is a category that deserves great distinction. I wish that more classics existed within its parameters. The mental horror sub-genre can assume many different tones and pursue unlimited psychological symbolism. More filmmakers should take advantage of this rough terrain. Cronenbergs film is smooth as silk and justifies the sub-genre in every possible way. Scanners elevates it and Scanners takes to the heavens.

This is one of the scariest films you will ever encounter on account of how psychologically jarring it can be. It is one of my favorite films ever made and one of the most deceivingly profound horror films ever imagined. A perfect early masterpiece from a man who would one day become the king of the genre. Scanners is proof of genre transfiguration. It is extraordinary.",1411689600,,6434,5.120952380952381

I have had other Criterion Collection releases before & have always enjoyed how great they gave treatment to films on DVD & now Blu-Ray.  And Scanners is no different.  3 discs.  One being Blu-Ray & the Other 2 being DVDs.  Packed full of extras (Including Cronenberg's first feature film).  This was well worth the $33 plus tax I paid for this!!!  The picture quality, was of course, excellent.  And was presented in widescreen format.
  Cronenberg is the master of the ""Body Morphing"" subgenre of horror.  This can be seen in his films VideoDrome, The Brood, & his re-make of The Fly.  But with Scanners he went more cerebral & far less ""Body Morphing"".  It seems to rely on sources stemming from the Us Government's usage of ""psychics"" & when drug companies have very bad results.  One doesn't see any real ""Body Morphing""  until the final climatic scene in the movie when the 2 antagonists ""Switch Bodies"".  Or I should say when one switches from his dying body to his enemy's body.
  The movie is slow paced and takes time to build to its climax.  Scanners was, and is, well known for having the very graphic ""Exploding Head"" scene.  Which is a great eye catcher.  But one should watch this movie for its complex subtlty & storyline.  It remains a personal favorite.

  The Criterion Collection Blu-Ray/DVD Edition is EXCELLENT!!!!!  Very well done.  The Picture is EXCELLENT.  Presented in Widescreen format.  But the other GREAT item is the extras are on a seperate DVD (Not Blu-Ray.  But then again the extras don't really need it.  Criterion Collection made interviews specifically for this edition made this year.  And they are GREAT!!!!!!  And I have gone through most of them.  I look forward to future editions of other films if they keep this up",1405555200,10,2133,5.158357771260997
209558,5,6300147630,"Scanners (1981) 2014 Criterion release.

I just received my newly released Criterion version of Cronenbergs Scanners... film has never looked better.

Scanners seems to drive a wedge between Cronenberg loyal fans... some thinking it is the worst Cronenberg movie made, others Reveling in it's ""Good versus Evil"" over tones in an age where movies like the Omen and the Exorcist ruled the roost.

This release is good looking give it's originals and budget restraints and unfortunately only comes with a mono uncompressed audio and sound track.

A horror movie only in the most simplistic terms, Cronenberg seems to have purposely chosen a Jewish looking man to play the lead Good Character, albeit naive, Cameron Vale... and an Arian looking man to play the lead conniving Bad Character, Darryl Revoc. He tells a story of a naive Scanner that is lead from afar into a world of good versus evil by Patrick McGoohan who is no less aptly named Dr. Paul Ruth... as in Ruth from the ""book of Ruth"" where Ruth accepts God of the Israelites as her God and the Israelite people as her own. Ruth states... ""Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried""... and so it is with Dr. Paul Ruth as he seeks to save and care for (as a father would save and care for his children), as many Scanners as he capable of saving.

As with the book of ruth... Dr. Ruth seeks inclusion and stress's the need for acceptance of outsiders and foreigners in an otherwise closed off secular world of the lonely Scanner.

Ultimately, good must do battle with evil and as such the movie points out the duality of man... the polar opposites ingrained in much of humanity to do either good or to do evil.

In the end, both good and evil must learn to live inside a single body with one being the dominate personality over the other and keeping that personality under control.",1405468800,,1954,4.518413597733711
209559,5,6300147630,This film terrified me like no other when I first saw it - on channel 9 years ago.

209561,1,6300147630,"I'm not sure if it was the wooden acting or the pedantic dialogue -- contrived purely, strophe/antestrophe style, for plot exposition -- that killed this film for me. I felt I was being dragged through a film that would have been better-rendered as a novel.  But even in a novel, the character relationships wouldn't have worked. Suffice it to say that in my view, if characters and concepts aren't introduced in action, they don't exist. Hemingway used to say that if you used an adjective, you didn't use the right noun. Well, if you have to have explicit exposition using tedious dialogue between two flat characters in a tableau, you haven't selected the right actions to film. The film started with a fine sequence, in which the most critical knowledge about the characters was conveyed wordlessly. Unfortunately, the characters then opened their mouths, and ceased to be real people; they became simply bloodless instruments to explain the plot, revealing Mr. Cronenberg's utter contempt for his audience.  It seems as if he forgot that just because people can't scan, it doesn't mean they can't make inferences. The film culminates in a Scooby-Doo style BIG REVEAL scene, containing perhaps half the script, but none of the justification for the revealed secrets. It's hard to suspend disbelief for long enough to reach that point -- I mean, couldn't they have just scanned each other's minds for all this expository information??? -- and impossible to do anything once the BIG REVEAL scene begins except distractedly read the DVD's packaging material, looking for the run time to see how long the antagonist's explanation will last. The film's tiresome devices made me long for the comparatively engrossing characters and carefree plot of, say, a film based on an Ayn Rand novel.",1400457600,3,1787,5.054237288135593

The script is rather impressive and feels like a chilled out Dean Koontz novel and Cronenbergs knack for gore and visual allure is all over this piece.  The makeup department had a field day with this one (1981 was the year for this kind of elongated facial deconstruction sequences) and the audience can have one too.  The films premise (which features men who can read minds and control actions hunting each other down in a secret society to take over the world) is filled with twists and turns and a conclusion that was worth every second of screen time.

209636,1,6300147630,"Having never seen Scanners, despite many movie magazines hyping it during my youth, and several home video incarnations coming and going over years, I naively assumed that it would be as good as hype led me to believe. It's not. It's a ramshackle, barely coherent bore populated by the most unattractive cast of characters, gruesome early 80s fashions, a dull, depressing production design, sound effects that are about 1 second out of sync, laughable technology, a musical score that sounds like a cat fitting on a broken synthesizer and some of the worst acting I have ever seen.

The confusing story has a drifter played by Stephen Lack (who's surname surely refers to his acting ability) taken in by Doctor Ruth (no, not that one - an old man played by Longshanks himself) of the ConSec company and informed that he is in fact a scanner - a person capable of ESP and telepathic abilities (or ""Tellow-pathic"" as one of the company elders proclaims). Apparently there is another scanner out there (played by low-rent Jack Nicholson Michael Ironside) who is recruiting like-minded people (pun intended) to his evil scheme. Anyone who resists gets their head blown up with his powers.

The potential in Scanners is immense. This is a universe that could go literally anywhere and do anything with it. But I am led to believe that the sequels are very poor (even worse than this?) and the two spin-offs beyond that are apparently even worse. I never thought I say this, but a remake of this movie would be welcome. A 2-hour remake or even a Scanners TV show would make magic of the premise, but it's squandered on a low-budget piece of crap movie like this. I do understand that Cronenberg was under pressure to get the film in the can very quickly, and some of signature style is barely detectable within, however no mitigating circumstances can make me see past the multiple problems.

Scanners was shot on 35mm by cinematographer Mark Irwin who went on to shoot RoboCop 2, Passenger 57, and Scream, but the highly-polished shine of those movies is nowhere to be seen here. Scanners has a couple of nice, bright shots and locations though it's mainly a grubby, unpleasant sight. The 1.78:1 1080p transfer is about as good as the film will ever look. The grain structure is very good, with virtually no noise reduction. The sound is in DTS HD-MA 5.0, but there's very little in the amateur sound design to get excited about. About 90% of the dialogue is poorly ADR-ed too. There are a nice amount of extras but I am not interested. The steelbook quality is exceptionally poor with no inside artwork, and the disc itself reads as BDMV when loaded into your player instead of having a label and thumbnail avatar.",1383868800,6,2710,4.737288135593221

Morse has plans to use a new mind-controlling drug on the telepaths, but has not reckoned with a rogue scanner who is determined to stop them.

209718,5,6300147630,"scanners is one of my favourite David cronenberg films, i still love watching the film today
i already have the Second sight films blu-ray version from last year which i think is the best version yet
when i found out that Criterion were also going to release this film on blu-ray i knew i had to buy it
just to check out the picture quality and the new special features
so i bought it this week off amazon.com and i've just finished watching it the blu-ray version not the 2 DVD'S
that come in the package i think that's ridiculous to add 2 dvd's discs with the blu-ray Disc.

here's my Comparison review
The Criterion collection vs the Second sight films U.K. blu-ray version
the picture quality for criterion version is suppose to have 2k Digital transfer
well i found the Criterion picture quality very similar to the Second sight films version actually
the picture quality for the criterion & Second sight films are both excellent quality, very clean and crisp
as far as i'm concerned they both have the same aspect ratio aswell

except for the Audio quality
there is only one Audio track for the Criterion version a Master Audio mono soundtrack
there is no new 5.1 surround sound mix on the criterion version which i think is Disgusting
the HD transfer maybe excellent but there is only a Master audio mono soundtrack
which is poor sound quality in my opinion, 5.1 surround sound mix is much better
now the Second sight films U.K. blu-ray
has both Master audio mono track and Master Audio 5.1 surround sound mix
so scanners fans can choose which Audio track they want
but tragically the Criterion release only has Master audio mono track, very pathetic.

The special features are the Highlight with both blu-ray versions i think
the first U.S. dvd release by MGM had no extras anyway,
the first U.K. dvd release by Anchor bay had a Documentary on David cronenberg
and a small 10mins interview with film critic

Criterion collection made the effort for scanners fans for sure on this U.S. blu-ray release
there is a new 22 mins Featurette on the special effects on scanners
explaining the Head exploding scene and the last scan scene between Michael ironside & Stephen lack
there's interviews with Chris Walas, Cinematographer Mark Irwin
Rick baker,Stephen Dupuis and other special effects make up assistants that worked on scanners
there's also a new interview with Michael ironside about his experience on scanners goes for 20mins
and a interview with Actor stephen Lack
There's also a 1981 interview with cronenberg on the Bob Mclean show
David cronenberg was the supervisor for the new HD transfer of the film
but was not interviewed for this blu-ray release for some reason.

Now Second sight films from the U.K. have done a very similar thing with their blu-ray version
there's all new interviews with Mark Irwin and
 a first time interview with Producer Pierre David who talks about the production for scanners
talks about actress Jennifer o'neil very interesting interview
Interview with Stephen lack goes for 30mins
Interview with make up effects assistant Stephen Dupuis
and interview with Actor Lawrence Dane, 5mins

i thought out of all the scanners dvd's releases  with MGM, Anchor bay which are pathetic releases
this Second sight films blu-ray of scanners is the best version to get for any scanners fan
excellent HD transfer and a new 5.1 Master audio track and all new interviews definitely worth the money
you can still buy it from amazon uk for sure
but now Criterion collection has now released their blu-ray of scanners
with all new interviews with the special effects make up team, Michael ironside & stephen lack

the packaging for criterion version is pathetic, it's 3 Discs, 2 Discs and blu-ray Disc in fold out Digpak
i prefer a clamshell keepcase with 3 Discs inside
the U.K. blu-ray is just clamshell keepcase which i think is better
i have both this U.S. criterion release and the U.K. second sight films release blu-ray's
i think they're both worth 5 stars for sure No doubt it
for any scanners fans out there, your decision either get this new criterion release
or the second sight films U.K. release which you need a region free player for for region B U.K.

definitely worth the cash to buy both.",1371600000,2,4233,4.794238683127572

The movie is about a group of people that have the power to kill and read others minds yet they have been oppressed by the normals till one day an evil scanner named Darryl Revok (played by Michael Ironside)decides that they should take over the ""norms"" by using an army of scanners, but CONSEC (evil inc.) decides that they don't won't to be overrun by scanners so they get a scanner named Cameron Vale (played by Stephen Lack) to fight Revok.

  Okay so on to another big point in the movie was the special effects. The special effects for this film are good for a low budget film, from the head explosions to the vains poping out, all making a lovely splatter house of gore and guts.

  Now finally we get to the bad parts. This movie suffers two problems, 1. the actting, 2. the emptiness of the film. Now the actting was good at times (mostly from Ironside) but Stephen ""lacks"" (huh, I made a funny joke.....laugh damnit) all emotion, I mean half of the time he stares blakly at screen as though he is waiting for someone to say his line and the other half of the time (when he actally speaks) he sounds like a robot.

  When I mean emptiness I mean that half way through the film, it was just filled with filler to the point were it felt like he made this up as he went along, like some how the middle of the original script was burnt or somthing and Mr. Cronenberg did not want to wright it again.

  This was a good movie with a good story and good special effects but was executed poorly and fell in the middle but shambled back up at the end. This is no where near a great horror movie nor will it ever be but it is a good movie and has been forgoten now a days, which is sad. All in all good movie, I give it a 4 outa 5.

This fairly early work is pretty rough at the edges, includes some outrageous gurning, some somewhat schlocky acting, and some unintentional laughs. Despite this, however, SCANNERS is a powerful little movie. Cronenberg's fascination with the visceral is present here, along with his interest in how the human mind and body might be transformed. These themes will be developed further, and to greater effect, in later films, but here they fail to sufficiently invigorate an otherwise lacklustre piece.

209789,5,6300147630,"SCANNERS is another excellent entry in David Cronenberg's long line of body horror themed films, this time centering on a telepathic spy (referred to as a scanner) that has been recruited by a secretive pharmaceuticals corporation in order to infiltrate and destroy a terrorist group of like-powered telepaths. Ironically, though there is very little gore, the film is best known for the blood splattered results of its few scanner battles. Rather than introducing computer imaging or visual FX for these sequences, Cronenberg uses a brilliant combination of drilling sound effects and bursting arteries to convey the sheer mental strength of his characters in the minds of his audience. This effect couldn't have been achieved without the slow and methodical scripting used to reinforce the raw power and fear generated by the characters' mutant anomalies. Overall, the film is very good, but there are two things that cripple it more than anything else. Stephen Lack's performance is dry and unnatural, making it difficult to identify with him as the lead. As with most other Cronenberg conceptions, SCANNERS is also a very cerebral film that focuses intently on its strong social commentary, which can make the plotting difficult to follow on the initial watch through and slows the pace down dramatically. Though the theme bears a striking resemblance to FIRESTARTER, this is likely just a coincidence as the two films are dissimilar in many ways. These two minor grievances are vastly outweighed by its sharp scripting and clear direction, and Cronenberg strikes another major success here. His obvious statements against designer drugs and man manipulating nature are much easier to decipher than in many of his other films. Michael Ironside also provides one of his strongest roles as the vengeful Darryl Revok, which remains to be his most memorable performance for many fans. While it isn't Cronenberg's strongest work, it is certainly one of his most recognizable, and it goes without saying that this is essential Horror viewing for all fans.

209790,4,6300147630,"A small number of humans have been endowed with superhuman telepathic power and are, amongst other things, able to read ordinary human minds.  For most of these people, they have been driven to depression and insanity.  Thus starts the story for the main character, Cameron Vale, of this early 80s horror flick.  Cameron is rescued by Dr. Paul Ruth, who explains some of his unique powers to him.  Vale, and others like him, are called Scanners, and possess powers far beyond simple mind reading.  Ruth recruits Vale to help battle Darryl Revok, a powerful but insane Scanner who is trying to find and either co-opt or destroy all other Scanners.  Ruth wants Vale to penetrate Revok's organization and ultimately destroy him.  Vale encounters other Scanners, battles some of Revok's minions, and learns that things are not quite what they seem . . .

This 80s era horror flick has actually aged pretty well.  It is most famous for the head blowing scene in which Revok kills another scanner by exploding his head using his telepathic powers.  There are plot holes that you can drive a truck through, and some of the acting is really poor (particularly by the two main characters - Stephen Lack and Jennifer O'Neil), but the story is sufficiently compelling (and gory) to hold one's interest.  Michael Ironside has some pretty crazy face gestures!  I certainly wouldn't put this film into the `classic' category, but it is fairly entertaining if you like horror films, particular from the 70s-80s.  If you haven't seen it before, you've got to watch it at least once, just for the head blowing scene and the climactic battle at the end - those two scene are all-time classics!",1249171200,,1675,4.8350877192982455
209791,4,6300147630,"A weapons company with a division focused on a new breed of telekinetic humans called ""scanners"" has run into trouble from the most powerful scanner yet, Darryl Revok, a psychopath with the power to literally blow your head off with his mind. The company swiftly recruits and trains a confused and naive scanner named Vale (Stephen Lack) to find Revok, but his deadly mission will lead him to new discoveries he never could have imagined.

From the renowned director of ""The Fly"", ""Videodrome"", and ""The Dead Zone"", David Cronenberg, comes one of his earlier Sci-Fi classics, ""Scanners"". This 1981 film has the dark, gritty look of movies like Highlander and Tron, setting a true '80's sci-fi mood. Ya gotta chuckle at the way they would cover the women in flicks from this period with so much bland clothing, right up to the chin, and still act like they were so very strikingly appealing, ha. Besides the excellent villain we get in Michael Ironside and Patrick McGoohan as the mysterious Dr. Ruth (not to be confused with that other Dr. Ruth), the characters in this sci-fi thriller could generally be more engaging and the second act can drag a bit if you are not so into the industrial espionage type stuff, but it is such an interesting concept they set up in the beginning and worth sticking around for the fun reveals and gross-out final battle! And, of course, the famous exploding head scene, earlier in the film than I expected, is really cool, and I'm not much of a gorehound, ha. The end did leave me a little uncertain, but not as much as all of ""Videodrome"". Though, I think that was the point of ""Videodrome"".

Scanners is presented on DVD in enhanced widescreen with one extra, the theatrical trailer. If you are a fan of Cronenberg's other works or sci-fi thrillers in general, this is required viewing. It's not fun not knowing what people are talking about when they talk about ""Scanners"", so give it one viewing at least!",1242345600,,1942,4.708823529411765
209792,4,6300147630,"Canadian filmmaker, David Cronenberg, films are generally quite entertaining. As in most of Cronenberg's films, his distinctive ""Body Horror"" style, will cause you to wince numerous times throughout the flick. Michael Ironside steals the show. This method actor is terrifying on screen, even in his very last scene at the end of the film.

If I could say something that may annoy many of you out there, the film does not carry over so well to today, given the dated musical score and the seemingly over used concept of ""telekinesis"" and the not-so-scary premise. However, put yourself in 1981 and this film was at the forefront of the Sci-Fi genre. A clear example of this is when Stephen Lack (who plays Cameron in the film), uses a pay-phone to ""go online"" by tapping into the line telekinetically. This scene obviously preceding The Matrix by almost twenty years. There are many a scenes like this.

Back to the music, Howard Shore's (who has since done the Lord of the Rings trilogy) score is fantastic and classic 1980's techno horror, but along with Bowie's album ""Low"" with Brian Eno (amongst a few other films and albums), this score basically set the stage for the wave of electronica music from the late-80's to today.

All in all, this film will be loved by those seeking a nostalgic feel for the 80's techno/Sci-Fi/horror feel in the light of Blade Runner.",1230768000,,1368,4.788135593220339
209793,3,6300147630,"In my own personal experience, Scanners was one of those movies that everybody around you had seen and told you how great it was but you still hadn't gotten around to it. I did finally get around to watching the film and I have to be honest, I expected a lot more from my experience. It was good don't get me wrong, but personally from my enjoyment of classic cheesy 80s horror-esque type movies, this didn't fit the bill. The acting was wooden and the story quite boring, sure it's a film about people who can read minds, but when you have your main character, a man who didn't originally know he was a Scanner all of a sudden become the most powerful Scanner, I felt the whole thing was rushed.

The tag line for this movie was ""There are 4 billion people on earth. 237 are Scanners. They have the most terrifying powers ever created... and they are winning."" Sounds like a good premise for a movie no? It's a great idea that could have made a great movie and although Scanners had its moments I just found the whole thing boring. The main character Cameron Vale played by Stephen Lack wasn't as interesting as I think Cronenberg expected him to be. He had the creepy look about him and he could pull the serious Scanner face as if he was constipated and trying to push one out, but that was about the only thing he had going for him.

The bloody bits were quite cool and very graphic as they were in those days. The infamous head exploding scene in particular grabbed my attention and disturbed me a little. Michael Ironside who plays the apparently very evil underground Scanner lord Darryl Revok is one of the best parts of the film and comes across as quite intimidating at times.

The story of the film is relatively simple, as the tag line implies there are 237 Scanners in the world and they're winning. Winning what exactly? well that's the war against normal humanity I think, let's be honest if they can read minds and we can't that makes them the enemy. Well a weaponry company known as ConSec and they manage to recruit and 'convert' a very powerful Scanner known as Cameron Vale. Dr. Paul Ruth head of ConSec's Scanner section trains Vale and sends him to find and stop Revok, with some surprising results.

OK, the movie is a bit more complicated than that but my point still stands about it not being as good and as special as people would have you believe. It's not the worst film I've ever seen and there are genuinely entertaining parts, however, there were points in which I found the film quite tedius and a bit predictable. I would recommend this as it's a worthy waste of your time, but I would say to not expect much.",1224979200,,2642,4.4300411522633745
209874,4,6300147630,"The seventies gave birth to psychokinetic horror films such as the blockbusters ""Carrie"" and ""The Fury.""  In 1980, David Cronenberg (director of such science fiction horror classics as ""The Brood,"" ""Rabid,"" and ""The Fly"") brought us ""Scanners.""

  Scanners are humans who can read your thoughts and manipulate your actions.  Most of them are emotionally dysfunctional because the multitude of thoughts that bombard them can produce insanity.  Therefore, they live in isolation.  The drug Ephemerol is used to block thoughts.

  Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) is a good scanner who must find and destroy an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside).  Revok is intent on creating a group of scanners that will rule the world.  This plot will be repeated numerous times in future sequels and in such horror hits as the ""Firestarter"" series.

  Cameron encounters many dangerous obstacles during his quest to locate his nemesis.  There is much death and bloodshed.  Beautiful Kim Obrist (Jennifer Oneill of Lucio Fulci's ""The Psychic"") is another scanner who befriends Cameron.  Together, they make an adorable couple and you can't help but cheer them on in their dangerous quest.

  Eerie music and wintry Canadian scenery provide an excellent background for this high tech chiller.  The acting is superb, the plot is fast paced, and the ending is quite shocking.  ""Scanners"" is a must see for fans of telekinetic horror.",1224115200,,1419,5.236607142857143

When there is a closeup of the cast speaking, their lips do not move with the words.  I was very disappointed in the quality of this dvd.  This movie is good and should have looked better on dvd.  Two stars was given because it is a good movie. I have this movie on vhs, and could have saved my money by not buying the bad dvd.  Save your money.",1221782400,7,510,3.950980392156863
209876,4,6300147630,"This 1981 film by David Cronenberg is absolutely mind blowing, you have to see it to know what I'm talking about.

This movie is about people with telekinetic powers that are viewed by society as ""freaks"" but a potential power source by one company, Consec.  These ""freaks"" are called scanners and have the ability to get into your mind and ""scan"" it. Scanners can use their ability for bad or good but sometimes have a hard time to control their ability. Dr. Ruth, a ""psycho-pharmacist"" who heads a research team for Consec (played by Patrick McGoohan)aids scanners with their abilities. Dr. Ruth tries to help one lone scanner Cameron Vale (artist Stephen Lack) to use his powers in a more positive way. Another scanner Darryl Revok uses his powers in evil ways and tries to convert Vale.  This is where the action begins.

This little gem is listed as a horror film, but I found it more sci-fi than anything else.  It may be dated with the clothing worn and is a low budget film, but do not let this stop you, for it is one good movie!  It is definitely one for lovers of sci-fi, thrillers or horror not to miss.

I bought this when Amazon had a terrific deal on DVDs and I sure got my money's worth!  Sometimes low budget films can pack a punch and this one does it, don't miss Scanners...",1217203200,,1293,4.4491525423728815
209877,5,6300147630,"One of David Cronenberg's finest mashes of science fiction and pure horror, Scanners remains one of his most frightening and original films to date.  Stephen Lack plays Cameron, a homeless vagrant who can hear other people's thoughts in his head.  Soon enough, he is captured by mad scientist Dr. Ruth (The Prisoner's Patrick McGoohan) and learns that he is a ""scanner"": a human with vast, telekinetic powers that are literally mind blowing.  When an even more powerful scanner (Michael Ironside) unhatches a plot for worldwide domination, Cameron goes hot on his trail, which leads to an inevitable, bloody showdown.  Though not all elements of Scanners have aged particularly well, the film still holds up nicely almost thirty years later, and the special effects do for the most part as well, with the infamous ""exploding head"" scene ranking among one of the best effects sequences of the era and genre.  Even though there were a whole series of vastly inferior sequels and spin-offs, David Cronenbergs' original Scanners is a masterpiece from one of the most brilliant minds to ever grace the science fiction and horror genres.",1203638400,3,1131,5.091891891891892
209878,2,6300147630,I saw this movie when I was much younger and loved it back then. Now that I am older and watching the movie I did not find it as good as I remembered. A few good scenes of exploding heads and melting faces but over all not very exciting.,1196208000,,237,3.857142857142857

I know it's meant to be on of those ""scary""/thinker/suspense movies but I ended up laughing through a good chunk of it.  The acting was terrible but the music was semi-decent.  I'll give it that much.  Of course, I'm not an expert on this genre but Scanners just didn't click with me.  The whole thing was just too predictible.  The ending just added to the predictibility.  If you want a classic stereotypical thinker movie, then feel free to watch it.  Worst comes to worst, you laugh instead of quaking in your boots.",1191801600,7,657,4.555555555555555
209881,4,6300147630,"Scanners is the story of a scanner (one who has telekinetic abilities such as blowing others' heads off) by the name of Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) whom doctor Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan) enlists to help him seek out an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants to lead his own army of psychotic scanners to world domination.

This was the film that put David Cronenberg on the map. It's one of his best and 25 years later, it still works; it actually fits this millennium like a glove, with all the experiments going on in science these days. As with all of Cronenberg's movies, he explores multiple themes and the film has more depth than it appears to have at first glance. It's a great blend of sci-fi and horror, at times unsettling, and features awesome special effects (the exploding head at the beginning, the final confrontation between Vale and Revok) and leads to a powerful climax. On the downside, the acting is a bit stiff and uninspired by the majority of the cast (save for Ironside who oozes evil in this role as in all his other roles).

If you're a fan of Cronenberg, what are you waiting for? You should have seen this already! If you like horror and/or sci-fi films, this one's a real treat. It's got a great plot, suspense, cool action scenes and Cronenberg's unique vision. See it today before the remake comes out next year!",1173830400,8,1364,4.632231404958677

It was still quite good though.  As great as Ironside did in being a villian, I think he could have easily played the hero in this as well.  His final scan with his brother in the movie was pretty intense.  Also, his first scan was pretty interesting.  His facial gestures were right on for what was going on as was the guy who, well, was supposed to be scanning Ironside.  Good suspense for a Sci-Fi flick.  The weak side of this movie was the hero, Stephen Lack.  His acting was a bit shaky.  I suggest this however.  I also bought Videodrome, which i haven't seen yet, but looking forward to it.

209883,5,6300147630,"I read somewhere that there is an estimated 12 to 15 per cent of the world's population that have been born with some sort of natural psychic--or ""psi""-- abilities. That's a whopping 720 million people at most. However the day to day abilities of  most of these people are pretty lame compared to the small number of people in this movie who are super-psychics who have gained  extraordinary telepathic and telekinetic abilities as the result of a birth defect due to a badly tested sleeping pill inadvertently given to pregnant mothers before they were born;

Daryl Revoc (played by a young Michael Ironside) tries to lead the scanners against the world, but finds opposition in a pair of scanners, one of which happens to be Revoc's brother. In some ways, Scanners is a bit of a cheesy sci-fi soap opera as Cronenberg unfortunately didn't have a big budget nor much time to write a better screenplay;  due to a quirk in the way Canadian films were made, Cronenberg had only two weeks for pre-production and to come up with a script. When Scanners went into production the script wasn't even finished; some may say that it shows, but I disagree. Despite some minor flaws, Scanners is a cult classic with some truly fascinating, and shocking, special effects that makes for a mind blowing ending. This is a great sci-fi film, but the DVD is somewhat lacking in ""special features.""

Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well.

Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all.",1164326400,3,965,4.848484848484849
209966,5,6300147630,"Scanners marks the emergence of David Cronenberg from low-budget horror auteur to one of the most unique voices in filmmaking of the last thirty or so years. He first came onto the scene directing such low-budget horror films such as Shivers, Rabid and The Brood. These three films were later said to have had that Cronenberg propensity to show the horror of the body-politic at its most basic. Cronenberg pretty much points out of how true horror might not be lurking on the outside, but within the the human body. Cronenberg makes the human body as forever changing and mutating against the individual person's wants and desire of what was suppose to be the ideal. The horror that we as a people do not and will never have control over our own body was where the true horror lie.

In 1981, Cronenberg moves from the purely physical horror to one where the technology man was forever trying to create and achieve perfection would turn on the biological aspect of the human condition. This new form of techno-organic mutation was as terrifying as it was seductive in its potential to those afflicted with it. Cronenberg begins this phase in his filmmaking voice with his excellent, underappreciated and cult-classic Scanners.

The premise for Scanners had alot in common with Stephen King's novel Firestarter in the fact that in dealt with an omnipresent and powerful organization: the CIA's shadowy branch that dealt with experimental weapons programs for Firestarter and the ultra-powerful CONSEC multinational corporation in Scanners. These two organizations experiment on random select individuals using experimental drug treatments under the guise of helpful medications. What results from these experiments are more than what was truly expected by their handlers. In Scanners the result comes from mental abilities never seen or documented in the past. CONSEC's experiments have yielded a unique group of individuals, 237 of them, to manifest powers of the mind that make them living weapons of mass destruction. Instead of becoming a new wonder-weapon for CONSEC to sell to their government contacts, these 237 become unstable in personality, some going as far as to develop a God-complex. Others are driven insane by these new abilities and retreat away from the rest of humanity in order to achieve a semblance of mental peace.

These two different reactions from the 237 are keenly represented by two of the main character's in Cronenberg's film. There's Cameron Vale (played by Stephen Lack who had an eerie resemblance to the same named character of Stephen in Dawn of the Dead) who we first see as a vagrant who seems to be suffering from some sort of mental problem. This is farther from the truth as Dr. Paul Ruth (father of the CONSEC drug effemerol that causes the mutation and played with eccentric flair by Patrick McGoohan) soon discover that Vale's mental problems is due to him possessing preternatural mental abilities of the highest order. Ruth's guilt over what his experiments have done and created leads him to use Vale to counter the growing underground of those 237 who have seen their newfound abilities as a stepping stone to supplanting the normal status quo with their own in a plan of global domination that would make fans of X-Men very proud.

Leader of this underground groups of scanners (as the 237 were called) is one Darryl Revok. A scanner whose abilities rival those of Vale's but whose mental instability for wanting to dominate the normals of the world makes him the most dangerous individual on the face of the planet. Genre veteran Michael Ironside steals the film from everyone else. His grand and classic introduction early in the film has gone down in filmmaking history as one of the most shocking scenes put on film. Ironside's performance as the scanner with the God-complex was truly megalomaniacal and it was easy to root against him, but hard to take one's eyes from the screen when he was on. Revok truly made for one of film history's classic villains.

In the middle of Vale and Revok's war for control lies Kim Obrist (played by the beautiful Jennifer O'Neill) who tries to lead those who just want to be left alone from being used by both Revok and CONSEC. O'Neill's performance was the most grounded in reality, as much as a film about people with mental powers could be, and tries to keep the film from getting too fantastic.

This I think was what made Scanners such a great film. As ludicrous a premise as the film had to base its sotry on, there was always a sense of realism to keep everything form becoming too much like a comic book. The story paints a story that could happen in reality since similar things have occurred in the past such as the LSD testing on US military personnel during the 50's and 60's. Cronenberg plays on such fears of outside factors introduced by scientists looking to forever improve on what nature took eons to evolve. It's this hubris about man's attempt to dominate his own body which interests Cronenberg and what would happen if he did succeed in doing something nature and humanity wasn't ready for.

Scanners marked Cronenberg's interest in examining the effect of man's quest for better and better technology, whether mechanical or biological, on humanity's physical and mental existence. What he brongs forth, first with Scanners then later on with Videodrome and The Fly, was something both horrific and seductive. Who wouldn't want to have such abilities as Vale and Revok had at their command. But by the end of Scanners the film posits the question of how much of one's humanity must be sacrificed for such huge leaps on the evolutionary ladder. Will the resulting amalgamation of nature and technology still leave something human or just something that pretends to look like one.

Some have called Scanners a horror movie and some have called it a sci-fi thriller. It's both those and more. It's really hard to pin down just exactly which genre Scanners falls under since Cronenberg never tried to stay within one particular one. The film works as a thriller, as a science-fiction story, a horror flick and a philosophical exercise in examining the human condition. Cronenberg's skill was clearly evident in keeping all these differing themes and genres from becoming out-of-place and bringing the finished product from becoming too flawed. Cronenberg's first foray into this new phase of his filmmaking career ushered in what some have called Cronenberg at his most daring and pure. I wouldn't argue with such an argument. Scanners is a film of great quality that would forever be used as an example of Cronenberg's genius as a filmmaker.",1154822400,22,6650,4.936550491510277
209967,5,6300147630,"A top secret government program is installed to develop the psychic powers of a certain breed of special individuals known in the underground as 'scanners', who can be used for espionage as well as super-human weapons; yet there is a rift even here between them. The most potent of these scanners named ""Darryl Revok' {Michael Ironside, here displayed with a scar on his forehead where his 'third eye' would be, self-inflicted in an attempt to keep 'the people' out, during his formative development} seeks world domination, and is fully aware of the artificially pharmaceutical origins of these elite mind gods. After forming his own organization, he searches decades for his long-lost younger brother Cameron Vale, whom Revok finally locates in the custody of a Dr. Paul Ruth {""father""}, after being discovered as a vagrant whose powers were spurious at best. With the help of Dr. Ruth, Vale begins developing his abilities to a razor's edge and soon comes into his own meeting with other scanners to find an understanding for his condition.

These scanners are stalked by Revok's goons who dispatch every one they see, so that Revok may finally build that society in which he is lord of all. Vale meets Kim Obrist {Jennifer O' Neill}, and they fall in love by mutual survival. He meets artist Trevellyan who deals with his scanners talents through his wonderfully dark art, but is assassinated - here, Vale defends himself in a most magnificent scene.

Revok and Cameron finally meet in a covert meeting arranged through subterfuge, and even though Revok reveals the truth of those who would keep he and his brother as veritable mind slaves, a psychic war ensues between them which ends in a very surprising manner.

Key scenes include Revok impressively dispatching a scanner at a paranormal convention, in which his victim's head literally explodes. Revok forcing a company enforcer to kill all his accomplices, then comitting suicide so Revok may continue his goal of world domination. And of course the concluding scene in which the two prime scanners battle with an optimum and extreme intensity so as to be awe-inspiring.

I Am reminded of certain independent as well as officially-funded programs underway experimenting with what is now referred to as 'remote viewing' {telepathy, telekinisis, & clairevoyance}, actually employed by governments for special military intelligence purposes, by which this film may have been inspired.

To those interested in developing these types of mental abilities {which are largely comprised of that occult 90% of the brain}, just keep practicing, and like exercising the body, there will be steady progress by visualization and sheer force of will, which will lead to greater and greater results.

Please Note: Because Amazon combines these reviews into a hodge podge mixing old, new, domestic and imports in many cases, I've revised this review to include both the Criterion new release (7/15/14) and the original MGM DVD. Unfortunately, Amazon still doesn't get (or care) that a re-release of a title isn't like a book where there's little variation beyond the cover and type face and there are sometimes massive differences between the original version and reissues.

Best remembered for the exploding heads seen in the film, ""Scanners"" is more than a shock horror film combining director David Cronenberg's interest in creepy conspiracies (indeed, the paranoid conspiracy of ""Scanners"" could have come from a Philip K. Dick novel)and much larger themes about humanity.

Criterion's blu-ray release more than one-up's the DVD from MGM; the film is the best it has ever looked with a sharper image due to the 2k restoration and transfer done by Criterion (supervised by Cronenberg himself).

What truly distinguishes this set aside from the transfer are the healthy amount of special features included. We get Cronenberg's film ""Stereo"" which is thematically related to ""Scanners"". We also get a new interview with actor Michael Ironside discussing the making of the film. ""The Ephemerol Diaries"" is a 2012 interview with lead actor Stephen Lack. Cronenberg himself appears in a 1981 interview excerpt from his appearance on the CBC's ""The Bob McLean Show"".

Rounding out the special features is a new documetnary on the making of the film ""Scanners Way"" documenting the visual effects for this groundbreaking film and the production issues Cronenberg faced.

We also get a booklet with an essay by author and film critic Kim Newman.

The set features both a 2 disc DVD (movie and special features)and a single Blu-ray (both).

My only complaint is with the packaging. Although handsomely designed, I'm not a fan of cardboard packaging that Criterion has lately gone to for many of their releases. The packaging is flimsy compared to a Blu-ray case and, although the case that holds the discs is protected in a cardboard slipcase, overall I believe these type of cases don't stand up to wear and tear as well as plastic ones AND if you need to replace the case due to damage, there's not much one can do. This is a minor complaint but I do wish that Criterion would listen to their many customers and go back to the plastic cases with a slip case.

MGM DVD ORIGINAL RELEASE REVIEW:

David Cronenberg's ""Scanners"" was the first film I saw by this imaginative director. Cronenberg's film may lack the big budget of a Hollywood production but what it lacks in money it makes up for in an imaginative well executed story. This tackles the same story (essentially although it should be noted that Cronenberg had the idea well before ""The Fury"" release)as Brian DePalma' ""The Fury"" and while it lacks true star presence in the lead role the supporting cast more than makes up for it. It's not a perfect film (some of the performances by the actors come across very flat)and it lacks the sure hand that guided ""The Fly"", ""Dead Ringers"" and ""Videodrome"" but the fire and intelligence is there.

Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack)believed to be schizoidphrenic because he constantly hears other voices in his head is recruited by Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan) to help track down a man named Darryl Revok(Michael Ironside. Revok like Vale is a scanner--someone who can read other people's other thoughts but it seems that a scanner like Revok can also be used as a weapon. Revok has other plans--he doesn't just want to be the weapon but use his skills to rule. Vale allies himself with Kim Obrist the only person he finds he can trust in this war between Ruth's company Consec and Revok.

Stephen Lack (as noted elsewhere)has a complete LACK of presence in the role. Luckily McGoohan and Ironside more than make up for his weak performance with strong, eccentric and memorable performances. O'Neill is only slightly better and appears to be in this film only so it could get U.S. distribution after the success of ""The Summer of '42"". Regardless of the film's deficits Cronenberg's thoughtful visual and gory film (hey a head explodes)demonstrates his flowering ability as a director.

The transfer looks pretty good in this transfer to DVD while there aren't any extras beyond the movie trailer, the film itself comes unedited. A commentary track from Cronenberg would have been nice but given that this was released in 2001 on DVD and this probably isn't a huge seller (more a cult film now)I'm not surprised that it comes so bare bones.

Like Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg institutionalizes the Cartesian, Consec housing the balance.

The final shootout sequence whereby Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) and Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) scan themselves to death happens to be the first film since Crimes of the Future to have a distinct notion of closure, the means to an end, culminating with an optimistic destruction of a character.

210046,4,6300147630,"From writer/director/auteur David Cronenberg comes another intelligent and visceral sci-fi/horror classic in the form of Scanners (1981), a film that takes a disturbing look at potential of the human mind within all of us, but only a few may actually possess.  The questions posed are what if there were those out there who had the ability to read minds and control people actions just by thought?  And what if those same individuals, scanners, as called within the film, also had not only the ability to read minds and control the actions of others with their mind, but also had the power to kill with the same means?  The film stars Jennifer O'Neill (Summer of '42), the eccentric Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner, Silver Streak), Michael Ironside (Total Recall), and Stephen Lack, who, by the way, is not only an actor, but also a world-renowned artist, having garnered much acclaim for his paintings.
As the film begins, we see a homeless man (Lack) wandering a mall, getting dirty looks from all the people he sees (hey hey we're the Monkees...whatever)...anywho, one woman in particular, in the food court, seems exceptionally offended by his presence, but she soon has other things to worry about as she suffers from some sort of brain freeze, like the kind you get when you drink something cold too fast, brought on by the homeless man...turns out our homeless man (in my day, they were called bums, but whatever), whose name is Cameron Vale, has psychic powers of some sort, and has garnered the attention of CONSEC (whose chairman looks a helleva lot like Ed Asner), a company that specializes in weapons, specifically Dr. Paul Ruth (McGoohan), who describes himself as a `psycho pharmacist', whatever that means (I bet he's a lot of fun to hang out with on the weekends).  Dr. Ruth basically recruits Vale in a effort to track a particularly dangerous and powerful scanner by the name Darryl Revok, who's supposedly head of an underground movement of scanners and who has also basically decimated CONSEC's program of exploring the weapons potential of scanners, as he seems to subscribe to a policy of if you have special mind powers, then you either join up with him or you get your head exploded.  Along the way Vale meets with Kim Obrist (O'Neill), a sort of leader of a fringe group of scanners outside of CONSEC and Revok's control (not for long), and they soon find themselves fighting for their lives as conspiracies unfold, traitorous scoundrels exposed, and secrets reveals.  What's Revok's ultimate goal?  It's not that far-fetched, considering his abilities...
I enjoyed this film...there really wasn't too many lengthy visceral scenes, but what there was contained very graphic gore (s'ploding heads) that imprinted on your mind, and tended to stay with you long after the scene was over.  One scene, in particular, when Revok deals with the scanner at CONSEC, the tension was thick as the pressure, on and off the screen, built up quickly, and resulted in the film's most spectacular and memorable sequence.  Jennifer O'Neill is good (and very easy on the eyes, shabba doo), but I didn't quite understand her character's connections to the other characters in the film, other than her being a scanner.  It almost seemed like a plot contrivance if only to incorporate an attractive female, not that I mind attractive females, but her scenes could have pretty much been removed without much loss to the plot.  Patrick McGoohan is one of my more favorite actors and he plays his part very well as the mentor/trainer to Lack's character, sort of a Professor X, if you are familiar with the X-Men comics or movies.  Lack provides a sort of disjointed performance, but I felt as if it was intentional, as it seemed to work really well within the movie and fit his character, one who's spent most of his life trying to deal with the problems associated with his special abilities.  I thought Michael Ironside's character was great, as he plays the role of the sadistic heavy with a God complex so very well (except, maybe for his role in Highlander II: The Quickening...ugh, what a complete dog that movie was...).  He reminds me a lot of Lance Henriksen, both good actors but rarely ever emerging from B-movie limbo.  Maybe they need better agents.  There was a certain amount of symbolism throughout the movie, the most noticeable being when Lack's character is following up on lead by contacting a reclusive scanner who is an artist living in a barn.  One of his pieces is a giant, hollow head, and there's a scene where the two men are actually sitting in the head, talking about Revok.  There seems to be some confusion about the ending, after the final confrontation, but I thought it was pretty clear, and provided a nice eerie touch.
MGM presents a nice wide screen anamorphic transfer, but some have commented on the certain parts of the film being out of sync, but I didn't notice.  I was a little surprised there was so little in the way of special features given the cult following of the film and that of Cronenberg in general, with only a theatrical trailer available, but I suppose someday they will produce a special edition of sorts.  I would have liked to have seen a director's commentary, or some production notes, but I am pleased with what's here.

210049,2,6300147630,"Along the trajectory of David Cronenberg's career, Scanners feels like a step backwards. While the premise is intriguing - drug companies and evil corporations wage bloody war with telepaths as cannon fodder - the execution is painfully dull and unintentionally funny. Part of the problem is the acting, which is wooden all around but reaches new depths whenever Stephen Lack opens his mouth. This guy is dreadful. He sure does Lack the ability to deliver lines. The high point of the film comes early with the infamous exploding head scene. Nothing that follows, not even the climactic psychic battle royale, comes close to the visceral potency of that scene. It's all downhill from there. For instance, how does a telephone booth explode? And if you were shot in the hand with a huge dart, wouldn't you just pull it out rather than run around a mall until it knocked you out? If there were a few more exploding heads I might not be splitting hairs. A disappointing outing from a talented filmmaker.",1074470400,4,1000,4.819767441860465
210050,4,6300147630,"By now you have all heard about the infamous exploding head scene. I actually never heard of this because all I was interested at the time was that it was a Cronenberg film and thought it would be worth a go. It was a great purchase!
The whole idea of the film is that there are scanners in this world who can read people's minds and if they don't like what they hear they kill them! I have a feeling some people would love that power. The scanners can be either "" self destructive or simply destructive."" I'll admit the acting here at times can be wooden but I think there's a need for Cronenberg to have his characters perform wooden acting. It enhances the view that these socially inept scanners are all dehumanized humans who don't know how to survive in this world.
By the way I must mention the soundtrack here. This has got to be the most insane thing I've ever heard. It's as out there as you can possibly get. I don't know how they managed to get it the way it is but I really like it. I only wish they released it on CD because I'd love to listen to this more and more
The ending must be intentionally meant to confuse people. I've seen this about 10 times or so and I still don't know what they meant by "" It's alright - we've won! "" Who's won - I don't understand. Am I missing a scene from the film? That could be true since the censors where I lived in Ireland are notoriously picky about some scenes and would edit them out. Then again I don't know if there was an uncut edition in the first place! Even still I'd probably still be left confused by it all

210051,5,6300147630,"Every once in awhile I like to dip my toe into a David Cronenberg film. I have seen quite a few of them at this point, from some of his earliest stuff like ""Rabid"" to his seminal reworking of ""The Fly"" starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get out of a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's viewpoint towards a synthesis of man and machine is always exceedingly grim, not to mention gory as all get out. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind never prevents them from charging into potentially damaging experiments. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. ""Scanners"" should fall into a ""Cronenberg 101"" class about these messages. Released in 1981, this film helped bring Cronenberg into the mainstream, as well as spawning a host of cheap sequels and a possible remake due sometime next year. Of course, this movie also provides the rabid horror fan with what is possibly the sickest gore scene in cinematic history.
""Scanners"" tells the story of Cameron Vale, a man who has spent most of his life in a perpetual fog. Roaming through the streets of the city as a homeless person, Vale suffers from a plethora of voices constantly yammering away in his head. He cannot hold a job or have a regular life with this problem, so he copes the best way he can by always staying on the run. During one of his excursions in a shopping mall, Vale overhears two women casting aspersions on his grubby appearance. The comments bother Cameron, who promptly causes one of the women to collapse into convulsions merely by mentally concentrating on her. Two thugs in trench coats lurking nearby notice Vale's little performance and promptly chase him down. When our hero wakes up, he is in the company of one Doctor Paul Ruth, a laconic chap who gives Vale the lowdown on what he is and what he must do. Ruth comes across as distant and slightly sadistic, but Cameron trusts him because the doctor knows how to make the voices in his head stop and is the first person to show a real interest in him.
According to Ruth, Cameron is a scanner, a person with the ability to use a congenital form of telekinesis to manipulate other human beings. Ruth shows Vale that an injection of a drug called ephemerol quiets the voices in his head, which are really the voices of people around him that he picks up because he doesn't know how to use his scanning abilities. What Cameron doesn't know is that Ruth works for CONSEC, one of those evil corporations most movies seem to have nowadays, a company developing scanners as a weapon for governments and wealthy individuals. Moreover, Ruth initially fails to tell Vale about the presence of Darryl Revok, a powerful scanner who is building an army of these telekinetics, or how Revok just invaded the CONSEC building and killed six men in an attempt to discover exactly what new tricks the corporation has up its sleeve. Ruth then enlists Cameron to track down Revok and kill him. Along the way, our scanner encounters the beautiful Kim Obrist, uncovers the truth behind ephemerol and how scanners came to exist, and the true identity of Darryl Revok.
Stephen Lack, the actor who plays Cameron Vale, carries out his onscreen duties with all the charisma of an ironing board. Some people claim that this is exactly the way a confused homeless man should act when confronted with such an awesome series of events, but I don't buy this argument. Lack gives a whole new meaning to the term ""wooden"" and the movie suffers because of it. Fortunately, Michael Ironsides as Revok, Jennifer O'Neill as Kim Obrist, and Patrick McGoohan as the strangely aloof Doctor Ruth make up for the lead character's ham handed performance. Of these three actors, Ironsides steals the show as the unbalanced Darryl Revok. Anyone remotely familiar with this actor's work knows he often plays the lead evil guy in dozens of films, and ""Scanners"" marks one of his best turns as a baddie. Without Ironsides in the cast, this movie would not be nearly half as good as it is.
The most memorable elements of ""Scanners"" are both good and bad. The good is the gore, which tops most horror films on the market. The infamous exploding head scene at the beginning of the movie still makes me cringe. In fact, it ranks as one of those rare scenes in a film that actually get worse the more times you see it. The first time you watch the movie, you have no idea that this scanner's head will burst like a balloon. Subsequent viewings are worse because you know what's coming and the anticipation fills you with dread. The final showdown between Vale and Revok revolts as well. What doesn't work in ""Scanners"" centers on the sudden ability of Cameron to scan a computer system through a public telephone. I simply didn't buy this suddenly revealed ability, let alone that it would lead to the telephone booth exploding. Unfortunately, another drawback is the lack of substantive extras on the DVD. The picture quality is good, but I would have liked a commentary by Cronenberg to explain the philosophy behind the picture.

That's not to say that Scanners wasn't enjoyable.  The special effects really are what make the movie; the exploding head in the beginning has since become one of horror's greatest movie moments-it's that priceless.  The acting, with the exception of Patrick McGoohan, is non-plussed and wooden, oftentimes just downright uninspired.  Steven Lack has to be one of the most ironic and appropriate names for an actor that ever existed.  At it's heart, Scanners is an action movie, there are plenty of scenes of tension that move the story forward; at no point will you feel very bogged down by exposition until you get to the ending, and then you will have whiplash from having had the whole story laid on you so fast.  Many Cronenberg elements can be seen in this film:  excessive violence, fatalistic outlooks from many of the characters, and Cronenberg's own patented pessimism, which seems to hover over every one of his films like a specter.

Scanners though, made Michael Ironside a stand out actor for me and Jennifer O'Neal I later saw in Cover Up on CBS with John Erik Hexum.  The concepts dealt with here were pretty advanced for me as a chidl when I saw them in the movies but I'd been reading comic books so it wasn't that hard to follow.  The head blowing up scene, is probably horror movie classic but what I liked most about this was the secrecy elements, te stealth, the slow unravelling of this whole mammoth conspiracy and it's reprecussions.  Also this film is fair to both sides of good and ""evil"" here as it gets into advanced species dominance theories.

But when I sat down to see it I could only see small pieces of greatness drowning in a sea of a greatly overrated film.
Sure Cronenberg is a talented director, and Scanners shows his promise, but this story about people with telekinetic powers seems like it comes from a rough draft of a script without the ideas, plot and characters fully worked out. Almost as bothersome is the monotone acting by the lead, a newly recruited scanner sent to kill another attempting to take over the world. Though many have said the acting is intentional, it just came across to me that he was a very poor actor (of course, the DVD's badly dubbed voices could account for some of that). But more so, every scene seems as though it's still a work in progress, that the screenwriter (Cronenberg) ran out of time before production. It doesn't feel remotely closed to polished.
I admit that if I had seen this in 1980 when it came out, that it may have had a bigger impact on me. But I've seen plenty of sci-fi prior to this time that was leagues better then Scanners. I know I'll catch some flak for my unpopular view, but it's my honest, well thought out opinion. Of course I thought the ""exploding head"" scene was excellent in its shocking quality, the rest of the film just seemed to fall from there.
Scanners was a major disappointment for me, and though I know many disagree with me, I can't share their enthusiasm. It's worth checking out if only too see the exploding head, but, for me, is otherwise a forgettable film.",1044921600,4,1670,4.496710526315789

Even if here, the treatment is more on the level: the good against the evil. Four years after Brian de Palma's ""Carrie"", dealing with telekinesis, Cronenberg introduces us to another paranormal phenomenon.
20 Seconds... YOU CAN'T BREATHE.
A 'Scanner' is a person with a particularity: a dysfunction of the synapses in his brain, also called 'telepathy', the ability to mentally penetrate anybody's mind, to possess it. Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) is one of them, one of the most powerful, and the most ambitious. In some distance, he's able to make anybody do anything, included kill himself. During a meeting he gives a demonstration of his power, blowing up the head of another Scanner, one of the most famous 'gore' scenes ever shown on a wide screen. His ambition is take his revenge on the normal people who isolated the whole community of telepaths, who put it in some kind of a ghetto, and dominate the world. Only one person can do something about it: a Scanner as powerful as he is, maybe more. Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack), a homeless, disturbed man, is the one, and Dr. Paul Russ (Patrick McGoohan) is, with Revok, the only one to know about it. After some time of effective investigation Vale manages to mentally penetrate and destroy the heart of a big computer which contains a very important program about a medicine, the Ephemerol, supposed to shut down the power of the Scanners but also to create other Scanners, through pregnant women. The psychological fight between Cameron and Darryl can begin, even when Darryl reveals Cameron that they're brothers, and that Dr. Paul Russ is their father, who gave some Ephemerol to his wife.

This astounding movie, now a classic masterpiece, was n 1 in America when it was released and it's not a surprise. If the story is not very innovative, we can't say the same about the way it's used and treated. To the usual fight between the good and the evil is added a reflection about genetical experiments from medicine men, and their eventual consequences in our societies. The script, well written and told, is very intelligent, the art direction and 'gore' special effects are perfect and the acting is solid. It's the first popular film Cronenberg has made, and along with his next release, ""Videodrome"", it's still one of his best and most original and curious. A rare piece of intelligent and efficient 'gore' cinema.",1034380800,,2801,4.9113924050632916

True at times it is a bit camp, and the dubbing of voices at times is bad, but the acting is timeless, the scenes are memoriable, and among Sci Fi horror films it rightfully established Cronenberg as the master of the genre.

Despite that the film has mono sound, it still appears fine...until chapter 12.  About 2/3 of the way into the film, you can tell they did voice overs for the rest of the movie, and poorly.  The voices are so out of sync with the lip movements, that I was unable to enjoy the rest of the film.
I have the video tape as well (purchased when it first came out many years ago) and although being pan and scan, it is clearly superior.  Not only are the voices original and therefore in sync, but the background sounds are noticeable too.  For example when the characters are talking and a door is closed, you can't hear the door shut on the DVD because the voice overs muffle all other noises.  On the video tape, it is as clear as day.
I recommend watching the video tape until they come out with a better DVD.",1026172800,12,919,4.247126436781609

210182,3,6300147630,"""The exploding head scene! You gotta see the exploding head scene!"" I have been hearing that for years, and finally took this little piece of gore out to see the exploding head scene so I could get on with my life. Except for the exploding head scene, this film is pretty mediocre.
An evil corporation (are all corporations in sci-fi films evil?) sends a good scanner to kill a bad scanner. Scanners are people who have a vague telekinetic power they achieved after their pregnant mothers took a drug released by the evil corporation. There are good scanners, who gather in little apartments in a circle. They seem to be waiting for the marijuana brownies and the poetry reading. The bad scanners pack heat, and the ability to make people's heads explode. The main good scanner and bad scanner Ironside meet in the end in a silly finale.
Aside from the exploding head scene, this was rather a disappointment. The leading man good scanner (Stephen Lack?) is awful. His entire emotional gamut seems to be blank stares and whiny line deliveries. His lines with the over the top Ironside are so flat I thought Ironside might be falling asleep. Patrick McGoohan, as the evil corporation's pawn, slumps in his seat in all his scenes and delivers his lines like he has a mouthful of marbles. Jennifer O'Neill, at the beginning of the end of her career, is simply window dressing to the leading man, running around and ducking for cover. The best actor here is the always underrated Michael Ironside. He relishes his role as the evil scanner, and the movie only lights up when he is onscreen.
Whenever someone ""scans,"" the actor looks intently at the subject and moves his head a little from side to side, bugging his eyes out slightly and sweating a lot. I did the same thing watching this film. Cronenberg has a good reputation, but I found ""Scanners"" a letdown. He let all his earlier success go to his exploding head. I do not recommend it.
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, and some profanity.",1023148800,,2038,4.695530726256983
210183,4,6300147630,"Michael Ironside is head of an underground group of Scanners  -  mutants whose thoughts can literally kill.  He's got a major grudge match going on with the government goons who made him, and the two groups have been engaged in a private little war that slipperily elusive Patrick McGoohan wants to end.  McGoohan brings in unaware Scanner Stephen Lack and clues him in as to what he is, and why he keeps hearing other people's voices in his head.  Lack becomes McGoohan's secret agent, sent out to be recruited by Ironside's group and get the goods on them from the inside.
The film is uneven and a bit slow, but heavy on suspense and pretty good special effects  -  which are extraordinarily shocking and violent.  Lack is a little wooden as the hero of the piece, but is credible and sympathetic.  McGoohan plays the role he always plays  -  the less-than-forthcoming, smoothly sly double-dealer  -  and he does it well.  The ever-lovely Jennifer O'Neill is Lack's fearful and reluctant helper and love interest.  Ironside, who frequently plays underspoken heavies, is at his quietly unsettling best as Lack and McGoohan's psychotic quarry.
This is a very well done Canadian low-budgeter, as effective today as when it was made almost a quarter of a century ago.  It was the first of the government-created-human-psychic-weapons pieces to follow The Fury, the one that started it all, and is generally better than that film though not as slick.",1021161600,,1447,4.893004115226337
210184,3,6300147630,"This breakthrough from cult director David Cronenberg sees a tramp suddenly discover that he is a 'scanner', a person that can read and control minds.  This eventually transcends into a struggle between the good scanners and the bad.  Underneath this there's a neat little romantic interest which is underplayed effectively and an early version of the evils of genetic manipulation.
There are some highly impressive special effects, good acting and some fantastic set pieces - especially a modern artist's studio.  Although often advertised as a gore fest, it's not really too bad until the end.  However, when you do reach the end, it is incredibly gory, so be warned.  The ending itself is generally impressive though.
Still, at the end of the day, this is impressive for its genre but it's not really my thing.  If you like movies of this sort then you'll probably love this, which is remarkably fresh to say it was released during the 1970's.",1010966400,,946,4.918238993710692

The version I've seen is obvious hacked half to death, a few actors have OBVIOUSLY been dubbed or badly looped, and there's just enough missing that I can't buy this is what Cronenberg wanted.
Certainly his taste and developing skill are on display here.  There are some very well-selected shots and clever imagery, as well as a focus on what makes the mind ""The Mind.""  Of course, there's also the infamous gore; blood hounds will get their fill here, that's for sure.  I don't mean to make this sound like a bad movie.  It's not.
I just don't think it's what Cronenberg put together.  I think it's what the American distributors decided to turn it into.  This is fine as it stands, but when will we get the real ""Scanners?""",1010448000,3,827,4.473333333333334
210186,3,6300147630,"Perenial cult favourite that's like The Man From Uncle, only without the jokes. It does have it's own Mr Waverley though, in the form of Patrick McGoohan who wastes no time in getting down to some serious slow method mumbling. Pretension and McGoohan are old friends. He mumbled nonsense throughout 'The Prisoner'. He directed the most pretentious episode of 'Columbo' ever which featured a giggling, existential sea captain (yes, they exist) and last, but not least, acted in the queen of pretentious movies 'Kings and Desperate Men' (the king of pretentious movies abdicated after seeing 'Scanners').
McGoohan complained that on most days there was no script. It shows. A black assassin seemingly killed next to a giant head turns up in another scene at a Scanner refuge. Despite his wacky ideas, Cronenberg's film making style is thuddingly traditional and there are a lot of lazy howlers too. After the conference fiasco, the doctor so blatantly injects his own hand instead of Revok's that the guards would have needed to be blind not to have spotted it. A long shot of the conference hall after the exploding head shows no body and a clean desk. Revok sets out to protect his brother by having a van his brothers sitting in get shot full of holes by about fifty shotguns. Vale and Revok are meant to be older than the other Scanners but Pierce looks ancient and there are a few old duffers at the Scanner refuge too. Kim's no teenager either, she looks the same age as Vale. As for the science, oh dear. Why didn't vale read Ruth's mind in the first place and get all the facts? I would. How can a drug that creates Scanners, calm them down? It should make them climb the walls. The traditional ending of good conquering evil also defeats the whole ethos of mind altering drugs espoused during the film's running time. Drugs are neutral, so morality should not have been an advantage in gaining the upper hand.
I Like the whole cold wave feel though. Everyone speaking as if reading from a telephone directory. Corporations fighting each other with the police not even getting a look in. Just like where I live, only without an accessible corner shop.",1010102400,,2157,4.73936170212766

 But the mental warfare plot, the special effects, and the stunning beginning AND ending, elevate this film above average.  I've often said this is the horror film the beach boys were destined to make if they'd continued down that Charlie Manson path.
  Stephen Lack would never again reach the acting summit he does here, but Michael Ironside is the true standout.  He plays a complete bastard with his usual effortless ease.

210223,4,6300147630,"Movie Summary: Cameron Vale is jerked from his life as a mentally ill homeless man and whisked away to a corporate building. There he is given a drug that stops the voices in his head. He is told that he is not insane but he is one of only a few people with special mental powers. He is a Scanner. The corporation and its head scientist Doctor Paul Ruth clean up and attempt to train Cameron. They then send out an under prepared Cameron into the middle of a scanner war to track down a very powerful scanner who has plans to conquer the world.
My Opinion:  Almost all the reviews for Scanners call it a Horror movie. I don't agree. To me Horror suggests movies like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Scanners has some gore which more than likely is what gets it the horror label. I found it to be an Action Thriller with major SciFi elements. It's also a detective/spy type mystery film. It's all these elements together that make Scanners interesting and entertaining. The plot gets a little confusing in the middle as Cameron searches for other scanners, but our confusion mirrors Cameron's and is intentional. As things progress everything becomes clear. Stephen Lack is excellent as the weird scanner hero. I liked him enough to go look up what other films he has been in. Patrick McGoohan and Michael Ironside also give great performances. Overall this is a very entertaining movie that I will watch more than once and recommend to others.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 1.85:1  Sound:  DD 2.0 Mono. For at least the last quarter of the movie the sound does not sync up with the video. Extras: Trailer only. This is a bare bones DVD with Audio problems, but it is offered at a VHS price.
What You Should Do:  Buy the DVD if you are a fan of this movie or of Horror/ScFi movies in general. It's not a high quality DVD release, but the price isn't going to make your head explode.

They seemingly recruit a homeless scanner and turn him into an agent of good versus the evil scanners. The rest of the movie I won't spoil but it is a great one.

210226,4,6300147630,"Sorry to have to do that, folks, but the awesome potential of this movie's premise could have been best executed by the likes of Don Taylor (director of 'Omen 2'). This isn't to attack David Cronenberg; I enjoyed 'Shivers'  immensely and he finally lost that damned annoying muddy sound on 'The  Fly'. Even so, the movie possesses more than one air of cheap video  nastiness about it. The justly famous head explosion is something that has  to be seen to be appreciated for what it is: a classic effect by the  standards of any era, let alone 1981!
  Down to the acting. McGoohan  is laughably good, his trademark baritone and bushy beard adding much  credibility to his role as the directing professor. Lack lacks anything to  make him stand out which bolsters the realism of his role (another reviewer  hit on this) and the way he is received by the rest of the cast. Clearly,  Cronenberg did not want the raw excellence of the film's novel feel to play  second fiddle to any greater actors. Still, there's a good deal of second  rate movie talent here (come on...we have to be realistic at the end of the  day) and a great deal of budget seems to have been ploughed into everything  but the abominably impeded sound.
  The great dilemma about 'Scanners'  is whether to treat it as a real horror film or to be more rational and  relegate its status to that of cult hit. Bearing in mind that 'The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Evil Dead' and 'Halloween' greeted cinema  audiences with an identical appearance, it's hard to slam this film by  forbidding it to 'make it' also. It's just that 'Scanners' just doesn't  possess as much of the stuff that did it for the aforementioned three.  Cronenberg, while good here, just can't pull off Hooper's spirit-crushing  style or Carpenter's cheap (yet effective) camera method. What 'Scanners'  has is a magic born of a killer story aided by a plausible plot and  hampered only by its competition and that bloody awful sound job!  Definitely worth the money for a rental but I'd be careful about playing  for keeps unless you absolutely love Cronenberg's EARLY work. Remember that  many of his titles from this period have been slaughtered by movie critics  all over. I'm not saying to run with the herd here but I do believe that  that consensus must have been some sort of indicator as far as the  picture's intrinsic value goes.....there's no smoke without a fire,  although the fire in 'Scanners' leaves at least a very well done charred  corpse in its wake.

Watch the sequels to see how much  havoc was wreaked on this concept, and then you'll see the craft Cronenberg  instilled into the horror sequences here.  A suitable cast helps -- the  strangely colourless Stephen Lack, who is an uninteresting protagonist in  the beginning but turns out to be the exact thing the movie needed; Patrick  McGoohan (who later won raves for his performance in Braveheart) adding a  touch of authority and melodrama; and psychotic Michael Ironside.  His  final interaction with Lack, which I've watched about 30 times, succeeds on  their respective intensity, a great Howard Shore score, impeccable editing,  and on-the-mark special effects.
Put this one in your library as one of  the most original and engrossing of horror and sci-fi movies, and bear it  in mind should you ever venture into one of the sequels.

210229,5,6300147630,"This was really the 1st commercially acceptable Cronenberg film to come along at the time.  'Rabid' and 'The Brood' were both dismissed as being a little too 'out there,' while 'Shivers' was filed under camp classic.  All  three of these films do warrant viewing, but I would start with this film.  I have been a fan of this film since it was in first-run at theaters in  1981 & today, it still delivers the goods at all levels.  For  gorehounds, Dick Smith's makeup work may seem a little dated (especially in  today's world of digital FX), but it was considered revolutionary in its  time.  This is one of the films that helped usher in the lame attempts at  splatter/shock/teen hack-n-slash during the early '80s.  Mr. Valenti (head  of MPAA) would probably brand it with an 'X' today.  Aside from FX, the  plot is very interesting and believable.  It deals with the side effect of  a drug initially prescribed several years ago (to say more ruins the movie,  unless you've already read the other 'reviews').  This side effect is a  form of mind control & it is the focus of the movie.  All the leads do  a great job & the music (by Cronenberg and Jonathan Demme fave Howard  Shore) is quite effective, keeping in mind that it IS a sci-fi film and it  WAS 1981.  The slightly ambiguous ending (which follows one of the most  viceral ""final battles"" ever filmed) will leave you thinking if  your mind is open.  Love it or hate it, this film is classic Cronenberg.  If it grosses you out or your mind is closed down to only allow safe, thin,  hollywood plots and stories through, then please, don't bother with this  film.

This film is trippy in multiple ways. The scanning scenes have vintage moog sounds and seem more effective than modern sounds effects.
I never understand Cronenburgs lead males. They seem over the top in a low budget movie kind of way. Even the male lead in The Brood barely passes. The lead in Scanners in again an unintentionally laughable kind of guy.
The Dead zone was one of Cronenburgs most commercial but using Walken was brilliant sending that role to the top of the Cronenburge male lead.
With scanners the main flaw is the lead actor. Being that he is up against some extremely charismatic supporting actors he really needed to shine. Scanners ends up being a great bad movie in that there is so much seriousness going on it would need a fine balance with good actors.
