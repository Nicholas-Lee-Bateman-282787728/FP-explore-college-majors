7962693,1,B000067G15,The video on this DVD looks like it is squashed vertically. Everybody looks short and fat. I tried different picture display modes on my DVD player and TV set but they don't provide vertical stretching. I don't understand how they could release this DVD with that annoying condition.,1097712000,,283,4.916666666666667
7962694,4,B000067G15,"nice dvd....the raw footage is fantastic in the bonus materials...shows ichiro milestone hits, shinjo's 10 hrs and best defensive plays including an amazing willie mays style catch....the footage is from the actual game footage so its uncut and taped live....its best part of the dvd...

the only problem with dvd is that the main portion of program (not the bonus materials) seems to have been broadcast/recorded for a widescreen tv format so when it plays on your tv it looks out of spec or ""squashed""...disappointement there...

but get this dvd based on ichiro and shinjo's raw footage...its awesome.",1094774400,2,604,5.153061224489796
