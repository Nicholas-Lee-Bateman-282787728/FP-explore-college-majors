2067026,5,B000286S06,This was great after reading the story. It being black and white did not take away from the quality as it showed things in the movie they did not read in the story. Also the fact that it was all pictures with the actors not speaking made it even better. They appreciated it!,1319414400,,274,4.188679245283019
2067027,5,B000286S06,"After reading this story with my eighth grade language arts students, I enjoy playing the DVD.  It is a great way to discuss comparison/contrast, and there are many on both sides.  It helps the students understand TONE and VOICE, also, and in Florida, we certainly must be able to get that idea across.  :-)",1314576000,,307,4.648148148148148
2067028,5,B000286S06,"I purchased this video to show my Middle School students.  We had previously read the story so the kids were familiar with it.  The adaptation  was very well done, the acting was excellent and the kids really enjoyed the story.",1259539200,6,227,4.625
2067029,5,B000286S06,"I am a teacher of 8th-grade Reading and read the story with my students, then showed the DVD as a review.  The students seemed to enjoy the video very much and I, too, liked the way that it was done.  I would recommend it for the purposes of review if one is reading Poe.",1257984000,2,271,4.0
2067030,3,B000286S06,"I got this film to compliment a unit on Poe and a reading of the ""Tell-Tale Heart"" with my 8th grade students. My disappointment was in the lack of creativity that went into the film. The speaker recites the story alone for the most part. Very few flashbacks provide images of his actions, and the lighting, music, etc. are costant,  unchangeing with the mood. Essentially, the kids found it to be corny, and so did I. The greatest value in showing it was giving them one more exposure to the text through a different medium. However, I will still look for the animated version I watched as a child  so that I don't have to show this one again next year.",1167868800,33,654,4.396694214876033
2067051,3,B000286S06,"Moved slowly and tediuously. Beautiful language and expressive narration, but little drama, emotion or character development.",1462406400,,125,6.875
2067052,5,B000286S06,"Basically, a narration being told by the star.  Well done for the time frame it was made.  Also, being it was a short story to begin with, it couldn't be made into a movie really.",1453593600,,179,4.085714285714285
2067053,2,B000286S06,"I had hoped this was the old black and white movie from my youth - which I remember really freaked me out.  But I couldn't bring myself to watch this production of it.  I'm sure it was fine, it just didn't suit me.",1449014400,,214,3.953488372093023
2067054,2,B000286S06,The house it was set in was amazing.  The acting was mediocre,1447113600,2,61,4.083333333333333
2067055,5,B000286S06,Good movie I'll be watching this over and over and over,1446940800,,55,4.090909090909091

2067058,1,B000286S06,An amazing story by Poe butchered in this movie.  Hated it,1441584000,,58,4.2727272727272725

2067067,5,B000286S06,"My grandchild watched this in school. and recommended it to me, VERY scary, and creepy. Even thought it was only 28 minutes it felt like an hour.",1364688000,,145,4.407407407407407
2067068,3,B000286S06,"The video is the narrator reciting Tell-Tale Heart word-for-word, which is great if that's what you're looking for. I was hoping for a video interpretation of the story, so my students could compare/contrast (as in the common core standards) the print story to the media version, but they were exactly the same. Overall it's fine, but not really what I was looking for.",1363824000,,369,4.873015873015873
2067069,4,B000286S06,"Great version. Very old-fashioned (black and white), but very true to the original text. I really liked it! :) A bit graphic, but nothing that gratuitous.",1354492800,,154,4.961538461538462
