7373605,4,B013U8EDHE,"Matt Venne is the writer behind ""The Exorcism Of Molly Hartley"" and he does a nice job respecting the first film's story line. He picks up on the established mythos surrounding Molly's fated pack with Satan. Where the first film was good at masking the true story behind a playful haunting of a emotionally troubled high school girl, Venne exploits the demonic aspect to create a familiar, and obvious story line that pulls from all the possession lore available. It does, at times seem too cookie-cutter and expected, but ""The Exorcism Of Molly Hartley"" maintains the initial ""truth"" of Molly's situation established in the first film so I actually enjoyed watching this all play out.

The cast and directing are stellar, both Lind and Sawa give great performances, Lind as Hartley-a victim of circumstance, and Sawa as her savior-who is also soiled by his dealings with the devil as a ""failed"" exorcist searching for redemption. It all could have been too hokey, redundant, or too contrived, but with Venne's script and Monroe's steady direction, ""The Exorcism Of Molly Hartley"" manages an enjoyable, creepy possession flick. Of course I love pretty much any film or story that revolves around exorcisms and demonic possession-next to Satanic cult horror-it is one of the few Christian themes I do enjoy in pop-lore.

The special effects stay a steady blend of CGI and practical effects magic. The CGI is done with consideration to how ""real"" it will look on film so I didn't mind it. It actually works well here, plus there is enough practical, visceral stuff in ""The Exorcism Of Molly Hartley"" that I have to give props to the FX department. And I always enjoy seeing the creature make-up effects when creating the demon face of the possessed. Even if it all just looks so ""Reagan-esque"". The soundtrack and musical score are the expected creepy tones, and even though it isn't original, it isn't disposable.

Overall ""The Exorcism Of Molly Hartley"" gives a nice demonic possession story with a solid story arc, it does seem a bit familiar-there are moments when it falls into the overplayed themes scene in these types of horror films. But-that being said-the movie has a nice devil cult aspect added to it when gives the ending a nice dark ending filled with both the spectacle and the flare of evil agenda that I enjoyed. There is one moment that is more laughable that thrilling-you will see it and know it-but most of the film stays serious, dark, and focused on the demonic fate of Molly Hartley in a more thrilling way than the first film.",1444694400,3,2550,4.830663615560641
7373606,2,B013U8EDHE,"Nope this movie didn't do it for me..... All I kept on thinking is what horrible make up artist the hired, because clearly part of make-up involved honey mustard and a green jolly ranchers.",1444608000,,189,4.588235294117647

7373608,1,B013U8EDHE,"I was so perplexed by how derivative and illogical this film was that I couldn't enjoy it. The opening scene is a reminder that every possession movie is kinda like The Exorcist (no problem), but it culminates in a weirdly obvious rip-off which forecasts many others to come - from raised skin spelling out words to green barf. Then there's the absent logic throughout, most evident in how shockingly little security Molly is subjected to after being nabbed for a heinous crime in the first 10 minutes, whether she's chillin in a doctor's office or sharing a hospital room (unrestrained) with 2 other patients. I love horror, and I can tolerate a lot, but this thing was either chopped up beyond sense, or never had a chance.",1444435200,,725,4.716535433070866

7373622,1,B013U8EDHE,"This was actually so terrible, I watched about 20 minutes and had to stop it. It's one of the newer horror movies that reinforce the name that has been given to new horror movies. It seems like the actors aren't really the best for their parts and the storyline is uninteresting. As for other ""The Exorcism of _____"" movies, I enjoy everything before the Exorcism of Emily Rose. The ones they've been producing lately have not lived up to scary, realistic-feeling, thrilling movies. I was even unsure during the preview, but purchased it anyway. It's one of those movies that have their previews showing the best parts of the movie, and as you watch the movie, you wonder why it's not more exciting.",1456358400,,699,4.691056910569106

7373626,2,B013U8EDHE,This film was NOT entertaining.  Way too many filler scenes.  Sawa's acting was the only thing that held my interest until the end.  Predictable as any film I've seen.,1454025600,,167,4.689655172413793

7373628,1,B013U8EDHE,"Too unbelievable to be scary. Bad acting, bad script, props look like they were bought at Kmart. So fake it's forced. They go as far to saying things like the ""66th minute past the 6 hour"" you mean the 6th minute past the 7th hour??? It doesn't stop there, the ""villain"" of the movie is a member of the Chirch of Satan, a real life aethiest group and they even go as far as to mention that groups founder Anton LaVey. I'm sure a bunch of aethiest who don't believe in a spiritual entity are hell bound on trying to resurrect that entity. This movie is bad. Save your money, save your time, go watch The Conjuring or Martyrs instead.",1453420800,,632,4.275

7373633,3,B013U8EDHE,"They did a good job with imitating the Exorcist, but somehow, the net scary effect of the Exorcist was missing. It may be a sign of the times that this sort of thing does not scare people anymore, but even if this had come out in 1973, I don't think it would have scared as much, because it is not as well crafted as the Exorcist.",1450915200,,330,4.015151515151516

7373637,4,B013U8EDHE,"Hollywood Exorcism, Exorcist Rip-off. That being said I still liked it up until the last 15min. This could almost be a sequel to the original Exorcist movie.  Does a lot of the same scenes from that movie, just seems like it's the same demon from that movie moving on to someone else. I did not like the ending at all goes from exorcist type movie to more of a typical horror movie. Disappointed with that but I liked it better than the other recent exorcist movie The Vatican Tapes. My rating is based on the first half of the movie that I liked.  If you watch ""Exorcist the beginning"" then the original ""The Exorcist"" and even though this is not a part of the original series this movie. It makes for a good trilogy.",1448582400,,718,4.350746268656716

7373642,3,B013U8EDHE,"This rendition of exorcism genre is neither good nor bad, but considering how may crappy horror movies that are out there this one is way above many others.
At the start of the movie we see Father Barrow assisting with a exorcism that goes horribly wrong. Then we see a guy and with several girls at a bar and the guy and two girls (one is Molly (Sarah Lind) )(you know where this is going) is our main character that is in this group. Molly is a go getter lawyer who just made partner at her firm at the age of twentyfour and is celebrating her promotion and birthday on the night of her hookup. Something goes terrible wrong and she winds up at the same hospital as Father John Barrow (Devon Sawa) who is there after a exorcism goes awry. Not really sure why he is there (you be the judge when you see what happens at the exocrism) and he has been **%%TY#@#. Molly starts displaying signs of possession during her sessons with Dr. Laurie Hawthorn (Gina Holden) and Hawthorn enlists Barrow to help Molly.
The story uses some of the same tricks as was used in the original Exorcist movie and special effects (that were a little on the weak side), so we really aren't treated to much if any new fright scenes except for one or two. This one used sex and some nudity to set itself apart from some of the other movies in this genre.
The acting and production values are good, but the story doesn't hold your attention nor keep you glued to your seat as you know where the story is going and how it will end.
The is cursing including the F...word, drug use and sex and nudity, so this won't be one for the young ones to watch. 3 Stars",1447804800,,1630,4.2612903225806456

It was entertaining to see what happened to Molly after she was deemed the chosen in the first movie.  Kind of a female version of the Omen.  But this movie changed that story line.

On on a entertaining level I give it a solid 4 star. I also helps that the acting and production were above B movie status. It's a great 1 timer for sure.

7373660,3,B013U8EDHE,"The film opens with an exorcism gone bad centering around the goof of Father John Barrow . He gets placed in a Catholic institute for the insane instead of prison, although I don't know what he was charged with. Subplot Molly Hartly (Sarah Lind) has her 24th birthday which peaks in her criminal arrest and being evaluated at the same institute that contains John Barrow. Molly is possessed with the same pea soup spitting, elevating, ugly faced demon as Linda Blair who did get better and went on to make prison girl films.

The film combines aspects of the original ""Exorcist"" film with ""The Omen"" and has it take place in a mental institution...and oh yea, it's a sequel to that other Molly Hartly thing. The film quality is slightly above a low budget indie. This is another ""me too"" film in an over crowded genre, that could have been better. 2 1/2 stars.

May have appeal to people who like to watch ugly bondage.

8728852,1,B013U8EDHE,"Ever since The Exorcist, producers have been trying really hard to come close to the original possession story - it's evident that the original is always best.

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie starts off with Father Barrow conducting an exorcism on a pregnant woman. We see the photographs on the wall (of a man and woman), as Barrow enters the woman's room. There's grunting noises coming from inside the room. The possessed woman looked fake (more like a Zombie than a Devil Possession) - special  effects were poor. The woman pleads with Barrow to release her as she is about to go into labor - even her stomach freakishly moves. Barrow feels her pain (hears her pleas in his head) and unties the restraints from her feet. The possessed woman attacks Barrow. The other Priest (in the same room), grabs the woman and both of them fall out the window - instantly dying. The woman's husband rushes in and finds Barrow looking out the window. Barrow pleads insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.

The movie shifts to a scene inside the club - Molly celebrates her new partnership with a couple of friends. She hooks up with a couple (man and woman) and the woman hands Molly an ecstasy. Molly's other friends are concerned about her but Molly takes the couple home and they have a threesome.

The next morning, Molly is awoken by the Police - one of her neighbours reported noises from the previous night. The female cop searches Molly's apartment and finds the couple - dead in Molly's bathtub (blood galore). Molly hears whispers in the walls and then screams ""We're Here"".

Molly is incarcerated in the same mental institution as Barrow. She makes supernatural things happen - vomiting green liquid on her therapist, hangs upside down like an inverted crucifix, speaks like a man, causes the receptionist to commit suicide as a sacrifice to the Devil, etc. Molly is apparently possessed by a legion - the same legion who Christ cast out into the swines (who ran into the sea).

The special effects were poor - not as nail biting, heart pulsating or jittery goosebumps as I expected. Even the makeup used on Molly (while possessed, was pathetic). As for the dialogues - I reserve my comments on that.

This movie was obviously poorly executed - the story was far too unbelievable & the ending was jargon!
