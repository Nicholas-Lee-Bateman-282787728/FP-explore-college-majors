8549451,4,B00AATV0UU,"Here's my review of THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE:
Warning SPOILERS!!! When the body of a young woman is found on the beach, shot in the throat, her face burned to a crisp and dressed in yellow pyjamas, elderly Inspector Thompson (Ray Milland, in a winning role) steps out of retirement to investigate the murder (the first time we see Thompson, he, too, is dressed in pyjamas as he is tending to his orchids). Good thing, too, because the young inspector, Morris (Rod Mullinar), handling the case doesn't know his ass from his elbow. We are then introduced to Professor Henry Douglas (Mel Ferrer) and Glenda Blythe (Dalila Di Lazzaro), who discuss a missing friend named Evelyn (Vanessa Vitale). After noticing that Professor Douglas keeps a pistol in the glovebox of his car, Glenda relates a story to the Professor about the last time she saw Evelyn (it involves yellow pyjamas and a lesbian encounter). Is it possible that the murdered girl on the beach is Evelyn? Not so fast. As Inspector Morris brings in all the perverts in the area for questioning, Inspector Thompson uses his years of experience and follows the clues, including identifying the bullet used in the murder (it came from an American military-issued weapon) and grains of rice found on the dead girl's body. Inspector Morris still believes that the dead young woman was murdered by sexual predators, since the autopsy shows she was raped by multiple persons before she was killed, but he begins to notice that Thompson's methods are getting results. Meanwhile, Glenda is falling in love with Italian waiter Antonio (Michele Placido). The only problem is, she forgot to tell her current boyfriend, Roy (Howard Ross). The police have preserved the dead girl in a glass enclosure and are displaying her body for the public to view (it's quite a sight), in hopes someone can identify her. Thompson gets closer to making her identification on his own, following clues to a Chinese restaurant and a laundry on the docks. Glenda marries Antonio, but still has sex with Roy on the side. Antonio grows suspicious and Professor Douglas says nasty things to Glenda. How are Glenda's story and Inspector Thompson's investigation tied together? You'll have to watch the film for yourself. Needless to say, it's surprising and unforgettable.  Based on a true story, a notorious 1934 murder in Australia that took police ten years to solve (or was it?), this mystery film (it's not a giallo as many people trumpet it, even though the victim was dressed in yellow) is a fantastic piece of storytelling and must have been considered daring for it's time. Not to give the surprise ending away, I will say this: It's apparent that the creators of the TV series LOST (2004 - 2010) owe a debt of gratitude to this film, as their story structures are very similar. Director/scripter Flavio Mogherini (who normally directed Italian comedies like LUNATICS AND LOVERS [1976]) has fashioned a film that seems to be telling two unrelated stories, but it all comes together in a satisfying brew of sex, infidelity and murder. This is one of Ray Milland's (THE THING WITH TWO HEADS - 1972; SURVIVAL RUN - 1978) best roles in the latter part of his career. Not only is he believable in his role as a retired police inspector who hates retirement, he throws himself into the character, coming across as both gruff and gentle and upstaging everyone else who happens to be in the frame with him. He runs-up against quite a few memorable characters, too, including a dwarf dry cleaner, a bearded hippie who like to masturbate, a disabled laundry worker with a busted steampipe and an elderly gay gentleman who bathes in front of him. What's even more shocking is that he's killed two-thirds of the way through the film by the killer. He knows when he goes out that fateful night that he may not come back alive, as he leaves a tape recorded message and various clues throughout his apartment for Inspector Morris to find. He's more than happy to go out that way because all Thompson wanted was one last case to work on before he dies and Milland is wonderful here displaying those emotions. The rest of THE PYJAMA GIRL CASE is equally enjoyable (and sometimes maddening in it's obliqueness), as Morgherini gives the film a colorful gloss (lots of gel lighting) and slowly unravels the mystery with some genuine surprises along the way. While light in the violence department (although there are some grisly sights on view), there is plenty of nudity and a satisfaction that you are watching something truly unusual. Once you hear the theme song, ""Your Yellow Pyjama"", sung by Amanda Lear (who sounds like Edith Piaf), you will never forget it. The music score by Riz Otorlini, which consists of harmonica, electronic and orchestral cues, also enhances the proceedings. The droning synthesizers add an air of urgency to some of the scenes, especially the finale, where Glenda does something unthinkable (but well within her character) to get the money she so desperately needs. The use of harmonica and ""wah-wah"" guitar in the closing scene, combined with an unusual visual palette (a massive seaside graveyard and a bus full of female majorettes in costume), hits all the right emotional notes for the viewer. It's an excellent mix of sight and sound. Also known as THE CASE OF THE GIRL IN THE YELLOW PYJAMAS. Filmed in New South Wales, Australia. Also starring Ramiro Oliveros, Giacomo Assandri, Eugene Walter, Monica Rey and Antonio Ferrandiz. Available on DVD in a very nice-looking widescreen print from Blue Underground. Also available as part of Midnight Movies SUSPENSE TRIPLE FEATURE 3-DVD set. Not Rated.",1530057600,,5643,4.896551724137931

8549454,4,B00AATV0UU,"This three disc set released by Blue Underground, features three Italian productions from the 1970's, all in the mystery and suspense category.  The Fifth Cord (1970), The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion (1971), and The Pyjama Girl Case (1977), share some elements in common, and the films make a rather interesting collection for fans of the genre.

The case grows more complicated, and eventually involves his wife and son.  The violence isn't too graphic, in what is a mostly well told tale, with a restrained performance from Nero.

Set in Australia, this mystery is loosely based on an actual murder that took place in the 1930's.  When a woman's body is discovered near the beach, a police inspector played by the venerable Ray Milland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Uninvited/dp/B00DZP1C8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Uninvited</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panic-in-the-Year-Zero/dp/B000787YOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panic in the Year Zero</a>), is assigned to the case.  The narrative is a more than a little unusual, as it features putting the nude woman's body on public display in a glass case, and follows the tragic final events in her life.

Except for the omission of subtitles, Blue Underground does a pretty good job with the presentation of these films, even including a few extras.  The three disc set is a good value buy, and those interested in any of the three titles, might well consider getting this compilation, as you could get a couple of additional movies, for just a bit more.",1387670400,10,2922,7.824242424242424

8549456,3,B00AATV0UU,"This is a review of the Midnight Movies Vol 13: Suspense Triple Feature (Fifth Cord/Forbidden Photos/Pyjama Girl Case) by Blue Underground.

Overall all three movies were well transferred and in original aspect ratios.

The audio was fine for the dubbed English soundtrack but unfortunately I could not compare it to the original Italian soundtrack because it was not an included option in any of these 3 italian movies.  Although the dubbing is quite good compared to other attempts I am still inclined to watch a movie with its original soundtrack and english subtitles which leads to my second criticism - lack of subtitles.

With a family member who is hearing impaired the option of subtitles is a major factor when I am purchasing movie media and should really be standard on media released for english speaking markets.

Also to note is that 2 of the movies ran for several minutes longer than the original (IMDB).  Perhaps these included footage cut from the original release.

At $15 this release is not too bad on the pocket and gets 3 stars although inclusion of original italian sountrack and subtitles would have bumped it up to 5 stars.",1367625600,9,1150,4.866666666666666
