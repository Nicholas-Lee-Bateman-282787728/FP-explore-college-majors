8122262,2,B000FGG5PI,"I came across Satan's Slave from Netflix.  About 15 minutes in the entire screen would pixilate brightly for a second.  This happened every minute. After five minutes of this I gave up.  Poor quality is one thing, outright rolling flash pixilations----intolerable and inexcusable.  It sounds like from the other comment that this defect might affect production runs of this product.  The movie had potential, but a technical defect in transfer and production can destroy the watchability of any film.",1305590400,,500,5.2784810126582276
8122263,1,B000FGG5PI,"Bought this knowing the quality would be garbage, but didn't expect it to actually be glitch ridden. Fifteen or so minutes into satan's slave, the screen would flash every so often in a bright pixelated mess. This happened frequently thereafter. It happened on a different player as well and the disc was scratch free. I'd say the tranfer was never even watched by the distributors. Unless it is a faulty disc in the lot, seems this version should be avoided at all costs.",1289952000,,472,4.698795180722891
8122264,5,B000FGG5PI,"I just watched Satan's Slave which is the best Eastern Horror movie I have seen. The story is about a famliy who's mother has died and the son starts seeing her in the night. The scene where she is scatching at the window calling to her son is classic. I like the monster makeup also. The daughter's boy friend who dies in a car crash comes back still dripping the blood from his wounds, cool.  The devil of the movie is a evil female demon who preys on those who have no faith in Allah. This is a Islamic Horror movie after all.",1197244800,4,529,4.135922330097087
