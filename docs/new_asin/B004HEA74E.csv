8429479,3,B004HEA74E,the item arrived in good condition. I was disappointed in the format of the second part of the movie.  I felt the person filming the interview was trying to talk the individual into doing things he was uncomforable with and trying to persuade him into seeing himself as being gay whether he truly felt he was or not. The first part was actually an interesting interview which to me was compromised by the later maniputive questioning.,1305676800,,434,4.7105263157894735
8429480,1,B004HEA74E,This would have to be the worst quality dvd ever. The  picture  has all the look of a third generation video (remember  those?). There is  no clarity and often the picture is out of focus. Worst of all are the English subtitles.  Good luck  to you if you are able to read them. Mostly they are unreadable. It is no wonder that there are  absolutely NO DETAILS  on the sleeve reegarding the  company that  released the dvd. Isn't this illegal? So there is no one to complain to. If there is one dvd that  you should avoid it is this one. Really appalling quality.,1295913600,7,562,4.3076923076923075
