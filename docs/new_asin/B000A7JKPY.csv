8075748,5,B000A7JKPY,"I first found Tom Murray when I watched ""Almost Myself"" and could not believe the story of Jodi/Josef but then I got ""Fish Can't Fly"" and found that Tom Murray out did himself in this one.  Oh, and the name, the answer lies near the end of the movie and then it all makes sense.",1356739200,,278,4.054545454545455
8075749,5,B000A7JKPY,"I am not typically a documentary watcher however personal issues in my own life drove me to watch this based upon a recommendation from friends.  It is a very moving look at the struggle some people suffer through.  Accepting ourselves for who we are is never easy, especially when you're different.  These people suffered more than most but came out with an acceptance of who they are and a lot of love discovered around them.  Watch this!!",1320278400,,441,4.688311688311688

8075751,5,B000A7JKPY,"Fish Can't Fly tells the stories of Gay and Lesbian Christians and their struggle for faith in a world that believes that homosexuality is a sin.

This is very moving, if you're interested in seeing how gay and lesbian christians share their beliefs to help you or if you're a progressive church wanting to reach out to gays and lesbains, this is a must see.",1173916800,3,358,4.507692307692308
8075752,5,B000A7JKPY,"There are those who can say it's a choice and that you can change.  Then there are the folks in this film who speak from personal experience.

It's pretty clear to me that even after years of ""reparative"" therapy, rewiring your God given orientation isn't a choice.

This film is a must see for anyone considering attending one of the so-called ""Ex-Gay"" programs.",1144022400,6,363,4.73015873015873
8075753,5,B000A7JKPY,The people interviewed are real and healthy individuals. They've dealt with their own story well and do a good job being honest and open about it. The movie is very well put together. I definitely recommend seeing it!,1141257600,7,217,4.7368421052631575
