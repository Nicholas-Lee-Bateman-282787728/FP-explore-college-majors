5973742,4,B00FB1E9XC,"Horror icon Barbara Steele (Black Sunday) returns to the screen in full Bette Davis mode as Ann, a seemingly respectable old lady living in an apartment complex who has more than a few skeletons in her closet.  A flighty neighbor leaves her young daughter in Ann's care so she can go away for an extended weekend with her boyfriend.  Gradually unfolding flashbacks reveal why this was a very bad idea.  Rounding out the cast are other cult actors including Camille Keaton (I Spit On Your Grave), Ray Wise (Twin Peaks), P.J. Soles (Halloween) and Heather Lagenkamp (A Nightmare on Elm Street).  It's great to see Barbara Steele again but The Butterfly Room would still be a pretty good movie, even without the stunt casting.  Both of the principal child actors are at least as good as their adult peers--Ellery Sprayberry, who plays the neighbor that Ann is babysitting has a very natural quality similar to Abigail Breslin.  Julia Putnam who plays the mysterious Alice that we learn about in flashbacks seems to have wandered into the movie straight from a revival of The Bad Seed--she's a perfect mixture of beauty, phony sweetness and guile.  The Butterfly Room builds up to a nicely over the top climax that involves most of the principal characters who are still alive by that point.  Horror fans should find this irresistible for the cast alone but even the uninitiated might enjoy this as simply an above average horror thriller.",1389312000,14,1435,4.852459016393443
5973743,5,B00FB1E9XC,"I thought this movie was well done. It definitely creeped me out and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Acting was decent. I'd recommend to give it a shot. Some parts had me thinking ""this is really messed up"". Couple of twists. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would!",1517356800,,297,4.0508474576271185
5973744,4,B00FB1E9XC,Not bad the storyline does keep the attention of the viewer in some scenes it is easier to guess what is going to happen where other scenes take the viewer in a different direction.,1517184000,,181,4.352941176470588

5973746,4,B00FB1E9XC,"There were occasional WTF moments, plenty of creepy, minor over-acting (but I think it was intentional), overall an enjoyable movie experience, unlike others where I could've kicked myself for sticking it out while hoping it'd get better.",1516492800,,238,5.45945945945946

5973750,1,B00FB1E9XC,"I watched this movie because it kept popping up as a suggestion on my feed so I caved. What an utter disappointment. The only thing more bland than the plot is the acting which is so distractingly stiff and unnatural that it makes it impossible to get in to. There are frequent undertones of ""Lolita"" which makes the already bizarre relationship between the tween and senior even more uncomfortable.( Semi spoiler alert: There is also a reference to ""The Shining"" when the crazy old woman shoves a corpse through the wall with a cheery ""Here's Mommy!"") At one point there was a scenic shot downtown depicting a movie billboard for ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" which made me realize I would rather be watching a Nicolas Cage movie than this deadpan dribble. How they got Ray Wise to be in this movie is a complete mystery, though I'm assuming he lost some sort of bet. A over-edited mash up of flash backs and redundant shots adds to the drawn out plot line making this movie unbearably long on top of everything. However, I did come away with a moral to this story (which would be apparent to even the most inattentive dunce): Sometimes it's hard to get along with your mother.",1515456000,3,1176,4.631578947368421
5973751,5,B00FB1E9XC,Great Movie!!,1515024000,,13,6.0
5973752,4,B00FB1E9XC,i loved the suspense of trying to figure out what is really going on.  We know it isn't good but not sure just how bad. The jumping around in time can make it a little confusing at time since were not always sure if its past or present.  All in all great characters and decent story would definately recommend!,1513987200,,310,4.237288135593221

5973754,5,B00FB1E9XC,"Barbara Steele plays one creepy lady in a very eerie film.  When it first starts out, it jumps a lot between present day and recent past.  You're wondering what is happening exactly.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The story is so very odd and mysterious it really held my attention.  Once it becomes clear what's happening, it really sends chills down your spine.  It reminds me a bit of the film The Collector with Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar.  I loved seeing Heather Langenkamp (A Nightmare on Elm Street) PJ Soles (Halloween) and Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) in the cast.  All did great in their roles especially Barbara and Heather.  Didn't quite see the twist ending coming. It was a surprise and quite disturbing. A must see if you're a Barbara Steele fan or a fan of the horror/psychological thriller genre in general .  I was quite pleased and will watch it again.",1489190400,4,876,4.636363636363637

5973764,3,B00FB1E9XC,"So,so movie. It had a twist that I did like. All in all it kept my attention through to the end. You had to wait until the end to really get the jest of what was taking place.",1469232000,,175,3.6315789473684212
5973765,1,B00FB1E9XC,This film was disjointed and uneventful. The movie eluded to but never realized deep psychological thrill.,1469145600,,106,5.6875
5973766,4,B00FB1E9XC,"I thought horror legend Barbara Steele (whom we've not seen in decades) would make just a cameo appearance in this movie but I was pleasantly surprised to see that she's in practically every scene in the film and elegantly carries the entire movie! There is a lot of stunt-casting here, not just Steele, but Heather Langenkamp from Nightmare on Elm St, Erica Leerhsen from Blair Witch 2 and P.J. Soles from the original Carrie among others. The movie is pretty damn good and a welcome change from movies populated with bland and annoying teenagers. A mystery story with elements of horror and some weird visuals that make this unique. Recommended.",1466985600,4,647,4.890909090909091
5973767,3,B00FB1E9XC,Overall not a bad free movie.  The back and forth in time was a bit confusing for a while but eventually made sense as the movie progressed.,1466553600,,140,4.185185185185185

5973769,5,B00FB1E9XC,"This is an amazing movie.  I thought it would be bad because of the low rating on average, but I kept watching.  I liked the old woman as she seemed proper in that old fashioned kind of way.  Everyone else in the movie was evil to me right down to the maintenance man and that girl always wanting her allowance.  Somehow these where the normal good people.  It was so real, these people who just suck.  But then the old woman was evil and the people I thought were evil were good, but not really.  This is how people are.  I kept searching for the real protagonist but there were none, and this is what made the movie great!  Your emotional frame of reference gets tossed around a bit.",1465776000,,685,4.248062015503876
5973770,5,B00FB1E9XC,"As far as horror films go, this one is genius. Yes, it is low budget. Yes, there are people who are not going to like the gritty look of the actors, showing all their makeup free skin and washed out complexions, but the reason I liked it was because the villain's motivation was realistic. I'm not sure what the psychological term is, but the Mommy-Dearest complex of control and eternal infantalizing of a child is a very real world thing that happens. That woman is terrifying because she's real, because you can totally see someone like that actually existing. She isn't some outlandish fantasy like the guy from Saw. Finally, the plot makes sense, has clear direction, and wraps up (I shouldn't have to include that, but considering the poor plot direction of so many horror films, it does need to be noted).

PS: the creepy psychological game played by the girl Alice is priceless.",1465689600,,886,4.716129032258064

5973777,4,B00FB1E9XC,It kept me wanting to see more.  I thought I had an idea of what was happening but it was a little bit ahead of my which is hard since usually figure storylines out to where my family tells me I have to be quiet since I'm running it for them and my friends think I've seen it before.

5973802,3,B00FB1E9XC,"This is a decent horror movie. It's more in the vein of weird than scary or bloody, as most of the deaths are nearly bloodless, and the villain is not scary so much as strange. It can also be a bit confusing at times as the main villain has encounters with a few different people (victims), and the story is not told chronologically. However, it all came together by the end.

I was expecting something more of thriller involving some form of witch craft; Anne [an avid butterfly collector] trapping the souls of little girls within each butterfly. It turned out to be about a crazy mother who really loathed it when her daughter came of age while in the tub. It meant she was no longer a little girl anymore. The gist? After mentally damaging her own daughter Anne looks after two other little girls while their terrible mothers are away.

5973845,4,B00FB1E9XC,"The horror in this is watching how crazy the lead is and just when you think you realize how crazy she is...she gets crazier. Fairly predictable on some plot points but overall a very creepy flick. Definitely reminiscent of a role you would see Bettie Davis play.
You have the obvious creepiness though, and then you also have several other layers that are just disturbing that have nothing to do with the lead. Many of the characters, and the plots surrounding them, are just off and it leaves an unsettling feeling.
If you do not need blood and gore(although there is some here) to enjoy just being weirded out, then you will enjoy this movie. The only reason I took a star away was some of the acting of a few of the actors/actresses was a little cumbersome and clumsy. But all the other aspects still earn this 4 in my opinion.",1455235200,2,831,4.473684210526316

The atmosphere of sheer desperation omitting from Anne is nearly tangible!!! The plot is original, carefully scripted to invoke just enough pity for the victims without removing the sense that they're getting what's coming to them. I found the film's message, (warning viewers to pay more attention to their parenting with a few extra tidbits chastising abortion and kinky aspects of the SEX trade),  to be interesting, and engaging. I rarely find myself this captivated by a low budget film, but this one had me glued to the screen.

Was delighted to see her return to form, in all her glory, and really tore this one up big time. But instead of being the victim, this time, she played a female Norman Bates, (or perhaps, even ""Mother!""). Well- acted, even by the children in a ""Psycho""- like serial-killer type movie, but with a thoroughly unique twist for the genre. Good screenplay, maybe have to suspend belief at times, but, then again, so did ""Psycho"", and who among us didn't love that? This is a great "" Psycho-logical""  horror flick that will entertain you for sure. A little campy at times, but that's part of its charm. Loved it!",1453334400,,703,4.669354838709677

Yeah, THOSE moments...this movie had 4 or 5 of them.

Anyway, the movie is about this older gal and her neighbor's kid.  Wait, back up (the movie does this)...it's about this older gal and her daughter.  Wait...back up again...some other kid...back up...her daughter...yeah, it shows her taking in this kid while her neighbor goes off to get heavily pumped by her boss.  Then it starts showing things from this lady's past that reveal that mayyyyyybe she should be taking care of a kid.  Then it shows a little more and it leaves one thinking mayyyyyybe she's just a crazy.

Look, just check out my other reviews.  If you agree with most of them, WATCH THIS.  I don't know how to put this movie into words exactly except to say it was AWESOME.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LET ME WATCH IT FOR FREE!!!",1443312000,,1223,4.690140845070423

5974007,3,B00FB1E9XC,"""The Butterfly Room"" has its moments but overall it left me with the feeling that I had just watched an average made-for-TV offering. The reason I chose to watch this was because I saw that Barbara Steele played the main role so naturally, my curiosity was piqued. After all, Ms. Steele is a horror movie icon of the 50s and 60s. It was good to see Ms. Steele still in action and she does a generally credible job of portraying a mentally-unhinged homicidal woman.

The story centers on Ann (Steele), a reclusive woman who lives in an apartment building. Her neighbor is a single mom, Claudia and her nine-year-old daughter Julie. Ann takes an interest in Julie and shows her how to mount butterflies for display. Ann has a secret butterfly room in which she keeps all of her butterflies. As the friendship between Ann, Claudia, and Julie grows, viewers are shown flashbacks to the friendship between Ann and another young girl, Alice, who was similarly lured in by Ann's apparent friendliness. As the film moves along, we get to see what exactly Ann's motivations are.

There are some genuine creepy moments, but this is usually in the private interactions between Ann and the young girls. There is hardly any gore, some minimal bloody scenes, but quite a few allusions to child abuse and some physical altercations as Ann goes off the rails. Final verdict: worth watching if only for fans of Ms. Steele and for a sense of nostalgia of the halcyon days of classic horror in which Ms. Steele featured so prominently. Other than that, there's not much to recommend this, really.",1430006400,2,1577,4.751824817518248

Ahh Barbara again you've done it! Made a creepy, chilling, horror film that keeps the audience on their toes! I cannot account for predictability as it comes too easily for me...however for those who hold nothing back and take it in piece by piece, you'll never see where this is going.

Synopsis: An elderly neighbor woman takes pity on a little nine year old girl across the hall of their flat. Julie has been locked outside her apartment until her mother comes home from work. Ann offers to look after her until her mother comes home. When Julie accepts Ann shows her her butterflies. When Claudia, Julie's mother, makes it home she invites Ann to dinner and a friendship forms between the three women. Claudia asks Ann to watch Julie as she goes away on ""business"" with her boyfriend for three days. Ann's madness only treads downhill from there.

Parent's Guide: Good age = 14

Gore: 5/10 The Gore actually is kept down to a minimum, it is more the psychological scare. Blood can be seen on various tools throughout the movie, bodies as they begin to decay. Not for the weak stomach but not really frightening. 5/10 rating given for the decaying bodies
Jump Scares: 1/10 No jump scares unless you count the few random surprises. A few bangs on the wall, Ann telling Julie not to enter her butterfly room, and other small scenes.

Traumatizing scenes: 5-7/10
This movie can be labeled ""Trigger Warning"" for those who have dealt with child abuse in the past. No violent abuse is shown as far as beating, hitting, hair pulling, ect. However (Spoiler) Ann attempts to drown one of the girls in one scene, holds another child down against a table, and is verbally abusive (/Spoiler) In the end (Spoiler) Ann kills Claudia and shoves her dead body through the wardrobe as a hysterical Julie is screaming for her to stop. Julie is chased through out the rest of the scene. (/Spoiler) This can be traumatic for Child abuse victims, or younger viewers.

Violence: First half 3/10, Second 7/10
The movie is violent throughout, but in a more passive way. By that I mean you can see her preserving dead bodies for taxidermy/entomology, the not too graphic child abuse, ect. When she does kill people, there an unusual lack of blood eliminating the grody scares. As to be expected, the main violence takes place at the end of the film. (Spoiler) Anne attempts to break her way into Julie's apartment after Julie discovered Alice preserved and pinned to a wall. She removes a spike from Alice's chest and attempts to use it on Julie with the intent of ""keeping her forever"", as she did with alice. Julie runs away, making her way out into the street Ann catches her and attempts to push her in-front of a car. Instead Ann Pushes her too far and lands in-front of Dorothy's vehicle herself. Dorothy runs over Ann to protect Julie. (/Spoiler)

Language: 4/10
There are a few uses of the words A**h***, F***, and S***. Julie says one of two herself. They are not frequent, really just used to express Julie's inappropriate behavior and the adults anger.

Sexual Content: 4/10
There are many sexually references, throughout the movie, but none to drastic. (Spoiler) Claudia indicates that she is pregnant and that her lover should become the new father of the household. Her ""business trip"" is really personal business on that matter. Nothing is shown. (/Spoiler) A contractor offers to do some under cover renovating of Ann's apartment for a small price. His body language, facial expressions, and speech lead the audience to believe the ""payment"" will not be in money. She declines and removes him from her house. Later Ann speaks with another child's mother, one legged prostitute. Her cleavage is shown and she makes sever discreet references to her work. The cleavage is all you can see, and the word prostitute is used once.

Quality: 9/10
Over all I thought that the movie was very good. It was not scary, really more mysterious. Anything scary really came from the psychological punch. ""From my study I see in the lamplight descending the broad hall stair, grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, and Edith with golden hair..."" No demon child this time. Just one twisted ""Mommy""",1424822400,12,4233,4.787671232876712

There was something going on with the casting of this movie, but it doesn't matter a single bit in regards to story, acting, and direction, so let's ignore it and move on, okay? Anyways, The Butterfly Room. A deranged and dangerous woman named Ann with an obsession with taking care of girls babysits her neighbor's daughter, who she tries turning her against. There's two storylines (past and present) going on here, one involving a girl Ann previously obsessed over, to the point of murdering the ones closest to the girl and possibly worse. Is this a good movie? Yes, it's engaging with a good pace and has a fresh story to tell. For the most part, it's well-acted, although there are a few line deliveries that I feel needed a second take. The young girls Ann obsesses over, they're great, it's the supposed horror alums who fumble their lines every once in a while. Blood, gore, and language are all fairly light here. The intertwining storylines can be a bit confusing at times but it's never too confusing as to what's going on to who and when.",1421884800,,1335,4.637130801687764
5974020,4,B00FB1E9XC,"Ryan Phillippe take note: the Scream Queens are all assembled here in this movie. If you don't tick them off your list for your new horror anthology you will be excused from horror movie class immediately. I mean, Emma Roberts, yeesh. Just because she was in Scream 4.  Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween? Respect. But here are some originals you must have as stars or guests, and some of the guys too, because many a brilliant actor began their career in low budget horror.

Let's check a few off:
Barbara Steele (muse of Mario Bava and Roger Corman)
Heather Langenkamp (Nightmare on Elm Street- the original)
Camille Keaton (I Spit on Your Grave)
Erica Leerhsen (Blair Witch II and Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot, Wrong Turn 2 and Mischief Night)
P.J. Soles (""Can't I get your ghost, Bob?"" from the original Halloween), and many more.

Among the guys we have Joe Dante (Piranha, The Howling, Twilight Zone, etc.), James Karen (best friend of Buster Keaton in the 1950s and creepshow star in later life in Return of the Living Dead, Invaders from Mars, Apt Pupil and Mulholland Drive). Plus Ray Wise, one of my favorite actors ever (Twin Peaks). I saw him on a panel once and he was very normal and quiet but OMG he can scare the heck out of you on the screen. Maybe starting out in daytime soaps makes people creepy.

The newcomers playing the young girls were also perfect in their parts and for both I envision long careers ahead of them. So, for all the actors, kudos. This film would not have been the same without you, and everything you bring to it from your past roles and experience.

Another poster said the movie reminded them of ""Psycho"" as it really is from the POV of the killer, and there really is not a great reason she does what she does. The rational part of your brain may say that of course it's because...but it doesn't really tie up that neatly, which is the point. If you are a fan of ""Dexter"" you will know that Dexter can find several rationales for his behavior but it changes all the time, and none of them or understanding them is satisfactory for him to stop. These characters are incurable.

The film is done in a kind of ""giallo"" way, gritty, surreal. It has some shockers.  You can't really rely on Ann's reasons for doing anything because she sees the world in a very distorted way. There's a wonderful sort of David Lynch moment when one of the neighbors wanders out, horribly overweight in his bathrobe, probably dazed by months of isolation or drugs and calls her a freak. The drugged hilarious hippie in the elevator. The way maintenance people are always trying to enter the apartment reminded me a lot of ""Repulsion"", though that movie is from an outsider's POV. You already know that Carole is mentally fragile, where in The Butterfly Room you just see what Ann thinks of other people, and how she views herself.

The film takes place against the bright and false backdrop of downtown LA. The backgrounds are full of high rise hotels and apartments where nobody actually lives for very long, which contrasts sharply with the stratum of society who are actual residents. Ann's interest in butterflies could be seen as a quest for meaning in her life, though she seems peaceful enough with her ambiguity.",1420848000,2,3241,4.624347826086956

I had to watch a second time to actually figure out what was going on, as in a first pass it almost seems like some kind of strange female child abduction freakshow. A second viewing left me thinking it was... a strange female child abduction freakshow.

The plot is, generally speaking, as blatantly obvious and well worn as the butterfly suggests (i.e. the 1963 book ""The Collector"", the recent Collector films, etc.).

You will also notice some 80s scream queens in this one (Heather L from Nightmare on Elm St., the blond girl from the bed scene in Halloween, etc.).

I can't recommend this at all, as it fails on every level, including any attempt at being some cerebral, psychological art house twist on the ""collector"" plot, and never comes together as a cohesive film.

The only positive is Alice, the lead female child actor, who I think saved this movie from becoming an utter train wreck. I hope she'll stay in the acting game as she was indeed quite spooky in her role here.",1419638400,4,1023,4.661111111111111

I'm hoping, due to the endings, a sequel comes out starring Heather Langenkamp. Although that will probably be unlikely, it would still be something awesome to watch. I'll be honest, I checked this movie out online to see i I liked it, and I did very much! I'll soon be buying the DVD!

5974039,4,B00FB1E9XC,"Some reviewer criticized ""Room"" for not being horrifying or thrilling enough--which would probably matter if those feelings were the film's intended effect, but they're not. This film is about slow-burn dread, and is driven by one key character, the older woman Anne in a role that a few decades ago would have gone to Bettie Davis.

If nothing short of spurts and viscera and running around with kitchen and woodworking implements can engage you, give ""Room"" a pass. There is almost none of that. But if you want to see a sometimes-sympathetic monster confront rudeness and manipulation, Anne is a sort of Hannibal Lecter in drag. Except that instead of cannibalism, she's more into taxidermy.

It failed to get the full five stars only because the ending did not match the excellence of the build-up. In thinking about it, perhaps there is no way it could have, but the drama going into the last reel was ratcheted so tightly, it was a bit of a let-down to have the final reveals and clashes feel less daring and cathartic.",1412553600,14,1025,4.752808988764045

Instead, we get to see Barbara Steele play the role of a mentally unbalanced woman who crosses paths with a young con artist. Barbara proves that she still knows how to deliver as she begins to become unraveled (twice). The film jumps back and forth between the past and the present, which causes some mild confusion. I enjoyed it more the second time around. A real treat for those of us who missed our favorite scream queen and the good old days of suggestive horror.

During her days, she has flashbacks to her daughter and all the while she befriends a little girl to fill her empty nest syndrome.

8613951,3,B00FB1E9XC,"I'd say this movie is for those who can appreciate unique ideas, general weirdness, and decent directing. Also, you must be able to look past some bad acting.
This movie wasn't what I thought it was going to be, but I liked it. It didn't scare me, but I really enjoyed the WTF moments. There was too much holding back of information, in order to surprise you with the reveal. Some of it was well done, some just led to confusion, while you waited for the movie to finally explain it to you. I thought the two main leads did a great job. I will say that the story would make more sense if the Butterfly concept was dropped all together, and it stuck with just the doll metaphor. ""The doll room"" would have made more sense.
Overall, if you appreciate low budget, weird movies, that do a decent job, this is a good pick. Make some popcorn, and watch with friends as you yell at screen in disbelief!",1527984000,,895,4.3017751479289945
