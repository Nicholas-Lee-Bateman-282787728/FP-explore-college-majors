1249519,5,B000022TSH,Lengthy and intelligent noir film in the late 30s LA with Jack Nicholson's PI Jake Gittes squaring off against John Huston as the latter attempts to maintain a stranglehold on the area's water supply. An atmospheric classic. Picture quality very good on the BD version.,1521331200,,269,5.0

1249537,5,B000022TSH,"I must have seen this movie a dozen times when it came out. Still my favorite movie of all time. And my pick for best movie of all time. I couldn't pick my second or third, and so on, favorite/best movies - too many good ones. But this one has always stood out because it had a great story, great characters, great acting, great music, and I don't usually notice a bunch of stuff that reviewers do, but even the cinematography added to the feel of the movie.

And for those who are too young to remember this movie, it is a period piece, so it's not out of date. And around the turn of the century there were a number of lists of the best movies of the 20th century, and this was in the top ten of the majority of those (most of the ones which didn't include it mostly included films I'd never heard of, mainly foreign or only, I think, widely distributed amongst their friends and family).",1517097600,,890,4.204678362573099

Yes, it's interesting with its twists and turns, especially the shocking incest twist, but not worth watching if you like endings that turn out well.

As a result, it never got the attention that it deserved (and still deserves to this day) as a premiere example of a film noir drama.  The entire cast is superb, but Nicholson and Dunaway dominate with great performances.  I have this movie and never tire of re-watching it from time to time.  The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and the trumpet solo in the opening and ending love theme is hauntingly beautiful and so ""1930s L.A."".

I confess I like the Mitchum-Chandler projects better; however, objectively speaking, this is a more important movie.  It has the local political intrigue of that place and time.

1249650,5,B000022TSH,"Nicholson, Huston and Dunaway....  ohh ohhh myyyyy!!!  Have you ever wondered if there is such a thing as the perfect film?  As far as 70s cinema is concerned, there was a wide array of terrific films.  Some may love the rawness and action filled despair of The French Connection.  Others may proclaim One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as touching on every human emotion... but for my money, no 70s film is on Chinatown's level.
To watch this film once is pointless.  You will miss out of a vast amount of details, nuances, clues and ironic coincidences.  Nicholson is superb in this.  He conveys fear, anger, frustration, despair, humor and wit in playing a gumshoe that does waaaaaaaay too much.  To take that statement any further could possibly spoil a thing or two.  So grab your favorite person, order from your favorite take out joint, turn down the lights, turn up the volume and take in what may be the perfect film noir mystery of all time.  Part of the fun is trying to be the detective at home... somewhere in Los Angeles and the valley.....  the truth lies.  10/10, 5 out of 5.

1249682,5,B000022TSH,"That endangered species, the pure detective story, came back with a star-spangled bang in Murder On The Orient Express, which had no time for the touch violence of the modern private-eye school but plenty (over two hours of it) for the deduction and surprise denouement that have made Agatha Christie a perennial best-seller.  That was its strength and its weakness: the plot and the characters held suspense and fascination, but there were so many interviews by a garrulous sleuth (Christie's immortal Hercule Poirot) with secret-hiding suspects in a confined setting (a snowbound train) that monotony increasingly threatened before the killers of an American millionaire were unmasked.  Practically the whole cast of characters had been connected years before by a Lindbergh-type kidnap case- and what a cast!  Albert Finney dominated as Poirot, with Ingrid Bergman (winning her thrid Oscar), Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, John Gielgud, Wnedy Hiller, Michael York, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, Rachel Roberts, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Colin Blakly, George Coulouris and Dennis Quilley.  That lot ensured big box-office as well as accomplished performances.

1249688,4,B000022TSH,"I liked this film but for the life of me I can't see why so many people consider this an all time classic! As a small child I saw this film on TV but I'd forgotten everything about the film and did not even remember how the ending went. Seeing the movie was brand new to me. The only thing I remember vividly was Nicholson's nose being cut. Before and after that everything was blank to me.

I liked the location shooting and the period of the film struck me as interesting and quite unique. I just wonder why getting did not do more of the investigation with his associates! It might have saved him a slash across the face as well as a humiliation or two. The end of the movie really dragged for me. I read on Wikipedia that Polanski anted the sad ending while the producer wanted the girl to get away. I agree with the producer, Robert Evans. Allowing the evil rapist to get away with muscling people off their land, raping his daughter, murdering countless innocent people and buying off the cops (Not Much Has Changed With LAPD) and using graft to influence a vote on water in Los Angeles leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. the unprofessionalism of so-called trained detectives astounded me. Those bullets could very well have killed innocent bystanders!

One of Gitte's workers is a fellow named Lawrence Walsh. That was the name of the special prosecutor on Iran-Contra!

I won't go into too much detail on the film. I liked it very much but it really did not move me to the point where I feel it is the best film ever in its genre. Indeed, I think The Big Sleep with Robert Mitchum was a better film. Nevertheless, you will like the movie. I'm the 70th person to give this movie Four Stars and the 856th person to review this neo-noir film overall.

1249705,4,B000022TSH,"The famous neo-noir classic is full of flaws. Gittes accepts $5000 from Evelyn Mulwray to find out what happened to her husband, then accepts $10,000 from her father in an obvious conflict of interest.

The whole movie melts down in the last 15 minutes when Cross says ""Take us to the girl"" and Gittes obediently complies. This is completely out of character. Gittes would have taken Cross down some blind alley so Evelyn and the girl could escape.

The reason for this is that Robert Towne walked off the picture at the last minute and Polanski wrote the ending in his trailer in 2 days.

With more to to think about it he might have saved the movie.",1478995200,,651,4.5

Nicholson does a great job portraying a jaded private detective with little moral character, but just enough to care about the victims and the epic crime scheme he uncovers. The crime and its motives are timeless and sad truths of human history, on both a familial and the broadest societal level, which is one of the great qualities of this film. The characters here are a refreshing alternative to the simplistic caricatures you find in most current film productions, and the actors are excellent. The movie is sad, but its so well done that it's 100% worth watching if you can handle some gritty realism. Btw- none of the gratuitous violence that mars so many current films.

What makes it so compelling is it is two stories told as one.  Your first viewing is the story as seen by J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) who, like the audience is just trying to figure out what is going on.  Your second viewing is the story as told by all the other characters, a story that remains pretty well hidden from you in the first viewing.  Only then can you full appreciate director Polanski's rebuttal to to complaints about changing the original screenplay ending: ""But then... what's the point?"".

1249832,5,B000022TSH,"This is one I had to really work towards loving. The first couple of times I watched Chinatown, I found it to be a cleverly written, brilliantly acted, hugely impressive film, but also one that I admired technically more than I actually wanted to re-visit on a regular basis. My assessment was positive, but the idea that it was a finer film than Polanski's own Rosemary's Baby or that it was roughly on the level of all-time classics from this era (like The Godfather or Taxi Driver) seemed a tad generous.

Revisiting it recently, I can say that yes, there are some better films out there, but Chinatown really is Polanski's masterpiece; it's one of those rare films like The Searchers or Vertigo or There Will Be Blood that seems to get better and better with each repeated viewing. The layers of the screenplay become more intricate, the pacing feels stronger, and the performances seem even better than they were the last time around; re-watching Faye Dunaway and John Hustons performances after knowing the inner workings of their relationship and the eventual conclusion is just amazing.

Roman Polanski is obviously a bastard, and his brilliance as a director doesnt excuse his personal transgressions, but his personal transgressions don't invalidate the quality of his work, and Chinatown is at times almost Hitchcockian in its tone; even Brian De Palma can't emulate the Master of Suspense this well. The 1970s truly were the golden era for American film, and while there are still great films being made, its hard to imagine a movie with such bleak ideas and such a dark ending being made today without being re-written and watered down. Oh, well. A new superhero movie every week is the next best thing, I guess.",1471046400,,1725,4.863945578231292

Who would believe that one could make a story about water interesting?  Great location shots of LA and LA properties.  Love the music score.  John Huston played the perfect bad guy, a very demented human being.  I also think this was Jack Nicholson's best role.  The only downside to this movie is the fact that the director, Roman Polanski, years after making this movie, fled the country instead of facing charges that he sexually assaulted an underage teenager.  Think of Faye Dunaway's role in the movie, a role in which she was raped by her father at a young age.  So I do not enjoy seeing Polanski in the movie as the man who cut Gittes's nose.

1249881,4,B000022TSH,"There's nothing much left to say about ""Chinatown"" -- if you haven't seen it yet, by all means do.  Released in 1974, it features an excellent screenplay by Robert Towne, fine performances by Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, an atmospheric score, and unobtrusively effective direction by Roman Polanski, in what turned out to be the last movie he made in the US. It seems important to say, though, that it doesn't transcend the noir genre.  Rather, it stands as a perfectly realized example of it -- and that means, in part, that the skills called upon by the actors are put to work in a relatively limited expressive context.  Jack Nicholson, for example, has more range as an actor than he shows here, but what he does show here is perfectly adapted to the genre.  It's a movie where to say anything specific about the plot will be to risk spoilers -- so I'll just say, in general, that a complicated plot is set forth with admirable clarity, for all the twists, turns, surprises, and revelations that ensue as it is worked out.  The movie is set in the 1930's, and great attention has been paid to the creation of a sense of period -- the interiors, the clothes, the settings, the dialogue; all have been carefully considered, with the effect that a period in American history that is relatively recent comes across as quite exotic.  The immediate context is that of a drought in California and the economics and politics of getting relatively scarce water to the places where rich and powerful people want it to be.  That's the political interest of the movie -- not altogether irrelevant today -- and there's also the psychological interest that comes with people thinking they know what they're doing when in fact they're stumbling around in the dark -- in Chinatown, in terms of a leading metaphor in the movie -- and then there are the secrets and lies that are peeled away as the movie goes on, until we get the final revelations and an ending that is shocking but, given the whole thrust of the movie up to that point, perfectly fitting.

The Blu-Ray version I saw came with a lot of extras, and they deserve some comment.  I had expected more about the historical circumstances of the plot.  Instead, almost all the special features were about the craft of the film -- about the screenplay and its development.  We hear a lot from Robert Towne, interviewed relatively recently, and likewise we hear a lot from Polanski and the producer Robert Evans about the ways in which they went about cooperating.  Then these's a feature with a number of directors, Soderbergh among them, talking specifically about elements of pacing, cinematography, music, etc.  One comes away with the impression that the whole point of the features is to make a case for the movie's greatness, almost as if it's a kind of ideal moviemaker's movie (one might think of the way ""Citizen Kane"" is often discussed).  And there's no doubt that one comes away from these analyses with an appreciation for the artistic integrity of all concerned.  At the same time, it's slightly off-putting to realize that you have just watched a sophisticated commercial for the movie you have just seen.  Don't get me wrong -- I liked it fine, and it's very good of its kind.  There are more engaging movies, however, and the psychological interest, even for 1974, wasn't as unusual as these features might lead you to believe.",1449792000,2,3393,4.723728813559322

There's an eerieness and coldness to this film, embellished by an incredible soundtrack. The settings and cinematography are superb, and offer nice sophistication, and the acting is perfect, particularly from Nicholson and Dunaway. Nicholson plays a razor-sharp detective, and brings charm, wit, and occasional humor into his role.  This has to be Faye Dunaway's best performance ever, in my opinion; she's a troubled woman who wears it on her sleeve throughout the movie. The ending of Chinatown is a bit of a letdown, because so much momentum was built through the film, only to leave us hanging and wanting something more tangible. I can understand the reference to where they're at (Chinatown) for the symbolic ending, but there could've been more than this simplistic ending. Still, I forgive Polanski for this, because everything else is just perfect. Slow-moving, yet powerful, Chinatown is a movie not soon forgotten.

1249904,3,B000022TSH,"Anyone who says this is Polanski's best...is a loony :0

Seriously, what a disappointment.  This must be one of the weakest work by Polanski, which should be categorized with his other works like: Oliver Twist (2005), Tess (1979), Macbeth (1971).  Even What? (1972) is more interesting than Chinatown (1974).  The only 2 things that are note-worthy about Chinatown are music and camera work/photography.  I think, Polanski should have used more of a jazz score to highlight even more the 1930's in America.  I am guessing its the 1930's and the beginning of Great Depression, by the fact that in one scene the character played by J. Nicholson is looking at a picture dated 1929.  The music used in this film in my opinion, has two sides: positive in that it is dreamy and very noire-estic...but negative in that it can easily put you to sleep, and that is my biggest problem with this film...it is too
plain, too boring, I have watched much more intriguing detective stories and much more interesting noir films from 1940's and 1950's.
Chinatown reminded me of another movie about the roaring 20's, namely The Great Gatsby also released the same year, 1974.  Another
thing is that, I don't find Gilded Age nor 20's or 30's an interesting time-period in the American history.

In my modest opinion I would rank Polanski's none-documentary/none-short films in the following order (1-10...from the best all the way down to the worst).

1. Rosemary's Baby (1969)
2. The Tenant (1976)
3. Repulsion (1965)
4. The 9th Gate (1999)
5. The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967)
6. The Ghost Writer (2010)
7. Knife in the Water (1962)
8. Bitter Moon (1992)
9. Carnage (2011)
10. Cul-de-Sac (1966)

1249911,5,B000022TSH,"You can count the great private-eye flicks on the fingers of one hand, and once you get past ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1940) you're on your own.  Besides the ""Falcon,"" some of my own personal favorites include Dick Powell's ""Murder, My Sweet"" (1944), Bogart's ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), Robert Mitchum's ""Farewell, My Lovely"" (1975), Harrison Ford's ""Blade Runner"" (1982), Denzel Washington's ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" (1995), and, of course, Jack Nicholson's ""Chinatown"" (1974).  OK, so, I've got seven fingers.

Like an intricate Chinese puzzle box, ""Chinatown"" starts out simply and opens up into a labyrinth of complications.  As one of the characters says, in Chinatown ""you can't always tell what's going on.""  Intrigue and suspense are the order of the day, and nothing is as it appears.  Inscrutable, to be sure, and a wonderfully entertaining motion picture.

Nicholson stars as a Philip Marlowe-like private eye, Jake Gittes, working in Los Angeles in the late nineteen-thirties.  We know the time because director Roman Polanski is attentive to details.  Pictures of FDR hang on the walls, Seabiscuit is everyone's favorite horse, and a newspaper masthead reads ""September 29, 1937.""  Jake takes on a modest investigation into the affairs of an unfaithful husband, the kind of case he handles all the time, and he ends up in a plot that leads him to the highest reaches of power.

L.A. was essentially a desert community without water in the early part of the twentieth century, so water became a key issue in the politics of the city's development.  The people who controlled the water controlled the town.  The movie paints a picture of unbounded corruption, with skeletons in every closet, double dealing the order of the day, and evil conquering all.  Everything is about the water.

Amid this perversity sits J.J. Gittes.  Like the classic PI's of fiction, Jake is a tough guy, smart, glib, somewhat romantic, and thoroughly decent.  While he may not admit to being a pillar of the community, he is honest and makes a reasonably successful living at what he does.  It's one of Nicholson's best roles because Polanski keeps the actor's natural propensity toward exaggerated histrionics in check.  Jake is basically sweet and engaging, rough-hewn and somewhat crude, to be sure, but essentially a charming roughneck.  Polanksi also has the audacity to cover up Nicholson's good looks for over half the picture.  Early on, a hood (Polanski in a cameo) slits Jake's nose, and Jake has to keep it bandaged for most of the rest of the film.  Like everything else about the story, Jake's very appearance seems eerily off-balance.

Faye Dunaway plays the female interest, a rich socialite who eventually hires Jake to do some work for her.  She is a quintessential femme fatale, with emphasis on the latter.  John Huston plays a big-shot multimillionaire who could be behind much of the story's wrongdoing.  He may be elegant of speech, but he's creepy in every scene.  Huston's character seems positively ""capable of anything.""  The big film connection here is that Huston had directed ""The Maltese Falcon,"" the father of all detective films, nearly a quarter century earlier.  Others in a strong cast include John Hillerman, Perry Lopez, Diane Ladd, and Burt Young.

Robert Towne wrote the film, and Robert Evans produced it.  The Academy nominated it for a ton of Oscars--Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, etc., the film ultimately winning Best Screenplay for Towne.  And everybody loved the movie.  It became so popular that Nicholson followed it up with a sequel, ""The Two Jakes,"" again with the same writer and Nicholson not only starring but directing.  It's not a bad film, but given the quality of the original, it didn't quite live up to its own competition.  ""Chinatown"" is that good.

""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.""

Video:
Using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode, the video engineers do a capable job transferring the 2.35:1 ratio, Panavision movie to Blu-ray.  The Technicolor is rich, often vibrant, although facial tones are sometimes a little too reddish-orange; definition is more than adequate, probably as good as the original print; and a fine, inherent film grain gives the image a realistic texture.

Audio:
Paramount use lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 to reproduce the soundtrack.  It does its work commendably clarifying the dialogue, making every word and every noise sharp and clean.  Although speech and background music make up most of the sound, there is a fairly wide front-channel stereo spread involved; a pleasant ambient bloom in Jerry Goldsmith's soft, bluesy score; and a little, a very little, information fed to the surrounds.

Extras:
There's a healthy crop of extras on the disc, starting with a great audio commentary by screenwriter Robert Towne and director David Fincher, who discuss the film with insight, humor, and intelligence.  After that is a seventy-seven minute, 2009 documentary, ""Water and Power,"" divided into three segments called ""The Aqueduct,"" ""The Aftermath,"" and ""The River and Beyond,"" wherein the film's writer and others discuss the importance of water to the Los Angeles area.  Then there is a 2009 featurette, ""Chinatown:  An Appreciation,"" twenty-six minutes, with a number of people who praise the film.  And following that are three 2007 featurettes that are really three parts of one longer featurette in which director Roman Polanski and others talk about the film; these segments are ""Chinatown:  The Beginning and the End,"" nineteen minutes; ""Chinatown:  The Filming,"" twenty-five minutes; and ""Chinatown:  The Legacy,"" nine minutes.

The extras conclude with sixteen scene selections; bookmarks; a widescreen theatrical trailer in high def; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  The disc comes housed in a flimsy Eco-case, along with an eight-page booklet insert, the two items further enclosed in a handsomely embossed cardboard slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:
""Chinatown"" is suspenseful, intriguing, well acted, and fast paced, despite Polanski taking things at a relaxed tempo.  You'll find no quick edits or shaky cams here, yet its continuous revelations and perfectly attuned period atmosphere keep it as fresh today as when it first appeared.  ""Chinatown"" thoroughly fits the detective genre, while giving the genre a very special twist of its own.  One cannot even take the ending for granted.",1433030400,6,6513,5.210576923076923

1249940,2,B000022TSH,"This is often called one of the ""best movies ever"", but I was very underwhelmed.  The main reason?  The plot doesn't make much sense.

It's about water politics in Los Angeles, which sounds cool enough.  And sure, lots of these noir movies have plots that are a bit confusing.  The atmospherics are often what matter most.

But Chinatown is supposed to be one of the best movies ever, and much to my shock after seeing it, it's also supposed to have one of the best screenplays ever too.  So I expected a little more.

Just a few observations:

1.  The bad guys are trying to frame/get rid of the engineer of the water works.  So they get pictures of him with another woman and publish them on the front page of the paper?  Why would a paper put a story like that on the front page?  Are we really supposed to believe that is such a huge story and would so easily end this guy's career?  Besides, it turns out the woman is family and her presence is easily explained, so why wouldn't he just say so?  Since they're willing to kill him anyway, why not just do that?

2.  They keep saying, ""They're releasing water at night"" as if that is all you need to know.  It reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark when they say, ""They're digging in the wrong place"", except then I knew exactly what it meant.  Here, I have no idea what the significance of releasing water at night is.  It never seems to be explained and I sure don't get why they would do it if they are busy trying to steal water.

3.  The plot about a lecherous old father is grafted on top of the water politics for no apparent reason other than atmospherics.  It's totally unnecessary and just adds another layer of complexity that isn't needed.  The guy is evil enough as it is; it seems it's only there to give Faye Dunaway more backstory, but it comes out of nowhere and makes the movie look like two stories edited into one.

4.  I had to laugh at the screenwriter explaining the significance of ""Chinatown""  - it's supposed to be a metaphor for an ambiguous place where you can't be sure what you're doing and if it's helping or not.  Great idea; too bad he didn't bother to actually use it.  If you want to make something a central theme of a film, you need to give it a central role in the story for the audience to see what you're driving at.  Instead, there's a blink-and-you-miss-it line explaining it (""What did you do in Chinatown?""  ""As little as possible""), and then the movie just happens to end in Chinatown, for pure happenstance reasons.  There's no particular reason it couldn't have ended in, say, Bel-Air.  It's just because the butler lives in Chinatown and that's where they all hide out.  So the supposedly great line, ""Forget it, Jake.  It's Chinatown"" doesn't really make sense, since it's the first time the audience has actually been to Chinatown.  The significance of the ""Chinatown"" concept is never shown.

So yeah, it is stylish and looks great, and Jack Nicholson is good - one of the few things I have liked him in.  He's not doing his ""Jack"" persona like in As Good As It Gets or the Oscars, which is nothing much more than mugging for the camera and which I hate.  But this movie ain't what it's cracked up to be, that's for sure.",1422403200,2,3225,4.3743676222596966

1249982,5,B000022TSH,"Roman Polanski's 1974 neo-noir Chinatown is a wonderful film as I'm sure all of you are tired of hearing by now. It has been fted everywhere as being one of the greatest films ever made. The Guardian newspaper even has it as the very best full stop end of story. Well, that's not quite the end of the story. I don't think it's the best film ever made. I don't even think it's the best Polanski film - that's surely Repulsion (1965). It is most definitely a genre classic - one of the finest crime thrillers. I hesitate to call it a film noir (it would have to have been made 30 years earlier and in b/w for that), but as a detective neo-noir crime thriller I can't think of another which comes close to its all-round excellence. Another film I love, Curtis Hanson's L. A. Confidential (1997) for example, is a mightily impressive stab at a similar subject, but even that doesn't have Chinatown's elegant simplicity, subtle wit and beautiful construction. It doesn't have the earlier film's freshness either - in fact the 25 years that separate the two films shows the crime/thriller genre had advanced not one jot in the interim.

Underpinning the film's success is an extraordinary and (in the industry) legendary Oscar-winning screenplay by Robert Towne. Set in 1937 and based loosely on real events (the early 20th century California Water Wars which saw LA secure water from the Owens Valley, and the life of William Mulholland the man who okayed the construction of a dam which broke killing 600 people in 1928), the script is centered on a Chandler-esque investigation led by private eye Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), hired by a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to look into a suspected affair her husband (Darrell Zwerling) may be having with a young girl. Nothing is what it seems and along with everything else Gittes comes across he misreads his findings and before he knows it is lifting scabs off various pools of rancid pus - murder, real estate fraud and a giant conspiracy taking place on the highest levels in LA to deprive the city of water at a time of drought. Corruption (one of the various meanings of `Chinatown') is the name of the game and the story unpeels with exquisite satisfaction like a juicy onion, the layers of which get darker and darker as Gittes spirals down into the rotten core of truth in the twisted murky depths. So many films have since been made which center on corruption and the venality of all men that's it's difficult to appreciate just how fresh and invigorating this perception was in 1974. Sure, noir classics like The Big Sleep, Farewell my Lovely and Out of the Past had all delivered sour visions of the world in the `40s, but there goodness of a sort always prevails and the hero usually gets the girl. With Chinatown there was something bitter and twisted that was spanking new. Taking their cue from the moral duplicity of the incumbent Nixon administration Hollywood sensed the time was ripe for films to reflect the all-embracing corruption seemingly endemic to public life. Contemporaneous with the first two Godfather films (also produced by Paramount) and The Conversation, the sour world view purveyed in these films changed the crime/thriller genre forever.

It's an interesting fact to ponder that Roman Polanski almost missed out on directing this marvelous script. After his protracted fights with the media concerning their coverage of the brutal murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate by Manson cultists, he didn't want to return to the States at the time and resisted Evans' initial approaches, but when he actually read Towne's script and saw its quality he was convinced into doing it. We must acknowledge that though the final film follows the original script very closely and Towne is to be hugely credited for this, Polanski made important changes which contributed to the film's success. Most importantly, he ditched Towne's original voiceover written for Gittes. He then changed the order of a few of the scenes and molded the script so that audiences find out about the story at the same time Gittes does. Polanski has said he did this to correspond to Raymond Chandler's usual practice in his novels. This was a great decision because not only is the suspense tighter, but Gittes is made to look ridiculous (along with the audience) by reaching wrong conclusions thereby giving space in the film for considerable humor. One thing that is rarely said about Chinatown is how funny it is, and Nicholson's wonderful performance voices Towne's barbed lines (which were written specifically with Nicholson in mind remember) with terrific macho sarcasm and acid wit which stick long in the memory. The other important thing Polanski changed was the ending. I have been trying not to give away plot points here and can't say exactly what happens, but let's just say Evans wanted a typical `noir' ending with the world conquered for the good and the boy getting the girl. Thankfully, that's not how it turns out and we have Polanski to thank for re-writing the closing scene (he actually asked Nicholson himself to write his own final lines) which remains one of the most famous in cinema - the crane shot, the wonderful Jerry Goldsmith trumpet riff on the soundtrack and the line, ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown"".

The wonderful script is the most important ingredient in the film, but there is just so much else to appreciate here. The acting from Nicholson is simply awe-inspiring. He has never been as good since and I think we have to appreciate how well Towne understood the actor for whom he was writing. It was only 6 years before Nicholson made The Shining for Stanley Kubrick, after which he simply became Jack Torrence in every film. In the early `70s he was still trying and along with lead roles in Five Easy Pieces, King of Marvin Gardens and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, this film showcases his truly remarkable talent. Then there's Faye Dunaway playing the femme fatale `black widow' to perfection with a subtle mixture of sexy vulnerability and neurotic ticks (I can't believe Jane Fonda was at one point mooted for the part), Diane Ladd steaming it up as an actress, Burt Young offering color as Gittes' old client, Polanski himself as a nasty henchman who slits open Gittes' nose with a knife, a host of familiar character actors playing bit parts and then of course the great director John Huston playing the rich philanthropist Noah Cross with regal authority.

Beyond the actors this film has to be one of the most perfectly art-directed films ever made. John A. Alonso's cinematography and Richard Sylbert's production design precisely capture the late `30s era which looks superbly stylish - the hats, the suits, the cars, the hair cuts and much else besides all contribute to lending an authentic feel. The film is just so immaculately put together with great care devoted to even the smallest seemingly most insignificant scenes. One of my favorites is where Gittes is in the Hall of Records checking up land purchase registrations when the snotty little clerk gets up his nose to hilarious effect when asked to provide a ruler. Watching Chinatown is a deliriously enjoyable experience whichever way you look at it.

This Paramount DVD is excellent quality. The picture (aspect ratio: 16:9 - 2.35:1) is superbly defined with colors well saturated and the sound clear. I notice Amazon post here ALL reviews of Chinatown whether it be the old DVD release, the newer one, the special edition or the Blu-ray!! Confusing or what? Anyway my review is of the `newer' DVD release which carries just one extra along with the usual trailer - a 20 minute documentary showing Evans, Towne and Polanski all in interview. This is OK as far as it goes, but the main points have been filleted and posted on the net by Wikipedia - you don't need to buy the disc just for this. I would love to have a Polanski/Towne commentary for this film, but that doesn't seem to be forthcoming. No matter - this film should be in every collection and cheap as it is here, it is probably best bought as part of a 3 DVD set which also includes Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant. That's worth a fiver of anyone's money.",1411516800,2,8180,4.794472005669737

It starts with photos of a couple in the woods. They were taken by a private investigator. Then he has another client, a wife knows about her husband's involvement with another woman. ""Money doesn't matter""! [Too good to be true?] Gittes attends a public meeting about the LA water supply. That proposed dam won't hold because of the foundation, says the Chief Engineer. Gittes follows him, so does another operative. A picture makes front page news. Later he gets a visitor and a legal paper. Gittes goes to Mr. Mulwray's office, he's not there. The drought is affecting farming. [Los Angeles is a semi-desert land.] Mulwray has a palatial home. [On a city salary?] Gittes wants to know who hired him under false pretenses. But Mulwray can't answer questions now. The police question his wife, but she doesn't know anything. Gittes visits the morgue and learns about another drowning victim.

That night Gittes visits the river. A shot is fired, then water rushes down! He escapes, but is threatened by two men. [Where is the revolver that private detectives always carried?] Later he meets Mrs. Mulwray for a candid discussion. His investigation learns more about the previous owners of the water supply. Is there something crooked in the Water Department? Mr. Cross talks to Gittes about Mulwray. ""Find the girl!"" Gittes looks up the names of the property owners - most were bought in the last year. Gittes goes to investigate those orange groves and finds trouble. Men have bought tens of thousands of acres after forcing small farmers off their lands! [Like in those old Westerns.] Next Gittes goes to a nursing home to check it out. He reads the names of the guests. There is trouble when he is recognized! Should he get too close to a client? [No, they'll want a discount next.] The telephone rings. Mrs. Mulwray has to go. She warns Gittes about her father, a dangerous man.

Gittes has a crude trick to follow her. He peeks into the windows of that house. Who is that girl? ""She's my sister."" Gittes gets a telephone call at night and is given an address. When he arrives he finds a body! The police arrive and question him. They suspect Evelyn as the murderer. Gittes goes to her home and talks to the gardener. Next to the Cross home to find Evelyn. He asks Evelyn about Katherine Cross, the girl. He acts unusually rough with Evelyn! Is there a family secret here? [Does this seem implausible?] Gittes visits Curly, his friend. [Is this supposed to be comic relief?] He arranges for transportation, then calls Mr. Cross. Cross has plans to incorporate the valley into Los Angeles. There is a final showdown to end this story. [Did you find the details believable?]

This is an interesting story with an odd twist in the ending. But it runs on too long and could use better editing. Some parts could be edited as not ""politically correct"", needlessly insulting to some people. There are better murder mysteries around, from the 1930s and 1940s. ""Murder, My Sweet"" or ""The Big Sleep"" is one good example. Private detectives represented the small businesses of that era, later to be replaced by stories about government agents, overt or covert. The real history about controlling the water supplies of Los Angeles would make a better story. This would be about the influence of big landowners and the crooked government they control. The one big fault is the failure for Gittes to carry a revolver, as with other private detective movies from that era. People had the right to keep and bear arms then, even in California!",1407456000,,3552,4.789559543230016

1250015,4,B000022TSH,"At first glance, this movie seems like just another detective story, albeit a VERY good one. But I think its a little more. Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense during the buildup for the Viet Nam War, gave a series of interviews some year later. The resulting documentary was called The Fog of War, about how difficult it is to know and understand events as they are happening. To a large degree, the disaster of the Viet Nam war was a result of this blindness.

This is the theme of Chinatown. The murder of Hollis Mulray gets the story rolling. Hollis is the husband of Evelyn Mulray (Faye Dunaway in a wonderful performance). Detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) gets involved in the investigation. John Huston plays a sinister multimillionaire named Noah Cross.  At one point, Cross says to Gittes, You may think you know whats you're getting into, but believe me you dont. He doesnt. The Fog of War. A tragedy results.

No much bad language at all, but some very brief shots of realistic violence. Jack is in his prime. Comparing this to the popular LA Noire video game, you can see much of it was cut and pasted from this movie. Dunaway is also good, and it's good to see John Huston is one of his last roles and few in front of the camera rather than behind. If I'm not mistaken, director Roman Polanski may have an un-credited cameo as the guy who cut's Jack's nose. If was during the making of this movie that the events unfolded that left to his banishment (self-imposed) from America, as he had a dalliance with a girl who lied about her age while during filming. She reported it - I think decades later. With no evidence and no eyewitnesses, there is still a standing warrant for Polanski's arrest, and a series of elected DA's ready to enforce, restricting his travel to countries that do not extradite to the US - so someone else has to be at the Oscars in his place, thank you very much. Talking about the film too much would reveal and spoil a potential viewing opportunity. It does look a bit dated, but the production values are good. It's a modern tribute to the film noir movies of the 1930's and 1940's, and it is done very well.

Ordered it from Netflix in order to watch the beginning and to try to figure out its twisted plot (I never did entirely) and then went back to watch CHINATOWN again, which I hadn't seen since it came out in 1974.  Everything is brilliant - the acting, the setting, the music, the camerawork, the costumes.  Even the plot makes sense, for the most part, though at one or two points characters say things that are out of character (in the light of final revelations) in order to keep the audience in the dark.  Any good mystery has to cheat a bit, however, and this one does so very little, and only to foster the viewer's pleasure.  Gosh, Jack Nicholson looked handsome in those beautiful period suits, and Faye Dunnaway was so beautiful, and so beautifully dressed.  We even get a glimpse of her breasts - Papa LIKE!  The brilliant script by Robert Towne justly received an Oscar, but of eleven nominations, this was the only one the movie received.  THE TOWERING INFERNO and EARTHQUAKE had more, for christsakes.  It's chief competitor was GODFATHER II, another good movie, which was getting the awards that the first Godfather movie didn't get.  There were a number of other ""makeup"" Oscars that year, like one for Ingrid Bergman in some forgettable role, making up for the prizes she earlier deserved and didn't get because of her ""scandalous"" pregnancy by a man not her husband.  Those were the days, my friend!  Meanwhile, a classic like CHINATOWN went largely uncelebrated, except by its large, appreciative audience.  It wd be interesting to look up whether THE TWO JAKES, a much inferior film, though also written by Towne, got some make-up prizes.
An interesting side-light is the issue of whether a ""noir"" film can be shot in color.  CHINATOWN seems to me to use color quite successfully, and much of it takes place during daytime, with bright lighting.

How else could a movie this AWFUL win so many Oscar Awards?

After watching this movie I wanted my two hours back! Very sad since I am a HUGE fan of both Polansky and Bob Evans. Boy did they screw the pooch on this worthless movie.

This movie wastes two hours of your time with a murder mystery that would be disappointing as a 45-minute episode of ""Murder She Wrote.""

Don't make the same mistake I made: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Save your two hours for something more productive ... like staring at a blank wall ... which would be FAR more entertaining than watching this garbage.

SPOILERS:

Lastly, this movie's resolution is disgusting. No justice is served. Our incest-victimized female protagonist is ultimately murdered in the most vile way possible. Our evil villain walks away into the sunset free to sexually abuse his grand-daughter, while our worthless hero is unable to bring anyone to justice.

1250057,3,B000022TSH,"Much good in film, for sure, if you forget it was Polanski who directed it, but Jake is too dumb to make this a great movie.  Never carries a gun?  Meets known villain without gun or backup?  Slaps a woman around because she tells him the truth (definitely uncool)?  A detective in a film noir can be stupid about the women, but not repeatedly the same way and he can't be uncool and stay firmly in the Sam Spade tradition.  Maybe the convention allows for one slap, but no more.  Too many coincidences too.
EDIT/UPDATE: This film is regarded as a great film by almost everyone.  I can see why: it has style.  It has a shocking, fairly intelligent plot.  It has a great performance by Nicholson.  It reworks the conventions of film noir without belittling them.  Yet, I personally did not like Jake at the end thought he acted too stupidly to be believed at time. To the extent that people do not like the linking of the director's life to the plot, I understand this but do not agree in this case.  The seeming seediness of Polanski's life in Hollywood (from what I read) and the seediness in the movie are too close for comfort.",1394755200,3,1130,4.405797101449275

1250102,5,B000022TSH,"Chinatown was one flick that has been seriously short-changed by DVD. Until now. Too many Blu's aren't really that much of an improvement over their DVD predecessors, and in many ways worse. This one is better in every way. The picture is razor sharp, to the point that Faye Dunaway's penciled eyebrows are visible in every scene! And the sound is spectacular, you'd almost think the movie was engineered as a Sound System Movie, which it wasn't.  The trumpet is warm and mellow and melancholy and the percussive piano that foreshadows bad news for Jake is crystal clear and menacing. Amazing that Goldsmith wrote this score in 9 days. The extras are comprehensive as well, including an detailed history of the first California aqueduct and the L.A.-Owens Valley water wars. Recommended sans reservations.",1389052800,,805,5.052631578947368

1250117,5,B000022TSH,"First off, I must admit my total bias as Chinatown is one of my all time favorite movies. I hadn't seen the movie it in a number of years but the plot and story line of the movie are still engaging and have not diminished in relevance or suspense even for a first time viewer of today. Nicholson is as always fantastic and Chinatown is one of his best as the private detective who respects the law but doesn't want to be hindered by formal legalities to get what we wants. More significantly what I liked about the film was the detail of the period in the clothing styles that were worn, the cars and even the furnishings of the offices and houses all seemed to be authentic for the era which added greatly to my immersion in this film. Faye Dunaway who played the somewhat psychotic king pin which the story revolved delivered the emotional tension in the movie as her actions and motives were at first highly suspect but in the end you understood her and indeed felt sorrow for her but there was nothing that could be done it was Chinatown.",1387065600,,1042,4.376288659793815

The plot turns into molasses as John Huston with his signature growl enters the picture. There's a relationship with a woman that Faye is protecting. Jack finally understands what the nefarious water scheme is all about and he tries to get Faye and the young woman safely away, but in the end he fails. You'll find a gem in each performance and the cameo by the director is not fun to watch but essential to the film.

The telling of the rather dark story holds up very well and I agree with all the favorable comments made here.

The remaking of the roaring 20s milieu is well done with autos, phones, cigarette cases and spiffy clothes. How Nicholson' s suits stay so well pressed was my only question, especially in a hot dry summer. Chinatown is woven throughout the film in off handed remarks only to become the scene of the climatic conclusion, where, indeed, anything can happen, but it is more like the Japanese classic black and white film, The Bad Sleep Well, for indeed, it is the power of water resource control that triumphs over elementary human decency in this film.",1379548800,,668,4.7094017094017095

Who would have guessed you could make a compelling movie about the role water played in the development of the L. A. basin--- of course the movie is about so much more than that. One of the things I like best is that Jack Nicholson is no superman. Moe often than not when there is a fight he ends up the loser but that never deters him. He engages in the conflict because he is convinced he is in the right. A favorite character in the movie for me is the county coroner. Who ever the actor is he steals the scene.,1378771200,2,604,3.9917355371900825

On top of that is a captivating performance by a young Jack Nicholson that is complimented well by the devilishly seductive Faye Dunaway.

1250247,5,B000022TSH,"One of my favorite films, and I recently watched it again. This is the 1940's in all it's glory. The film directed by Roman Polanski may be one of his best films. The photography is gorgeous, and brings us to the 1940's that we can believe.

Thus is acting at its best, particularly by Jack Nicholson, who is one of the best actors of our generation.  He becomes the character of J.J. Gittes, PI like a second skin. We know what hes thinking, so he doesn't have to tell us. His loyalty is obvious, but on several occasions, evidence turns up that seems to incriminate. And then he must pull back, because his code will not admit clients who lie to him. The woman in question is Faye Dunaway, looking pale and beautiful, and justifying Her trust. And then there are all the other characters, who are there to float a bond issue and build a dam to steal water from Los Angeles. It is drought time in LA, sound familiar? much of the film is about the comng apart of the plot.p this is film to beho'd. We don't see many films like this anymore.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-04-15

And always at the center, theres the Nicholson performance, given an eerie edge by the bandage he wears on his nose after its slit by a particularly slimy character played by Polanski himself. The bandage looks incongruous, we don't often see a bandaged nose on a movie private eye, but its the kind of incongruity thats creepy and not funny. The film works similar ground: Drifting within sight of parody every so often, it saves itself by the seriousness of its character.",1368921600,5,1554,4.5

Faye Dunaway, like Meryl Streep are probably the two MOST Overrated Actresses ever in Hollywood.  I have Never watched a movie, just because they were in it.  In any scene with Nicholson or Huston, they ""Steal"" it and Huston steals scenes with Nicholson.  This is a Later Noir Film, Directed by Polanski. Despite Polanski's other problems, he is one of the Top 10 Directors of the Past 50 Years.  There can be a lot said for a Film about L.A., which would have been Nothing without water.  The Extras here are important and a must watch.  This Film made Nicholson a Super Star.  Just Jack's presence can make a film.  This was early in his career, he was the Star and he Made the Movie.  Like, I say, anyone of a 100 actresses could have played Dunaway's and it would have made no difference.  Really, bottomline is this is a Guy Flick.",1364601600,,949,4.517647058823529

1250273,5,B000022TSH,"What a stunningly sweet transfer. Chinatown has been one of my favorite films since seeing it as a kid with my old man when it came out, and after watching it a dozen times over the years last night's viewing on blu-ray was like seeing it in the theater for the first time. The picture is almost grainless and looks like it was shot today. The colors are gorgeous and the anamorphic widescreen is letterboxed as it should be, with Polanski's superb compositional skill highlighted to grand effect.

This is what all blu-rays should look like. Add over an hour of excellent interviews with Jack, Robert Towne, Bob Evans and Roman and you've got a true gift for any fan of this fabulous flick, and there's lots of us. I love the best noirs as much as anything Hollywood ever did, and this is as good as the Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity to my eyes and ears, and those are two of the finest films ever made. Everything here is tight and right: the script, the acting, the pacing, the byzantine plot, the not-too-subtle truths about government and police corruption, and the overall effect. It's pure noir in all the best ways, especially its willingness to tell the truths we never like hearing about how we let our society be run by the greediest and most ruthlessly immoral people.

And Goldmsith's magnificent score never sounded better. The sound remaster is excellent and the dymamic range is as it should be, loud but never forcing you to jump for the remote during the loud bits. The extras state that the original score was dumped after early screenings, and JG was asked to do this in a hurry. He scored the whole picture in nine days! Now that's genius, as this is one of the finest atmospheric scores you'll ever hear, on par with Herrmann and Morricone at their best, and that's perfection.

Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood ever got, and this blu-ray highlights that fact in all the best ways. This is easily one of the must-have blus for any serious film fan, as it shows how near perfection this medium can get when matched with a high def big screen and good sound system.

Cheers to Polanski, Nicholson, Dunaway, Goldsmith and Towne for reaching the height of their artform. Turn out the lights, crank it up, and prepare to experience movie magic without compromise.",1363996800,,2293,4.6265356265356266

The whole production, from the great producer Robert Evans, screenwriter Robert Towne, director Roman Polanski, DP John Alonzo (in theaters, this film sometimes looked almost sickly thanks to Alonzo's subtle yellow/gold tones and slightly overbright sunlit scenes), Goldsmith's score, the exceptional casting, and on, and on.

But neither of us had ever seen 1974's CHINATOWN. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Roman Polanski. We expected a lot. We were disappointed.

The first problem is the soundtrack. It's all wrong for this type of movie. It's too saccharine and ""period."" It would be perfect for an old elevator, but not for an old-style detective drama. The story is fine, but Jake, Nicholson's character, figures it out about halfway into the show. His performance is acceptable but he seems to lose steam midway through. Dunaway is pretty bad. It's clear that she and Nicholson are supposed to remind us of Mary Astor and Humphrey Bogart in the Maltese Falcon. Epic Fail. And because it's a Roman Polanski film, there's a dash of incestuous rape thrown in for shock value. I wasn't shocked. I was bored. Then it ended (badly) and I was happy again!

Overall, CHINATOWN dragged and the performances were very subdued. Despite Nicholson's gravitas, I can't recommend this ""classic."" I fully recommend those I mentioned above, though. And if you want a new take on film noir that is truly worthy of the genre, take a look at L.A. Confidential. Note the MPAA Rating for EVERYTHING but it is one of our favorites of the category.

NOTE:  They only go to CHINATOWN once in this film, and the audience wouldn't even know that it WAS CHINATOWN if the actors had not kept saying it.  It could have been any city anywhere.  So what was the point?",1359849600,2,1567,4.68

1250314,5,B000022TSH,"Roman Polanski's genius is questionable. Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother ultimately fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever.

Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted.

Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality.

But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.

While Rosemary's Baby is my favorite Polanski film, Chinatown has always been a close second. Rosemary's Baby has also been selected by Criterion (along with other Polanski classics like Knife In The Water and Repulsion). While Rosemary's Baby has been given the care and respect it deserves with a stunning Blu Ray transfer by Criterion, Chinatown is in a sad state. A film this important should be treated as such.

If you have never seen the film before, buy the Blu Ray. If you already own the DVD, there is no reason for you to upgrade. Wait until the Devil gets his due.",1351641600,,4109,4.717270194986073
1250315,5,B000022TSH,"I agree with other reviewers, in that Chinatown is definitely in my top-ten list of all time, as well. I received the BD the end of August (2012) and have just now taken a look at it. My screen is a Panasonic 42 inch Plasma-- absolutely right-on in its video quality, color balance, and all adjustments (made by myself -- and not some Geek-Squad guy!!). I used to be a photographer for many years, so I'm very quick to spot any resolution and color saturation,  tonal discrepancies quickly. My BD player is the Oppo BDP-93 -- fabulous video processor! Read some of the many reviews of this BD player online -- and get one!

Anyway ... back to Jack, and Chinatown. I am very pleased with the quality of this incarnation of this movie: excellent resolution-looking at the rocks, for instance, in an early scene, at the dam (in daylight) where Mulwray is watched by Nicholson from a distance - every rock could be discerned sharply outlined, and crisp. Shadow detail is very good also. Overall contrast is also excellent. I want to say simply, that this BD for me, and on my system, audio included, is first rate, and an easy recommendation for any Chinatown lover. Sit back and enjoy !!

I forgot to make a comment on graininess, mentioned in another, excellent, review. I personally did not see any objectionable, if any, grain at all, from what I have watched so far. I think of the old B&W print days, and various degrees of grain,  be it intended or not. So, in that context, I did not see any obvious grain.

You spend the complete 2+ hours with the barely likeable persona of Jack Nicholson's role, only to discover that the character you should've been empathizing with the whole time has barely been developed by the end of movie.  The twist at the end is not nearly enough to support the weight of a movie this long, this film easily could have been 30 minutes shorter.  Sometimes I feel Polanski's ego requires his films to reach that magical 120 min threshold come rain or shine, like he needs viewers to make a ""commitment"" to watching his films.  I really like most of his films but they do tend to contain lots of dead air.

Also, the so-called connection to the title - Chinatown, is a joke and feels tacked on.  All in all, this is definitely a decent movie that's worth seeing, just enter with an open mind and disregard the associated hype.",1343260800,3,1106,4.445544554455446

It starred a prime time Jack Nicholson and leading lady supreme Faye Dunaway. Chinatown is one of the great detective murder mystery movies. It's a very dark noir from start and certainly to finish. Hard boiled detective J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is investigating a murder mystery conspiracy. The more he learns the more complex the story becomes on every level. It gets real complex when he becomes involved with Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). The Academy Award winning genius screenplay was written by Robert Towne. Rarely will you find a movie that is this well written. Chinatown is part action, part romance, part philosophical, and part seriously disturbing. Overall this is a very intriguing film. The directorial pace that drives it is truly one of kind. You never know what is going to happen next and then the unthinkable happens.  Chinatown takes place in the 1920s, it was created in the 1970s, but really it could fit right in at any time period. This one is 100% class, suspense, and corruption all the way.

1250328,5,B000022TSH,"1974 was a big year for Paramount Pictures. Three of their films were up for a Best Picture Oscar including this one(the other two were ""The Godfather, Part II"" and ""The Conversation"" both directed by Francis Ford Coppola). If you factor in ""Murder on the Orient Express""(also released in 1974)then you could say that Paramount(under Production Head Robert Evans) really did care about quality in their films. All the films I've just listed are now considered classics. Most have been released on Blu-ray(the exception being ""Murder on the Orient Express""). Last week's blu-ray release of ""Chinatown"" was welcome news. I remember seeing ""Chinatown"" at the Cinema 21(sadly torn down shortly after a six month run of Cameron's ""Titanic"") in San Diego and although I didn't understand the picture, I certainly enjoyed it's film noir look of Los Angeles in a hot Summer of 1937. That look and other details are retained in this outstanding blu-ray release by the restorers at Paramount, who did a superb restoration of Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"" last month(see my review). I've owned every format of ""Chinatown"" since it's release. In fact, one of the first things I did in 1974 was to get a copy of Jerry Goldsmith's haunting and classic score(on vinyl) just to hear that opening trumpet solo again. According to one of the special features(there are about six of them) he wrote the score in nine days at the last minute and the minute the film starts, it sets the mood of the film. I won't go into the story since it took so long for me to figure out what was going on(a tribute to Robert Towne's Oscar winning screenplay) but it's basically about power and betrayal with water thrown into the mix. Lots of water. Other reviewers of the blu ray have commented on the blu ray's aspect ratio. The one I watched was 2.35 which is true to Roman Polanski's panavision version of the film. There is some film grain in certain scenes but this may have more to due with John Alonzo's photography of the film than anything else. For the most part, the colors are sharp and sometimes jump off the screen. Paramount has given this Blu-ray a high Bitrate(33.33) and the results are very impressive. ""Chinatown"" probably hasn't looked this good since I first saw it back in 1974. One thing that I noticed this time more than the other dozen times I've watched ""Chinatown"" was how well Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway looked in their costumes. You can see every little detail on the ties that Nicholson's character Jake Gittes wears in every scene. He changes clothes a lot from scene to scene and his suits compete with Richard Sylbert's elegant production design for the film. Sylbert makes Los Angeles look beautiful on Blu ray. Nicholson and Dunaway do some of their best work in this picture as does the rest of cast. It was good to see Perry Lopez, Joe Mantell and John Huston(sadly all passed away now) in their supporting parts. Once again I'd like to thank the restorers at Paramount for providing another superb restoration title on blu ray.

1250331,5,B000022TSH,"Long overdue for a Blu-ray release, Chinatown sparkles.

One of the best films to come out of the Hollywood boom years of the late sixties and seventies, Chinatown is remarkable not only for its gorgeous cinematography by John A. Alonzo but for its memorable script by Robert Towne. This was Polanski's last film in the U.S. before his escape to Europe.

According to Walter Isaacson, ""Chinatown"" is reputedly one of the films that Steve Jobs took along on his iPad2 while on one of his last vacations (the two others were ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""Toy Story 3""). Sadly, he probably saw the inferior version available on iTunes.

The transfer is competent and bests any version I've seen. The 5.1 soundtrack, though not the intended version, adds a satisfactory dimension to the music and ambiance.

My one complaint: The type size in the cheap booklet is way too small! I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it. The studios should spend a little more money on important releases like this one.

Chinatown holds the #2 position on the American Film institute's list of Best Mystery Films of all times. It also was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won for Best Screenplay. It won several Golden Globe Awards --- Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. In 1991 it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

The color palette is all primary: bright yellows and sanguinary reds-the opposite of what you'd expect from the typical noir thriller. Polanski sets the tone and the period perfectly. Unlike most noir films of the forties, though, Chinatown has a great script with fantastic characters, a whirling, looping (but always sensible and believable) plot, and one of the best endings of any Hollywood film of any period. Though it need not be said at this point, Nicholson is at his very best, and even the icy Faye Dunaway comes across as sympathetic. John Huston is a show stopper as a sociopathic multimillionaire. So if you like period pictures about big-time corruption, water shortages, and the seedy birth of a big city, rent Chinatown. It's one of the best pictures ever made. Robert Towne penned the keep you guessing script. Just another unparalleled film of the American seventies, a time when they seemed to come off the line as regularly as clockwork.",1328227200,2,1047,4.988571428571428

Special features are set to include:

*Commentary with Robert Towne and David Fincher-- Towne and Fincher offer unique insights into this classic film.

*Water and Power (HD)-- In this three-part documentary, Robert Towne visits sites along the original Los Angeles Aqueduct for the first time.  He is informed of the social and environmental impacts and given insight into the major issues around the creation and ongoing operation of the aqueduct.

*The Aqueduct (HD)-- The City of Los Angeles completed the 233-mile gravity-fed aqueduct from the Owens Valley in 1913, under the leadership of a self-taught engineer named William Mulholland. L.A. Department of Water and Power representatives along with Catherine Mulholland, granddaughter of the engineer, discuss the development of the aqueduct and its contribution to the growth of the nation's second-largest city.

*The Aftermath (HD)-- For decades a large rural community was desiccated under the management of water rights by the City of Los Angeles over a vast area of the Owens Valley.  Legal victories beginning in the 1970's lead to successful reductions in environmental damages and the restoration of some natural habitats.  Historians, local ranchers and activists discuss the up-to-date impacts of the aqueduct and struggle to maintain a stable environment and community.

*The River & Beyond (HD)-- Prior to the building of the first aqueduct a century ago Los Angeles relied solely on its own local water supply: the Los Angeles River and its aquifer.  Today the river as a water resource is largely forgotten. Currently there are plans to re-develop the river to reduce L.A.'s dependence on imported water, reducing the environmental impact on distant communities, while creating parks and open spaces for the city.

*Chinatown: An Appreciation-- In this featurette, prominent filmmakers express their personal admiration for the film: Steven Soderbergh - Director ( Traffic), James Newton Howard - Composer ( The Dark Knight), Kimberly Peirce - Writer/Director ( Boys Don't Cry), and Roger Deakins - Cinematographer ( No Country For Old Men).

It bothers me to no end that I have to delete my past reviews to accomodate a new review of a newer version. This will be the third time I reviewed a home video product of this masterpiece. No matter how many formats (from Beta tape) this film really ""shines"" on blu ray. I didn't know what to expect because I remember all the past versions being ""hazy"" like a film noir should look, but that haze is gone and the detail really stands out! The colors are bold and are not brown tinted (like on the laserdisc) and really gives this classic a new life. I will never forget seeing this for the first time in widescreen. Did not realize how much was cropped off for pan and scan versions. And this blu ray reminds me of the first time witnessing this in widescreen. This is one lovely looking picture. The whole frame is being used beautifully.
The sound is Dolby True HD 5.1 or mono. The 5.1 is preferred, even though it sounds mono in nature.
The special features are good too. The best, to me, is the one with Roman Polanski (and others) discussing the making of the film. This special feature is worth the price alone! I have always been fascinated with Polanski and his film making style and to see and hear him discuss this classic is pure joy for me. They don't make films like this anymore!!
I am so glad to see this classic at its best in 1080p. Can't wait for a new format with higher resolution to come along and replace blu ray, but I will settle for this version for now.
This is the ultimate way to view this great piece of art.

One of the recurring things read is that this movie was a big influence. I can tell that statement is the truth. From themes like money and power having great influence over institutions. The Underdog out of his depth facing the all powerful opportunist. I can quite see the similarities between both protagonist Jake and Hank. I am happy to experience both. I watch China town twice and also gave terriers mutiple viewings. I hope that this brand storytelling has bigger future in next couple of decades.,1306540800,,635,4.834862385321101

Just a note from a technical perspective: my release (2007's ""Special Collector's Edition"") is very nice in terms of picture and sound. The only important feature it lacks from the more recent 2009&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/release/dp/B002HK9HR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">release</a>&nbsp;is a commentary track.

Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway (and all the other actors, without exception) were at peak performance.  The story was crisp and tense and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The cinematography was stunning.  (Okay, maybe the music could have been a drop better, but it was still quite good enough.)  And what I loved was that you really didn't know where the plot was going.  I'm so sick of the average Hollywood movie that feeds you what it wants and lets you know exactly what to expect.

I had trouble getting into JN's character. He toned down the overacting to such an extent that I found his character rather bland. Brilliant that he spends half the movie wearing a stupid looking bandage on his nose, and still gets the girl.

So RP sets us up to believe that they are going to escape to Mexico, but in reality she heroine gets shot and probably dies, her father wins ... Ok, that's a nice unexpected cruel twist to the end, but what did happen to their ride to Mexico? Why were they riding in their car knowing that anyone could find them (and of course everyone did)? Why would a police officer fire live ammunition at a car containing an innocent young girl in the middle of a crowded street in Chinatown? Did he go to prison?

1250349,4,B000022TSH,"Everything about the style and substance of Polanski's legendary 'Chinatown' has been covered thoroughly in the surrounding reviews.  This is simply to clarify what's included in the 2009 Centennial Collection edition (recently discontinued) of the film versus earlier versions: new features in this two-disc release are an audio commentary by CT screenwriter Robert Towne with David Fincher (the director of 'Seven' and 'Fight Club' I presume); 'Chinatown: an Appreciation,' a 26-minute documentary composed mainly of interviews with a handful of unrelated Hollywood illuminati; and three marginally interesting featurettes delving into the technical background of CT's 'Water and Power' plot thread.  The transfer and other bonus material (three mini-docs with insights from Nicholson, Polanski, Towne and producer Robert Evans, plus theatrical trailer) seem to be identical to those that appear on the 2007 Special Collector's Edition.  For completists, all that's missing here is the 13-minute Nicholson-Polanski-Towne-Evans interview featurette which can be found on the original CT DVD release (and 2006 re-release), although this becomes more or less redundant if you have the three mini-docs.

1250351,5,B000022TSH,"This is a remarkable film, possibly the best work of it's director, Polanski, it's leading actor, Nicholson, and it's screenwriter, Towne. The film is bathed in sun-drenched landscapes suggesting dehydration and water scarcity. This film works at a leisurely pace and is a loving recreation of 30s noir. Jake Gittes is a well-dressed private eye,who has a dark past as a Chinatown cop, he'd rather not talk about. As played by Nicholson he is a cynical, cool operator with a hint of vulnerability and makes enough to hire two co-workers. He works in the field of divorce and adultery. The title is more about a state of mind: everybody does as little as possible, and if you help people you make sure you hurt them. But the film ends in Chinatown. The main subject is water shortages and the corrupt diversion of water supplies from the LA populace to irrigate orange groves. There is also land theft going on: bought cheaply and sold at enormously inflated prices.

Against this public corruption, there is a story of incest and sexual scandal, all coming together in the figure of Noah Cross(Huston),played malevolently with great swaggering malice. He ""owns"" the future and pulls all the strings, leading to the murder of Hollis Mulwray, his business partner, and Chief Engineer of the LA Water Department. Hollis's wife, Evelyn(Dunnaway), sets Gittes on the trail of what happened. She is a very alluring femme-fatale with many secrets,which she slowly reveals to Gittes. She is Cross's daughter and she seems to know about the young woman her husband was supposed to be having an affair with. Nicholson changes from a dapper, witty , charming teller of jokes to a man who gets in over his head and becomes bloodied,bowed but doggedly determined to unravel the whole sorry mess.

The cinematography is excellent with low horizon wide screen vistas of muted colours and radiant light. We are between the desert and the sea with low-slung architecture and nothing to blot out the sunlight but shadow. The music is jagged and drawn out. This is Polanski's first Hollywood film since the murder of his wife, Sharon Tate in 1969. It was also with the forthcoming sex trial, going to be his last. His future might have been different. He imbues the film with a sense of Greek tragedy,giving it the darkest(and best) ending possible, taking your breath away. He plays a mean cameo role as the midget who slices Nicholson's nose. Faye Dunnaway is remarkable in the role of a patrician lady with a dark vulnerability. Nicholson never acted better, with `The Passenger' and `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' ahead. The script is lean, tight and full of witty lines(it went on to win Oscar for screenplay).This is real noir without one clich, and real backbone and bite. Polanski's personal tragedies have a great bearing on the crushing despondency of the outcome.",1272153600,,2858,4.902892561983471
1250352,5,B000022TSH,"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""

He didn't say any more, but in considering the life of a certain individual who goes by the name of Roman Polanski, I'm inclined to reserve judgment. Let the courts decide his fate. Why is a raven like a writing desk? Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

As for his oeuvre, that's another matter. I will judge that until the cows come home. And my judgment is this: Chinatown is a great film by a great director, Roman Polanski; with a great script by Robert Towne; and a great actor, Jack Nicholson; a great actress, Faye Dunaway; and a pivotal performance by another great director, John Huston.

Chinatown is kind of a roman  clef, if you will, where Noah Cross, played by director John Huston, stands in for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power director William Mulholland (1855-1935), the man who created modern Los Angeles out of a desert by adding water and stirring.

---------
Noah Cross: Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
=====================

Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private eye who usually handles divorce cases. When the wife of the director of the water department comes in he tells her that if she loves him, it might be better not to know. Later, when the real Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes in he starts to realize that there is a lot more to the case than meets the eye. He wants to help the real Mrs. Mulwray but senses that she is hiding something. Is she ever. Gittes sticks his nose into other peoples business and almost gets it cut off for his trouble, but he can't stop until he gets to the gritty truth.

If Humphrey Bogart's detective in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (directed, by the way, by John Huston) was the prototype, then Jake Gittes was the updated, post-modern version. Where Bogart lacked the classic leading man good looks, Nicholson took it even further, with a receding hairline and a face somewhere between Mickey Mouse and the wolf in a Tex Avery cartoon. He is crass and crude, but buried deep within there is the desire to do the righteous thing. The whole genre of film noir is updated in ""Chinatown."" Instead of a case involving a fabulous jewel, the stuff from which dreams are woven, we have instead a case involving water, and the crime and corruption it took to deliver that water to Los Angeles. Water, Power, Hollywood--the real stuff from which dreams are woven!

Nicholson was born to play Private Investigator Jake Gittes. Or rather, Robert Towne wrote the role with Nicholson in mind. He was a friend of Jack's, and modeled Jake's dialogue after Nicholson's distinctive mode of speech.

The story goes that Producer Robert Evans wanted Towne to do a screenplay based on The Great Gatsby, but Towne didn't want to take on F. Scott Fitzgerald. I know the feeling. Though he was offered $175,000 to do the Gatsby script, he said that for only $25,000 he'd do an original script based on something a Los Angeles police officer had told him when asked what he used to do while working in Chinatown:

""As little as possible.""

The cop explained that since they couldn't speak Chinese, they couldn't decipher what was really going on, and therefore couldn't tell if their actions were preventing crime, or helping the criminals commit a crime under the color of the law. So they did as little as possible.

Throughout ""Chinatown,"" the film, the idea of Chinatown as a place or situation where the standard moral compass is no help to navigation runs like a Chinese wall. The film is really about Los Angeles--and why it is called Chinatown might seem like an enigma--but after watching it you'll know exactly what is meant.

The film might seem slow paced in parts, as layer after layer of the puzzle is slowly peeled away, but it is tightly written by Robert Towne, nothing is wasted, and even when nothing much happens, the tension is being ratcheted up. Take for instance a scene in the Hall of Records where Gittes encounters an officious petty pimple faced bureaucrat. Or the scene where Gittes visits the office of the director of the water department and annoys the secretary. The tension continually builds. It is all so very Hitchcockian.

And speaking of Alfred, Polanski pulls a Hitchcock by appearing in the film himself. I won't blow his cover, but no doubt the role was a way for Polanski and Nicholson to blow off some steam. The relations between director and star--as well as between the director and the screenwriter, and the director and the leading lady--were notoriously contentious. Polanski even smashed Jack's portable TV with a mop as he was fed up with Jack always stalling his scenes so he could watch L.A. Lakers games.

--------
Noah Cross: I don't blame myself. You see, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING.
=============

Though all the aspects of ""Chinatown"" were top notch, a final 'note' on the soundtrack is in order, pun intended. Parts of the score reminded me of ""The Planet of The Apes"" where percussion punctuates the mounting tension. But in a good way. Other parts used Jazz and Pop songs from the era (mid to late 30's, early 40's) to give a feel for the period. Sometimes the tunes were echoed by the actors, like when Jake Gittes is waiting in the Water and Power Department office, annoying the secretary by humming and singing said songs. The best moments though are the beautiful trumpet solos that were played by Hollywood studio veteran Uan Rasey.

""Chinatown"" was Roman Polanski's last American film before he fled the country, so far never to return--unless he is extradited.

1250353,5,B000022TSH,I am wondering when this movie will be available in Blu ray. It's a masterpiece.,1267660800,,80,4.4
1250354,5,B000022TSH,"Chinatown is a dark bit of neo-noir cinema directed by the great Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and starring three time Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson (both of whom are no strangers to dark stories).  So to say that Chinatown is a journey into the darkside of humanity is putting this gloomy story lightly.  Everything about this movie has a lingering feel to it that refuses to leave a viewer's head.  Is it the characters or the plot?  It's both.  Chinatown is a mystifying puzzle of a film that immerses its viewers into its world.

Chinatown is not a nice film, being in no way your typical Hollywood picture.  I could really feel how this film was made during the Vietnam War because everything about it is very cynical to say the least.  The characters are hateful and are constantly following questionable and deplorable morals in order to finish their jobs.  In a normal Hollywood picture a man like Jake might be looked down upon, but in Chinatown the other characters are so cruel that the stubborn detective becomes an enormously charismatic lead.  He's sarcastic as well as a scoundrel, but that's Jake's charm.  He likes to put things bluntly in an often *dark* comical light.  Jake can be beat down, sliced up, and shot at yet will keep on going in search of the truth.  It's a determination that can't be healthy for the character, but admirable nonetheless.  How he keeps such good humor about the events is anyone's guess.

Jack Nicholson's performance is one of the best I've seen out of him (and that's saying something) truly embodying J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes; I really believed that this character could be for real.  Jake Gittes will bring you into Chinatown with a fast tongue and scathing sarcasm.

With such a bleak film it's almost hard to believe it can be such a beloved classic, yet here it remains as one of the greatest films of all time.  But why is this?  People always seem to look for happy endings; a quick fix that wraps the story up in a tidy little package.  While some may view Chinatown's ending as a flaw it is in actuality one of the things that makes it a stand out movie.

The sad, quite frankly, tragic ending is one that lingered in my mind (and I'm sure those of everyone else who saw it) long after it had ended.  Chinatown isn't meant to please its viewer.  It succeeds because it challenges the viewer to look into the dark reality of life while also questioning what the characters in the film might have done differently.  A tale of murder, dumping water and incest might not be good for a mainstream audience, but for viewers who want a movie that stimulates all their senses there are few better than Roman Polanski's Chinatown.

Roman Polanski (current felon, but we won't go there) directed what many see as one of his masterpieces of cinema back in 1974. Jack definitely channels Bogart with some Raymond Chandler and some hard-boiled detective action.

The film does not lack from interest --- the mystery gets deeper and deeper and just when you think you have the story figured out, another twist. But how many times can I watch Gittes climb a chain link fence? And the cameo of Polanski as a thug made no sense at all to the story. Who was this gangster working for? What's the relationship with some of the men he tangles with? What's the relation between the farmers and Faye Dunaway's character?

Odd, insightful and looong. Rather than watch a neo-noir film, take in a Maltese Falcon or the Big Sleep! For what it does, Chinatown does succeed as a murder mystery in 1930s LA. But my heart belongs to Bogie.

Roman Polanski did not want to return to Hollywood after the murder of Sharon Tate, but came back to do this at the request of Jack Nicholson. Robert Towne had passed on writing the screen play for Robert Redford's 'Great Gatsby' because he didn't want to kill his career by abusing a literary classic. He had written this screen play specifically for Jack Nicholson who was his friend and ex-roommate.

Fortunately for Polanski the film was produced by Robert Evans who had the genius of letting great directors direct. Polanski notes in the documentaries that Evans more than anyone else made this film a great movie.

Although it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, Towne was the only winner for original screen play. Guess what movie won that year, 1974? 'The Godfather II,' kind of stiff competition.

Polanski now says than after 'The Pianist' this is probably his best movie, even though at the time he was just anxious to get it over and get back to Europe.

There are no mis-steps in this that I can see. There has been a lot of debate over the ending, but I can't imagine it any other way. A truly great movie.",1247097600,5,1368,4.659751037344399

He is skilled as an investigator and smart, but gets in way over his head.  Dunaway, the femme fatale who is the only person with a clear idea of diong good, also defies simple labels.  Their performances are amongst the finest of their careers, so good they have to been seen and savored more than once.

""Chinatown"" (1974) may be the best screenplay ever written. A historical look at 1930s Los Angeles, it actually condensed events from the 1900s with events that, uh, never happened but made for good drama. Written by L.A. native Robert Towne, directed by Roman Polanski, produced by Evans and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunnaway and famed director John Huston, it told the story of how Los Angeles became a metropolis. In Towne's version, Huston ""owns"" the L.A. Department of Water & Power with a character based on actual L.A. City engineer William Mulholland. Mulholland had orchestrated the political deal which built the aqueduct that brought water from the Owens Valley into the L.A. Basin, allowing millions of Southern Californians to keep their lawns green to this day.
The Mulholland character is ""sacrificed"" at the altar of greed, embodied by Huston, who secretly buys the San Fernando Valley, knowing that once the water deal is set, it will be incorporated into the city, making him a gazillionaire. It is rather cynical, although nobody suggests the L.A. ""city fathers"" were boy scouts. The same old theme is that capitalism and American political power are corrupt. To make sure the audience is convinced the corruption is beyond redemption, Huston is in the end found out be an insatiable, incestual monster. He plays the role so well it brings up minds-eye imagery of his real daughter, Angelica. The film is utterly beyond any criticism, regardless of political colorization. For decades, film students and screenwriters have studied it. It spawned an artistic quest to lace the screen with symbols, metaphors, backstory, and twists.
""Chinatown"" seems to be the apex of the American film period, the mid-1970s. The period from 1960 to 1979 is unparalleled, but the backstory of the people who created these classics is a telling tale of why the genre leans to the Left. In the 1960s, film schools became popular. Four schools emerged, and have held their place as the place to learn the craft. In Los Angeles there was the USC School of Cinema-Television. Their first big alumnus was ""Star Wars"" director George Lucas. UCLA combined their film school with their drama program, so as to bring actors, writers, directors and producers together. Coppola went to UCLA along with a future rock star named Jim Morrison, who would form The Doors with another UCLA film alumnus, keyboardist Ray Manzarek.",1233878400,3,2596,5.110588235294117

At first we think it is one more private eye's business or investigation in some kind of affair with some married man. But it does not fit at all with the professional dedication  of the suspected unfaithful man. He is obviously looking for something fishy in the water supply of Los Angeles he is responsible for. But then he does meet with a girl, doesn't he after all. And yet there is something fishy in that water supply. So it might be a big embezzlement case. Let Los Angeles pay for the water they will never get and then let Los Angeles get to the water where it will be, and let them pay again. The point is it does not explain everything, and especially why the thieving contractor is so keen on getting the hooker his son in law was seeing. Too keen to be honest. Is she a hooker after all? And we go on doubting, hoping, being disappointed and never getting to the truth of the business. Who the killer really is? Who the police really work for? Who the police tries to protect and cover? Why do the police do that unprofessional act? There is just no good enough answer, and even at the end, when the tycoon contracting embezzler gets the last word we know we are off the point and losing all footing in too deep water. That's probably the best part of this film. You just have to accept the situation the way it is and do nothing just because some people are big enough, rich enough or powerful enough to do exactly what they want and everyone else has only one choice, die or say yes-sir-mister-master-sir-boss. Even killing his own child is not a no-go option for such a greedy person. Remember, change we can, but change these tycoons cannot. So better change them than expect them to  change. Why not send them on a perpetual vacation in some desert island that has absolutely no connection with the outside world, But dummy, that's just the point, such a place does not exist. So better put them to death, put them to sleep or deep freeze them if you don't want to deep fry them, which stinks a little bit. But any other way will let them go on  with their shaggy and dirty business. But gosh it reaps a lot of profit in. Look at Madoff.

1250373,4,B000022TSH,"""Chinatown"" represents an updating of the great noir films of the past such as ""Double Indemnity"" and especially of ""Maltese Falcon"" which happens to be together with ""Sunset Boulevard"" my favourite representatives of the genre although ""Chinatown"" more closely resembles the ""Maltese Falcon"".  Nicholson parallels Bogart here and Dunaway does Astor and ironically John Huston, the director of the ""Maltese Falcon"" has an acting role here.

""Chinatown"" does a great job in bringing the noir genre into the colour-age and does so very well by incorporating the best of the old black and white films into the more modern film making elements of the time.  This film has gone on to influence even more modern films like ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" and its theme of corrupt police and their evil rich backers who get away with anything with an excellent plot and great acting by Dunaway, Huston and Nicholson make this a great film to watch.

The only problem is with the very poor picture quality which really should have been restored although they did a pretty good job with the sound quality which has been a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option.  The picture quality have a number of imperfections such as white spots and barely reaches VHS quality.  As Roman Polanski is still alive the last I checked, they really should try and do a Director's Cut version with restored and remastered picture and sound quality before it's too late.

I'd recommend giving this dvd version of the movie a miss at least until they come up with a much better restored version preferably together with a Director's Cut either on standard or Blu-ray formats.

Updated 30 May 2013:

That's more like it!  Not only does this Bluray release come in a very neat looking Steelbook, the picture quality has improved substantially from the standard dvd version and while some grain is visible I'm personally fine with that.  The sound quality has also improved but not as much relative to the video; the soundtrack is still a lot louder than the spoken track and under the DolbyTrueHD 5.1 mode you have to struggle to hear some of the dialogue while the music blasts quite loudly at some points.  Otherwise this is a worthy upgrade and I've added 2 stars to my previous review of the standard dvd version above.

Many of the plot elements fit the film noir genre but visually it was a little harder for me to see. I enjoyed watching the film but the ending changed my opinion a bit. First of all, the plot and dialogue was very intelligent and I really like that about it. I'm not surprised that script won an academy award; it certainly deserved it. The casting was also very good. Nicholson and Dunaway had a unusual but strong chemistry and the supported cast helped build a believable world around them. Again, as far as considering it a film noir, much of the film didn't feel like one. It had the fairly typical detective plot but so much of the film was shot in bright, outdoor scenes. My major problem with the film was the ending. In a largely objective way, it was okay. I did fit certain themes of the film and brought an odd sort of closure to the plot.

1250378,5,B000022TSH,"Finally; a crime noir that works.  After watching quite a few lackluster film noirs I decided to revisit `Chinatown' to see if it still held up as the greatest film noir of all time and, quite honestly, it does.  Polanski gets everything right with this one, creating a film that is stunning, captivating, dark and brooding while always maintaining a level of hope that helps glue the audience to their seats (even if that hope is crushed in the devastating finale).  There are few films that have been able to capture this aura, the most recent being `L.A. Confidential'.

The crime noir is something difficult to master, but Polanski masters is effortlessly.

`Chinatown' revolves around private detective Jake Gittes who is hired by a woman claiming to be a jilted wife to follow her husband and see if he is indeed having an affair.  When the husband turns up dead and she winds up not actually being the man's wife things start to get complicated.  The man's real wife, Evelyn, shows up asking what business Jake had with her husband, and as Jake digs deeper into her husband's murder he uncovers the dirty secrets lurking around every corner.  As `Chinatown' spirals to a close and more is revealed it shifts from a pacifiable crime noir into a certifiable classic.

The script is brilliantly crafted, allowing the audience to sink into the grit of the situation with ease, building slowing on its foundation until the dramatic and explosive conclusion.  Much must be accredited to Polanski who just pulls from all angles and draws the audience in with each and every frame.  The murky, gritty feel to the film elevates the material and makes the audience feel a part of the action, and Polanski's resulting vision is one of beautiful demise.

A great facet of this film is the marvelous performances by the entire cast, most notably Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson is a brilliant actor, I think we all can agree there, but there are times when he falls into self mimicry and winds up just parodying himself in his films.  `Chinatown' is one of those times when he steps away from his public persona and just delivers a well rounded and fantastically crafted character.  J.J. `Jake' Gittes is one of Jack's greatest cinematic accomplishments and certainly one of his greatest performances.  Jack is given some ample help though, in the form of Faye Dunaway and John Huston, both of whom bring so much to this film.  Dunaway is dynamite here, really stakeing her claim as Nicholson's equal, and as the film draws to a close and her character is finally fleshed out to the full she emotes so much genuine emotion she helps that transition work.  Huston is delicious here, seriously.  His performance is what the movies is all about.  I'm really shocked he was passed over of the Oscar nomination when in all actuality I would have handed him the win.  He has the perfect mixture of parental protection and selfish indulgence to make his character not only believable but engrossing.

`Chinatown' is filled to the brim with enough of everything to keep the audience glued in anticipation.  The script is marvelous, tightly woven and intricate, always keeping you guessing and wanting more.  The acting is superb, truly elevating each and every scene and the mood set is pitch-perfect, and it never wanes.  Polanski should be lauded for this masterpiece.  It's a shame it was released the same year as Coppola's `The Godfather, Part II' for both films are brilliant, perfect even, but there is no topping the magnificence that is Coppola.",1219363200,2,3535,4.840266222961731

This film starts as a relatively simple detective story about a philandering husband but slowly the layers of the onion are peeled back and the web of intrigue becomes more complex and seedy.  Ultimately, you can see that the story is headed for a train wreck, it is simply a question of how it will unfold.  Jack Nicholson plays the shady detective who is digging for the truth about a murder and shady land dealings during a drought in 1930s Los Angeles.  In the end, it is hard to feel very sympathetic for any of the characters, most are driven by lust or greed or demons that they cannot purge.  There are literally hundreds of reviews of this film, there is no need for me to repeat plot summaries other than to say that I wholeheartedly support the most positive reviews.  This film is really a throwback to the great noir era of the 40s.  Jack Nicholson would have been great alongside Barbara Stanwyck and any of the other femme fatales of the noir era.  This film is in fact better than many of the earlier noir films in some ways in that more complex (and offensive) plot lines (e.g. incest) can be explored to really make the characters miserable and pathetic.

Certainly the pace picked up quite a bit in the last 3rd of the movie - which left me all the more frustrated with that sudden dud ending.  On the other hand, if Polanski's goal was to be true to noir genre, than perhaps he succeeded there (I wouldn't really know, not being an expert in noir).  As for the quality of the dvd, the transfer on my disc was rich and colorful - the tone of the film was certainly something of an acheivement.

I am now glad that I have seen this film, considering it is so highly regarded, but to say that this is the second greatest mystery movie of all time, and a better movie than ""Rear Window"", ""Laura"" and ""Blue Velvet"" (three of my favourite movies), is giving it far more credit than it deserves.

""Chinatown"" starts off as your standard private detective film. Private investigator Jake Gittens (Jack Nicholson) is hired by a woman, claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray, to find out if her husband is cheating on her. What seems to be routine divorce work becomes more complicated when the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) shows up and her husband is found murdered. Gittens investigates and discovers an illegal money-making plot (which I won't give the details of, in order to avoid spoilers) and then something far more sinister.

Although both Nicholson and Dunaway are excellent actors (although, I believe that both have made better films), this film is let down by what I consider to be a second-rate script (an opinion which I will, no doubt, be criticized for, since it won Best Screenplay). Here is why I do not like this script: firstly, the film is called ""Chinatown"", but none of the characters actually go to Chinatown until about five minutes before the end of the film (and because of this, the final lines of the film just don't seem justified); secondly, the villain barely appears, which makes the revelation of his guilt completely unsatisfactory; but my biggest criticism of the film is that, to me, it felt like the writer had started writing one film, a murder mystery about drought-ridden LA, but three-quarters of the way through, lost interest in that and decided to write a completely different film instead. This leads to the final act of the film feeling hurried and crowded. I also found the ending, in general, to be unsatisfactory, for reasons that will become apparent if you see the film.

The AFI did a pretty good job in compiling their Top 10 Mysteries list, but as far as I'm concerned, ""Chinatown"" is the joker in the pack. I highly recommend that all mystery lovers watch the movies on this list (the movies are, in order: ""Vertigo"", ""Chinatown"", ""Rear Window"", ""Laura"", ""The Third Man"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Dial M for Murder"" and ""The Usual Suspects""), but perhaps save ""Chinatown"" until last.",1215561600,6,2631,4.727668845315904
1250385,4,B000022TSH,"It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night. Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""

Robert Towne's screenplay owes a great deal to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, both expert writers of crime detective fiction full of sardonic humor and double entendre remarks, usually delivered in deadpan manner by whomever was playing the male detective. He uses ""Chinatown"" as a metaphor for a puzzle nobody can solve, sort of the way Thomas Mitchell summed up a mystery by saying ""makes as much sense as Chinese music"" in ""The Dark Mirror.""

In both CHINATOWN and THE MALTESE FALCON, a private eye gets involved in a messy case involving murder and other assorted mayhem, drawn into the case by a cool femme fatale who knows more than she's saying, and a cast of mostly unsavory characters living in the fringes of L.A.'s Chinatown area where crime in the 1930s is rampant.

In this case, the cynical, hard-nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination. And likewise, the inscrutable dame is played by FAYE DUNAWAY in the sort of part Mary Astor essayed in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Instead of Sydney Greenstreet, we get JOHN HUSTON in the role of her megalomaniac, corrupt father. And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.

It's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles. Visually, it's a masterpiece--and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.

A stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir. But somehow, Bogie's image hovers over most of the dialog and it falls far short of being called a ""masterpiece"" as many have done here. A more concise, compact telling of the tale would have made that description more apt instead of this long, rambling story with its engineering background and slow revelations.

Note: The widescreen DVD features a couple of insightful commentaries by the creators of ""Chinatown"" (Roman Polanski, Robert Towne, Bob Evans), as well as Jack Nicholson, but it's advisable to watch after seeing the film because a lot of the plot twists are given away.",1214784000,6,3018,4.954545454545454

This is 70s nihilism at its best.  Roman Polanski shows us why he's worthy of being regarded as a great director no matter how much sub-standard product he turns out, and Nicholson shines in his physical prime.  Robert Townes demonstrates why he is regarded as a superlative screenwriter, although it is important to note that Polanski is responsible for the film's devastating conclusion.

Gittes operates in a world where it is essentially impossible to do good.  No matter how much he seems to be in command of a situation, there are always factors beyond his understanding and control that fundamentally alter the intended outcome of all his efforts.  Knowing this, is he a fool or a hero for acting as he does?  Or perhaps he is just a decent human being who tries to help when he can, trusting to the Fates that he will not cause too much harm.  For much of this film, you may wonder why it is called ""Chinatown,"" but when the final scene reveals the suitability of the title, it is a disturbing comment on the human condition.",1206748800,,1269,4.710407239819005

Dunaway is beautiful and appropriately mysterious, strange,  and vulnerable, John Houston will give you the heebie geebies for a week with his charming presence that hides dreadful secrets.  The direction is masterful.  LA looks beautiful in the sun drenched light.

1250392,4,B000022TSH,"Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a private investigator. He solves all sorts of marital issues by providing suspecting wives or husbands with photographic proof that their loves ones aren't so loyal. When a high falooting dame struts into his office asking him to follow her wealthy husband around, he thinks nothing of it but the big paycheck it will bring him. Soon, though, he finds himself investigating a murder and some deeply seeded corruption among the leaders of the community. Complete with femme fatal, the real wife of the deceased (Faye Dunaway), this story mirrors the film noir genre of the 1940s and 50s.

The film starts out slowly but toward the end picks up rapidly for a startling and exciting finish. The use of 1930s decor is impressive; nothing seems to be used for the sake of art. Everything is seamlessly utilized by the actors so they appear to be living in the era, not merely participating in a costume film. Director Roman Polanski brings an exciting film movement into the modern era with use of violence and sex but none of it in excess. Viewers are not overwhelmed because no tactics are utilized without reason. Everything has its purpose; the deliberateness of the film makes it masterful.

Some might be put off by certain elements of this movie, especially those who prefer the class of classic Hollywood. This film spares no one and shows that even the most admirable characters have their demons.",1201305600,4,1434,4.848979591836735

1250395,5,B000022TSH,"""Chinatown"" is a fantastic private eye mystery thriller, filmed in 1974 and directed by Roman Polanski.  It is classic film nor in color.  It has dark and deep disturbing psychological drama with actors who are top notch - Jack Nicholson, John Huston, Faye Dunaway.  ""Chinatown"" has become a classic movie now, and is still spellbinding.  The setting is in the 1930's West and the illegal purchasing of water rights.  Many parts of the movie still ring true on the water wars and riches of the West.

Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes - a former cop, and now a run of the mill detective.  The movie starts with a standard request of a suspicious wife hiring a detective to follow her husband to see if he is having an affair.  He starts uncovering layers and layers of secrets  - like peeling an onion - layer after layer is there.  He reveals corruption, conspiracy, destructions, incest, murder and much, much more.  Jake has to constantly change his theories as each deception unfolds.  The hard facts are faced, and he continues on, even though he knows the dangers increase.  The movie amazed me as each disturbing part led to another.  I noticed Roman Polanski, who directed this movie, also played a bit part as a bad guy, and everyone Jake meets seems to be a bad guy in the end.

This movie deserves to be in the best top ten movies ever made.",1194912000,2,1351,4.570833333333334

There are nice documentary extras, but a commentary from Jack or Robert Towne would have been really sweet.  (A music only track for the great Jerry Goldsmith score wouldn't hurt either.)  The reason this film is so effective is that while it may pay homage to films past, nothing on screen references other pictures - certainly none of the performances.  People more familiar with Jack's more manic roles (which ones aren't?) may be surprised by how low-key yet dynamic he is here.  He's completely sensational, partly because his take on the 30s private detective is so original and distinctive.  And Faye Dunaway is the opposite of the femme fatale, hiding not her own dark character but her damaged, needy psyche.
The point of view is Jake's all the way through -- the camera's literally along for the ride.  But Polanski's gives two minute glimpses into Cross' and Evelyn's perspective when they're each at lunch with Gittes and the effect is startling.",1194739200,6,1029,4.913294797687861

The original DVD had a decent transfer and a featurette that included interviews with Robert Evans, Roman Polanski, and Robert Towne. While only running 12 minutes, it was a pretty good trip down memory lane. These new extras bring back all three men and Jack Nicholson for brand new interviews. This new disc also has an improved transfer that is a noticeable improvement over the previous edition.

""Chinatown: The Beginning and The End"" is a 20-minute retrospective look at the genesis of the film with Evans, Nicholson, Polanski and Towne talking about how they got involved with the project. Towne talks about several things that inspired his script and how his friendship with Nicholson informed the character of Gittes.

""Chinatown: Filming"" is a 25-minute examination of the principal photography. Polanski says that Evans gave him complete creative freedom. However, they clashed over the look of the film. Evans wanted it to look like The Godfather films while Polanski wanted it to resemble a Raymond Chandler detective novel. All four men recount some fascinating filming anecdotes.

""Chinatown: Legacy"" is a ten-minute look at how the film was initially received by test audiences. Polanski realized that the film's music had to be changed and Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to compose a score in only nine days! The studio felt that the film was ""too intellectual"" and the critics loved it. Chinatown went on to be nominated for 11 Academy Awards but only won one for Towne's screenplay.

1250398,5,B000022TSH,"Chinatown is probably one of the last great film noir movies. In my view, it's a tad overrated. The absolute best feature of the movie is the script. The complex nature of the plot, with its many twists and deceptions, is a modern classic. While the movie is long, and the characters come across as people with whom it's hard to sympathize (until it's too late), the storyline is such that you are compelled to see how it unravels.  So, if you're interested in an intelligent and very original story, Chinatown is a great choice. It's a very languid film, but with patience, the viewer is rewarded with a remarkable story.  There's an impressive line up of celebrated actors. Their performances aren't bad, but no tour de force at the end of the day.  5 stars for the script.",1193443200,4,775,4.561151079136691

1250401,5,B000022TSH,"A remarkable film noir classic, ""Chinatown"" finally gets the deluxe treatment it deserves on Blu-ray.

Blu-Ray: The Blu-ray looks quite nice. There is grain evident throughout but it isn't obstrusive staying true to the ""look"" of the original film and films of the time. Detail is quite nice throughout with my only complaint a bit heavy handed DNR on occasion in some scenes but that, again, could be justified if the grain was wildy inconsistent from shot to shot. The transfer walks the fine line of providing us with a sharp looking transfer that doesn't fall into the DNR pit of plastic skin and textures so smooth they rob the film of detail.

It appears that the print used for the previous DVD (and quite possibly the same transfer although I haven't been able to confirm this)was also the source for this edition of the film on Blu-ray. It's also possible this is an older HD transfer (again, I haven't been able to confirm when it was done) which might explain the look of the film for BD. either way, ""Chinatown"" looks quite good although purists might quibble with the amount of visibile grain and texture at times.

The audio is spectacular for the film.

As near as I can tell all of the extras from the previous special edition have largely been ported over which is good and bad--it would be nice to have some nice extras perhaps something looking at the film within the context of the original proposed trilogy a bit more or with hindsight in relation to the under rated sequel<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Two-Jakes-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000UAE7RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Two Jakes (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;which seemed to inherent the production trouble that was largely avoided on ""Chinatown"".

We get the audio commentary with writer Robert Towne being interviewed by film director David Fincher; the feature length documentary ""Water and Power"" about the inspiration for the film; a half hour documentary ""Chinatown: An Appreciation""; ""Chinatown: The Beginning"", ""Chinatown: The Filming"" and ""Chinatown: The Legacy all addressing the issues surrounding shooting, reception and where it stands in film history and as entertainment. We also get the original theatrical trailer and, although my edition is missing it, reportedly there is a booklet with stills and info on the film.

Bottom Line: Is this worth buying again? It depends on your TV and how good it displays high def and, more importantly, how important THIS film is to you. ""Chinatown"" has always been one of my Top 10 Films of all time so for me it was a no brainer.

DVD: The latest edition of ""Chinatown"" has much better contrast, a cleaner, richer looking transfer that more accurately captures a pristine theatrical presentation of the film. The anamorphic transfer has a bit more information on the sides than in the previous edition suggesting that it was cropped slightly differently (and I can't say which is truer to the original this edition or the previous one). Audio features the same 5.1 Dolby Digital mix that was a highlight of the first edition. We also get a cleaned up original mono soundtrack for purists. Both sound very good with the 5.1 featuring a nice dynamic mix.

1250402,5,B000022TSH,"Roman Polanski's finest work takes place in a prewar Los Angeles where everyone has a past they would just as soon keep hidden, where morality is fluid, to say the least, and where respectability is generally always fraudulent. It also happens to be the most interesting film ever made about water...although to the extent that it is really about anything, it mostly seems to be about secrets: the cost of keeping them, what happens once they're in the open, what happens when you try to find them out. As one might expect from the arthouse days of the 1970's, this movie is a bit more intellectual than your average movie, but that's hardly a strike against it. In fact, there have been few films quite as exciting and engaging as Chinatown ever to come out in Hollywood. It has a masterfully-constructed plot, clever-but-still-believable dialogue, virtuosic acting, editing, scoring--it's a rare kind of film that has everything working for it (Citizen Kane is another example) and it single-handedly revived film noir while adding countless new, imaginative touches (such as the infamous Jack Nicholson nose scene). Needless to say, it's a great film. The one question that remains is this:

What does a movie have to do to win a Best Picture Oscar, anyway?

Yes, Chinatown lost to The Godfather, Part II, which is another near-flawless film. Still, the creative staff could, at the time, have savored the fact that it had another parallel to Citizen Kane--both films only won Oscar honors for their screenplays. It's quite a profound drop we've seen in film since 1974--a year where three undeniably great films were nominated for Best Picture (GF II, Chinatown, and The Conversation). These days, it's usually unlikely that even a single Best Picture nominee will have any sort of staying power. It might be the way of things, but watching Chinatown is a way to see that they weren't always this way.

The setup of Chinatown [spoilers] involves a man by the name of Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private investigator who takes a simple job to investigate if a man (a very high-ranking city official) is cheating on his wife. After taking some photographic evidence of the affair (or so he thinks), the man's real wife (Faye Dunaway) comes forward to let Gittes know he's been duped. They try to figure out why Gittes was framed, and the case leads in a number of different directions, most of which involve Dunaway's wealthy, shady father (John Huston), before all the threads come together at the end of the film, which truly has to rank high on any list of the greatest film endings of all time. It's all wrong--not a single person deserves what they get, though it all seems like just a matter of inevitability. [/spoilers]

I'm gratified that we're finally getting a special edition of the film--the edition currently in existence is hardly outstanding. There seems to be little information available about the details as yet, but you owe it to yourself to purchase a copy. This is one of the greatest of all films--it's entertaining, enlightening, and emotionally resonant in a way that few works of art are--it's right up there with Greek tragedy.

""Chinatown's detractors say that the pacing is slow, but I find that it builds intensity as each piece of the puzzle is revealed and somehow doesn't fit or indicates that there is more to the puzzle.

As Dunaway's husband Hollis, he remains bespectacled & without dialogue for much of the picture until his character's tragic demise.

John Hillerman, who would play prominently on TV from 1980-1988 in ""Magnum P.I.,"" plays Yelburton, the assistant water commissioner.  Diane Ladd plays Ida Sessions, the fake Mrs. Mulray.

Compared to contemporary noir films such as L.A Confidential and classic noir films like the The Big Sleep, this movie is a little on the slow side and has less action, less violence and overall less suspense.  For a movie to be a fantasic noir film, I would also argue that it has to have great characters other than just the main lead- namely, it has to have a great femme fatale and great dialogue between that person and the lead.  Faye Dunaway was simply alright in this movie.  Compared to Lauren Bacall though, she just doesn't measure up.

Such is the case for Roman Polanski's 1974 film noir CHINATOWN. Robert Towne's brilliant script is the baseline for this fascinatnig story of the Los Angeles and environs of the 1930s, a time when power was wedded to corruption, greed, family secrets of aberrant stature, and manipulation of resources (here the Department of Water and Power, the police, and entrepreneurs).  Using the inimitable Jack Nicholson as the smart and daring private detective who pries open a conspiracy in the family of John Huston and his daughter Faye Dunaway whose private life secret is as huge as the water stealing crimes that are at the basis of the story was a stroke of genius that has rarely been matched since.  And tying all of this together with one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest musical scores and cinematography that is liquid and redolent of the wastes that were the at the core of Los Angeles' prostitution of sunlight and shadow - the desert by the sea - was part of Polanski's genius for direction.

For viewing an example of the finest in filmmaking, CHINATOWN remains at the top of the list. Grady Harp, December 06",1166486400,3,1440,4.91358024691358
1250421,5,B000022TSH,"Chinatown shows up in the Top Five all-time films of so many people, it's probably difficult to say what it is exactly that people find so wonderful about it. The absolute magnetism and deft performance of its emerging star, Jack Nicholson, is no doubt one of its stronger assets. While the story is brilliantly unique and quite interesting, it is not exciting, per se; it is dutifully structured in the detective genre, and aside from an occasional outburst of violence, is rather quiet and cerebral. Screenwriter and storyteller Robert Towne's scenes and dialogue are spare but sparkling, as is the cinematography and film editing.

Perhaps its greatest asset is its director, Roman Polanski who, with his art and set directors, magically re-creates Los Angeles as it was in the 30's. Whether staging scenes against bleached white adobe, a palm-lined street at twilight, or an office bathed in a venetian blind's shadows, Polanski gets a perfect, painterly shot in every frame.  He effortlessly guides all of his actors--lead and supporting alike--in subtle, but heartfelt performances.  This is one of those movies where the actors seem to believe that they themselves are in another time and place and that they are actually the characters they are portraying.  Add to all of this a moody, evocative score and its unforgettable love theme and suddenly the economical becomes expansive, filling the screen with dazzling movie-making at its best. The devastatingly powerful last scene is screen legend, rivalled, perhaps, only by Casablanca.",1162425600,7,1543,5.234817813765182

1250423,5,B000022TSH,"Some movies you just appreciate more with age.  What I mean is that there are movies you see when you're younger and you don't fully appreciate them or admire how well crafted they are.  This was the case with ""Chinatown"" for me.  I saw it many years ago for the first time, and while I enjoyed it somewhat, at the time I thought it was long, slow and dreadfully bleak at the end.  Of course, I didn't get the point that that's what ""Chinatown"" is supposed to be, and that's why it's brilliant.  I watched it recently for the second time, and I fell in love with it.  Absolute love.

A younger Jack Nicholson plays a private investigator, Jake Gittes.  Normally, he deals with cases that involve suspected adultery, so it's no surprise when a Mrs. Mulwray asks for his help.  What does surprise him is that she is married to Hollis Mulwray, a chief engineer of the water department.  What else is not up to par is the fact that the woman really wasn't Mrs. Mulwray, but somebody pretending to be her.  Curious, Jake goes deeper into the case to see what's really what, but it's not before long that Hollis ends up dead, and Jake has no idea what's the score or who it is he can trust.  This is just the basics of the movie.  What follows is a very complex plot filled with twists and turns that lead Jake to a place he thought he would never have to return to... Chinatown.

As I said before, the first time I saw this I thought it was an okay movie, mainly because I love Nicholson in it.  Now, I can watch the movie with older and wiser eyes and I can truly admire and appreciate the labor of love this film really is.  I didn't find myself bored with it at all, and in fact I could've watched another two hours if the story chose to go that far.  The reason for that is the cast and the writing really sells it.  It's not so much the plot that's the star of the picture, it's the characters and the people who play them.  Hell, the plot could've involved a simple pick-pocket and I would've still found myself captivated by it because you enjoy the trip the characters give you.  The film takes its time and doesn't rush.  It's not afraid of silence and it doesn't find itself having to go for silly non-stop car chases or shoot-outs to keep the viewer entertained.

While everybody is great in this movie, Nicholson really steals every scene, and the great thing is that he doesn't try to steal it.  He could stand still, just observing a quiet room and your eyes never leave him.  I don't think the movie would've worked if he wasn't the lead man in it.  Faye Dunaway also does a superb job, and you know she does because you really don't know how much you can trust her, and that's exactly what Nicholson's character goes through.  The DVD is pretty basic.  Other than a little retrospective with Roman Polanski, Robert Towne and Robert Evans, and a theatrical trailer, there aren't a lot of bells and whistles.  The picture looks good for it being so old.  I'm hoping that they'll release a special edition sometime in the near future, as this is an important film that deserves such a treatment.

""Chinatown"" is one of those movies that you find yourself appreciating more and more the older you get.  It's a classic, and it's easy to see why it is.  It's exciting without a high body count or loud and pointless chases (sure, there is violence and there are chases, but they are used very carefully and only for the right reasons).  The film reminds us that if you have the characters and the right actors, you could watch them for hours without yawning once.  I'm glad I took the trip again.  I would've missed out big time had I not decided to revisit ""Chinatown.""  Put this one on your list if you haven't seen it already.  Even if you don't end up loving it or liking it, it is something worth seeing at least once.  -Michael Crane",1156377600,8,3844,4.361971830985915
1250424,5,B000022TSH,"Oscar Winning director Roman Polanski's (Best Director, 'The Pianist') ""Chinatown,"" is a complete, undisputed masterpiece from the great director. The movie is number 19 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and won the 1974 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. I'm usually not a huge fan of AFI's picks (that's kind of a lie. Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Fargo, Unforgiven are some of my favorite films), but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. Three time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gittes, a private eye and former cop working in Los Angeles. Gittes is hired by a woman named Mrs. Mulwray to investigate whether her husband is having an affair. After investigating the man, who works really high up at the Water Company, he discovers that the man appears to be having an affair and the pictures end up in the newspaper.
At which point he meets Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), the real wife of Mr. Mulwray; Turns out someone posing as her hired Gittes. Shortly after, Mr. Mulwray dies; But Gittes is unsatisfied with the cause of death, being an ""accident."" As Gittes investigates further, he uncovers conspiracies, cover-ups, and several other plot twists that you still see echoes of in film 32 years later. That's right, this film is 32 years old. While watching it, I really did notice things (from dialogue to plot twists to plot line) that have been used in movies after this film. This movie is very influential. But it's also entertaining and genuinely surprising. Nicholson and Dunaway give some of their best performances and the dialogue is spectacular. Polanski is a very talented director when it comes to making audiences feel tension. Roger Ebert put it best ""The whole movie is a tour-de-force."" Which is very very true. This is one of the best films I've ever seen and any film buff should agree with me.
I can not urge you enough to see this movie.

1250427,4,B000022TSH,"No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already. I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on. It's not an easy to story to follow. It's also unusual: a crime story dealing with rights to water. To many people, that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California.

There is nothing confusing about how this DVD looks. It's a treat for one's eyes, especially if you love that 1940s look, which I do. This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere: a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail.

What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing: a man's nose getting sliced. Here, it's Jack Nicholson getting a ""nose job"" courtesy of some thugs. Jack, playing ""Jake Gittes,"" will forever be known (among wild roles) as the guy with a bandage on his nose, thanks to this movie. As interesting as he is, along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here.

1250429,5,B000022TSH,"Many people feel that ""Chinatown"" put Roman Polanski on the map as a directorial force to be reckoned with.  I feel that honor went to ""Rosemary's Baby"" six years earlier in 1968 and ""Chinatown"" solidified his force.

In any case, the movie's plot has been described numerous times on this page (and those folks can do a bit more justice to it than I) but a potential viewer needs to watch the movie to get the full force of Jack Nicholson's incredible acting, Faye Dunaway's conniving character, even Polanski's cameo as a wise-cracking gangster who cuts up Nicholson's nose pretty good.

And I'm usually not into DVD extras (interviews detailing every technical and creative aspect of the movie) but I was curious to know more about this masterpiece and was not disappointed in the least.  (Although, I admit, I became very uncomfortable watching Roman become uneasy mentioning Sharon Tate's name.  I wish he never had to go through that.)

1250430,5,B000022TSH,"""chinatown"" is a damn fine film.  it is among my favorite movies, but i'll qualify that a bit and say that it didn't really blow me away the first time.

it's strange to say, but for a film with an angular faye as femme fatale, a salty and zoot-suited nicholson, a convoluted plot design, virtuoso direction, some kinetic physical violence and a dash of sordid sexual tabbooed subject matter is actually a bit on the SUBTLE side.  something about the pacing and the washed out dull browns and pale yellows gives the film an uncharactoristic languid feel for a whodunit.

that said, i watched it a second time about a year or two later and it was a revelation.  i was thrilled at every line and twist and marvelled at the 1930s fantasy of the sets and outfits.  when approached with patience, ""chinatown"" is full of details, nuanced moments and dark existential energy.

this movie operates on many levels.  one obvious level is a modern homage to film noir, even using john huston as a primary charactor.  noir classics such as a private dick in over his head, a conspiracy that goes all the way to the top, a femme fatale, bad guys, angst...the whole kaboodle, you get the idea.

however at another level the noir is updated and given a more 70s type psychedelic sophistication and polanski's stamp of nihilistic absurdism. every charactor is given more nuance and breathing room then in typical treatments.  for instance, faye's evelyn becomes more fragile and less ""fatale"" with every scene she's in.  her beauty also takes on an odd charactor, as a friend pointed out to me, she almost starts to appear as grotesque by the end, and her final revelation to gittes (nicholson) is overwhelmingly grotesque, making the admission not nearly as surprising as it could be, because you are sensing the depth of her disaster long before it is brought in full light.

combined with the overall richness of the personalities and the constant snapiness of the dialogue is the unmistakable goofy and very dark touches of polanski.  i am a huge admirer of his, and he puts his mark fully in this picture, including of course his infamous cameo with the knife.  among my favorite ""polanski"" moments in the film are the many inept fighting sequences in which gittes is made to look like somewhat of a clown whose bark can not defend his bite. that gittes spends fifty percent of his screen time with a silly looking nose bandage adds to his folly.  additionallly the ending sequence in the street of chinatown polanski has several charactors who are hand-cuffed together limping in tandem vaudeville-style to see what the result of gun fire is.  i feel that this is classic polanski because we know that something horrible has happended, yet before we get confimation of this we are forced to see an obviously goofy lampoon.  the mix of the deadly serious and negative with a sharp and humorous bite is a very endearing and brilliant charactor of polanski's best work.  (see ""rosmary's baby"")

on a whole other larger layer this film seems to be about LA, and maybe about america generally and maybe about humans generally.  i don't know if it's so heavy-handed as all that, but nonetheless it does come very close to the true story of the double dealing involved in the origins of america's prototypical sprawl, the san fernando valley.  ""chinatown"" seems to hint not subtly at what lies inside of american utopianism.  an idea seemingly displayed in chinatown is this - ""someone with power and money writes the book, then everybody goes along with it, believing it is bible.  then someone some time later rewrites the book for personal gain.  then, since no one can really remember what the book was supposed to say in the first place takes the rewritten book as the original.""  whistleblowers in this process, such as our private dick jake gittes protagonist, are squashed immediately and treated to a buffet of nasty humanity in the process.

it's a film noir staple that is given a new level of cynical desperation.  but because the whole miasma is wrapped in a thoroughly stylish and entertaining package i didn't feel bummed out or turned off by the downbeat vibes and outcomes.

The story starts with private investigator Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) being hired by a concerned wife to see if her husband, Hollis Mulwray, a chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water Department is having an affair.  After several days of non-stop detective work, Gittes finds out that Mulwray is involved in a controversial water supply project.  Finally, the surveillance pays off with Gittes photographing Mulwray with a woman in a compromising position.  Mulwray later turns up dead from an apparent drowning, but soon after Gittes finds out a lot things just aren't what they seem including the death of Mulwray, the politics surrounding the local water project, and motive for the initial detective work monitoring Mulwray.  This sets up the reminder of the film where Gittes deals with plenty of powerful, corrupt and dangerous people to find out what really happened to Mulwray and why.

The color widescreen presentation is a visual feast for the eyes from start to finish.  The story takes place in 1930's Los Angeles and even for being released in 1974, the attention to detail for making it seem true to that era is utterly amazing.  But the film is still more than a powerful retro-noir movie.  The acting by the three main characters: Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston is magnificent.  Nicholson's role is one that it seems like we seen dozens of times - an urban detective getting sucked into more then he bargained for and getting roughed up and used as a patsy, but Nicholson does it better than anyone before or since.  The screenplay also works brilliantly as every scene is fascinating and rarely predictable.  The ending does get a little weird and even provokes some controversy as it goes into a taboo subject, but what else could one expect from a film directed by Roman Polanski.  Chinatown is a must-see movie for anyone who appreciates beautifully filmed, well acted pictures.  This DVD is an essential addition to any serious film enthusiast's library.  I've seen this movie at least 5 times, twice on DVD, and it never gets old!

As for the DVD itself, the 16x9 widescreen presentation is overall excellent but not quite perfect as occasional micro-spots of film deterioration could be observed once in a while.  The picture seemed adequately sharp, but did not seem to razor sharp as some other releases I've seen from that era.  The stereo sound is also top-notch.  The only bonuses are a trailer and a brief interview with the three main people behind the film: writer Robert Towne, producer Robert Evans and director Roman Polanski who is currently exiled from America for having sex with a minor in the late '70's.

Nicholson's Gittes character is fantastic - sure he plays the tough hard boiled PI but when it boils down to it - he is caught in a game far far greater than he can understand and the reality of the stakes involved only dawn on him at the very end. John Huston gives a lesson in how to be evil - that is you never show it on the surface.

The filming of the ending scene which everyone always says is so great is all jumbly and amateur looking.

I never really got to form an attachment to any of the main characters, they seemed more like modern actors self-consciously trying to embody certain film noir types.

Jack Nicholson is the protagonist.  Faye Dunaway is the leading lady.  The odd thing is, my favorite actor here is John Huston, the villain, who doesn't get nearly as much screen time as the other two.  He is perfectly believable in a very eerie role.  He is charming, menacing, and nuts, all at the same time.

This movie benefited greatly by having a non-American director, Roman Polanski.  America, this one time, is shown to be a land where wealth rules, where the good guys completely lose, the innocent are victimized, and the cops aren't getting anything right.  It is a mirror of ourselves that only a non-American would have given us.

I would say a lot more, but I realize that some of you who are browsing this site haven't seen the movie yet, and it would be a crime to reveal too much.  This is an extremely intelligent film with some hard hitting surprises.

It does not focus on Chinatown.  Chinatown is just mentioned as a place where some of the characters used to work, a place ruled by organized crime, where the best thing for the cops to do was as little as possible, because they never knew whether they were being used to solve a problem for the innocent or being used as pawns by the guilty, to add the weight of law to the weight of extortion.

I know exactly how that is, how police can be used in America to further the goals of the guilty parties.  Chinatown, in this movie, is a symbol of lawlessness and disorder, and the movie is telling us that all of America is like that, that we live in Chinatown ourselves, that there is no law here.  Sometimes it does go that way.

I've never seen an ending as menacing as the ending in this movie.  Actually, do you remember in Saturday Nite Live when they did the ""Bill"" skits, where the victim kept saying ""Oh noooooooooo....."".  Hey, when things get this bad, it helps to laugh.",1119139200,,1994,4.476454293628809

Jack Nicholson gives his best performance as the detective who is anything but a hero.  Faye Dunaway is perfect as the not so clean damsel in distress.  But John Huston, in one of his rare acting role, steals the show as the amoral industrialist.

Over the years some more recent films, such as LA Confidential and Mulholland Falls, sought to redevelop the same themes.  Both, in my view, failed to live up to the high standards established in Chinatown.  Chinatown begins with an interesting plot :  the woman who had arrived in his private detective office turned out to be someone other than the person he thought.  The original woman had wanted to spy on her husband to see if he was cheating.  The actual woman had never met the character played by Jack Nicholson.  From this twist early in the movie, all other events follow:  Nicholson uncovers a plot by the Department of Water and Power to divert water stream flows to an area in the  Valley, whose developer is intending to reap extra profits from purchasing the land, quite cheaply, and being able to sell at a profit once knowledge of the irrigation supply that will be provided to the Valley will be made public.",1118361600,,1015,4.787356321839081

Everything works perfectly here - the storyline, the intrigues, even the mystique of Chinatown which figures prominently in Jake's past. Roman Polanski directed and does so with great care and attention to details. Nicholson is riveting throughout, even with that bandage on his nose most of the movie.

I love the mysteries throughout which you are constantly trying to sleuth along side the main character(s). My favorites, however, are the ones that take you in circles. I want plot twists. I want to be led in directions that end up being dead ends. I want to be left surprised at the ending, admitting that I never saw it coming.

Though I was not surprised at the ending of Chinatown, there certainly were plenty of twists in the plot. A longer movie, at more than 2 hours, that never dragged; Chinatown did not disappoint.

The movie was also extremely aesthetically pleasing. No, I am not referring to Faye Dunaway...entirely. The style chosen for the film was using muted colors and accenting a few greens, blues, yellows and pinks. The stark contrast between the dull scenes and strategically placed vivid colors was great.

It looks like someone took an aging, washed-out copy, upped the color saturation, and called it remastered.

Chinatown is arguably the greatest movie ever made. But to understand this, and thus to understand why you really should watch it, it is perhaps useful to understand where it fits. Chinatown is certainly not the most ""important"" film, as it is essentially a rehashing of the film noir genre, but it terms of absolute and unequivocal success as BOTH a work of art and entertainment, Chinatown is without rival.

Chinatown does such a fantastic job of capturing the mood and feel of the pre-World War II era that it actually seems like the film had to have been made back then. You may think it's a bit slow in the beginning, but rest assured that every little detail is significant to the story, which ultimately builds to an unforgettable climax. This critically acclaimed film is deserving of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it.

1250476,5,B000022TSH,"The title of this movie does not refer to the story's setting, at least not until the very end. Rather it is a metaphor for a complex and confusing place that is best left alone lest one ends up getting hurt. It's hard to imagine a better period crime drama than ""Chinatown"". In what remains his career-best film (in spite of his recent and amazingly first Oscar win for ""The Pianist""), Roman Polanski made a neo-noir masterpiece in 1974 full of elaborate plot twists, morally ambiguous characters and moody, authentic-feeling atmosphere. This movie is not a tribute to film noir as has been concluded by casual viewers, it's a complete reinvention of that genre into a more complex mindset thanks to Robert Towne's superbly written script.

Having just completed the crudely funny ""The Last Detail"" and going next to his Oscar-winning ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson was on a career-high roll when he played Jake Gittes, a struggling private eye in 1937 Los Angeles. Even in the midst of such an accolade-laden career, this is my favorite of his performances probably because he plays the role so against expectation. Bogart has so clearly etched the world-weary, dame-slapping gumshoe in our collective memories that Nicholson decided to take a less obvious approach here. He plays the detective as a relatively decent guy, who treats his often unsavory job as an honorable profession, even if he has to grub around to serve his clients. In walks Evelyn Mulwray, a mysterious woman with many secrets, who also happens to be the wife of the LA County water commissioner. But is it the real Mrs. Mulwray? What seems like a straightforward adultery case becomes much more as Gittes gets involved with the then-scandalous San Fernando land buying conspiracy, corruption around water politics and of course, murder.

In what has to be her career-best performance as well, Faye Dunaway is picture-perfect as Evelyn with her pencil eyebrows, iron-shingled coiffure and cool aura of heightened glamour and deceit. The surprising element to her character is that she looks so right as a femme fatale, and yet she exposes herself as a much more complex person full of emotional scars and trembling self-denial. As her backstory is divulged to both Gittes and the viewer, it becomes clear that her sophisticated veneer has shattered into a desperate scramble to escape her fate and exposes the purest of motives. It's a memorable transformation. In fact, the real core of evil in the story emanates from her father, Noah Cross, a charmer who hides a deeply disturbing soul. Polanski chose director John Huston to play Cross, and it's an inspired choice as he, of course, directed several classics of the same ilk - ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Key Largo"", ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". This in-depth understanding of the genre allows Huston to imbue Cross with the right spirit, enabling him to essay the part perfectly - a thoroughly amoral individual whose apparent good nature can't conceal the stench of corruption that clings to him.

The main plotline has Cross and some others planning an elaborate scam to dry up the San Fernando valley by diverting water away from it, then buying up the land cheaply, then re-diverting the water back to the valley, so the property becomes fertile and the price skyrockets. Evelyn's husband has the misfortune to figure out what's going on, and now Jake, following the dead man's trail, comes to the same conclusions. A young girl enters the picture, originally thought to be Cross' mistress, but her identity is far more convoluted. Of course, the disclosure of her identity becomes the point of one of cinema's most unforgettable confrontation scenes between Jake and Evelyn. At the end of the film, Gittes stands by helpless as the woman he has tried to save dies violently despite his best efforts because there are no sure things in the world of ""Chinatown"" and certainly no predictable endings. All the period flavor is impeccable from John A. Alonzo's burnished gold-and-brown-hued cinematography to Jerry Goldsmith's moody, insinuating musical score to W. Stewart Campbell's spot-on art direction. A monumental achievement strongly recommended.",1102118400,5,4204,5.063492063492063

Just when you thought you're going to leave the theater with a smile on your face, your not. This has to be one of the most memorable extended endings in the movie history together with Seven and Casablanca to name a few.

The performances are all phenomenal. Jack Nicholson gave the performance of his career. He gets to exhibit a range of emotions combining subtlety and intensity. Faye Dunaway has the perfect mystique to capture the character and she made it really touching and compelling especially towards the end of the movie. John Huston has the creepy evil vibe that's both disgusting and freaky.

But the real star of the movie is the screenplay of Robert Towne. This is the best screenplay in movie history. Period. Overflowing with style but not in any way pretentious, compelling and deeply moving without being sentimental, mind-boggling without being contrived, and memorable scenes all through the movie. Perfection. But of course huge credit should be given to Roman Polanski who combine all this film making aspects and turn into a masterpiece unparalleled in it's genre up to this time.

The DVD is a little disappointing, totally disrespected the film. A commentary would suffice but I guess we have to wait because this film is so much good it deserves better treatment in DVD. As little as possible shouldn't apply here!

It is, and is also in fact the example of how important good writing is in the art of cinema. It is perfection and in the hands of Roman Polanski it became a film masterpiece.

Robert Towne has taken the true story of how Los Angeles stole water to grow and wound around it the fictional story of Jake Gittes, Evelyn Mulwray, and Noah Cross and made them major participants in an ugly little tale of lust and greed.  Towne's screenplay is layered like a decaying Dahlia with twisting mysteries and taught suspense. There is not a loose end in sight and a few well placed red herrings are added to the mix to delight any fan of this type of story.
  The attention to detail from vintage cars, sets, real L.A. streets and alleys to the excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith and the golden cinematography of John A. Alonzo contribute to all the aspects of this classic of the post 60's film noir.
  Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray is at the top of her game creating a neurotic exotic hothouse flower that carries death within the heart of her dark and dirty secret.  Lacquered and veiled in the most perfect black widow getup of the genre she is superbly brittle and vulnerable at the same time.  She is fascinating to watch as she slowly unravels along with the mystery until she is naked in the horror of what her past and present prison is. This is a great performance by a great artist.
  As Evelyn's father Noah Cross, John Huston is the debauched cancerous center of evil and greed captured within the crumbling casing of a seemingly charming old man. He too gives the performance of a lifetime and his soliloquy on what a man is capable of is chilling.
  The center of this masterwork is Jack Nicholson who became a star with this, the best of his early work. His J. J. Gittes is hardboiled and ruthless in getting to the bottom of why he is being used to take the fall for a murder. He embodies the soul of Bogart and the heart of a romantic fighting to stay tuff in a rotten world. He is drawn with such skill that he seems not to be acting but simply existing the real world of L.A. in the late 1930's.
  ""Chinatown"" is seminal in its place in film history. It bridged and old and forgotten genre with a new Hollywood in its post studio infancy and laid the groundwork for later films of equal ambition such as ""Mullholland Falls"" and  ""L.A. Confidential"".
  This is one of the best film ever made and a must have for any serious film collector.",1089331200,13,2575,4.423728813559322
1250487,5,B000022TSH,"Not since Otto Preminger's LAURA had filmgoers the pleasure of watching a classic film noir, until Polanski's CHINATOWN. The plot and characters are complex but chillingly believeable. I can't find anything wrong with this film. It is well-paced for a fairly long movie. The lighting, cinematography, setting, costumes... everything is as should be. The performances by John Huston and Faye Dunaway are eerie and tragic, respectively. Then of course there's Nicholson. Mad Jack was already firmly established on the Hollywood map having already won acclaim for EASY RIDER, THE LAST DETAIL, and FIVE EASY PIECES. This film however fixed him permanently in the constellation of Hollywood stars. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST would soon follow. In any event, his portrayal of an aloof, world-weary gumshoe who stumbles in over his head into an intrigue involving crooked politicians and the money-slobbering wealthy still holds up 30 years later. This is an incredible film.",1086825600,,973,5.366013071895424
1250497,5,B000022TSH,"The mid-1970s saw a spate of ""government conspiracy"" films, all with liberal themes that emanated from Watergate. None of them were about Kennedy stealing the 1960 election. Hmm.
""Chinatown"" (1974) may be the best screenplay ever written. A historical look at 1930s Los Angeles, it actually condensed events from the 1900s with events that, uh, never happened but made for good drama. Written by L.A. native Robert Towne, directed by Roman Polanski, produced by Evans and starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunnaway and famed director John Huston, it told the story of how Los Angeles became a metropolis. In Towne's version, Huston ""owns"" the L.A. Department of Water & Power with a character based on actual L.A. City engineer William Mulholland. Mulholland had orchestrated the political deal which built the aqueduct that brought water from the Owens Valley into the L.A. Basin, allowing millions of Southern Californians to keep their lawns green to this day.
The Mulholland character is ""sacrificed"" at the altar of greed, embodied by Huston, who secretly buys the San Fernando Valley, knowing that once the water deal is set, it will be incorporated into the city, making him a gazillionaire. It is rather cynical, although nobody suggests the L.A. ""city fathers"" were boy scouts. The same old theme is that capitalism and American political power are corrupt. To make sure the audience is convinced the corruption is beyond redemption, Huston is in the end found out be an insatiable, incestual monster. He plays the role so well it brings up minds-eye imagery of his real daughter, Angelica. The film is utterly beyond any criticism, regardless of political colorization. For decades, film students and screenwriters have studied it. It spawned an artistic quest to lace the screen with symbols, metaphors, backstory, and twists.
""Chinatown"" seems to be the apex of the American film period, the mid-1970s. The period from 1960 to 1979 is unparalleled, but the backstory of the people who created these classics is a telling tale of why the genre leans to the Left. In the 1960s, film schools became popular. Four schools emerged, and have held their place as the place to learn the craft. In Los Angeles there was the USC School of Cinema-Television. Their first big alumnus was ""Star Wars"" director George Lucas. UCLA combined their film school with their drama program, so as to bring actors, writers, directors and producers together. Coppola went to UCLA along with a future rock star named Jim Morrison, who would form The Doors with another UCLA film alumnus, keyboardist Ray Manzarek.

It is MY personal favorite film of all time and was judged one of the top 25 best films of all time by the American Film Institute for very good reasons.  First of all, the script is brilliant.  This film was MADE to be owned, since on first viewing the spectator won't realize that EVERYTHING in the film, down to the pictures on the walls and seemingly off-handed remarks by the characters are PART of the story. In  one line from the film, Noah Cross says "".... you may THINK you know what you are dealing with, Mr. Gittes, but believe me, you don't"" and that statement could not be more ""on target""....  This movie gives the viewer clue after clue along the way.... but one should NEVER rewind or go back until the entire movie is viewed.... but absolutely play it a second time a week or so later... and suddenly you find the clues, the lies and the deception stands out in bold relief.  I have seen Chinatown at least 25 times over the years... and it still fascinates me.  Nicholson deserved the Oscar for this film. Dunaway was sultry and marvelous. John Huston was absolutely convincing as Noah Cross, the man with unlimited power and even Diane Ladd, in a minor role as ""Ida Sessions""... a small time ""working girl"" was perfection.  The DVD transfer is not perfect... I would say it is a 9 on a scale of 10, some fuzz here and there and some background noise in the quieter parts... but overall it looks clear, color corrected and clean. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, although composed in a week, is probably his best score.  THIS FILM IS NOW 30 years old and we deserve a 2 disc boxed set with the COMPLETE score (the CD soundtrack only has about 35 minutes of SOME of the cues) and we deserve some still frames, some information about WHERE the scenes were filmed and so forth.  ON the Criterion release on Laserdisc several years ago, you could see the entire film with ONLY the music score (L.A. Confidential has that feature on DVD)... this one would be terrific to watch that way.

One gets the feeling while watching this film that it's patterned on maybe a Raymond Chandler/Sam Spade book. It's all about incest, infidelity, politics, treachery, lying, secrets - and no one who has seen it is likely to forget the scene in which Polanski himself appears for a brief and memorable sleazy cameo performance as a slimy scumball in cinema's best tradition.

1250516,5,B000022TSH,"With all the Oscar hoopla this past year around director Roman Polanski's sprawling, if flawed ""The Pianist,"" one would think that it's the only Polanski movie out there. Well, if you've seen ""The Pianist,"" you've seen a Holocaust movie like the rest of 'em. Take a trip back to Polanski's 1974 movie ""Chinatown"" and forget all you know.
  Who knew a movie about a water conspiracy would be so nail-bitingly intriguing, and who'd a thought that screenwriter Robert Towne could take an old, dying genre (the ""gumshoe"" movie) and turn it into arguably the best screenplay this side of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""All About Eve""? It's all here, with Jack Nicholson as smooth private eye Jake Gittes, and Faye Dunaway as the cryptic Evelyn Mulwray. Look closely, though. As ""Chinatown"" unfolds, it looks like it's going to be the typical detective movie, but twists and turns in the film's complicated narrative turn a simple San Fransisco water conspiracy into a twisted, perverse, nightmare that reeks of the Electra complex.
  Yes, ""The Maltese Falcon"" has the style that set a trend, and ""The Big Sleep"" juggles plot strands like a sideshow freak, but ""Chinatown"" adds a tragic depth to its narrative that was never seen in such a movie and has never been seen since. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are no Nick and Nora Charles - there's a deep secret lying beneath it all that makes the movie a haunting and unforgettable experience. Dunaway hides the film's tragedy well, revealing it in an infamous scene that proves this is the finest work she's ever done. And Nicholson. Drawn slowly into a twisted web of corruption and deceit, he seems almost too smart for it, but Towne's script proves that there is a heart beneath his inquisitive glare, and it, along with all of ours, is broken in the film's devastating finale.
  If you're into gumshoe flicks, this is the best one out there, but it also stands as one of the finest American films of all time. Just look at the film's ending - though ""American,"" it carries a tragic, ""European"" touch that was no doubt a product of the painful history of Polanski. In a way, this movie relays the torture and pain of his Holocaust experience in a better fashion than ""The Pianist."" Even without digging into director's intentions, the final product of the movie is haunting, tragic, and won't get out of your head for days. One of the great lines of the film is ""Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.""

The music for the opening credits couldn't be more perfect, capturing the big band sound of the thirties but hinting at a deep and painful weariness that goes to the heart of the film.  This is a film of beautiful surfaces where evil suddenly appears and shocks like maggots swarming the pit of the perfect peach.
Jack Nicholson makes J.J. Gittes sleazy, angry and desperate whose quest for truth is both foolish and noble.  Fay Dunaway displays a fragile strength and desperate pain as Evelyn Mulray that she doles out beautifully over the course of the film.  John Huston uses his oily warmth to great creepy effect.
And then there is the screenplay; beautifully constructed, wonderfully original with dialog that is both memorable and natural.  Is there a better original screenplay in Hollywood history?

1250521,5,B000022TSH,"Watching Chinatown again recently, it struck me that it is just about perfect.  All the elements of film-making were performed here at an extraordinarily high level, and the result is one of the most satisfying movies ever made. Much imitated, rarely equalled, Chinatown is THE standard against which period mysteries must be measured.
Start with the wonderful script by Robert Towne that borrows from and re-imagines LA history without straying too far from the facts.  A  convoluted story of local political machinations is also the setting for a murder mystery set amid family secrets and betrayals.  His plot, characters and dialogue entertain and intrigue us and the film's brilliant central metaphor, Chinatown, reveals, conceals and resonates long after the credits roll.  Great stuff.

Next, people the story with a terrific cast led by a sauve and cynical Jack Nicholson as PI Jake Gittes, who despite his worldliness is in way-over-his-head without knowing it, Faye Dunaway as the fragile femme fatale, Evelyn Mulwray, and John Huston as one of the most memorable villains in moviedom as the rich & powerful, ruthless yet seemingly benign, Noah Cross.  The supporting players are equally well-cast.
Then put this story and cast in the hands of a brilliant director with an equally gifted cinematographer, and turn them loose.  Roman Polanski was an inspired choice to direct this film, not only because (as mentioned in the retrospective on the DVD) he brought a European sensiblity to this very American story of political & economic intrigue but also because as he had demonstrated in his earlier works (Knife in the Water, Repulsion, etc.) Polanski is adept at creating tension and dread on film.  Chinatown's great success is in the atmosphere and tension and ominous feel of foreboding that overlays the film. We, like Jake, don't know where we are going or how these disparate threads of story tie together, but we sense it is dangerous to follow them and that something, unrevealed, is just beyond our grasp. Chinatown succeeds because its mystery is actually mysterious, its story complex, its secrets genuinely surprising.
Finally, art direction, costuming and period detail in Chinatown is beautiful and meticulous.  And the music score is so good that it has been imitated many times in Chinatown wannabes.
There have been many attempts to emulate the quality of Chinatown, a few successfully (LA Confidential), many poorly (Mulholland Falls).  Chinatown is about as good as Hollywood can do, meeting both the obligations of entertainment while uniting and presenting the various craftsmanship of film-making at such a high standard that it raises the result to the level of art.
This unique confluence of story and talent occurs rarely, but when it clicks, as it did so brilliantly in Chinatown, the result is the masterpiece we all recognized from its initial release.  A timeless and indispensible film that would be diminished by any change or subtraction of any piece of its construct, this one should not be missed. A great film",1058572800,2,3055,5.149494949494949
1250522,5,B000022TSH,"The film's title refers to an area of Los Angeles where private investigator J.J. Gittes (Nicholson) once served as a police officer. It also suggests the difficulties of finding one's way in unfamiliar territory. Directed by Roman Polanski who received (in absentia) an Academy Award in 2003 for his direction of The Pianist, this film seems to have multiple layers of meaning and apparent meaning. Yes, it is well within the noir tradition but it also seems to reflect so much of the social discord during the decade prior to when it was released (1974) even as it examines Los Angeles during the 1930s, amidst the Great Depression but also a time when so many accumulated vast wealth through sometimes questionable business practices. (If I recall correctly, the number of millionaires in the United States quintupled during the decade following the collapse of the stock market in 1929.) By all accounts, Noah Cross (Huston) is an immensely wealthy and power force within the city's business community. For reasons which are revealed in the film, Gittes finds himself in an adversarial relationship with Cross and has little chance of prevailing against him. Now a private investigator, Gittes is retained by Evelyn Mulwray to follow her husband Hollis whose behavior has raised questions and caused her to be concerned. Gittes' involvement with her leads to his conflicts with Cross, for reasons which neither Gittes nor we understand until much later in the film. Polanksi briefly appears in the film (an Hitchcockian touch) as the Man with a Knife...and he uses it. Throughout much of the movie, neither Gittes nor we know what's happening. Individuals as well as circumstances are not what they appear to be. It's as if Gittes and we are being toyed with...a brilliant strategy on Polanski's part to sustain interest with precise pacing while creating tensions and even conflicts whose nature evades understanding. At one point Cross tells Gittes ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't."" He didn't and, at that point, neither did I.
Obviously, this film intrigues me, in part because it frustrates me as I must struggle (as does Gittes) to understand various relationships which may be real or imagined...both by me and by most of those involved. What's with Evelyn Mulwray? What information is she concealing? To what extent (if any) is her husband Hollis involved with Cross? What is her own relationship with Cross? Whom and what does Gittes threaten? Why? (For most of the film, he doesn't know.) I could go on and on about ambiguities.

1250525,5,B000022TSH,"The success of THE PIANIST recalls Roman Polanski's glory days, when in just over a decade he turned out such stunning classics like KNIFE IN WATER, REPULSION, THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and this film, CHINATOWN.  One thing all these films have in common is the great difficulty the main character has in each film in discovering what is appearance and what is reality, perhaps in the end discovering that reality is an illusion.  CHINATOWN is a detective film that isn't.  In the usual detective film, the gumshoe follows a string of clues and in the end is able to assert order over chaos by ""solving"" the mystery.  In CHINATOWN, on the other hand, Jack Nicholson's J. J. Gittes solves the mystery only to uncover the incomprehensible and the unfathomable.  Instead of asserting the primacy of order over chaos, the chaos engulfs him, visually represented by the crowding of Asians around Gittes in the films' closing shot.  ""Chinatown,"" where the final shot takes place, becomes a metaphor for the inscrutable and opaque quality of life itself.
This is a meticulously made film, and it is susceptible to analysis at a very deep level.  For instance, it isn't accidental that at one point Faye Dunaway tells Nicholson, upon noticing a discoloration in her eye, that it is a flaw in the iris.  Later, that is the eye through which she is shot and killed.
The plot is very, very loosely based on the life of William Mulholland, who was responsible for building the viaduct that brought water to LA from Owens Valley.  That real life incident took place several decades earlier than the time in which CHINATOWN was set, but with the central role that water has played in the Los Angeles's, the incident was well chosen.  The part involving Faye Dunaway and her daughter had, thank god, no counterpart in Mulholland's life.
It is almost impossible to say of an actor like Jack Nicholson that one role is his finest, but one can at least state that his turn as Jake Gittes is one of his very finest performances.  His fortitude in the face of moral horror provides the foundation for the narrative, and his collapse upon looking into the heart of the void at the end of the film establishes precisely the right tone.  If we weren't ourselves horrified and crushed at the end, we would be merely by gazing into his stunned and bewildered face.  Similarly, Faye Dunaway was as good as she would ever be as Evelyn Mulray.  John Huston managed to create one of the vilest characters in the history of film, while Roman Polanski himself managed to be one of the scariest.  The scene where Polanski cuts Nicholson's nose is rightfully remembered as one of the most vivid in the movies.
Unfortunately, after this film Polanski's string of great films came to an end, those following in the next couple of decades ranging from decent to out and out awful.  Hopefully his resurrection with THE PIANIST will signal a return to form of one of the most interesting directors of the 1960s.",1053648000,2,2993,4.749034749034749
1250536,4,B000022TSH,"Since this classic has been reviewed by so many others, I thought I would focus more on the DVD itself.  It was released in 1999 to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the film but being new to the DVD world, I just purchased it recently.

1) The print is great and the sound crystal clear. Considering I only had a VHS copied from Cinemax over 10 years ago and the commerical ridden version on AMC to tide me over the last few years, it was wonderful to see the film in letterbox format. I originally saw this film in a giant, single screen grand theatre back in 1974, before the attack of the multi-plexes, and watching the DVD on a big-screen tv brought back those memories quickly. All I was missing was the wood-back, poorly cushioned seat.  So from that standpoint, the DVD gets 5 stars.
2) Scene selection - Unfortunately, the DVD falls short here. There are only 15 or so scene selections and when the average DVD contains about 2 dozen, I figure somewhere along the way,  cost was a factor. I know this is a nit-pick kind of thing but Chinatown is filled with snippets of great scenes and I can't always get to the points I want to without hitting the fast forward button in addition to the skip. I would think just about every ""fade to black"" occurence, and this movie contains many, could have been a selection.  Sorry, as a fan who enjoys just watching some of the classic lines/scenes (""....and I like breathing through it..."", ""...to tell you the truth, I lied a little...""), I feel shortchanged. Rate 2.5 stars.
3) There is an interview with the three biggest ""behind the scenes"" participants, producer Robert Evans, writer Robert Towne, and director Roman Polanski. Although there are a few tidbits of fun trivia(the name of the other actress the studio apparently wanted instead of Dunaway, Polanski pointing out an ""incorrect technicality"" of a scene where Gittes is snapping a picture) the interviews seemed short and fell a little short of my expectations. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of the documentary PBS did years ago about great mystery films. ""Chinatown"" was dissected and it was much more in depth. For example, something pointed out then that I never noticed and has made me appreciate the film even more over the years was how Polanski shot many scenes from behind Gittes, over his shoulder. The idea was to bring the viewer into the film almost as a character standing behind Gittes. We discover things as he does. The scene where Gittes discovers the body of Ida Sessions was discussed in great detail. To me, this is one of the ""little things"" that make this film a classic.  I imagine there must have been a good reason why none of the actors were part of the interviews.  I mean this film was rated number 19 on the AFI greatest films of all time list and you would think someone would appreciate that enough to participate. Dunaway once wrote about about how Nicholson was upset when shooting a scene interfered with him watching a Laker game.  I guess I wanted to hear that story verbally.  I know, nit-picking again but come on Paramount, dole out a few bucks to round some people up.  3 stars.
Bottom line, this film is still worth the purchase price no matter the shortcomings. After all, the film is what we watch over and over, not the extras. My hope is that with the 30th anniversary quickly approaching and DVD's being embraced by consumers much more now than in 1999, maybe we will get the background documentary and scene selection us ""Chinatown junkies"" may want to see.",1051747200,6,3541,4.615262321144674

Jack is right up there with Bogart, Powell, Mitchum or any other actor or actress who ever played a gumshoe.
The cast is great, the production is great, the music is great. This might have been the best film to be seen from director Roman Polanski and it might have been one of the best scripts from writer Robert Towne. (It has been said that this is part one of his trilogy. Well we've seen one which was great, two which was boring, will we ever see three?)
Chinatown has one of the best musical scores for film ever. That score by Jerry Goldsmith, dare I say it, runs neck and neck with the much exalted score for Lawrence of Arabia by Maurice Jarre. Chinatown's score like the one for Lawrence has precisely the right notes and precisely the right feel at precisely the right time. Often, enough one can say that a good score is understated and just there below the surface of the action, well this one goes hand in hand with the screen action yet doesn't get in the way at all. The prepared piano sounds are at once novel and intriguing. The harmonics played by the strings are just what are called for.
But sort of on the down side is some of the editing which at times can be really nasty. There are also some wooden deliveries but right after you encounter something like that you get to see a great scene from classic film, so you really can't lose!

1250543,5,B000022TSH,"This 1974 film takes the classic film noir detective movie to new heights.  Yes, there is murder, scandal and lots of lies.  But yet Jack Nicholson, cast as a private eye, is a sympathetic character.  There's one scene in which the director, Roman Polanski, playing a bit part as a thug, rips open Nicholson's nose with a knife.  This is the kind of wound that makes the audience grimace every time someone refers to it in the film.  Faye Dunaway is cast as the femme fatale.  She's beautiful, of course, and it's hard to take our eyes off of her.  She's a woman of mystery, but little by little we glimpse her humanity.  And by the time her secret is revealed, she's won everyone's heart.
Based on a real life scandal in Los Angeles in 1908, another underlying theme is about water and power in this desert city.  The action takes place in the 1930s, and the details of that period of time are well portrayed, right down to Faye Dunaway's shaved and penciled eyebrows. The screenplay won an Academy Award and I can understand why.  It was tightly written and revealed details that moved the plot forward at just the right pace.  I sat there fascinated, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen, trying to figure out what would happen next and constantly surprised by the next twist and turn.  John Huston is cast in the role of a wealthy landowner with a huge secret of his own.  He's a fine actor and his presence on the screen added depth to the whole production.
The DVD has a special interview with the writer, Robert Towne, as well as Roman Polanski.  This added to my enjoyment of the film and provided further insight about its production.  Definitely recommended.",1032566400,16,1674,4.533333333333333

John Huston plays what is easily one of the most compelling and evil roles ever put on film.

1250545,5,B000022TSH,"'Chinatown' is, without a doubt, the best of Polanski's films This is an exceptionally well-crafted film with so many layers, and subplots happening that you must watch this film from beginning to end with no interruptions.
Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, a private detective whose main specialty is spying on straying spouses. His services are retained by a wealthy woman by the name of Evelyn Mulwray who suspects that her husband is being unfaithful to her. What should be a simple case of finding out whether Mr Mulwray is being unfaithful or not begins to resemble an English maze in which Jake finds himself getting deeper and deeper in the middle of. He begins to uncover a labyrinth of corruption and lies, to a point where Jake has trouble distinguishing his friends from his foes.
It also becomes apparent that Evelyn has her own agenda, and that she may be using Jake. But for what purpose is not initially known, but as the plot progresses Jake comes to realise how little he really knows about Chinatown.
This film's intriguing title is actually a metaphor for corruption and deceit, Robert Towne named it so when a vice cop told him that he worked the Chinatown beat and did as little as possible, and about the corruption.
Interestingly, this was the second film that Polanski made after the heinous tragedy he suffered four years prior. This is obvious by his dark, brooding, albeit realistic look at the corruption within the Los Angeles culture of the time. And he never attempts to gloss over anything.
Polanski should have won the Oscar for Best Director for this film surely, but since when have the truly deserving ever won that accolade?",1030665600,7,1665,4.804878048780488
1250555,5,B000022TSH,"In ""Chinatown"", Jack Nicholson plays a hard-boiled, yet decent private eye, Jake Gittes, who is drawn into a labyrinth of corruption and evil involving the misappropriation of water during a drought in 1930's Los Angeles County.
Faye Dunaway plays the beautiful and enigmatic Evelyn Mulwray whose husband uncovers the misdeeds. He is murdered as a result.
""Chinatown"" is a tour de force in every aspect from the slyly engrossing direction of Roman Polanski to the brisk and ingenious screenplay by Robert Towne.
The performances are uniformly superb.  Nicholson is 100% believable as the sardonic, weary, and compassionate detective.  And Faye Dunaway proves yet again that she is more than simply a classic beauty.  (And her beauty is quite extraordinary indeed!)
Dunaway subtly conveys the intelligence, anguish, and tragedy of her femme fatale character.  Hers is a heartbreaking, richly layered performance.
From the onset, Dunaway is able to suggest that Evelyn Mulwray's icy composure is merely a defense mechanism which hides unspeakable trauma.  You come to realize just how vulnerable and fragile her seemingly impenetrable persona is.
""Chinatown"" is an intellectual, gut-wrenching masterpiece. It represents the work of artists at the peak of their skills.  ""Chinatown"" has and will endure as one of the finest movies ever made.",1029110400,5,1338,5.4396135265700485
1250556,5,B000022TSH,"About an hour into ""Chinatown"", Noah Cross (John Huston) says to Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.""  Gittes, whose heard this rap before, just smiles.  ""Why is that funny?"" asks Cross.  ""It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.""  If any exchange defines ""Chinatown"" the movie then this is it.  It's a film where the cliched metaphor of the onion is quite apt: the more layers you peel away, the more layers you find.  And the less you're likely to understand.  It begins life as a simple detective story, but eventually spins out of control into a web of intrigue (another cliched metaphor) that not only includes the murder of water commissioner Hollis Mulwray, but the entirety of 1930's Los Angeles.
Into this web is sprung Jake Gittes, a man who seems to be a typical film noir detective, but upon closer inspection is much more.  Or, as we shall see, much less.  I'd argue that Jake is an existential anti-hero, seemingly in control of every situation he enters in to, but ultimately just a pawn on an unfathomable chessboard.  Minor notes in the movie confirm this hypothesis.  A former client calls Jake on the phone, looking for his discretion.  ""Are you alone, Mr. Gittes?"" she asks.  ""Isn't everybody?"" Jake replies, clowning for his operatives, but saying more than he really intends to.  It's not the last time he inadvertently comments on the futility of his existence.  ""That must really smart,"" says Yelburton, the deputy water commissioner, regarding Jake's newly bandaged nose.  ""Only when I breathe,"" he replies, pointing out the paradox.  The bandaged nose also acts like a mask.  Whereas Jake starts the movie as a handsome man in a slick suit (this is primetime Nicholson), he is slowly physically destroyed.  The bandage is just the icing on the cake; it serves as a mask during the movie's middle third, hiding Jake's face and, at the same time, suppressing his identity.  Identity, as an issue, is clouded by the fact that no one he meets can seem to get his name right.  Cross, in what may be intentional, keeps calling him ""Mr. Gitz"" (correctly pronounced, 'Gittes' rhymes with 'kitties').  So not only is he a man with no face, he is a man with no name.  Jake Gittes, as he gets deeper and deeper into the mysteries surrounding him, is ceasing to exist.
But that's not to say that he is a cipher of a character.  How could he be when played by such a vibrant actor?  Nicholson is subdued and cool here, in just the right amounts.  He captures Jake's slow decent into near madness perfectly, while always allowing the man some sense of control.  Nicholson is always watchable in whatever he does, but this may be his best performance because it asks him to tone down his manic energy, allowing it to bubble over in moments, while alluding to it as subtext in others.
Behind him, the acting is mostly superb.  John Huston, in his few brief scenes, makes an indelible mark as the pure face of evil.  Huston's deep, gravelly voice and imposing -- even at age 68 -- frame do a lot at conveying the man's power, while his twinkling eyes draw you to him, even though you know better.  Although best known as a legendary director, Huston nearly steals the show here.  Not faring as well is Faye Dunaway.  She plays her femme fatale role with a bit too much iciness, and, in moments, melodrama.  Although she holds her own, and portrays great anguish, in the film's climactic confessional scene, for the most part Dunaway isn't up to snuff.
Roman Polanski, who takes a brief but memorable role as the Man With Knife (that's how he's quite functionally billed), directs with his usual visual flare.  Shots are composed as reflections in camera lenses or in a car's side mirror.  The opening scene begins with a series of photographs detailing one wife's infidelity.  Without saying anything, and without showing the audience the room around them, the scene is set perfectly.  It's archetypal of how he shoots the rest of the film: with style and subtlety.
Maybe I put too much stock in what William Goldman has to say, but ""Chinatown"" has to be a frontrunner when tallying up the best screenplays of all time.  A good screenplay will have two things going for it: a strong structure (of vital importance always), and interesting dialogue (useful in supporting the structure and in adding colour to the proceedings).  Towne gets full marks on both counts.  Structurally, it's a dream, a marvelous example of the micro turning into the macro as the web of intrigue broadens exponentially, while maintaining its power on the smaller scale all along.  Add to this the crisp, precise dialogue, and you've got a screenplay that's as much fun to listen to as it is to follow.  Jake is full of wisecracks and homespun wisdom.  When asked about Mulwray's character, Yelburton denies ever hearing him talk about infidelity: ""He never even kids about it.""  ""Maybe he takes it very seriously,"" says Jake.  When Cross asks if Lou Escobar, the investigating officer who's handling the Mulwray murder case, is an honest man, Jakes replies, ""Far as it goes... of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.""  On its own this would be a great line, but in ""Chinatown"", where the water of L.A. plays a major role in the plot, its damn well genius.
""Chinatown"" is much more than your average detective story.  It's a narrative dripping in character, intrigue, and history.  I'd sure like to see just what it was that happened in Chinatown, back in Jake's days on the police force, which made him the cynical sleuth he's become.  It'd make a great prequel.  As it stands, the movie we've got is a crackerjack yarn, rich enough to demand multiple viewings.",1027728000,160,5743,4.711133400200602
1250557,5,B000022TSH,"Roman Polanski's `Chinatown' is apt to fill a movie lover with longing for a lost time in Hollywood. Polanski himself, being interviewed for the DVD release, expresses with certainty that a movie such as `Chinatown' could never be produced in today's commercial climate. The story, concerning private eye Jake Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray, with its willingness to construct a realistic ending and its refusal to condescend to the audience, seems almost unthinkable in an age that focuses on cheap distraction for entertainment. Thankfully, though, `Chinatown' was created under the necessary circumstances to leave us with this absorbing motion picture.
`Chinatown' begins as an ode to the old noir films, the black and white classics. It features a cool private eye, a seemingly deadly femme fatale, and a scandal just underneath the surface. However, `Chinatown,' made in the 70s, delves deeper into the possibilities than might be expected. It is a color picture, its private eye in a man pained by loneliness, its femme fatale might just be the most decent individual in the film, and the scandal deals not with diamonds or other typical noir devices - but a conspiracy involving water and power.
Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, the private eye at the story's center. `Chinatown' was made before Nicholson had become a huge star. At the time, Nicholson was certainly known, yet he had not quite become `Jack Nicholson' the icon, the personality, the character known for going over the top. In `Chinatown' Nicholson was able to explore his character, and give a wonderful subtle performance. Gittes is a man who pretends to maintain a sense of distance from his clients. Yet as the narrative unfolds, he finds himself more and more incapable of keeping that faade. Gittes' detective work results in his becoming involved in a conspiracy that goes beyond his call of duty. One may wonder why he opted to do these things; but, like all great films, `Chinatown' does not provide the audience with easy answers - the film trusts our intelligence.
`Chinatown' offers little commentary as the story progresses. What Polanski does here, rather than stopping to bring the viewer up to speed, is simply drop us in the film and allow us to explore for ourselves. Being a motion picture, `Chinatown' emphasizes the importance of images rather than words. While a great deal of the picture is essentially dialogue, the setting, combined with the actor's facial expressions and gestures, conveys a particular mood. Polanski does a superior job of interweaving the unfolding scandal and the revelations about the characters' secrets. We are confused at first, wondering what is taking place, and then confused once it has been revealed - because we know not what to do. `Chinatown' successfully constructs a general emotion as the movie progresses - a sense of disorder and hopelessness - that ultimately reaches its climax during the scene's famous finale.
Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne reportedly feuded over the film's closing scene. While Towne campaigned for a slightly more upbeat conclusion, Polanski felt that his version of the ending must be upheld `for the film to have any meaning' (as he said in the DVD interview). Indeed, the ending of `Chinatown' remains as one of the most powerful scenes in the history of movies - it manages to express a whirlwind of feelings, none of which point towards any possible conclusion. This illustration of helplessness and commotion in the face of powers that we cannot control perfectly articulates sentiments that all of us have encountered.",1026950400,5,3591,5.1192504258943785

I always admired his charisma, but it wasn't until I watched this film that I grasped what an amazingly subtle and powerful actor he actually was in his prime. He takes a role Bogart would have been proud to play and in some ways redefines the role.
The rest of the cast also rises to the occasion, the script is crisp, hard-boiled and full of memorable lines. Polanski shows us pre-war LA through a jaundiced lens; an uncompromising, rough world where such things as truth, compassion and hope can be ground into dust by power and corruption.
Not to be overlooked by any means is the movie's evocative and memorable score, which sets the perfect tone of film noir at the beginning, and adds unforgettable impact to the movie's tragic ending.

1250563,5,B000022TSH,"""Chinatown"" arguably represents Jack Nicholson at his very best in his most enduring role, despite not having received an Oscar for his effort.  Fortunately Robert Towne netted an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in what film experts consider one of the greatest scenarios ever written.  Screenwriting guru Syd Field has used the Towne script as a working model for a generation as a teaching guide.
The muted photography of cinematographer John A. Alonzo along with the neatly selected settings reveal Los Angeles in 1937.  Jack Gittes is a Los Angeles detective initially used as a fall guy in a battle for water rights.  The longer Nicholson as Gittes investigates, the more convinced he becomes that the man behind the skullduggery, which ultimately results in the murder of Horace Mulwray, the honest head of the Department of Water and Power who does not want to build a new dam and risk a tragedy such as the earlier described Van Lipp disaster, is super wealthy Noah Cross, played by John Huston.
Gittes is a man used to dealing with criminal minds less powerful and less ruthless than Cross.  As Robert Towne noted in an interview about the film, a major element of ""Chinatown"" is the shocking realization on the part of Nicholson, who had formerly worked as a police officer assigned to Chinatown, that John Huston as Noah Cross is a man who will do anything to get what he wants, and is more ruthless than anyone he ever encountered.  When an exasperated Gittes asks Cross at one point what he can possibly gain through a big land payoff predicated on accessibility to water, noting that he could buy anything he wanted presently, Cross answers, ""The future, Mr. Gittes, the future.""
Towne shrewdly used a historical controversy from Los Angeles history, the career of William Mulholland and the tragedy of the Van Norman Dam.  History was juxtaposed and the controversy was moved from the first decade of the twentieth century to 1937.  It made good sense cinematically since the city was so much more developed by that time.
Another integral element of the film is Nicholson's developing romantic relationship with Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray, widow of the slain water chief and daughter of Noah Cross.  Gittes'  romantic progress is slowed by the manner in which he holds Evelyn, an erudite, sophisticated woman in awe, someone removed from his own rough and tumble middle class world.  He ultimately learns that the daughter toward whom Evelyn is so protective was sired by none other than Noah Cross.
In addition to adroitly directing the film, maintaining a consistently brisk pace, Roman Polanski also had a small but key acting role.  Playing one of Cross' thugs, he tells Gittes, ""You've got a big nose, kitty cat.""  To prove his point, while another Cross hoodlum, a crooked ex-sheriff, holds Gittes, Polanski snips off part of the detective's nose with a knife.",1011398400,,2888,4.929896907216495
1250564,5,B000022TSH,"If it wasn't for the fact that most of the cast would have been too young or not born yet, this movie could have been made in the 1930's or 1940's. It reminds one of the film noirs that Hollywood used to make during that time period. It is a superb example of film making, certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen.
Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties, who can be as hard-boiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different: He is intelligent, dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate into an extra-martial affair she believes her husband is having. However, the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles, which is in the middle of a drought. A series of double-crosses, murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion.
If the saying ""They don't make them like they used to"" was ever more true, it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters, yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman, we never see frontal nudity of her (Directors today would do just the opposite). Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today, especially the ending (Which, if you haven't seen the movie, I cannot reveal).
Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties, but the rest of the supporting cast (Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father) is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress, only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately, Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition, the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski (Who has a cameo in the movie as the knife-welding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose), but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather, Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay, which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie, one will know why.

The story follows the typical gumshoe format - loner private eye with a mysterious past, a damsel in distress that's also on the dangerous side, plot twists, mysterious secondary characters and an ultimate goal. This time it's not money, gold or a bird statue - it's water and land. Set in LA in the '30s, its style and writing give you a great understanding of what life was like back then (the other film that I can think of that does the same is LA Confidential). Jack Nicholson as J.J. Gittes delivers a great performance. I'm not much of a Nicholson fan - especially in his latter years. But I was truly impressed by his performance in this movie. We see the movie from his vantage point so he is always on the screen. We learn details about the case as he learns them. Polanski's directing style really draws you into the plot - you are there with Jake, experiencing everything he experiences. It's truly a great directing job.

It is laughable that this is being compared to 'The Usual Suspects' (which is at least million times better!).  This is a pathetic movie, the ending tries to surprise you and it does, because it is so stupid!
Jack Nicholson does a good job, but even his acting cannot hide the fact that this movie stinks.  Some comments say that this one is the best Film Noir till date, and I have one word for such reviews: Baloney!

1250587,4,B000022TSH,"""Chinatown"" is one of Hollywood's most over-rated films. Yes, it is superbly made, the script is a model of tightness, the actors are wonderful, the sense of Santa Ana heat nearly palpable. It's a well-upholstered bit of craftsmanship, although there's hardly anything unique in that. Hollywood has never lacked the ability to mount elegantly expensive productions. What it has consistently been incapable of is transcending popular forms, of giving us something *more* than just a handsome piece of entertainment. ""Chinatown"" is no exception.
For, in the final analysis, ""Chinatown"" is nothing but a meticulously engineered pastiche of a hard-boiled detective story. Don't get me wrong, I love detective fiction. I just don't think it should be sentimentalized into anything more than it is. If the film has any claims to distinction at all, it is for its creamy style, not its slightly atypical focus on the seedy, rotten and hypocritical aspects of American life. Since Hollywood doesn't usually like to show America as anything other than a sunny, adolescent playground, however, the film's mildly critical gestures may seem more insightful than they are.
There is nothing radical or subversive about this criticism. In fact, quite the contrary. Recognizing that money buys power and that the powerful frequently get away with much for which the rest of us are punished is hardly profound. It is a message with which we all could agree before entering the theater. There really isn't much more to ""Chinatown's"" social critique than spinning this truism into an intricate spider web of complicity. To compensate for genuine insight, Towne and Polanski kink up the story a bit, giving the it the veneer of the new and the specific, while also turning corruption into something safely personal. Such mild criticism in fact *confirms* people's preconceptions by repeating a common sense recognition while conveniently locating it somewhere else. Decadence becomes the problem of a few misguided individuals; the rest of us would be fine if we could just get rid of those bad guys.
Of course, to expect radical criticism of American society from a big-budget, star-studded Hollywood production is, to put it mildly, naive. That is my point: the bottom line is that ""Chinatown"" is limited by the middle-brow mind set of the industry that produced it, the requirement to make money, the need to please. The very care exercised in its production insures its expense; its expense requires a large return on investment; the requirement for a large audience makes impossible any criticism that might deeply offend anyone. ""Chinatown"" is posh, sexy entertainment, a very good film to be sure. As it unabashedly caters to people's prejudices, however, it proves it is far from being a great one.",989107200,11,2786,5.17960088691796
1250588,5,B000022TSH,"One of the greatest film mysteries of all time is CHINATOWN, and this DVD finally presents a video version worthy of the film. In sparkling clear and colorful film noir, we see Robert Towne's masterful story acted by a stupendous cast of performers, none of whom has ever been better.
No need to go into the specifics of the mystery. Ace detective Jake Gittes is on the trail of a murdered water commissioner whose wife has her own series of mysteries she's covering. In true mystery-fashion, the plot is labyrinthine on first viewing, but it all flows together beautifully once the resolution is presented and one has a chance to review all the twists and turns.
The DVD features the movie's first anamorphic widescreen presentation, and it's a joy to behold. Seriously saturated colors and a sharp picture make the previous laserdisc incarnation (up until the DVD release the only widescreen version available) insupportable.

1250590,5,B000022TSH,"'Chinatown' is one of those rare film that is absolutely perfect. Sure
there are plenty of films that have very few flaws, but they are not as
complex as this movie, nor are their plots as brilliantly put together.
Many people who dislike the film have called it boring and they do not
like the ending. They forget the film is about a serious subject matter
and shouldn't be handled like an action movie. Polanski, along with the
rest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the way
it should be. Polanski does not insult the viewers' intelligence. He
forces us to use our imagination about past events and events that are
currently happening. It may take several viewing to put all the pieces
together, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful. Even
though the film ends on an unhappy note, people must understand why the
film ended that way. The ending is one of the reasons the film is so
powerful and unforgettable. But that will be discussed a little later.

'Chinatown' is the story of a private eye detective J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes
(Nicholson) who investigates the extramarital affair of a prominent
engineer in Los Angeles. It is set in the 1930s, and the city is
suffering a major drought. Even though the city is going through a
drought, Gittes discovers that thousands of gallons of water is being
dumped at night. He is dumbfounded, but he does not realize he is about
to enter a conspiracy involving the elite of the city. This conspiracy
stretches out to the farmers in the surrounding land. He is warned on
several occasions throughout the film about what he is getting into,
but he still enters the lion's mouth full speed ahead. Jack Nicholson
gives one of the great performances of his career. Even though all the
actors did a superb job, including Faye Dunaway, Nicholson still towers
above anyone else. There is a reason he is considered one of the all
time greats. So few actors can bring such range into their roles. He is
funny as hell when he needs to be and serious and sensitive the story
requires it.

The film is also carried by its brilliant screenplay. The screenplay
has been hailed one of the best of all time, and I find that hard to
argue. The dialog is so well written, it is an absolute joy watch time
an again. Graphics can become dates, action sequences can become tame,
but good dialog is timeless. Apparently, Robert Towne, the main screen
writer, turned down 'The Great Gatsby' to instead write 'Chinatown'. He
would have made a lot more money writing 'Gatsby', but inspiration won
over dollars. He made the right decision because what he gave us was a
screenplay for the ages. It is wickedly clever, intelligent, and
cynical. Towne must have been at the pinnacle of his career.

Many people have voiced their displeasure at the ending of the film.
They feel it is depressing. They feel the film should not have ended
that way. They feel that people have overrated the film because of the
ending. To me, the ending is absolutely brilliant. It should rank as
one of the great endings in film history. In the ending, the ghosts of
the past coming crashing like a tidal wave. Notice in the ending, it is
only time Evelyn and Noah Cross are together in the movie. Notice that
in the ending, things are so confusing, hardly anyone can figure out
what is happening. Throughout the film, Jake talks about Chinatown, or
how he doesn't like talking about it. Jake really does not realize what
he is getting into. What he is getting into is destiny. All the money
or motivation in the world cannot stop destiny from happening. And this
destiny is not always happy. In fact, it can be downright brutal. At
times in this life, there are forces beyond one's control. What a
phenomenal achievement in film-making.",979257600,,3769,4.639221556886228
1250591,5,B000022TSH,"It's too bad that Chinatown and Godfather II were both released in the same Oscar year, because both films are the two greatest in the post-WW II era. Godfather II gets the edge as the better of the two, i.e., the best film of our times.
That said, none of this takes away from the pure brilliance of Chinatown. Like Godfather II, its understated script is a model of great writing, advancing the characters and the plot with every word. ""I tried to keep someone from being hurt,"" Nicholson says, in the middle of the movie during its sole love scene, ""and, instead, I made sure she was hurt."" How many movies have a bedroom scene with dialogue that haunting in its ability to foreshadow? Chinatown remains the greatest of film noir by far because it extends the genre's possibilities while still remaining respectful of its traditions. The standard, thematic foundation remains true: A film noir protagonist enters a situation and assumes he's in complete control. But the situation actually has control of him - reality that the protagonist eventually recognizes, only far too late. Polanski's tone and legendary attention to detail are dead-on: Water emerges as not only an effective scene and mood setter, but an essential character, a symbol of purity corrupted. Chinatown is a labyrinth, not only because of  its remarkably complex but perfectly executed plot, but with respect to mood and image. Mysterious gives way to murky, then melancholy. Cynicism gives way to hope, then to irreversible loss. Is the ending too dark? In today's 'artistic vision dictated by Hollywood marketing' world, yep. (`Waitaminute, lemme get this straight: The chick gets a slug in the eye and the little girl ends up with the old pervert? Honey, get me rewrite ...') But Polanski's conclusion is really the only way the movie should have ended, as opposed to Towne's preference to provide a glimmer of optimism. Acting wise, a brilliant ensemble, even down to a one-scene cameo by great character actor Charles Knapp as a hacking, engaging mortician. (""In the middle of a drought, a bum drowns. Only in L.A. ..."") Dunaway was never more sympathetically conflicted. And it could be Nicholson's best performance ever. Save for a slight detour in a confrontational barber shop scene (in which he assumes his broad, `rebel Jack' persona), it's easily his most subtle and multi-layered. His Jake is troubled by something, but Nicholson and Polanski leave it to the audience to discover what it is. Stack this alongside Nicholson's 1990s `work' and you'd question whether it's the same actor. It isn't. Which is why film enthusiasts should savor Chinatown.

1250594,5,B000022TSH,"In my opinion, CHINATOWN is the last masterpiece presented by polish director Roman Polanski. After this 1973 movie, Polanski will shoot good if not excellent movies that nevertheless won't match such references as REPULSION or CUL-DE-SAC directed in the sixties.
CHINATOWN is the one-time gathering of a director, a producer and a screenwriter who joined for creating a common project. This situation would hardly happen nowadays ; cinema is becoming so dependent on economic issues that movies all look the same and hardly translate into images the genuine vision of a director. Just think that under the severe studio laws of the 30's, 40's and 50's, such talented directors as Alfred Hitchcock, Vincente Minnelli or Fritz Lang were able to create a personal cinematographic world notwithstanding the studio pressures. On the contrary, less than ten american directors in activity can be considered today as authors-directors. And, for the most of them, they are growing very old.
Even if you are not particularly fond of the film noir genre, you cannot neglect CHINATOWN and its story of a private detective Jack "" Jake Gittes "" Nicholson searching for the truth in a Los Angeles sweating corruption and hidden sins. He will have to face another Hollywood giant - John Huston - before giving up in a pessimist finale  la ... Huston.

""Chinatown"" is closest to being commercial because of its genre type, but a comparison to any of the film noirs of the forties or to the more recent ""L.A.

The  reviews here pushed me to watch it in totality.  The slow moving  description still holds but, in the context of the entire movie, it works.  The story and looks are film noir, Raymond Chandler style.  Nicholson plays  a somewhat jaded PI who, at the beginning doesn't think the truth is  necessarily a good thing ('let sleeping dogs lie') but who still has a  heart.  Perplexed by what he knows he does seek out the truth.  The movie  is told entirely from his perspective.  We learn what he learns and see  what he sees.  The plot expands around a number of odd events that the  movie slowly ties together.  There are jolts and twists up until the end as  the relationship between Nicholson and Dunaway grows.
There is almost  nothing wrong with this film.  At least I couldn't find anything.  The  directing is top notch.  Polanski's slow moving sequences actually provide  symbolic function or help the feel of reality in the movie.  The acting -  unbelievable.  The writing is flawless.

1250602,5,B000022TSH,"Ah, the good ol' days of the 1930s. Gritty private eyes, rich socialites,  political corruption. All of these long forgotten qualities are showcased  in Roman Polanski's Chinatown, the 1970s film noir detective classic about  J.J. Gittes' journey through the tangled web of a Los Angeles mystery. Jack  Nicholson provides yet another timeless role as the hard-boiled Gittes,  whose investigation of an illeged affair leads to a road of corruption,  power, incest, and money. Faye Dunaway is also brilliant as the tortured  Evelyn Mulray, who lives in her father's dark shadow and hides an  incredible secret that brings down her world.
Every aspect of this movie  resulted in flawless filmaking, from the shady cinamatography to the  changes of scenery in and around Southern California. Polanski creates a  multitude of sleazy characters, all of whom hide dark flaws, even Gittes.  In Gittes' world, no man (or woman) can escape from the city's corruption;  this is Polanski's ultimate goal, to show the flaws in his characters.  Polanski himself even makes a cameo appearance, as a knife-wielding hoodlum  who gives Gittes alot of pain, literally. But the most interesting  character, besides Gittes, is John Huston's Noah Cross, the rich water boss  who is seemingly capable of any crime. His dense character begs the viewer  to ask, ""What drives this guy to be evil?""
Chinatown is a  classic, the kind of movie that comes along every 20 years and causes  multiple rentals and becomes a staple of any movie buff's collection.  Nicholson, Dunaway and Houston all give memorable performances, perhaps the  best of their careers, and Polanski pieces the story together into a  mystery/drama/noir, which never gets boring. Every movie fan should be  forced to watch this movie and exclaim, ""What ever happened to making  good movies?"" Well, they don't make movies like they used to.",962236800,2,1881,5.1694352159468435
1250603,5,B000022TSH,"I am convinced that the 3 or 4 people who complained about the ending just didn't understand it (one person even said that the movie didn't take place in Chinatown! ).
OK, here it is. The reason Chinatown is universally  regarded as a classic and why it won the Oscar for best screenplay is the  way the Chinatown theme runs throughout the plot as a metaphor for Giddes's  past life. He tells us that Chinatown was a place he worked as cop where  the job was to ""do as little as possible"" where ""you never  knew what was going on"" and where he had tried to help a woman but had  only ended up hurting her.
At the end when Evelyn has been  killed--despite jake's efforts to save her--and when Jake realizes that the  police are going to ignore Cross's crimes, Jake whispers (barely audible)  ""as little as possible"" and then his partner says ""Come on  Jake, it's Chinatown.""
The ending ties up everything that has  happened in the rest of the film, and, by extension, in Jake's life.
As  Movieline's Top 100 film site says: ""The best thing Jack Nicholson  will ever do. The best thing Faye Dunaway will ever do. The best thing  Roman Polanski will ever do. The best thing Robert Towne will ever do.  Etc.""",960940800,4,1204,4.433789954337899
1250604,5,B000022TSH,"Hard-boiled, cynical characters, seasoned with just the right amount of sleaze. Private detective Jake Giddes (Jack Nicholson) specializes in marital cataclysms, and that's how Chinatown opens.  A client named Curly  is looking at photos in Jake Giddes' office, photos of his wife making love  with another man. Curly moans in anguish. He drops the photographs on  Giddes' desk and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes; a drop  plunks on Gittes' shiny desktop. Gittes looks at the drop of sweat, glances  at the fan whirring overhead. He looks crisp and cool in his white linen  suit despite the heat. Without taking his eyes off Curly he lights a  cigarette.
This is our introduction to Jake Giddes, definitely not a  high-society detective, even if he does have a secretary and two  ""operatives"". Jake will remain fastidious in dress throughout the  picture -- except when he's getting beat up.
Faye Dunaway, as Evelyn  Cross Mulwray, may have performed as brilliantly in another film, but never  better. Evelyn's beauty is somewhat faded and is all the more magnetic for  it, and she reveals throughout the film a desperate honesty that makes you  want to take her in your arms and comfort her.
John Houston is a perfect  Noah Cross, Evelyn's chillingly pragmatic, super-rich, super-cynical and  corrupt father. Near the end he tells Jake, without the slightest display  of emotion: ""You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the  fact that at the right time and right place, they're capable of  anything.""
Jake's exterior is tough-as-nails, but deep inside runs a  streak of believable compassion. He's not a Mike Hammer; he displays fear  when that's appropriate; he's cautious when caution is called for. In this  picture Nicholson has not one humorous line. He plays the character Towne  created. Even Noah Cross, who seems to revel in his complete lack of  fatherly compassion for his daughter, reveals in the end that his granite  exterior is a veneer -- even if he believed it was real until a crucial  test proved him wrong.
The underlying theme of Chinatown is Los Angeles'  insatiable thirst for water. The opening of the reservoir gates for  clandestine nightly discharges of water into the ocean was based on fact,  even if the movie was set in the thirties and that activity was carried out  in about 1907. The purpose was to amplify a water shortage to gain public  support for bonds to finance the Los Angeles Aqueduct to bring in water  from Owens Valley. The water was stolen from the Owens Valley and carried  to L.A. through a 230-mile aqueduct.
Noah Cross' explanation to Gittes  about how Los Angeles would annex much of the San Fernando Valley so the  water brought there would technically be brought to L.A. actually occurred,  but in 1913. And the buying up by L.A. big-shots of thousands of acres of  cheap desert destined to become valuable irrigated farm land was based on  the genuine occurrence.
This is screenwriter Robert Towne at his  inimitable best. A rare and expansive look into Towne's brilliant approach  to this screenplay can be gained by viewing the PBS video ""Cadillac  Desert"" (available from Amazon.com), from the book by Marc Reisner.  Towne appears in interviews again and again, along with clips from  Chinatown.
Chinatown is a classic use of the silver screen. Like at least  one reviewer below, I recommended that you buy this video, for it should be  viewed several times to get the full benefit of a masterful screenplay,  Roman Polanski's outstanding direction, great performances by a  distinguished cast, photography that is right on the mark in every scene,  and all supported by superb music.

1250605,5,B000022TSH,"The water is the source of all evil, in the middle of a drought it is the Holy Grail for the greedy and the depraved, but I'm getting ahead of myself.
 Chinatown, Roman Polanski's brooding film noir is a film of many secrets. Like the best of films, the dialogue makes the audience feel that they're only getting part of the story, like there is this whole other world of decadence that surrounds these characters, its not just a story but a glimpse into another time and place. Take for example the title of the film ""Chinatown"", I'm not spoiling anything by telling you that the Chinatown is not a major theme in the film, its a place Jake Gettis used to work as a cop, its also where the climax of the film takes place. We don't actually see much of this place in the film but when Gettis meets his old nemisis/pal Lou Escobar who used to work with him there, we picture it, making the world of the film that much larger.
 In order to fully appreciate Chinatown, you must really look at the character of J.J.  Gittes played by Jack Nicholson in a career best performance. He is a Private Eye, but he is not your average movie hero, he in no desperate loner, he is no Martin Riggs. He runs his office like a modern firm complete with assistants and a secertary, he tells vulgar and inane jokes about sex just like rest of us do and most of all he is deeply cynical and intelligent. When his investigation does get personal, this is how he chooses to explain his determination to continue it: ""Half of the city is trying to cover it all up which is fine by me, but I damn near lost my nose, and I like it, I like breathing through it"".
 The woman, and there is always a woman, is Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). As the rich, vunreable and mysterious widow she is more sensual then pretty. With that psuedo British accent, the vast wealth and the deceased husband she obviously indicates trouble. It is a mark of Chinatown's greatness that she is not a caricature, but a nervous wounded human being.
 The juciest performance in the film however belongs to John Huston as the all powerful Noah Cross. He is a man so blatantly depraved, that he prides himself in his depravity. ""You have a nasty reputation Mr. Gettes, I like that"" he says. But the main reason I bring him up is because he utters my favourite line in movie history, and I had to include that: ""Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough.""
 It is fascinating to compare Chinatown to L.A.  Confidential (also a masterpiece) but their approaches are as different as night and day. In Chinatown Polanski employs what is called mise-en-scene, which is a technique that treats every scene as if it were performed on a stage. As a result the pace of the film is deliberate and builds on detail.  This pace makes the film less forceful, but more creepy, its takes its time to get under your skin. In L.A. Confidential on the other hand Curits Hanson employed a lot of montage, remember the sequence in that film with ""Wheel of Fortune"" on the soundtrack and a progression of events happening on screen. This makes the film's impact more immediate and satisfying. By comparison Chinatown needs at least 3 viewings for you to really get the feel for it. For the record I don't prefer one over the other, they just have different styles, each delicious in its own way. The difference between the two film is best represented by the difference in their music(both scores were written by Jerry Goldsmith). For Chinatown he does a lot of horn solos to achieve a creepy errie effect, for L.A.  Confidential his score is thumping and forceful.
 I must admit, I don't like the film's ending. I can't reveal it here because Amazon doesn't allow spoilers, but I've always felt it was a bit of a cop-out...
 The first time I saw Chinatown was about a year ago, I've watched it about once a month since then. Each time I admire it a little more, get a firmer grip on the ingenious complicated plot and soak up more of that decadent atmosphere. Watch this film for the first time and you will like it, watch for the fourth and it'll blow you away.",958089600,8,4130,4.464190981432361
1250606,5,B000022TSH,"In case you haven't seen the film or read the 56 reviews of ""Chinatown"" preceding mine, I'll sum up briefly: Jack is a late-1930's ex-L.A. cop and private eye whose ""metier"" is  ""marital work.""  He is embarassed when the results of a marital  stakeout are leaked and used to smear a wealthy and otherwise uncorrupt  public official, ultimately to further the interests of one or more real  estate developers and/or water moguls.  Jack suspects that he is at the  center of a setup, and is confronted by Faye, the public official's  beautiful, long-suffering wife.  Who is behind the setup?  Why?  Jack and  Faye atttempt to solve this ""mystery"" together.  Faye hires Jack.  Except, to Faye, the answers to these questions were never really a  ""mystery""...  Or were they?  Even though we get a general idea of  the answers to our questions, not all of the ends tie up neatly.  (Exactly  what was the ""Albacore Club?""  Didn't Hollis Mulwray make an  unusual choice of mistress? Why her?)
This is a mystery in  which apparent answers only lead to more questions.
The film is  artfully and stylishly done.  The beauty is in the detail. Color, costumes,  cars,  and set designs are exquisite.  Although many reviewers seem to  consider it a noir classic, most scenes are day, with many sunny exterior  shots, which belie the darkness of the subject matter.
Beauty is  also seen in unique directorial and script touches.  We view the film  knowing no more than  Jack, the investigating private eye, and feel the  same frustrations.  He is not glamorous but he is certainly likeable  enough, and is intended for audience identification. He is not suave and  dashing. Although Jack is not usually a bungler, the ordinary ""little  people"" upon whom private eyes rely for the most important  information, are as unhelpful as can be.  So he encounters rudeness and  difficulty at every turn from everyday people: bureaucrats, secretaries,  barbershop customers, the snooty clerk at the hall of records, his  ex-colleagues in the police, and from a concierge at a rest home.  Faye's  patrician father purposely refuses to dignify Jack by pronouncing his last  name correctly. After almost drowning and getting soaked by a unexpected  gush from a storm sewer, he is unglamorously maimed by a pint-sized thug.  As a result, he must wear a bandage on his face through most of the film.  (I have never, before or since, seen a leading man in a movie with a  prominent bandage or scar on his face through most of a film.  Usually, the  bandage only stays for one scene.  Right?)  Later, Jack trespasses into an  orange grove in the course of his investigation.  The poor landowners, who  are also touched by the scandal, incorrectly assume that Jack is the root  of their problem, rather than their solution, and they severely beat him.  It seems that nothing goes right for him.
The film exposes a range human  flaws and weaknesses, too, which also adds realism to the story.  One of  the otherwise healthy-looking young men in orange grove needs a crutch to  walk.  Adultery is exposed, from the humiliation of a cuckolded immigrant  fisherman, and his wife's resulting black eye, to upper-class Faye's  surprising nonchalance about her husband's relationship. Corruption.  Greed  and slander. Violence. An obvious come-on line.
For people who like  Nicholson, it is a first-rate, and generally low-key performance, by his  standards, although he resorts to his fists.  Faye was and remains a  ravishing beauty.  Likewise, her acting is standout.
If you need happy  endings, this isn't the film for you.  Although it's a mystery, the movie  holds up well after repeat viewings.  There is a lot of plot to absorb on  the first viewing. This may explain the difficulty some reviewers have with  this film.",957052800,4,3788,4.924920127795527

They just don't make movies like this anymore.  Layers of stories  interwoven.  Also, the chemistry between Mr. Gittes and Noah Cross is  awesome (especially given Jack's real life interest in John Huston's  daughter).  To those who didn't like the ending, what did you want to see?  The whole point was that J.J. was way over his head and evil would  eventually triumph with Mr. Gittes rendered powerless.

People complain about the end  alot, but could this movie have been just as powerful and affecting without  it? I think not. In the end, evil wins, and Roman Polanski (director)  doesn't play a movie as if it were some sort of fantasy trip from our  everyday reality. Instead, he mocks our hopes for a happy ending and slaps  us in the face with it's tragic twist. Great film, beautiful VHS transfer  (I've never seen the DVD version).

1250615,5,B000022TSH,"""Chinatown"" is a faultlessly executed rendering of a steamy mix of scandal and corruption that came to be known generically as ""West-Coast Politics.""  The movie is fleshed out with familiar elements:  the backstage powerbroker  who has a thirst for water, land and, (above all), control;  the  hard-boiled-but-decent private dick whose hubris ultimately wreaks havoc on  the innocent;  the beautiful socialite desperately trying to conceal the  horrors of the past.
Jack Nicholson as private-eye J. J. Gittes provides  us with the hallmark rakish charm and unforgettable gumshoe dialog, (""Mrs.  Mulwray, I damn near lost my nose... and I LIKE it...  I like BREATHING through  it!"").  It is through the appealing persona of Gittes, (he is in virtually  every scene), that we see an insignificant ""matrimonial"" job unfold, first  into a case of mistaken identity with humorous undertones, then unravel  into a political/psychological nightmare.
 Faye Dunaway radiates the  perfect mixture of strength and vulnerability as Mrs. Mulwray; (notice how  she can't pronounce the word ""father"" without stuttering... a sad  foreshadowing of events to come).
 John Houston as Noah Cross is one  of the most compelling villains in cinema history.  A stewy admixture of  avuncular charm and loathsomeness, Cross seems to embody what we should  recognize intuitively in modern politics:  The charming and treacherous  liar.
 This cinematic gem employs a host of memorable secondary  characters - watch how Polanski, in his cameo, wears an expression that  quickly shifts from amusement to fury after Gittes refers to him as a  midget.  Everyone, from Investigating Detective Escobar and his hostile  cronies, to Gittes' petulant office secretary, or ""Morty,"" the L.A. County  Examiner, (who has one of the movie's funniest lines), provides proper  measures of banal levity or self-deception to the story.
As one who has  nearly worn-out a VHS copy of this great film, the DVD version was eagerly  anticipated.  This new version is not disappointing, particularly with the  restoration of the soundtrack.  This movie is a lesson in great  filmmaking.",950745600,3,2135,5.42638036809816
1250616,5,B000022TSH,"_Chinatown_ is a very nearly perfect gem of a film.  So few detective/mystery stories are ever attempted, largely because of the difficulty of effectively capturing the time period.  But _Chinatown_ pulls  this off, almost without effort.  We get a believable glimpse at life in LA  as it was in a simpler time, the 30s and 40s.  And the story is an  incredibly layered one, starting with the simple mechanics of what's  happening to the diverted water, eventually blowing up into something along  the lines of a Greek tragedy.
This was the film that really made Jack  Nicholson a star and Faye Dunaway is memorable as Evelyn Mulwray.  Whatever  happened to her acting career?  John Huston is the perfect embodiment of  evil and I love the way he purposely mispronounces Nicholson's character's  name.
The DVD is a great presentation, with lush jazz on the menu  screens.

If you watch the movie carefully, you  will find that this movie has a lot of subtle meanings relating to the  Bible,and as typically Polanski, Evil wins in the end.

1250619,5,B000022TSH,"After reading some of the more negative reviews of this movie, I noticed that one theme was their reason for a low rating: the ending.  Well, to those people I ask, ""What did you expect?""  Should they have all  happily walked off into the sunset?  Should Evelyn and Noah have just made  up?  Should they have escaped?  No.  Of course not.  If the movie teaches  us nothing less, it's that the world can often (and almost always is)  against us.
Take the scene when Jake first meets Evelyn.  He learns a  crude joke at the barbershop and can't wait to relate it to his employees,  unaware that she has opened the door to his office, and is standing right  behind him.  Jake's employees try to warn him, but he shakes them off.  With this scene, Polanski meant to show how often Jake got in over his  head.  How impetuous he was.  How he overestimated his abilities.  And how  he never truly thought something over before diving head-first into it.  He  is flawed and he thinks he's perfect.  He believes whatever happens to him  now is nothing compared to all the stuff that happened to him when he was a  beat cop patrolling Chinatown.  And he must be punished.
In short, this  is simply a great movie that deserved a lot more recognition than it  received.  A lot of the negative reviews say that it was overrated; it is  not overrated, it is a story, made for art, not commercial value.  Sometimes stories don't have the happy Hollywood ending, they have the  cold, distant ending that makes the viewer reflect on the wondrous art they  have just watched.",948326400,2,1557,4.498194945848375

1250622,5,B000022TSH,"Chinatown has been my favorite film since first seeing it seven years ago.  Over the years, my enjoyment has grown with each viewing.  The letterbox edition I recently purchased adds to the already outstanding production  quality with which I was previously aquainted.
This film succeeds on  every asthetic and entertainment level imaginable.  The mood,  characterizations, and pacing are outstanding.  The movie is an omage to a  gone, but not forgotten, film style, while the story and setting  simulateously pay homage to that lost era.  It stands as a hallmark of  modern filmmaking, unparallelled.
I keep wanting to write more and more  about this film I adore so much, but the highest praise cannot do justice  to this movie.  Not everyone will enjoy it.  The ending will alienate many  viewers.  Each moment draws you into the story, like a hypnotic trance, and  then the ending is as unnerving as anything ever put on celluloid.
I  encourage everyone to see several, ""mandatory"" films; Casablanca,  Citizen Kane, It's a Wonderful Life, The Apartment, Schindler's List, The  Seventh Seal.  This stands alongside, if not above, any of them.
Other  greats in this style are The Third Man, The Maltese Falcon, and The Big  Sleep.  The French Connection is a giant step down in quality, but decent.  It carries a similar style with similar themes and is from the same era,  the 70's.",945820800,2,1386,4.964912280701754

1250624,5,B000022TSH,"One of the reasons I liked ""Chinatown"" best is that it takes us back to a time when traditional film noir movies were made back in the 1940's.  It owes homage to them, from the style of the buildings and to the  cars and clothing.  I felt like I was stepping into that period of time.  Aside from the ""have sex the day you meet"" cliche which is  unfortunately in almost every movie, ""Chinatown"" is believable  and realistic.  The ultimate swipe at realism is the ending, which hasn't  quite pleased everyone.  People need to understand that not only is this  the real world were in, but that Chinatown was where the lead character  Jack Gittes quit working because of it's corruption.  And sadly, that Mrs.  Mulray's attempt to protect the daughter met with death when she tried to  escape, in Chinatown!  ""Chinatown"" is a metaphor about all that  has happened in the film and in the lives of the characters within it.  That, I feel, is the film's greatest aspect.  As for this DVD, I hate to  admit, it is something of a disappointment, for me anyway.  It does have  some nice things on it: a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack, production  notes, a trailer, and some retrospective interviews with the creators of  the film.  The film itself has been digitally remastered, making it the  ultimate home video experience.  However, the last time I saw  ""Chinatown"" was on the big screen, at the 25th Anniversary  screening of the film that sponsored the DVD and videotape release of  ""Chinatown"".  There, it was huge, big, and beautiful, preserving  every tiny detail and taking me to a place that movies today haven't taken  me before!  When I played the DVD, it, it just seemed so small, quite a  contrast from the theatrical experience.  At the theaterm the screen was so  big, I wasn't just watching the film.  I felt like I was really there!  I  suppose that is the best they can do with a video release of  ""Chinatown"", and you know it's never going to look at good as it  did in the theaters.  Still, I felt disappointed with it.  Oh well, it  doesn't take away from it being a really great film.
