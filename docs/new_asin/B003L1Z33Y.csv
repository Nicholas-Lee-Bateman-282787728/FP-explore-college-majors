4134590,5,B003L1Z33Y,"This is a gem of a workout and I really wish more people knew about it. It has become one of my most cherished fitness routines. I've been using this for several weeks now and my lower body looks amazing!!! My hips and thighs have never looked better or more slim (finally!) It is all floorwork, which has seriously gone missing from most current fitness dvds. You will work very hard but the results are worth it.
Other reviewers have compared this to the Original Buns of Steel with Greg Smithey and I have to agree. It's one tough routine. I've actually been rotating both of these for several weeks and I couldn't be more pleased with my results. If you have any issues at all with your lower body, you absolutely need this dvd :)",1315699200,22,734,4.404411764705882
4134591,5,B003L1Z33Y,"Loved this workout, I have used this DVD about for 3 weeks  and I see a difference already, my back side is lifted and taking on a rounder shape.  This DVD is not easy, it's pretty intense but if you do it consistently, you will see results.  Also, recommend Tonique 2 workout, they are pure cardio and they will get your heart rate up.",1314057600,3,336,4.21875
4134592,5,B003L1Z33Y,"Great workout for getting your butt into great shape.  Sylwia, the instructor, is such a sweetheart and a motivation.  I think she is great.  The mat workout is very intensive and you will feel it the next day.  I couldn't finish the whole dvd the first time.  The next day, I could barely sit down and couldn't believe how sore I was.  This is by far the best mat workout for your butt I have ever seen.  All of her DVDs are great.",1296259200,7,432,4.132530120481928
4134593,5,B003L1Z33Y,"This is a great workout for your legs, and butt although the moves seem simple Sylwia does so many reps its killer. She does all of the moves right along with you which i liked.  excellent mat workout.",1294531200,8,201,4.2894736842105265
4134594,5,B003L1Z33Y,"If you want to tone your legs and glutes without impact, this is the workout to get. Its a great dvd and it was shipped to me very quick. i highly recommend it!",1291075200,5,160,3.878787878787879
4134595,5,B003L1Z33Y,I love this dvd because it is challenging. Exercises have lots of reps so prepare to get worked but you will feel great when you are done. This dvd is for sure staying in my workout rotation. I would say it's sort of a mix between old school Buns Of Steel and Tracy Anderson. I can't wait to check out the other Tonique dvds now!!!,1287619200,8,331,4.107692307692307
4134596,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I LOVE this dvd. It is broken into 3 sections so you can pick and choose which you want to do - on the side, on the back (bridge position) and on the knees. Some of the exercises may seem simple but after doing 30 of each you are dying!",1285459200,3,236,3.74
4134597,4,B003L1Z33Y,"This is exactly what I was looking for!! Lots of different exercises for the stomach, butt and thighs.  The first time I did the workout I didn't like it because it seemed too difficult. But I really think it is working.  Some of the exercises I need to build up to, but this is something that I can continue to use and won't get bored with!",1280102400,6,341,4.151515151515151
4134598,5,B003L1Z33Y,"This workout is an all floor based workout concentrating on the butt, thighs and hips with a little core work thrown in as well.  It has got to be the toughest, most difficult mat workout I have ever done and I've been working out for a long time with the firm, the bar method, pure barre, and tracy anderson dvds. If I had to compare it any other workout it would be Buns of Steel - the original with Greg Smithey - which is very dated but extremely effective.  It has similar moves to it and even reminds me alot of Tracy Anderson's first dvd, excluding the standing work. It is about an hour in length but well worth the time to finish, trust me, this is one dvd you'll keep. Two words of warning: first, the music is a little dreary so if you're looking for fun, this isn't up your alley; second: it can be hard on the wrists, especially in the second half with all of the plank work and kneeling exercises.  But keeping those things in mind, this is absolutely worth getting for your collection if you want to change your lower body without lunges or squats. You'll not regret it. :)

Update - August 1, 2011 - I have continued to work out with this jewel of a video since I wrote the review above at least 3 times every week - 4 if I have the energy.  I haven't become bored from using it and my lower body is awesome looking - seriously I thought that I was getting great results from barre videos but there is nothing like this out there. I have wrist and knee issues and this has alleviated alot of those problems.  Every woman looking to have the tightest lower body possible without the bulk should buy this video and invest the time - it's MUCH better than anything out there on the market today.  I know because I've tried everything.",1277510400,59,1747,4.259818731117825
4134619,5,B003L1Z33Y,"This is another great workout from Sylwia.  It's great when you find something that does what it says and does what you want.  This program delivers as promised and beyond!! This is a challenging program for a man or a woman that delivers fantastic results.

This is why it works so well:
1) Simple to follow but challenging to perform
2) High reps to challenge all levels of fitness (From beginner to advanced.)
3) Exercises are demonstrated and performed in their entirety to provide motivation
4) Brilliant sequencing - trainers and fitness enthusiasts will recognize (and feel) the value of the sequence of exercises.  You will feel it working during and after!
5) Burns a lot of fat calories
6) Focused and efficient - each exercise is purposeful and targeted

I highly recommend this DVD as an excellent program to target the lower body and abdominals.  If you want to shed fat,  define your muscles, improve your endurance and appearance this is the best of the best programs available!",1370131200,5,993,4.840236686390533
4134620,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I workout a lot! I run marathons, spin, lift etc.  This workout WORKS! It is great for the dreaded ""saddle bag"" area and I have noticed that my thighs are slimmer and more toned! I try to do this workout 3 times a week.  Although I have done segments of it when I am in a hurry and i still feels the burn.",1360627200,14,305,3.8253968253968256
4134621,1,B003L1Z33Y,"I hate to give anyone or anything a bad review but, being serious about my workouts and knowing how people really have to work to fit in what they can in these busy days, I have to be honest...  The star I DID give is for the fact that, yes, you will get the results you are after by purchasing this video.  But GOOD GODDDDD (that's how strongly I feel about this)...ugggghhhh...  Anyone can get amazing results from doing every possible exercise we've ever learned since the beginning of time...A MILLION BORING TIMES before moving on to the next boring move.  OMG!  Basically, I would MUCH rather just have the TV on and do every exercise that comes to mind until I've exhausted it ON MY OWN but while at least WATCHING SOMETHING else.  I would get the same results.  This is worse than watching paint dry.

I actually just took away one more star because of the fact that, in busy lives where we all want to STAY MOTIVATED fitness-wise to get in our workouts, we all need something that's not going to make us glaze over and HATE working out.  I have fortunately been finding just those DVD's to keep me excited about getting mine in during the work week...this one did JUST THE OPPOSITE.  It gave me a horrifying flashback of a phase when I started to glaze over and think of fitness as BORING, LONG, WORK...  No No NOOOOOOO!  Anyone want mine?  If you pay the shipping, you can HAVE IT!  I refuse to screw up the optimism I've got toward fitness due to the EFFECTIVE AND FUN workouts by even throwing this one in once in a blue moon.",1350864000,14,1538,4.369718309859155
4134622,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I do this dvd in its entirety twice a week.  I have wrist problems so during the any of the work on the knees I use my Perfect Pushups-works great.  The hardest part for me is the on-the-back segment where she does the isometrics. ""Make sure you have two wrists under your back-no cheating!"".  My eyes actually water during this segment!  But I know it gets results so I work through it.  Since someone else broke it down I'll just say that my favorite excersizes are the leg swirls she does after the the segment I mentioned above, the ab workout (killer), planks and the whole on-the-knees segment.  This dvd is like Buns of Steel (which I still have) but MUCH harder.  Get ready to work.  Mix any of the other Tonique dvds with this one and you will look AWESOME.  You'll have men staring at your butt and their girlfriends giving you dirty looks because you look THAT good.  I just really love Tonique!

P.S. You can choose music only if you don't want to hear her voice.  But I find her voice motivates me so I've never done the music only.",1332979200,11,1045,4.357512953367876
4134623,5,B003L1Z33Y,"Wow, this dvd as well as Premier has got my battered old body into great shape after having children. I am finally in control of my weight thanks to the wonderful Sylwia. I feel so strong and dare I say it sexy again!
Thank you so much Sylwia!!",1332201600,5,244,4.104166666666667
4134624,1,B003L1Z33Y,I would be very careful with these exercises.  She does them so fast and I tried to keep up and ended up hurting my lower back.  Very painful!  Some of the side exercises I get no benefit from whatsover.  My favorite is still Physique 57!,1330905600,2,238,4.222222222222222
4134625,5,B003L1Z33Y,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! If you like to workout hard this one is a definite, I usually do JIllian workouts & wanted to switch it up a bit so i bought this, awesome workout. You can definitly feel this one.",1328140800,2,197,4.076923076923077
4134626,3,B003L1Z33Y,"I actually have no problem with the exercises in this dvd, but did think the workout was just ""ok"". I also agree with another reviewer about Sylvia's accent. For me, it was hard to listen to - so much that I'm not sure I will be doing this workout again.",1324166400,,254,4.1
4134627,1,B003L1Z33Y,"I have several concerns with this video compared to other instructional DVDs.  This may sound silly, but listening to the instructor with this bizarre Polish accent made me want to shut of the volume.  I also felt the exercises were kind of ""goofy"" to say the least!  There are better options out there by far!",1323820800,2,310,4.6
4134628,5,B003L1Z33Y,"i'm a workout fanatic. i'm at the gym 4-5 times a week. i do everything from runnning a 5k outdoors, spinning, bodypump, circuit training...so i guess you could say i have endurance and strength. HOWEVER! this workout totally has me falling over in pain---oh it burns!! sylvia does so many reps with little breather between moves that i'm literally cringing in agony while drenched in sweat. better believe she makes you work your tush off! her moves are straight to the point and very effective. i was looking for a workout to do at home that concentrates on inner thighs (my trouble spot) and i'm glad i bought this because sylvia totally hits the spot! i just started working out with this dvd but i have no doubt that i will have a more firm lower body in no time at all! definitely a great purchase!!!",1319068800,5,806,4.527397260273973
8399255,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I'm a new Tonique devotee! I really enjoyed this workout, and while it's long (1.5 hours), I split it up between morning and evening. I was sore the next day and when you're doing the moves with Sylwia, you wonder how she can talk and do these moves like they're nothing. The moves are barre based (at least I think they are as they are very similar to physique57 (which I LOVE love LOVE) and had me begging for mercy.  The time commitment is tough though, but you can break it up and do 2 of the segments for a 40-45 minute work out. The stretch and warm sections is one and the same and 17 minutes long. I highly recommend this workout (in fact, I loved it so much I went out and bought 5 other of her DVD's).  This is no impact, which is a plus!",1461542400,,748,4.047297297297297

8399257,5,B003L1Z33Y,"A sprained ankle led me this gem! I bought this dvd a year & a half ago but didn't really use it. Fast forward to last week when I sprained my ankle. (side note: I love exercise--running, hot yoga, jump roping, hiking, rebounding, etc. & was pretty upset about having to stop ""cold turkey."" Especially since I recently adopted a vegan WOE (thanks to Dr. McDougall) & found myself with tons of energy.) Enter the Tonique Mat workout. This injury has been a blessing in disguise. Tonique Mat is helping me to activate muscles that will help all my endeavors--sports & otherwise. Based on reviews, I also ordered the Original Buns of Steel dvd (with Greg Smithey) after previewing it on youtube. Another amazing discovery (I plan to alternate the two workouts in the upcoming weeks). Very therapeutic for a runner like me. Along with yoga & somatics, these dvd's will help me take good care of my ankles & knees long-term by developing resilient leg-hip-butt muscles (something I needed even before the sprained ankle). Both Tonique Mat & BOS are straight-forward & easy to do at home with virtually no equipment. I like Swlvia's & Greg's positive energy, sweetness, earnestness & stamina. Although I consider myself relatively athletic--both dvd's are literally kicking my butt. :-) I look forward to when I can do each workout in its entirety. My muscles burn doing just part of them! I believe these are two beneficial ingredients that will allow me to resume marathons & ultra running. Thanks Swlvia (& Greg) & best wishes to all of you in your endeavors!",1446336000,,1556,4.809701492537314

8399260,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I was looking for a mat workout without all the cheesy dance moves and this is it! It's basic stuff but you don't have to think about it... which is one of my favorite kinds of workout.  It's a killer though.  It's divided up into the different sections each are under 30 min.  In fact one part is only 17 minutes. So you can chop it up if you don't have time.  I would say it's fairly advanced in terms of endurance.  You don't get much, if any, break between exercises. It's a good challenge but still doable.  I like her workout and personality which is why I took the time to write a review.",1433980800,,595,4.130434782608695
8399261,5,B003L1Z33Y,"This was my very first Tonique workout and it was everything I had been searching for in a Mat workout and more! I really love doing leg lifts,ever since I was a Teenager and would do them in my room at night! Many mat segments on a workout DVD just don't give enough reps to feel the burn-not Sylwia-she really gives those reps! I relied on this to stay in shape after breaking my foot. I work out daily and am a workout DVD addict and there's no way I could skip workouts altogether while my foot healed. I still use this several times a week-usually I'll do a segment or two after a cardio workout. I now own all of Sylwia's workouts and this is still a fave. Sometimes I'll play my own music to forget the pain,other times I'll just zone out and embrace the pain! There is not another Mat workout to compare to this and I've tried many. While I do enjoy Cardio Mat and Energy Mat,I think this is my favorite Mat because the moves are basic and to the point. There is nothing complicated or undoable-it's like Sylwia says-it's a pure workout. Yes,the set is dull and so is the music but the moves are classic Mat and I love how she's so supportive and low key and guides you through the workout while doing all the moves with you. This is the DVD that introduced me to Sylwia and I never tire of it. I dare anyone to find a more effective Mat workout",1428710400,2,1353,4.187739463601533
8399262,5,B003L1Z33Y,"I have almost all of Sylwia's workouts, and I love this one just as much as the others. I like to do this one and Energy Mat when I'm not in the mood to do an hr+ of squats and lunges but still want a crazy challenging Tonique workout. Like the Tonique 2 DVD, this one has a somewhat distracting blue and white background, but Sylwia's clear instructions throughout and the low-key music make up for that. I don't find it monotonous, but the repetition helps me ""get in the zone."" Sylwia is sweet and energetic as usual -highly recommended if you like her other Tonique DVDs!",1412985600,,575,4.383177570093458
8399263,5,B003L1Z33Y,She is awesome,1410480000,,14,4.0
8399264,5,B003L1Z33Y,"Wow.  So I KNEW what I was getting into.  All the previous reviewers of this product warned that it would be hard.  I knew even as I looked at it and thought, ""That doesn't look that hard,"" that I was wrong and that it was harder than it looks.  But, oh my...I had no idea...it was not just hard, it was HARD!  Like, can't-get-through-a-single-exercise-without-resting HARD.  Like collapsing-in-a-sweaty-heap-at-the-end-of-an-exercise HARD.
This is such a solid and challenging pilates-mat-style strength workout, I just really am in awe of it. I think that the whole thing is just over an hour, working your entire body but mainly emphasizing the lower body with some effective ab work and push-up combinations thrown in. It is done entirely on the floor and divided into three segments: legwork on your side, a bridge series on your back and leg extensions on your knees. Of course, you can be a complete sadist like me and ATTEMPT to do the entire thing (I LOVE working my lower body more than anything else), or you can, as the instructor Sylwia suggests, just do one or two sections.
I have a HUGE collection of workout DVDs, but as far as difficulty and effectiveness go, this is the Queen of them all. You will do a LOT of reps of each exercise; she says 30.  However, she even admits that she often adds extras.  And nothing is more hope-shattering (but I know it's so good for me!) than hitting number 30 and she shouts out in her cute Polish accent, ""10 more! We're doing 40!"" Since with the side and knee exercises she works one side at a time, you may worry about over-working one leg or underworking another (HA! Underworking ANYTHING is a massive joke with this workout!) .  I've encounterd this before with other workouts and just get around it by switiching my starting leg.  One day I'll start all exercises with the right, the next the left, and switch.
Though 90% of the exercises hit your lower-body from every angle possible on a mat, there is also some short but pretty effective ab work (I definitely felt a burn in my abs and waist) and quite a few push-ups thrown in.
There is an optional warm-up/cooldown on the main menu, but as I preceed this workout with very lite cardio, I'm already warm and don't use this feature.
The production quality of the DVD, though not top-notch (and I really don't like that strange, distracting blue and white background...) is ok.  People have complained about the lack-luster dance re-mix style music, but I actually really like the music, especially the last song (maybe because it's the last song and it means I'm almost through my ordeal!).  The music has a strong, happy beat and the soundtrack changes with each section (so yes, there are only 3 ""songs"" to cover 60 minutes, which can eventually get a little annoying...when that day came, I simply lowered the volume and played my own EDM playlist...instant cure, cause when I'm doing leg lifts to the beat of a song that I LOVE, it's amazing how many more reps I can power through!!).
Sylwia herself is incredible.  She has an amazing little body and she can only be about 5'3"" at the most.  Watching her complete a whole set of exercises, with no edits, no camera cutaway, just makes me thing she's superhuman.  I love the passion and encouragement that she exudes, and I love her Polish accent!
If you can't tell, I love this workout, and though it is GRUELING, it will slim, lift and firm your lower body in particular pretty darn quickly.  I also love the fact that this will challenge me to be able to keep up more and more with each use.
Highly recommended!",1376956800,9,3581,4.624605678233438
