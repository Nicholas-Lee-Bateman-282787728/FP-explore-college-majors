7726125,3,B01DY7D3SG,"5 stars for the show, but 3 (and actually probably 2.5) for the quality. They do start the DVD's off with that warning; that it's old tape and they did what they could, but in this day and age, it seems they could have somehow captured an old show better. Some of the episodes are so dark, I can barely see what's going on. And the sound is of low quality as well. I've been waiting decades for this old favorite show of mine to come out on DVD (the music copyright was the issue, I believe), but it would have been nice if they had tried a little harder to get them in better condition.",1483574400,4,587,4.068965517241379

7726128,5,B01DY7D3SG,"This series deserves much more recognition than it has received, being a very well acted, perhaps too accurate for comfort, depiction of the life - centered on a nurse played by Dana Delany - of a military hospital during the Vietnam war.  Unlike M*A*S*H, which diluted the ugly realities of war with laughter, China Beach is all drama, with only the necessary sanitation applied to make it palatable for the television audience.  As such, it probably never received the viewership or acclaim that I would have liked.  It did, however, exist and was finally preserved on CD so I and others with my tastes can watch it again.  And again.
I can't recommend the show highly enough, it is excellent beyond belief, but I understand the topic is sensitive and the depiction perhaps too well portrayed for everybody.  If you like the intensity of Homeland, and appreciate excellent acting, give it a try, you may find yourself coming back for more.",1475625600,3,941,4.819875776397516

7726132,5,B01DY7D3SG,Great TV series.  Only complaint is that the dvd disk #1 was missing from this set?????? I do not recall ever opening a dvd set and have a disk missing.
