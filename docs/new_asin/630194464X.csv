7817372,1,630194464X,"After reading the reviews for all three ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" videos, I decided to get this one. Big mistake!!!

I know that movies usually don't compare to the books, but this was awful. So many things were changed that they should have changed the name. Throughout the movie I kept wondering if the reviewers were talking about another ""Uncle Tom's Cabin.""

If you have ever read the book, please skip this movie. It would not be worth it. Period.",1212796800,2,447,4.6455696202531644
7817373,4,630194464X,"This movie version of the book ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is a little bit different, but very interesting. A few new characters were created and introduced, and several new scenes added. The movie seems to focus a little bit more on the political situation during that time than the book itself does. The music and singing is beautiful. Recommended!",1198281600,2,342,4.913793103448276
7817374,4,630194464X,"I just finished watching this video. It's full-screen, and you wind up with half an actress' face or just someone's arm, or a voice without a body. Very annoying. And it talks about Lincoln as if this book were written after  his assasination.

Aside from that, this is well-acted and well-sung and is really pretty good. A few times one wonders about the background or history of something (where'd Simon get his scar -- and is it even important) but there's continuity, good singing, and good acting.",1147392000,,502,4.758620689655173
7817375,5,630194464X,"I just finished watching this movie last night for the first time in more than 20 years. This movie is one of the most powerful experiences form my childhood. I remember seeing this in theaters 20+ years ago - the movie even had a prologue with the author's meeting with Lincoln and the president's assassination. Widescreen was so much better than what we are offered on tape. In some instances we have to wait a few seconds for a talking person to appear on screen while on widescreen we would not have to wait at all.
This movie was filmed in Yugoslavia. I wish I had the soundtrack - especially for the Jericho and Mississippi songs.",1123718400,,637,4.5
7817376,5,630194464X,"I have had the great pleasure of reading the book Uncle Tom's Cabin.  This book moved me in many of ways to be a High School, Junior.  I have already read the book 2 times.  The movie dipction was exceptionally done.  I have seen two versions of the movie.  I could not believe it.  It was almost better than the book ROOTS.  I suggest this movie and book to all whom have not read or seen it.",981417600,9,393,4.025974025974026
