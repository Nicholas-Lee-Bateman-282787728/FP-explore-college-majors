8375149,5,B002NLU6PS,"My family and I really enjoyed this DVD.  The setting is roughly mid-twentieth century.  (The men in our family loved the vintage cars throughout the scenes.)

Slow Moe had a challenging difficulty to overcome in this story.  He was helped by the fact that he had a good relationship with his family and friends.  By chance, he found a particular invention that made his life seem easier for a while.  Eventually, he had to make a hard decision, at which point, the story continued to unfold in an impacting way.  The action throughout and the supporting cast especially made this a fun video to view.  The ending was particularly satisfying for me and gave me a good laugh.  (Also, I don't recall incidents of poor language in the DVD, although I may have missed something.)",1400025600,,775,4.681481481481481
8375150,4,B002NLU6PS,the movie arrived on time. It was a new item. I was not as pleased with the movie as I thought I would be. good one though.,1391904000,,123,3.5925925925925926
8375151,5,B002NLU6PS,"This classic film is an oldie, but a goodie.  It's not a big film but it is definitely enjoyable for the whole family.",1329609600,,118,4.130434782608695
8375152,2,B002NLU6PS,"Corny, derivative, low-budget, unrealistic children's movie that does feature some winsome child actors. Almost everything in ""Slow Moe"" reminds me of another better movie. For example, the special glasses remind me of ""Against Time"" or ""It Happens Every Spring"". Other aspects of ""Slow Moe"" remind me of ""Napoleon Dynamite"", though ""Slow Moe"" isn't nearly as funny. As for realism, Moe is called ""Slow Moe"", but he is a regular Cool Papa Bell compared to his uncle, the federal agent. His pursuit of the bad guy at the end of the movie has to set some kind of record for slowness. Nevertheless, Moe (reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite) and his two buddies (one of whom reminds me of Gary Coleman) do have an appealing way about them and young children will probably like ""Slow Moe"".",1326931200,,780,4.8283582089552235
8375153,5,B002NLU6PS,"Good family movie especially if you have Little League ballplayers in your home. The premise is a young player, who is always chosen last on teams, finds a pair of glasses that are a holdover invention from WWII. When you wear them, they give you extraordinary powers. He becomes a fantastic player, everything he ever dreamed of being. However,he comes to know that he is living a lie and it is the same as cheating. He confesses to his team what has been going on. They still believe in him which in turn helps him to believe in himself. It teaches young players the value of doing your best and your best will be good enough. I gave this as a gift to my 9 year-old grandson who loves baseball. He thoroughly enjoyed the movie as do we his grandparents. As I said it is a good movie for the whole family.",1294099200,2,806,4.309210526315789
8375154,5,B002NLU6PS,"This movie is exactly what it says it is; a low budget film that you can watch with your kids no matter what their age.  The younger kids will enjoy it at face value and the teenagers will have great time making fun of the corny parts.  Either way, the family was together and everyone had a great time for a fraction of what it would have cost to go to a movie in the theater.  All in all it's just a charming fun movie that goes out of it's way to teach some old fashioned values like honesty, bravery and loyalty.  My 4 year old loved it and keeps asking to watch it again and again.  How cool is that?",1280448000,2,605,3.9669421487603307
8375155,5,B002NLU6PS,"This new movie (not quite yet released) was given to me by a guy who came to my front door looking only for my agreement to review the movie by phone.  My wife and I enjoyed the movie and feel it is a very good kid's movie that many adults would enjoy too.  The setting was in the 1950's so there are a lot of neat old cars on display.  One element has the kid with supernatural powers which destroys the reality of the story, however I think most kids would think it was really cool and enjoy it.  The special effects with it are done well.

It is truly a family movie with no profanity of any kind or uncomfortable situations and exhibits great values and character in many ways.  It totally avoids any religious or Christian content which is really the source of those values.  The acting and video crafting is well done and I give it 5 stars for kids.",1257897600,6,855,4.208588957055214
