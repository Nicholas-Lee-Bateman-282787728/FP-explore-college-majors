It does these people a great injustice when you try to mythologize them so that they can continue to not live, not thrive, but merely exist. Honestly most of the people in the film are inconsequential, and I did not see any mystery in their customs at least not as they were displayed here. The woman with the clay and how it made her feel connected to her ancestors was personal not mystical . At the end of the day, it comes down to looks, and feelings of superiority, overriding common decency and humanity. The native people have every right to be a part of this new society created by it's invaders, and they should be allowed to seek and find their own levels in it unhindered. After all if  you scratch the surface just think of all the inconsequential people that you will find in the larger society who haven't been mythologized and are allowed to lead lives unencumbered.",1508371200,,946,4.5

8661741,5,B00KU3Y5HQ,"Sensitive and detailed portrait of the difficulties of transitioning from a deeply relational and spiritual culture to a western culture dominated by money, video games, and alcohol.  I was so impressed with the psychological maturity and sophistication of the tribal leaders in understanding their people and working to mitigate the damage of the collision with western culture.",1460419200,,379,5.649122807017544
