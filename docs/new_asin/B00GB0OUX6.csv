6068998,5,B00GB0OUX6,"I like it. It's always fun with ""extras"" for good anime series.
I don't think I can say more then that. Except, if you have not seen 'Girls und Panzer'. Then you have really missed something good ;).",1395446400,,199,4.2631578947368425
6068999,1,B00GB0OUX6,"nothing here to see.

some voyeurism, a mild attempt for character development and no tank battles.

not worth the money that I spend",1393891200,6,133,4.739130434782608
6069000,3,B00GB0OUX6,"I hate to have to agree with any negative review of the Girls Und Panzer series, but I have to with this.  The girls are charming, and it was fun to watch, but I really expected the battle with Anzio to be in this collection.  For the price, I really felt cheated on this.

I do not understand why the producers put this out; I don't like to think that it was just for a quick buck, but it seems that maybe it was.  Does anyone know if the battle with Anzio was even filmed?,  If it was, why didn't they put it on this collection?  Why reference it in the main series and never show it?

ahhh, time for some sake. :(",1393891200,8,616,3.959349593495935
6069001,3,B00GB0OUX6,"I found Girls und Panzer to be a charming and surprisingly involving series. It could have gone in many ways including, fan service or even comedy. It didn't. Well here's the silly stuff that didn't make it. This is about 45 minutes of content in six episodes of varying length. The ankou dance is about 3 minutes but some are nine minutes. Really this is an unnecessary spend on what should have been extras on the series. If you are totally besotted with the series then buy this. For anyone else I'd suggest waiting for a SAVE edition with these added.",1393718400,16,555,4.5049504950495045
6069005,3,B00GB0OUX6,Not like the original serires. Hardly any tanks and too much fan service.,1448064000,2,73,4.6923076923076925

6069007,5,B00GB0OUX6,This an amazing and funny show. Extra attention to detail in the tanks themselves makes it very worth while.,1438473600,,108,4.7368421052631575

6069012,5,B00GB0OUX6,If you are fan of the series it has some humourous episodes but is a bit too fan service for a series that excels in all other ways.  It is also missing the Anzio battle episode which they will hopefully bring out in the future on blu-ray.  They need to do more season's!,1428364800,2,271,4.09433962264151
6069013,5,B00GB0OUX6,"Others?  Not so much.  I agree with those who complain that this DVD should have been included with the 3 DVD's of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girls-und-Panzer-TV-Collection/dp/B00EZ228FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girls und Panzer: TV Collection</a>, but it is what it is.

There are three must see episodes for TV series fans.  One explains (to the extent that is even possible) why all of the schools are built on aircraft carriers, another provides a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the match against Pravda, and the third has the various Oarai teams competing in a genuinely funny hidden talent contest that requires them to use something other than the talents they are best known for. There are also a couple of episodes where the cast spends most of their time wearing bathing suits for those interested in that kind of stuff while the Dance episode was merely disturbing (but at least mercifully short).

Note: A new OVA episode has been released in Japan but not yet here, entitled ""This is the Real Anzio Battle!"" Set just prior to the ending of TV episode 7, this depicts the full story of the battle with Anzio that until now had taken place offstage.

Note: For those interested in a chronological listing of TV and OVA episodes combined, here is my best guess:

From internal evidence OVA episodes 1 and 2, in that order (because the swimsuits purchased in the first are still being worn in the second) take place before the first tournament match, which means between TV episodes 4 and 5.

From internal evidence OVA episode 3 must take place after Yukari's reconnaissance mission before the Saunders match in TV episode 5 (and arguably after the Saunders match itself in TV episode 6) and before the hunt for more tanks in the latter half of TV episode 7, so I place it at around the halfway point of TV episode 7, well before the Anzio match at the very end of TV episode 7, which is expanded in OVA episode 7.

OVA episode 4, which includes the Hall Monitors but no later joining teams in a costumed, Oarai set performance of the Angler Fish Dance of Shame, must take place sometime between their joining in TV episode 7 and the other teams joining in TV episode 10.  Since exactly these girls performed exactly this dance, albeit in their competition uniforms on the field of battle during the match with Pravda in TV episode 9, the logical conclusion is that this was a commemorative performance of what was now a Dance of Defiance, taking place during TV episode 10 after returning to Oarai victorious.

OVA episode 5 is a longer, more detailed version of the battle winning reconnaissance mission during the TV episode 9 match against Pravda.

OVA episode 6 is the tale of what happened at the victory banquet after TV episode 12.

6069014,2,B00GB0OUX6,"The original series is great fun, presenting quite a coherent story. These ""specials"" are a a feeble attempt to cash in on that, the most grating aspect being the ill-judged ""humour"" of most of theepisodes.",1415491200,2,206,4.914285714285715

6069047,4,B00GB0OUX6,"Excellent show!
A brilliant, if strange, take on the ""sports anime"" genre. Instead of baseball, or judo there are high school tank battles, and instead of awkward young men there are cute girls learning the 'sport'.
Regarding the English dub, it starts off rough, but by episode three is very solid and there is some excellent voice talent here that adds to the  experience. Sadly one of the original songs was not available due to copyright issues and was replaced with generic accordion music. Aside from that disappointment, this is a superb show.",1408233600,,550,4.913978494623656
