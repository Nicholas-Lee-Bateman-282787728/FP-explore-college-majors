3447893,1,B001AGPSLY,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this movie.  The animation and voices are terrible.  The story line is not even close to as good as the other movies. The Holly Hobbie series has been my girls favorite, but now I don't think we will buy them anymore.  They are not worth the money if they continue to make them like this.  Does anyone know who we could send a formal complaint too?",1218931200,10,390,4.22972972972973
3447894,1,B001AGPSLY,"The movie was a big let down, the voice talent and animation is a lot lower quality then the original movies, and songs were horrible.

Plus the new girl Porcha is a spoiled rich girl who is mean to Carrie and Amy through most of both movies.  I had bought it for my nieces but they started to mimic the movie by calling people goobers so we do not let them watch it any more.",1218844800,4,376,4.0
3447895,1,B001AGPSLY,"Different voices, different animation, and poor story lines. My family and I  loved the previous Holly movies. This one was terrible. Rent if you must but wait to buy it.",1218499200,12,170,4.666666666666667
3447896,1,B001AGPSLY,"I just want to thank everyone who took the time to write a review, I was getting ready to do some Christmas shopping and was so excited for a new Holly hobbie release! I am so glad that I did not find this in a store because I would have bought it without hesitaion and been so disappointed.
My family has loved the series and there is no need to change them! What a disappointment with the many changes! I will not be buying this one after all!",1226793600,,445,4.068181818181818
3447897,1,B001AGPSLY,"My daugher and I just watched this movie and it was bad.  I agree with the other reviews.  The voices are all wrong and the songs don't even go with the story.  Singing voices are not the same as the talking ones and it is very obvious.  WOW.  We are really unhappy as we loved the previous movies.  Why change a good thing? Oh well, they need to bring back the original cast.",1223856000,,376,4.082191780821918
3447898,1,B001AGPSLY,"We have ALL of the Holly Hobbie dvds and this one was SUCH a disappointment.  I read a previous review that said her 5 yr old noticed the difference- well my 5 year old did and walk out to go play in her room!  She LOVES Holly Hobbie and she walked out 5 mins into this one.  I feel jipped!  She just keeps saying ""Mommy, it's different.  They all sound different.""

POOR animation, POOR voicing, POOR song choices, POOR writing! HUGE disappointment.  I do NOT recommend this movie at all!",1222905600,,489,4.366666666666666
3447899,1,B001AGPSLY,"All of the previous Holly Hobbie and Friends movies were great, but this one was really disappointing and didn't have the same feel at all. Different voices, new annoying character introduced, and just wasn't very good in general. If this is what the rest of the movies will be like, I wouldn't suggest watching them, let alone buying them.",1221782400,3,340,4.779661016949152
3447900,1,B001AGPSLY,"I agree with the other reviews. This DVD was a big disappointment for us. I like the Hollie Hobbie DVDs because they appeal to my older daughter without having the sassy attitude of other ""older"" kids shows. (iCarly, et al). Not only was the story very disjointed but the innocence wasn't quite there. The voices were annoying--especially when ""Hollie"" sings (the songs on the other DVDs are good!). My kids like it, but not as much as the previous DVDs.",1219795200,5,454,4.6875
3447901,1,B001AGPSLY,"My kids were so disappointed when we popped the newest adventure from Holly Hobbie into the DVD player last night for the first time, and we heard the voice of Holly Hobbie. My 5 year old noticed right away and said ""That is a different voice."" Everything is just terrible about this DVD, they have changed the voices, the songs are awful and don't even sound like they are sung by the character who is voicing Holly Hobbie, it sounded more like a young boy's voice to me. The original Holly Hobbie voices were wonderful and we loved all of them. The Christmas adventure is the all time favorite at our house. The animation in this one is horrendous, the new girl is drawn to look like the one of the Pokemon characters,just take a look at her eyes. The whole show screams poor quality animation.  You can tell they went cheap with them and they must have thought no one would notice the subpar effects, the different voices and the shoddy storyline. Well, this family noticed and we will  not be buying into the Holly HObbie franchise again. I am so glad the other reviewers feel the same way, maybe the producers will wake up and go back to the original cast.",1219708800,4,1161,4.446009389671362
3447902,1,B001AGPSLY,"Horrible storyline, terrible new character, shoddy animation and voicework - I think this one is going to get ""lost"" so my girls don't absorb the poor quality and message of this movie. It's a real shame because, while I found the other Holly movies saccharine, they were beloved by my three girls and I though they were a nice addition to our DVD library. This one? Notatall.",1219190400,3,376,4.626865671641791
3447903,1,B001AGPSLY,"The other four Holly Hobbie stories were excellent, my kids adore them. This one is awful in comparison. New voices, shoddy animation and stupid songs. If there are going to be any more Holly Hobbie animated films, the next one better be great to make up for this one.",1219190400,4,268,4.489795918367347
3447904,1,B001AGPSLY,"My niece who absolutely loves the Holly Hobbie movies was very disappointed and so was I. They changed all the voices of the characters and the animation was off. I don't know what they were thinking. It's just an awful show to watch. Were they trying for a carton on TV or what? 2 short episodes. If this is the future for the Holly Hobbie movies I will not waste my money and my nieces time.

Just my two cents and then some.",1219017600,10,427,4.144578313253012
3447905,1,B001AGPSLY,"I have to say my wife and I are pretty disappointed with the latest release in the Holly Hobbie series Fabulous Fashion Show. The animation is not as crisp and clear. The voices for ALL of the characters changed so much my kids got up mid way and stopped watching the DVD. The story line is  way off from previous story lines. It lost its warm, happy, helpful theme that was so prevalent in the previous series.  If this continues to be the new direction of the series I doubt my wife and I will purchase any more of the Holly Hobbie Adventures.",1218931200,4,545,4.281553398058253
8277334,1,B001AGPSLY,My girls love Holly Hobbie but did not like this video. The voices are different from the other videos and it just did not meet the same quality story line.,1508889600,,156,4.233333333333333
8277335,5,B001AGPSLY,My daughter really got into Holly hobbies. The voices aren't the same as in the others and that threw her off a little. I actually didn't mind watching the others with her. But this one just wasn't as good,1463961600,,205,4.282051282051282

8277338,5,B001AGPSLY,My kids LOVE the Holly Hobby Movies!  They have 6 so far.  I am wondering if there are more movies to purchase?,1382486400,,111,4.0
8277339,5,B001AGPSLY,"We rented this before buying based on all the other reviews, I am glad we gave this show a shot. My daughter loves all the Holly Hobbie movies and this is no exception. In fact she wanted to watch it again after it was over. Adults might not enjoy this but my 6 year old daughter sure did. Do not be afraid to give this dvd a chance.",1238371200,,333,3.911764705882353
8277340,1,B001AGPSLY,"I agree with everyone else, what have they done!!!  I loved all the movies untill voices changed (very bad now) adn the quality of the whole production went down the tubes.  It is so sad!!!  I am trying to find out who at Sony to give the feedback to, hope it is not to late (probably) to change it all back!!!!!!",1234051200,,313,4.098360655737705
8277341,1,B001AGPSLY,"Well, I disregarded Best Friends Forever in hoping that it was a one time mistake on the producers' part. Well, no. Best Friends Forever is bad in my book (do we really a story involving heartless politicians and dumb ironies? The girls worked so hard to save the house and it got destroyed by a storm in the end anyway. I found that extremely daft) but this one's way worse. The animation quality was noticeably worse, girls act out of character (since when is Holly easy to push around?), the plot was weak (was the introduction of that new girl, Portia, with the personality of a cheesecake, really called for? Trying to shoehorn her into the story totally created numerous plotholes in the backstory of the entire franchise. And the emphasis on fashion thing just doesn't work for me) and worse of all, they had to completely change the cast (what's wrong with just renewing Alyson Stoner's contract?), and they didn't even do a good job at that. A lot of the characters just sound irritatingly awkward in their new voices. The worst part was that the singer of the songs not only doesn't match Holly's voice, but the singing itself is extremely horrible and the singer sounded way older than Holly is.

The writers better shape up. I've lost faith in Holly after watching this.",1233792000,,1282,4.672566371681416
8277342,1,B001AGPSLY,"We've thoroughly enjoyed the previous Holly Hobbie shows - good voices, good story, good animation.  This DVD isn't anywhere near the quality of the others.  They changed all the voices, threw together the animation, weren't true to the heart of the characters or the quality plot lines.  Wish I could return it - my 7 years old was so unhappy, and so was I.  If this is the direction they are taking the Holly Hobbie shows then I won't purchase anymore!",1233619200,,454,4.567901234567901
8277343,3,B001AGPSLY,"My 4 year old enjoys this Holly Hobbie movie. I don't think it will be one of her favorites. Part of this movie takes place in New York City, so she doesn't relate to it as well as she did the previous movies that are in a rural setting. Several of the charecters had different voices that the previous movies so this deminished the continuity of the Holly Hobby Series. All in all it is still a cute movie.",1231200000,,407,4.1645569620253164
