A group of friends attempt to resurrect their dead friend while causing all sorts of chaos along the way.  This sequel to the fantastic original film successfully exceeds its predecessor in terms of an even higher energy level and even better scriptwriting.  The constant attention to detail and wild flashbacks return with a vengeance, along with a plethora of new bells and whistles - including, but not limited to, a great baseball game showdown, Chiaki Kuriyama, and zombies!  The scriptwriting is a great showcase of quirky, intelligent Japanese comedy because it demands a constant attention to detail as it peppers an endless assault of creative scenarios and quick one-liners at the viewer.  Some of the most interesting moments revolve around an initially incomprehensible moment, after which the camera will flash back to a previously unforeseen event that not only sheds light on the reasoning behind a particular character's actions, but also provides a gut-busting moment of hilarity.  The pace is blistering and relentless in this surprisingly awesome comedy that's a spin-off of a television series.

This high octane laugh-fest has unquestionably earned a place amongst the best comedies ever made.",1258502400,6,1323,5.271428571428571
