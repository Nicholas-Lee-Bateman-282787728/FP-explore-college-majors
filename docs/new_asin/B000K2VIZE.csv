8154087,1,B000K2VIZE,I found the actual segments on the Icelandic horse beautiful but there were too many scenes with the host that were painful to watch. He seemed unprepared to understand the culture -- the worst part when he sidetracks from the horses to make fun of Icelanders' belief in hidden people. I was also disappointed in how little information was presented about the horses considering the length of the video. It came across as a slapdash and amateurish production.,1209254400,8,459,4.897435897435898
8154088,5,B000K2VIZE,I brought my Mom on a trip to Iceland last year.  She kept saying how much she loves to think back on the trip so I purchased this for her.  She says she looks at it often and feels like she's back in Reykjavik.,1180828800,4,211,3.772727272727273
