8196258,4,B000QGDXH0,I love these classics from the 60s 70s.  Not pornagraphic but just the b story lines that really shed some light on cultures and where really bad carpet and furniture come.  You have to be an aficionado of the era to appreciate the film.,1424390400,3,237,4.363636363636363
8196259,3,B000QGDXH0,The cover is tasteless and not as pretty as the version I have but the inside is naturally what matters. Go find a clip of it. Rika Aoki is still kickin'.,1423612800,,154,4.0
8196260,5,B000QGDXH0,"DVD Review: All you get is the movie and some stupid trailers of all these Italian porn. Overall, it's fine.

Movie Review: Rica Aoki IS A HOT CHICK!! Some people may say she's ugly but who cares what they think. She has a nice round, curvy, plump butt. AND THAT'S IT!! That's the reason why I got this movie and that's because of Rica's butt. SO UP YOURS!! The movie is sort of hard to follow but that is expected from these Pinky Violence films but I found this movie to be wonderful with Rica's butt, other naked women, the blood spurting mayhem and so forth.

Conclusion: A fun film for Pinky Violence fans. 4 1/2 for the movie and 4 1/2 for the DVD despite a lack of extras.",1417219200,4,679,4.2153846153846155
8196261,3,B000QGDXH0,"Some good scenes. Good acting Not the most beautiful actress but a nice look and more realistic body. For the price paid, it was entertaining.",1412121600,,142,4.72
8196262,4,B000QGDXH0,"If you are a fan of ""Pinky Violence"" and enjoyed films such as these series: ""Sasori"", ""Sukeban"", ""Delinquent Girl Boss"" and even the films ""Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs"" and ""Criminal Woman: Killing Melody"", then the ""Rica"" trilogy delivers. The first film is the most raunchy of the trilogy, but all three films are worth owning. I was laughing so hard when Rika Aoki was dancing in the hostess bar. OMG! It is so funny and over the top. The company, Media Blasters going under the name ""Exploitation Digital"", released all three films in a box set as well. Must-buy!!!",1270339200,4,568,4.747474747474747
8196263,3,B000QGDXH0,"I picked this this movie up based on the fact that it was made in 1972 at the height of the ""Pinky Violence"" era in Japan. Every time one of these gets released (and more and more are these days) I snatch it up hoping that it will be as good as, say, Female Convict Scorpion: Beast Stable. It is not. It's more of a generic Sukeban flick that's more along the lines of Girl Boss Guerilla and Criminal Woman: Killing Melody. That said, it's still highly enjoyable. It has all the requisite exploitation, nudity and violence you expect from one of these films. The one thing it lacks that the best of these films has is STYLE. It has neither the radical camerawork and surreal touches of the Scorpion movies or the black humour of Teruo Ishi's Female Yakuza Tale. It's pretty straightforward. Also, Rika Aoki is a very odd looking woman. Not quite beautiful but very sexy and what she lacks in acting technique she makes up for in pure intensity. She's out for revenge and looks like she means it. She wears go go boots very well and her thighs look as if they'd crush your skull. She also sings the opening theme song. The plot is pretty standard and nothing we haven't seen before. There are trailers for two other Rica movies (it's a trilogy!) on this otherwise bare bones disc and I wonder if Exploitation Digital is planning to put those out as well. If they do, I hope they take a little more care with the remastering. The film looks ok but they could do a lot better. So no, this isn't a Pinky Violence Classic but I have to admit I'm a whore for this genre. I'll probably get the other two movies too. They're like crack.",1187308800,20,1628,4.358552631578948
