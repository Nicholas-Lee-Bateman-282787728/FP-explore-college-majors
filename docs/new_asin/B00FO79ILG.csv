6016170,5,B00FO79ILG,Great DVD that includes many classic performances as well as interviews with family and friends. The friends I shared it with were truly impressed.,1353974400,,147,5.166666666666667
6016171,4,B00FO79ILG,"When Bing Crosby first burst upon the public scene (in the 1920s), he was a singing star comparable to Madonna & Adeale combined.  He maintained his popularity until his death.  This dvd is a selection of his TV christmas shows with Bing singing with his megastar-mostly from the golden age of movies-guests.  If you enjoy Bing, I can recommend this dvd.",1341619200,2,354,4.770491803278689
6016172,4,B00FO79ILG,"I very much enjoyed this tape which is a sampling of some of Bing's best TV performances including several of his best songs.  My one proviso is that, although I enjoyed the commentaries by Bing's wife, daughter,  Michael Feinstein, and Andy Williams, I wish they could have been made background or extra.  After  having once seen them, I wish it were possible to just listen to the performances.  Still, a wonderful DVD.",1327276800,,421,4.791666666666667
6016173,5,B00FO79ILG,"Der Bingle did not let me down.  The clips of his specials, and other bits, were exceptional entertainment.  I especially loved the segment of Jose Feliciano performing sounds of various instruments with his guitar.  What a great show of talent that was.  Bing's other guests were a great pleasure as well, and I haven't even seen all of the bonus features yet.  A big hand also to the technicians who put this DVD together.  The visuals and audios were first class.  For a Bing Crosby fan this is like visiting heaven.  Thank you Bing and all.  Diane Barrie",1303948800,6,558,4.612244897959184
6016174,4,B00FO79ILG,"This is a documentary, in that there are people, including Bing's wife, talking in between every complete song on the DVD, but it is more than worth listening to them to be able to watch and hear this icon sing, mostly with guests from various tv shows.",1293408000,10,253,4.404255319148936
6016175,5,B00FO79ILG,"This is an excellent release and this is what is included (original broadcast dates in brackets).

""I Love Paris"" (3 January, 1954) - ""Swanee"" (1 October, 1958) - ""Ol' Man River"" (2 March, 1959) - Medley (using special effect showing three Bings - ""Pennies from Heaven"" - ""June in January"" - ""I'm an Old Cowhand"" - ""Play a Simple Melody"" - 5 October, 1960) - ""Now You Has Jazz"" (with Louis Armstrong - 13 October, 1957) ""Mama Don't Allow It"" (with Jose Feliciano - 23 October, 1968) - ""One Little Word - Married"" (with Carol Burnett - 17 December, 1969) - ""It Had to Be You"" (3 January, 1954) - ""I Believe in You"" (with Bob Hope - 15 February, 1964) - ""The Oldest Established"" (with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin - 15 February, 1964) ""Sing"" (with Fred Astaire - 3 December, 1975) - ""Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral"" (Bing sings to Regis Philbin - 25 October, 1967) - ""Pennies from Heaven"" (Regis sings to Bing - 25 October, 1967) - ""Swinging on a Star"" (with Andy Williams - 30 October, 1966) - ""Where the Blue of the Night"" (11 June, 1970) - ""The Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth"" (with David Bowie - 30 November, 1977) - ""White Christmas"" (three clips of Bing at different points in career - 11 December, 1961 - 14 December, 1971 and 30 November, 1977)

The quality of the clips is generally excellent and only Bing singing ""Swanee"" from his October 1, 1958 special falls under this standard. Many of us are familiar with Bing singing ""Now You Has Jazz"" from the Edsel Show but it's never looked so good before. It's like watching it for the first time! The linking chat between the songs is first class with Mary Crosby giving a potted history of Bing's life up to the TV years. Leonard Maltin and Michael Feinstein come in frequently with enthusiastic and complimentary comments. Indeed, Mr. Maltin expresses the thought that listening to Bing was the equivalent of comfort food. Kathryn Crosby provides useful additions to the overall package and it is interesting to hear her say that David Bowie was a little scared about singing ""The Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth"" as he was worried about the key. However Bing encouraged him gently to ""take a shot at it"" saying he would come in somewhere.
Regis Philbin says that listening to Bing on the radio as a youth made him think that Bing was his friend, which is probably something to which we can all attest. Regis described his first meeting with Bing on the Joey Bishop show in 1967 and we heard a sound clip of Bing singing ""Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral"" to Regis on the show and part of Mr. Philbin's response with ""Pennies from Heaven"".
Andy Williams makes many gracious remarks about Bing, saying that he was the first real pop singer. He also recalls recording ""Swinging on a Star"" with him in 1944 and says what a huge thrill it was for him to sing with Bing on his TV show in 1966.
I had never seen ""Married"" with Carol Burnett before although I had heard an audio version. What was completely new to me was the black and white version of Bing singing ""Where the Blue of the Night"" from the June 1970 Buenos Aires TV telethon in which Bing and Kathryn participated. It had never been aired outside Argentina before.
The extras on the DVD include Bing singing ""White Christmas"" on the same Buenos Aires TV telethon and other clips such as ""Joshua"" with The Crosby brothers, Bing and Dino singing a medley from 1958 and Maurice Chevalier joinging Mr. Crosby in ""Alouette"" on a 1961 show.

This is an excellent production from Robert Bader and all Crosby fans need to have this.",1290124800,36,3525,4.592063492063492
6016176,5,B00FO79ILG,"The Legendary Bing Crosby is a beautiful tribute to the single most influential singer of the 20th century. Bing was a legend indeed! He was the first to sing in this wonderful, popular style. In fact, Bing created it! Bing actually started pop music! Everyone else admittedly copied Bing.

This lovely PBS special is full of scenes from his 30 television specials, including the very famous duet he performed with rock singer David Bowie on the very last Christmas special Bing taped for us before his untimely death on October 14, 1977. The program aired after Bing left us.

What I enjoy most, besides Bing's singing, are the comments by Bing's widow, Kathryn Crosby and his only daughter, the lovely Mary Francis Crosby-Brodka.

It's very nice to have this PBS tribute to the greatest singer who ever lived without all the fund drive breaks we normally see during programs like this. Well worth the money!

Thank You, Alice Kane",1286409600,33,932,4.8427672955974845
