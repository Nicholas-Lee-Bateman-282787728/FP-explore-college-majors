4092248,5,B0038T56KE,"excellent documentary.  maybe the causes for detroit's descent include free trade agreements making it easier to move automobile production overseas and the increasing entrance of foreign competition into the american market.  when the corruption exists at every level, and so many profit and grow prosperous off of addiction and killing, solutions are hard to come by.",1472342400,,369,5.571428571428571

4092252,5,B0038T56KE,"This documentary gives an in depth account from the Detroit film-maker/researcher, Al Profit, of how the demise of Detroit's pre-bankruptcy economy conicided with the rise of a mamoth illicit drug trade economy along with the range of violence and street smarts employed to support and maintain it.

8391754,4,B0038T56KE,"I liked this because I like history. The content was good and the effort was noble. The thing that got me was the editing. I got lost sometimes, not knowing who was being spoken about. All in all, a good bit of truth to watch. Detroit still needs help, cocaine doesn't grow or get processed in America, but the flow of it is unstoppable. For places that have not economic prosperity or hope somehow these drugs still find there way there. Last time I checked, the poverty stricken don't own any boats or planes. This film will give you a snapshot of what can happen in any ghetto near YOU.",1514678400,,589,4.363636363636363
