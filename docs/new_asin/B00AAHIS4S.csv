8549173,3,B00AAHIS4S,"The Confrontation is a weird movie only in the sense that it feels like it's fighting itself. It's against communism but it's for communism. It's against the police but it's for them. The movie kind of goes on like this for forever but in song. Miklos Jancso has chosen a 60s hippie sing in at a college to stage the debate. So, the film takes the form of an odd musical where a students union made of young mostly attractive people in colorful clothing stump for some kind euro-style democratic socialism. I realize this sounds kind of weak. They're not out there demanding an end to everything and a small government setup. However, in a country where you could get killed for saying that normally and not just for doing it in song it's a big provocation.

The movie is interesting. You can see him doing things for the censors while at the same time doing his best to get his message across that being a satellite nation for the Russians to leech wealth and youth off of for a totalitarian regime might not be the best thing. He can't say definitely or he'll get shot. Even with all this Jancso is still even handed. He points out that a lot of people who never had power now have it under communism. He then points out some of them are to bitter to have it responsibly.

I can't say I like the movie. It's a really odd 70 minute experience. Same time, I can't think of anything else like it. So, if anything, it's worth it for the uniqueness of it all.",1507680000,,1456,4.349264705882353
