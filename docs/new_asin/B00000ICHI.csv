1220846,5,B00000ICHI,"I recently purchased the Brave Little Toaster for my son who begged for the movie.  He has watched the other ""Toaster"" movies and has loved them!  After receiving the movie from amazon.com, my son has watched this movie every day for about a week and has not stopped talking about it!  He loves the animals and the song the animals sing about meeting Rob.  I also have watched the movie and find in it many examples of how to be considerate and caring to humans, animals, as well as your appliances!  It rocks!",1011139200,6,510,4.440860215053763
1220847,1,B00000ICHI,"The first movie was cute, and my boy liked it a lot.  Within a few minutes into this sequel, we have: a save the animals song, a save the appliances song, a boyfriend forgets anniversary, an evil co-worker, a lost  dissertation, lots of talk.  The thing is about a talking toaster, for  heaven's sake!  After a few minutes, my 3 year old boy asked me to put on  The Iron Giant, which he has seen about 30 times now.  We never went back  to BLT to the R again...",949622400,5,461,4.101123595505618

1220862,1,B00000ICHI,"Started this one thinking it was the original movie. After 30 seconds we realized it wasn't, but continued to give it a chance. We made it like 10 minutes in and couldn't deal...it was terrible.",1489708800,,194,4.571428571428571
1220863,3,B00000ICHI,Most sequels don't quite live up to the original and this is no exception.  The story isn't something I found very interesting or intriguing and and my kids though they watched it all the way through don't care for it either.  It was okay to pass the time with something different to watch but it isn't going to be something we continue to enjoy again and again like most Disney movies.,1487980800,,386,4.422535211267606

1220967,4,B00000ICHI,"The characters are all working and playing together, that is the nicest best thing about this cartoon. They help each other. They work with other appliances or furniture to help their human and the animals, so that you feel happy and safe inside. In this picture, they worked with the big tube computer to save the beautiful animals from lab research and found their humans thesis which had been lost on his labtop. I like the toaster's voice, it is so pretty. The radio gave up his life for another. I felt sad when he gave his battery up because he was so hurt by his friends inability to understand or forgive his actions when he clearly showed he was hurt. That part is not so good. He gave his little life up and he was so full of playfulness and energy and he wanted to help. Its just characters get mischievous and act out or are in struggles. Which is a reflection of real life. I just loved the safty of their togetherness, they could be themselves and the blanket and how much he wants to comfort, their safe feeling of energy. I also really like the vacumn because he reminds me of an eeyore. The monkey was sweet too and had a grandfather voice. I also found out that whatever is in a computer is always there and if you find the right person or information, you can retrieve whats lost, since my favorites were lost.",1343347200,,1329,4.362903225806452

1220990,5,B00000ICHI,This movie was the second of a 3-series about these little appliances who loved their master enough to follow him to college. It shows the obstacles they faced and how they got past them. It shows how friends look out for each other and don't give up on their mission. My 4-yr-old granddaughter really likes these movies.,1301270400,,321,4.649122807017544

1220994,2,B00000ICHI,"I recently watched this with my 3 year old son and was mostly disappointed.  The film doesn't display any real heart or creativity to make it stand out and I doubt this one will garner any repeat viewings.  It felt like a second rate Saturday morning cartoon rather than a movie in terms of the animation and overall production quality.  The story is an odd mix of wacky pratfall antics, serious subject matter like animal cruelty, and left-field songs about things like the internet (seriously, no kidding).  This film just pales in comparison to releases from Pixar or most of Disney's other major movie projects, and isn't even on par with other more creative TV programs for kids like Charlie & Lola or Little Einsteins.  Not recommended.",1220572800,,742,4.811023622047244

1220997,5,B00000ICHI,"This movie is good on several counts. First, it may be the third installment in the Brave Little Toaster trilogy, but it's obviously intended to be inserted between the original and ""Mars,"" to tie together the Master's departure for college and his marriage to Chris/fatherhood to Rob, Jr. in ""Mars."" That development seemed to come much too soon, leaving us to wonder just what occurred in between. This movie carries a wonderful message about animals and their rights, focusing rather heavily on a snake named Mergatroid, a devoted white mother cat named Maisie, a disaffected rat named Ratzo, an elderly ape named Sebastian, and a sweet Chihuahua named Alberto. The music in this movie is extremely good for a sequel. We're introduced to some new appliances as well; a modem, female computer, some printers, a security camera in the police Dobermans' pen. On the whole, the main characters retain their personalities true to form, but don't have quite enough funny or poignant lines to allow this to come close to matching its original. Not that anything ever could. This is a worthy sequel. The Master is studying to be a veterinarian, a suitable profession. The interaction of appliances and animals is interesting.

Oh, and let's not forget Wittgenschtein, the old super-computer! This movie was obviously planned before ""Mars,"" because it explains how he came to live in the museum. Brian Doyle-Murray does a great job as the voice of this funny, nice guy. And it's a touching moment when Radio sacrifices his own WFC-11-12-55 tube to save him. The Toaster hasn't been the only brave one throughout these movies. The others have done some pretty brave things themselves.

Overall, not a bad sequel at all. In fact, in my humble opinion this trilogy ranks right up there with Lord of the Rings; you've got the Brave Little Toaster: The Fellowship of the Office Chair, The Two Rescues, & Return From Mars.",1089331200,7,1910,4.947040498442368
1220998,3,B00000ICHI,"Looking for something to entertain the kids on a wet night? This installment of the Toaster series will fit the bill quite nicely. Although it's not as well written, directed or produced as the first film (or even the second), To The Rescue does deal with a number of moral issues and difficult decisions that the Toaster and his pals have to make to save the life of some lab animals.
More of a slapdash affair than the first film (or, in my opinion, the convoluted sequel), Rescue is a poor relation to the original film. THe characterizations and conflicts are still strong and suspenseful but the plotting is sloppy. Most younger children won't notice but a few older ones might. Luckily, kids can suspend their disbelief a lot easier than adults.
Kids won't pay attention to the quality of animation as much as adults and the gaps in the plot probably won't be an issue. The songs are entertaining and almost to the quality of the first film. The best vocal performance comes from Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Murray's brother and another Saturday Night Live/Second City alum) as the computer. His distinctive gravelly voice and performance add quality to this average sequel.
Just a note for parents this is the second film in the Toaster series. It was planned and written after the third film Goes To Mars and is the only one in the series not inspired by Thomas Disch's children's stories.",1048896000,,1394,4.7407407407407405
1220999,4,B00000ICHI,"Taking place when the master Rob is finishing his university thesis, this is the second installment in the Toaster saga.  As a discerning teenage fan of the Toaster series, I was expecting this to be a crass, contrived money grab capitalizing on the first two movies that were based on Thomas M. Disch's books.
Well, I was wrong.  This movie probably does have the weakest plot line of all the Toaster movies, but the themes of friendship, teamwork and caring for animals are well illustrated.  The songs are fun and the animation is much better than the cover art would lead you to believe (esp. in the song about the internet).
My only complaint is only that the story focusses more on the animals than I would have liked to see.  The Toaster takes less of a role in this movie than Radio!  It was nice however to see the usual cruel and sarcastic Radio following the example of Toaster.
If your kids liked the other Toaster movies, they will most likely enjoy this one too.  And for those of you like me who used to watch the first one over and over again when you were 6, you'll find yourself smiling as you watch this one too.",1047254400,3,1131,4.413461538461538
