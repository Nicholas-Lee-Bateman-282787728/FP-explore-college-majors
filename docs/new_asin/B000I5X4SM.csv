8144041,1,B000I5X4SM,I made a mistake by not reading all the information and ordered a European version so I couldn't play it. Im sure the CD is wonderful but until I get one that I can play I won't know.,1410220800,3,183,3.8421052631578947
8144042,5,B000I5X4SM,Received in perfect condition well ahead of expected delivery date!  We had recently purchased a alltegions DVD  player so I can again FINALLY use one of my favorite step aerobic workouts!  Too bad no one at CBS/Fox understands how well this would sell if it was released as region 1.,1408752000,6,284,4.64
