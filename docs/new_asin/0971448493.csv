173753,4,0971448493,"Dan (director) does a marvelous job or creating some really wonderful scenes in a life opening indie film.  Dan has a real touch when it comes to creating scenes that give the viewer real insights into the character.  One of my favorite scenes is Daniel going to and from his office.  Each time he trudges up the hill he carries more and more files etc. until his little cart, rolls over from the burden into the street.  Another favorite scene is the creditors coming to the door.  The casting is great and the actors are very convincing.  Dan wrote, directed and plays the lead character no easy feat.  But, he pulls it off well.  The transformation of Daniel is a life opening experience that shows the power of Buddhism in a well crafted manner.",1151280000,2,749,4.537313432835821
173754,5,0971448493,"This film kept my interest throughout. Dan, as a lawyer really had to deal with a lot! The way his clients were depicted was a real eye opener!

Between his professional life and his personal life, Daniel really was walking a tightrope. The film depicts very well what can happen when we have too much going on in our lives

I was left with a feeling of admiration for what they all went through and the outcome.

I would recommend it to anyone especially those that are going through tough times.",1139616000,2,497,4.43956043956044
173755,3,0971448493,"The spiritual journey of Daniel Coplan unfolds much like the spiritual journey that many of us find ourselves on: Confusing, painful, humorous and inspirational, anything but boring.  Echos of Enlightenment is stylistically similar to books like Robert Persig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and movies like Memento, with the philosophical weight of What Dreams May Come.  If you are in the mood for a 'brainstem' evening of movie watching, Echos of Enlightenment is not the movie to see.  It requires the full attention of the viewer, prompting each to reflect on the state of their current existence.

One especially 'enlightening' aspect of the film is the look at the life of a lawyer.  Mr. Coplan (Director) does a particularly good job of illustrating the tedium and minutia that can (and does) drive individuals to brink of implosion.  I for one will never become an attorney after seeing this movie.

Echos of Enlightenment, while not technically perfect, is a film told in a unique and interesting fashion.  Its subject matter is worthy of the art of cinema and should be explored more often.  Thank you Mr. Coplan.  Please make more movies.",1138579200,,1162,5.005208333333333
173756,5,0971448493,"""Echos of Enlightenment"" Dan Coplan's indie is a great study of humanity in the 21st century. The character Dan is, whether or not we admit it, can be found in all of us. He is a  man coping in the 21st century with all the stresses of outside influences hammering away at anything good he has, or is about, when he disappears. This movie is an excellent metaphor for the Buddhist principle of the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds and shows that happiness is possible under any circumstance. It's all up to the individual. The characters journey from Hell to Buddhahood is depicted with seriousness and humor. A great movie for anyone open to the possibilities of innate happiness.",1114819200,4,684,4.7
173757,5,0971448493,"There are films that still come back to me in the most unusual of times and rattle my brain.

Echos of Enlightenment does the same thing, although to a much lesser degree, and I cannot tell you how much that delights me.

This is a time in which most filmmakers do not want to force their viewers to question their lives, their values, or their acceptance of reality. Entertainment is the focus, and I'm all for that, at least most of the time. But a steady diet of fun, thrilling, gory, dorky films eventually leaves a stale taste in your cinematic mouth. Echoes of Enlightenment provides an excellent change of diet.

Daniel is a lawyer. He works very hard. His wife is distant. Daniel works harder. His wife grows more distant. Clients are harder to satisfy. The cases become more difficult. Daniel works even harder. His wife is all but a stranger. Then, one day, Daniel vanishes. He leaves a trail of people whose lives he has touched and altered, but once he hit the coastline, he seems to have vanished into thin air.

The premise almost sounds like an episode of The X Files. But writer/director Dan Coplan doesn't go for the creepy mystery thing. Instead, he heaps so much crap onto the main character that the character's only option is shift gears and simplify his world in an effort to find meaning. His journey of spiritual enlightenment alters everyone with whom he comes in contact, and as he learns more about himself and his place in the world, everyone he meets suddenly finds they have the same desire to delve deeper into themselves and their existence.

Such a film could easily be a rambling mess or the breeding ground for cheap moralizing. Coplan keeps things well balanced between New Age prophet tale and raving looney road picture. For every scene you get of the main character opening his mind, you also get the vague feeling that he has just snapped from the stress of his professional and personal lives. The fact that you are made to closely identify with the main character in the first third of the film lends his spiritual road trip with just enough credibility to keep you by his side until he reaches the coastline and debates his ultimate fate.

Yet, as pleasant as the various threads of the story doing a Maypole dance happens to be, the film is not without a couple of minor weak points. Occasionally, the acting comes across as stiff and staged, and the weird thing is that those particular scenes come across as though they were improvised -- just not improvised with much confidence. Also, a couple of the scenes of characters debating drag on a bit long, as if the running time needed padding or the dialogue needed some minor tightening. Very slight problems in the great scheme of things.

If you can't watch Echos of Enlightenment for the spiritual quest or the human search for meaning, watch it simply because it delivers a profoundly different experience than the run-of-the-mill film. Most likely, you will thank yourself, and you will find the film crossing your thoughts more than you might like to admit.",1102723200,7,3058,4.6940298507462686
173758,4,0971448493,"As the story opens, we're immediately handed a mystery:  Who is Daniel?  What happened in his last days?  Is he Dead?  If so, how?  Through flashbacks, we follow the spiritual transformation, as Daniel slowly awakens to the illusion surrounding him - the lies, the struggle, the social conditioning of everyday life.  Overwhelmed by the world coming down around him, Daniel breaks out, disappears, and comes face-to-face with people all around him suffering from various forms of fear and disconnection.
Daniel's awakening allows him a sort of transcendental detatchment, from which he pronounces wisdom, and causes those around him to stop, think, and transform.  While I appreciate the spirit of the film and script, I found the nature and ease of these transformations distracting and strained.  Daniel seems like a smart and powerful person, and his wisdom is often profound, but even so, the awe-struck reactions he inspires are unrepresentative of the world I know.
Parallel to this, there's a sort of gnawing creepiness about Daniel.  Maybe he's really insane?  Maybe he's a charlatan?  Why not play with these possibilies, and serve back some of the complexity that actually surrounds these issues in real life?
I respect this movie for approaching the human condition in a challenging way, and recommend it to anyone open to Buddhism - anyone who feels the chafe of social conditioning, and wants more...  for those on the fence, or for whom ""spiritual"" is equal parts truth and nonsense...  be forewarned...",1063324800,6,1517,5.168032786885246
173759,5,0971448493,"Absolutely Essential Viewing for all Humanists.
Selected out of over 2000 entrants, ""Echos of Enlightenment"" was shown at the 2002 Telluride Film festival as one of only 12 given a platform. Curious to see this film, I was not disappointed, and, in fact, as a result of seeing it on the DVD now available, I sat watching the end credits convinced it is absolutely essential viewing for all humanists, and for that matter, anyone who has ever made a movie, or is thinking of making one.
Although the subject matter is universal to the human condition, it is difficult to imagine ""mainstream"" Hollywood tackling this in such a head-on manner. Dan Coplan has done this with his first independent feature film.
Mystical in it's approach to the story of an Attorney who disappears in the face of the repellent greed and selfishness of his clients, the entire film, if you see it for no other reason, is remarkable for Dan Coplan's own astonishing and moving performance as the central character.
This stays with you long after you have watched the movie. An extraordinary achievement. Courageous, unstinting and totally honest. Also, as a lay person, you might just look upon the legal profession in a new light. The best of them should watch this movie. The worst of them should be made to watch it. Totally recommended. See it and feel it.",1053475200,4,1336,4.787878787878788

7794388,1,0971448493,"This ""movie"" is fairly bizarre and a pompous take-off on the Buddha's insight about impermanence and the fact that each of us must die.

The five star reviewers thought it was (1) ""a profoundly different experience than the run-of-the-mill film""; (2) one ""would recommend it to anyone especially those that are going through tough times""; (3) another thought ""this is the first time the essence of Buddhism is expressed on the screen....everyone can relate to the impact of a single life on so many others and the struggle for meaning in life; (4) yet another wrote that ""the lawyer's daily trudging his cases up to the courthouse was a great motif for showing the increasing burden his life and his unraveling before he finds enlightenment.""  To (1), yes, a profoundly different experience: bizarre and, as I'll show below, pompous.  (2) I would definitely not recommend it to those going through tough times, if only because of the theme of suicide that erupts throughout this film.  (3) I don't think this reviewer has seen many films--there are a lot of films expressing the Buddha's insights, even pornographic ones.  (4) This is where the film becomes very pompous.  The clear suggestion is that this lawyer, going through his mid-life crisis, has become enlightened--and so can no longer be seen on the earth (his disappearance)--is pompous.  That this character expresses his own importance (my name is ""Daniel""... I am always with you) and that the film-maker characterizes him as becoming enlightened--pretty hopeless stuff.

My guess is that the film won some film festivals because it clearly stated the fact that we are all going to die.  It is worth being reminded of that fact of reality.  But that is not sufficient to say that this is a ""great story told by a visionary"" and the other nonsense on the CD cover.

Save your money.  There are good films out there.  This is not one of them.  I had to click one star since that was the fewest I could click.  I'd prefer to have clicked NO stars.",1390694400,,2008,4.796511627906977

7794391,1,0971448493,"Some of the reviews for this movie appear to be self-marketing attempts. The language used in these reviews is remarkably similar and the ""reviewers"" often only have reviewed this one movie. This is highly unusual. In addition, at least two reviewers included a reference to the 2002 Telluride Film Festival, perhaps to give it an air of authenticity. Upon checking, however, this was NOT one of the movies on the program during that year. I didn't check other years, but this certainly calls into question the validity of these ""reviewers"".
