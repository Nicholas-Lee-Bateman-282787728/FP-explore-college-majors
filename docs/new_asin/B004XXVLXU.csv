4498337,5,B004XXVLXU,This is the best mini-series I have ever seen.  Each episode keeps your attention and the mystery evolves and unwinds just enough to suck you in and keep you guessing.  They did an excellent job acting and selling the story.  I loved it!  Everything you want in a show/movie is right here.  Intense!,1354492800,,299,4.566037735849057
4498338,5,B004XXVLXU,This was the first Korean TV series I watched got to say that it so far is one of the best ones I have watched so far! Mostly decided to watch it because I enjoyed Lee Byung Hun in The Good The Bad and The Weird.,1335225600,,212,3.630434782608696
4498339,1,B004XXVLXU,"I bought this after having it recommended by a family member. I didn't care for it. It was way too sad. The distributer's name goes across the screen every so often (I've been told this is because they get pirated). The ghosted name is distracting to say the least. Besides the really sad and pointless ending, the English subtitles were done poorly and they are often too quick to read. It makes me want to go back to movies put out by YA Entertainment rather than PohKim. I felt like it was a big waste of time",1332028800,5,512,4.288659793814433
4498340,5,B004XXVLXU,"Wikipedia gives the following information: ""Iris is a South Korean espionage television drama series broadcast by KBS in 2009. With a budget in excess of 20 billion won (17 million USD), it, along with its spin-off Athena: Goddess of War, share the record for the most expensive Korean dramas ever produced. Premiering in October 2009, the series was a critical and commercial success, with an average viewership of over 30% in addition to ranking as the top program consistently every week after its debut. The series also took home many of the highest honors at the 2009 KBS Drama Acting Awards, including Byung-hun Lee winning the top recognition, the Daesang Award. Among other nominations and recognitions, Lee and Tae-hee Kim were also named as one of the best on-screen couples.""

My Review In One Breath: This series (20 episodes, 60 minutes each) concerns a National Security System agent who attempts to take down a secret organization. After the introductory opening episodes, the missions are similar to what one would find in the American ""24"" series (excluding the ""real time"" element), with agents attempting to stop terrorist attacks with the use of satellites and information support technicians. Of course, this is in the Korean style with some romance and melodrama blended in. Acting is top notch, with Byung-hun Lee in the lead role and a very good supporting cast: Tae-hee Kim (his love interest and fellow agent), Seung-woo Kim (a North Korean agent) and So-yeon Kim (as the gorgeous North Korean sniper). Production values are slick, the scoring is great at times, and the pacing is very fast for a K-drama with plenty of shootouts (a few of which are fantastic) and suspense. Storyline is clichd but the secret organization is intriguing and represents a brilliant little twist on the North/South Korean conflict. Consequently, the relationships between the characters change significantly in exciting ways and the viewer will have an emotional investment in the protagonists. Highly addictive stuff.",1327449600,9,2025,5.192660550458716
4498341,5,B004XXVLXU,This is a must watch series. The series centers around reunification and nuclear weapons and friendship and betrayals between the characters. It is very exciting and the story line keeps you guessing throughout the show. The production level of this show was the best I have ever seen. Hard to stop watching.  The acting was great.  I can see why IRIS was such a hit in Korea.,1325203200,7,376,4.597014925373134
4498342,5,B004XXVLXU,"IRIS is a fast-paced; heart-pounding Korean spy thriller with English subtitles.  It is one of the best espionage dramas produced.

The action revolves around a young man named Hyun Jun, who is best friends with his roommate, Jin Sa Woo.  They excel at everything and compete against each other within the Special Forces.  They are approached separately by a beautiful woman named Seung Hee, whom they both fall in love with.  They are surprised later to learn that she is part of an elite, covert division called NSS, and that she has been a part of their recruitment.  Ultimately however, she does choose one of them.

Their lives play out like a Greek tragedy however, as they race to prevent a nuclear bomb from being detonated in the center of Seoul.  There is greed, corruption, and hunger for power throughout the series.

At the end, the viewer is faced with the stark realization that many of the political wars and chaos throughout our world have been perpetuated by the desire for wealth by numerous arms dealers.  We have long known that war is good for the economy, but it shakes one to realize that many of the political disturbances between countries have been instigated and devised solely to perpetuate the sale of arms and military weapons.",1323475200,8,1258,4.782407407407407
4498343,5,B004XXVLXU,"The story told in IRIS is a rough trip for the heart - it's either breaking or racing with no slow down in between or on either end.  The differences in the filming - particularly the absence of nudity and its accompanying reliance on facial expressions - is an eye-opening experience that shouldn't be missed by Western viewers.  It's an international spy story with excellent location footage and great beauty behind an electric plot that twists and turns and spits out situations that are all too real and gut-wrenching.  Not a story for children, but a piece of art Western audiences should not miss.",1318809600,3,604,4.788461538461538
4498344,4,B004XXVLXU,"If the Subtitles were done better, I would have given this 5 stars.  Some of the subtitles disappear too fast not giving you enough time to read them, but I did find that I was still able to keep up with what was going on.  Great character development.  The story really pulled me in and made me want to keep watching more episodes.",1393718400,,332,4.238095238095238
4498345,4,B004XXVLXU,"This is one of the best Korean mystery dramas I have seen so far. It just is a real edgeof the seat story. It does not drag. It goes very quickly and has a ending.....well, I do not ever give away anything. I highly recommend this series. The acting is the best.  The action is on going and the suspense builds and builds. I am glad I added this to my collection. Thanks Amazon for a great selection and very good prices. If Amazon does not have it in stock, they have some good sellers available who are honesst and prompt. Enjoy!",1391385600,,531,4.205882352941177
4498346,5,B004XXVLXU,"I'm not one for foreign dramas (I'm way too lazy to read subtitles) but I will admit I watched most of this just for T.O.P. What I got from it, other than an awesome plot, is a crazy love for Lee Byung Hun. He's such an amazing actor and I never pass up the chance to see him in anything now. If you're going to watch it, watch it for him, or the fact that the plot is fantastic because you won't see T.O.P much. It's totally worth it though, great drama!",1390262400,,455,3.9565217391304346
4498347,3,B004XXVLXU,"The storyline was really good. The drama started out really fast, but around mid way through the story slowed way down. I admit I got the drama because of T.O.P, but you barely see him. :( lol",1381795200,,192,4.216216216216216
4498348,5,B004XXVLXU,"I really liked this series alot. Lee Byung Hun is one of my favorite actors & he does an incredible job in this show. The action, drama,mystery & intrigue are awesome. They always try to leave you guessing. Be on the lookout for Iris 2 also.",1380240000,,241,4.260869565217392
4498349,4,B004XXVLXU,"Great box set with English Subtitles.
Only problem is that the bonus DVD with extras does not have English Subtitles.
No hassle and quick delivery",1371772800,,146,4.88
4498350,5,B004XXVLXU,GREAT STORY AND ESPIONAGE STORY.....FAST AND THRILL MOVING  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR WATCHING BY YOURSELF OR WITH GREAT FRIENDS.  LOVED THE CHARACTERS,1367625600,,146,5.904761904761905
4498351,5,B004XXVLXU,"Had heard so much about this K-drama, and being a fan of K-dramas, was anxious to see it but exceeded my expectations. It was FANTASTIC, with non-stop action & thrilling. climatic endings to each episode.

Loved that they included a ""Special Features"" disc that focused on how scenes were shot, though it didn't offer English subtitles like the drama itself did. It was a great purchase & IRIS immediately became one of my all-time favorite K-dramas...and I've been watching them for over 10 years!",1361750400,,498,4.928571428571429
4498352,4,B004XXVLXU,"This Korean drama remind me of James Bond movie. If you like spy action type movie, you'll like this drama. I gave it a 4 stars because of the sad ending (I really don't like the ending) and the subtitle sometimes goes by too fast or a little bit off. The story line is good and the acting, especially the lead actor (Lee Byung Hun) is excellent. I recommend this to all the Lee Byung Hun fans and to all the James Bond movie fans out there.",1357948800,,441,4.080459770114943
4498353,5,B004XXVLXU,Love this show! Feel like it is as good as if not better than any action suspense movie I have ever seen! I was so happy I got it so fast!,1356393600,,138,3.4838709677419355

8447584,5,B004XXVLXU,Better than the movie. A page turner from beginning to end. Action packed with excellent fight scenes. Acting was top of the line with one of the actresses stealing the show. Could watch it over and over again.,1467158400,,210,4.552631578947368
8447585,1,B004XXVLXU,"As, originally aired on KBS, ""Iris"" had very high production values with a lot of ""handheld"" video, action scenes, and was in ""Letterbox"" format. The version I received was in modified, ""4:3"" format which detrimentally changes the composition of the cinematography, and amplifies the ""jittery"" nature of the action scenes to the point it is unwatchable, in my opinion. It is like trying to watch through a telephoto lens. Very disappointing. I returned the set. Amazon promptly refunded the cost as soon as the set was shipped by UPS (Good job, Amazon!).  Do not waste your money and your time on this modified version; get the original.",1454544000,,637,4.953271028037383
