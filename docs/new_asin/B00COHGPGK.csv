5731476,5,B00COHGPGK,"Airport was released in 1969/70 and was a stunning piece of tension and drama. Revolving around incidents at a Metropolitan Airport, this film was very well received. It started the trend of Airport and other disaster films for the following decade. I cannot reccoommend it enough. From the Competent acting and great writing, to the clever direction and gorgeous musical Scoring, Airport still holds up and now makes us yearn for the days when Air travel was still a bit luxurious and intoxicating. I highly reccommend this film. One of my top 100.",1398988800,3,549,4.913978494623656
5731477,5,B00COHGPGK,"I like this movie and would highly recommend it. This is an older movie (1970)  but it has a great story line.  Very humanized. A man decides to kill himself while flying to Europe.  Great special effects considering how old this movie is.  If you like action, this movie has it and much more.",1381363200,,293,4.37037037037037

5731479,4,B00COHGPGK,"As many reviewers have noted this was the film that kicked off the disaster film cycle of the 1970's. What many may not know that the film has a slight grounding in historical fact. Arthur Hailey the writer of the original book was on the tour for the film version of his other book Hotel and got stuck at Chicago's O'hare Airport(named as Lincoln in the novel and film) during the January of 1967 mega snow storm. I had the chance to talk to Hailey in college and asked him how much of the book was based on his experiences. As any Chicagoan that lived during that snowstorm can tell you, one can see the similarities to both the plot of Airport and the events that occurred during that storm. His only regret was that he could not get John Wayne to play the role that Dean Martin played in the film. Wayne wanted  too much money and he felt that the plot of Airport was too close to The High and the Mighty the great 50's disaster film.",1447545600,,938,4.240223463687151
5731480,5,B00COHGPGK,"Good clean sharp version, in Blu Ray.  Took me back a few decades.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for the great '70s catastrophe movies.",1444780800,,143,4.68
5731481,5,B00COHGPGK,"The best thing about this movie is its technical accuracy. I'm a retired airline Captain and, for the most part, it's the way it was circa 1969. From the pilot/controller phraseology, to the Captain getting a line check from the check airman, it's a hark back to the golden age of air travel. And a great commercial for Boeingwhich was what I flew: 727, 737, 757, and 767. Ah, memories.",1443312000,3,386,4.5285714285714285

8583983,5,B00COHGPGK,"I really like this movie. The Bluray looks really good, almost light seeing it in the theatre for the first time. Great cast, Dean Martin, Helen Hayes, George Kennedy and a very young Jaqueline Bisset. I saw this movie when it came out in 1970 while visiting New York. I was 12 and I loved it as a kid, I like even better now. The ""disaster film"" that started it all. Highly recommended.",1510617600,,387,4.315068493150685
8583984,5,B00COHGPGK,"There have been a few disasters and monsters before this movie. However this is the one credited as the beginning of the airplay disaster movies. These have included some sequels and even the ""Air Plane"" spoofs
.
It is fun to look back at the different actors and remember or see them for the first time in a younger body.

The film has several overlapping and intertwining stories; some of the stories seem like soap operas.

A few mentionable scenarios are Mel Bakersfield (Burt Lancaster); airport manager is accused of placing his work before his family. He gets berated in the middle of a crisis by his probably to be ex-wife Cindy Bakersfeld (Dana Winter). Does he also get distracted by his beautiful and efficient assistant? Throw in a pilot playboy, Capt. Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) that is forced to evaluate fatherhood. For comic relief we have Ada Quonsett a geriatric stowaway. Then for the drama there is someone who has nothing to lose and everything to gain if the plane mysteriously does not reach its destination; the man with an attach case D. O. Guerrero (Van Heflin.)

I am not going to go through the whole story it is for fun if you get to speculate on what is going to happen. How ever I must say one of my favorite characters is Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) operations chief that is tasked with clearing the runway of a stuck 707. See him again as the corrupt lawyer, Uncle Andrew, in Agatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile.""",1499385600,,1451,4.638132295719845

8583988,4,B00COHGPGK,"I unfortunately purchased this blu-ray just before they release the entire airport series as a set. That being said, I was only displeased I didn't get the best deal going on this great movie, but was never disappointed in the product. great picture, well worth whatever you end out paying for it.",1472342400,,297,4.730769230769231
8583989,5,B00COHGPGK,"Seeing this movie at age 10, and later reading the novel it's based on - a must for any airline/airport/aviation enthusiast - motivated me to spend much of my career in the amazing airline industry. In 20 memorable years, there were only a handful of times it felt like I was going to work.

About this particular item, the picture quality and sound are amazing, but be aware that the Ultraviolet code EXPIRED on May 2, 2016 and can no longer be redeemed. Since the Blu-Ray alone is $8 more than the Blu-Ray/Ultraviolet version, you're still better off to buy this one. Still, it's disappointing and the seller should note the expiration for integrity's sake.",1466467200,4,659,4.730434782608696
