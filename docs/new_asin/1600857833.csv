7800125,5,1600857833,"I had nearly all the magazines from FW, and because I ran out of space to do any more woodworking (my garage was now taken up with weight lifting equipment) and the magazines were stored all over the place where any space was to be found, I pretty much gave up on woodworking, until...we decided to build a new house this year, so now a 3rd car garage will be a new workshop. Now, that being said, the new house had renewed my interest in woodworking again, and am now looking forward to doing many more projects. Fine Woodworking magazine has been a great inspiration for me all these years, but since I dropped the subscription several years back, had given away most of my older magazines to another woodworking friend, and not wanting to buy all those back issues again, I decided to buy the DVD version: from issue No. 1 to the special tools and shops issue ending 2011 (issue No. 223). It is a great resource; when you first open the programme, all the issues are presented before you in a thumbnail format. Click on any issue, and it is immediately there to start reading. One of the features I love about it is the search and save functions. I can search any word I want (I did claw foot the first time) and all the pages associated with ""Claw foot"" are shown in thumbnail format. Click on any page and there it is ready to read. With the save feature you can save that page or article to your favorites, so you can immediately go back to it at any time. Also, from the page that you went to from your search, you can go forward and backward through the entire magazine, it isn't just that particular article. It is like picking out the magazine from the shelf at random and turning to the exact page you need. Now I know that a lot of you will say, yes, that is the way they all work, or should, but keep in mind, this is my first time I bought a DVD of magazine back issues. Also, the price can't be beat, it is a steal actually, I have seen other magazines do the same and they cost twice as much. I didn't buy those, the price was too high, but this was very reasonable. I'd highly recommend this DVD.",1333411200,4,2113,4.245657568238213
7800126,5,1600857833,"I've often attempted to save issues of great magazines I acquired but every time I moved they were too difficult to keep. Now comes these DVD archives with every issue, in this case 36 years of issues, on one simple DVD with every page of every issue, all the full color images and articles and every topic searchable. I'm going through each issue just as if it was a hard copy, and when I see a topic I really like I save it in my bookmarks. This is so much better than piles of magazines around the house I couldn't be happier.",1329091200,7,529,4.196078431372549
