However, in these Van Veeteren stories, the DVDs are vastly, vastly different.  In the novels Van Veeteren is still leading his crime squad but the DVDs have him retired and just serving as a busibody helper.  His son is barely mentioned in the books but their relationship, his death and VV's daughter-in-law are substantial parts of the plots.  Finally, instead of Nesser's logical dramatic conclusions, each DVD episode ends in a shoot-em-up.

It's a shame that the books plot lines were not followed in the DVDs.  Instead of extraordinary stories, we get run of the mill cop dramas.

READ THE BOOKS!!!",1378684800,3,711,4.875
4428376,5,B004M20YUI,"I had had the mistaken idea that this series would be much of the stereotypical cop stuff, but luckily, it is quite the opposite.  The lead character is intuitive and thoughtful.  He is also a man who feels much emotional pain and struggles with it constantly.  The plots are good, the acting is superb.  Very, very impressive.",1377302400,,327,4.684210526315789
4428377,4,B004M20YUI,"I found the overall production to my liking and the individual episodes watchable. I would not rate it as outstanding, in comparision to many other Swedish detective series I have seen, such as ""Wallander,"" However, the latter is hard to beat. Van Veeteren is worth watchingand would buy it again.",1376438400,3,297,4.96
4428378,4,B004M20YUI,"What is it about Scandinavian mysteries?  They are always more gripping, for me, than the usual American procedural.  This set of Van Veeteren includes 3 episodes: Borkmann's Point, Munster's Case, and Moreno & the Silence.  They are adapted from the books, but they changed some significant elements of the plots, so if you already read the books, you may be surprised when they switch or combine different characters.  I guess they feel they have to simplify the stories for the show.  My favorite episode was Moreno--it's great to see a woman cop be portrayed as fearless and resourceful.",1368403200,5,591,4.989795918367347

4428380,5,B004M20YUI,"If one is accustomed to see the detective being the center of the movie then you have to change your optics. Van Vetteren is working in the background. The active policemen are put on the right track by his deep knowledge of criminal minds and his ""gut feelings""
Interesting to watch.",1359504000,,284,4.588235294117647
4428381,5,B004M20YUI,"Van Veteeren is a retired detective of about 70 years who buys a book store. Of course, his young former police colleagues seek him out for help with difficult cases they couldn't solve without him.
Good stories, superb acting.",1358899200,2,227,4.846153846153846
4428382,4,B004M20YUI,"Having run out of British mysteries, I decided to try this Swedish production. The plots were surprisingly easy to follow with excellent, highly visible subtitles. The pacing is somewhat slow and measured but this helps to keep the viewer on track. The characters are varied but not spectacularly different than those from other crime dramas. The acting is very good and I ordered the next set of DVDs.",1354665600,16,402,4.926470588235294

4428384,5,B004M20YUI,"Interesting, well-scripted and well-acted, including both series of episodes.  More importantly,  there's a successful effort to depart from the ""formula"" increasingly characterizing the crime genre.",1345334400,11,199,6.92
8435410,3,B004M20YUI,"Normally I wouldn't write a review about ''Van Veeteren'' series because, in my humble opinion, is a typical ''Nordic Noir'' tv series, without this distinguishing element that would make it worth mentioning. The series is based on the series of crime novels, written by Swedish Hakan Nesser with the elderly detective living and working in the fictional city of Mardaam which can be seen as a mixture of Swedish and Dutch cultural characteristics that define the identity of the place. That being told, the real reason for writing this review is the astounding acting of the veteran Swedish actor Sven Wolter who is the absolutely perfect choice for the role of the grumpy and stubborn Van Veeteren, thus making the series more enjoyable and entertaining. To be absolutely clear, by no means this is a non-watchable option for crime fiction fans, but I think that especially some of the episodes, lack the fascinating storyline and plot in order to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat as it is the case for the top Scandinavian crime series such as ''The Bridge'', ''Bedrag'' or ''Forbrydelsen''.",1526860800,,1101,4.924731182795699

8435416,5,B004M20YUI,This is another top police drama with lots of inter- action between the cast. The story lines are great and it is very well made.

8435418,5,B004M20YUI,"I just discovered Swedish television series (Wallander, Irene Huss, Borgen)  and was so impressed that I wanted more and so I decided to try Van Veeteren.  Was not disappointed.  I wish there were more than 6 episodes.  For me it's right up there with Inspector Montalbano (italian) which I love.  Goes to show you that to make a good movie or television series you don't have to fill it with blood and guts and violence.  All you need is a good plot, good actors and voila!",1395792000,,474,4.453488372093023
8435419,4,B004M20YUI,"The actor who plays Van Veeteren (I believe his name is Sven Wolter), carries this series. I'm not saying the other actors aren't good, but it just wouldn't hold together without Wolter. I've read a couple of the novels the series is based on, and in them, Van Veteeren starts as a working Inspector who retires to the bookstore after several novels. In the TV series he starts out retired, but he remains heavily involved in the cases. While I like the Martin Beck series and the Krister Henriksson Wallander series much better, this one grows on you; and Sven Wolter is really a wonderful actor.",1390780800,2,597,4.6415094339622645
