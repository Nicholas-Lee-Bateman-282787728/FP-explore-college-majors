4463998,5,B004SLW6OK,"""Flower and Snake"" (""Hana to Hebi"") is something of a phenomena in Japan, not unlike ""The Story of O"" or ""The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.""  It was originally a series of cult novels by fetish-author Dan Oniroku, and there have been no less than ten versions filmed since the original 1974 version staring the bondage superstar Naomi Tani (""Wife to be Sacrificed"").  This latest version, by horror auteur Takashi Ishii, famous as the writer of ""Evil Dead Trap"" and director of ""Freeze Me"" and ""Angel Guts,"" is the first to tackle the story with a decent budget, and a cast of well-known actors.

Like most films of the genre, the story is just set up.  A businessman finds himself owing an unpayable debt to a local ganglord, who demands the man's wife as payment.  His wife, Shizuko,  is a famous and beautiful tango dancer, with an immaculate dancer's body and a strong spirit.  The man acquiesces, as the ganglord is over 90 years old, and he assumes he will be unable to do anything too terrible to his wife.  Of course he is wrong, and the poor girl begins her trip to hell.  In a carnival of fetishism, familiar to anyone who has seen ""Eyes Wide Shut"" or other films in this style, Shizuko is sexually tortured and exhibited to a club of like-minded individuals, while the old boss watches on TV.  Eventually her strong spirit is broken.

Ishii has taken this familiar story, and attempted to make something akin to art from the degradation.  The scenarios involving Shizuko are dreamlike, and she fades from one episode to another.  The camera follows her hazy perceptions, while still taking a voyeurs approach, placing the viewer as one of the audiences enjoying Shizuko's descent.

Most of the success of this version of ""Flower and Snake"" comes from Ishii's unique vision as a director, and the power of the lead, Aya Sugimoto playing Shizuko.  She is an incredibly strong lead, with a beautiful body and a powerful face. While not quite a household name, she is probably best known for playing Queen Beryl in ""Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon.""  The rest of the cast is equally strong. Renji Ishibashi (""One missed call"") puts in a disturbing turn as the ganglord, and Takashi Miike regular Kenichi Endo (""Happiness of the Katakuris,"" ""Visitor Q"") is equally repulsive as the ganglord's lieutenant.

There is some concern that the Media Blaster's DVD release of ""Flower and Snake"" has been edited, but this isn't so.  Both the Japanese release and the US release have a running time of 115 minutes, and I have seen both versions and can say that no obvious cuts have been made.  The story is murky, and especially the last part of the film, where Shizuko begins to lose her perspective on time and space.  For a DVD release of this genre, it is really well done, with a ""Making of..."" feature as well as cast interviews, with actress Sugimoto explaining why she decided to make this kind of film.  If you like the genre, it is a masterpiece.  If you don't, then you will probably won't like ""Flower and Snake.""",1157932800,26,3017,4.695817490494297
4463999,3,B004SLW6OK,Media Blasters edited the movie badly.  The first part of the story starts off quite well and flows smoothly. When it gets to the second part you can see obvious cuts with the visuals as well as the subtitling. One of the characters (Kyoko) disappears completely and is never heard of again.  Where the first part is easily followed the second part is nothing but jumbled and confusing imagery more fitting a music video than a work by Takashi Ishii.  If Media Blasters releases an UNCUT version I's gladly buy it to see Mr. Ishii's true work.  This current version is a bad hack job and an insult to Mr. Ishii and his talent.,1120694400,26,626,4.464912280701754
8439968,2,B004SLW6OK,"Is ok if you like just about every Japanese fetish you can add in one film.  As a movie, it's boring as hell and as usual with asian movies, wierd or stupid ending. Depending on how much of a fanboy you are.",1416700800,,207,3.9285714285714284
8439969,5,B004SLW6OK,"Asian extreme film auteur Takashi Ishii ('Ronin', 'Freeze Me', 'Flower & Snake' 1 and 2 as well as 'The Brutal Hopelessness of Love', which isn't out in the US yet, but scour around E*ay and you'll find one cheap and worth every penny) is an Art House Sexploitation master of film, and this is an amazing re-make of the same titled flick from 1974, directed by Masaru Konuma, based on the eponymous novel by Dan Oniroku. High production values, a great cast and an astonishing performance by the equally astonishingly beautiful Aya Sugimoto make this film an absolute must-see/own slice of Asian sexploitation. This is one for the books, my friends.

Words cannot do this one justice, but nouns and adjectives like sensual, shocking, sadistic, seductive, supremely sexual, psychotic, and sadomasochistic immediately spring to mind. I don't want to give too much away as it's as insane as huffing glue when Aya Sugimoto undergoes her 'treatment' at the hands of her captors, and her body is a drug you'll long to become addicted to, and pray there's no 12 step recovery program for. Yeah, she's that desirable. And then some...and then some more.

Grab this flick as soon as possible, then snatch the sequel, 'F+S II' (another slice of heaven and hell). The blu-ray is an improvement over all previous editions of this flick that have circulated for years (tho the Tokyo Shock print was more than acceptable and considerably cheaper). A big hurrah for 'Hana To Hebi' 1 and 2, and props to Takashi Ishii for bringing some much-deserved class and sophistication to what's usually considered a 'classless' genre of increasingly popular films that will eternally remain ignored by mainstream media outlets and reviewers. Kudos to all responsible for enlightening our erotic sensibilities and allowing us to hit paydirt as opposed to the ho-hum offerings usually offered in this genre here on Amazon and elsewhere. Certainly ""bound to please"" its core audience.",1317859200,10,1955,5.04953560371517
8439970,4,B004SLW6OK,"It seemed to be unchanged in the work seen in rental DVD of Japan several years ago.
It bought it without thinking that the edit was different or there was a screen cutting. However, is it safe because it did not change so much?..might say by you... This world is peculiar though the original is not read. I feel the one like passion to writer's named Kiroku Dan power. No do be known whether it is the one in the foreign country without, and no do be known whether it is the one as the work of the mood to which it is peculiar that this is still in the country named Japan equal in the world.

PS - I'll have to admit I got my copy elsewhere, begins with an E, and not the Mediablaster edition either, and it's uncut compared to what I've read from some other reviewers here , AND I paid ten bucks for it brand new, including shipping...

8439975,5,B004SLW6OK,"Supervisor Takashi Ishii who has active career as cartoonist. He is splendidly expressing the world in Japan SM by an original taking a picture method and production.
It is wonderful that lead actress's Aya Sgimoto endures hard bondage play.
It is wonderful that the kimono that she wears is fantastic, and especially tightens all loincloths.
The loincloth is a traditional undergarment of Japan that tightens the small of one's back by the complicated process by using the cloth of the cotton of six feet or more.
It is an item often used by the SM play of Japan to see it curvaceously when the woman applies it though it is originally men's undergarments.
Aya tightens the loincloth of white, red, purple, and the Mameshibori pattern, and I can feel the tradition beauty and sexy in Japan in this movie.
I want you to be interested in you more about the loincloth of Japan.",1215043200,4,875,4.7254901960784315

8439977,1,B004SLW6OK,"I had seen director Takashi Ishii's ""Freeze Me"" and thought it was a good, dark revenge flick, so I decided to seek out other works from him. While I think ""Flower & Snake"" is little more than an excuse to slip nude, full-on S&M bondage scenes into the Japanese cineplex and pass it off as ""art,"" it did have its moments.

Unfortunately, I missed a lot of those moments because the subtitles were horrendously jacked up at the beginning and end of the film. Entire passages of dialogue would blip on the screen for a split second, too fast to be read, then the last portion would finish up. So I would no idea what some characters were saying, only being able to read the tail end, ie:

- [Quick blip of subtitles.]

- [Character speaks dialogue, sometimes as long as five to seven seconds. Meanwhile, screen is completely blank.]

- [Character finishes speaking and last portion of subtitles comes on screen: ""...can't trust him!""]

This happened at least 15 times throughout the film. I'm certain I missed several integral plot points because of this. For instance, I still don't know the full reason behind why the wealthy businessman in the film had to turn his wife over to the lecherous yakuza ganglord in the first place. Debt played a part in it, I know, but beyond that, I'm clueless.

What's even weirder is that I tried to freeze the single frame where the subtitles would pop up, but even that wouldn't work! My TV doesn't support closed-captioning, and who knows, it may be just my specific copy that has the malfunction, but if all the DVD copies of this film are like this, I recommend you steer clear of ""Flower & Snake"" until the problem is fixed -- or until you find a Japanese-speaking friend who can watch it with you and fill in the blanks.",1161561600,7,1761,4.539432176656152
