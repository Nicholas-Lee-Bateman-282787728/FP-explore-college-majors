8156957,4,B000KHX7J4,First saw this trio of movies at a film festival in Christchurch many years ago in a heavily censored version. Don't think that this trio is a good as the Immoral Tales from the same director but still worth while all the same. Nice to have a decent refurbished copy to view of these unusual movies. Will be watching out for other product from this controversial director particularly if the quality on dvd is a good or even better than this one is.,1258243200,,449,4.421686746987952
8156958,1,B000KHX7J4,"The end of this movie is a total surprise. To me anyway. There was no way I could watch this movie through.
If you feel you must see this movie save some moeny and rent NOT buy or better yet when you see it just go ""BYE""",1196553600,,220,3.702127659574468
8156959,1,B000KHX7J4,"I was not able to find the uncut runtime for the ""Immoral Women"" anywhere, but anyone who is familiar with cinema can easilly understand this movie is censored. There are some scenes only a few frames long. Some scenes without beginning or end, scenes jumping to unrelated scenes because of the censored parts. I felt like watching the R or even PG-13 (except a few frames) version. Really very funny editing.

This film has nothing ofending as it is. I hope someone prints the UNrated version instead of this not rated version.

This movie isn't worth over 15$ as it is. Because it isn't anywhere near complete.

Note to the studio; generally movie collectioners buy this genre, and they are completionists. So selling an uncomplete version for almost 30$ is absurd. This movie as it is has no value for any collectioner. And i really feel bad because i should have known that your ""not rated"" is a cover-up for this crippled version.",1178755200,13,935,4.723926380368098
8156960,5,B000KHX7J4,Jaw dropping piece of erotica and excellent dvd presentation from Severin.,1171584000,,74,5.818181818181818
8156961,2,B000KHX7J4,"""Les Hrones du Mal"" (Heroines of Evil) is the original title of this film by Walerian Borowczyk. The film occupies that grey-zone between Arthouse and Softporn. Its theme is of wronged women seeking revenge. However audiences will invariably fixate on Borowczyk's fascination with bestiality. There are three separate stories, lasting roughly 40 minutes each. The first is titled ""Margherita"" and is set in Renaissance Rome. Poor baker's daughter, Margherita, uses her beauty to bed and kill the rich and powerful men who lust after her. The second, titled ""Marceline,"" is about a young girl who enjoys sexual romps with her pet rabbit. When her repressive and somewhat nutty parents have the rabbit killed and cooked for dinner, she goes berserk, gets the local black butcher to deflower her in the slaughterhouse and then returns home to slice her parents' throats. The third story titled ""Marie"" is about a young woman who is kidnapped, held for ransom and raped by her captor while her ineffectual husband bumbles around. She is saved by her heroic pet dog who gives her useless husband a bite in the balls for good measure before claiming his reward from the grateful victim.

Needless to say if bestiality offends you, stay away. Personally I didn't find it offensive. However I did find it boring -  I actually nodded off halfway through and that is a bad sign for any film. I watched it again on a separate occasion to give it the benefit of the doubt before coming to any conclusion. Parts of it were erotic and production values were generally high. Photography especially was very good. Everything is in soft-focus and filmed under soft lighting. The women are lovely and they are beautifully attired - or not, as the case may be. The film relies on a refreshing Renaissance-style music score, giving it a certain touch of class. However it just didn't come together. The high-art style of erotica, the beautiful photography and the deliberate silliness and implausibility in the screenwriting and plot didn't mesh. The post-production dubbing with poor lip-synching (even in the original French track) didn't help. Well, at least for me. Some viewers might very well enjoy it - as several reviews here attest. It might very well fascinate Americans unfamiliar with the topic and who find the very idea ""jaw-dropping"" and ""ground-breaking"".

The sex is not explicit. Neither is there much of it. But it is well done and pretty to look at. The film would garner an NC-17 solely due to the implied bestiality - the closest it actually gets to the real stuff is the little bunny rabbit nibbling on Marceline's luxuriant bush while she writhes in pleasure (a rather cute scene, beautifully photographed) -  the dog's high point is biting the husband's balls; we never get to see it having its way with the wife.

Severin of course doesn't disappoint with its lovely and quite flawless transfer of this 1979 film. Colours are mostly pastel-hued but always true and pleasing to the eye. Black level is perfect. The film is presented in its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio, pillarboxed into an anamorphic frame (enhanced for widescreen TV). The original French 2.0 Mono track is provided, along with an alternate English 2.0 Mono dub. The sound has good presence and dialogue is clear throughout. Optional English subtitles are also provided. The only Extras are the original theatrical trailer and a biography of Walerian Borowczyk.",1171584000,23,3434,4.986038394415358
8156962,5,B000KHX7J4,"in some ways even superior to 'immoral tales'. a seminal title for fans of the genre, and a great dvd to boot.",1171411200,,110,4.045454545454546
8156963,2,B000KHX7J4,"This is a film involving three stories about three women over three different periods in history.

The first, with Marina Pierro is set in the Renaissance in Rome where she is the baker's daughter who sleeps with an artist. She double-crosses men in order to rake in some of the money that's flowing into the Papal coffers.

The second story is about a girl who has an un-natural relationship with her rabbit, and then looses her virginity to a black man as he has her pressed up against a number of sheep in a pen in a slaughter-house. Not very tasteful.

The third story hints at a woman having a close relationship with a dog that protects her from a number of men. Also distasteful.",1171238400,,686,4.472
