7970969,1,B00006L91J,A horrid profanation of John Dahl's original neo noir masterpiece and Linda Fiorentino's fem fetal bitch par excellence. How did the original film makers allow this to come into being?,1475798400,,184,5.166666666666667

7970974,1,B00006L91J,"I can't say this movie is the worst movie ever made or even the worst movie I have ever seen.  But giving it even one star is one star too many.  The film makers took a first class noir film that was up there with Body Heat and House Of Games and came up with a ludicrous sequel that does not have one original cast member.  Linda Fiorintino gave a five star performance in The Last Seduction.  Putting Joan Severance in the same role is like replacing Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice with Cindy Crawford.  It can be done, but is ANYBODY (well maybe one person, it did get one good review) going to believe it?  The dialogue is ridiculous and unbelievable and if possible, the acting is even worse.  The original movie had you on the edge of your seat.  This one does also, but not for the same reason.  In the original you couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  In the sequel you can't wait for it to be over.  Downright painful.  Save your money.",1187740800,8,955,4.273743016759776
7970975,1,B00006L91J,This movie needs help. There are no familiar faces only familiar characters. The acting is poor and the plot is thin. A new twist would have been a nice addition. As it is you know exactly what is going to happen. Average characters going through the motions. Save yourself a purchase and some time. Steer clear of this second class movie.,1142640000,8,339,4.573770491803279
