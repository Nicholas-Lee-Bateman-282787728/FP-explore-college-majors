7866218,2,6304266758,"I've always liked Wincott as well as the low budget DTV action flicks of this era, but this one seems just a little TOO rushed for my tastes. It's a RUNNING MAN rip off complete with that film's secondary villain Sven Ole Thorsen, who, imposing a figure as he is, seems extremely limited physically. The camera work and choreography are very bad though, so let's blame that.",1514592000,,374,4.597014925373134
7866219,3,6304266758,"""Fatal Combat"" here (originally and more aptly titled ""No Exit"") isn't your typical Jeff Wincott action picture. There are fair few aspects linking this one to typical martial arts B-movies of the time, with a better-than-average dramatic cast and a script that definitely tries to be more consequential and serious than most films dealing with secret fight tournaments. For some folks, this might make it one of the best Wincott vehicles. Me, I thought it was all a bit much; part of this can be blamed on the movie's marketing, which doesn't indicate that this is a departure from the norm for Jeff, but also on the fact that there's not much payoff for the drama in either a resolution or karate fights.

The story: philosophy professor and martial artist John Stoneman (Wincott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-of-Justice/dp/6302586313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission of Justice</a>) is kidnapped by a wealthy sadist who broadcasts a to-the-death tournament to paying clients from a subarctic prison (Richard Fitzpatrick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boondock-Saints/dp/B00005PJ8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boondock Saints</a>).

I think most of this film's unusual nature can be attributed to writer-director Damian Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacrifice/dp/B004EP43SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacrifice</a>), the boxer-turned-filmmaker who became one of the more ambitious, hit-or-miss blenders of the action and drama genres. His film here is equal parts drama and action, but the latter is definitely weaker than the former. There are between four and six fights - depending on what you consider to be a fight scene - and virtually none of them are really worth watching. Jeff's really by himself here, since the closest he comes to having an opponent who can match his martial arts is Sven-Ole Thorsen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00AEFY5B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>) as the sadistic champion, but Thorsen's more of a brawler and doesn't contribute a good match. Even when Jeff engages a couple opponents in spear fights within an electrified cage, the result is merely average (how is that even possible?).

At its height, the movie certainly approaches being a respectable drama. The cast also includes the late Guylaine St-Onge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earth-Final-Conflict/dp/B00453QOC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earth - Final Conflict</a>) as Wincott's wife and Douglas O'Keefe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nuremberg/dp/B00005B6OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nuremberg</a>) as the top  henchman, and the result is a film that focuses more on and mostly pulls off its acting content. Jeff's given more legitimate dramatic scenes in this one than perhaps any other of his films from the same era. The problem for me is that the movie is so unabashedly dark and bleak that it gets downright depressing after a while. Here's infanticide and rape in the same movie, not to mention weightier murders than we're used to in films like these, without any substantial payoff - jeez, even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B000P0J0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>&nbsp;knew when to throw a bone, and it didn't even have martial art fight scenes.

Two things I admire about the film are the philosophical (or anti-philosophical?) angle the script tries for and how believable the freezing setting is made, with the performers' breath visible when they're speaking - it probably wasn't the easiest shoot. Altogether, the movie is an interesting departure from the action norm, but the novelty wears off by the time the film is halfway over due to a lack of tradeoff from the action department. On a bad day, this would get two stars from me, but because I can see the genuine effort that went into this one's production, I'll be generous.",1360886400,,4150,6.4035714285714285
7866220,3,6304266758,"I am a huge Jeff Wincott fan, I honestly believe him to be the most overlooked and undervalued martial arts star of the 90's. With that said, No Exit (also known by the more generic sounding title Fatal Combat) is not one of his best. The actioner suffers from being a tad bit too familar, it follows in the footsteps of numerous bigger movies like the Running Man starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and even more B-level movies such as the somewhat better (and simularly titled) Lorenzo Lamas vehicle Final Round.

Wincott stars as an ethic professor with three tenth degree black belts. He's a peaceful warrior until his pregnant wife is attacked in a parking garge and when the peaceful way fails Jeff opens a 40 of whoopa** on these cats, killing one of them and becoming a national hero. This catches the eye of an evil megalomanic who holds televised death matches for the filthy rich to get their jollies. Jeff isn't a willing pertisapent, so he's abducted him along with one of his students, and a gun is held to his wife's head, to force him to fight (and kill).

The martial arts are top notch, but not as many fights as you'd might expect from low grade explotation, but we do get some great training montages. Jeff Wincott is very charisamatic, and not a bad actor (his brother is the respected character actor Michael Wincott). Still, as I say the material is too familar, and the supporting cast leave something to be desired. This one is worth a look, but not necessarily top of the list. Better Wincott vehicles include Mission of Justice, Martial Law II and Open Fire.",1247270400,2,1581,4.622775800711744
7866221,4,6304266758,"I doubt there is a bad Jeff Wincott movie out there.  For B-grade action flicks, all of his I have seen are above average and Fatal Combat is no exception.

Fatal Combat, also called ""No Exit"", has an original feel to it compared to most martial art/gladiator like movies.  As with most gladiator type films, the evil greedy guy brings in different people from all over to compete to the death.  In Fatal Combat, the fighters are forced to compete on a cable television show known as ""No Exit"".  The site is in the Arctic and the fights are various, more than just punching and kicking, but involve quick thinking in the indoor or outdoor environment in which they are forced to fight to the death.  Determined to not kill, the evil leader does everything he can to wear down the strong Wincott character, who has been captured along with one of his college students.  There are some disturbing elements to the film, but it only adds to the tension that the Wincott character feels, determined to stay alive and refrain from killing, but he can only choose one in the end.

The fight scenes are nothing spectacular as far as raw martial arts skills go, but they are original nonetheless.  The final fight between the Wincott character and the brutish bad guy fighter is nothing too spectacular either, and is shorter than I had hoped.  But thanks to decent acting, good story, and lots of suspense and conflict, Fatal Combat delievrs as a good B-flick overall.",1163721600,,1460,4.64591439688716
7866222,5,6304266758,"One of Jeff Wincott's best by far in this explosive martial arts adventure. The twisted invention of a billionare broadcaster is a game of martial arts fighting between modern gladiators who have all been kidnapped and brought to an underground fortress. The gladiators become slaves and prisoners at this hell hole and no one has ever succeded in escaping. But when a heroic martial artist (Jeff Wincott) is forced to fight for his life and wife's life for an audience of wealthy thrill seekers, he breaks all the rules by not killing his opponents in his matches. Very good flick for the martial arts movie buff.",1131408000,,614,4.80188679245283
