In 1917 Benny Leonard fought Freddy Welch and won. The newspaper headlines tell of sending the AEF to France. A boxer earns money when he is on top. Should he earn money to set up a trust fund for his parents? Kid Lombard's sister asks him to go easy on him. Is this an act? The fight goes on. Lombard is knocked down, again and again. Can anything be done? Benny joins up to fight in France. He returns after the Armistice to resume boxing. Lombard is still around, but has a problem now. His condition is ""hopeless"". What can Benny do? There is a fight with Tommy Lombard. Tommy wins at last! [Was it fixed?] His sister cries for him. ""He'll get better."" Benny walks away. A man tells the rest of the story.

This appears to come from a television drama from the 1950s. Is this story believable? Note the low-cost production typical of television dramas. Its importance is the appearance of Michael Landon as a young actor. He gained fame later as a character on ""Bonanza"" and then ""Little House on the Prairie"". Its not a bad story, just the sort of sentimental story favored by newspaper reporters of that era.",1357776000,,1146,4.4523809523809526
