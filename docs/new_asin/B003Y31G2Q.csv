8408611,3,B003Y31G2Q,"When I paid $20 for all 200 episodes of Sailor Moon, I knew it wasn't going to be the highest quality product out there. All in all, though? Worth the money! Considering how cheap it is, it's totally worth it. It's packaged well, all my discs had a sleeve, everything is labaled properly. Occasionally (I'd say once every 2 - 3 episodes), if there is a sign on screen, the subtitles will say what the sign says for an entire minute or so instead of what the dialogue is. So a couple lines of dialogue tend to be missed, but it's not hard to keep up. And like I said, it's pretty rare.

The sound and picture quality is pretty low (at least for the 1st season, I haven't watched any further), but after half an episode or so, it's rather unnoticeable. There is no distortion, no inability to hear the voices/music, and no issues with seeing the picture. My discs haven't skipped or frozen yet, either.

For this cheap, buy it! But know that if you're paying more than 30 or 40 dollars for it, it might not be worth the money (it's hard to say, considering how expensive some DVD sets out there are)

So, all in all, no, it's not the shiniest, best quality picture out there. But for $20, it's an awesome buy, and if you're like me, the reminiscing of Sailor Moon will make it more than worthwhile.",1351209600,,1296,4.325102880658436
8408612,3,B003Y31G2Q,"I bought this item on Ebay, and let me tell ya, it's a good buy. If video quality's not something your looking for. Being a Chinese bootleg, the episodes of Classic, R, S, and SuperS are copied from the official ADV and Geneon/Pioneer DVD releases. Also like the official releases, the Specials as well as the swimsuit episode for R and the movies are not included.  The video quality isn't the best; the image is slightly blurry and movement is NOT smooth in most episodes. Some of the S episodes even freeze for a few seconds. And then there's the packaging... The outside looks impressive, but when you open it, there's sleeves like you would find in a CD holder. And while I'm on the subject of the sleeves, there's not enough of them for all 9 discs to have thier own sleeves. In my set, the last 2 DVDs for R are in the same sleeve!

As for the art, I have only one coplaint; the Classic DVDs are mislabeled. Classic and R both have 2 discs, and the first 4 discs all say Sailor Moon R.

Other than all that I have mentioned, this is an OK set.",1295395200,3,1050,4.24
