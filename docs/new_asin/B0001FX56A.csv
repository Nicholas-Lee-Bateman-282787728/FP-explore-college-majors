1996334,4,B0001FX56A,"It may be impossible to ever get a first-class transfer of Bill and Coo, so we're left with what we have. Still, seeing this remarkable film is an unforgettable experience. There is no film like this one, nor is it likely that anyone will ever attempt a live-action film starring birds. In my view, Bill and Coo is an incredible achievement that no kid should grow up without seeing.",1200096000,8,383,4.565217391304348
1996335,5,B0001FX56A,"Decent rendition of the original classic that I saw as a child. Price-wise, it was decent especially considering the price tag on many new dvds on the market today. We purchased it as a gift for our daughter. She was totally enthralled and it is one of her favorite cartoons, which makes it totally worth it....",1197417600,5,311,4.571428571428571
1996336,1,B0001FX56A,As a child I saw Bill and Coo in the theater.  It was one of my favorite movies.  I was looking forward to sharing the film with my grandchildren but the DVD quality was so bad it wasn't worth seeing; it was too dark the sound was garbled and I felt it was a total rip off.,1188000000,4,273,3.7719298245614037
1996337,5,B0001FX56A,"I only learned of the existence of this film a few weeks ago, when a parrot group I'm a member of showed it to its membership. I missed the showing, so went to Amazon and picked it up.

This film is completely eye-opening and completely charming. I know it's a kids movie but I think most grown-ups would enjoy seeing it, just because it must have taken the film-makers years to get the birds to perform as well as they do. (Of course, these birds may have been so well-trained that they did it all on the first take!)

My only regret is that it appears that the VHS copies now in circulation were duplicated from an old old print. This print is by no means unwatchable, but gets very dark during the crucial fire-rescue scene.  If there's ever been a good candidate for digital restoration, Bill and Coo is it!",1172534400,3,811,4.357615894039735
1996338,4,B0001FX56A,"This made an impact on my son as a child, and now as a middle-aged parent he still remembers it, so was delighted to find it available for home use. Great kid entertainment and will look forward to introducing it to my great grandkids in the very near future.  Its old, color isn't as good as original, but after 50 years me, too!",1171584000,,330,4.238095238095238
1996339,5,B0001FX56A,"This film used trained birds in a variety of roles, to tell a story about a bird town constantly threatened by a raven. Good wins in the end, but hero and heroine, evil doer and the general cast were superb -- and enchanting.

When I was very, very young I saw ""Bill and Coo"" in my native country. It was dubbed in Spanish and in the almost 55 years since then, I have never forgotten ""El cuervo, el cuervo viene para aca"" which was the battle cry of the little birds upon seeing the invading raven.

Discovering this wonderful movie again was a thrill. This time the Spanish version was not available, but the lovely creatures were still adorable. Unfortunately, time has taken its toll on the color quality and many portions are washed out.

However,somewhere in a forgotten vault there must be a great print of this extraordinary film for young and old, and one of the media giants may decide to re-issue it in DVD (with subtitles in every conceivable language) for the enjoyment of generations to come.

Until that happens, don't miss the VHS version. Watch it with children and grandchildren, and be prepared to argue against buying a parakeet or love bird! The price is right and the unbelievable technology and animal training (and patience) involved in making the film will stay in your mind for ever.",1122163200,11,1309,4.653679653679654

1996341,4,B0001FX56A,"A sweet, amazing, adorably hokey movie starring a cast of incredibly well trained birds that will steal your heart! Great movie for kids. Only giving this 4 instead of five stars because as others mentioned this is an unrestored movie from the 40's or 50's, and yes, the quality is rather bad. Some scenes are washed out, some scenes are too dark, color is off, but is still very watchable. This is a movie everyone should see at least once to marvel at the amazing animal training that went into this, it's truly a one of a kind film. Just don't let the quality bother you and it won't :)",1437782400,,589,4.363636363636363

1996344,5,B0001FX56A,"One of my favorite old time independent films.  I had a VHS version in the 80's, but this DVD is quite nice and even the original is a bit fuzzy at times, so I fell an admirable job was done in the quality of the DVD. Thanks for redoing an old favorite of my 2 favorite lovebirds!",1424563200,,280,3.912280701754386
1996345,5,B0001FX56A,"A delightful, one of a kind movie from long ago, which isn't likely to ever be repeated, even with today's CGI technology.

I have purchased several of these to give as gifts to my bird-lovin' friends.

You should too, if you have any.",1417564800,,235,4.441860465116279
1996346,4,B0001FX56A,"Bird fanciers will enjoy this oddity, basically a story concocted around the tricks a guy taught his pet birds. Told in an an anachronistic newsreel-narrator style, it nevertheless is engaging, if you like birds at all.  Prints of this movie in good shape are hard to find.",1404432000,,273,4.808510638297872

1996348,3,B0001FX56A,This was a nostalgic trip for me to return seeing this movie after a 60 year absence.  The visual quality was not what I expected but the story was unique and different.  Good movie for children but I think adults would become bored after the first 30 minutes.,1398038400,,260,4.395833333333333
1996349,5,B0001FX56A,"The sound isn't very well done, the video could use some cleaning... however when you realize the ""actors"" are all birds/animals and no humans in sight.... it's fantastic!",1397347200,,171,5.142857142857143
1996350,5,B0001FX56A,This movie was cute in an amazing sort of way. The quality of the disc is excellent considering the age and budget of this 1946 production. What a Darling Holiday Surprise!,1387756800,,172,4.580645161290323
1996351,5,B0001FX56A,"This movie is completely adorable, and it would be a wonderful gift for any bird lover. I first saw a clip on YouTube and I knew I had to track down a copy of the full-length film.

The movie is cast entirely in animals - mostly small parrots - and the amount of training that must have gone into the film is mind boggling. The storyline is charming, the narrator's voice is very pleasant, and if you know anything about how difficult it is to train animals, the entire movie will leave you stunned. I don't know how this movie is so unpopular.",1353974400,,544,4.281553398058253
1996352,5,B0001FX56A,"I still love this movie to this day.  I remembered seeing Bill and Coo in the early 1960s on TV.  I fell in love with it immediately!  In the late 1980s I purchased a VHS tape of the movie and had my hubby see it too.  At the time we had 2 parakeets and they watched it with great interest.  I just got the dvd a few days ago and watched it with great delight.  I'm an animal lover, especially birds, and it was refreshing to see something that did not smack of violence or crude language. I am purchasing another dvd for the granddaughter of a friend of mine.  I hope she loves it too!
Although the quality of the movie was never really clear; Ken Murray used his own home movie camera; it still conveys a sweet innocence of a bygone era.",1335657600,,739,4.090277777777778
1996353,1,B0001FX56A,"This dvd is so dark you can hardly see anything. i have this on vhs, and it is  old and well-used. But the tape is 100 times clearer and brighter than the new dvd! i can't believe someone is actually charging the high premium prices they are for this terrible copy. This is not worth 1$, let alone the premium price i was charged. Unwatchable! I could have made a better copy myself! Very disappointed!",1327622400,,402,4.36
1996354,4,B0001FX56A,THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MOVIE I USED TO WATCH AT MY GRANDPARENTS WHEN IT WAS BROADCAST ON CHRISTMAS DAY FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS DURING THE MID 1950'S. IT'S NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR BUT IS CHARMING ENOUGH SINCE IT WAS MADE IN 1947 AND WON A SPECIAL OSCAR. IT'S ALL TRAINED BIRDS DOING A MELODRAMA. NOT FOR AN ACTION FILM BUFF BUT WOULD BE SOMETHING FUN TO WATCH AND COMMENT ON WITH LITTLE KIDS THESE DAYS.,1289865600,2,388,4.256756756756757
1996355,5,B0001FX56A,"This is really one of the cutest movies ever..with live birds of all kinds doing the most amazing things in a script that makes their ""bird town"" come alive.  Children will love it, and adults who have, or want, a pet bird will also enjoy it.
The people who trained these birds should've gotten an academy award for sheer genius and patience.  There is absolutely nothing objectionable about any part of this film, every secondd is a pure gem of film making.  I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't too ""grown up"" to enjoy fantasy.",1276992000,,534,4.541666666666667
1996356,5,B0001FX56A,one of a kind. very nostaglic. i doubt if anyone today could make a film likethis. all they know is digital,1269129600,,107,4.142857142857143
1996357,5,B0001FX56A,I liked the movie...very creative.  I have birds so that is why I wanted to see it.  Interesting that it won an academy award in the 40's.,1265932800,,138,4.074074074074074
1996358,4,B0001FX56A,Nothing like this before or since. For that we should be truly grateful. Little kids get a kick out of the birds and we old folk are speachless,1206576000,,143,4.142857142857143
1996359,5,B0001FX56A,"I first saw Bill & Coo several years late one night and taped it from TV many years ago. I came across the video when I was in the process of transfering my home videos to DVD. It wasn't in very good condition so I came online hoping it would be here on DVD. Though I couldn't find it on DVD I did find it on VHS and ordered it anyway.

This is one classic hit that NEEDS to be restored if possible. You certainly don't see things like this today in the animated and computer generated videos. This is true talent and should be preserved as the award winner it is!

The video may not be in A+ condition but it's still highly enjoyable for all.",1205366400,,643,4.05511811023622

8011928,5,B0001FX56A,"One of the best movies ever made.  When you watch the real life actors, you will be astounded at what they were trained to do.  It is also a very sweet and heroic story, great for people of all ages in this often ugly world.",1507593600,,224,3.9555555555555557
8011929,2,B0001FX56A,"""Bill and Coo"" is cute, a vaudeville act with trained birds with a thin plot wrapped around their limited abilities. The main problem with the DVD is that it needs more restoring: the images are much too dark throughout. It was unique in its time (for those who couldn't get to a vaudeville show, and in the era of The Ed Sullivan Show with its many variety acts. Today, it's an anachronism.",1503360000,,391,4.444444444444445
8011930,5,B0001FX56A,"This movie is so cool!  And to think I would have never known about it if it wasn't for a Facebook post!
This is a movie completely acted out by birds, mostly Lovebirds.  There is a human narrating the actions that the birds are doing.
I was amazed that anyone could even train Lovebirds to ""act"" as I have had many, many Lovebirds starting in 1974, and none of them were ever inclined to do anything that I wanted them to do.
This movie is absolutely brilliant in what it accomplishes.  Only one thing really bothered me about the movie, and that was naming the crow, who was the villain, ""The Black Menace.""  Since this movie came out in 1948, I can't help but wonder whether that might be some kind of racially motivated observation.  That is just my opinion.  It should in no way stop you from enjoying this totally impressive and unusual film.
The film itself is a little grainy, due to the age of the original, I suppose.  However, I totally enjoyed watching this and I was very impressed by the bird ""actors.""
You should definitely watch this film if you are a parrot fan, especially those of you who are Lovebird owners!!",1496620800,,1129,4.451456310679611
8011931,5,B0001FX56A,"*************************** SPOILER ALERT!!! ******************************* SPOILER ALERT ************************

On New Year's day about 30 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to view a video tape I had made the night before by timer on my old VHS machine. I set the timer and went to bed before midnight.

The next day, after rewinding the tape, I became acquainted, once again, with a movie which had lodged itself in the brain of a 6-year-old over 3 decades earlier. It was definitely weird watching a story which seemed hauntingly familiar. But, it wasn't until the scene with the menacing crow entering town that I realized this lovely movie was the source of nightmares that had plagued my childhood into my early teen years. The details of the dream were never clear. All I could remember was a dark presence approaching, terrifying me; not waking me, as I recall, just disturbing me greatly, though it never manifested itself in my day to day life...that I know of.

It was one of two recurring dreams that I could not explain the origin. And ultimately outgrew. The other one is up for conjecture, but I believe it comes from memories from the womb!

But that's another story.",1479859200,,1191,4.91044776119403
