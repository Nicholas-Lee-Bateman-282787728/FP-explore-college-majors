4573094,1,B0055CP9UY,"As a collector of all things MST3K related, I can honestly say that, despite what others might say, Manos IS NOT the worst movie I've seen. Although Manos is awful in many ways it doesn't come close to ""santa and the ice cream bunny"". I think the only way to get this movie is the rifftrax version but then watching it without them is extremely painful. Watch this one (if you dare) and see if you don't agree.",1309824000,6,410,4.269230769230769
4573095,3,B0055CP9UY,"Decent episode of MST3K for sure. Probably not in the top 10 though a lot would disagree with this assessment. BUT, as a ""special edition"" release this seems (based on the description of what's included) to be a bit less-than special. More like Shout! trying to milk this cash-cow dry.

Personally I'll be holding out until 2015 when Shout! releases the ""Special-special Edition"" which will likely include actual DNA samples of the original MST3K cast, skin flakes from Mary Jo's 1993 chemical peel, a selection of Joel's childhood fingernail clippings, a Kevin Murphy urine sample, and a 30-second ""short"" on the making of Kevin's urine sample.",1309564800,8,645,5.084905660377358
4573096,5,B0055CP9UY,"Shout Factory has surprised us all once again with a new edition of Manos, the Hands of Fate ..one of , if not the most famous MST3K experiment of all time.
Manos is the most inept film out there, rivaling Creeping Terror, Beast of Yucca Flats in pure ineptitude. This also is one of the best episodes of MST3K - the jokes, the segments (Joel as Manos !) are hilarious. MST3K has given Manos all new heights of popularity ..it is the Citizen Kane of Bad Films..
Now as far as this release goes, it is packed with all new bonus features as reported on both the Satellite News and TV shows on DVD..
* Disc one will feature the classic MST3K episode, a featurette-""Group Therapy: Wherein Joel, Trace, Frank & Mary Jo relive the horror""-and the MST3K Hour wraps.
* Disc two will feature the original unMSTed movie, ""Jam Handy To the Rescue!"" A Daniel Griffith/Ballyhoo Production featurette (written by and starring Larry Blamire), BOTH parts of the short ""Hired!"" ""My (Educational) Short Life,"" an Interview with Joel Hodgson and-wait for it-""Hotel Torgo"". Also includes an exclusive mini-poster by artist Steve Vance.
Yes we get both versions of Manos on this disc...Ive seen Manos uncut and wrote a review about it already...there are a few shocking (sort of) moments that were cut for the film..
The question is ""Do I get this version - I already have 2 copies of Manos""
Many are on the fence due to the two previous releases..Obviously the new bonus features make it difficult for those of us who own the previous releases..
Personally speaking Im getting this because of the features
What I would suggest however so we as consumers do not need to own three DVDs of Manos
Port over the Poopie from the first release
OR
Release Santa Claus Conquers the Martians as a stand alone which would then (at least for me) unload the Essentials..
I do think this release will be the best of the three, but it really is a judgement call depending on your interest in the supplements and owning a NON MST3K version of Manos :)",1308355200,26,2015,4.6
4573097,5,B0055CP9UY,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is all about digging up the worst movies possible, and relentlessly making fun of them. But Joel and the robots may have met their match in ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" -- a tedious, fossilized movie with literally no redeeming characteristics at all. While the movie is too awful to even be amusing, it's kept funny by the running commentary.

On the Satellite of Love, Joel experiments with a module that causes all the bots to worship him -- and of course, once he removes it, they go right back to normal. Then comes the invention exchange, which is about as surreal as you'd expect, and then some.

Then the guys go into the theater for ""Manos, The Hands of Fate""... and yes, that comma SHOULD be a colon, but isn't. After being treated to a horrible short film about ""prospects,"" they are launched into the worst movie in the world: after a few hours of ""driving"" footage and some cop-related red herrings, a very boring all-American family arrives at a weird out-of-the-way house, occupied only by the knobby-kneed Torgo.

Amazingly, Torgo's creepy tics and constant babbling about ""the Master"" doesn't tip the family off that something weird might be going on in this place. And of course, eventually the bots begin to go insane from the sheer ineptitude of it all -- ""Hey look, there's a field! And another field! And another field!"" ""Oh yes, it's very scenic. It's just like a scene from... ""Manos, the Hands of Fate!"". Cue Tom's hysterical sobs.

Well, what can I say about the movie? It is a dusty, tedious, grotesquely dull lump of fossilized excrement and I can barely believe it was actually released in even one theater. An example: after a make-out session is interrupted by a cop, the girl pauses, glances around as if confused, rearranges her hair and then shrieks in a Britney Spears voice, ""Whah doncha leave us ALONE?""

I mean it. The movie is so bad that Frank and Dr. Forrester actually call to tell Joel and the bots that they feel sorry for them.

But the snark aimed at it is nothing short of BRILLIANT, especially since they have to make the worst movie EVER be entertaining just with their own wit. Of course, the bots spend most of the story alternately snarking (""Uh, that's not how you wear your Depends, Torgo"") and sobbing (""Ma-ma-ma-MANOS! THE HANDS OF FATE!""). And, of course, mocking the horrible production values, ghastly dialogue, and spasmodic acting.

This particular edition is a deluxe two-disk edition. For one thing, it has the original movie... which I don't recommend watching unless you have a bunch of drunk friends to do your own MST3K impression of. It also has some truly awful shorts, featurettes, an interview with Joel, ""Hotel Torgo,"" an interview with Bernie Rosenblum (aka Teenager in Car)/making-of story, and more. This sounds absolutely awesome.

""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" is unquestionably the worst movie ever released in theaters (although I'm sure there are some worse student films out there), but the Mystery Science Theater 3000 snark is classic. Ma-ma-ma-MANOS! THE HANDS OF FATE!",1308096000,18,3079,4.851428571428571
4573098,5,B0055CP9UY,"The Master wants you! This is a re-release of the most legendary of all MST3K episodes with cool new extra features. Manos: Hands Of Fate is not like other movies, you must see it to believe it, but only Joel and the 'Bots can get you through it.

Manos: Hands of Fate is a movie that is barely about anything, but here's a synopsis of what little story there is to it. A family of three, husband, wife and young daughter plus their little dog are looking for their vacation hotel. After an interminable driving sequence that goes nowhere, they end up in the middle of nowhere at a strange house run by a bizarre caretaker named, Torgo. The family makes the fateful decision to stay there for the night in spite of warnings from Torgo that ""The Master would not approve."" Their vacation kind of takes a downward turn from there!

Extra features on this new Shout! Factory release include:
Disc One: The classic MST3K episode plus
 - A featurette called, ""Group Therapy"", in which Joel, Trace, Frank & Mary Jo relive the horror.
 - The MST3K Hour wraps.

4573119,5,B0055CP9UY,"All hail MANOS, the worst movie ever made that was actually meant to be a ""good"" movie. It was made on a bet, and that guy lost.

MANOS, THE HANDS OF FATE makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like an EPIC. Ed Wood stands in the ranks of Truffaut and Hitchcock when compared to the clowns who made this flaming piece of dog flop.

4573120,4,B0055CP9UY,"I like it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old B-horror movie!!

""Manos the hands of fate"" is easily one of the dumbest movies you can ever sit through. It is unthinkable how this turd got made. Thank God it did. The film leaves you speechless.  Every so often, someone comes along and declares that such-and-such a film is, and I quote, ""THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!"" Usually the culprit is the latest big-budget, little-story extravaganza, or some popular work receiving its expected share of backlash. I always laugh a bit when people do this. Clearly, these innocent souls have never been exposed to the horror that is ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" Some films are so bad, they're good. Meaning ""fun"" or ""entertaining"" or at least ""interesting""... But few films can claim to be so dreadful, you actually feel physical pain while viewing them. So bad are these damned few that you don't experience them or watch them: you ""endure"" them. This is the mother of all such films!

Sure, plenty of movies are bad, but usually if you look hard enough, you can see some evidence that someone on board had at least a vague idea of how to make a film work. Not ""Manos."" There is not a single shred of competence to be found anywhere in it. It fails on every conceivable level: direction, acting, script, cinematography, sets, costumes, effects, sound, music. Throw in some of the most irritating and idiotic characters you'll ever see, a lot of disturbing sexual subtext, and the result is this pile of cinematic excrement.

""Manos the hands of fate"" is without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made. Its poorness is so extreme that of itself it is the film's strongest selling point. The script is non-existent, the acting makes Steven Seagal look like a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the editing could have been less horrendously botched by a blind Eskimo with no arms. It is also painfully slow. this film makes might barely last 70 minutes but you will feel like you've aged ten years by the end of it. That's what makes a film truly bad: the fact that despite its overbearing weaknesses it isn't even entertaining!

Many people look back at the sixties and think, with obvious resentment for today's cinematic output, that ""they don't make them like this anymore!"". Watching ""Manos..."" would cure any breed of hardcore nostalgia.

The story...well, I guess it's supposed to be one of those ""innocents get lost and stumble upon supernatural evil"" deals. Actually, it's more like an ""irritating family gets lost and stumbles upon a group of vague cultists and their creepy hired hand Torgo"" deal. Anyway, things happen, arguments go in circles, the mom of the family yells for her husband so much you wonder how she ties her shoes in the morning without him, the husband makes so many wrong decisions you wonder if he'd be any help with the shoe-tying thing, and the female cultists get into an extended wrestling match, revealing that under their diaphanous Grecian robes they're wearing modern bras and underwear.

The movie: This movie is usually ranked as one of the worst movies ever made. Why, you ask? Example #219: The movie producers built a leg contraption so that Torgo would look like a satyr with backwards bending legs. The only problem is that the actor playing Torgo wore the contraption backwards. So instead of looking like a satyr, he instead looks like his knees are swollen and the device made him walk very stiffly and unbalanced  The leading man is a Frank Zappa lookalike with only a fraction of the talent Zappa (being dead) has.  However, the real star of the film, Torgo (a goat-man), performed in some of the best walking-from-one-end-of-the-set-to-another scenes I have seen since 1950s Corman films.

There's much more, of course, but ""Manos"" is like a train wreck, or a natural disaster: I could describe it to you, but you'd never understand the full level of horror unless you witness it for yourself. So go ahead, watch it, I dare you. At least you can take comfort in the knowledge that, after you've seen it, nothing else you watch will be quite so bad.

Do yourself a favor. Sit back, grab a cold drink and enjoy one of the weirdest things ever put to celluloid. The master wants you to!

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
While on a road trip near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie, and their dog, Peppy, search for the ""Valley Lodge."" Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house ""while the Master is away."" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here. With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.

Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there is no phone in the house, the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.

Michael and Margaret stumble upon ""The Master"" and several women dressed in translucent nightgowns and later revealed to be his wives. They are all asleep. Torgo uses a stick to knock out Michael, and then ties Michael to a pole, after dragging him to it, and The Master suddenly comes to life. His wives also awaken, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. The Master decides he must sacrifice Torgo and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, ""Manos."" When The Master leaves, his wives engage in further argument that soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand.

Torgo succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by The Master. The Master stops the fight, and has his first wife tied to a pole to be sacrificed. Torgo is laid on a stone bed, where he is attacked by The Master's other wives, but this in itself does not prove fatal. Evoking some mysterious power, The Master severs and horribly burns Torgo's left hand. Torgo runs off into the darkness, waving the burning stump that remains. The Master laughs maniacally and goes to look for the family and subsequently sacrifices his first wife.

The family runs off into the desert. When a rattlesnake appears in front of them, Michael shoots it, attracting the attention of nearby deputies. Margaret and Michael are later convinced to return to the Master's house, where the Master welcomes them. Michael fires several shots into The Master's face at point-blank range, but they have no effect. The screen fades to black, likely indicating that The Master has again applied his hypnotic power.

An undisclosed amount of time later, an entranced Michael greets two new lost travelers. Margaret and Debbie have become wives of The Master. The film concludes with Michael echoing Torgo's line of ""I take care of the place while the Master is away.""

The camera being used could only film scenes of a specific length, which is why the scenes are either too long and drawn out (someone staring in confusion) or ends with a quick, startling jump cut.

For the MST3K crew, this movie is an embarrassment of riches. And I mean embarrassment! The movie was filmed by a fertilizer salesman in Texas, and he definitely managed to create a big pile of his own product.

The ""plot"" loosely revolves around a family vacationing- inexplicably in one of the least scenic, least populated parts of Texas- when they get turned around and end up needing a place to stay for the night. They end up at a creepy old mansion where the caretaker insists that the Master wouldn't like them staying there. Despite this obvious warning, the unlikeable husband bullies his way in and demands his family be allowed to stay.

I can't decide what is worst about this movie. The hysterical wife? The incompetent husband? The little girl's voice, overdubbed by a grown woman? Or is it the Master's harem of wives, dressed in cheesy KMart nightgowns and spouting stilted dialogue? Maybe it's the fact that the ""beast"" that plays the Master's hellhound is obviously a friendly family dog.

You'll have to see this one to believe it.",1383264000,,1530,4.895752895752896

I DO NOT, however, recommend watching the ""un-mistied"" version. Without Joel & the Bots to de-toxify the mess, it can be painful.

This is one of my top 3 favorite MST3K episodes (with Pod People and Angels Revenge).  Joel and the bots had a hard time riffing on this one and it's easy to see why.  The film leaves you speachless.

The brilliance of this episode is the fact that Joel and the bots often seem as bewhildered as the audience watching this cinematic abortion.  Long periods of ""hmm..."" ""uh..."" and ""wha..."" seem to space this film from begining to end.  You know it's bad when the best riffs come from just repeating the title in an incredulous voice.

4573331,4,B0055CP9UY,"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie format, I like to review each part of the episode as a good or bad part can save or ruin the entire episode.

The movie: This movie is usually ranked as one of the worst movies ever made. Why, you ask? Example #219: The movie producers built a leg contraption so that Torgo would look like a satyr with backwards bending legs. The only problem is that the actor playing Torgo wore the contraption backwards. So instead of looking like a satyr, he instead looks like his knees are swollen and the device made him walk very stiffly and unbalanced (points very well mocked by Joel and the bots). You would think a movie with such bad acting, directing, ... well bad everything, would be good in a funny mocking way.  But excluding Torgo(and his accompanying ""Torgo's Theme"") and a few hilaroius scenes due to unintentional production errors, the movie is very boring and nearly unwatchable.  I do not know if I could have sat through it without the riffing.

Segments: The opening segment is funny and there is a pre-Mike Mike appearance in the last segment. The rest are ok. However the mads do something unusual during the movie which I loved.

Riffs: The riffs are funny and evenly spread out.  Joel and the bots have a lot of fun pointing out the terrible parts of the movie - which is basically the entire movie.

Overall: Every since I started watching MST3k, all I have ever heard from other fans is that ""Manos"" was the BEST EPISODE EVER!!! While ""Manos"" might be the worst movie MST3k ever viewed (IMO the worst was ""Batwoman""), I found it to be a very good and very funny episode - but clearly not a top 10 episode.  If you do plan to watch a lot of MST3k episodes, then this episode is actually a required episode as some of the characters are mentioned and shown in other episodes (in fact Torgo might be the most called back character).  But please be prepared to be underwhelemed by the hype that has somehow surrounded this episode.

Other: The opening is the conclusion of the ""Hired!"" short. The riffing is hilarious and this is one of the better shorts.",1341878400,2,2124,4.479274611398964

4573337,4,B0055CP9UY,"This Shout Factory 2-disc DVD is a huge upgrade from the Rhino DVD version of MST3K: Manos The Hands of Fate. That DVD is still worth keeping, though. Manos The Hands of Fate(1966) is one of the worst movies ever made, but it has turned into a cult classic. I've seen home videos with men and women impersonating Torgo. This Shout Factory DVD has the MSTied version of Manos The Hands of Fate. The original 1966 version of the film is on the second disc. It looks like it was mastered off an old public domain videotape. There's interviews with Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl. There are clips from the MST3K Hour version of Manos The Hands of Fate with Mike Nelson playing a Jack Perkins-ish host. We get to see both parts of Joel and the Bots poking fun of the 1940's short Hired. The documentary Hotel Torgo is an extra on disc two. There's a featurette called Jam Handy to the Rescue. There's a Manos mini poster painted by Steve Vance. The Hotel Torgo documentary has interviews with film expert Richard Brandt, the judge who loaned his inn to writer/producer Hal Warren, and Manos actor Bernie Rosenblum. I have to warn you guys. Rosenblum curses a lot!
 Manos The Hands of Fate(1966) is heavily flawed on an artistic and technical level. Even on a budget of $19,000, it still flopped at the box office. Mary Jo Pehl of Best Brains claims the film feels like David Lynch's Eraserhead(1977). It's a dark, bleak, joyless film. There's some good R&B and rock & roll songs in the movie. It's a mystery who performed them. These could have been songs from Warren's LP collection. The credits claim the film has an original music score by Russ Huddleston and Robert Smith. Even with filler scenes, Manos struggled to reach 74 minutes. One of the actresses/models broke her foot on the set. She was cast as one of the Master's wives. Warren filmed filler footage of her kissing Bernie Rosenblum in a sports car so she could still be in the movie. Diane Mahree is quite lovely as Michael's wife. She had natural beauty. The late John Reynolds played Torgo. He commited suicide in the Fall of Autumn 1966. Tom Neyman played The Master in the film. He also designed the ""Manos robe"" and the self-portrait of The Master and his dog. Hal Warren promised the cast and crew a share of the profits from the film in lieu of a salary. The film didn't make any money! The dogs in the film were paid with dog food and Jackie Neyman Jones was paid with a new bicycle. Rosenblum claims the 1966 debut of Manos was a disaster. The sound was garbled in the theater. It didn't clear up until the cops bother two teenagers. People in the theater poked fun of the movie. The cast and crew left the theater to avoid humiliation. Manos was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1992 or so and it brought Manos back into the mainstream. Hal Warren made Manos The Hands of Fate(1966) to win a bet with screenwriter Stirling Silliphant. Manos The Hands of Fate(1966) is a train wreck of a movie that you have to witness for yourself.",1330041600,3,3040,4.517241379310345
4573338,4,B0055CP9UY,"Though this 2 DVD set contains both the MST3k version and the Original Film plus great extras, its kind of a letdown that the original film does not contain the full song ""Love Inside this Magic Circle.""  This is one of my favorite songs along with the final song ""Forgetting You.""  They have a nice jazz feel to them.  I wonder why the MSTied print contains the full song and the original they released in this set does not.  The original here sounds like the soundtrack was recorded on a record that skipped and omitted some of the lyrics, while the MSTied version (if you listen between the riffing) sounds pretty clear and complete (no skipping, no omitting).  How did they get such a clean copy to begin with?  Overall, an excellent set, unless you're a die-hard fan of the first song, like me.",1326672000,,799,4.513888888888889
4573349,5,B0055CP9UY,"I was first introduced to this MST3K episode through my brother's VHS copy. It was always an exercise in endurance to try to make it through this movie even with Joel + the Bots' quality riffing. To paraphrase a riff in this episode, every shot in this movie looks like somebody's last known photograph. This is probably the most astute observation in the history of the show.

The great majority of MST3K fans already own this episode in one form or another, and those who haven't will find this to be an excellent buy. However, many are wondering about whether purchasing this special edition is warranted if you already one of the previously released DVD's. For this reason I'll give a rundown of the special features.

Disk One has the MST3K episode and a few extras. One of the special features is the MST Hour Wraps for the episode presented like the were for other episodes on previous DVD's. The other feature is an interview with Frank, Trace, Joel, and Mary called ""Group Therapy"" in which they have a 20 minute discussion about the episode with some interesting insights about why Manos is considered a noted episode for the series. This is a pretty basic discussion but some interesting points are made.

Disk Two has the un-MSTied Manos (I'm not planning on watching this anytime soon) as well as the bulk of the special features.

The best of these is ""Hotel Torgo"", a 30 minute documentary about the movie that is very well done. They actually interview a crew member who provides the most information on what it was like to work on the movie. My favorite parts were when they visited the few filming locations. It is a very surreal experience to just see what these locations look like today (spoiler alert: they don't look like much).

There is also a set of special features on Jam Handy. One is a documentary. Another reviewer mentioned being turned off by how silly this documentary was and I'd have to agree. I understand what they were doing but I think it could have been cut down to about 10-15 minutes and still have all the interesting information about the company that they did provide. Decent info but got too bogged down in its own concept. However, there is a great 10 min. interview with Joel on here where he touches on his personal history with these types of shorts in elementary school and such. The other special features on Jam Handy are not particularly notable.

The last special feature includes the riffed shorts Hired Parts I and II... except now they are merged together to match the original short. Most MSTies have seen these shorts many times but it is interesting to see them back to back. I couldn't even tell when it jumped from Part I to Part II.

In conclusion, whether this set is worth buying to you or not is directly related to how much you care about Manos. I thought the documentary about Manos was great, so if you are interested in the film, definitely pick this up. A few of the other special features might be enough to make it worthwhile to you as well.",1324339200,2,3016,4.584415584415584
4573350,1,B0055CP9UY,"I'm a huge MST fan owning 15 volumes of the 4 DVD sets of the series. I love them all. But I do not recommend this for anyone. The movie is so bad that Joel and the bots truly struggle with the riffing that makes MST so great. The movie is so lethargic that I fell asleep during all 3 attempts to watch it. I finally got through it and saw the lame ending. Seriously, if you love MST and you want more great riffing by Joel and the bots, put your money in another MST feature. This one is really lame. The only value I place on owning this is that I know for certain that I have in my possession a copy of the worst movie ever made. So, if you're a collector, that may be the only reason you would want this - because this contains a second DVD of the original unriffed movie. When I get together with my family, we love watching my MST collection...but I would never put them through the excruciating experience of watching this. If you have trouble falling asleep, this would have you snoozing in 10 minutes! So, that may be the only other reason I can think of why anyone would want this.

The tribute uses archived footage of Jam Handy himself explaining his early inspirations to make edu-tainment films.

There's also an interview with the last surviving cast member of ""Manos"", (or the last one you can find), with a lot of interesting, funny, and sad stories about the film and the fates of the cast.

And if you're feeling particularly masochistic, you can see ""Manos"" uncut and unfiltered.  But it appears to be a shorter cut from the one in the episode.

The ""Group Therapy"" feature, which has Joel, Frank, Trace and Mary Jo reminiscing about the discovery of this particular pelicula is great fun. I wish Mike Nelson was also part of the discussion, but his absence in some recent bonus material makes me wonder if there's bad blood between he and Hodgson. Regardless, he can be found in the hilarious ""MST Hour"" host segments, which are a riot. The second disk features the unadorned original theatrical cut of ""Manos"" and is a tough nugget to chew, but again the bonus stuff is swell. The documentary about the actual making of ""Manos"" is pretty fascinating (and a good companion piece to the article that ran in Entertainment Weekly (June 10, 2005 issue), and disc 2 also reunites the Jam Handy short ""Hired,"" which ran in two parts on MST3K and as a consequence has been unavailable in total on DVD prior.

Also included is the 2004 documentary ""Hotel Torgo"", which tracks down the (surprisingly few) surviving cast and crew members and the house it was filmed at.

No one who worked on this movie ever went on to a career in their chosen field, and supposedly there were many accidents.  The ""kissing couple"" (gag) was limited to the car because the actress had a bad cold, and was so weak that she could barely move.  View at your own risk.",1507507200,,842,4.543046357615894

8457906,5,B0055CP9UY,"El Paso salesman Harold Warren wanted to make a movie, so in 1966 he did, and committed all the sins an amateur filmmaker can make. MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE is plagued by bad cinematography, bad photography, flat acting, and no particular understanding of what it means to cut to continuity. While the plot structure isn't bad as far as lost-travelers-who-stumble-across-satanic-cult movies go, gratuitous shots of an unrelated couple necking by the side of the highway, and a female harem getting into catfights, seem only to pad the plot. Naturally, all this was a godsend for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 staff when they rescued this flick from obscurity in 1993 and proceeded to slash it into ribbons on the show, creating one of their best send-ups of one of the worst (an IMDb 1.9) films ever made.  Because of that, MANOS has wormed its incompetent little way into the hearts of bad-movie lovers everywhere.  (Just mention Torgo to one of us Misties and you're apt to get an imitation of the halting-voiced goat-man who serves The Maas-ter.)

Since MANOS was also sent up by the RiffTrax crew in 2013, the question always arises as to which is the better version. Both are great fun, but I'd have to say this one, if only because the later version is unwilling to poach too much from this one. The Mistie MANOS is a great lampoon of an absolutely awful movie, and would make a fine addition to any Mistie/RiffTrax fan's library.  Note that this version includes a keepcase, a large-postcard-sized Miniposter, both riffed and unriffed versions of the movie, a brief chat with the MST talents who brought MANOS to the little screen, even a 24-minute documentary from 2004 about the phenomenon.  Misties who want to go even further should also consider buying the recent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-with-Manos-The-Hands-of-Fate-How-I-was-the-Child-Star-of-the-Worst-Movie-Ever-Made-and-Lived-to-Tell-the-Story/dp/1593939221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up with Manos: The Hands of Fate: How I was the Child Star of the Worst Movie Ever Made and Lived to Tell the Story</a>, written by the grown-up little girl in the movie, which corrects some common errors concerning MANOS and even explains why auteur Hal Warren put the necking couple into his brainchild.

8457908,5,B0055CP9UY,"In this reviewer's humble opinion, the is the best MST3K episode available.  Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo are at the top of their games in ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"".  There's so much here to riff on in this turkey that there needs to be a sequel.  Manservant Torgo should have his own spin off - he's that good.  Truly one of the worst movies ever made (move over Ed Wood), the MST3K boys make this a wonderful experience that make you forget how awful the film making was.
If you're new to Mystery Science Theater 3000, this episode is a wonderful place to start.  You'll be a fan for life!",1454544000,3,589,4.27027027027027

While this is the kind of movie that is only viewed drunk at 2am after some idiot you're not sure why you're friends with says, ""You what would be so funny right now?"", the best way to actually make it through this entire trainwreck of an incomprehensible plot is to watch the Mystery Science Theater version.
You should buy both, the original to torture your friends with, the MST3k one to watch yourself.",1449792000,,443,4.620253164556962
