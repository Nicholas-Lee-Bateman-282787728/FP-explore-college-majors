8078642,3,B000AJJN7M,"If you remember this TV show from years gone by, then you'll love to watch this again as I did.  The only drawback, and its a big one for me, is that it looks like it was transferred from a cheap VHS copy with no enhancements made. So if you can put up with fair video quality, you'll enjoy this.  PS. If you think that this stuff is too old and in poor quality to start with , take a look at what they did with the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies of the 40's(they recently issued the complete set; black cover with silver writing). The picture quality is amazing for its age. If one wants to expend the effort and time, wonders can be done. Its obvious that NW Passage was done cheap & dirty.  Sorry to disappoint.",1179187200,4,721,4.172661870503597
