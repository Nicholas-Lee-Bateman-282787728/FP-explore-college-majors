3890020,5,B002AMVEHY,"I received my MISTER ED, First Season, DVD set over the weekend.  While I have only watched a few episodes, I must say it is of excellent quality.  A few reviewers here have complained about a few syndicated prints being used that are a minute to a few minutes shorter.  This is actually explained in the ""bonus"" material by Alan Young (""Wilbur"") without really trying.  For it's entire run, Mister Ed was run in syndication!  Once they lost their commercial sponsorship in the first season, they found other ways of funding the show.  They were never sponsored or directly supported financially by any of the major networks!  I was very surprised to learn this.  Six years on the air without a network sponsor.  Sounds as if they paid the networks to carry the show.

The sound and video quality here are excellent.

Here's the rest of the seasons being released on DVD ... and soon!

3890021,5,B002AMVEHY,"At last, the first season of Mister Ed is on DVD. The show began in January 1961 in Syndication, then was picked by CBS for the rest of its run. This four disk set has 26 episodes that made up season 1. The transfers look good, and the sound is good. Extras include commentary from the show's stars, Alan Young and Connie Hines on the pilot episode. And a half hour feature where Alan Young and Connie Hines talk about the show. Young and Hines talk about how they got their parts, how the show got a sponsor in syndication, how CBS eventually picked up the show, about how Allan Lane came to be the voice of Ed, and how Ed was made to talk. Overall a great set.

As for the edited episodes, that does not bother me a bit. Life is too short to be bothered by such trivial things. A similar situation occured with Father Knows Best Season 1. Thankfully Shout has continued to release that show, and its following seasons have been complete. If this release tanks, it is possible NO MORE SEASONS WILL BE RELEASED!!! We would never get to see the episodes with Clint Eastwood, Mae West, and the one where Ed bats against Sandy Kofax and hits a homerun. The shot of Ed sliding into home plate is the single funniest moment of the series. So, Shout Factory, please continue to release the entire series.

How now, brown cow.",1254960000,10,1319,4.357723577235772
3890022,5,B002AMVEHY,"The complete season is Mr Ed is a throwback to TV worth watching. This simple premous of a Talking animal is cute. Think Francis the talking mule (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Francis-the-Talking-Mule-Vol-1-Francis-the-Talking-Mule-Francis-Goes-to-the-Races-Francis-Goes-to-West-Point-Francis-Covers-the-Big-Town/dp/B0001FVDQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Francis the Talking Mule, Vol. 1 (Francis the Talking Mule / Francis Goes to the Races / Francis Goes to West Point / Francis Covers the Big Town)</a>) and you know Mr ED.

However the intelligent writing and good acting makes this sitcom worth watching and laughing. It dates itself, but it is , to the quote the ad, TV WORTH WATCHING.

This four disk set is all 26 episodes of the first season of ED. The neat extra features of this set is audio commentary on the  first episode with Alan (Wilber) Young and Connie (Carol) Hines. Also a documentary about the show itself with  Toung and Hines.

It is a good that the whole family can watch and enjoy

3890023,5,B002AMVEHY,"I read from a review on dvd talk that 8 episodes might be edited. Busy Wife, Kiddy Park, Stable for Three, Ed the Lover, The Pageant Show, The Aunt, Little Boy, and The Contest all run about 22 minutes, with the rest of the episodes running 25 minutes. I think some episodes have been edited just a warning.",1253145600,7,307,4.310344827586207
3890024,5,B002AMVEHY,"Just adorable.  The famous Mister Ed was always the smart one, the humans just weren't as clever or as funny as Mister Ed.  When the TV show involves goings on with the humans and not Mister Ed, the show suffers.  There's no doubt that Ed was the star and the best episodes are those that showcase the horse, of course.",1249862400,3,319,4.283333333333333
3890025,5,B002AMVEHY,"Shout Factory gets us! They have been doing a super job releasing classic TV shows - Mr. Ed, Patty Duke, etc. I can't wait for their release of Mr. Ed! I already have both of the previous MGM DVD releases and they are crystal clear (so clear in fact you can notice the seams in the astro turf lawn - I guess the studio never anticipated a DVD release of their show, so those details were not addressed) - so Shout Factory's release should be just as good or better. I'll let you know when it arrives ....

Well Shout Factory needs to be better. After praising them for other classic TV releases they pull a fast one on us and switch out 8 episodes with shorter syndicated versions! Shame on you! I just hope if they plan on releasing the remaining seasons that they take more care and give the collectors what they want - and pay for!

If Amazon would let me, I would drop my rating down by at least one star! Especially since they only put 2 episodes on the last disc, so time was not an issue here.",1249689600,2,1000,4.176165803108808
3890026,5,B002AMVEHY,"""A horse is a horse, of course, of course, and no one can talk to a horse, of course, unless, of course, if the very horse is the famous Mister Ed"".....this is classic TV at it's VERY best and when sitcoms were family friendly, and very funny...with a moral to the story at the end. Mister Ed was one of the sitcoms I never missed, and hearing Mister Ed say...""Well, Wilber"" was always funny when he tried to explain his actions. I'm glad they preserved this sitcom and finally released it on DVD.",1249603200,,497,4.354838709677419
3890027,5,B002AMVEHY,"How odd that we're suddenly getting such an avalanche of old TV shows in complete seasons - ""One Step Beyond"", ""Bonanza"", and now ""Mr. Ed"" all due out in coming months. These are old favorites that were always either in the public domain or in incomplete collections or both. Maybe people are tired of having half of every channel's schedule filled with either paid programming (Internet Millions! Homes for three hundred dollars! etc.) in which you know you're being lied to or reality TV (Bridezillas - young women dressed in flowing traditional garb and acting like rutting pigs) in which you hope you're being lied to. You'd hate to think humanity has come to this.

To fill the gap many of us have turned to old favorite TV shows on DVD  from the 50's, 60's, and 70's. Mr. Ed is one of those shows. Following a storyline similar to the ""Francis the Talking Mule"" series of films, the animal in question (the horse, Mr. Ed) will only speak to one person - his owner Wilbur, an architect who has an office in the barn where Mr. Ed lives. Mr. Ed doesn't limit himself just to giving advice to Wilbur. Mr. Ed has definite ideas of how he wants to run his own life. He might fancy himself an author or a potential star of the screen, or he might take off on a humane mission to buy his mother when he learns she is a plow horse. As a result, Wilbur is often left in a ridiculous position and not in the good graces of his wife, Carol or his neighbors.

The whole thing is good clean silly fun in the tradition of Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Petticoat Junction. Believe it or not there are still many of us who enjoy such entertainment.",1245456000,69,1649,4.4
3890028,5,B002AMVEHY,"Just about anyone that was alive and old enough to watch TV in the 1960's loved this show. If you have never seen Mister Ed it has humor on two levels both for kids and adults. Kids will love Mister Ed and adults will also. It is very funny and spoofs just about everything. Season 1 has 26 episodes and the previously released Best of Mister Ed Volume 1 only has four shows from Season 1 with the Best of Mister Ed Volume 2 having none indicating 22 of the 26 shows will be new to DVD.

The Season 1 shows on the previously released Best of Mister Ed Volume 1 DVD are:
1) The First Meeting,
2) Ed, the Songwriter,
3) Psychoanalyst Show, and
4) Wilbur Sells Ed

Season 1 ran from January to July 1961. The entire six year Mister Ed series was filmed in Black and White. The quality on the Best of Mister Ed DVD's was very high and is assumed that it will be on the Complete Season 1 DVD also. These shows are timeless, as good and funny today as they were when originally broadcast.",1245456000,38,982,4.136125654450262

3890065,1,B002AMVEHY,"As others have mentioned, there are eight syndicated episodes here missing about three minutes each, which is a travesty alone. But making matters even worse is that the cut episodes are sped up and play about 5% faster than the uncut versions so that another commercial could be crammed in when played in syndication. It's hardly noticeable unless you compare both side by side, but it's insidious nonetheless. All episodes play at normal speed and full length in the complete series set, but the tradeoff there is that the bitrate (quality) is significantly lower. So you can't really win with this bungled release of a classic show.",1455148800,,635,4.94392523364486

Who couldn't laugh at the crazy antics of screwball horse who only talks to one man, and that man's seemingly inability and bungling manner in which he would have to explain to all those around him the impossible interactions of a talking horse.  Alan Young and Connie Hines were great together on this show, not to mention their relationship with the neighbors.  I do have to say that the Addisons were a much better fit on the show.  Roger and Kay were a much better fit.  When the show changed the neighbors to The Kirkwoods the show lost a bit of its wholesome edge and quirky humor.  I still watched, but I never really liked the replacement of Roger and Kay Addison with Gordon and Winnie Kirkwood. This show made me wanna buy a horse...lol!!",1424217600,,897,4.47239263803681

The writers did a great job, the jokes are spot on, fast and furious.  But there are still some funny shows on TV today.  What makes this show standout is you really get a soft spot for Ed and Wilbur.  Alan Young loved that old horse, and it shows.  Everyone put their heart into this how, including Ed!

I hadn't seen this show in years and wondered if it would still seem fun and fresh, fact is yes!  Like a fine wine it just gets better as you get older!  Thanks Alan Young, Connie, Ed and the rest for making something special that stands the test of time.

There is kind of a feel good spirit when your watching Mr. Ed that just bubbled out of all the series during this time,a time we have lost forever,but now through TGG you can experience this great show,my only fear is that after three seasons TGG does not do what the Genius Entertainment did and only do three seasons of HIghway To Heaven and then stop,I hope TGG does all six episodes of Mr. Ed.

3890203,5,B002AMVEHY,"The year is 2014, the world is full of filthy, stupid, and psychotic TV shows.

One lone horse rides in to save the day, Mister Ed.

That alone makes for a better story premise than ninety percent of what's on TV nowadays.

The only show I watch is The Walking Dead, and that show's getting stale.

My problem with TV shows nowadays is that every other joke is a fart joke, sex joke, or death joke - the writing is horrible, in high school I wrote a Splinter Cell Fan fiction novel that was a hundred times better than most TV shows.

The fact is that TV shows nowadays can't hold a candle to the classics like Mister Ed.

The show holds up so well even after almost fifty years, the comedy is cartoonish (Loony Tunes not South Park), the characters are cute, and it was all around entertaining.

On a final note, does anyone else think Kay Addison was the perfect MILF?

Yeah, I guess I'm a twenty four year old pervert.

3890204,5,B002AMVEHY,"Cast with an absolutely hilarious comedy team. Addison becomes the 2nd star of this show with his direct approach comments about Ed and Wilbur's absent-minded antics. I also love seeing all the actors that are now in their 70-80's or sadly gone in their prime. Never seeing them as young actors it really is a shock sometimes realizing who they are. The episode with Ed trying to get rid of Clint Eastwood because his horse is so studly has to be my favorite. What makes the show so funny is that we would think it might be great for animals to talk all the while thinking they would be pleasant when in actuality they would probably be more like Ed!!

3890258,5,B002AMVEHY,"Mister Ed is a horse. He is possibly the most famous horse in the world, due to his show's six-season run that has been constantly replayed in syndication for over half a century. But what do we really know about Mister Ed?

He is impetuous. He's single-minded in purpose. He's a tad lazy, loving to both sleep and eat. He doesn't like heavy riders. He's a Palomino who claims to be eight years old. He's a hypochondriac. He reads the newspaper, comic books and a select number of magazines. He loves watching the late movie show on his portable 60's era television. He has a real eye for the fillies. He loves carrots. He remains actively engaged with the ASPCA. And, oh yes, he can talk.

But, he only talks to Wilbur. Actually, that's not quite true, even though Mister Ed constantly repeats that claim to Wilbur (""You know I only talk to YOU!""). Mister Ed shows little to no hesitation in using the telephone to phone-order some dalliance, contact the ASPCA with a complaint, or eavesdrop on the telephone party line to catch the local gossip. (Mister Ed loves to eavesdrop on gossip, so we should add that to the above list.) All this means that, indeed, Mister Ed actually DOES talk to quite a number of people, but only when he can do so without revealing his equine identity (the exception is that he will, on occasion, talk to kids, because, in Ed's own words, ""Who'll believe a kid, anyway?""). But with Wilbur Post, Mister Ed's owner, he's as garrulous a horse as you'll ever find.

And speaking of talking, did you perhaps notice the very thing that is so obvious that you might never think about it: Mister Ed's very first word to us, in every single episode, is ""Hello!"" ""Hello! I'm Mister Ed."" The first word of each show, then, breaks Ed's own rule, because he speaks to each of us while we look at him, standing in his stable. (Cool piece of subterfuge, huh?)

Like many people in the United States, I grew up watching Mister Ed. (His name is always presented as ""Mister Ed,"" without abbreviated spelling, never as ""Mr. Ed."") As a child, the show enchanted me and made me feel like I was part of a special, magical universe. When my wife and I recently started watching the episodes on DVD, I hadn't seen the show for decades, and I wondered if I could enjoy it as much as my memories would lead me to believe. But it was easy to see right from the start that the magic was still there. I admit to being caught off guard by this: the thought of a grown man my age watching a show that ostensibly was aimed at children seemed to be an exercise that would end in boredom and a perhaps create a little dent on my childhood reminiscences.

But the magic is still there. There is absolutely something special about this most special of shows. It's engaging. It's funny. It's even sometimes thought provoking. And much like the original Andy Griffith Show, there's even an occasional lesson about life woven into the story.

The horse Mister Ed is simply gorgeous, even by horse standards. His face is the envy of horses everywhere, and the director and filing crew found a way to bring out Ed's beauty in most every scene. As a Palomino, Mister Ed is a golden chestnut brown, but for reasons that I can't fully explicate, he is best portrayed on the ""silver"" screen. It's also apparent from watching these shows afresh as an adult, that Wilbur (Alan Young) was genuinely fond of Mister Ed, and Mister Ed fond of him. That very real affection clearly shows in many episodes: it's not something that can be ""acted"" over such a long period of time. Mister Ed (real name, Bamboo Harvester), too, was an exceptionally intelligent animal who was able to do tricks and tasks that likely would have been much more difficult, or sometimes, impossible, for other horses to learn, and these skills are put to great use in the show, often with few filming cuts, or other camera trickery.

So, what is it about this show that makes it so special, and that has kept it in constant play around the world for now over half a century? We'll, it's in part the magic of the concept. Mister Ed as the prankster who is always getting Wilbur into trouble because he has called on the phone to order new furniture for his stable, or to call the ASPCA because he's not getting enough carrots. Or by sabotaging Wilbur's guests at the house because Mister Ed is missing out on the daily attention he insists upon. Or stealing Addison's delicious homegrown apples from the backyard using a variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques but nearly always found out.

Perhaps also it is watching Mister Ed carry out and execute tasks that make you wonder how it could have been done. He was a truly talented horse, and some of these actions are mesmerizing, even for horse aficionados that know all about horses from first-hand contact.

And, undeniably, Mister Ed's gorgeous face is enough to steal every single scene--and I mean every single one in which he appears--regardless of who else is present. Maybe this, too, is one of the reasons for the enduring nature of the show. Mister Ed is so gorgeous that it is hard to understand why he ultimately has so much trouble with the fillies. But it is hilarious to watch Ed with his passing love interests, sometimes resulting in Ed demanding height-increasing horseshoes (because the filly he likes is taller than he), and other times prompting him to change his diet to shed a few pounds so he'll be able to complete with the other suitors aiming for the same filly.

As a kid, the show entranced me with it's magic of a talking horse, and as an adult, I still find that impact, but I now as an adult note that one of the things that makes the show laugh-out-loud funny at points is the biting sarcasm and the great one-liners that Mister Ed constantly uses. The writing for Mister Ed's dialogue is simply excellent. How can an adult sit there and laugh at this? But you will. Mister Ed comes up with some truly hilarious lines, often delivered with defiance and irony. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the show works so well: the deep and droll delivery of Mister Ed's lines (voiced by the un-credited Allan ""Rocky"" Lane) works so well and is so engaging that its difficult not to be hanging on every word.

As far as the technical quality of these DVD's, they are clear as anything, with only an occasional episode with less video quality (perhaps the master for those few episodes were lost). If you are watching these with an up-sampling DVD player and a flat screen TV, you're likely to be as amazed as I with the film clarity of the show. The sound track is general good, as well, with only an occasional imperfection on a couple of episodes. But for the vast majority of episodes, the video and audio are excellent. Mister Ed never looked so good.

Mister Ed is simply a delightful show. Don't worry about how they got his lips to move at just the right moments in extended conversations with nearly no camera cuts, or how Ed can call the house from the barn if the two phones are on the same line, or how Ed can type on the typewriter with a nose that would have simultaneously hit seven keys with each tap. Just accept it. It's magical. And it's not just for the kids. They will love it, but so will you.",1342742400,10,7255,4.521341463414634

While the other episodes seem to be all there, they do not appear on the discs in the order in which they were filmed or shown.  That is confusing in some instances.
Also the menu pages are primitive to say the least.  You cannot chose a particular chapter from the main menu but you always have to start with the first episode on that disc and then go from there to the next one until you reach the one you want.  That is very inconvenient.

While I remember seeing Mr. Ed when it first aired and in reruns a little later on I didn't remember which seasons and episodes were the funniest.  Although some reviewers here have complained about the edited episodes on disc 1(and rightfully so) this Season 1 is still a big winner and a super deal for less than $20.  The picture is clear on a non blue ray dvd player and its super entertaning (that is if you like Mr ED and his great inteligence and personality).  I just finished watching all the episodes and I loved just about all of them. There were no playback problems/No one sided discs/ And great case with an individual spot for each disc.  Where do I sign ! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the edited first episodes (no theme song words) and whatever else was missing. Although while not condoning this type of production all said episodes were still super funny and entertaining to me.

This first set of Season One is really the origin of what the show became in the next few seasons but it is still hilariously funny stuff. I adored the dry wit of Larry Keating, who played Addison the dour next door neighbor of the Posts/Ed. Just to hear Addison declare Ed ""an old nag"" and see Ed's reaction is worth the price of this DVD set. Truly a clever and original sitcom of the 60's. Read Alan Young's autobiographies, ""Mister Ed and Me"" and ""Mister Ed and Me and More"" (also available on Amazon) which are great and good companion books to the series. But of course the star and reason to watch is Ed. His humor and wisdom are timeless, one of the funniest shows was ""Ed and the LA Dodgers"" (not in this first season) in which he hit a homer, ran the bases and slid home. Check it out on YouTube.

Mister Ed - The Complete First Season is a 4-disc (single-sided) set featuring all 26 episodes in Full Frame (1.33:1) video and English mono audio. The discs are housed in slimcases all inside a slim outer box. Special Features include Interviews and Commentary on the Pilot Episode with stars Alan Young and Connie Hines, plus a booklet with episode descriptions and trivia. The picture and sound quality is decent, given the age of the show. Though there are no scene selections, there are chapter breaks for the episodes which you can skip thru using your remote.

*Unfortunately, due to reasons privy only to Shout! Factory, 8 of the episodes are edited from the original broadcast versions. Despite this, I still recommend this Season One set to devoted fans of series. The humor within the episodes of Mister Ed (thanks to the show's writers and a great cast including Allan ""Rocky"" Lane as the voice of Mister Ed) remains timeless and still connects with TV viewers of all ages on several levels. Also, know that following season sets contain nothing but unedited episodes, plus more great extras.  Here are the episodes and how the discs will be configured, plus approximate runtimes:

Younger viewers will enjoy watching one of TV's funniest comedies.",1262476800,,237,4.9
3890282,2,B002AMVEHY,"So disappointed!! Complete??, my ""horses butt!!""
Did they think we wouldn't notice??!!

We waited all these years through VHS and the best of on DVD's all the while wanting Complete Uncut Episodes Season by Season, and now this.
For me it's unthinkable heresy!!

8 episodes are only 22 minutes long!!! Which means that almost one third of the episodes in this season one set are cheating the viewer out of over 3 minutes of footage. Footage that ties scenes together, and without such makes one wonder what is missing... Funny moments, tender moments, great comedy, great acting, and they're missing.

Wonderful words laid down by talented writers, making one think, what did the great Larry Keating do in those missing minutes, how about Alan Young, Connie Hines, and Edna Skinner, not to forget Allan (Rocky) Lane??!!  Incredible on screen chemistry left out because they couldn't take the time to find or put together a complete episode.

Don't give me extras, don't give me great audio and video quality, don't give me great packaging, but do give me ""complete uncut original length"" episodes!!

The edited episodes are...
""Busy Wife""
""Kiddy Park""
""Stable for Three""
""Ed the Lover""
""The Pageant Show""
""The Aunt""
""Little Boy""
""The Contest""

Season one episodes should run about 25:30 in length or longer including opening and closing credits and Filmways tag.

I'm giving this a two instead of a one because everything else is nicely done.
Quality is good, and audio commentary track during first episode with Alan Young and Connie Hines is wonderful. (Sad to hear she recently passed December 18)

I understand, and hopefully it's true, that Season Two has no such issues with cut versions of episodes!!.......
""the second season set of Mister Ed will be the complete version of each episode, as originally broadcast.""",1262044800,79,1822,5.026578073089701
3890283,4,B002AMVEHY,"I loved watching Mr. ED on Nick at Nite in the late 80's and early 90's when I was a kid. Now after the Best OF sets we get the First Season of the show and its Great! It still holds up as did in the 60's and when i first saw it in the late 80's. Great show and great cast! If you like sticoms, you should add Mister ED to your collection!!!",1259539200,,341,3.6216216216216215
3890284,5,B002AMVEHY,"And so begins the classic TV Show from the Golden Days of Television which has finally made it to The Complete Season One on DVD. The wise cracking horse Mister Ed is here with his sidekick Wilber and his cute blond wife Carol. Also along for the wonderful comedic ride are the Post's trusty neighbors, Roger and Kay Addison, who are wonderful in their roles as well. ( The show really lost some charm in later seasons as the Colonel took over as Wilber's next door neighbor.)

All the classic season one episodes are here and appear to be nicely re-mastered with excellent sound and picture quality. All of the episodes are wonderful and some like ""Ed the Witness"" and ""Ed's Mother"" really shine in the series.

A must see DVD set for any fan of classic TV comedies with the incomparable Mister Ed as an unforgettable talking horse.",1259020800,,833,4.583892617449664

3890286,5,B002AMVEHY,"great sound and picture quality, this is real laugh a minute stuff. comedy is a great way to unwind and absolutly vital in these stressful times. if the antics of Wilbur and his newly aquired horse friend Mr. Ed don't get you laughing out loud then nothing will.",1256774400,,262,4.479166666666667
3890287,4,B002AMVEHY,"I AM SO GLAD TO SEE THIS UNIQUE BUT VERY FAMILY ORIENTED  SHOW, THE 60'S WERE A GREAT TIME OF ORIGINALITY BACK THEN , ME I NEVER WAS AROUND WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY AIRED, BUT ALOT OF FUN,  I THOUGHT ALAN YOUNG WAS PERFECT AS WILBUR, HE SEEMED LIKE A VERY KIND MAN, AND HIS WIFE ,CONNIE HINES  WHOM I THOUGHT WAS VERRRY BEAUTIFUL. ENJOY, I JUST PICKED  MY COPY OF SEASON ONE  AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING IT. ENJOY!!!!!",1256428800,,417,4.1625
3890288,3,B002AMVEHY,"I was disappointed to read a couple other reviews and find out that 8 EPISODES are probably syndicated EDITED versions in Mr. Ed Complete first season. Is this true? If so, WHY, WHY, WHY? Plus the price is $[...] for 26 half hour episodes. That's more than i want to spend on a half hour show with 8 episodes probably being edited on top of that. If 8 episodes are cut, then you CAN NOT truly call this a COMPLETE SEASON ONE SET. You see COMPLETE means the episodes are on there the way they origially aired which includes the music too. Also to find out that the discs 1 thru 3 each have 8 episodes and disc 4 has only 2 episodes makes absolutely no sense. I think there is still plenty of space available to have COMPLETE episodes.

There are some good things to point out about this set.
FIRST, four discs are put in two slim cases which comes in a slip box on the outside (I think that's the best way to package DVD sets). Hey it saves on shelf space too.
SECOND, there are still 18 episodes that are UNCUT in which 4 of them we're already released on the Best of Mr. Ed Vol. 1 set.
THIRD, there is commentary on the very first episode by Alan Young and Connie Hines (the show's stars who played Wilbur and Carol Post) and a documentary which includes interviews with Young & Hines.
FOURTH, the picture quality should look pretty good since it looked good in both of the Mr. Ed best of sets.

Now for half hours show I'd be willing to pay about $1.00 an episode. There are 26 episodes which means $26.00. BUT if there 8 cut episodes, then I would minus $8.00 (CUZ I'M NOT PAYING FOR EDITED CRAP) dropping the total amount that I'm willing to pay down to $18.00 for the 18 UNCUT episodes. Maybe I'm willing to pay $20.00 because of the bonus features.",1255910400,10,1754,4.248502994011976
8359885,4,B002AMVEHY,"For some reason, when watching Nick@Nite and TVLand in the 90s, MISTER ED was one show I always avoided because I assumed it would be too silly and nonsensical. I just finished the entire first season, and now I know why this show has been a Classic TV staple for years. I enjoyed it immensely and find it much more fun than something like MY THREE SONS, which I watched regularly, but now pales terribly in terms of originality and entertainment value.

Alan Young is charming as Wilbur Post and the pixie-ish Connie Hines is like a sixties version of Julia Duffy. The neighbors (Larry Keating, Edna Skinner) are a hoot! In fact, for me the best part of the show are the interactions between the human characters. They are all so likeable and fun, and the sets and fashions are a nostalgic look back into the classy Kennedy era of the early 60s. IMO the best episodes of the season were THE OTHER WOMAN, A MAN FOR VELMA, THE MISSING STATUE and THE MOUSTACHE. The only substandard episode is PINE LAKE LODGE, which was a (failed) backdoor pilot starring William Bendix, and so the Ed cast have very little to do with it, which makes it pretty dull.

Theres a Bonus interview with Alan and Connie (but for some reason the producers mis-spell Wilburs name repeatedly on-screen) that reveals some behind-the-scenes tidbits. The Menus are kind of annoying on this release because it takes a lot of work to locate a particular episode, so I am removing one star for that. The transfers themselves do look terrific though. I watched this season as part of the Complete Series box set. Avoid the stand-alone release of Season One because Shout Factory used edited episodes when they put it out in 2009.

A true TV Classic, Mister Ed is still a charmer nearly 60 years later.",1516233600,,1767,4.603174603174603
