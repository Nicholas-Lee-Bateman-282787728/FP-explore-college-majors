8277463,4,B001AHM3CK,"One of the most evil men who ever lived (Joseph Stalin could also vie for that dubious distinction) deserved to die! His own officers turned against him, and on July 20, 1944, they made a serious (and almost successful) attempt to kill Adolph Hitler with a bomb. Could the attempt have been successful, and how did events conspire to thwart the Stauffenberg plot?  How would history have been different had Hitler died nine months early? This DVD attempts to answer those questions by reconstructing Hitler's briefing room.",1359590400,,523,5.011494252873563
8277464,4,B001AHM3CK,"I bought this DVD for the ""Killing Hitler"" episode to show to my high school history classes. Experts re-enact the Operation Valkyrie plot where General Claus von Stauffenberg, a German war hero, attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler by putting a bomb in a briefcase and leaving it under a table where Hitler was about to conduct a meeting with other officers at his Wolf's Lair. We all know that this plot was unsuccessful and Hitler survived the bomb blast. I don't want to go into too much detail, but this episode goes into a couple of ""what if"" scenarios--what if the briefcase had not been moved? What if von Stauffenberg had not been interrupted and had put two bombs in the briefcase instead of one? History would possibly have been different because perhaps the war in Europe would have ended much sooner. This is speculation, of course, but it's interesting to have students speculate how things would have been different if Operation Valkyrie had actually worked. My students enjoyed watching the men blow up the fake Wolf's Lair and of course, World War II and Adolf Hitler are always popular among high school students. They enjoyed this DVD and most episodes of Unsolved History I've shown them.",1343347200,,1209,4.845410628019324
