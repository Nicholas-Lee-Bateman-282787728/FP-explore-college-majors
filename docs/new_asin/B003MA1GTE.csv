4155342,4,B003MA1GTE,"These three DVDs are great tools for teaching kids their alphabet, numbers and some phonics concepts. My oldest was a reluctant reader but these DVDs made it fun for him. My next child watched these at 3 years old and was reading on a second grade level by 5 years. My third child was just not interested in letters so I ordered this again (we had borrowed it for the first two) and now, at 4 years old and after only a month of watching these a couple times a week, she is sounding out simple words. I won't wait so long to show it to the rest of our kids.
The math circus is good, but not as wonderful as the letter and word factories. I like the fact that the DVDs are in a separate sleeve so the kids can play with the tin. Plus, the tin came in a nice plastic wrapped box so it was easy to gift wrap.",1326672000,,805,3.9447852760736195
4155343,5,B003MA1GTE,The Letter Factory is good. The rhythm is catchy and the show is interesting. My two years old will sing along though he does not recognize all the letters.,1310688000,,156,4.413793103448276
4155344,5,B003MA1GTE,"My 2.5 yo loves the tin packaging as much as the DVDs. The set also comes with a coloring book and crayons. As for the DVDs, Letter and Word Factory gets an A+. Math Circus gets a C. Given the price of the set, I'm O.K. with calling the Math Circus a freebie.",1308096000,,259,3.9056603773584904
4155345,5,B003MA1GTE,We are huge fans of the Leapfrog products.  They are educational and keep the kids interested.  Our son was challenged with learning his letters and sounds.  After watching The Letter Factory 2-3 times he really got it! I would recommend this to others.,1294099200,,253,4.837209302325581
8400317,5,B003MA1GTE,My grandchildren have loved this.  The 2 year old is learning words. He always asks for this when he comes over.,1402358400,,112,4.333333333333333
8400318,5,B003MA1GTE,These DVDs live up to the Leap Frog reputation & quality of experience.  They entertain & teach both grandsons - ages 4 & 20 months.,1374019200,,132,4.28
8400319,5,B003MA1GTE,The letter factory was awesome in less than a week my child recognized all her letters and knew their sound. The math DVD was a little to advance for her just turning 4. She loved talking word as well.,1371427200,,201,4.17948717948718
8400320,5,B003MA1GTE,I love these for my kids- I like this original classic series of leap frog movies with the original characters- I don't really like the new characters.,1365638400,,151,4.62962962962963
8400321,5,B003MA1GTE,"I purchased this item for my 3 month old nephew.  I used these dvd's for my son. My son is seven now, however he learned the alphabet sounds when he was 16 months old.",1364774400,,167,3.911764705882353
8400322,5,B003MA1GTE,"I love The Letter Factory--it is what helped my two kids learn the phonics. The Math Circus and the Talking Words Factory are an added plus and I'm sure my kids will love them when the time comes, but right now they are still very much enjoying the Letter Factory and it is the one they most ask to watch. The reason it works is because every one of the letters has its own way of being presented that helps the kids remember the sound. For example: the letter K is a Karate instructor and all the Ks pick up their legs and kick while making the ""K"" sound. Then you also have the letter T which is a Tap Dancer, the letter R which is a race car making the ""R"" sound with its engine, etc. The catchy song at the end of each little story also helps: ""The K says [k], the K says [k], every letter makes a sound, the K says [k]."" I strongly recommend this video to anyone looking to help their kids learn the phonics!",1358121600,,913,4.0497237569060776
8400323,5,B003MA1GTE,"LOVE these videos. The kids actually like them. They have learned a lot, and i when find myself singing about quidjits in the shower.",1354147200,,133,4.583333333333333
8400324,5,B003MA1GTE,"These videos are great, within watching these the next day my 5yr old was trying to read everything, sounding it out and really excited to learn.",1352764800,,145,4.615384615384615
8400325,5,B003MA1GTE,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who's 3 year old son is already spelling four-letter words on his own.  My daughter loves the Letter Factory video and is already learning all the sounds.  I can't wait to start her on the Word Factory to open up the world of reading to her.  This is a really great, low-pressure way to get your little one started.",1351382400,,363,4.3088235294117645
8400326,5,B003MA1GTE,My son was barely 2yrs old when we got this dvd for him. In two weeks he could recognize his alphabets and make all their sounds. He even began to show us alphabets all around the house. Its a must have for kids,1346630400,,211,3.9302325581395348
