2356012,5,B000A3BYCA,"I have auditioned a lot of dance videos.  But I OWN several of the Trautmans' videos.  Why?  Because the explanations are clear and the moves look so cool!

The videos are like real dance lessons.  Instead of two minute segments, each lesson is up to twenty minutes long and builds like a private session at the studio.  No more hitting rewind over and over as you practice - just follow along in real time.

The Trautmans break every move into simple parts and consolidate what they teach with repetition.  Leads and follows are clearly demonstrated.

And the moves are real choreographed routined, combinations that look smooth and sophisticated together, rather than a collection of tricks.  Learning those transitions is the difference between looking mechanical and gliding like a pro.",1164412800,24,790,5.054263565891473
2356013,5,B000A3BYCA,"My Husband and I both have two left feet and we never go dancing in public. After watching Shawn's video at home, we now surprise ourselves and our friends when we go out. It is so easy and fun to learn all of the steps. My husband and I always have a great time practicing old steps and learning new ones. We both highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn how to dance and learn hot new steps.",1142812800,39,409,4.061728395061729
2356014,5,B000A3BYCA,I really liked this video.  He showed each step individually from each point of view.  1. for the leader 2. for the follower 3. both together.  He showed the leader how to lead and the follower how to follow.  The only thing that I think he could have done better is to do the steps to music at the end of each section.,1138838400,27,319,4.015873015873016
2356015,5,B000A3BYCA,I am shocked! I have to admit I didn't think I'd really learn anything from this DVD. After all I had tried several other companies DVD's and still couldn't dance. But I thought I'd try one more. Thank you Shawn! I'm dancing! Very easy to understand. If Shawn can teach me to dance... he can dang sure teach you!,1127692800,28,312,4.305084745762712

2356017,5,B000A3BYCA,Well thought out and prepared lessons.  The video is very easy and pleasant to watch.  They really take a person from the VERY basics and walk you through in an attentive manner.  Its almost like you're in the room with them.  Clearly theyve taught group lessons before.,1467849600,5,270,4.680851063829787

2356024,5,B000A3BYCA,"Really for beginners, which I am. Shawn is a good teacher.
I wanted to update my review, since I have been working with the video more lately. I've been a teacher for 27 years, and I have to say that Shawn Trautman is an excellent teacher. He breaks everything down and gives you little sayings and ways to remember important components. Many videos I've looked at are put together by people who are great dancers, but not good teachers. Not so with this video. My husband is struggling a bit, but I'm learning fast. Just now ordering Slow Dancing for beginners, and from the description, I think this would have been a better place for us to start.",1423180800,9,649,4.508474576271187

2356028,5,B000A3BYCA,"OUR FAV! We have 7 of Shawn Trautman's DVD's and the two step is our FAV! We knew the two step but started with the Beginner DVD (highly recommended even if you know it). We learned our lesson with the Swing Dancing Intermediate. We thought we knew swing and ordered the intermediate. We found out that sadly (LOL) we did not know the Western Swing at all. So we backed up alittle and started with the ""beginner"" Two Step, even though we knew it. We still learned ALOT of valuable basics. Our frame was alittle weak, and sometimes our quick quick and slow slow blended into ""quicklow"" thats a quick slow that lacks definition.  I still love the basic turns vines, wraps, turns. I get bored if I'm not turning or changing the two step up. My hubby is great, if he starts to ""slack off"" I just say ""can you change it up alittle?"" and Yes he can now. Thanks Shawn and Joanna! PS. This is great ""couple  time"". Just be careful to be politically correct when trying to help each other. I admit that the guys have most of the work to do.
Happy to follow. Love my hubby dance time!",1405555200,2,1074,4.285714285714286
2356029,4,B000A3BYCA,"Very thorough and easy to understand.  The quality of the video wasn't all that great, but it serves its purpose.",1355702400,3,113,4.65
2356030,4,B000A3BYCA,"This video is a good beginners lesson, but is not for anyone who already has some dance experience.  It is extremely slow moving and each step is repeated over and over.",1353456000,4,169,4.451612903225806
2356031,4,B000A3BYCA,"After many years sitting on the side lines watching I decided to try Shawn Trautman's dance instruction video .My wife is a great dancer but I'm a terrible dancer .We tried dance lesson after watching Bristol Palin on Dancing with the stars. Things were going good until they changed my wife's work hours at the hospital. MY wife is my high school girlfriend but we just recently married 35 years later.
 So we were both pleasantly surprised when we received Shawn's video in the mail .After viewing and dancing a long it was so easy. Great instructions clear video easy to follow great sound quality they have split screen to show the foot steps at the same time. Now were ready for more lesson from Shawn vast collection .Can't wait to try more of Shawn's video and to take my sweetheart dancing again .",1349654400,5,805,4.590277777777778
2356032,5,B000A3BYCA,"If you like country music and need to learn how to dance the country 2-step, you need to check out Shawn Trautman's Dance Collection for easy-to-learn instruction.  I have over 20 of his DVDs and learning new steps every day.  Dancing is fun!  You will be the envy of everyone on the dance floor, men and women.  You need to get with it!",1314144000,3,337,4.301587301587301
2356033,4,B000A3BYCA,"I ordered this DVD after reading the glowing reviews. I like it a lot, but I have two fairly minor complaints: 1. His instruction pace is verrrryyyyy ssssslllloooowww and 2. The video quality is not that great.

Regarding the instruction pace, if you like things spelled out very, very thoroughly, you will love it. If you're a bit more fast-paced, you'll get a little impatient.

Regarding the video quality: it's not terrible, but it's certainly not up to today's standards for DVD. It looks like VHS video quality.

So, I still like the DVD, glad I ordered it, but everyone was *gushing* so much that I wanted to provide just a little bit of a counterpoint, as a reality check.",1258156800,21,680,4.65
2356034,3,B000A3BYCA,Not sure I picked out the right CD. I wanted a very basic dance I could learn with my husband but not sure he will think this is too easy.,1256169600,2,138,3.6333333333333333
2356036,5,B000A3BYCA,We find this the best instuctional video we have.  Shaun teaches in a way that you can follow without being confused by too much too fast as many other insructors do. We found it easy to follow and with great tips on style.,1245369600,2,223,4.186046511627907
2356037,5,B000A3BYCA,"From the wild wild west of Wyoming. This is an easy to learn 2 Step DVD. Once you get this one, you will be hooked. You might as well get the 2 step 3 pack and save some money. My husband and I are pretty good two steppers and started with the advanced 2 step DVD, then ordered the beginner to see what we missed. I think it is great for beginners or advanced. **Stand the way they tell you too** girls mimic Joanne and guys mimic Shawn. I try to keep my eye on Joanne's feet, dance awhile and check to see that I'm still in step with her. That makes it very easy to follow. We polished up our 2 step skills with the beginner and then went on to the advanced DVD.",1229299200,4,663,3.9185185185185185
2356038,5,B000A3BYCA,I have watched several videos on learning the two-step.  Almost all of them focus on the foot work and completely leave out the signals to your partner.  This video covers that important topic.,1227830400,3,193,4.818181818181818
2356039,5,B000A3BYCA,Shawn's tapes are terrific.  I also have two of his line dancing CD's.  It's like having your own private teacher in your home showing you the steps.  I've been taking a dance class and I've truly learned as much from Shawn as I have from the dance class.  Simple & easy to learn.,1207958400,8,280,4.226415094339623
2356040,5,B000A3BYCA,"This DVD is fantastic it starts with the basics and gets you started doing the two-step.  They cover the material in a nice concise manner, showing it from different viewpoints.  It is definitely for beginners, but if you are just starting with the two-step, it is the way to go.",1183852800,6,279,4.56

2356042,5,B000A3BYCA,"If you have two left feet and  have a difficult time remembering instructions, especially when it comes to dance lessons, then believe me, this dance video is for you.  Trust me, Shawn and his wife make the lessons so unbelievably easy that I'm now slightly embarrassed when I realize how easy it is to two-step.  I always got mixed up on the dance floor and wasn't really sure I was two-stepping correctly, but now I know exactly how to do it!  I am going to order more of his videos.",1173312000,23,485,4.355555555555555
2356043,5,B000A3BYCA,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,9,1017,4.585635359116022
2356044,5,B000A3BYCA,"I had spent hundreds and hundreds on learn to dance videos before I finally starting receiving Shawn Trautman's videos.  I then realized all that early money was wasted.  Shawn's tapes is the best there is.

I now have received his Two-Step for beginners Volume One and Two and his Intermediate Two-Step Video.

The Beginner Tape Volume One starts out slow just for the person who has never danced before and then progresses on so even if you have some dancing experience you can still learn from this tape.

Beginner Tape Volume Two picks up from there and progresses at a speed that anyone can learn.

The Two Step Intermediate tape takes over then and progresses slowly into a more advanced level.

I recommend these tapes to anyone because the teaching method used by Shawn's tapes are done in a way that are easy to understand and makes it easy for any beginner to understand but at the same time someone who already has experience can learn from the tapes also.  The tapes are done so well that I feel if a beginner looked at one of Shawn's more advanced tapes they could even learn from that..

Hopefully this review will help someone not waste hundreds of dollars like I did buying bad tapes. I wish I would have had this information and I would have bought Shawn's tapes first and I would have not wasted all that money on bad tapes.",1164499200,22,1342,4.535269709543568
2356045,5,B000A3BYCA,"This is the one that'll get you out there. If you know two-step, you can dance to pretty much anything. The two-step is broken up into 3 dvds so each one is very thorough. This is the first one, but it takes you pretty far. There is alot of detailfor just a ""beginner's video"". It will definitely get you out there and dancing and then some!",1164499200,13,341,4.181818181818182

Trautman's DVD has proven very worthwhile in helping me get back up to a reasonable competency level.
