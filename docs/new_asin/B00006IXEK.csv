1781256,1,B00006IXEK,I don't understand the good reviews.  This movie was terrible.  Half way through I didn't know what was going on.  The characters were weak and the plot was weaker.,1036713600,2,164,4.586206896551724
1781257,5,B00006IXEK,"I have finally checked out ""Formula 51"" at the theater a couple of days ago, and while watching the film, I instantly found out that it had a very silly side to the whole thing, but the plot was very entertaining nonetheless, and I loved the rest of the film automatically! In fact, ""Formula 51"" was so hilarious that I would have to see it again in a heartbeat! The direction of Ronny Yu (""Warriors of Virtue"", ""Bride of Chucky"") was outstanding! And as far as the performances go, most of the credit goes to Academy Award winner Samuel L. Jackson (""Changing Lanes"", ""Shaft""), Robert Carlyle (007: ""The World is Not Enough"", ""The Full Monty""), and the lovely Emily Mortimer (""Disney's The Kid"", ""Scream 3"") for their hilarious performances! ""Formula 51"" first takes place back in 1971, and Elmo McElroy (Jackson), who's wearing late 60's clothes at the time, is just like any other college graduate, until he is pulled over by a California state trooper for having marijuana inside his car. Now, fast forward to the present day, the year 2002. Elmo is now an illegal drug chemist who has just made a breakthrough with a new recreational drug that he created in which he calls it ""P.O.S. 51"". And during the film, Elmo travels to Liverpool, England in hopes of finding a market for his new product. Along the way, Elmo crosses paths with a beautiful and elusive hired gun named Dakota Parker (Mortimer), in which she is hired by a manipulative fence called ""The Lizard"" (Meat Loaf) to follow Elmo to England in order to retrieve the formula from Elmo, etc. While in England, Elmo meets up with a soccer-loving, Yank-hating hitman named Felix DeSousa (Carlyle). And action and mayhem begins as Elmo and Felix are being chased down by the bad guys and Dakota, who just so happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend. From then on, Dakota also reluctantly teams up with Elmo and Felix in order to help Elmo reach his ultimate goal: to bring his new drug to the British rave scene...and also to get paid as well! To me, the ironic thing about this film is that to everyone's surprise, Sam Jackson's character wears a Scottish kilt throughout the entire film! In conclusion, I just have to say that ""Formula 51"" is among one of the absolute funniest action-comedies that I've seen since the ""Rush Hour"" films, or any other action-comedy for that matter. ""Formula 51"" also has three great performances from a talented and top-notch cast, a great supporting cast (Meat Loaf, Sean Pertwee, Rhys Ifans), and a great soundtrack as well! A great film for any action-comedy fan or any Samuel L. Jackson fan. I can't wait for the DVD of ""Formula 51"" to be released!",1035244800,3,2644,4.700431034482759
1781258,5,B00006IXEK,"I have a few hard-and-fast movie viewing rules, and one that's NEVER let me down is this: Any movie with Samuel L. Jackson is worth seeing. Formula 51 is no exception.
  Mr. Jackson (The coolest cat in movies today) plays Elmo McElroy, a Pharmacological genius who has been trapped in a state of indentured servitude for 30 years, toiling away making designer drugs for sleazebag drug-kingpin The Lizard (Played by the extra-crispy Meat Loaf). He's created a perfectly legal drug, (Made from ordinary household objects) which he calls POS-51, supposedly 51 times more potent than Heroin and Cocaine. After breaking loose from The Lizard, Elmo makes his way to Liverpool to sell the formula on his own, and finally start living the good life. Unfortunately, The Lizard has sent assassin Dawn/Dakota (The adorable Emily Mortimer) after him; First to kill him, later to keep him safe until he can coerce him into giving up the formula. THEN kill him....
  The film plays like a hybrid of Quentin Tarentino, Monty Python, and Hong Kong action flicks, with a distinctly British flavor injected into it by actors Ricky Tomlinson, Robert Carlysle, and Rhys Ifans, all of whom are excellent. Director Ronny Yu is comfortable mixing genres, as shown by the fast-paced action scenes and the laugh-out-loud comedy. I'll never forget the scene in the lab with the skinheads.....Jackson, is, of course, excellent. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a LONG time; Can't wait for the DVD!",1034985600,7,1482,4.963709677419355
1781259,5,B00006IXEK,"...It is a mixture of Pulp Fiction (and of the first Tarentino script, can't remember its name, True  Romance??) and Monthy Python non-sense, with a flavor of very dark humor (dead people all over the place). Samuel L. in kilt, is for a french guy, a hell of an idea. The view of England through american eyes is also very funny. On the top of that Samuel plays a genius pharmacological chemist that looks real...Enjoyable, really.",1020902400,6,431,4.671052631578948
1781260,5,B00006IXEK,"Jackson plays himself but gets the freedom he needs. If you ever want to know what a real american is like in England then this film is for you, Plenty of comical momments and a pretty decent plot, written by a guy who owned a fish & chip shop I believe. Has a bad ending but this doesnt let it down.",1018224000,6,300,3.9344262295081966
1781261,4,B00006IXEK,"Now this is something of a rarity, a British action comedy that actually delivers and is as good, if not better, than many of the so-called action comedies Hollywood occasionally delivers. It of course stars an American, the king of cool himself Samuel L Jackson, it's also part-financed by American money and it is directed by Ronny Yu but it's still essentially a British movie, written by Stel Pavlou (not a very British name, I know) whilst working in liquor store.
Master chemist Elmo McElroy (Samuel L Jackson) has apparently invented the recreational drug to end all recreational drugs but the trouble is he's in debt to a nasty villain known as The Lizard (Meat Loaf). So he flees the country, with The Lizard's ruthless hit-woman Dakota Phillips on his tail, to sell the formula to British gangster Leopold Durant (Ricky Tomlinson) in a multi million dollar deal. Arriving in Liverpool he is met by the American hating, soccer loving Felix DeSouza (Robert Carlyle), and they are forced into a partnership of convenience. Cue many cross-cultural misunderstandings and laughs as DeSouza, mocks Jackson's kilt wearing character; ""fag?"" he enquires when offering him a cigarette. ""So let me get this straight. `Bollocks is bad whereas dogs bollocks is good, right?"" enquires Jackson.
 Undoubtedly influenced by Quentin Tarantino, The 51st State takes a quintessentially American movie genre and gives it a British spin. It sets kilt wearing black American as a fish out of water in Liverpool, a place where the people are strange and the language is even stranger. But is he fazed by any of this? No, of course not. Not one iota, as he struts about in his kilt carrying his golf clubs and occasionally wielding them to dispatch the numerous bad guys. Jackson and Carlyle are both of course excellent and they are ably supported by Emily Mortimer and Rhys Ifans, in his first decent role since `Notting Hill'. Ronny Yu gives the movie a good snappy pace and the script is full of good comic and action set-pieces as well as one liners. It does have its flaws though. In particular `The Lizard' played by Meat Loaf is a pretty weak villain, there is not enough of Ricky Tomlinson as the haemorrhoid troubled Leopold Durant and there was too much profanity for my liking. Overall though this made for a good night out at the movies and I'd definitely recommend it.",1013385600,15,2366,4.856435643564357
1781262,5,B00006IXEK,"This movie is totally, absolutely off the wall. Nuts in the extreme. It's an American style genre, the action comedy, but with a British twist. Samuel L Jackson is hysterical and the movie is so tongue in cheek it's almost a tongue in somebody else's cheek. VERY VERY FUNNY. You have to see it just for the uhm, bodily function scene and the explosion at the end. That's all I'll say about that. SEE IT!!!",1012780800,4,405,4.413333333333333

1781285,4,B00006IXEK,"""Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Carlyle lead off in this crime caper set in, of all things, Liverpool. The film's execution and premise is typical buddy-cop formula and crime thriller yet the film has so much cross-continental humour and out-of-deck randomness in it, the experience viewing it for the first time was hilarious and unusual at the same time. The film makes more of an effort to be a silly, farcical adventure that supposedly has a drug-dealing plot towards it and action moments, but this is moreover a comedy that works in being very funny, loud, and often bizarre but not well at plotting devices, consistency, pacing, and editing. When you see toward the end of this film, you will feel you have not learned much here aside from how Jackson seems to be wearing a kilt. If you like Snatch, you might like this. If you like Hot Fuzz, Lethal Weapon, or Rush Hour, you might like this but may find the story to be a bit too simple and uneven.""",1362873600,,955,4.558139534883721

1781288,4,B00006IXEK,"A very highly underrated movie that didn't get anywhere near the box office $$$ it should have. Love watching this with Lock, Stock & 2 smoking Barrels or Snatch, Hysterical British humor and Samuel L at his best. Meatloaf is a funny addition as well.",1354492800,,251,4.6
1781289,2,B00006IXEK,"Bearing a wealth of guns, drugs, quirky characters and fiery chase scenes, this desperately wants to be a cool, slick, suave black comedy in the same vein as Pulp Fiction or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. With none of the panache, authenticity, or cornerstone performances that made its forefathers into modern classics, though, it comes off as a weak, uncertain impersonation instead. The plot plays it loose and loopy, with characters losing sight of their own motivations between set changes, and becomes especially doublecross-happy as the credits near. Samuel L. Jackson plays the only part of note, as nothing more than his standard blue-lipped hardass, while Emily Mortimer is thoroughly unconvincing as a cold-blooded killer and Meat Loaf occupies the bizarre role of a drug-dealing Macguffin who constantly speaks in the third-person. Forgettable, shallow and bland.",1344988800,,881,5.437956204379562
1781290,3,B00006IXEK,"Yeah, it's tough to buy Samuel Jackson as a world-class PhD biochemist.  His vocabulary is very street, jive, non-college educated.  If you watch enough Samuel Jackson films, you quickly get the idea that he writes his own dialog to fit his actual persona -- it doesn't matter who his character is, or level of education -- he's either jive, or predictable (e.g. the film ""Basic"" -- he's done that character in several films too).

But, the plot of the film is that he invented a drug that will get all the kids high without bad side effects, and is super cheap to produce.  It quickly becomes an interesting action film with a deadly hit woman, who alternates between trying to kill her ex-boyfriend and trying to reconcile with him.

Lots of shootouts and blood and explosions.

And a surprise ending.",1330128000,,803,4.7

1781292,5,B00006IXEK,"If you're a Pulp Fiction fan, then this movie will feel just like a continuation of that movie, especially since Samuel Jackson was a main character in both movies. And you probably have to love drugs and be interested in watching the process of drugs being made, transported, and sold in night clubs. This whole movie is basically one long drug deal that takes forever to finally complete, which is fine by me. I only wish the movie spent more time showing him having success in selling his new drug and living the high life. This is one of the only drug dealer movies I've ever seen that have a happy ending, where he succeeds in getting his money and starting a new life as a millionaire.

Being an amateur chemist myself (alchemist) who has been successful in manufacturing the real ""Elixir of Life"" that cures all disease and reverses the again process, I especially like the beginning of this movie, because it showed him making his large batch of drugs in a professional lab with a pill making machine producing hundreds of thousands of pills at once. I wish there was more of the chemistry scenes later in the movie, but even when he makes the drugs again after he gets to London, they don't show the process in any great detail.

Sort of a movie that makes you wish there was more to the movie, and you want it to last just a little longer, or maybe have similar movies made like it. I personally think there just aren't enough good drug dealer movies. ;-)",1288396800,,1465,4.48314606741573

It has a nice story twist at the end, great acting, good action, unusual dark comedy, and much more. I can't usually sit through two hours of just bloody gang movies, but I can if they have some great comedy. This one definitely has a funny comedy touch with a good ending. The irony is when a pharmacist (Samual Jackson) is busted for smoking marijuana right after he graduates college and it ruins his chance to go legitimate. Left to his limited remaining choices he takes the pharmaceutical version of illegal drugs to a new level. A must see for people that enjoy the movies I mentioned before.

1781296,3,B00006IXEK,"This film does take a lot from Guy Ritchie's style, but it's not exactly the same. It also reminds me of ""True Romance"". I think this movie also goes a little bit more towards ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". The basic story is the staging of a drugdeal for the formula of a superdrug. This keeps going wrong due to all the schemes the main characters are involved in. I found this an amusing film. Don't expect anything truly original, but there certainly are memorable performances and characters. If you like something that's a bit off the wall with a lot of action go see his.

1781298,3,B00006IXEK,"This film suffers from the millennial Brit-cool factor that began a slow creep into American consciousness in the 90s and had morphed into a full-blown genre by the year 2000. Had Formula 51 (2001) been dreamed up a few years earlier it might have experienced a better reception. But it comes slightly too late in the game to succeed entirely -- the afterglow of Lock, Stock... (1998) is gone and the promise of Guy Ritchie has already begun to wane. Coming as it does on the tail end of things, it feels like we've seen most of it before.

The quirky blend of star power is also not quite enough to take Formula 51 safely out of the hazard zone -- if anything it contributes to the stumble. Between them, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Carlyle helped shape the genre in which Formula 51 is operating. Jackon, via association with Tarantino and several of his other high-profile roles in the 90s, carved out the definition of thinking hard assitude (there is usually something going on in the heads of Jackson's characters -- underneath the attitude, he's a scientist, he's a reader, he's a doctor, he's a pharmacologist, etc.). And Carlyle popped up in many of the films that registered the new Britain within the American consciousness -- ex. the young people herded to see Trainspotting, their parents flocked to see the Full Monty.

The combination of these two stars must have seemed brilliant in the boardroom, and even to the stars themselves. And they do work well together. The problem is that Jackson is too one-dimensional to be the focus, and Carlyle -- usually a force to be reckoned with whether he's doing action, comedy or drama -- comes off as weak against the sheer wattage of Jackson's attitude.

Jackson, paying for a mistake made on the side of a California highway 30 years before, wants out of the drug trade... but we never really see why. Sure, his boss is a jerk, but we don't see them together and witness their dynamic until the end of the film. Jackson tries to blow the guy up at the beginning -- this is supposed to be enough to tell us that he has spent 30 years toiling in the drug trade under oppressive psychotic boss types and now he wants out. But it isn't. If anything, it looks like Jackson has always been in charge and enjoying himself. This is what I mean by one dimensional -- he seems to be in one mode: hard ass (without much motivation).

Meanwhile, Carlyle is properly ballsy and crazy, though bumbling, with his own crew, but once Jackson arrives in Liverpool he can't hold his own. He is meant to learn something from Jackson, but whether he does is never clear -- the filmmakers thought it was enough for him to get the girl in the end, rather than round out the character he tries to shape.

These two very capable actors find themselves with their usual roles reversed -- here Jackson is the leader, Carlyle the sidekick. In his supporting roles, Jackson usually leaves us wanting more of his badass smarts. If he's going to play the lead he's got to have a little more to work with (and work a little harder). And Carlyle is usually the one in charge, even when he's screwing it up -- to see him playing second fiddle just doesn't seem quite right. So this combination of two 90s major players becomes problematic... and contributes to the overall mess.

The rest of the cast is almost irrelevant -- Emily Mortimer, an actress who I love and who is consistently good and often underappreciated, clearly took the role for pure over-the-top fantasy reasons. She gets to sport two accents, wear different leather outfits (not to mention a blond wig), drive fast cars, scale buildings, shoot guns, etc. A fun adrenaline departure from her usual quiet fare. And she's fine in the role. But you never really get inside her character's head, and it seems a bit too neatly tied up for her to end up where she does in the end. It was hard to believe that she'd leave in the first place -- and where did a nice girl like this learn to hit, anyway? Someone with a bit more edge might have brought something more to the role... and someone with a bit more celebrity (like a rock star or athlete in a cameo) might have brought a bit more spark to bolster the film outside the theatre (ex. Vinnie Jones turns actor... that was conversation in itself). I love Emily Mortimer, but no one goes to the movies just to see her. Meanwhile, Rhys Ifans enjoys himself as an unhinged drug king (and it would be unfair not to mention Ifans's contribution to the Brit-cool consciousness factor via Notting Hill).Sean Pertwee is also fully capable as the copbut brings nothing new to his role and Meat Loaf (who has fared better in other films) is just plain awful as the Lizard.

At any rate, the film isn't horrible -- there are some truly funny moments (skinheads, chakras, football...) in between the flat expanses and far-fetched flights of action movie fancy. It's hardly the worst film in the world. It's just a bit uninspiring. And it can't meet the expectations placed upon it by its place within the timeline of pop culture... or survive beyond the confines of the Brit-cool genre (which seems to have either died completely or is in the process of evolving into something else). Also, if you have a hard time understanding anything but American English and honestly believe that London is the only city in England, then this film is not for you (note to Brits: not all Americans are such unfortunates, thanks).And I'm sorry but the final shot contains some of the worst body-part double work I've ever seen. The skin was a completely different color and you could actually see where they'd cut off the other guy at the waist. A bizarre misstep.

Meanwhile, I think a sequel of sorts (gasp) operating entirely outside the genre, in which Robert Carlyle andEmily Mortimer attempt to make an actual go of it, would be interesting. While we get to learn why she's into guns and where she learned (and whether she can keep that itch for the trigger under control), he'd doubtless be unable to stay out trouble in the pubs (or elsewhere)... Well, I'd watch it.",1121558400,3,6089,4.60036832412523

The humour and interaction between Samuel and Robert, the quick dialogue exchanges, and the introduction to the english football mentality to a poor unsuspecting american, makes for great tv! Any liverpudlians reading the above reference to the Thames will be seething mind, as thats about 200miles (and several cultures) to the south of liverpool. Certainly there is an air of Tarantino to the film though, and the story shifts from place to place enough to make a second viewing useful, just to make sure you caught it all! Thats not a negative though, as once you've watched it, you'll want to see it again anyway!

The language too is impressively realistic! That is to say, coarse, as you'd expect from drug dealing gun toting mad men, but also funny, again Tarantino-esk. Its escapism, and frankly, i loved it!",1100044800,,884,4.815789473684211
1781303,5,B00006IXEK,"I have this as ""The 51st State."" It would seem that the US release as Formula 51 must have been edited to result in a different movie as the European version is brilliant. Then again, being English I probably understand it better than most Americans (that sounds insulting; to clarify, being a native Brit means I'm more attuned to the accents, the slang and the geography). The kilt issue is explained at the end when Elmo claims his birthright as the descendant heir of a bloodline resulting from the rampant couplings of a Scottish plantation owner and his negro slave (back when that sort of thing was done). Altogether, a riotous gangster flick - Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels with more humour set in a city other than London. The irony here is that Carlyle, a Scot, plays a Scouser (slang for a person from Liverpool, England) whilst Jackson, an African-American, plays a nominal Scot (albeit with the usual SLJ vocal delivery instead of a more Celtic expressionism). For a Hollywood movie this captures the more offbeat aspects of British culture brilliantly (namely football - or soccer, if you prefer - our slang and our humour, among other things) and does it as well as British-made movies of a similar ilk, such as Lock, Stock..., Snatch, and Gangster No. 1.

If you don't get it first time, watch it again. And again. And again. Then visit England and try our lager (most of which is German or Danish) and our steak (which is certified 110% safe, unlike that from France). It's worth the effort (visiting England, not the movie!).

1781304,1,B00006IXEK,"Let me put it this way; the trailers for the movie were more exciting than the movie itself. Sam Jackson ripped off the entire world with this piece of crap. I cannot believe that he's that desperate for money, but it has become clear to me that he'll take ANY role, any time and place. He's the highest grossing star in Hollywood, but that's not because of the quality of his movies - it's because he accepts any script that comes his way and nickeled and dimed his way to the top of the heap. His limited range (mostly screams) is evidenced by his roles in ""Long Kiss Goodnight,""""Eve's Bayou,""""The Negotiator,""""New Jack City,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and the bit part in Goodfellas."" and many more. He's the same guy with a different hair piece.

I am not going to even attempt to explain how much of a story you can get about a chemist who people want to steal a formula from. The last time this was done was in ""Darkman,"" but even that movie had SOME redeeming qualities. Not so for ""Formula 51."" Any time you see a black man wearing a kilt and carrying a golf club, you know you're venturing into some strange territory.

With the exception of ""Evildead,"" ""D.C. Cab"" and the ""Ernest Goes to ..."" movies, this is the worst I've EVER seen. Don't rent it and surely don't buy it -- that is unless you've run out of kindling for the fireplace.",1093910400,4,1335,4.40080971659919

Sorry... back to reviewing here...

Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting being two ""classics"" in my opinion, this ""Formula 51"" (AKA ""The 51st State"") movie ripped off the basic premise of the two works of cinematic art, and smashed them untidily together in this POS 51 flick. POS representing whatever you want the 3 letters to stand for ;-)

Riddle me this - I still never got why ""Elmo"" wore a kilt!  I'll just ponder that one for a moment...OH - to distract you from the fact that the movie is uncreative, and because I imagine Sam L Jackson rather fancied wearing a kilt throughout an entire film - wouldn't you?  Still don't see the point of its mention however. I never should have reached for that popcorn at that moment they apparently told us.  [shrugs] oh well.

1781306,3,B00006IXEK,"A qiute good offbeat film that unfortunately misses the  mark.
For a start a large number of Americans will not get the irony of the film. Looking at the film in retrospect now, you have to be English to understand some of the humour . Also to our transatlantic cousins, there are other cities in The UK after London!
The superb Samuel L Jackson is playing a toned down caricuture of Samuel L Jackson for us tamer brits; ha ha.
However I do enjoy this film and seeing Jackson trading insults  with assorted British tv actors who ( lets be honest )are not going to set Hollywood alight. With the exeption of Robert Carlyle  plays a great comical/cynical sidekick who always delivers in his peformances.
It is also refreshing  having a British action film, not wussy period dramas or crappy romantic comedies starring the antichrist Hugh Grant!",1089072000,,842,4.707482993197279

Where this movie fails is in the complete lack of backup characters.  Meatloaf is terrible, but not nearly as bad as others that go unmentioned here.  The file has some great visual scenes, a good musical score, and decent dialogue.  The movie succeeds at balancing humor and action.

1781311,2,B00006IXEK,"""Formula 51"" was fitful to watch.  I blame the dreadful directing by Ronny Yu.  The opening sequence (after the pitiful pandering to 60s/70s drug culture in the prologue) has Samuel L. Jackson creating some kind of chemical we don't know about, with Meatloaf mad at him for something we don't know about, and Samuel L. Jackson trying to blow up Meatloaf because... well, we just don't know why... because Yu doesn't tell us.
The subpar directing continues to the end of the film when the reality of Samuel L. Jackson's ecstasy-style designer drug (the namesake for the title ""Formula 51"") is revealed.  The ending really cheapened the previous 90 minutes (if that was possible).
The redeeming quality of this film is Robert Carlyle (also seen in ""The Full Monty"").  Robert Carlyle is fantastic.  He is the only reason this movie is watchable.  He is frenetic and unpredictable.  It is classic Carlyle as he jumps between ""lightning in a bottle"" zaniness mixed with brief glimpses of sincere vulnerability.
What stands out memorably is a scene where Carlyle supports his Liverpool soccer/football team by entering a pub dominated by Manchester United fans, lighting a flare, and preceding to insult them and taunt them.  The thirty of them chase him around the pub.  It is pure physical comedy and a true fantasy for anyone who loves to hate the Manchester United club.
Samuel L. Jackson is the lead as Elmo McElroy.  True to his Scottish last name, he wears a kilt and brandishes golf clubs in fights.  He is fairly cool, but not as dominatingly cool as he is in Pulp Fiction.
Yes, there are some laugh-out-loud moments, but they are outnumbered by groan-out-loud moments.  Do not expect ""Snatch"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" with this one.  Ronny Yu is not in the same league as Guy Ritchie or Quentin Tarantino.",1067904000,5,1802,4.849673202614379

It seems to me when a movie has numerous interludes of a character standing still, staring at the camera whilst the latest punk/heavy metal/rap song is booming that time needs to be filled due to lack of story.  This flick was simply okay, I have to admit I turned it off at the one hour mark because it was kind of dumb.  Trying to be different and stylish doesn't make a movie cool, the coolest movies are different and stylish because they aren't trying to be.  If you like gritty TARENTINOesque films watch PULP FICTION again instead and be rewarded with a better SAM JACKSON performance and a movie thats light years ahead in coolness over this loud mess.",1060473600,3,795,4.462068965517242
1781314,5,B00006IXEK,"I took a chance with this film; I don't remember seeing many, if any at all, promotions for Formula 51 (though that of course means zilch) and I was surprised to see it at my favored theater at the time (which plays zero foreign films and this one, in my mind, should be under that category due to the strong British accents and slang, which are harder to discern than Japanese to me). Boy did it pay off. My mother and I (dont ask how I dragged her along) laughed from head-to-toe the entire film. And not those chuckles, grunts, and half-hearted laughs that are associated with cliched teen comedies (where you only half laugh because everyone else is and you don't want to seem as if you didn't get it, when of course you did but it just wasn't funny at all), but the true tear-producing, side splitting convulsions that mark the arrival of a classic comedy. Now, classic may be a poor word choice to describe the movie at this point for most (it will undoubtedly be decades before a significant number of people consider this one a classic), but for me this film brought instant gratification and love. Now for some reason some of those pencil pushing, half motivated, lost-sight-of-what-movies-are-all-about, self-proclaimed movie reviewers (save this beef for another day), didn't like Formula 51 (maybe its their lack of obsession over the United Kingdom), calling it Euro-trash or something on the lines of mindless, plot less, garbage. Well, I found it hil-ar-ious. Regardless of whether the plot was as engaging as The Matrixs, the film still entertained. And isn't that the goal of any movie; to entertain the audience, by any means necessary? Some movies do this by plot, or by character development, and some do it with flat out humor. Lets give the movie re-foolers the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just didn't find the bathroom-style humor funny. Well, maybe next time they should remove their paycheck from their arse and remember just what movies are about: Entertainment. And to me the plot didn't have many problems to begin with. I enjoyed the comedic spin on mob life and crooked cops, which Formula 51 implemented, as opposed to the more serious, melodramatic aura of The Godfather (always a classic though). Through all the shoot-outs, car chases, planning, swearing, swearing, swearing, and shooting, I was hoping so much for a plot twist; my prayers were answered. That all of these drug lords and mobsters and crooked men were after a drug, that they thought would be more powerful than ecstasy, cocaine, and heroine combined, that turned out to merely be a placebo, and the entire movie and action an elaborate endorsement setup, rang like music to my ears and did my heart well. Samuel L. Jackson nails his characters role down to the kilt and braids, as always (note to self:Samuel L. Jackson has played a lot of differing roles: Scientist, Jedi Knight, Black Panther-style Vigilante and Cop, and many more) and Robert Carlyle graces the screen, as Felix, with phenomenal emotion, wit, and unwavering humor and zest; hes become a favored actor of mine due to this film. Whether you liked it for its humor, action, and wit, or hated it for lack thereof, Formula 51 will always have POS over my mind: Power Of Suggestion.",1059868800,,3252,4.808928571428571
1781315,4,B00006IXEK,"Not bad. This ultra-violent and ultra-profane action comedy does provide quite a good dose of laughs, thrills and golf. I was shocked when this film was yanked from the local theaters after only one week of playing; so when I saw it on the shelf at the video store, I grabbed it as quickly as I could. I was quite pleased with the result. The film plays out much like a Guy Ritchie-Quentin Tarantino crime caper with the music and editing of a John Woo Hong Kong superaction film. Highly entertaining and much better than I ever expected. Although the witty dialogue helps beef up the shoddy plot lines, it's Jackson's presence that gives this film its credibility. Samuel L. Jackson is, and continues to be, one of the greatest actors in our generation...and its because he carries movies like this one.

Basically it is like extacsy but 51 times stronger supposidly. And he wants 20 million to sell the ingredents or formula. So you have all these (Quirky) drug Lords trying to catch & negotiate with him. And basically it isn't anything but a bunch of over the counter drugs mixed together. In the beginning he was arrested and that is why he is so bitter and trying to make up for the charade. Like I said this is just O.K nothing to run home and tell momma about! The best feature in this is the ""Hit Woman"" she was really attractive. Sam's part in ""Attack of the Clones"" was far more impressive than this.

This actually reminded me of a poor mans ""Snatch"" with more action.  Some of the camera angles and camera scenes brought ""Snatch"" to mind with a harder edge.  Loved it.  The only downfall, is Meatloaf as the Lizard.  I think John Malkovich would have played a much, much better villain (See Con Air, In the Line of Fire, Knockaround Guys) who was actually believable.  However, action is what keeps my attention and keeps me awake.  Besides, there were no real dull moments throughout the movie and it moved at a fast pace.",1048204800,,636,4.478260869565218

The plot relies on a very odd and offbeat offering of comedic and at times graphic violence. The plot is old and worn out but the movie however, invokes a few laughs. In many parts you will ask yourself, ""what the hell was that all about?"".

1781322,4,B00006IXEK,"This is a typical example of love-or-hate film.  I happened to love this one, so read this review as a message from such a fan.  But, I am afraind, some of the audiences, largely American professional critics, seem to be missing the point, or very British feature of the film, so let me have a word here.
The film is mainly set in Liverpool.  Samuel L. Jackson's character Elmo, arriving there from USA just now, is going to have a very big deal with the local gang (Ricky Tomlinson).  It's all about a formula, with which you can make a 100% legal drug of which effect is 51 times as enhanced as the usual stuff in the market.  Felix (Robert Carlyle) is appointed to meet Elmo at the airport and escort him to the boss's, but when a violent shoot-out begins, Felix, fiercely hating America, and fiercely loving ""Reds"" (Liverpool football team), is the only one Elmo can rely on.
Well, that is a plot, but that is not the point after all, for there are lots of incredible situations: Sam Jackson wearing kilt (for what?), Rhys Ifans's fire-arm dealer (who is deep into yoga), Emily Mortimer's sexy assassin, and you know the film's not taking itself seriously when Meat Loaf appears as the most (intenntionally, I hope) hammy gangster.  Let's forget about coherence and logic.  Just fun, OK?
The director Ronny Yu is well-known for his films in Hong-kong era (which Sam Jackson, executive-producer of this film,  obviously loves), and hilarious, non-sense-filled ""Bride of Chucky"" (which I love).  His shamelessly showy, and often very bawdy style is there again.  The tone of the film is not consistent, jumping from the downright cartoon-ish violence into a romantic love-scene in a bathtub, and then dead-pan humor of Jackson.  The film is brimmed with ""Pulp Fiction""-like energy; only, ""Formula 51"" doesn't know (or doesn't want to know) how to restrain it, to be as organized as Tarantino.  Try to enjoy it as it is; or just stay away.
Finally, some might think Robert Carlyle's wild attitude as football fan is too incredible.  It is not.  If you know the heated supporters of football games; or, famous rivalry between the nearby teams (like, Newcastle vs Sunderland), his character is just authentic.  So, when he sings loudly the hit song of Liverpool-born group Gerry and the Pacemakers ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" in a Manchester pub, the British audience would know what this provoking action means.  (The writer of the film is also a British Stel Pavlou.)  And, believe me or not, his too many ""F"" word is nothing unusual (so, don't be offended).",1044230400,,2557,4.788154897494305
