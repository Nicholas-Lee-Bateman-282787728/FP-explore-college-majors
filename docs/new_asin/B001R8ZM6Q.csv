8337561,4,B001R8ZM6Q,"Watching the movie after seeing the original play is like reading the book before its made into a movie.  No matter how good the movie is, it never measures up to the original.  After seeing this there are no complaints.  The cast knows their craft.  Takes me on a wonderful trip back to yesteryear.",1409097600,2,299,4.481481481481482
