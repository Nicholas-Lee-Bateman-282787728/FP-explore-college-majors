6881810,5,B00QUASTD4,I watched the program on TV and decided to get the videos. Enjoy them very much - love the scenery. Using a chair makes it easy to do in a small space while still benefiting from the yoga stretches. The instructions are easy to follow.,1486252800,7,235,4.2444444444444445

6881815,5,B00QUASTD4,"I'm really loving this new yoga routine.  I'm used to longer deeper breaths from 4 years of Anne Burnell's program so I continue the breathing pattern I'm used to and just do fewer repetitions of the movements.  If Sarah does 6, I might only finish 4.  I like her having more repetitions of each movement to the point I feel fatigue in the muscles because it seems like it does more good than just a few then going on to another one.  One I alternate by John Schlorholtz goes so fast I have to put it on pause here and there so I can continue doing enough reps of a certain movement that it feels like it might be doing some good.  This feels more like real yoga even if you are in a chair than just a yoga-based exercise program.  I will continue doing my others but this is a great addition to my library.  I like to change back and forth to keep from getting bored.  The soft narration is very soothing, there's no distraction between you and the yoga practice.  I would highly recommend this to everyone along with Anne Burnell's chair yoga, and John Schlorholtz.  Each one has a different benefit for your body, although now that I have four of Sarah Starr's I find myself reaching for hers much more often than the others :=).",1461542400,18,1232,4.317391304347826
6881816,5,B00QUASTD4,Beginner yoga disciple. Love the cd. Easy to follow. Have seen very good results.,1459036800,8,81,4.857142857142857
8693019,5,B00QUASTD4,very easy to follow and instructions were very helpful.  no concerns with cd info .,1530144000,,83,4.533333333333333
8693020,1,B00QUASTD4,"The part that I liked the least was the fact that it would not play, and continually skipped to the meditation, which I did not want.  Tried them in 3 different dvd players.",1519171200,3,173,4.242424242424242
8693021,1,B00QUASTD4,Much to fast for my taste and seemed to be more athletic exercise than yoga for people who need to do chair yoga. This did not offer any alternative moves for people who were physically challenged. People who do chair yoga generally cant do it the standard way and this video did not make any allowances for that. Totally useless for me.,1518480000,,337,4.451612903225806
8693022,5,B00QUASTD4,"I have most all of Sarah Starr's Chair Yoga dvds; this one is a recent purchase. And...I love it (and the meditation segment too)..Hers are easy to follow and do. The sunrise background and her chair on the sand poses are so soothing to watch, as you do them.",1517184000,4,259,4.3061224489795915
8693023,3,B00QUASTD4,"I am giving this only three stars because I was under the impression that Yoga was supposed to be about the Breath. In this DVD, the movements went fairly quickly and there was not much attention paid to the breath. I was looking for a yoga routine that wouldnt kill me, but I also wanted one that would cover the importance of mindfulness and breathing. This one didn't do it.",1516838400,,377,4.4
8693024,5,B00QUASTD4,"This is perfect for me.  I have a torn ligament in my left knee making it hard and very painful to get down and up from the floor, so I was looking for something to work my core as well as my body without having to get up and down from the floor.  This is it!  She goes at a pace that I can follow and I can do everything in a chair.  I even get to work on increasing flexibility in my knees (overall body toning) from the chair.  The ocean views and sounds help to relax you  This is perfect for beginners, anyone with injures, or older.",1512086400,9,538,3.889908256880734
8693025,5,B00QUASTD4,"I really like this tape. I am at an age where it is hard to get on and off the floor and theses exercises are ideal for me. They are almost exactly like the ones that you do on the floor, but in a chair.",1509753600,6,203,3.533333333333333
