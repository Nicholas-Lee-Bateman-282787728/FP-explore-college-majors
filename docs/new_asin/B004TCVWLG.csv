8440608,5,B004TCVWLG,"When my middle child was very young, I was at a loss as to what was going on inside of her.  I began a mad search delving into every book I could find, visiting every doctor's office, psychologist, psychiatrist  and many children's therapists to find some answers to the millions of questions I had burning inside of me.  So often, I found myself pondering how some actually obtained their medical degree because they knew nothing that resembled anything that my daughter was going through.  Many wanted to simply shove pills down her throat as quickly as they wanted to shove me out of their door for questioning their lack of knowledge.  By chance, I stumbled upon Janice Papalos' 24: A Day in the Life of a Bipolar Child via youtube and while watching this particular video, she described what a day was like in ""MY"" house.  It was as though she were speaking directly to me, about me, to my daughter, about my daughter and the depth of the internal struggle my child had to deal with on a daily basis.  I cannot recommend this any better than to say, if you suspect your child suffers from bipolar disorder, please run, don't walk to the nearest bookstore or get out your credit card here and now and make this purchase.  It will save you and your child in more ways than I can express.",1341705600,,1290,4.482905982905983
