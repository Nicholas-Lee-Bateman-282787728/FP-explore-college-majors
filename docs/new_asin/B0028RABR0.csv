 We have a new angel in this season but she's no match with farah and for me the first and original three angels SHOULD HAVE REMAINED UNTOUCHED although i liked cheryl as the 4rth angel.
 the original tv series are far superior than the two movies released a few years ago and i reccomend it for your dvd collection.",1242086400,4,421,4.454545454545454
3873043,5,B0028RABR0,"Sony Pictures seems to be making up for lost time!

Charlie's Angels Season 1 was released in 2003.

Charlie's Angels Season 2 was released in 2004.

Charlie's Angels Season 3 was released in 2006.

And now, After 2 years of waiting, Sony Pictures will finally release Charlie's Angels Season 4 on July 21, 2009!

I think it WILL be nice to see Tiffany Welles in action, in her only season.

She would be replaced by Julie Rogers, (the sixth and final angel), in Season 5.

I think Charlie's Angels Season 5, which is the last, should be released sometime in 2010, as a 4-disc set, because that season only has 16 episodes.

Please release the final Season of Charlie's Angels in 2010!",1242000000,8,685,4.557377049180328

3873047,5,B0028RABR0,"I am so glad that I bought this season. I had never seen many of these episodes in reruns and now that I have watched all of them, I think it's one of the strongest of the series. Plus, I agree with several others that Shelley Hack was a great addition to the show. She had a mysterious, elegant, but quirky quality and really had good chemistry with Jaclyn and Cheryl. In fact, if the producers had given her more to do in the first couple of months, I am sure audiences would have embraced her fully. Out of the 26 episodes, the ones in which she is prominently featured (Angels on Campus, Angel Hunt, Angels on the Street, and Of Ghosts and Angels) are the best! If you enjoyed the series and never got to see all of season 4 before, buy this set and enjoy! I did  :)",1439596800,3,770,4.133333333333334

3873058,3,B0028RABR0,"Other people have reviewed the quality of the TV series and, in particular, this episodes of this season. Hence, I will not touch this issue in my review to avoid being repetitive. I will only make a comment for those who are collectors of DVDs and they might buy the fourth season with the plan to keep it for long time.

It turns out that my spouse is a passionate lover of the series and had bought the third season about three years ago. Unfortunately, the manufacturer has used a low quality coating for the DVDs which deteriorated and made them unreadable by the player. This happened for each and all DVDs of this season (and also Season 3) but it did not happen for any of the DVDs of Seasons 1 and 2. I should also mention that we own many thousands of CDs and DVDs and this is the first time we have seen such a serious problem. (CDs and DVDs are supposed to last for many decades if are well made and are taken good care of.) We had to purchase the two seasons again. It is possible that the manufacturer has noticed the problem with its low-quality materials and has now produced good-quality DVDs. However, only time will test it.

If you buy the season just to watch the episodes and you do not care what happens to the DVDs afterwards, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you are a collector, this might be something you want to take into consideration.",1419206400,,1377,4.35408560311284

3873067,4,B0028RABR0,"As we moved into a new decade, Charlie's Angels season 4 (1979/80) was all about change.  Maybe it was brought on by entering the `80s, maybe it was brought on by the departure of Kate Jackson's Sabrina Duncan or maybe it was brought on by the writers/producers occasionally missing the mark.  My opinion is it's all of the above.

The biggest change this season is that the Charlie Girl became one of his angels...  Enter Tiffany Welles (Shelley Hack):  Blonde, beautiful, willowy and wonderfully dressed.  As many have noted, Shelley was given a raw deal in spades.  They started her off not with a bang but a whimper.  She wasn't featured much at all until mid-season.  The audience needed to get to know her.  By the end of the season, we knew her better...and I think most of the audience liked her.  I did.  For the life of me, I can't understand why they didn't keep her on for the fifth season.

The change that I think makes the show problematic this season is the solo episodes, where there is little to no interaction among the three angels while one angel is featured.  Some of these work, and some don't.  Charlie's Angels' appeal runs the gamut from a bonanza of clothes/makeup/hair to camp to a bit of drama, but the true appeal comes by way of the angels' camaraderie.  That always needed to be at the forefront.  Having said that, I found that Cheryl Ladd could always carry a scene or an episode; she has that extra spark.  However, I liked the friendship and the way the angels worked together.

There are some very good episodes here:  I love ""Hannigan's Angel"" ( the chemistry between  Howard Duff and Cheryl Ladd is A++, and he is so endearing.  Other good episodes:  ""Love Boat Angels"" (mixing two of Aaron Spelling's shows), Angels Go Truckin', Angels on Campus (a good insight into Tiffany) and ""Toni's Boy's"" (a pilot that didn't make it but should have!  What's not to love about the male version of Charlie's Angels with Barbara Stanwyck at the helm!)

Other guest stars include:  Bert Convy, Patrick Duffy, Robert Reed, Louis Jourdan, Beverly Garland, Gary Collins, Sally Kirkland, Timothy Dalton, Kim Cattrall and Farrah Fawcett is featured in three episodes.

Charlie's Angels as a series is always five stars for me.  I love it.  I gave this season 4 stars because of the somberness of a few of the episodes and the solo outings.  Still, there's much to love and much to mock too...mostly in the hair department.  Kelly Garrett has bangs this season that are a bit odd, Kris Munroe occasionally wears Heidi braids on top of her head.  Ah, no matter.  You can't ruin the glorious looks of an angel, not even with fuzzy bangs and braids that make you want to yodel.  But the most hilarious to watch for is:  Ed Begley, Jr. as a roller skating star and a hysterical scene in ""Toni's Boys"" with a male stripper who is possibly the most awkward dancer ever.

A good season with some bumps in the road brought on by the powers that be, not Shelley.  But angels can always overcome bumps in the road, so it's still worth the drive.",1409356800,2,3056,4.571955719557195

My favorites of hers was when she went back to her alma mater and helped find the missing girls.  Another one where she helped her friend whose husband was trying to kill her and especially where she and Kris learned to drive the big rigs.  The other one was where there was someone after the Angels and Toni's boys had to help them out.  That would have been a great spin off into a new show.

3873091,4,B0028RABR0,"I really enjoy watching Kate Jackson so I wasn't sure if I would like the series without her or not. In my opinion the show doesn't flow as smoothly as it did with Kate. Cheryl Ladd's character seems to almost be reading her lines, they are spoken short, quick and staccato-like. Shelley Hack's character seems hesitant all the time, hesitant to speak, hesitant in what she says and in how she says it. Jaclyn's Smith's character is the only one that seems to flow, but it's awkward for her to flow when the other 2 are going off in their own direction. So I think the acting is a bit stiff, but it's still a fun show to watch and enjoy.",1355356800,,637,4.2727272727272725

3873094,4,B0028RABR0,"At the end of the third season, we say good-bye to another Angel, Kate Jackson as Sabrina Duncan. At least Sabrina is given a proper good-bye, which was not done for Jill Munroe two years earlier.

With the departure of Kate Jackson, producers went searching for a new Angel. Several up-and-coming actresses were considered, including newcomer Michelle Pfeiffer, Connie Sellecca, Shari Belafonte, and Barbara Bach. Pfeiffer was a personal favorite at first, but her audition didn't show much promise, however, and producers eventually hired Charlie perfume model Shelley Hack as Jackson's replacement.

Hack debuts as Tiffany Welles, a police graduate from Boston, in the season four premiere, ""Love Boat Angels,"" which was a two-part crossover episode with the fellow ABC series, The Love Boat. Tiffany instantly kicks it off with Kelly and Kris and the new trio of Angels begin their adventures.

Season Four has some very interesting episodes: ""Angels Go Truckin',"" ""Angels at the Altar,"" ""Caged Angel,"" ""Angels on the Street,"" and ""Catch a Falling Angel"" among others. This season surely brings more fire from the first two seasons, with unique and mysterious episodes that have secretive plot twists.

Season Four also brings Farrah Fawcett back for three more guest appearances, which too are three great episodes from this season: ""Fallen Angel,"" ""The Prince and the Angel,"" and ""An Angel's Trail"".

My only complaint from this season is that the producers and writers don't seem to show too much interest in Shelley Hack or her character, Tiffany Welles. In Tiffany, the writers show her as a sophisticated and classy lady. She often has very little to do, however, and seems as if she was fitted into episodes pre-written to her casting. It's no wonder the critics and audience didn't like her back then. She was barely in some episodes.

Nonetheless, I don't think the sudden ratings slide during this season was all do to Shelley Hack's entering the series. I think the audience had just grown tired of the show in its entirety, not because of another cast change. The very good episodes from this season were wasted on a shrinking audience, who watched those pitiful episodes from Season Three. I think Cheryl Ladd said it the best: she believed ABC (the show's network) had gotten ""too confident"" that the show would last not matter how many changes. Maybe that was true, maybe not. But don't point the finger at Shelley solely, point at the writers and producers, too.

Overall, I don't think this season will disappoint you. As I have said, it has some very good episodes and some very good plot twists. Give it a try, forget what others have said, give it your own opinion.",1347321600,4,2689,4.9755011135857465

3873098,2,B0028RABR0,"This was when this show actually started down the hill -- the other side. Seasons 1 and 2 were the best. They were exciting, new, light, and not so serious, as it should be, as we wanted it. Season 4 was the season with the heavy serious, even frighting, episodes. This was the dark season. Kelly drugged up. The girl with multiple personalities who had a pimp that beat her up. Etc etc. And of course Shelley Hack seemed to play this arrogant type of character--intentional? Dunno. I even think the other ""angels"" kinda played like they didn't like her--in character? true feelings that showed through?? Dunno. Anyway, this season and the similar Wonder Woman season plus the Bionic Woman season about this time all seemed similiar. Serious. Heavy subjects. Not fun. And some of that stuff . . . to be very honest . . . is confusing for a 6/7year to see. I can remember watching some of these episodes and just feeling creepy inside from what I saw. Just not what a kid should be watching first of all but definitely not what we wanted to see from Charlie's Angels. Also the politics that was shoved in your face back then . . . even as a kid I saw through that. Sickening.",1322784000,,1174,4.439814814814815

3873100,4,B0028RABR0,"I'm not really old enough to have seen ""Charlie's Angels"" during its original run, so perhaps that was why I wasn't so dismayed by Kate Jackson's departure. I thought I would miss Sabrina but I didn't. Not that Jackson didn't bring anything to the show - she was a huge part of it, but I like Shelley Hack (having seen her in ""The Stepfather""), and I don't blame her for the demise of the show, like some do.  I do think in a way Season 4 is an improvement over Season 3 in that the writing for the most part was better.  Not that there weren't some misfires, but overall I think this season came off better.  The mistake was made in the order that they aired - so that Hack's character Tiffany Welles had very little to do and little character development until the end of the season, but by that times the show's ratings had decreased rapidly.  On top of that, I think the public was losing interest and some episodes started to feel repetitive, beginning in the previous season. Unfortunately, the powers-that-be gave Hack her walking papers and went looking for a new Angel for what turned out to be the show's final season.

Tiffany Welles hailed from Boston and like Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith) and Kris Monroe (Cheryl Ladd) was a former police officer.  The ladies sport a more feminine wardrobe than the previous season - which may have had to do with Jackson's leaving the show but may have also hinted at the dawn of the new 80s decade. When she was onscreen long enough to make an impression, Hack's Tiffany established a nice chemistry with her fellow Angels and the lovable Bosley (David Doyle).  Once again, a wonderful array of guest stars make appearances - Farrah Fawcett, fufilling her last contractual guest spots, along with Tab Hunter, Joanna Pettit, Louis Jourdan, Barbara Stanwyck, Patrick Duffy, Robert Reed, Beverly Garland, Caesar Romero, Ed Begley Jr., Robin Mattison, Kim Cattral, Sally Kirkland, Bo Hopkins, Bert Convy, Gary Collins, Dick Sargent, and my personal favorite - Timothy Dalton, who works alongside Farrah in ""Fallen Angel"".

""Fallen Angel"" is a favorite of mine, but as I have a thing for Timothy Dalton, it's no shocker. I also loved especially ""Caged Angel"", ""Angels On The Street"", ""Catch A Falling Angel"", ""Nips And Tucks"", ""Toni's Boys"", ""An Angel's Trail"", ""Angels On Campus"", ""Of Ghost And Angels"", and ""One Of Our Angels Is Missing"".  The only episode I didn't particularly care for was ""The Prince And The Angel"" - probably the weakest of Farrah's guest appearances.  For some reason I found it very bland and uninteresting.  I will say that this season has less duds than the previous one.  Ladd does a great job in ""Caged Angel"" - some might call it a rehashing of Season 1's ""Angels In Chains"", but I found her work to be some of the best she did on the series - and she always gave good performances.  And I loved Kelly and Tiffany's disguises as nuns!  ""Of Ghosts And Angels"" I find very watchable and very haunting - if there was ever an episode I want to be a TV movie, that one would be it.  I don't know why, but I kind of associated ""Angels On Campus"" with the film ""The Deliberate Stranger"" - I guess since the setting and premise is similar.

Season 4 was released sooner than I thought it would be, but perhaps that was intentional since it happened around the time of Farrah's passing in June 2009.  It was a nice tribute to the Angel who first caught the public's imagination. I'm hoping that Season 5 will soon see the light of day.

Watch Season 4 with an open mind. It may surprise you.",1317427200,6,3556,4.582018927444795
3873101,5,B0028RABR0,"This is one of my favorite seasons, its the longest, and I believe that Shelly Hack did not recieve the credit she deserved.
Also it contains the rarely seen pilot for Tony's boys. Although it did not make to series, it is great to see, and really great to see Barbara Stanwyck !",1316476800,3,279,4.283018867924528
3873102,5,B0028RABR0,"I love the fourth season of Charlie's Angels. I thought that Shelley Hack was a great choice to play Tiffany Welles and worked well with Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd. Some of my favorite episodes of the series were during the fourth season: ""Love Boat Angels,"" ""Angels Go Truckin',"" ""Fallen Angel,"" ""Of Ghosts and Angels,"" ""Dancin' Angels,"" ""Catch a Falling Angel,"" and ""Three for the Money.""

While many remember the original Angels (Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and Kate Jackson), I remember fondly the second trio (Cheryl Ladd, Smith, and Jackson) and the third trio (Hack, Smith, and Ladd). I was too young to stay up past 10 PM for the first season and could only watch them during vacation and summer break!

The third trio of Angels is also special to me since I have met all three at personal appearances. All three Angels (Hack, Smith, and Ladd) were extremely nice in person and were very willing to pose for photos with me.

I agree with another reviewer that had the episodes played in a different order, audiences would have probably warmed up to Shelley's portrayal of Tiffany Welles early in the fourth season.

Take a good look at these episodes. There is a lot of enjoyable material here. The Angels indeed look beautiful and stylish in their Nolan Miller wardrobes. The photos selected to illustrate this set are the best of the four DVD sets and it even includes the rarely published fur photos seldom seen in the United States.",1305504000,8,1448,4.756972111553785
3873103,2,B0028RABR0,"The story lines aren't as strong as seasons 1-3. Shelley Hack's acting isn't so great, but I don't think that's why the ratings were low. It's mainly the writing. There were too many Kris Munroe episodes giving Shelley Hack and Jaclyn Smith mere ""supporting roles"" to Cheryl Ladd. If they had balanced it out and given all of the angels starring story lines the season would have been more interesting. Plus, people wanted a chance to see the new angel Tiffany shine, which we didn't get to see. And Jaclyn Smith's role was greatly reduced after Kate Jackson left which is disappointing.",1304035200,,587,4.764705882352941
3873104,5,B0028RABR0,"Season four begins with the departure of Kate Jackson, which was probably a greater loss than anyone could have predicted. After all, Farrah Fawcett left at the end of season one, was replaced by Cheryl Ladd in season two, and the chemistry and ratings remained strong through season three. Altough Farrah had the largest off-screen profile, Kate's was the greatest on screen within the context of the series. Her portrayal of Sabrina Duncan provided the anchor for Farrah/Jaclyn and later Jaclyn/Cheryl. There's a gaping void now that would be difficult to fill.

However, enter Shelley Hack. Beautiful, classy, and intelligent, her persona seems an attempt to straddle the best qualities of Kate and Farrah. The problem was with the specifics of her character. Kate's Sabrina was smart in a ""common sense"" kind of way. Very relatable. Shelley's character, Tiffany, was ""intellectual."" More difficult to demonstrate without seeming aloof, especially given some of the dialogue Shelley had to say. Other problem was that Shelley's character was not featured very often in the first ten or so episodes. The season was nearly half-way over with before she was given a featured storyline. This season marks the only one where many episodes were effectively solo efforts by each angel. If Cheryl was featured in one episode, Jaclyn and Shelley were limited to only a couple of scenes for that entire show. The next episode might feature Shelley, with Jaclyn and Cheryl in the background. It just didn't work as well in my opinion.

That being said, I still enjoyed this season and loved Shelley Hack. If you stick around until the last half of the season you'll notice that Shelley, Jaclyn, and Cheryl begin to develop an on-screen chemistry that was present during CA's first three seasons. It's also fun to watch Jaclyn and Cheryl, as Kelly and Kris, try to navigate with a new ""angel"" on board. (Similiar to Kate and Jaclyn when Cheryl joined two years earlier.)

For me, the best episodes this season are:
Angels Go Truckin' (Shelley's character is given equal screen time)
Fallen  Angel (Farrah returns for her 4th appearance since leaving after season one)
Angels On The Street (the ending may be a surprise for some)
Angel Hunt (not necessarily an original story, but quite possibly one of the best episodes of the entire series)
Cruisin Angels (team-oriented story that has some funny moments)
Three For The Money (great team episode and Shelley shines in her portrayal of a political aide)
Toni's Boys (fun idea for a possible spin-off series that never sold)

If Shelley had been brought back for Season Five, it would have been fun to watch her continue to develop her character. Still, Season Four gets Five stars from me!",1287705600,8,2730,4.978070175438597
3873105,5,B0028RABR0,"By the 4th season there was plenty of anticipation with the promotion of advertising a new angel, a combination of merging 2 shows into one, and the NEW direction for the show. Jaclyn & Cheryl return to reclaim their roles. Shelley Hack, former model of t.v.'s ""Charlie"" fragrance ads made her super noticeable and a prime candidate to be the new angel! She would play angel, Tiffany Welles from Boston, who's father was a good friend of Charlie's.  Unfortunately, the season would not play out in Shelley's favor. First, her character would not be properly worked into the script until late into the season, Secondly, their were network issues behind the scenes that demanded to get more noticability to the show since it was slacking in the ratings. Unfortunately, since Shelley was new kid on the block and writer's did not utilize her character right, she had the least likability factor so she would be terminated at the end of the season. However, this season boasts higher fashion and a more serious turn in the show. Some of the best episodes, in my opinion, are here in the 4th season. Ecspecially, the last 2 episodes of the season, the 2-part ""One Love...Two Angels"" in which we see for the 1st time a wedge drawn between Kelly & Kris who for the last 3 years have been extremely united as a team and were always there for each other and in this episode we see conflict within the team! It's up to Tiff to pull the team back together...before her exit.  This season Farrah Fawcett also returned to fulfill her obligations to her last 3 guest starring roles as Jill Munro, another exciting factor to the season. But, this season also contains other highlighted episodes such as ""Angels On The Street"", ""Fallen Angel"", ""Love Boat Angels"", & ""Angel Hunt."" Definitely a season that deserves to be in your DVD collection!",1285977600,5,1827,4.724137931034483
3873106,4,B0028RABR0,"When ""Charlie's Angels"" returned for its fourth season in September 1979, fans were eager to see if the new Angel replacing Kate Jackson could inject some new life into the aging series. Though Cheryl Ladd had sustained the show after Farrah's sudden departure, the stories in the third season had started to become very repetitive and the writing rather weak. These factors may have even been part of the reason for Kate's departure.

Nevertheless, Season Four set a somewhat different tone for the show right from the premiere episode, ""Love Boat Angels"". Viewers had come to expect exotic locales and exciting action sequences in the season premieres. While the former certainly applied here, the latter unfortunately was lacking. We had a lame scuffle aboard the Pacific Princess that involved Cheryl Ladd pulling a gun on the thugs beating on Bo Hopkins and Bert Convy; later, a dull car chase and two routine kidnappings. Even the big set piece, the underwater scuba chase is not very exciting. New Angel Shelley Hack does not make much of a splash, foreshadowing the minimal role she will have for about the next seven episodes) aside from firing shots from a speedboat during the climax.

Shelley Hack's modeling background had Aaron Spelling proudly proclaiming ""We're bringing back the glamour"". The clothing budget for this season was astronomical, with Nolan Miller working his magic on the three actresses. It should be noted that the wardrobes for Smith, Ladd and Hack became very sophisticated this year, with lots of designer skirts, blouses and suits replacing the more casual togs of the Kate Jackson era. The problem was that classing up the act made Kelly, Kris and Tiffany blend together like some Supermodel Task Force. The much-needed contrast of a more earthy/edgy Angel was missing and hurt the chemistry. (Tanya Roberts' character was initially created to spice up the mix next season).

And so lies the problem with Season Four: lack of interaction between Jaclyn, Cheryl and Shelley, unimaginative action/stunts and too many solo Angel stories. Even Farrah's return guest spots are uninspired, save for the first one ""Fallen Angel"", which is perhaps the best episode of the six she filmed after quitting the show as a regular.

Yet, ""Charlie's Angels"" proved it could still deliver the goods when the writing hit the mark. ""Angel Hunt"", ""Angels on Campus"" and ""Angels on the Street"" are among the season's best, and some of the most memorable shows filmed, even including the Kate Jackson era. It seems this season had an Old-Hollywood vibe running through it, due to some of the guest stars such as Barbara Stanwyck, Cesar Romero, and Howard Duff. Many of the scripts could have been inspired by old movies: ""Of Ghosts and Angels"" from ""Rebecca""; ""Caged Angel"" from ""Caged""; ""Angel Hunt"" from ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Even the season-finale ""One Love...Two Angels"" plays more like an old Lana Turner ""women's picture"" than your typical episode of ""Angels"".

Shelley Hack was used as a scapegoat for the show's sagging ratings, when in truth, they probably would have dipped even lower had the interest generated by a new Angel not had viewers still tuning in. While her performances are somewhat stiff at times, Hack was in no way the kiss of death for this series, and could have easily made the transition to Season Five had the producers not axed her.

As far as the product itself, the episodes on this set look better than I've ever seen them on TV. They are all unedited, save for the season premiere, which is edited into two episodes from its original two-hour running time. The cover art is fantastic, the best so far for this series. Sony was wise to enlist the aid of fans to get the box art just right. Some of their other work on sets like ""Bewitched"" was just atrocious. Unfortunately, aside from the first release, ""Charlie's Angels"" has been treated poorly in the way of bonus features. A show with such a high pop-culture profile should have at least some cast commentaries over select episodes. Regardless, I was shocked when Sony announced this title, as I thought they had long-abandoned it. Now if we could only get them to finally give us the final season, or license it to Shout! Factory.

I recommend this set if you already own the previous three. You may be pleasantly surprised that the dirt thrown on this season back in 1979-80 was very unwarranted and it rightfully belongs in the collection of any Angels fan. Is it Award-winning Emmy-worthy TV? Not at all. But it IS definitely an entertaining time capsule of the end of the disco era when satin hot pants, feathered hairdos and big luxury cars ruled.",1278115200,5,4664,4.89620253164557

At Wal-Mart they started selling 2 Seasons of some shows for $20. I bought Seasons 1 and 2 in one package and Seasons 3 and 4 in one package.

This is the season in which the brainy and perfect Sabrina Duncan, we're told, has remarried her ex-husband Bill from season one and is having a baby. So Kate Jackson has left. The only person who could possibly replace her would be...the incomparable Shelley Hack. Unfortunately, the actress, who plays Tiffany Welles, got shafted in many episodes with too little work, too few lines, too little screen time. She is often and unfairly targeted as the Angel who killed Charlie's Angels, but really, the ratings of season four were much higher (# 21 for the season) than when poor Tanya Roberts's Julie replaced Hack's Tif in season five and the show fell below Nielsen's top 50--and was thus canceled in 1981. This is the season whose best episode stars Hollywood legend Barbara Stanwyck. She plays Charlie's old friend Antoinette, a.k.a.

This was Shelly Hack's only season on the show. She was fired after this season, mainly because it was felt her character was ""too boring."" I would disagree with them on that. I'd forgotten how elegant and classy she was.

Charlie's Angels was one of those unfortunate series that got progressively worse as it went on. But the formula of 3 beautiful women fighting crime still remains a crowd pleaser after all these years.",1252713600,2,755,4.463768115942029

Shelley's portrayal of Tiffany Welles was mature, classy and added a touch of sophistication to a show that while entertaining, sometimes could be cartoonish. And let's face it, none of the other Angels could touch Shelley in the way she showed off those glamorous Nolan Miller costumes. I found her to be beautiful, classy AND talented! Too bad the producers could not recognize these facts and hastily swept Shelley(Tiffany) out the door and replaced her with Tanya Roberts(Julie Rogers), the Angel who was totally out of place and never fit with the show!

3873121,4,B0028RABR0,"Right off the bat in the first episode you can see that the series took its first huge change of direction. We see a new girl to replace Sabrina Duncan (Kate Jackson)- Tiffany Welles (Shelley Hack), more color, faster pace in plots and dialogue, and a more girly kind of vibe. The plots seem the same (I think), but they just cut to the chase quite faster and don't leave room for you to think too much. Shelley Hack does a good job I feel and she ups the anty in the beauty and fashion areas, and I don't believe that she killed the ratings it was the writers fault. Saying that Kate Jackson made the show is giving her too much credit. My favorite Angel, Kris Munroe (Cheryl Ladd), is still here and Jaclyn Smith too; they were the true angels because they stayed the longest. Overall season 4 is very different than season's 1-3 and I feel it was changed to give the show something more to look at visually that exudes girliness, fashion, fun, and less to think about because everything is served to you quickly. As are most complaints in Charlies Angels episodes in all the season's, the recipes for the episodes don't really change much. They should have made this season darker and dangerous to combat the girliness and colorfulness that this season brought, oh well.

The stories were much better than remembered and the edition of Shelley Hack added a new dimension to the series.  It is just too bad that Spelling/Goldberg couldn't leave well enough alone and allow Shelley and the writers to grow into the show.

This season gave room to each angel to have more room to grow and to have the focus on them.

This also marked Farrah Fawcett's last season in guest roles and in lieu of her recent passing - very bitter sweet.

Also this is far and away the BEST packaging of the series.  The artwork is fantastic and each disc features mulitple shots of each Angel - including Farrah.

There were several things, which hurt Season 4: No. 1, the decesion to have more solo stories of the angels. In the beginning, we saw Kelly stuggle with a heroin addict, Kris goe to jail, but didn't see the group as a team. The solo episodes with Tiffany are some of the best, the episodes of Tiffany at college, as a prositute, in a haunted house are some of the best. Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd at this time do not act as well as they did in the previous seasons. It is almost like they are ready for the show to end, so they can start their own solo successful careers. Also, the first episodes minimized Shelly's role. She didn't even get her star spolight in her first episode. As Cheryl Ladd stated, ""Shelly, took a lot of crap."" She really did. Shelly's acting is just as good as the rest of the crew. It was a shame that Shelly was written out of the show. Tanya Roberts couldn't save the show either. As a result, this was another cruel Hollywood story where someone else was blamed for the down ratings. Enjoy the dvd and remember Shelly Hack.

3873126,4,B0028RABR0,"FINALLY! All of us ""Angel Enthusiasts"" can finally sit back, relax and enjoy the fourth season (and one of the best) of this iconic series!

I was an impressionable seven year old when ""Charlie's Angels"" debuted in 1976. I grew up idolizing these beautiful ladies! I had both of the board games (one with Farrah, the other with Cheryl), all of the paperback books that were released and I even had all four of the dolls (where they ended up, I will NEVER know!). I had the Farrah poster, and an oversized poster of ""Sabrina, Kelly & Kris"" from ""Circus of Terror"". TRUE FAN in every sense of the word.

I purchased the first three seasons on the day of their release. I was looking at the issue of Entertainment Weekly that I received today and read about the 7/21/09 release! YIPPEE!!

Shelley Hack was a great addition to the series and was definitely given a raw deal! They certainly should have incorporated her more into the storylines early on. I found out that the episodes aired out of sequence and that could have been a HUGE reason America never warmed up to ""Tiffany Welles"". Had they shown ""Angels On Campus"" and another few episodes earlier on, ratings WOULD have been significantly different! So, all of you naysayers give Ms. Hack a break! She was a dynamic addition and did some great work (with what she was given).

It is a nice way to remenber Farrah Fawcett as well. She will be missed, and I am so glad that her pain is now gone. We will all be thinking of you as an ""Angel"" watching over us!

Right from Death Car On The Freeway.  Some of my favorite episodes in season 4 are Angels Go Trucking, Of Ghost and Angels, Angel Hunt, Angels On The Sreets, To Catch A Falling Angel, and Angels on Campus.  I don't think it was fair to blame Shelley for the fall in ratings.  I think if they showcased her more and made her the focal story of Love Boat Angels, I think the ratings would have stayed high.  When they started having some episodes focus on one angel the other two were sort of used as set decoration
The DVD's have some great art work for the fourth season.  They have awesome pictures of what the dics and what the cover art is going to be. I just love Sony TV DVD's.  They spend the extra money for art, music, and complete unedited shows.  Sony is the best when it comes to TV shows on DVD.

3873128,5,B0028RABR0,"The fourth season of CHARLIE'S ANGELS, which aired on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on ABC from September 1979 through May 1980, is possibly the season that yields the most dramatic changes in the series, namely Shelley Hack becomes the newest angel, ""Tiffany Welles"", filling the slot vacated by original actress Kate Jackson. Returning for another tour of duty this season are ""Kelly Garret"" and ""Kris Munroe"", played by Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd respectively, along with faithful sidekick ""Bosley"", played by David Doyle. Farrah Fawcett's ""Jill Munroe"" also makes her final three appearances of the series.

With the new angel, also comes a new overall look to the series. With Hack, a former fashion model, on board, all three actresses don dresses, gowns, and tailored suits more often than casual wear. And while attention is taken away from the flesh (the Angels wear fewer bathing suits this season than ever before), the Angels never looked classier and more stunning in their wardrobe. The result is mature, professional-looking Angels that seem to have come a long way from the earlier days of the show when they rarely wore bras.

Aside from a new angel and a new look, the significant change that takes place this season that differentiates it from its predecessors is the writing style. Unlike the writing from season three which, at times, is dull and underwhelming, season four's writing includes several intriguing storylines that are largely the contribution of guest writers. ANGELS ON CAMPUS, ANGEL HUNT, FALLEN ANGEL, and THREE FOR THE MONEY are guest writer-contributed scripts and consequently, they are among the season's highlights as they are solid episodes that demonstrate the series' potency and vitality, even in its fourth season. The writing style also differs with certain episodes straying from the usual team formula, instead showcasing a single Angel while the other two Angels and Bosley are relegated to the background. A final aspect of the writing that changes is the overall tone, with some episodes (AVENGING ANGEL, CATCH A FALLING ANGEL, ANGEL'S CHILD, ANGELS ON THE STREET) tackling social issues such as drug abuse, pornography, child abuse, and prostitution with greater urgency than had been seen before in the series.

However, an aspect of the writing this season that backfired is intentionally minimizing the role of new angel ""Tiffany"" in the first several episodes. Two episodes in particular, ANGELS ON CAMPUS and ANGEL HUNT, are pivotal because the former establishes the back story and character of ""Tiffany"" and the latter validates the newest angel's position in the group and fleshes out all three angels' profound concern for each other. It's safe to assume these two episodes were among the first ones filmed because clips from them appear in the opening credits, yet unfortunately they did not air until almost halfway through the season. This was a poor decision on behalf of the producers/creators that damaged the series because it prevented the new angel (and actress) from instantly impressing and clicking with audiences. For this reason, Hack often, and rather unfairly, earns the odium from some fans as the death knell to the series. To remedy this, a simple rearranging of the initial episodes of the season would suffice: LOVE BOAT ANGELS, ANGELS GO TRUCKIN', ANGELS ON CAMPUS, ANGEL HUNT, FALLEN ANGEL, followed by OF GHOSTS AND ANGELS. Had these episodes aired in a similar sequence, perhaps the course of the series would have been quite different, with ""Tiffany"" continuing to work for Charles Townsend and Associates into the fifth season.

The only genuine flaw in the DVD set is the inclusion of the syndicated 2-part version of the season premier, LOVE BOAT ANGELS, instead of the original unedited print. The set is presented in a similar format to that of the third season set, with an outer box that houses 3 slim plastic DVD cases. Each case holds 2 discs and features a different group photo of the Angels on the cover, with episode titles, synopses, and original air dates on the back, and several photos of the Angels, Bosley, and the season's numerous guest stars (Patrick Duffy, Kim Cattrall, Timothy Dalton, Robert Reed, Barbara Stanwyck, etc.) throughout. Aesthetically, this is easily the best presentation of all CHARLIE'S ANGELS season sets. Mike Pingel of the Charlie's Angels website and SONY have put together a beautiful product, which is only fitting as it reflects such beautiful Angels.",1247529600,71,4482,5.127222982216142
3873129,4,B0028RABR0,"I am so glad season 4 of CHARLIE'S ANGELS was finally released.  I can't wait to watch this season.  Unlike the previous 3 seasons, I probably haven't seen a lot of these episodes.  I do remember when Farrah Fawcett returned as Jill Munroe.  Most of the scenes with Jill were just with her sister Kris (Cheryl Ladd.)  We were deprived a Kelly, Kris, Tiffany- and Jill scene.  By this time, ABC and Farrah may have just wanted done with these obligitory appearances. Regardless, the viewers lost out.
I find it rather revealing that CHARLIE'S ANGELS suffered the loss of Kate Jackson (as Sabrina Duncan) more than that of Farrah Fawcett.  I think there were many factors at play here.  Firstly, Cheryl Ladd was perfect casting as Jill's SISTER Kris Munroe.  It certainly didn't hurt that Kris was introduced as Jill's little sister who went to the police academy in San Francisco.  It was easier to accept.  Also- CHARLIE'S ANGELS was on the upswing in the late 70's.  Shelley Hack's replacement of Kate Jackson was not nearly as effortless.  Hack was basically hired because she was ""the Charlie girl"" from those perfume ads.  Some said her acting skills weren't exactly top notch.  However, Hack's Tiffany Wells wasn't exactly given a fair shake either.  Tiffany was introduced into the show (she was from Boston) and kind of languished in the background as things like the Love Boat took center stage.  It wasn't until later in the season that Tiffany started to blossom.  But it was too late.  Up next was Tanya Roberts.  At least Tiffany was a cop, next Angel Julie Rogers was a model(?)",1247443200,9,1591,4.758241758241758
3873130,5,B0028RABR0,"Season 4 of Charlie's Angels is sometimes seen as the beginning of the end of the show but for me it has always been a season filled with intriguing stories, class and a blossoming friendship with the new angel, Tiffany Welles.  Shelley Hack has been unfairly criticized in many circles as the person most responsible for the downfall of the once mighty ratings giant, but facts prove that wrong.  Shelley's first episode, Love Boat Angels was a top 10 show and CA was in the top 20 for the season overall which wasn't too shabby.  No the mistake was made by the producers who pulled the plug on the classy angel far too soon.  Speaking of Love Boat Angels, the series introduces us to a Boston police academy graduate who graduated at top of her class, not exactly modeling school but Kelly and Kris seem content with her.  Love Boat Angels is a fine showcase for popular angel, Kris Munroe, played by Cheryl Ladd and it tells a very clever story.
  Although season 1 of the show is my favorite, my favorie episode of all time is in season 4 and that is Angel Hunt.  This is a terrific episode where the angels must rely solely on their own wits and each other to survive against a man hunting them down.  This is also a great episode because one can see the close bond forming between Tiffany and her fellow angels.  They come to depend on each other and show courage in the face of nearly impossible odds.
  Season 4 also delves into more serious topics such as child abuse, drug addiction and corruption within prison.  These episodes are adeptly handled and showcase a more mature sensibility in the show.
  Three for the Money is an outstanding con game put on by the Angels in order to regain a client's money and Homes $weet Homes has a nice mix of comedy with a thrilling conclusion.
  Other notable episodes include Toni's Boys which was a potential CA spinoff that also did a riff on the Cask of Amontillado by Poe, Angels on Campus which was the perfect setting for the well bred Tiffany Welles and gives Shelley Hack a chance to shine, and One Love, Two Angels perhaps the most controversial CA episode ever as it pits two angels against one another.
  The set also includes the final guest appearances of Farrah Fawcett.  These episodes run the gambit from excellent, Fallen Angel to awful, The Prince and the Angel but still it is fun to see Farrah's final bows as an angel.
  I certainly recommend this set and think that it will only enhance your fondness for the angels.",1247356800,14,2488,4.506696428571429
3873131,5,B0028RABR0,"I am so glad to know that season four will finally be released on DVD, and even though Kate Jackson is missed in that season, Shelly Hack was really not all bad, you just gotta get to know the character well. Pity she got replaced by Tanya whats her name. The best part is this is the final three episodes with Farrah Fawcett, rest in peace by the way, The one of her spots i look forward to seeing again is when her Jill Monroe character appears to have turned to a life of crime. The perfect way to remember Farrah, but the other shows like Truckin Angels, and the best one of al Angel Hunt will be well worth seeing again and again.

UPDATE
After looking at season four i can really get into some of the episodes that i had not gotten into before. I will also say that there are many who say that Cheryl
Ladd was given some grief for being that ""replacement"" angel, but seriously, it was Shelly Hack that really got screwed by the producers in the long run. Looking at her in the series, and especially at the solo episodes, she was in ( Angels on Campus, Ghosts and Angels) she was a really great actress and very classy all around. She is really like a fine wine, you just got to appreciate her over time. I also really get into the episode Avenging Angel which i did not like at first because you see the streetwise side of the character Kelly Garret like never before, and that it takes on the dark side of drug addiction like no other piece of film in its time ever did. Had Shelly Hack been given more airplay in the beginning she might had lasted another season. This set was worth the wait, and it ironically was timed with the passing of Farrah Fawcett, but those episodes with her in it were great to see again. May season five for all it was worth be out soon.",1247011200,5,1774,4.202346041055718
3873132,5,B0028RABR0,"I'll be perfectly honest, season four of 'Charlie's Angels' was by no means the best season of the series (seasons 1 and 2 are by far the highlights of the series).  However, it is about time this season comes to DVD.  It's a season that fans have been waiting for.  Hopefully we once again won't have to wait too long to get season five of the series.
Shelley Hack made her less than stellar debut as Tiffany Welles, the sophisticated, east-coast Angel.  While she did her best, one can't get over the lack of chemistry between Tiffany and Kelly and Kris.  The chemistry between Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd remains solid however, so it's always a treat to see scenes between the two of them.
Season four also marks the final guest appearances of Farrah Fawcett as first season Angel, Jill Munroe.  Other notable guest-stars include iconic actress, Barbara Stanwyck and Kim Cattrall.
While not the best season of the series, season four of 'Charlie's Angels' contained some highlights of the series, the debut episode of the show features a cross-over event with Aaron Spelling's other hit 70's series, 'The Love Boat.'  Other highlights include 'Angel Hunt,' 'Fallen Angel,' and 'One Love...Two Angels.'",1246665600,5,1205,4.906403940886699

3873140,5,B0028RABR0,"It has been nearly three years since Sony released the third season of ""Charlie's Angels"" on DVD, but finally the fourth season of this classic crime drama arrives in stores on July 21, 2009. Not as great a season as previous ""Charlie's Angels's"" seasons, the fourth year brought the biggest change to the show as Kate Jackson no longer appears in it. After Aaron Spelling refused her time off to film ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" the year before, Kate walked off the show, and her disappearance is evident. The loss of Kate was suicide for the show. The producers replaced her with Shelley Hack, who played Tiffany Wells. Hack was a feature in the television commercials for ""Charlie Perfume"". Most of the audience, including this reviewer, never warmed up to Hack. I always felt her portrayal was cool and unlikable. The producers and the network felt the same way as Hack last this one season, only to be replaced by another actress in season five.
 25 episodes are included in this boxset, and there are no special features. What makes this year wonderful, however, are the special guest appearances by some of the best Hollywood stars inluding Ceasar Romero, Barbara Stanwyck, Patrick Duffy, Robert Reed, Timothy Dalton, and a pre ""Sex and the City"" Samantha, Kim Cattrell. Farrah Fawcett also makes her final appearance this year in three episodes.
 Many controversial storylines are covered this year including prostitution, ponorgraphy, and drugs.

I rated this 6-disc DVD set just four stars because the original two-hour ABC network version of ""Love Boat Angels"" wasn't included.
The two-part syndicated version of ""Love Boat Angels"" was included instead.
""Love Boat Angels"" originally aired on ABC on September 12, 1979 as a two-hour episode, not a two-part episode.
Following the opening credits, Part 2 opens with several minutes worth of recap scenes from Part 1.
I was very surprised that the two-part syndication version had a combined running time of 105 minutes and 15 seconds.

The fourth season of ""Charlie's Angels"" originally aired on ABC from September 12, 1979 until May 7, 1980.

There weren't any teasers included in any of the episodes on this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 6-disc DVD set.
It might be possible that each of these episodes didn't have teasers when these episodes originally aired on ABC.

Shelley Hack's only season on ""Charlie's Angels"" was the fourth season.
She replaced Kate Jackson, who had departed ""Charlie's Angels"" following the end of the third season.

Farrah Fawcett made her final ""Charlie's Angels"" appearances in the fourth season.
