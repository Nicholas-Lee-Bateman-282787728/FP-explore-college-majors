The plot itself revolves around Yuta, a freshman high school student who is trying to act like a normal kid after spending much of his middle school years in a delusional fantasy where he believed that he was someone called Dark Flame Master.  But, now he just wants that to forget that Dark Flame Master ever existed, and to start fresh at his new school.  There's just one problem.  The girl upstairs is also a Chunibyo(a person stuck in a similar fantasy as Yuta once was), and now she could unravel everything he has tried so hard to hide.

The best way to describe the genre of this anime is to call it a slice of life anime that also has elements of fantasy, comedy, drama, and of course strong friendship bonds that especially makes for very likable characters.

If you haven't seen Love Chunibyo & Other Delusions it's available on Hulu, and I understand that this set is expensive, but this is a review of the show itself, and of course product information.  Right now rightstuf has this set for under $80.

This collector's edition contains episodes 1-13 plus an eye patch; stickers; postcards; a keychain; and a 152-page art booklet packed with character information, commentary with the Japanese director and actors, and more.

Special Features: Chuni-Shorts, Japanese Promos, Clean Opening Animation, Clean Closing Animation.

Spoken Languages: English, Japanese, English subtitles.

Probably my favorite collector box.",1468886400,,90,5.066666666666666
6604908,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"Loved the anime and had to get them on DVD. This also has the option for dubbed but i still prefer subbed, Rikka's voice is so damn cute in the subbed version.",1463616000,,159,4.0
6604909,4,B00MZ3X9O4,"I was really surprised at how good this show was. Like a few other people have said, the ending is kinda rushed and strange (people gaining and losing Chunibyo and then just as quickly reversing again!). But other than that I think the show is one of the better school shows with its unique exploration of a ""problem"" in Japanese society. I also give it props for not becoming a harem anime as it SOOO easily could have (1 main guy and 4 main girls). I have been into Anime for 10 years now and can't figure out why the Japanese are so obsessed with kids in their shows but whatever. This show is worth a watch even if your not into the whole kid thing.

HOWEVER, please watch it first before you buy it if you're not 100% sure it's your thing because of how much it costs. It's along the lines of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya but hilariously shows how fake their ""powers"" are. Amazon has the subtitled version for free on Prime and apps like Anime Hub and Crunchy Roll have it for free to watch as well but are sub only like Amazon.

Honestly this set is a steal for how much they charge for a Limited Edition Box Set that rivals those of pre-Recession box sets without the price hike! I paid over $300 for Haruhi Suzumiya and many other shows that are only one season
 long way back when. So if you like Extras this is worth the coin.",1461283200,,1341,4.23046875

6604917,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"It's amazing to me that Japanese has a word for this phenomenon- growing up, falling in and out of delusions of my own, I never imagined this to be documented, or even acknowledged by anyone outside of my own world. This anime hits close to home for me, as I suspect it does for many others, as well.",1444867200,,300,4.189655172413793

The anime, it's just perfect with a ton of humour, a very nice romantic comedy very sweet, I'm not good for express this but worth it, I prefer enjoy this kind of series and laugh for a time is most beneficial and useful.",1444348800,,496,4.166666666666667

6604922,3,B00MZ3X9O4,I am extremely  pleased  with this item most boxsets  that come with stuff are pretty light on the extras but this one blew me away the content  of the art book alone was worth it. I have issues with the blue rays region codes not playing on my player for some reason  ( my player is the correct  region for these) however the dvds work fine (i have seen this issue  before and I asure you it is a problem  with my player and not the disc itself) I still strongly  recommend  this boxset to any fan of the series,1441324800,,512,4.03
6604923,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"This anime is grate but this collectors edition is awesome! Ive seen anime you can buy that only has 4 episodes in it and is about $65 *cough Kill La Kill *cough *cough (still a good anime but god dam), but for like $74 you get all this stuff just look at everything you get! Not only does it come with the subbed AND dubbed versions but it comes with Blu-ray and DVD sets to, just in case your one of the few people that don't actually have a Blu-ray player (Like me) not to mention the bookmarks, 152 page hardcover book, wallet chain, art boards, and everything else! Now for the anime, it f***en rocks you my have herd that the 2nd season isn't good but that's a load of crap its just as good as the 1st season. I may be biased because its my favorite anime but its my favorite because is really good, its not some anime where you couldn't give less of a s*** about the characters its actually dam good at making you feel something, well me at least, and I'm pretty cold sometimes. So yes it is a very good anime and if your a big fan and are wondering if you should get this or not, get it. If you don't want to shell out $74 then you can find the entire anime dubbed and subbed without all this sweet stuff here on amazon or on sentai film work's (The people that licensed and dubbed this anime) website.

TLDR Too long didn't read ver: If your a fan and your wondering whether you should buy this, yes you should you won't be disappointed. If you think $74 is over priced  you could spend $80 on a video game or popular anime and not get s*** compared to this. This is a amazing anime and this is one of the best collectors editions I've seen.",1439942400,2,1650,4.12111801242236
6604924,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"This boxset is nothing short of beautiful. I was in love with every extra that came along in here (except for the ridiculous novelty eyepatch which is just hilarious). The art book is also not the greatest, nothing really caught my eye in there and it looked like it was just screencaps? I haven't really given it a thorough look yet though. The main box is gorgeous with a shiny holographic finish in the light. My favorite part though had to be the art boards which are just beautiful and cute.
Lastly, the anime. If you haven't seen the anime, it is fantastic. It is very much a slice of life, but it throws in wonderful comedy and fantasy elements without going over the top or pulling you out of the shows reality. The characters are lovable and the voices fit perfectly. (I have only seen one episode of the dub and it sounded awful, but don't hold me to that, I will still sit down and give it a watch with the dubs to be sure).",1439856000,,935,4.288135593220339

On top of being a quality blu ray release with added English dub exclusive to the physical release this heavy chipboard is packed with collectibles. From its eyepatch, key chain, art cards, bookmarks, and booklet all of these extras (and more) have a great deal of work put into them.

I am a guy that love a cute love story, this is definitely just that. The box set is nice and comes with a lot of cool items. I bought this when it was around $90 dollars, no regrets. I would be more than happy to spend at least $120. This would make a nice gift for someone you know that likes/Loves Anime. 5 out of 5.",1431561600,,478,3.79

That being said I will review the contents of the box rather then the show itself. Inside you recieve a cosplay eyepatch, wallet chain, holographic card, four bookmarks, several art boards, double sided postcards, a keychain, a 3d art card and several stickers.

The quality of the art boards cards and 3d card are all pretty much standard print so they are sturdy if not incredibly durable. The bookmarks are a little flimsy standard freebie bookmark materiel so handle with care!",1429574400,3,560,4.88421052631579
6604933,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"A fantastic set! The packaging is very beautiful and well put together. The case has a nice shine to it and feels sturdy. I mainly got the set to watch the series but the included physical extras were pretty nice. My favorite was the key chain that came with it. All of the art is cool too. The blu-ray itself looks great and it includes S1, an OVA, and 6 mini original shorts. The series ended up being fantastic too so it was well worth the money. RIKKA IS EVERYTHING :D My only gripe with the set is that it is DVD sized, but since the box makes for a great display piece that's not really a big deal. Highly recommended.",1429228800,4,624,4.1652892561983474

Other than the physical aspect, the show itself is great. Cute quirky love story with good animation and character design.

kyoto Animation Company is very rare to let his own anime publish for US Blu-ray version. One more, This is a Limited Edition Box and it is very very beautiful (according to vedio).

6604944,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"Love Chunibyo, addresses the challenges of maintaining individuality while complying with the social expectations of growing up with a thoughtful, surprisingly tender teenage romance. Rikka's connection with Yuuta (the boy) fosters her desire to move past the childish, middle school behavior, and his involvement with her leads to the realization that something important is lost by completely casting off the dreams of childhood. Both voice tracks artfully match the look and feel of the graphics and both do an excellent job conveying meaning. After reading the other reviews and comments, I went back & watched both the dubbed and subbed versions again, and found both superb. For all their differences, the storyline, action, and purpose are identical in the Japanese and the English tracks.

That being said, directorial & voice/acting choices make the two versions seem a little different. In the Japanese version, Yuuta's voice is lower, making him sound older than 15 or 16. In the dub, he sounds definitely like a beginning high-schooler. The Japanese and English VAs playing Rikka are equally expressive, but the inflection is different. On the Japanese soundtrack, Rikka sounds significantly younger than 15  (11 or 12 to me). On the other hand, the English-speaking Rikka sounds naive, but more age appropriate. Both are quite animated, but I find the voice of the English-speaking actress more emotionally complex than that of the Japanese-speaking actress.

Having the characters sound age appropriate, makes It seem like they are navigating the challenges and expanding possibilities of growing up together (instead of  a high school Lolita fantasy). For that reason, like the dub better than the sub. I admit it: that's a matter of personal taste.  I look at dub/sub sets as a graphic track matched to a sound track (either Japanese, English, or other). Let's face it, those pictures aren't really talking. The only question is whether or not sound artfully and believably integrates the script with the graphics. In this case, it does so.",1422662400,8,2056,5.2560975609756095
6604945,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"This is one of my favorite anime series.  I pre-ordered it on Rightstuf, and I got my collectors edition a month early!

The set does truly come with everything pictured.  I have the cellphone charm on my phone right now.  I do love it.  I have not checked out the DVD quality yet, I've seen it in full on blu-ray though, so I can say, it looks great.
Sound quality is fantastic, though dub is decent at best.
All the characters sound as I thought they would minus Rikka.  I can't get behind her voice actor.  Doesn't click with me.

As for the series itself, its nowhere near the greatest thing ever written, but it is fun.  It is a slice-of-life romantic comedy.  It has fantasy elements, and actually does start to touch into emotions and psychology a little bit.
Fun series over all, and great collector's edition.",1422662400,6,818,4.466216216216216
6604946,1,B00MZ3X9O4,"I like anime dubs. There are plenty of good ones out there. Even Sentai has some good ones. (Kill Me Baby, for instance.) This dub, however, is... atrocious. That's what I get for buying blind, I guess. Meg McDonald already ruined the Garupan dub, and now you're putting her in another lead role? If I had known she voiced Rikka, I NEVER would have bought this. Who is even running your ADR department, Sentai?

I mean, at least it's not a s***ty joke dub like Watamote was. But it's still very bad. This is definitely going on eBay, and I feel sorry for whoever ends up with it.

I know the 12-year-old fanboys and Sentai employees are going to downvote the hell out of this review, but I don't care. Someone needs to give an honest review of this. Sentai Filmworks are guilty of multiple war crimes against anime, and voice acting in general. You people should be ashamed.

This gets 1 star instead of the 2 it should have gotten, because Sentai discontinued the first Blu-Ray. Which means, that yo have no choice but to pay $80 for this amateur, cringy dub.

8675431,4,B00MZ3X9O4,"This review is for love, chunibyo and other delusions: rikka version, and for some reason, this review may be put into the season 1 reviews so I wanted to specify.

This movie is effectively a poorly done clipshow. There is about 20-25 minutes of new footage but for it being a RIKKA VERSION! there is nothing done in rikkas perspective, it's all still in yutas perspective(other than the 20-25 minutes of new stuff). Example: rikka is bringing yuta and kumin into toka's and her own apartment, but it does not show what's inside as rikka walks in, kumin mentions that rikka is a lady after the door closes with only rikka inside the apartment, and then it cuts to rikka sitting in a chair in her room saying ""welcome to the dark side."" Which is exactly what happened in season 1, almost to the letter in that scene.
It also does not accurately convey why Rikka is ""afflicted"" with chunibyo at all, and her father is not mentioned until the ""sayonara papa"" scene with yuta and rikka at the beach in the final season 1 non-ova episode, so for a first time viewer this would be a totally random reference.

It's fun, but I expected more unique non-clipshow based content, it's not bad at all, it's just a clipshow full of exposition.",1508630400,,1231,4.54054054054054

8675435,5,B00MZ3X9O4,"Absolutely loved this anime! It was enchanting and  hilarious! It drew me in on a level that a show hasn't in a long time. I was watching Trinity 7 with my other friend when I saw this playing on the other TV. I was told it was a romantic comedy and it's hilarious. I maintained a constant state of overtness. It was obvious that when I wasn't laughing I was about to. Rikka is adorable. My favorite anime character. She hides her sorrow and uses her delusions as a couping method. My favorite is how she can go from delusional and earnest in her delusions to sensitive and vulnerable around Yuta instantaneously. I liked how her delusive behavior matched her problems on an emotional level where as her friends are much more ebullient in their delusions. Rikka's overall tone and persona lives on through her imagination. Great character development.

When I compare it to other anime's I can honestly say it seems tamed. What I mean by that is in many anime's the characters always seem over zealous and over the top with expression and blow situations way out of proportion. I wonder once that maybe that was a way artists communicated how the characters where feeling since technology limits them to only a set number of facial expressions. A great example of this is during the scene in the second season envolving Yuta and Satone. However; this show was over the top in some instances because it was the punch line of their delusions.

Also I could relate to the characters. I feel like their problems were much more normal. This is defiantly a result of the show revolving around the real world and not a fantastic one.

By and large this anime is enchanting, adorable, awesome, and hilarious.

A Blu Ray format of season 2 including an English dubbed is being released later this year around December 19th. The DVD of season is englished dubbed for those who prefer that and want it sooner.",1472688000,,1898,4.636904761904762
