3650288,4,B001IYPO4O,"Edward G Robinson was a very funny comedian and at the height of his career at Warner Brothers, he made 3 farces which sent up in some way his image as a gangster. The best was the first, ""A Slight Case of Murder"" but ""Larceny Inc"" released in 1942 is not far behind.

Robinson plays an ex-con who buys a luggage shop next to a bank. Having failed to raise capital for a dog track by going in through the front door of the bank, he decides to enter into the back by drilling through into the vault via the cellar of the shop. This is a set up for a really funny farce as business in the luggage shop booms and Robinson becomes the hero of his neighbours. The film has a Damon Runyan feel and a great supporting cast led by the indispensible Ed Brophy as Robinson's sidekick, Jane Wyman as his very pretty step daughter, Broderick Crawford as a particularly dense thug and best of all, Jack Carson, as the Hotchkiss man, the prototype of every fast talking salesman. There are so many funny scenes, but Brophy (""It comes in 10 delicious colours"") and Robinson (""What do you expect for nine seventy five?"") are standouts when they make a sale.

The print of the film is excellent and there are a generous list of mediocre extras. The short film, directed by John Huston, was an Oscar nominee and neat recruitment propaganda. James Stewart, a decorated airman, narrates. The newsreel, without soundtrack, shows a base ball match at Sing Sing which ties in nicely with the film. The cartoons are typical Warner's fare with that touch of cynicism which made their  product so much better than the other studios' output.  An early Bugs Bunny appears in one.

The dud of the package is the dreadful commentary. Two erudite academics/historians, one from Harvard no less, analyse the film with absolutely no sense of humour. ""Larceny Inc"" is a rollicking farce, filled with cardboard 2 dimensional figures, filmed with no other purpose but to entertain and generate big box office. These absurd historians analyse the film as an example of changing American values, an insight into capitalism among other things. What a load of hogwash. Furthermore, there is no information about the wealth of marvellous character actors which fill the screen. These guys seriously need to get down off their pedestal.

The DVD is best value if purchased as part of the Warner Brother's Gangster Collection Volume 4.",1227916800,7,2392,4.7105263157894735

3650297,5,B001IYPO4O,"This sparkling crime-caper comedy, directed by Lloyd Bacon, was the inspiration for Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks."" Robinson, as J. Chalmers ""Pressure"" Maxwell, and Broderick Crawford, as his associate Jug Martin, bot career con artists, are about to be paroled from their latest term in the clink. They are met on the outside by the third member of their little gang, Weepy Davis (Edward Brophy). On the inside, Pressure had made the acquaintance of a hardened criminal, Leo (a very young Anthony Quinn), who, unlike Pressure and his associates, has no qualms about violence, whether with fists or with a gun, and hopes to enlist Pressure and Co. in his bid to knock over a bank in Midtown Manhattan. Pressure has promised his knowing stepdaughter Denny (the pre-Ronald Reagan, pre-""Falcon Crest"" Jane Wyman) that he is going straight- no more stock fraud scams, no more petty hustles and cheating the saps. But of course Pressure has just one more scam up his sleeve. Soon (through ill-gotten gains) he is running a luggage store adjacent to the bank Leo (still in prison) is eyeing. Pressure and his friends plan to follow through with the scheme, but months pass, and luggage business becomes (unexpectedly) legitimately successful, its proprietors become respected members of the local business community, and the break-into-the-bank-vault scheme is forgotten and abandoned. Except by the ruthless Leo, that is, who soon escapes from prison and is willing, by any means, to force his more-reluctant ex-con acquaintances to go through with the plan. Grant Mitchell is on hand in one of his trademark staid-bourgeois roles, and Jack Carson is entertaining as a traveling salesman with a hankering for Denny, Pressure's stepdaughter. Robinson for his part is superb, and for those interested in his comedic send-ups of his own tough-guy/gangster personal, I highly recommend ""The Whole Town's Talking"" from 1935, opposite Jean Arthur (not to be confused with ""The Talk of the Town,"" also from 1942, and also featuring Jean Arthur).",1419379200,3,2036,5.191489361702128

3650304,5,B001IYPO4O,"This is a fast-paced, immensely funny lesson in how NOT to rob a bank. Mobster Edward G. Robinson and his sidekicks take over a luggage store conveniently situated next to a bank. Merry mayhem ensues as they start digging. This has some of the anarchic energy of a Marx Brothers film but with more of a discernible plot.

The material was adapted from a Laura and S. J. Perelman play. It centers on that loveable sidekick relationship. In this case, Robinson has two sidekicks at his disposal. He has Broderick Crawford who plays ""Lug,"" well before that actor came into his own as a boss-man figure in movies. Then there's the perennially embonpoint Edward Brophy who plays the somewhat more dignified, but still diligently obedient character of ""Weepy.""

This movie comes from an era in which every leading man seemed capable of finding at least one other man willing to subordinate himself to any madcap plan the boss-man hatched. Whatever happened to such amenable souls? The availability of such partners willing to help you with heist and home is a big part of the appeal of these films. We might all wish we had such helpmates who were without any busyness of their own, so they could lend themselves wholeheartedly to our schemes.

There are a couple of moments when Robinson's treatment of his sidekicks becomes almost too overbearing and cruel. Then Anthony Quinn's unregenerate character of ""Lou"" casts a dark shadow over the proceedings. But the movie generally manages to recover and keep its light-hearted, humorous tone.

The actors get away with taking some liberties that were rare for 1942. Broderick Crawford's character gives the finger (watch for it), and Edward G. Robinson's character engages in some clever double entendre. The film commentators wonder how this got past the censors.

Those commentators are film historians Haden Guest and Dana Polan. At first I thought they were ruining the fun by over-interpreting the action and by weighting the characters with too much subliminal message. For example, Guest and Polan felt that Robinson was representing conversion to the capitalist spirit, that he was a propagandist for the American way of life. They saw a certain cynicism about America imbedded in this, as when the neighborhood is shown being in need of a strong man leader to galvanize them into success, and when everyone flocks around like consumer sheep in response to the sales campaigns that Jack Carson's character mounts on behalf of the luggage store.

The commentators also occasionally seem to get highfalutin in a way that's completely against the spirit of this simple film. They refer to the bank that Robinson first tries to borrow money from as being ""panoptical"" - referring to the surround surveillance of the panopticon, an institutional arrangement whose purposes were elaborated on by French philosopher Michel Foucault.

Still, their literate commentary eventually won me over. It left me with an expanded vocabulary for thinking about and discussing all sorts of entertainment forms, from vaudeville and the bedroom farce, to the presumed uplift of movies such as ""It's a Wonderful Life.""

There are also two entertaining cartoons from 1942 included as bonus material here - one featuring Porky Pig, the other featuring Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny. Both include clever sight gags and twist endings.

Finally, there's the very interesting extra featuring Jimmie Stewart acting as a recruitment officer for the Air force. Like all recruitment officers, Stewart doesn't let the young men viewing this film short consider any of the downsides to enlistment. Stewart only mentions the good pay, the prestige, the team spirit, and the attention of pretty young women, that the men will enjoy if they sign up. Seen from the perspective of the casualties suffered in any war, this pitch carries both pathos and patriotism.

There's a lot on this disc. It will take you back to the world of 1942 in so many ways. It's well worth the price.",1369353600,2,3985,5.042553191489362

3650308,4,B001IYPO4O,"We have some excellent reviews providing the substance of the film and the place it takes in Edward G. Robinson's body of work. He was one of those stage performers brought to Hollywood when 'the movies learned to talk' to provide actors who could make an impact with their voices as well as with their gestures. In the dramatic line, guys like Cagney and Robinson, provided the urban tough guy, Montgomery, Douglas, Fairbanks, Jr. (whose Dad showed a voice trained on the stage) helped on the light comedy side, and so with the range of needed voice types as many (but far from all) non-stage trained performers, proved unsuitable for the new screen. At various times, these serious guys were given a chance to play against type and do comedy. One such was Edward G. Robinson, who went to his friends Jack Benny and George Burns when he needed to do stand-up comedy for the troops during the War, but, being classically trained to do anything demanded on stage, fell easily into screen comedy. My favorites are ""A Slight Touch of Murder"" and ""Brother Orchid"", but I have enjoyed this one since I saw it when it was first released and we paid 11 cents to get into the movie house. Robinson as the fast-talking grifter, with no ability nor taste for violence, leads the cast which includes other Warner Brothers contract players, chiefly Ed Brody, Broderick Crawford (son of a quite successful actress), Jane Wyman and Jack Carson. It is a light farce with no social significance but a lot of fun. How it will go with younger audiences I can't say, but those who grew up with ""Little Caesar"" should find it entertaining.",1349136000,,1619,4.684210526315789
3650309,4,B001IYPO4O,"I've always enjoyed Edward G. Robinson's comedic roles over his drama based performances. Like Jimmy Cagney, there's a real sense of achievement underneath their characters since you could see the supreme effort it took to overcome their height disadvantage - especially in the world of entertainment. Short people so very rarely make to the top, so to speak.

In this funny film he plays 'Pressure' Maxwell, a criminal who has finally had enough of the underworld. He's going straight. Even though he's well thought of by his fellow crooks, to the point of refusing an invitation to a plum of a bank job, he's got it in him to finally go the straight-n-narrow. Not just for himself, but for his little girl, Denny, played by a young Jane Wyman. He wants to make her proud by doing right; promising her that his final stint in Sing-Sing prison was his final stint period.

But fate has it that everything he tries to make good falls apart. In order to fulfill his promise, he's left with only one option: Take down the bank job he initially refused in the joint. End justifying the means. So in that effort he buys out the near-bankrupt leather goods business located next to the bank, and more specifically, gaining access to the cellar adjacent to the vault.

Suddenly, a trickle of customers start to patron the business. Pressure's attempts to placate and discard potential customers by underselling products, and even giving away inventory, inadvertently starts a word-of-mouth campaign. Coupled with Denny's surreptitious advertising efforts, and the trickle quickly turns into a deluge. His fake business is suddenly a runaway success and even neighboring businesses are barging in looking to him for help, leadership, and inspiration.

Unbelievably, success and achievement are now his enemies. Can he beat back prosperity in order to carry out his crime?

Enjoyable flick from 1942 that still has the energy to entertain.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor Criticism: Not of the movie at all.

But in stupidly selecting to engage the DVD Commentary, I found myself fighting off a migraine. Two film historians, one from Harvard, the other from another school, were chosen to add their thoughts and insights to the production.

And it's the Harvard professor that confirms my position that some intellectuals tend to inflate in order to fill space, both mental and literal, substituting b.s. for actual content.

In the commentary he notes that the director intentionally differentiated the characters by use of ""uniforms"" - that the clothes were deeply symbolic of the social caste system of the day, revealing the gap between the haves and have nots. Well duh. Would it make sense if a cab driver were dressed as a Roman Centurion? A bank manager as a rodeo clown? Last I checked - this wasn't a Dali film.

Talk about blabbering blatherskite. Pure rubbish intended to validate the degree posted on his wall.

The director and costume designer needed the characters to fit the story - period. There's NO greater social significance being imparted. Complete shibai as we say here in the islands. God, save us from the academic intelligentsia and their desperate need to validate.

The owner wants a thousand dollars to sell the shop, so Pressure pushes Broderick Crawford (Jug) in front of a flashy car for a quick out of court settlement. From here on it is all downhill roaring funny. Jug starts digging down and over to the bank vault, Pressure and Weepy (Edward Brophy) man the store with daughter played by Jane Wyman, and the fast talking, gabbing, traveling valise salesman (Jack Carson) talks the trio into credit buying more trunks that fit in the store. The trunks are used to haul the dirt out, Jack Carson falls in love with Pressure's daughter and an old sour con (Anthony Quinn) breaks out of Sing Sing and wants in on the action.

Albeit, the store becomes profitable and Pressure a neighborhood hero.",1332806400,,999,4.575418994413408

SPOILERS FOLLOW!
The action in ""Larceny"" peaks on Christmas Eve.

Burglary plans have been abandoned in favor of booming buisness. Fellow ex-Sing Sing inmate Anthony Quinn muscles in on the defunct heist scheme, so Edw. G. Robinson hopes to sell his thriving luggage shop back to its original elderly owner and then ""scram."" He posts burly Broderick Crawford in a Santa Claus suit outside the closed store to watch for Quinn while the transfer is completed. Crawford tries alerting Robbie that Quinn has arrived but is floored with a haymaker from Elmer Fudd himself, AQ Bryan. At the point of a pistol, Quinn sends Robinson outside in the Santa outfit. The ill-fitting costume looks almost as ridiculous as the smoldering cigar stub in Robbie's mouth.

Robbie invites strolling carolers in and they serenade while Quinn fumes. They're shown the door after collecting a few dollars. When the new/old owner insists on reopening his store, Quinn knocks him to the floor. Robbie comes to the injured man's aid and is also rendered unconscious by Quinn's pistol butt. Right after TNT is set off in the basement, the storeowner hits a burglar alarm and passes out. Quinn and cohorts make a quick exit, leaving the two victims in a burning luggage shop....

3650312,5,B001IYPO4O,"I stumbled upon this largely forgotten 1942 comedy earlier today. It turns out that it was a very good movie, up there with any feature length comedy of that era. Eddie G Robinson, Broderick Crawford, and Ed Brophy were great together and showed a lot of chemistry. It left me wishing they had done more films together, but I think this is the only one all three did together. Jackie Gleason is nearly unrecognizable in an early role as a soda jerk. If I didn't read ahead of time that it was Gleason, I'm not sure I would have made the connection. Who would have guessed in 1942 that Gleason would ultimately have the greatest legacy of anyone in this film? Jane Wyman, Jack Carson, and Harry Davenport round out the great supporting cast.

The plot almost seems like something that came out of a Three Stooges short. Three ex-cons look to buy a dog track, but can't finance it, so they buy a luggage store next door to the bank and hope to build a tunnel from the store to the bank vault.

Directed by Lloyd Bacon

As usual Eddie G steals the show -- This very well might be my favorite Edward G. Robinson picture. I have yet to see him in a bad performance. It concerns three rather dimwitted criminals who come up with a plan to rob a bank by tunneling in through the basement of the luggage shop next door. Robinson is the boss and he is supported by even more dimwitted Eddie Brophy and Broderick Crawford. This little gem of a story just builds and builds. Everything goes haywire when Anthony Quinn shows up and throws a monkey wrench into the whole works and the ""gang"" have to go reluctantly on the up and up. Jack Carson, as usual, plays a bumbling but earnest character, much as his cop ""playwright"" wonderful performance in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944).

They just don't make 'em like this anymore!

Robinson's adopted daughter is Jane Wyman and her beau is salesman Jack Carson. Wyman was also a few years from an Oscar for ""Johnny Belinda"" and Carson did break the mold of playing lovable blow hards.

Fast-paced comedy with the kind of ""crackling"" dialogue they don't write anymore. Robinson is a scream in the lead, and his supporting cast equals him.  Here, the great Edward G. Robinson makes fun of his bad guy roles, like he will do a few years later in ""Brother Orchid"".

3650314,5,B001IYPO4O,"At long last! I finally found this movie for sale via Amazon and immediately ordered it. It's a treat to go back to the 'good old days' when movies like this were shown on the local Late Show which usually came on at 11:15 PM. I remember the Late Show's musical theme song Leroy Anderson's ""The Syncopated Clock"". As with the Boston TV stations in my neck of the woods, this seemed to be the format Late Shows around the country would use.

While we are getting spoiled by digital remastering techniques, I'm glad that movies of this vintage remain grainy and with less than optimal sound. It adds to the nostalgic value of the movie when that was the best quality the times offered. As well, IMHO today's 'comedy' can't hold a candle to those thrilling days of yesteryear (RIP Fred Foy)when artists like Edward G put on virtuoso performances without getting into 'in detail' sexual situations and the use of fowl language. Some of the language that movies out today use are enough to even make this ex Navy sailor (Moi) blush.

He soon discovers a luggage store on a street under heavy construction that sits right next to a bank.  When he finds the owner Homer Bigelow (Harry Davenport) is anxious to sell, he seizes upon the opportunity, the idea being that the construction will drown out the noise of their drilling through the basement floor into the bank vault.  Together with his two cohorts, Jug (Broderick Crawford) and Weepy (Edward Brophy), they take over the establishment.  But, the three prove to be inept, bumbling crooks.
