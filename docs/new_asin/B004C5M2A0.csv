8422794,5,B004C5M2A0,"The Amazon commentator who claims to have seen this production of The Passenger in Houston appears to have posted his or her comments out of a fit of visceral hatred for the piece itself. The cast of singers that performed Weinbergs opera at the Bergenzer Festspiele (with the notable exceptions of Michelle Breedt and Agnieszka Rehlis) did not perform in Texas last Saturday, January 18. Its also my understanding that the Houston production was sung in English, whereas this video-graphed production is sung in German, Russian, English and Polish. Shostakovich, whose bathwater is witlessly referenced, thought very highly of this work. I encourage anyone interested in it to read Alex Rosss very intelligent commentary which can be found on his easily searchable The Rest is Noise blog.

One paragraph in the Ross essay describes an especially powerful moment, a scene that moved me to tears. Ross writes, In Weinbergs opera, which has a libretto by the music critic Alexander Medvedev, the concert [in Auschwitz] becomes a gesture of resistance: Tadeusz, Martas fianc, is supposed to play the commandants favorite waltz, but instead launches into Bachs Chaconne in D Minor, with the orchestra bashing out dissonant chords behind him Weinberg handles it with masterly detachment, letting Bach sing out purely and then effectively shutting the music down, as if the notes were sticking in the air. Shostakovich, in an essay on the opera, declared that the tragic strength of this scene can barely be described in words.

In any case, those seeking information about the product being sold here, must disregard the views of somebody who has not purchased and seen the video. It is technically first rate, with superb sound, and the video image editing is especially accomplished. I use very high-end equipment for sound and picture.

I had purchased this Blu-ray many weeks ago, but I didn't watch it until the same night that the opera was being presented in Houston. I found it immensely powerful, emotionally devastating, even grueling. I do not know what many hard-core musical modernists may think of it. I gather there were some negative reviews when it was shown at the ENO in London  and as I write, I am still awaiting an intelligent report from a Texas (or any) newspaper. When it was presented at the ENO, critic Norman Lebrecht loved it and, I think, called it a major near-masterpiece, what critics like to say when they are afraid of sticking their necks out too far. Advocating for marginalized 20th-century or new music is always dangerous to ones reputation. But I think Lebrecht continues to back this one fairly strongly.

Maybe some listeners do not like the music's almost unrelenting emotional intensity. Some people may wish the opera were atonal or serial or something really progressive, but its not. It is very much its own style, but Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten and Kurt Weill all seem to have some influence on it. Its certainly not harmonically unsophisticated. Much wonderful folk song material is employed to great effect in the Auschwitz concentration camp scenes, more than half of the opera.

The aforementioned scene that Ross cites will always stick with me. One of the characters is a brilliant violinist, Tadeusz, who is sentenced to die in a gas chamber-oven contraption, but before he is marched to the place of execution, he is summoned before a bunch of uniformed SS types who demand to hear the Commandants favorite waltz, a tacky composition that composer Weinberg has introduced earlier in the score (over the camps loudspeakers!) and uses several times to tremendous melodramatic effect in the opera. There is a silence and we wait for Tadeusz to play the tacky waltz. Instead, with his back to the audience, he launches into the great D-minor Chaconne from Bachs second violin partita. The music is played straight for many measures  and then the orchestra picks up the Bach music, distorting in a most menacing way. The Nazis, enraged by hearing the Bach instead of the tacky waltz, set upon Tadeusz and beat him to death with their fists and whatever is lying around. The contrast between one of the most cultivated and profound pieces of German art and this brutal behavior is, admittedly, over the top  but not implausible.

I have to say, I think Humperdincks Hnsel und Gretel is a charming opera. But the man or woman who compares the ovens of Auschwitz to the ovens of the witchs gingerbread cottage shows an astounding insensitivity.",1390176000,4,4492,5.002677376171352
8422795,5,B004C5M2A0,"This is an amazing opera by this completely ignored and extremely talented Jewish composer of Polish origin, who was un-lucky twice- to be born in Poland and then to live in USSR. The propoganda of USSR did achieved great results- even many current  musicians  do not know his name. He was a close friend of Shostakovich. Shostakovich wrote a letter fo Beria, when Weinberg was taken to prison along with others during horrible  Stalin's ""Doctor's Plot""  ITs worth knowing.
The music of the opera, the content and its production - everything is excellent and outstanding. You will not regret if you watch this opera.",1355616000,5,616,4.894230769230769
8422796,5,B004C5M2A0,"If you love theater and you love music you will be captivated by this opera and the innovative Bregenz production. The casting, sets and costumes are amazing, the vocal performances stellar and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra impeccable! The story about a former female Auschwitz SS guard who thinks she recognizes one of her prisoners now several years after WWII on a pleasure cruise from Germany to Berlin makes for great drama. Composer Miecyslaw Weinberg creates stunning and poignant arias of concentration camps' inmates final hours contrasted with drama that probes the troubled psychological state of the former guard. This opera is unforgettable and after making this DVD purchase, I hope to see it live one day!",1317168000,13,724,5.25
8422797,5,B004C5M2A0,"Is an opera dealing with Auschwitz automatically worthy of acclaim simply through its dealing with a subject that can't help but be powerful and emotive? Or are some subjects are just so taboo that they shouldn't be turned into art, since any attempts to do so will almost certainly diminish them? The approach to Schindler's List, for example, with its theatricality, its glossy, immaculately-lit and carefully composed cinematography, is certainly questionable, as is the means through which Spielberg chooses to approach the Holocaust, but surely even dealing with the subject and bringing awareness to a wider younger audience has its merit? Written in 1967-8, it's taken over 40 years for Mieczyslaw Weinberg's opera The Passenger to receive its World Premiere at the Bregenzer Festspiele in 2010, and on the basis of this remarkable production, it seems that opera is the perfect and perhaps the only art-form really capable of dealing with the complex questions that the subject gives rise to.

Dealing with events that took place in Auschwitz from the perspective of looking back on what happened, those questions relate here to the issues of guilt and conscience, specifically over the involvement and culpability of ordinary German people in the atrocities committed during the war in the Nazi concentration camps. The subject is raised as a German official, Walter, is about to set sail with his wife to take up a diplomatic post in Brazil during the 1960s. His wife, Lisa, becomes upset however when she sees a passenger on the ship, a woman who reminds her of a dark episode in her past that she has never told her husband about. The woman reminds her of Marta, a Polish prisoner at Auschwitz, where Lisa was an SS camp overseer.

This is an extraordinary subject to make an opera about, and, as you would expect, it's treated with the utmost seriousness and gravity and has the potential to be deeply upsetting, the imagery and the setting taking on further significance through its performance in Austria, close to where similar events took place in the past. More than just dealing with the subject in a grim manner - which is easy enough to do through the dramatic situation alone - Weinberg's The Passenger brings an incredibly more powerful dimension to the subject by making everyone, Nazis and Jews alike, sing. The power of the singing voice can be taken for granted in an opera, but rarely has it been aligned to a subject that is so emotive in its own right, and it serves to intensify both the evil pronouncements of the Nazi camp attendants as well as the laments of the prisoners. But it also has relevance to the story - yes, even in Auschwitz, music was played, and the image this evokes is truly pitiable.

The libretto by Alexander Medvedev, based on a novel by camp survivor Zofia Posmysz (the only one of original writer involved in the opera still alive and present at this performance), manages to evoke these deep and dark sentiments through disturbing poetic imagery (included in full in an accompanying booklet and well worth reading on its own) of the ""Pitch black wall of death, the last thing you saw before oblivion"". That brings to mind the ""huge black wave"" of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and the influence of Shostakovich is evident also in the music.  Weinberg's extraordinary arrangements include jazz, swing music, waltz and simple theatrical accompaniments but it also has folk laments and dark jabs of strings, woodwind and percussion that underscore emotions of a kind that are rarely, if ever, dealt with in opera. Libretto and score combine then to get to the heart of the subject in the most direct and powerful manner, questioning the attempt of Lisa and Walter to wipe away the memory of the past and move on with their lives, comparing it to the Nazi's looking for an easy solution to dispose of 20,000 bodies a day. It's this practical nature that seems to dominate over guilt and conscience and over any deeper consideration of what those actions mean.

The staging at Bregenz is remarkably effective, with incredible multi-level set designs that keep the action fluid, retaining the connection between past and present, the ship above the concentration camp below - an arrangement that culminates in Lisa's spectacular metaphorical descent into hell. It's the genius of the opera also that it primarily considers the subject from the viewpoint of Lisa, a former SS Overseer in Auschwitz. It takes in not just those who suffered and died at the hands of the Nazis, but also necessarily takes into account the people who carried out the atrocities, and tries to consider how they can live with themselves afterwards. Forgiving and forgetting, however, is not an option.

The video quality of the Blu-ray release is superb - possibly the best I've seen in High Definition - the whites and creams of the ship scenes contrasted with the sepia tones in the Auschwitz scenes, which show remarkable detail for being so dark.  The audio is not perfect on account of it being a live performance and with the difficulties of setting up microphones.  The music booms and is a little echoing in places, occasionally overwhelming the singing, but more often it's clear enough to hear the detail and the color.  There is only one track, DTS HD Master-Audio 5.0, which is centrally focussed, but it downmixes to stereo quite well for those with only a 2-speaker option.  Subtitles are in German, English, French, Polish and Russian, with an additional Multilingual option for the libretto which uses several languages.  A superb half-hour documentary 'In der Fremde' covers the background of Weinberg and the history of the opera, including an interview with Zofia Posmysz.",1299024000,34,5713,4.9344432882414155
