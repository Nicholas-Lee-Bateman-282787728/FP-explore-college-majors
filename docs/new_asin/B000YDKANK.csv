8232099,3,B000YDKANK,"""Seven Magnificent Guns"" director Romolo Guerrieri helmed ""Johnny
Yuma,"" an above-average but uneven spaghetti western with Mark Damon,
Rosalba Neri, and Lawrence Dobkin, in the mid-1960s when Italian
westerns were just hitting their stride. Indeed, ""Johnny Yuma"" came out
before Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" reached
theaters. This gritty, sun-drenched, shoot'em up set in the arid
Southwest imitates traditional American oaters while embracing its
foreign origins and influences. Like a traditional Hollywood western
from the 1950s, Guerrieri's sagebrusher boasts a title credits ballad.
Mark Damon makes a serviceable hero, but he isn't cast in the mold of
the monosyllabic bounty hunter. He is more of a 1950's American western
hero. Meanwhile, ""Johnny Yuma"" delivers a high body count and generates
a reasonable amount of excitement in its simple, straightforward, but
often brutal saga. The gang of trigger-happy ruffians led by a scheming
wife resolve to eliminate the heir to a fortune. Guerrieri and
co-scenarist Fernando Di Leo of ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" along with
Sauro Scavolini and Giovanni Simonelli of ""Any Gun Can Play,"" have
contrived a largely predictable western about betrayal, murder, and
revenge. The surprises aren't plentiful, but this violent opus doesn't
dawdle. The gorgeous scenery around Almeria, Spain, where ""Johnny Yuma""
was lensed by ""Gunmen of the Rio Grande"" cinematographer Mario
Capriotti, serves a metaphor for life and death. Capriotti makes you
feel the heat, the sweat, and the flies. The Mill Creek version of ""Johnny Yuma"" contains the film in its 2.35.1 widescreen format for purists to appreciate. Guerrieri and Capriotti like
to indulge themselves with pans that rotate 360 degrees, whether they
are surveying the rugged scenery or a players in a poker game. Despite
its reliance on dramatic gimmicks, Guerrieri and his writers
occasionally allow reality to intrude into the plot. Principally, they
stress that the west of ""Johnny Yuma"" is a place where you can suffer
death just as fatally from a gun barrel as from lack of water.

The eponymous hero of ""Johnny Yuma"" is an accurate, young,
swift-on-the-draw gunslinger who blasted his way to fame in Yuma with
his six-gun. Johnny's uncle, wealthy land owner Thomas Felton (Leslie
Daniels of ""Paisan""), has decided to leave everything that he owns to
the pistol-packing protagonist, Johnny Yuma, because the latter is more
suited to running a ranch than anybody on his wife's side of the
family. We are told that Felton and his wife didn't have children. Of
course, Felton's beautiful but treacherous wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri
of ""Lady Frankenstein"") has tried without success to convince her
cigar-smoking, wheel-chair bound husband to entrust everything to Pedro
(Luigi Vannucchito of ""The Red Tent""), her low-down brother. As it
turns out, Pedro shows up to shoot Felton in cold blood at point blank
range while Felton is practicing his marksmanship with black powder
arms. The wife dispatches a Mexican servant, Luis 'Sancho' Fernandez,
to take a letter to an ex-lover, Linus Jerome Carradine (Lawrence
Dobkin of ""Patton""), to kill the servant. The villains have done a
shrewd job of implicating poor Sancho in the death of Felton. The
remainder of the action is spent showing our hero dodge endless bullets
while dropping his adversaries dead in their tracks without more than a
single shot. Our hero's avowed enemy, Carradine, changes side, and they
are virtually indestructible together in a gunfight. During an early
saloon brawl scene, Carradine and Yuma meet and swap out gun belts.
Yuma carries his Colt's revolver on his left hip, while Carradine wears
his on his right hip. Carradine has a gun belt that allows him to
detach the holster without having to wait for his six-gun to clear the
leather. When Johnny shows up in San Marco, everybody initially
mistakes him for Carradine because he is wearing Carradine's gun belt
with the initials LJC on it.

Although ""Johnny Yuma"" remains dramatic for the most part, this uneven
western takes time out for optional humor that appears out of place.
More often than not, the action is pretty heavy-handed rather than
light0footed. Poor Mexican farmers bit the dust just to show how vile
the villains are, and one of these hellions kills a innocent little
boy. Indeed, the villains in ""Johnny Yuma"" emerge as incredible
dastards. In one scene, these unsavory thugs rough up our hero, giving
him a real beating along the lines of ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" but they
don't beat Johnny so horribly that he can only crawl afterward.
Eventually, our youthful hero Johnny teams up with an older, wiser
hombre,Carradine in a standard-issue Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid
relationship where an older man trains a younger man. They have done
everything to make Carradine look like Lee Van Cleef's Mortimer from
""For A Few Dollars More,"" right down to his suitcase that accommodates
his six-gun. Questionable comic relief is provided by a goofy Mexican
peasant who constitutes an outrageous stereotype. ""Vengeance is Mine""
composer Nora Orlandi provides a charismatic orchestral soundtrack that
enhances the mood of this melodrama.",1302134400,,5191,5.208133971291866
8232100,3,B000YDKANK,"If it weren't for the incomparable Rosalba Neri, this movie would be a total stinker (one star). She's great as always in this movie, playing a villainess (note: she stays fully clothed in this one you pervs, go watch Amuck! or Lady Frankenstein if this is a problem for you). She alone is the reason I give this movie three stars. I'm not a fan at all of Mark Damon as the lead in a western, but whatever, this may or may not be a problem for most. I'm just saying this would've been a way better movie with Lee Van Cleef or someone in the lead male role. The theme song is either annoying or hilarious depending on your personality.

This DVD package is nothing special. No real special features, fullscreen presentation. I actually recomend the version that is included in the ultra-common 20 movie Spaghetti Western pack from Mill Creek Entertainment because at least the version included in this package is widescreen.",1254700800,7,923,4.628048780487805
