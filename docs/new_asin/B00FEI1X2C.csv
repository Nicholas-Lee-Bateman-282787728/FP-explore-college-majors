5980475,5,B00FEI1X2C,"I just watched this video on a drummer-oriented website, and immediately ordered it from Amazon.  So I have kind of a single focus for this video at the moment, i.e. I bought it to watch Tony Williams.  This was the period (1972) when I'd just started getting into Tony Williams' Lifetime; but by then Tony had started playing in other people's groups besides his own (record company/music biz burnout, I think).  There aren't many videos of him playing with Lifetime but his drumming on this video has the vitality of his Lifetime work, even if the musical setting's a lot different.  I've watched his solo on this video over and over on the other website, and his performance throughout is always tasteful, musical, energetic, and inimitable.

And the rest of the band aren't exactly slouches, either.  Great video all-around, highly recommended.",1401840000,2,848,4.9787234042553195
5980476,5,B00FEI1X2C,"Stan Getz, like many of the founding fathers, had a long and winding road to get to where they got. Of course, he had a few of the great ones that proceeded him to follow. But like his kind they were always searching for something new. On this concert in 1972, he is in his prime. This is in color and is top notch video for the time. He has an all star band and he feeds off of them. Stan sets his horn on fire in a way I've never heard before. This is a departure from videos like The Last Recording. Don't get me wrong, that one is a must have. I have always thought of him as a great balladeer. On this this one, he sounds like he's heading for the stars. on a couple
of tunes. This is a must have for quality video of Stan in earlier years, in color.",1401840000,4,755,3.8774193548387097
5980477,5,B00FEI1X2C,"Five ICONIC Stars! The DVD captures the legendary Hall of Fame tenor sax titan Stan Getz in 1972 during his first of many appearances over the years at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, with as heavyweight a rhythm section as imaginable, all leaders of their own historic groups, all innovators, and as of 2014, three are in the DownBeat Hall of Fame with the remaining one a strong possibility: master keyboardist Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke on double bass plucking and fingering at times like a pianist, and the always dynamic Tony Williams on drums dropping bombs, snare figurations, rim shots, and cymbal splashes. These relaxed-intensity performances are absolutely outstanding and the four play like old friends, blending and soloing magnificently with great imagination and empathy. Indeed, all had played on the Getz album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Marvel/dp/B0012GMZ3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Marvel</a>"" which features most of this particular set's songs. This was the first of five Corea compositions played that day at Montreux and on ""Captain Marvel"" Getz is in splendid improvisational form taking the song for a delightful uptempo ride with hairpin twists and turns, giving way to a wonderful Corea solo, with Williams and Clarke pushing Getz ever onward to the end. Always the consummate lyrical balladeer, Getz and the group treat the crowd to marvelous versions of Billy Strayhorn's ""Lush Life"", Benny Golson's ""I Remember Clifford"" (Clarke's big sound and Williams' sensitive support are awesome), and a beautiful version of another Corea favorite ""Windows"". Corea's ""La Fiesta"" starts with Clarke's complex ostinati figurations and has the best solos by Getz (especially an upward spiraling section), Corea, and a monster drum solo by Williams over Corea's staccato comping. Outstanding musicianship, great camera work, and a pristine soundscape make this DVD a keeper for the collection. Executive producer is another iconic legend, longtime festival founder and producer, Claude Nobs.

8614853,5,B00FEI1X2C,Oh man this DVD RULES and in two years Eagle Rock deletes from their catalog. I bought it new here for 7 dollars... Yes 7 dollars and anything less than 5 stars your crazy... Stanley Chick and TONY in color... And Getz I mean how can you go wrong. Sound picture awesome it's 1972 for Christ Sakes and it's from the MASTER TAPE. So it's in mono again it's 1972... I wanna know where is Lifetime footage. I seen the 1971 Montreux on You Tube looks pretty nasty but if they released that WOW and... Man where is the Lifetime footage from 1969 and 1970 that's the major holy grail... Where is it....  They had to be video taped...,1443398400,2,626,4.260504201680672

8614860,4,B00FEI1X2C,"This well-produced DVD captures an interesting period in Getz's career. He was experimenting with a new direction--the ""freer"" jazz of the young players like Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Tony Williams who form the rhythm section. They all perform at a high level and Getz shows he is capable of playing ""inside"" or ""outside"" with equal technique and proficiency. Stan was one of the all-time greats and his virtuosity and musicianship in a different context (for him) are on display at this concert.",1428969600,,502,5.0602409638554215
