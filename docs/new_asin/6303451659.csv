7850313,4,6303451659,"This Is America, Charlie Brown cartoons were very innovative specials that featured the Peanuts characters in important moments in history, and gave kids (as well as parents) a fun insight on how certain historical characters (and their influences) came to be. This episode is about the how the Constitution was created, as well as how the legislative, executive and judicial branches affected the delegates. The special mainly revolved around Linus and Peppermint Patty, but the other usual characters were there as well (although as usual, Schroeder appeared out of nowhere, was only in one scene, and didn't have any lines).

I knocked off a star because the idea of Charlie Brown inventing all those sports, like basketball and baseball (""I bet hitting a ball with a stick would make a GREAT game!""), was a little too surreal. But it's all right because the special is still great. These This Is America specials rarely come on television any more, so if you want to see them, click the ADD TO CART button.

7850314,4,6303451659,"In Volume 6 of This Is America, Charlie Brown (The Birth of the Constitution), the Peanuts gang are asked to help out while our Founding Fathers discuss the Constitution in 1788.  Charlie Brown helps with valet parking (saddling up horses) and experiments with some new games, Snoopy is the guard-dog, Peppermint Patty and Marcie serve water, Linus is the greeter, and Lucy is in charge of cleanup (and of course, complains about it!).  Questions abound: should the new country have more governmental power or less?  Lucy thinks the solution is to have a queen!  Benjamin Franklin stops by Charlie Brown's house to borrow one of his kites for his latest experiment!  Snoopy and Woodstock clown around with colonial wigs and try rowing a sinking boat (with Snoopy posing as General George Washington!).  This video features a lovely soundtrack by George Winston (known for his Windham Hill collections), who plays Vince Guaraldi's original standards on both piano and harpsicord.",1017705600,5,978,5.158227848101266
