8426605,3,B004EBB3CK,"This DVD opens with the instructor saying that she will teach you how to play Mahjong.  Unfortunately that is a misnomer, for you will be taught the American variant of Mahjong only.  The American variant has some distinct differences from the game as played around the world.  International Mahjong tournaments and World Mahjong Championships do not play American rules mahjong, and is played by both men and women.  American Mahjong is played predominantly with women.

I am at a lost to understand how the Americans who played Mahjong in the 20-30's developed the opening move called  ""The Charleston"", however, this DVD will help you understand how this move is played.  The plus in this DVD is showing how the American variant of Mahjong is played with two actual games.  This is not a professionally produced DVD, but is more than sufficient to show you the basic American rules set by the Jewish ladies of the National Mahjongg League in New York, NY",1393459200,,957,4.864197530864198
8426606,3,B004EBB3CK,"This is a pretty good DVD of a slightly better than home studio produced product level. It covers the set, tile trading or 'Charleston', rules, and some play.

However, this is for the American Rules play only, using the National Mah Jongg League (NML) score cards, where only the hands on that card are viable.",1324512000,3,311,4.654545454545454

I prefer Learn Mahjong With Susie, it is more professional and simpler to follow. The only plus of this one was that it shows an extra model game",1294790400,3,415,6.849056603773585
8426608,1,B004EBB3CK,"After seeing the comments on How To Play Mahjong With Susie I came here expecting a major find.

Sadly, I suspect that since it is the same reviews here and there, something smells fishy.

My grandmother used to say, ""The Fish Stinks From The Mouth.""

These reviews seem planted and not from genuine users of the product.

Saying a DVD is better because it is longer is like saying Lincoln's Gettysburg Address stinks because it was too short.

Frankly, I was disappointed.

Mahjong For Beginners is one of those copycat products just pushed out to market because someone else thought of it first.

Just sayin.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Mahjongg-With-Susie/dp/B003TCSG66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn Mahjongg With Susie</a>&nbsp;is a better choice.",1292284800,7,807,6.026315789473684

I won $17 last week at my friendly Mahjong game!!! This DVD was so easy to understand and the training for me as a complete beginner made me a pro in less than a week.  HIGHLY Recommend!!!",1291939200,11,332,4.015151515151516
