Whole move made of interviews of psychologists, philosophers, one quantum physicist. There is no graphic accompanying their thoughts or scientific facts. Persons sit and express their opinions. Nice background behind and music which take you down to the sleep. It's like hypnosis. So my wife took off first and I in 15 minutes or so. It's good to watch if you can't fall asleep. Really helpful.
On one hand they have some interesting thoughts in another one they talking of something in so blur manner of thought expression... I did not get for myself more then I already know.

For someone who looking for truth I'd recommend ""The Privileged Planet / Unlocking the Mystery of Life 2-DVD"".

I bought the whole series, all three DVDs and it is fascinating.  Anyone who wants to understand the revolution of science and spiritual understanding must get these DVDs!",1227916800,4,284,4.895833333333333
