3513639,5,B001CIOCRG,"I am very pleased with this product. I have been waiting a long time. I am very fortunate to have seen Tammy perform in 1993, but never had the chance to see any video or performances from the 1960's or 1970's. Her voice is incredible. I don't know of anyone who sang with so much honesty and heartbreak. You can feel it. My only complaint is that I want more.",1234483200,5,360,4.1571428571428575
3513640,5,B001CIOCRG,"I'm giving this DVD set a qualified five stars; it's a thrill to see all this vintage Tammy Wynette footage and certainly it is a ""must have"" for every Tammy fan but some of the footage is just not in particularly great shape. Of course, Tammy's singing is always on target.

1. Don't Come Home a Drinkin' - (1967) an extremely early TV appearance on the Stonemans show. Footage is near excellent.  It's wonderful to see Tammy this young and it makes one regret the other song she did on the show which is referred to is not seen!!

2 & 3. Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad & I Don't Wanna Play House (1967) from the Bill Anderson show.  Footage is near excellent.  Tammy is introduced with her first number by Bill and Jan Howard (the latter of whom makes a rather surprisingly blunt comment that most ""girls singers"" are ""not really"" fans of each other though she has some favorites, including Tammy).  Bill interviews Tammy briefly before her second number in which she is joined for harmony by her stepdaughter Donna Chapel.

4. D-I-V-O-R-C-E (1968) the CMA Awards.  The only black-and-white footage on the DVD (curious since surely by that late date this was broadcast in color) Tammy is introduced by hosts Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and launches into a sensational live version of this classic.  Alas, print quality is only good but worth including for her superb vocals.

5. STAND BY YOUR MAN (1969) Wilburn Brother show.  Excellent print.

6. REACH OUT YOUR HAND (1972) CMA Awards.  Near excellent.  Tammy sings an abbreviated version of the song - the DVD does not acknowledge it was part of a legendary number in CMA history where it's reigning queens Tammy, Loretta Lynn, Lynn Anderson, Dolly Parton, and Dottie West all sang their newest song and then got together for historic harmony singing Dottie's ""Country Girl"".  Very disappointing this complete melody isn't here, especially the finale!!

7 & 8. WE LOVED IT AWAY and WOMAN TO WOMAN (1974).  Pop Goes the Country.  Near excellent print.

9. TIL I CAN MAKE IT ON MY OWN. (1976) Johnny Cash and Friends.  Tammy is introduced by Cash. Flawless print.  This one came from the Johnny Cash estate and it's in perfect shape.

10-11-12. GOLDEN RING,  YOU AND ME, NEAR YOU.  Country Music Hit Parade. George & Tammy are introduced by Jimmy Dean for these songs.  I don't remember this show, the DVD info says it was a NBC special but since it's done in a ""this week's top ten"" format it appears to be perhaps ashort-lived weekly syndicated program. Excellent print.

13-14. HE WAS THERE WHEN I NEEDED YOU and WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON.  The DVD calls this from ""NBC Tammy Wynette special"" in 1980 only Tammy never had a network special of her own. This print is only fair to good minus and frankly appears to be a copy of a video recording and one perhaps that they are unsure of name of the actual program.  These performances are also not sourced in the credits.  Worth seeing though to catch Tammy in a Farrah Fawcett hairdo.

15. COWBOYS DON'T SHOOT STRAIGHT LIKE THEY USED TO (1981) Country Comes Home special.  Excellent print with a bit of an interview before her song as she has her makeup applied.

The extra footage includes two interviews Tammy did in the 1980's (one done by Lee Greenwood), 1978 Nashville newscast footage of Tammy's wedding to George Richey which runs about five minutes, and Tammy's posthumous induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame - a shamefully late honor by the CMA.  This segment includes a Tammy hits melody sung by Lorrie Morgan and Pam Tillis and George Richey's taped acceptance speech (it's unknown if he didn't show up because he was still grieving or pissed at it's lateness, probably both like most Tammy Wynette fans.)

Now, let's get to the performances themselves.  Tammy's singing is outstanding with every song, her looks may change over the years but her dedication and sincerity never did and this DVD is a testament as to why she stood head and shoulders over virtually every other woman in the industry.  I am a bit disappointed there is no footage post-1982, Tammy's blockbuster hits may have ended but she was still having top 20 hits frequently right up to the end of the decade and of course she remained a popular major country star right up to her death in 1996 even if country radio had tuned her out like every other star of her era.  It would have been great to see her sing one of her three top 20 hits from 1988's ""Higher Ground"" album.  Since the CMA apparently had a hand in this compilation it's disappointing that the ""extra"" footage didn't include Tammy's acceptance speeches for her three wins as  Female Vocalist of the Year - that would have been sensational, especially for those of us too young to have seen it at the time.

It's hard to believe Tammy Wynette has been gone for 10 years now, she was always such an important and vital part of country music for decades.  Clearly not only her fans and loved ones have suffered her loss, so has country music.",1227916800,21,4988,4.622727272727273

DVD review: Tammy Wynette, 'Legendary Performances'
Mick LaSalle

Sunday, July 27, 2008

I had no intention of watching this entire DVD. I popped it into the machine only because I realized that I'd never actually seen Tammy Wynette in performance, only heard her. Well, she was brilliant. She arrived as an artist fully formed, in her early 20s, having already endured poverty, child labor, a marriage (with kids) and a divorce. The DVD, which consists of television performances over the course of 14 years, begins with Wynette singing on Southern TV stations, and there's no mistaking that hers was an authentic voice of rural poverty. She was, from the beginning, a brilliant singing actress. She had great intelligence and a quiet but unmistakable toughness. And her voice was amazing. In her earliest performances, she keeps sending the sound mix into distortion because her voice is overpowering the equipment. Even as her wigs got bigger and the music took on a schmaltzy quality, she was amazingly consistent in her focus and emotional honesty. It's funny how artists can get written off in convenient shorthand. For those not fans of country music, Wynette is merely the voice of ""Stand By Your Man"" (albeit a great song), but she was much more - a poet of marital misery, who co-wrote some of her best-known songs. When Wynette sang it, she meant it. The special features are modest but helpful: snippets from 1980s interviews, footage from her 1978 wedding and scenes of her induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, months after her premature death in 1998 at age 55.
