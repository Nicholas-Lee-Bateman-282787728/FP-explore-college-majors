8392406,1,B0039USJOC,This product was terrible. Upon taking out the discs I noticed that the discs were separated into two layers making them unplayable. Was hoping to get a replacement set but then they return process for the  broken ones was  not worth the hassle of try to exchange for a new set that may also be defective!,1468022400,,305,4.428571428571429
