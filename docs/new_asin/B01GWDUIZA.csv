8764169,5,B01GWDUIZA,"I saw this once years ago on TBS, Channel 17 then.  It was called Tales of the Smuggler.  If it is the series I remember, it was great!  Channel 17 added a narrative from the boy Honesty Evans (as an adult) before each episode.  It is a MAJOR shame that I can't find it Region free anywhere.  Please make it watchable here in the USA!",1506643200,,334,4.076923076923077
