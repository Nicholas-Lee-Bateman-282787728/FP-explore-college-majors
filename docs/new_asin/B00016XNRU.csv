1975401,4,B00016XNRU,"I particularily loved this DVD.  However, I think that it should have been structured a little differently, preferrably how Ric Flair's DVD is structured.  I wish that it was a 3 DVD set, maybe Mick's best matches from WCW on disc 1, ECW on disc 2, and finally WWE (WWF) on disc 3.  It does leave out the match with he and Vader at Halloween Havoc (Famous 'Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal' match) that was definately one of my favorites, Mick's battle w/ the Rock at RR '99 in which was my favorite of Mick Foley, they leave out the HIAC match at No Way Out against Triple H, and the Summerslam '97 match in a cage against Triple H.  I wish it could have been more of a chronicle type DVD, like Flair's, because we would have got to have seen (or had clips of) the famouse King of the Death Match Tournament.
All in all this is a good DVD.  They did pick some great matches.  I wish that WWE would have included Mick Foley's greatest feuds on there which were Vader, The Rock, Triple H, and of course Undertaker.  Eventhough there is at least one match from each of those feuds, they are not matches that really said a lot about those feuds.
Mick Foley has had a wonderful career, and will be remembered for decades to come for his contribution to the business.  I say for newer wrestling fans, particularily from '96-present...you will think this is a 5 star DVD, but for wrestling fans who have followed Foley's career for the past 15 years, you might be slightly dissapointed, because most of the matches that really defined him are not included.  There are some great extras that I think everyone will enjoy.  It would have been better for most of the extras be those that led up to particular matches.  But, we can't have it all.  WWE and Mick Foley, u all did a great job, and I hope there will be a volume 2! lol",1074643200,,1817,4.296187683284457
1975402,4,B00016XNRU,"This collection features not only some of the greatest Mick Foley matches of all time, but also some of the greatest moments in all of wrestling.
Much like Ric Flair did on his DVD, Foley introduces the matches with an almost ""shoot"" like quality. He is rather candid on his thoughts ranging from his real life issues with Vince McMahon (which culminated in Foley taking a nineteen month hiatus from the WWE) to his nearly quitting professional wrestling over his accidentally setting Terry Funk on fire in a wrestling stunt gone awry (perhaps thankfully, that footage is NOT included on this set).
While not featuring as many five-star classics as ""The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"", this set, nevertheless, serves as a reminder of one man's dedication to the sport of wrestling and the oft-times disturbing sacrifices he has made along the way.
This set acts as a perfect companion to Foley's biographies, ""Have A Nice Day"" and ""Foley Is Good"". Readers of these two books will instantly recount various chapters as they watch Foley's ancedotes play themselves out.
The reason I am only giving ""Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: A Life In Wrestling"" a near sacreligious four star rating is because of the questionable decision to include (and exclude) a few select matches.
One can almost sense the disdain in Mick's voice as he makes it a point to mention how NOT all of the matches in this collection were hand-picked by him. Case in point, the Texas Death match against the Sandman from ECW. Unfortunately, the first disc is slightly blemished by the inclusion of this match which disrupts the flow of an otherwise great series of matches. Foley does not hide the fact that said match is extremely bad (he refers to it as a ""train wreck""). Then again, it is a Sandman match, so what can you expect really? Still, I would have much rather WWE include footage of FMW's 1995 King of the Death Match Tournament, since footage of it has been used on WWE TV in the past. The absence of the 1999 Royal Rumble match and Halftime Heat, both against The Rock, are also noteworthy. The exclusion of the former is especially striking since it is referenced later on in the Cactus Jack/HHH match from the 2000 Royal Rumble.
Rare interviews and promos such as the now-famous ""Cane Dewey"" and the ""Cactus spits on WCW tag belt"" promos *almost* more than makes up for the lack of a few important matches.
Also, look for Foley's second official match (footage of the first official match doesn't exist according to him)as a VERY svelte Foley and Les Thorntan battle the British Bulldogs from a 1986 episode of ""WWF Superstars""
Whereas ""The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection"" regaled old school wrestling fans with its look at the history of modern professional wrestling, ""Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: A Life In Wrestling"" appeals to newer fans who are most familar with Foley's stints on WWE TV.  Buy this DVD and bare witness to the rise of one of the most memorable wrestling personalities ever.",1074556800,5,2993,4.7891682785299805
1975403,5,B00016XNRU,"Its about time that I got excited about a wrestling DVD comming out. Epecialy exciting seeing tht its a Mick Foley DVD. All of Micks greatest matches including his WWE debue in 1986. This is a must have for any fan of Mick or hardcore wrestling. Matches from ECW, WCW and WWE, you couldn't ask for more. Unless they could add an additional 5 hours added on to it of course. But 6.5 hours will do. This is the life of Mick Foley. Buy it, live it, love it!!!",1074384000,,456,4.134831460674158
1975404,5,B00016XNRU,The WWE have finally releaded a DVD with everything you could possibly want on it. Hardcore wrestling was pervected by mick thou he was not the one to start hardcore he just helped to make it mainstream. Being that ime a fan of hardcore wrestling doesnt mean its my choice of wrestling viewing most of the time ide much rather watch a proper match like Chris Benoit(Pegasis Kid) versus Eddy guerrero (Black Tiger) or Jushin Lyger versus Silver King but then I would rather watch some guy jump of a 30 foot balcony through 10 tables then watch another Los Guerreos versus The self proclaimed worlds greatest tag team match. You should buy this DVD now if you are a fan of Mick or if you have not seen much of his work and would like to. No point in putting the matches down seen as other reviewers have already don't that ide just thought ide give you my opinion on Mick Foley,1074124800,,875,4.374233128834356
1975405,5,B00016XNRU,"According to the trailer, it will include over 5 hours of Foley matches. From clips on the DVD, WWF matches you will see at least in part include The Hell in the Cell with Foley vs. The Undertaker, Foley vs. Triple H at Royal Rumble 2000, Foley vs. Steve Austin from Over the Edge, Foley's WWF championship win over The Rock in Worcester, MA, and Foley vs. Funk from Raw is War.
WCW matches that are showcased in the trailer are the entire Cactus Jack vs. Vader series from 1993, Sting vs. Cactus Jack at WCW Beach Blast '92 and Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys at WCW Spring Stampede 94.
The Foley DVD will also feature, for the first time on a WWE release since they purchased the assets of Extreme Championshp Wrestling, ECW footage of Cactus Jack vs. Sabu (matches from the ECW Arena in 6/94 and Hamburg, PA in 11/94), Foley's farewell match vs. Mikey Whipwreck from the Big Ass Extreme Bash, Cactus Jack & Whipwreck vs. The Public Enemy from 8/94, Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Match from 6/95, and Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack from ECW Hostile City Showdown '95.",1071619200,5,1101,4.401960784313726
1975406,2,B00016XNRU,"From the reviews, I was expecting a three disc set. But I should've known better. The main reason I bought this was because I wanted to see the Mick Foley vs Edge match and the Mick Foley vs Randy Orton match, but it's only 2 discs and doesn't include them.",1430265600,,257,4.16

1975408,4,B00016XNRU,"The first thing Id like to clarify here is that there are 2 separate versions of this boxset. The original 2 disk release and a Hardcore edition which was released a few years later and includes an additional third disk (the first 2 disks are still the same).

The boxset doesnt have a documentary as such, but opens with Mick Foley sitting on a chair in a WWE studio from the 90s and he simply introduces each match with a brief backstory and any personal thoughts or opinions he has on that particular match.

The first disk covers his favourite ECW matches, but as a more traditional WWE fan, I didn't find these particularly interesting.

The second disk is where the money is to be honest and features all his WWE classics such as the Shawn Michaels Mind Games brawl  which he says is his best performance ever  the hell in the cell match with Taker, the Royal Rumble Street fight with Triple H and a few others.

The final disk for those of you interested in the Hardcore edition is a series of matches introduced by Mick Foley and Joey Styles. These matches include the classic Wrestlemania clash with Edge and the Summerslam match with Ric Flair which isn't particularly great to be honest. The important thing to note here is that Mick Foley and Joey Styles do voice over commentary for all the matches on this disk  and there is no option to revert to the original commentary.

Each disk also contains a lot of extras such as pre and post match interviews.

I should also mention here that the old WWF attitude logo is blurred where it exists and really take something away from the viewing pleasure, but this is a common complaint and not something that is unique to this boxset.

Overall this is a nice collection for the Foley fans out there, especially if you want the ECW content,  but not a must own in my view due to a lack of documentary and most of the matches already being available on numerous other boxsets.

No need to pay extra for the Hardcore edition in my opinion!",1417478400,,1992,4.472375690607735

Of course there is always a few matches we wished made it to the set but they did a pretty good job of picking matches.

I just purchased the ""Hardcore Edition,"" which features more recent matches as additions to the original release, but one of the most entertaining matches on the original, the Falls Count Anywhere, from a '97 episode of Raw between Cactus Jack and HHH has been removed!

1975426,4,B00016XNRU,"This review is for the 2-disc version without the 'hardcore edition' label in front. First off I found this set to be a pleasant surprise. Instead of having the usual one hour biography segment, Mick Foley does a short in-studio intro before every match.

I found Mick to be candid and pleasant. He gave some interesting anecdotes and it was nice to see his everyday persona(as opposed to his wrestling characters). On a couple of the ECW matches, he also does commentary with 'the Coach'.

The matches included was diverse and gave a nice sampling of Foley's body of work(ECW,WCW,WWF). Also included are his promo spots/interviews over the years with his many different personas. I found out later that there was a newer 'Hardcore Edition' with his WWE matches(I've never seen these). I recommend this newer edition(with 3-disc).",1333584000,,830,5.007246376811594
1975427,4,B00016XNRU,"Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses doesn't disappoint. Most of the matches on the first disc I have never seen before and they were amazing. The ECW matches as Cactus Jack lived up to their name. I was glad to see the Street Fight he had with Triple H on the DVD set. It's a good thing I waited til after the Hardcore Edition came out to buy this DVD set, because I absolutely loved Mick's matches with Randy Orton and Edge. The Extreme tag match at One Night Stand was incredible as well. The only match I didn't really like on there was the I Quit match Mick had with Ric Flair. I'm from Massachusetts and bought tickets for Summer Slam when it came to Boston. When it was time for the I Quit match, I went to go buy a t-shirt or a souvenir, because I didn't want to see an old man with flabby man tits (EWWWWWW!!!) in the ring. The problem I had with that match was Ric Flair being in the match and furthermore him actually winning the match was unrealistic. I mean, God!! Ric is like in his 70s and he beat a guy who was 30 plus years younger than him? How unrealistic can you get? Aside from the I Quit match with Flair, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD.",1328572800,,1168,4.149779735682819
1975428,4,B00016XNRU,"The Hardcore Legend, Dude Love, Ms. Foley's Baby Boy, Mankind, Cactus Jack, whatever you want to call him, but fans know Mick Foley as one of the toughest to ever step in the ring. This is a look into the career of Foley from his early days of WCW to ECW to SMW and of course WWE as well as classic matches, promos and comments from Foley himself about the matches and his career.

-4/17/93, WCW Saturday Night, vs. Big Van Vader w/Harley Race: Its a pretty stiff match as Cactus beats down the champ, but he comes back bashing Jack in the corner and does end up breaking his nose with some hard punches. Cactus gets a second wind knocking Vader off his feet then to the outside even clotheslining him into the guardrail, then manager Harley Race gets a clothesline. Vader starts punching away and busts open Cactus, then hits the Vader Bomb, but on the outside Vader accidentaly punches Race. Later on the outside Vader misses a splash and hits the guardrail, Cactus hits a flip splash and Vader gets counted out. 6/10.

-4/17/94, WCW Spring Stampede, Chicago Street Fight, w/Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys: Nothing more than a brawl, which is to be expected with these four involved, so many weapons are used including a pool cue, a few chairs, a shovel and tables among others and this went all over the ringside area. Knobbs got slammed through a table by Payne, Cactus suplexed a table onto Saggs, then Cactus got sent from the ramp to the floor, Saggs hits a shovel shot on Jack and makes the cover to win. 7/10.

-6/24/94, ECW Hostile City Showdown, vs. Sabu: In the opening minutes it seemed like Cactus wasn't interested in fighting back as Sabu nailed some kicks, punches and he stomped down Cactus in the corner and worked on his injured shoulder. Of course there's action on the outside, some hard chair shots from Sabu, then Cactus comes back hitting a big clothesline over the top, Sabu hits a big leg kick into the corner. After Paul E. hits Cactus with his phone, Sabu covers and wins. 6/10. Afterwards the action ends up going into the crowd, Cactus hits a piledriver onto a concessions table, back in the ring Sabu breaks a beer bottle over Jack's head, then Cactus gets put face first through the table. Cactus comes back suplexing the table on Sabu and the action just sort of ends.

-11/18/94, Smokey Mountain Wrestling, vs. Chris Candido: Not a bad match here, there was some decent wrestling and the expected brawling on the outside. Jack comes back but ends up hitting the ring post and Chris focuses on it with an arm bar, even leg dropping the arm at one point. Cactus comes back with a swinging neckbreaker, then Candido hits a big frankensteiner but misses a splash from the top. Jack ends up taking this one after some interference on Candido's behalf. 5/10.

-2/4/95, ECW, Texas Death Match, vs. The Sandman: Foley said before the match that Sandman was out on his feet and you could tell as he was a few steps off as he wouldn't stay down even though he probably should've. There's some hard chair shots by Cactus and Sandman keeps battling back even hitting a piledriver spiking Foley's head onto a chair. Sandman also worked over Cactus' leg a bit and DDT'd him into the chair, but Cactus wouldn't stay down either. Cactus hit 3 DDT's on the concrete floor and Sandman finally stayed down and Cactus won. 4/10.

-11/18/95, ECW November 2 Remember, w/ Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer: A totally wild brawl that went all over the arena, Funk/Cactus & Dreamer/Raven paired off and all kinds of weapons were brought in, Funk threw a chair into the ring hitting Raven in the back of the head. They use street signs, a shopping cart on Stevie Richards, a golf club, a shovel, a VCR and the dreaded cheese grater among others which got big reactions from the crowd. Its just an insane brawl where even the referee gets nailed with some weapons, and in all this mayhem Funk covers Raven for the win. 7/10. The brawling continues with Raven wraps some barbwire around his head and headbutts Dreamer very low, Funk and Cactus battle to the back.

-3/9/96, ECW Big A** Extreme Bash, vs. Mikey Whipwreck: This was Foley's final ECW match and its not a bad one, Jack targets Mikey's injured neck, hammering and kicking the back of it. He misses a couple of chair shots then hits Mikey with a forearm, back in the ring Mikey hits the Cactus clothesline then rams the back of Jack's head into the guardrail. Later Mikey hits an impressive dive into the crowd onto Cactus who comes back attacking Mikey's neck more, hitting a hangman's neckbreaker onto the guardrail. They battle up into the crowd where Mikey hits a nice dive from the balcony, back in the ring Cactus slams Mikey with a chair a few times then the spike piledriver onto a chair and Cactus wins the match. 7/10. Nice ovation from the crowd as they showed Foley their appreciation.

Extras on Disc 1

-Post-Vader Match Interview: Right after their match Cactus Jack talks about how he can and will beat the monster Vader. Good promo

-Cactus Spits on the WCW Belt: After losing to Sabu, Cactus talks about how the WCW tag belt is important to him but he felt he lost his pride on this night. Really good promo

-""Cane Dewey"" Promo: One of the best promos I've seen as Foley just rips on the fans of ECW for a couple of fans that had a sign that said ""Cane Dewey"", referring to Foley's young son. He also points out that Tommy Dreamer has a chance to not make the same mistakes he's made in wrestling.

-""Anti-Hardcore"" Promo: Cactus Jack again rips on the ECW fans in another great promo.

-ECW Farewell Speech: After his match with Mikey Whipwreck he gave a pretty emotional speech thanking the ECW fans for giving him the ovation they did after all the nasty things he said about them.

-WWE Confidential Featurette: Foley talks about how he needed to step away from the wrestling business and didn't talk to Vince for the 19 months he was gone. He said he did miss helping kids in need and making their days a little brighter. Pretty good piece here.

-6/20/92, WCW Beach Blast, No DQ/Falls Count Anywhere Match for the WCW Heavyweight Championship, vs. Sting (Champion): It started off quickly with Sting taking it to Cactus, who comes back nailing a sunset flip off the ring apron for two. Its actually a pretty good match, Sting beats up Cactus on the floor, slamming him into the guardrail, but Cactus comes back with a spinning clothesline and locks on a body scissors. Cactus counters a Stinger Splash into the guardrail and uses a chair on Sting, but they battle up the ramp, a double arm DDT by Cactus for two. Sting hits a big clothesline off the top and pins Cactus on the ramp for the win. 8/10. Includes audio commentary by Mick Foley & Jonathan Coachman.

(Available on Falls Count Anywhere)

-9/30/94, ECW, vs. Sabu: This was their rematch and while better than their previous encounter it wasn't an all time great match. Cactus chokes Sabu on the ring ropes and targets his neck, Sabu comes back hitting a springboard moonsault to the outside but hits the guardrail sternum first. 911 & Jack fight a bit, before Sabu gets back up then meets a chair head first, they battle up into the crowd and Sabu gets piledriving into the stage. Sabu hits a nice dive off the stage, Cactus comes back nailing him with a trash can all the way to the ring. The end where a beer bottle doesn't break over Jack's head is pretty brutal as Sabu had to hit him over and over until it finally broke then Sabu hit a splash and pinned Cactus for three. 7/10. Also includes audio commentary by Mick Foley & Jonathan Coachman.

-9/13/86, WWE, Superstars, w/Les Thornton vs. The British Bulldogs: Foley says this is his second career match, there's nothing of note really except for Dynamite Kid hitting a clothesline that tore a ligament in his jaw. 3/10 as its basically a squash.

Disc 2

-9/22/96-In Your House: Mind Games, WWE Title Match, vs. Shawn Michaels (Champion): Very nice hardcore match, this showed the evolution of Michaels' aggressive streak, while at the same time showing just how hard Mankind was to keep down. Shawn did a great job early in weakening Mankind, by going for his knee and using lots of wrestling holds. But soon after Mankind began to dominate, and even used a few wrestling holds of his own including a nice fisherman's roll-up pin, then lots of back and forth action occurs. Nice spot where both men are on the top rope and both fall back and go through the announce table. The end is a bit of a downer as both Vader and Sid interfere to cause a DQ after about 26 minutes. The aftermath saw Mankind use the Mandible Claw to choke out Shawn then called for the ringside casket to be opened, but the Undertaker popped up and chased off Mankind. 11/10.

(Available on Mick Foley Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops and Shawn Michaels From The Vault)

-9/22/97, Raw, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Triple H: This was an intense brawl that went into the crowd and all over the arena, HHH got thrown into the guardrail, knocking it down. HHH did get some good shots in but in the end Cactus hit a piledriver through a table on the stage and pinned him for the win. 7/10.

(Available on Falls Count Anywhere)

-5/4/98, Raw, Falls Count Anywhere Match, vs. Terry Funk, Special Guest Referee, Pat Patterson: Stone Cold Steve Austin was on commentary which was funny, these two had a good brawl with Funk using a chair on Foley, which busted him open in the back of the head. Foley comes back taking it to his idol, but he gets another chair shot to the head. They battle into the crowd, Funk hits a moonsault from about 10 feet up knocking down Foley and some officials. Foley hits a piledriver through a table, they go under the bleachers and fight in the back and back out into the ring. Funk takes a beating but won't stay down, it takes a spike piledriver onto a steel chair to keep him down for three. 8/10. Austin comes in and throws his beer in Foley's face and they have stare down which leads to the next match.

-5/31/98, Over The Edge, WWE Title Match, vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion), Special Guest Referee, Vince McMahon: Undertaker was at ringside and with all the odds against Austin, he kept having to fight off Patterson & Brisco at ringside, Vince's officiating and of course Foley himself. Its the expected brawl, Foley takes a hard clotheline off the guardrail to the concrete floor, they battle to the stage where Austin gets backdropped onto a car hood. Back in the ring Foley uses a chair and hits a double arm DDT but only gets two, Austin gets the chair and hits a brutal chair shot but Vince won't make the count and he gets smashed with a chair from Foley on accident. After another ref gets knocked out, Taker prevents Patterson & Brisco from making the count and chokeslams both of them through the announce tables. Austin hits the stunner and Vince counts to three with some help from Austin. 10/10.

(Available on Mick Foley Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops and Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line...)

-6/28/98, King of the Ring, Hell In A Cell Match, vs. The Undertaker: Without question the most famous cell match in history. Mankind takes a huge fall from the top through the announce table in the first couple of minutes, after some time he comes back up the aisle and climbs the cage, takes a chokeslam through the ceiling of the cage and almost blacks out from the fall and a chair smashing him in the face. Pretty brutal action as there's thumbtacks, blood and a tombstone that puts Mankind down for the 3 count. 10/10. I do like that the post match ovation was included as the crowd cheered big for Foley.

(Available on Hell In A Cell Collection, Tombstone History of the Undertaker, OMG Top 50 Incidents in WWE History)

-1/4/99, Raw, WWE Championship Match, vs. The Rock: DX and the Corporation were at ringside and this was a good match where Rock was beating on Mankind but Foley wouldn't stay down and kept fighting back. After locking on the Manible Claw, Ken Shamrock runs in, hits Mankind with a chair and a brawl between the Corporation and DX. During this Austin's music hits to a thunderous reaction, he hits the ring, whacks Rock with a chair, puts Mankind on the Rock, the ref counts three and Mankind wins his first WWE title. 7/10.

(Available on Raw 15th Anniversary)

-1/23/00, Royal Rumble, Street Fight for the WWE Championship, vs. Triple H (Champion): The build-up for this was very intense and felt quite real and this match lived up to and surpassed it. Cactus brought his A-game and Trips did elevate his game (no pun intended) as he hung with Foley and took a hell of a beating while dishing one out. Trips takes a suplex onto a wooden palet and a piece of it stabs him in the leg. Foley gets cuffed and beaten with a chair out into the aisle way before the Rock comes in for the save. Foley gets back dropped into some tacks, then pedigreed but he kicks out. Trips hits another pedigree into the tacks and covers Cactus for the win to retain his title. Best match of the night, one of the best title matches I've seen. 10/10.

However as you can see some are featured on other sets so if you are a big Foley fan then pick it up as its good stuff but you don't have to have it.",1318291200,2,14286,4.5088940448569215
1975429,5,B00016XNRU,Great value for 3 dvd collection.  Shows all his greatest matches.  Love the bonus disc with foley commentary.  can't believe how cheap it is...,1317513600,,144,4.916666666666667
1975430,5,B00016XNRU,"While he makes appearances for TNA these days and is known as a best selling author, Mick Foley (also known as Cactus Jack, Dude Love and Mankind) is best known for his exploits in WWE, WCW, Smokey Mountain Wrestling and in (the REAL) ECW! This special edition DVD is actually re-release of the original in 2004 with an added disc which covers his career up until 2006.

Disc 1:

Cactus Jack Vs. Big Van Vader - This was their first encounter on WCW Saturday Night in April of 1993 and I would highly recommend viewing this match to those that remember this brutal affair and to those that only know Vader from his WWE days! At this point, he was WCW World Champion and was a VERY brutal and stiff wrestler as he actually broke Foley's nose (legitimately) during this match! This match is also shown unedited in terms of match footage. Unfortunately, the commentary has been edited as Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura's commentary is edited out! That sucks but I would still encourage viewing this bout!

Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne Vs. The Nasty Boys (Chicago Street Fight) - This is from WCW Spring Stampede in 1994 (a year to the day when the previous match happened and one of WCW's best cards I might add)! This one is nasty (no pun intended)! Watch for a particular vicious fall by Foley to the concrete floor!

Cactus Jack Vs. Sabu - This was in June of 1994 and was their first ever meeting. Cactus was still wrestling for WCW at this point but was used in a talent exchange and ECW (ran by Paul Heyman) used this to get a dream match of Cactus Vs. Sabu! While these two would go on to have better matches against each other, this first encounter wasn't bad.

Cactus Jack Vs. Chris Candido (RIP) - This was the early days of Candido and Tammy Lynn Sytch (who you may recognize as WWE's Sunny). Ends with a Cactus victory and run-ins from Tammy, Boo Bradly and Brian Lee! Not a great match but not a bad one either.

Cactus Jack Vs. Sandman (Texas Death Match) - This one, admittedly, was one of their WORST matches together and even Foley admits this! It does have a few stiff moments, particular a vicious piledriver by Sandman on Foley that severely hurts his neck! Sandman, by the way, was actually out of it for most of the bout and pretty much had to be led by Mick! Interesting to view, but don't expect anything great out of this.

Cactus Jack & Raven Vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - This one was a gruesome affair from ECW November 2 Remember in 1995! If you are into violence and blood, this one is for you as there is plenty of both in this one!

Cactus Jack Vs. Mikey Whipwreck - In his last match for the original ECW, Cactus took on his former tag team partner in March of 1996. This was a very good contest and not only showed the best of Cactus but Mikey showed his wears as well here.

DVD EXTRAS:
Post-Vader Match Interview

Cactus Jack Vs. Sting (Falls Count Anywhere Match) - This features commentary from Foley and Johnathan Coachman. THIS IS A MUST VIEW FOR THIS DVD!

DISC 2

This DVD focuses on his WWE career.

Introducing.....MANKIND! - The early promos for the coming of Mankind and Foley's take on the character and how he ALMOST didn't do the character!

Mankind Vs. Shawn Michaels - This is from In Your House: Mindgames and while it isn't often talked about, this was a wild match! Not an ECW match but done in the ECW style and we also see a more aggressive Shawn Michaels for one of the first times too! Look for run-ins from Vader, ""Sycho"" Sid and The Undertaker in this one!

Also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-From-the-Vault-Shawn-Michaels/dp/B00009AV91/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE From the Vault - Shawn Michaels</a>

Cactus Jack Vs. HHH (Falls Count Anywhere) - This was before HHH's DX days and this was on WWE RAW! Originally scheduled to be Dude Love, Foley did a classic promo reintroducing his Cactus character with Dude Love and Mankind doing the honors!

As for the match itself, it was classic ECW in WWE and one of the first in the ""Attitude"" era.

Mick Foley Vs. Terry Funk - This one was on RAW in 1998 and went everywhere. It was also a Falls Count Anywhere deal with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and Jim Ross commentating! Funk (who was 53 when this bout happened) proved he can still put on a good match and against Foley, it was classic mayhem! Austin also added to it by beating up Jerry ""The King"" Lawler and taking over his spot at the announce table!

Dude Love Vs. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin - Foley faced Austin twice as Dude Love at WWE Unforgiven '98 and WWE Over The Edge '98. This one was from Over The Edge '98 and is the better of the two. McMahon decides to stack the deck against Austin by making the announcer Pat Patterson, the time keeper Gerald Brisco and himself as special referee but unexpected by all parties was the appearance of The Undertaker as he made sure this match went down the middle (for all intents and purposes)! A wild encounter to say the least and was the beginning of the Undertaker/Austin battles that went through the summer of '98 and main evented that years' SummerSlam.

Mankind Vs. The Undertaker - The match that is often talked about when discussing Mick's career and, in my opinion (other than his ""I Quit"" match with The Rock at The Royal Rumble '99), was the worst beating he ever took! Foley took two 14-18 foot falls during this match off the top of this cage and somehow finished the match despite being knocked out for most of it! It also saw the first time (in WWE anyway) that he used the now infamous thumbtacks but it was The Undertaker that utilized them on Foley!

Mankind Vs. The Rock - This was for the WWE Title and it was on RAW. A little sidenote in that this was actually taped towards the end of 1998 but was shown on January 4, 1999.

Also, this the infamous night on WCW Nitro where Tony Schivone announced that (and I am paraphrasing a bit here) ""Mick Foley, who used to wrestle here as Cactus Jack, is going to win their world title. Well, that'll put some butts in the seats!"" That came back to haunt them as almost half their audience who thought they were going to see Kevin Nash Vs. Hulk Hogan (which turned into their infamous ""Fingerpoke Of Doom"" incident), turned immediately to RAW! LOL!

Back to this match, it wasn't his best match with The Rock but it was a wild affair nonetheless. Ends with a wild celebration when Foley (with the help of Degeneration X and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin) wins! I could be wrong but I haven't heard a pop for a win like that in a long time on either WWE RAW, WWE Smackdown or even TNA Impact! Man I miss those days! LOL!

Cactus Jack Vs. HHH - This is their famous street fight match at The Royal Rumble 2000 for the WWE Championship. While everyone knew that HHH was a good wrestler and was fairly tough, no one knew how tough he could be until this match! This is the one that put him on the map as a true contender in a lot of fans eyes.

As for the match itself, it was classic Cactus Jack all the way! Though he lost, HHH looked more like the loser than Jack did! Definitely worth seeing.

Commissioner Foley & Kurt Angle - The Commish books a match

DISC 3
This is the bonus disc that wasn't on the original release! All the commentary is done by Mick Foley and ECW announcer Joey Styles.

Mick Foley Vs. Randy Orton (No Holds Barred Match) - This was from Backlash 2004. I have often said that Randy's crowning moment was his World Heavyweight Title win over the now infamous Chris Benoit but prior to that, this is the match that made fans take him seriously as a possible contender to that belt! Randy takes some nasty shots, especially when a missed RKO landed him into some thumbtacks! His reaction has to be seen to be believed! Foley loses BUT it does give him (Orton) credibility and helps him into a main event position months later.

Mick Foley Vs. Edge w/Lita - This is their hardcore match from WrestleMania 22 and was arguably the show-stealer of that WM! This also established Edge as a legit contender to the WWE title in the fans' eyes because though he held the belt prior to this, it was under questionable circumstances. This match erased all doubt that Edge belonged in the main event status. Once again, Foley helps a guy out with a great performance. Also available on WWE WrestleMania 22 and WWE - Edge: A Decade of Decadence.

Mick Foley & Edge & Lita Vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer & Beulah - This was from ECW One Night Stand 2006 and was probably the show stealer from that card as well! Cactus and Funk do their classic hardcore stuff while Edge shows that he could go that style. We even get to see some female brawling with Beulah and the former Ms. Congeniality (for those that remember that gimick that Lita went under in ECW). Ends when Edge spears Beulah (classic ECW move, attacking a woman) and does a VERY PROVOCATIVE cover on her! Even the ref is hesitant to count at first! LOL! Very good match!

Also available on ECW: One Night Stand and ECW Extreme Rules.

Mick Foley Vs. ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair (""I Quit"" Match) - This was a very good match BUT it doesn't hold up as well as the other Hardcore stuff! Still, to see both Foley and (especially) Flair this vicious was quite different! The ending kind of messes it up but up until that, it was a very good match but Foley really wanted more and you should hear his comments on not only Flair during this match but also Melina and WWE Creative!

Also available on WWE SummerSlam 2006 and WWE Summerslam: The Complete Anthology, Volume Four.

The orignal dvd did contain the unforgetable Hell in the Cell match against Undertaker which made him a household name. I never really liked Foley as a performer and I don't know why. I do respect what he's done for wrestling but I still don't rank him up there with greatest of all time. The dvd should have showed his matches in Japan, where he truly was a violent wrestler. The upgrade is the only reason to get this dvd because those were some of his best matches. His match against Randy Orton and Edge are probably the best stateside performances Foley ever put on.

However, the addition of the third disk makes up for the missing true favorite bouts, and not the ones hand picked for him.  The action is real, extremely intense (with most every bout in each disk), and still worth every penny despite Foley's own admission that some of the matches are not his best/favorite....

I am, however, disappointed that his cage match with Hunter (in which he redid his ""fall through the cage"" bit, this time breaking the canvas of the ring) was not on here, as I feel it is also one of his bests.

In all, the disk is still outstanding despite the omissions.",1179273600,,857,4.57516339869281

Disk One:
Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader WCW Saturday Night 4/17/1993
Some of the latter day hardcore fans may not like this one, but it was good for its time. Cactus wins.

Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys in a Chicago Street Fight
This one took place at WCW Spring Stampede 4/17/1994. I was very impressed with this match. I never thought I would see something like that in WCW (especially in 1994!) Nasty Boys win.

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu ECW Hostile City Showdown 6/24/1994
Cactus was sent to ECW by WCW to wrestle this match. Very entertaining with some nice spots. Sabu wins.

Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido SMW 11/18/1994
Nice match for Smokey Mountain Wrestling. Cactus Jack wins.

Cactus Jack vs. Sandman in a Texas Death Match ECW 2/4/1995
Not as great as I thought it would be, but still good. You could tell in some spots that Sandman wasn't in his right mind! To win this one, you had to pin. Then he had to stay down for a ten count (kind of a mix between a regular match and a Last Man Standing match.) Cactus wins.

Cactus & Raven vs. Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer ECW November 2 Remember
This match was AWESOME! Many weapons used including a VCR, a cheese grador, and a frying pan! Funk and Dreamer win.

Cactus vs. Mikey Whipwreck ECW 3/9/1996

Nice  to see these two friends battle it out. Foley wins.

Dude Love vs. Stone Cold World Title Over the Edge 5/31/1998
This was Foley's greatest match as the Dude Love character. Add Vince McMahon as special guest referee and Undertaker at ring side during the entire match and your in for a treat! Austin wins.

Mankind vs. Undertaker Hell in a Cell King of the Ring 6/28/1998
This is the match that Foley will be remembered most for. Him falling of and through the cage was amazing. Add a steal chair and some thumb tacts and you get one of the greatest Hell in a Cell match ever. Undertaker wins.

Mankind vs. The Rock World Title Raw 1/4/1999
This was a emotional one for Mick Foley and a decent match. Mankind wins his first of three World Titles.

Cactus Jack vs. HHH in a Street Fight World Tile Royal Rumble 1/23/2000

Foley, Edge, and Lita vs. Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk, and Beulah ECW One Night Stand 6/11/2006
This match, in my opinion, was the greatest one from one night stand. Barbed wire, fire, and other weapons were used. Foley, Edge, & Lita win.

Only this time you will get an extra disk in the DVD set that comes with a couple of extra matches. Let me be clear...if you are a new fan of wrestling, this is ESSENTIAL!!! This has some of the greatest matches ever released. I will admit some are not as good as others, but there are some rare gems...

DISK 1:

Cactus Jack and Max Payne vs. The Nasty Boys:

Wild brawl from WCW that had the use of a lot of weapons, chairs, tables, and more than one wild spot! Cactus Jack at one point suplexes a table onto one of the nasty boys on the ramp leading to the ring in a great spot. However the Nasty Boys get the win after Cactus gets leveled with a shovel to the head...8/10

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu:

Many people actually believed one of these two would die because they were each that violent. The match is back and forth but many considered it a let down...even Mick himself. But nonetheless this is still an entertaining match and there were table spots, don't worry. Sabu at one point had Cactus on a table in the audience and did a moonsault off the top rope onto Cactus through the table! The ending was kinda cheap but Sabu wins a good fight. 7.5/10

Cactus Jack and Raven vs. Tommy Dreamer and Terry Funk:

There was not one wrestling move in this entire match! More and more weapons were used and Stevie Richards at one point makes an apperance but pays for it! Cant remember who wins, I am doing this review based on memory [yes, I have watched this DVD set that many times] but it was a great match to watch for the violence! 8.5/10

Other matches include

Cactus Jack vs. Vader

Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman [Texas Death Match]

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck [Cactus' last match in ECW]

DISK 2:

Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk:

This was one of the rarest matches that had Mick wrestle as himself. These two tore the roof down and it was even better because Stone Cold Steve Austin was on commentary! Tables, chairs, trashcans, and brutality is what resulted when these two legendary figures met in the ring! Mick Foley wins...9/10

Mankind vs. The Undertaker:

The famous Hell in a Cell match that had Mankind getting thrown twice off the roof of the cage; once on top of the announce table, the other through the roof of the cage. Thumbtacks and chairs would also make appearances in the match and Taker wins. 10/10

Cactus Jack vs. HHH:

The famous street fight from Royal Rumble 2000. Anything and everything was used. Barbed wire, thumbtacks, tables, steel steps, handcuffs, chairs, trashcans, sledghammers, just to name a few! Cactus at one point was handcuffed and took some brutal chair shots to the head, but fought back and sliced HHH's head open with his trusy barbed wire 2 by 4. HHH wins after pedigreeing Cactus face first onto a pile of tacks! 11/10

other matches include

HBK vs. Mankind [Mick calls it the greatest match in his career]

Mankind vs. The Rock [when foley won the title]

Cactus Jack vs. HHH [the first time these two fought, not the best but still really good]

and finally the third disk includes:

Cactus Jack vs. Randy Orton:

This is what the wwe was lacking the most in 2004...VIOLENCE!!! Luckily this is a rare treat that had Randy proving he has what it takes to go hardcore. Orton at one point fell back first onto a pile of tacks without a shirt on! His back looked like a pincushion! A huge board of barbed wire makes an appearance, as does chairs, cookie sheets, tables, and trashcans! Great match that Randy won. 10/10

Cactus Jack vs. Edge:

This was from last year, and it was also as brutal as any Cactus Jack match was. tacks, tables, fire, and barbed wire make appearances. Edge wins after spearing Foley through the ring ropes onto a table set on fire! 10/10

Cactus Jack vs. Ric Flair:

This was an I Quit match that had both men taking huge punishment. Foley at one point gave a scoop slam to Flair onto tacks, then flair fought back and knocked foley out of the ring right to the floor! Flair even gave his chops while wearing Mr. Socko wrapped in barbed wire! Flair wins in a cheap ending as Melina comes down and starts interfering...bad ending to a great feud and match. 9/10

the last match is Mick Foley and Edge vs. Tommy Dreamer and Terry Funk from ECW One Night Stand 2006 [VIOLENT MATCH]

A hardcore legend in Mick Foley will go down in history for being able to control the crowd, being violent & hardcore, and also being able to be one of the most lovable characters in wrestling. This was originally released as a 2 disc set spanning his matches from his career in WCW to one of his final performances in his career as a full time competitor but with his return to WWE, WWE released this once again as a 3 disc ""Hardcore Edition"" set with matches from his return to the ring in 2004 & 2006 and additional commentary from Foley himself along with Joey Styles.  Now keep in mind for this review that I already had the original 2 disc version & caught the 3rd ""Hardcore Edition"" disc on a WWE 24/7 replay so I don't know the bonus material or hidden extras on this third disc.

Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader - This was their first one on one encounter where Vader targeted Cactus' face right from the start & throughout the match with heavy blows to the point where Cactus' nose was broken & bleeding while Cactus still took the fight to Vader countering his corner splash into a slam along with various clotheslines from the top rope & the outside knocking down the railing before getting his shot in on Harley Race as well.  This went a little over 10 mins. but was hard hitting for it's time to the point where Foley himself explained how WCW spend hours editing out all the blood from the match but we get the unedited version here.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Apr. 93

Chicago Street Fight: Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys - Cactus was walking into this match with a wrap around his ear from recently losing it during the infamous match against Vader in Germany.  The fight started in the isleway between both teams that saw a pool cue broke over Cactus' head in the early moments before the brawl was taken to the merchandise stand with everything from tables & guardrails being destroyed in the process.  Things got more dangerous on the rampway as a table broke under the weight of both Saggs & Cactus when attempting a piledriver before Cactus was thrown off the ramp to the concrete floor & knocked out with a stiff shot to the face with a shovel.  This was a match that fit everyone's style of an out of control brawling style but it was one of those matches where you can tell that things got a little too out of hand with some of the hits they were giving each other during & even after the match.
WCW Spring Stampede 94

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - There are different stories in regards to how Cactus Jack was able to work this match in ECW while still being under contract with WCW but whatever the circumstances were lead to what was a dream match at that time between two of the most unpredictable & ""hardcore"" wrestlers at that time.  Cactus came in the match with a bad shoulder while Sabu had his manager Paul E. Dangerously & his bodyguard 911 in his corner.  Sabu targeted Cactus' head with various leaping kicks to the back of the head before using a chair which Cactus later gave a receipt for along with using a frying pan on Sabu & himself.  The match briefly went into the front row & around ringside with 911 getting involved while Sabu again used his body as a weapon with moves like the triple jump moonsault over the guardrail onto Cactus through a table & Dangerously using his trademark cell phone when he had the opportunity to.  This didn't live up to the ""someone's going to get killed"" hype that it had according to Foley himself but it was a good match with the aftermath being more crazy than the match itself with all the appearances from various stars, people being knocked out with chairs, bottles busted over heads, brawling through the crowd, and tables broken.

[ECW: The Best Of Cactus Jack]

Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido - Cactus was dominate early brawling in the ring with punches & biting plus grounding him several times while also going to the floor with his trademark top rope clothesline & even taking Candido to the front row at one point.  Candido was able to finally get an advantage using Cactus' momentum against him working over his arm using the post & an armbar plus showing some aerial offense with an over the top crossbody & top rope headbutt.  This was an average match between both men only to continue their current storyline at that time with other people who had their associations with both men getting involved as well but overall just here to showcase his time in the Smokey Mountain Wrestling promotion.
""Smokey Mountain Wrestling"" Nov. 94

Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sandman - Sandman was jumped during his entrance & nailed with several chairshots that you clearly saw effected him as he could barely stand causing his offense to be nothing more than shoving & throwing Cactus down on the outside but also taking a long break between each move while also falling down himself irish whipping Cactus into the corner & attempting to work on the leg with Woman getting a shot in at ringside.  A chair got involved with both men taking some hard hits on it such as backdrops & piledrivers & DDT before one man took control with him having to deliver some serious punishment to not only take the other man down but keep him down.  As Foley stated before the match, this was a trainwreck due to Sandman's early concussion & the match stipulation definitely hurt more than help here.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Feb. 95

Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer - It was during this period that Cactus Jack had joined Raven's Nest & was rebelling against the hardcore environment of ECW to the point where he would cut promos & wear t-shirts showing support to the rival company of WCW to the point where he was wearing a ""Dungeon Of Doom"" shirt for this match.  This brawl started both in & out of the ring with Funk using whatever he could get his hands such as a chair on Cactus & throwing it in the ring hitting Raven before more weapons were introduced from a snow shovel to VCR to a toilet seat to a golf club with the referee getting hit with a dustpan for his troubles while a cheese grader was the cause of blood being shed with all this violence inspiring a brand new chant from the audience.  Cactus had no other choice to but to get hardcore himself stabbing Funk in the head & arm while still playing mind games showing another t-shirt of the most hated man in ECW that caused Dreamer to pull it over his head & beat the crap out of the image on it while more hardcore violence occurred including a DDT on a chair, others getting busted open, more weapons introduced, cameo appearances, and a post-match brawl involving a head wrapped in barbed wire & camera cables being used.  This was the hardcore weapons brawl that ECW built their reputation on.

[ECW: The Best Of Cactus Jack]

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck - This was not only his last match in ECW but was also scheduled to be the last time we saw the Cactus Jack persona as Mikey came in with a neck brace due to an previous attack from Cactus which he targeted right away with various blows.  Mikey fought back using Cactus' own clothesline over the top rope sending him into the guardrail headfirst & continued to dish out his own punishment with a belly to back suplex on the floor, superkicking a chair into Cactus' face, and his own somersault over the railing into the crowd while Cactus' continued to focus on Mikey's neck with a back suplex into a table & his own Cactus clothesline over the railing before taking the match back into the ring removing the neck brace punishing the neck even more with a piledriver & double arm DDT.  They continued to brawl in the crowd & in the ring while also having such moments like Foley clutching a Lenord Cohen album (if you ever saw the promo he did before this match, you'll get the joke) while both targeted each others head with chairshots resulting in a match that wasn't a ""hardcore war"" more of an emotional battle with the one man that Cactus helped in ECW more than anyone else.

[ECW: The Best Of Cactus Jack]

Mankind vs. WWE Champion Shawn Michaels - Paul Bearer pushed a casket with Mankind inside of it before the match & you got the tone of what this match was going to be within the first few minutes when both men took it to the floor with Shawn stomping on the outside mat with Mankind underneath it, delivering a flying crossbody to the outside & whipping his head back onto the concrete floor.  This match quickly evolved into a brawl with both men throwing fist & going back to the outside with Shawn targeting the leg after delivering a suplex that resulted in Mankind's leg slamming into the steps followed by driving the leg into the casket & various submissions.  Mankind fought back working over Shawn in corner with two double axe handles in the Tree Of Woe but also took punishment as his knee once again ran into the steps, took a drop toe hold to the face, and his head wrapped between the ropes but still able to catch Shawn in the Mandible Claw which caused Shawn to focus on that hand as he attacked it using a chair multiple times & stomps.  Both men traded momentum from here with both taking the punishment together such as a superplex through the outside table & Mankind getting a superkick to the face with a chair on the top rope before various associates got involved.  Foley stated that this was the best match in his career in his first book, Shawn would later state that this was his favorite match during his first WWE Championship defense during the ""Boyhood Dream"" run, and various people claimed this to be the match of the year for 1996 as this was a standout encounter in both of their careers.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley - This was originally scheduled to be Dude Love participating but thanks to an entertaining video the the ""3 Faces Of Foley"", we saw the WWE debut of Cactus Jack & started the match with a bang by nailing Hunter in the head with the trash can followed by a neckbreaker on the concrete floor. Both men fought backstage & back to the ring with Chyna making her presence known while Cactus used the fire extinguisher & even breaking the guardrail before missing a move that caused him to land on the metal trash can. Hunter showed he was no stranger to dishing out the offense himself as he used a mop handle, chair, snow shovel, and trash can while suplexing Cactus on the metal ramp but it was when they made their way to the top of the entrance where a piledriver was given that you can to see to believe. Definitely one of the wildest brawls in RAW history.
""RAW"" Sept. 97
[Falls Count Anywhere]

Hardcore Match: Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk - Foley wrestled this match as himself with the incentive being that he had to defeat Terry Funk in order to get another WWE Title shot with Pat Patterson as the special referee & Steve Austin on commentary who kept having problems with his headset causing him to take it out on someone else at ringside.  Both men brawled to the floor early with Funk nailing Foley with various headshots before Foley was able to give a receipt & work over Funk's neck while bleeding from the back of the head.  The fight continued into the crowd where everyone who got in their way was assaulted with Funk doing a moonsault onto everyone that hurt his own neck with Foley capitalizing with a piledriver through a table before brawling backstage & back to the ring area where Foley continued to punish Funk with various DDT's & piledrivers along with the elbow drop off the apron onto Funk on the announce table with a chair resulting in a physical hardcore war between both men.
""RAW"" May 98

Falls Count Anywhere Match w/special guest referee Mr. McMahon: Dude Love vs. WWE Champion Steve Austin - Mr. McMahon had the odds heavily stacked against Austin here with himself as the special referee, Gerald Brisco as the time keeper, and Pat Patterson as the ring announcer who refused to even announce Austin but Undertaker volunteered himself to be the special outside enforcer to make sure Vince called the match fairly. This started off as a normal match with Vince already showing his bias by attempting to quick count Austin early which Austin responded to by knocking Dude Love's new false teeth out of his mouth & stomped on them. They took it to the floor with Austin being thrown into the steps with Vince refusing to count-out Austin since Dude wasn't able to win the title that way only for Dude to continue to attack Austin on the floor causing Vince to change the match to a ""No Disqualification Match."" Austin was able to recover & clothesline Dude over the guardrail & took out Brisco in the process before both men brawled down the isle leading to the match becoming a ""Falls Count Anywhere Match."" The brawled on the cars setup on the stage including one moment where Austin went for a stunner but shoved off the hood of one car onto the hood of another car causing Austin to bleed. The fought back to the ring with a chair getting involved with Dude executing a double DDT & Austin later knocking out Dude with a chairshot to the head with Vince refusing to count only to later pay for it when Vince himself got knocked out with a chair. Chaos followed resulting in Patterson & Brisco getting involved with Taker making each one of them pay for it. This was one of the craziest main events during this time but definitely quality.

[Mick Foley: Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops; Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

Hell In A Cell Match: Mankind vs. Undertaker - You knew this match was going to be special the moment both men started at the top of the cage where they brawled & almost fell through at one point before Mankind was thrown off the top with Jim Ross yelling his now infamous line ""GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY, THAT KILLED HIM! AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, HE'S BROKEN IN HALF!""  The match looked like it was over with Mankind being put on a stretcher with a dislocated shoulder before he decided to go back up only to be chokeslammed through the cage with the chair on top hitting him in the face on the way down.  Taker ended up twisting his ankle coming down from the top as one person who came into the ring to check up on Foley ended up getting chokeslammed out of his shoes before they continued the match with Taker ramming the steps into Mankind's arm multiple times but missed a suicide dive that busted him open allowing Mankind to take advantage using the chair before bringing out a back full of thumbtacks.  This was probably the most famous Hell In The Cell match & the match that launched Mick Foley into wrestling immortality for the beating he took from start to finish.

[Hell In A Cell; Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Best Of King Of The Ring; OMG: Top 50 Moments]

No Disqualification Match: Mankind vs. WWE Champion The Rock - The Rock had The Corporation at ringside while Mankind was declared an ""honorary"" member of D-Generation X as they were in his corner for this match as both men started fighting on the outside with The Rock using the steps on Mankind's back before sandwiching his head between the steps & floor then slamming the other steps on his head.  Both men made their way to the commentary table with both giving their ""play by play"" before Rock took advantage with the Rock Bottom through a table & using the ringbell as well.  Rock continued to use whatever he could get his hands on such as the WWE Title only for Foley to counter & have it come back to bite The Rock as The Corporation would finally get involved resulting in the big brawl with DX with one more observer making his presence felt leading to a moment that was not only big in the career of Mick Foley but also WWE as Monday Night RAW would never get lower ratings than WCW Monday Nitro after this night.

[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary]

Street Fight Match: Cactus Jack vs. WWE Champion Triple H - Knowing how violent this match was going to be, Triple H sent Stephanie to the back before the match started & he was right in doing that as we saw both men target each other's heads in the opening minutes with the steel steps & ring bell being used before a chair was brought into play with Cactus daring Triple H to use it before nailing him with it with Cactus later using the chair to give a legdrop onto Triple H.  The brawl went to the through the crowd & to the stage where Triple H was suplexed onto a wooden pallet that ended up stabbing him in the leg while also taking hits with the steps & a trash can but things really got intense when the barbed wire baseball bat came into play with Foley taking many shots with it to the back while Triple H was a victim of what Jim Ross called ""deadly birth control"" & heavily bleeding from the bat being driven into his face.  The fight once again went back to the outside with the result being the announce table completely covered in blood before Cactus was thrown into & eventually through the steel steps as Triple H was attempting to recreate history from a year earlier with handcuffs & chairs which didn't work out the way he expected as Cactus still fought back including another low blow & unexpected help for Cactus before the fight came back into the ring filled with thumbtacks.  Triple H once said that this was a hardcore war that took fans on a roller coaster of emotions but also told a story as everything used served a purpose & I couldn't agree more as this was the match that definitely put Triple H on the map as a long term main event player.

(Bonus Match) ""Jack"" Foley & Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - This was Foley's first WWE match where he was ""enhancement talent"" against the current WWE Tag Team Champions that was the typical showcase of the Bulldogs at that time that unfortunately resulted in a dislocated jaw.
""Superstars"" Sept. 86

(Bonus Match) Falls Count Anywhere Match: Cactus Jack vs. Sting - These men had an issue with each other dating back months that's been so heated to the point where they didn't even make it to the ring to start the match as Foley attacked Sting on the ramp only for Sting to respond with a backdrop & face plant on the ramp. Cactus focused on the ribs that Sting had previously injured against Vader with moves like the elbow drop off the apron, chairshots to the back & later applying the body scissors. Sting continued to fight Cactus at his own game with fighting on the outside & in the crowd dishing out the punishment like a suplex on the concrete, dishing out his own chairshots, and taking risk like a clothesline off the top rope onto the ramp. This match was what Mick Foley considered the greatest in his career for over 4 years & it was definitely a quality encounter.
The commentary between Foley & Johnathan Coachman talked about various things such as his backstage relationship with Sting, the buildup to this match, and his physical shape being better than what he appeared to be.
WCW Beach Blast 92
[Falls Count Anywhere]

(Bonus Match) Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - The rematch from their first encounter a year earlier with Cactus starting off with brawling with punches & choking Sabu on the ropes before Sabu was able to execute his springboard moonsault but overshot the move landing directly on the rail.  Both men continued to brawl around ringside with Sabu suplexing Cactus on the floor before he gave a receipt on a table that didn't give with Cactus someone ending up with a cut on his forehead as they continued to target each others heads with using a chair.  The match went back on the outside as they fought near the bleachers & stage area back to the ring where a metal trash can was used before Sabu was determined to break an object over Cactus' head no matter how many tries.  This was a better encounter than their first match.
The commentary between Foley & Johnathan Coachman talked about working in ECW, Sabu & Paul Heyman, the moment he knew his body couldn't take that type of punishment anymore, and the story behind where his son Dewey was during this match.
""ECW"" Sept. 94

(Hardcore Edition) Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton - Foley came out under his ""Cactus Jack"" persona & tried to nail Orton with ""Barbie"" right away with Orton running for his life before Orton was able to took nail Mick with a trash can to the face multiple times before Orton eventually ended up taking one himself. They took the fight to the ramp where Foley was back suplexed before going back into the ring where more weapons came into play causing Foley to ask the fans if they wanted him to use either ""Socko"" or ""Barbie"" on Orton. Foley got more violent as he used ""Barbie"" to bust Orton open along with using that to give him a legdrop to the groin. Barbed wire boards, cookie sheets, thumbtacks were all used here along with a moment where Orton was thrown off the stage followed by the classic Cactus Jack elbow drop off the stage onto Orton. Foley in this match did what he did for Triple H in 2000 as he heavily put Orton over in his hardcore environment & showed that he can take some serious punishment that most wrestlers can't & still go while telling a good story in the ring as well.
The alternative commentary between Styles & Foley talked about the difference between this & their previous Mania match, getting into shape for this feud, the amount of concussions he's had over his career, why he left in 2000, and what he took as a personal compliment from the fans in regards to this match.

(Hardcore Edition) Hardcore Match vs. Edge - Edge went on the offense right away using a cookie sheet & even executing a baseball slide into a road sign but it was when he attempted a spear that for some reason hurt himself more than Foley & causing his shoulder to bleed in the process as he revealed a strand of barbed wire wrapped around his waist underneath his flannel shirt.  Foley continued to whip Edge across his bare back with the wire with Lita getting involved only for Foley to do his famous Cactus clothesline over the top rope with Lita on his back going over as well.  They started to brawl on the outside with Foley thrown into the steps more than once & head whipped back onto the ramp before Foley own weapon of ""Barbie"" was used against him.  Edge ended up taking more punishment of his own when he took a drop onto thumbtacks, a barbed wire ""Mr. Socko"" that Lita even felt the effects of, and ""Barbie"" resulting in Edge bleeding before he was able to give a spear to Foley that resulted in not only such a visual but also Mick Foley finally getting his ""WrestleMania Moment.""
The alternative commentary talked about how his relationship with Melina started at this event, his thoughts on Joey Styles calling this match at Mania, what he was most concern about watching the replay, and his wife's reaction after the match.

[Edge: Decade Of Decadence; OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

(Hardcore Edition) w/Edge & Lita vs. Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk, Beulah - It was during this time that Foley had aligned himself with Edge & Lita to the point where they resurrected the retired Hardcore Championship & declared themselves co-champions but this originally scheduled tag match was turned into a six ""person"" tag when Beulah challenged Lita after she kept getting involved in the prior weeks while Foley came into the match with a black eye thanks to Funk & did a funny pre-match promo referring to a period in the history ECW that all the fans truly hated.  All four men started brawling both in the ring & on the floor with various weapons coming into play such as a cookie sheet, Dreamer doing a baseball sliding a trash can into Foley & Dreamer hip tossed onto a ladder by Edge before Funk did his classic airplane spin with the ladder before Foley pulled out a barbed wire board that came into effect as everyone took a hit into this board at one point.  Edge & Foley got very violent using the divide & conquer strategy using the barbed wire to have Funk bleeding from the eye, Dreamer taking ""Barbie"" between the legs, and even Beulah getting a taste of Mr. Socko but they fought back resulting in Foley being on fire with both him & Funk falling into the barbed wire board, Dreamer using the a barbed wire crossface, the traditional ECW ""catfight"" before things ended in a pin attempt that was so sleazy that even the referee went ""what the hell are you doing?""  This match was the EXTREME violence you would expect from a show with the letters ""ECW"" attached to it.
The commentary included his comments on why he was so frustrated going into this match, the fan reaction to his character, how Terry Funk had to prove himself here, the toughness of the women involved, the line he stole from his son during this match, what's the most gruesome thing he's seen, and comparing ECW fans to WWE fans.
ECW One Night Stand '06
[Edge: Decade Of Decadence; ECW: Extreme Rules]

(Hardcore Edition) ""I Quit"" Match vs. Ric Flair - You know where this movie was going when Foley rammed a trash can into the corner on Flair within the first match as Flair also showed that he was going to get just as dirty here when he decided to grab a hand full of Foley before getting hardcore himself chopping him with a barbed wire Mr. Socko.  Flair ended up busted open once Foley used a variety of weapons against him like a barbed wire board, thumbtacks & ""Barbie"" but Flair still came aggressive using ""Barbie"" himself & gave Foley quite a shove that landed him on the outside onto a trash can.  While the match was definitely hardcore with the weapons used & blood shed, it was lacking something (which Foley admitted himself) with the ending shifting the focus towards Foley & his relationship with someone else (which we saw didn't go anywhere past the next night on RAW) making this match overall good for what it was but didn't live up to the intense promos they did.
The commentary here discusses the promos between the two going into the match, why he was not on his game early & lacked aggression early on, the history between him & Flair, and how he was very disappointed with the aftermath of this match.
SummerSlam '06

DVD extras include an interview a week after his match with Vader, the promo where Cactus Jack spits on the WCW Tag Team title, two anti-hardcore ECW promos including his favorite one revolving around a fan making a sign suggesting that Sandman attack his 5 year old son, his ECW farewell speech, a Confidential piece on what he's been up to since leaving WWE in 2001, the early Mankind ""ear"" teaser promos, one of his Mankind vignettes from the ""dungeon"", the promo he did before his Mind Games match, the video features from Las Vegas with Al Snow, and a backstage promo between Commissioner Foley & Kurt Angle. Hidden extras include the video of a young Mick Foley jumping off the roof of his house, the Dude Love entrance video, his Chef Boyardee commercial, and the DX parody ""Have A Bad Day.""

1975452,5,B00016XNRU,"This is one of the best compilation DVD I have brought. Due to the fact that both ECW and WCW are out of business means that some of these matches are very rare. Many people have criticised Foley for being just a gimmick wrestler who can only talk bumps, this maybe true, but his the best at it. Ric Flair used this to attack Foley's legacy in his book, I guess he was writing his book as he bladed himself for the 100,000,000th time. A lot of wrestler today are gimmick wrestler, but Foley is the greatest, far superior to Triple H, Foley made triple h with his rivalries in the summer of 1997 and early 2000.

I suggest you buy this DVD, because it's the best of its kind, providing a great look and a brilliant career. The highlights are:

Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. Nasty Boys: One of the best brawls ever and boy do those Nasty Boys work stiff.

Cactus Jack vs. Sting: Great falls count anywhere matches.

Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels: A classic, one of the few great matches to have a DQ finish, can anybody guess where the undertaker is.

Cactus Jack vs. HHH: Foley made Hunter.

Dude Love vs. Steve Austin: A great match, I wish they had put a few promos leading up to this match, including when the Dude accused Austin of being a player hater.

Mankind vs. The Undertaker: This is just brutal; I find it difficult to watch. One of the most important matches ever.

Cactus Jack vs. Triple H: Foley makes Triple H.

It's not a perfect collection, it should have Mankind vs. HHH (Steel Cage Match - SS1997), Mankind vs. The Rock (I Quit Match RR1999) & I would love to see Mankind vs. The Rock at the super bowl half time show and Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk in a Barb-wired match from Japan.

Overall, buy this now the only essential hardcore wrestling DVD.",1143331200,,1763,4.347560975609756
1975453,5,B00016XNRU,"I wanted this DVD so much when it first came out and when i got it was surprised just how good the matches were on this DVD in their full length.

WCW

Cactus Jack Vs. Big Van Vader - A brutal brawl like no other, Cactus takes a horrible beating and hearing Vader break his nose is just sick. You see unseen footage not shown in WCW of Cactus being busted open and the ending which is a surprise brilliant battle. 8.5/10

Chicago Street Fight

Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys - My favourite tag match ever!! Who could have thought WCW could have put on such a violent match in 1994!! Alot like ECW with the use of lots of weapons and tables. (Watch out for some nasty chair shots and Cactus being pushed off ramp onto cold concrete!) 10/10

SMW

Cactus Jack vs Chris Candido (RIP) - For some reason i never liked this match and didn't get into it even though it is a decent technical affair, Cactus shows he isn't just a hardcore wrestler. 5/10

ECW

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - This match had way too much hype going into and was never going to deliver to its full anticipation. Like Mick says most people expected him and Sabu to kill each other in this match and people were bound to be dissapointed. This said i think this match is a good hardcore bout with both taking some good bumps and hits. 8/10

Texas Death Match

Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman - One of the misses on the DVD and a very wierd match. Sandman is mainly a brawler who can put on a good hardcore match but he was out of it for this match so it was all Cactus and the ending was messed up alot of times by the fact Sandman didn't know what to do, hard to watch at times but some good weapon spots. 5/10 (For the good weapons and Sandman continuing even though not really there in mind)

Cactus Jack and Raven vs. Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer - What we all remember ECW for! Best match on DVD for ECW and was what we all expect it to be. Weapons everywhere (Even a VCR!!)and just an all out brawl to remember, finish was a little messy  but doesnt ruin the match. 9/10

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck -His last match in ECW and second best match ive seen Whipwreck in (No. 1 is against Billy Kidman Uncensored 2000)this match was good and solid with some good spots from both men.

WWE/WWF

WWE Title

Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels - Brilliant best match of 1996 and didn't even have a proper storyline to back it up. This match proves that Mick is not just a hardcore wrestler who brawls but is someone who can put on a good technical match with someone like HBK. Brilliant but deserved a proper ending. 9.5/10 (Would have been 10 but for the run in)

Falls Count Anywhere

Cactus Jack vs. HHH - Classic Raw match which was the turning point into the attitude era and a more aggressive style. Good match which goes throughout the arena and the ending is excellent, the first match between HHH and Cactus who always seem to work well together. 9/10

No Holds Barred

Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk - Only match on DVD as Mick Foley. A ok solid match but it felt like the crowd didn't care until near the end. 6/10

WWE Title

Dude Love vs. Stone Cold (c) - Only match as Dude Love but is a good example of the infamous attitude era. Good brawl and Vince McMahon and Undertaker help this match along. 8/10

Hell In A Cell

Mankind vs. Undertaker - WOW most famous Hell In A Cell match ever and most fans have seen many times. You all know that Mick takes some crazy bumps and both give their all in this brilliant and brutal match, Undertaker had a broken foot and Mick was messed up aftr the fall from the top so to create such a match from that makes this a classic. 10/10

WWE Title

Mankind vs. The Rock (c) - Micks first title win shame it had to be on Raw. This is not the best match these two have had but was a decent match with lots of interference. 7/10

Street Fight WWE Title

Cactus Jack vs. HHH (c) - WHAT A MATCH! Best street fight ever! This match is full of weapons and blood and they put their all in this match. HHH and Cactus were at their best here and put on a performance that keeps you on the edge of your seat BRILLIANT! 10/10

  A+ = 94.40 - 100%-DVD of the century, must buy and keep in a very safe place.

There are lots of matches on this DVD so I will do them in the order I watched them.

Match One-WCW-Cactus Jack Vs Big Van Vader-This was one of many matches on this DVD where Foley gets busted open. Vader is an alright wrestler but people give him no credit. This match is from Foleys home collection and its unedited as it wasn't allowed to have the blood which was shed on the television. Not a classic match but still a fairly good one and a good way to start off this DVD with some good kicks and thrills. My rating 6.75/10.

Match Two-WCW-Chicago Street Fight-Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne Vs The Nasty Boys-Cactus wasn't actually going to wrestle this match as he was meant to get a new ear attached. This match lived up to its name as it was four men going at it in a brutal street fight with lots of weapons and a decent amount of high spots and bumps. Cactus Jack works so hard in this match and bumps non stop and proves how great he is. The Nasty Boys who are normally sloppy did a good solid performance which was good for everyone especially them. Maxx Payne dominated at times but at other times was destroyed. Overall this a good match as all four wrestlers put in a great performance. This is a recommended watch for any of these wrestlers fans or any person who is into brawls and fights. My rating 6.95/10.

Match Three-ECW-Cactus Jack Vs Sabu-This was the first meeting between these two to try determine the king of hardcore. This match wasn't for a title, it wasn't for money, it was for pride. Sabu may not speak much english but he sure makes up for that in the ring. Cactus did an awesome performance and together they produced many great exciting thrills with lots of pops which kept me on the edge of my seat. They kept going at it at one hundred and ten percent all the time. The match consisted of a lot of aerial manuevers which were absolutely spectacular and amazed me non stop. The ending was a shocking way to end such a great match. This match was heading for a really high mark but the ending put it down a little. This is a must watch for anyone though. My rating 7.94/10.

Match Four-Smoky Mountain Wrestling-Cactus Jack Vs Chris Candido-Cactus cuts a ripper of a promo on Candido before this match. This was a good match with Candido playing the scared of Cactus person. That gave Cactus an idea for Mankind in the WWE. Candido puts his body on the line all the time and that was no different in this match. An abrubt ending was alright except then there was a post match beatdown on Cactus Jack. My rating 6.50/10.

Match Five-ECW-Texas Death Match-Cactus Jack Vs The Sandman-The rules of this match are you have to pin your oponent for a three count then they have to remain knocked down for a ten count. Cactus and Sandman both pulled out all the stocks in this match to keep the other one down. Lots of finishers and high flying Cactus action which is awesome to see and watch. This was an absolute train wreck to watch but it is worth it,as its a good match to see. Good solid brutal ending which helped this match along its way. Sandman and Cactus both take a lot of hits but neither one of them give up. My rating 6.81/10.

Match Six-ECW-Raven & Cactus Jack Vs Tommy Dreamer & Terry Funk-This had a kind of slow start but once they settled in it was absolute hardcore wrestling with lots of weapons with the good old cheese grater being used. Raven and Jack start of with total domination of the ring but it quickly slides and breaks out in a bloody brawl. A bin is emptyed on stage containing weapons from cheese graters to shovels and trolleys. Steven Richards makes a suprise appearance but Funk and Dreamer make short work of him. All four wrestlers come out wearing the crimson mask and are badly messed. A hardcore performance from all participators and a great match overall. My rating 8.17/10.

Match Seven-ECW-Cactus Jack Vs Mikey Whipwreck-This was a good solid match by both wrestlers with it being Jacks last match in ECW. This was an awesome performance by both men with lots of good thrills and spots that entertained endlessly. Cactus makes anyone look good and everyone knows that. This had great sportsmanship after this match and it was very great to watch. My rating 6.12/10.

Match Eight-WCW-Cactus Jack Vs Sting-This was one of the extras on disc one with alternate commentary from Coach and Foley himself. There was some awesome bumps which were really entertaining especially when Sting misses a jumping splash and nails his manhood on the toprope!!!!!! Cactus may not have been as good as Sting then but he never gave up. Sting though he was slightly better then Cactus produced a good solid hardcore match with a ordinary ending but this match was still good. Lots of action in this match going all round ringside. My rating 6.70/10.

Match Nine-ECW-Sabu Vs Cactus Jack-This was the rematch, again no titles on the line, no money on the line, just two great hardcore wrestlers going at it for pride. It was a good match except there was two intruders interfering and costing Jack some time and energy. Sabu gets stuffed up on a table spot and so did Jack it was great all round. Hopefully they have lots more matches between these two as the matches have been absolutely excellent. My rating 7.82/10.

Match Ten-WWE-Jack Foley & Les Thornton Vs The British Bulldogs-This was Foleys WWE TV Debut and it was against two great tag team wrestlers who are very experienced. This was your typical tag team match with no real high spots but it was still good for Foleys debut. My rating 6.71/10.

Match Eleven-WWE-WWE Title-Shawn""HBK""Michaels(C)Vs Mankind-This was the first of many matches from his time in WWE. It was a very entertaining match with lots of thrills,spills and your dose of Sunday Night pills. These two worked non stop and produced a great match. The ending was very bad and it made this match seem a little less good. My rating 9.56/10.

Match Twelve-WWE-Falls Count Anywhere Match-HHH Vs Cactus Jack-This was a match against HHH where all of Foleys egos appeared on the Titantron. This was a good match from both athletes and the ending was absolutely spectacular. My rating 8.98/10.

Match Thirteen-WWE-No Holds Barred-Mick Foley Vs Terry Funk-This was a battle which was set up by Vince McMahon to get two best friends to try destroy each other. Lots of action spilling everywhere around the arena. Stone Cold was at ringside making his presence. This was a good solid match. My rating 8.62/10.

Match Fourteen-WWE-WWE Title-Stone Cold Steve Austin(C)Vs Dude Love-This was an awesome match with lots of bumps and the added stipulation of No DQ Falls Count Anywhere. There was lots of surprises like Undertaker chokeslamming both Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco through seperate announcer tables. This was an awesome brawl with Austin juicing badly. Good solid ending just describing what was needed. My rating 9.34/10.

Match Fifteen-WWE-Hell In The Cell-Mankind Vs Undertaker-Mankind took an awful beating and got bloodied up bad and had teeth everywhere. Many major high spots like getting thrown off the cage and then through it. There was lots of weapons used with a great ending and both men were bleeding bad by the end of this dramatic match. My rating 9.10/10.

Match Sixteen-WWE-WWE Title-Rock(C)Vs Mankind-This had the Corporation on the Rocks side and DX on Mankinds side. It had lots of interference and a good ending and it was a good match. My rating 8.36/10.

Match Seventeen-WWE-Street Fight-WWE Title-HHH(C)Vs Cactus Jack-This was an absolute bloody mess of a match. Both men put in 110% out there and it showed with lots of bumps and spots. There was so much good about this match and it was awesome to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat non stop. My rating 9.89/10.

This DVD has lots of great extras as well as these great matches and it is awesome to watch. In conclusion this DVD is well worth your money and should be bought for anyone. The score for this DVD was 134.32 out of 170 which is a good score. The percentage for this is 79.01% which in my grading system is a B+. This DVD is awesome and it is am must have and its well worth your money. I hope this helps you. Feel free to check out my otehr reviews.",1120003200,2,9627,4.550724637681159

 vs Vader Wcw Saturday Night 4.17.93- Not a very good match. I don't like Vader at all. It's cool to see Foley pick him up off the top rope. Foley wins by countout. Match Rating 5

 & Maxx Payne vs The Nasty boys Wcw Spring Stampede 4.17.94- Ok match for it's time. They mostly use chairs, pool que, shovel, and a table. I like when Cactus suplexs the table onto one of the Nasty boys. Nasty Boys win. Match Rating 6

 vs The Sandman Texas Death Match ECW 2.4.95- This is a last man standing match but, before the refree starts the count you have to get a three count. Ok match. Sandman takes so many DDTs on the concrete. Foley says he was knocked out so he wouldn't stay down. Foley wins. Match Rating 4

 vs Mikey Whipwreck ECW Big Ass Extreme Bash- Foley's last match at ECW. It was a good exiting match. The table wouldn't break win foley suplex him into it. They go through the crowd and foley wins this one. Match Rating 7.5

Foley's WWE days now. Now Mankind's opponets shown below.

 vs Shawn Michaels Mind Games WWE Championship  9.22.96- Awesome match. Great phsycology between this two. They should have had a rematch cause Vader got involved which was the only bad thing about this match because it got Foley DQed. Nice suplex against the stairs. For some reason that is my favorite move out of that whole match. Foley says he thinks this is his best match ever and I agree with him. I think it is better than the HIAC vs Undertaker. Best match on the discs. Shawn wins by DQ. Match

Rating 10

 vs HHH Raw 9.22.97- Mankind had a Excellent promo before the match introducing Cactus Jack. Nice match especially to be on Raw. HHH in his pre-days. Foley wins with a piledriver through a table on the stage. Match Rating 9.5

 vs Terry Funk Raw 5.4.98- Good match but it is sort of like the one above but the other one is better. This drags for the last 7 minutes or so. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this match. Foley wins to become the NO.1 contender for the WWE title. Match Rating 7.5

 vs Stone Cold WWE Championship Over the Edge 5.31.98- Good match. This was a nearly 25 minutes and it was great. They were exchaging rights at the begining and then it picks up. They go down the runway and Foley backdrops Austin onto a car. Its great. Then they go back to the ring ref is down Brisco tries to count but, then Taker chokeslams him through an annouce table. Then Patterson tries to count but, Taker then chokeslams him through a table as well. Austins wins. Match Rating 9

 vs Undertaker HIAC Kotr 6.28.98- The match that Foley got made famous by. Great match. They start on the top then Foley goes crashing through an annouce table of the cell. Then he goes back up for more. He gets chokeslammed through the cell this time. Undertaker wins. Match Rating 9

 vs The Rock WWE Championship Raw 1.4.99- They put this on there cause Foley wins the Championship. Good NO DQ title match. DX is there to make sure the Corporation doesn't interfere and they did there job because Foley walked away with the title that night. Match Rating 8

 vs HHH WWE Championship Royal Rumble Street Fight 1.23.00- Great match. First time I saw I got shivers cause some of the pain Foley takes in this match. Trips leg gets cut open on the wooden pallet. Its nasty. Trips wins with a pedigree on the tacks. Match Rating 10

1975457,4,B00016XNRU,"NOTE: All matches within the body of both discs of the 2 DVD set are complete (ie: unedited) & introduced well by Mick himself. Some of the introductions also include fascinating promos or interviews.

vs BIG VAN VADER (April '93): This television bout is from 'WCW Saturday Night'. Vader was the heel World Champion at the time & Cactus got a big countout win in this 10 minute (excluding commercial time) brawl. And it most definitely was a brawl, as Vader just pummeled Foley over & over with legitimate punches & forearm shots. There was the occasional wrestling move, but not a lot. There is also a lot of outside the ring action. Note that the family friendly WCW version is mixed with Mick's uncensored personal footage. Match Rating...6

with MAXX PAYNE vs THE NASTY BOYS (April '94): This was a 'Chicago Streetfight' at the 'Spring Stampede' pay-per-view, and took place not long after Mick lost his ear. No tags here, as it was predominantly two sets of 1 on 1 matches taking place all over the arena, and very rarely in the ring. Fairly fun to watch, but nothing too hardcore or special. And don't even think about any psychology being used here. It's simply prop shot after prop shot. Foley gets pinned at the 9 minute mark after a shovel shot to the head. This type of match later became synonymous with WCW's Uncensored ppv. Match Rating...6

vs SABU (June '94): This bout was from the ECW 'Hostile City Showdown' event & Foley was basically on loan from WCW at the time. In his intro, Mick explains why he didn't show any offense in the first 4 minutes. Unfortunately, that ploy didn't really work & threw the match off kilter a little. When Mick did finally fight back, it turned into the prototypical early ECW style bout. Extremely spotty, yet not a drop of blood was seen. Nowhere near their best match, but still a fascinating watch. Sabu wins at the 13 minute mark with help from Paul E. A 6 minute aftermath is included & helps get the rating up a notch... Match Rating...7

vs CHRIS CANDIDO (November '94): Terrific match from Smokey Mountain Wrestling with an excellent performance by Candido (who I had previously only seen as Skip, or was it Zip, in the WWE). Unfortunately, it's only 8 minutes in length, but the action is non-stop for that entire duration. It's also a great mix of technical & aerial wrestling, with a little hardcore action thrown in. Cactus wins with his patented double arm DDT. I'll be a little kind on the rating due to Candido's surprising all-around talent & the length of the match. Match Rating...8

vs THE SANDMAN (February '95): This was an ECW 'Texas Death Mach', which is basically a 'Last Man Standing' match, except you have to get a 3 count pinfall before the 10 count (if that makes sense). In his intro, Foley admits this isn't a great bout (saying he didn't choose it for the DVD), but notes that he & Sandman were both badly injured during the match. I just thought Sandman was drunk or stoned, rather than concussed. A bit of a mess & more like an ECW undercard bout, than a main event match. Still fascinating in some strange sort of way though. Cactus wins with 3 DDTs to the floor at the 16 minute mark of this too slowly paced bout. Match Rating...5

with RAVEN vs TERRY FUNK & TOMMY DREAMER (November '95): This was from the ECW 'November 2 Remember' show & is preceded by a Foley story of setting Funk on fire, which almost made Mick quit wrestling. Simply put, this is a 14 minute prop-fest. Name an object & it's used as a weapon here. There are far too many to name. Everyone hits, everyone gets hit, everyone bleeds, everyone has fun... I think. Not exactly my cup of tea, but the pace was kept up & it included a hilarious moment when Dreamer pulled Foley's shirt, which had a picture of Eric Bischoff on it, to head level, just so he could pummel it over & over again. No real wrestling or selling is anywhere to be seen. Match Rating...6

vs MIKEY WHIPWRECK (March '96): This bout was from the ECW 'Big Ass Extreme Bash' show & was Mick Foley's last ECW match. In the intro, Mick actually admits that the cheers from the crowd during this bout may have been his most memorable moment ever! Solid match which I think best sums up ECW. There was a decent mix of hardcore, high-flying, brawling & technical wrestling for the 18 minute duration. There was also a good 'never-say-die' feel from both competitors, as it genuinely appeared like they were both striving to get an important win. Cactus ended up leaving ECW victorious. Match Rating...7

POST VADER MATCH INTERVIEW: Decent little interview including Jack mentioning turning face & using his family to help the turn along.

vs STING (June '92): This is from WCW's 'Beach Blast' show & was a 'Falls Count Anywhere' match. It also has voiceover commentary from Mick himself & Jonathan Coachman. This is a gem of an 11 minute match. Most of the encounter takes place outside of the ring, but that actually helps these 2. It's difficult to explain, but the 2 play off of each other really well & their styles mesh superbly. Non-stop action & a whole bunch of great moves, without being too spotty. It's also easy to see why Sting was destined for big things as a youngster; There is just an electricity about him here. A forgotten gem. Match Rating...9

CACTUS SPITS ON THE WCW BELT: Terrific & classic ECW promo relating to the Sabu feud. It was actually conducted at the time Mick was on loan from WCW & that played heavily in the promo. This extra also includes a Paul Heyman interview as well.

""CANE DEWEY"" PROMO: Mick introduces this well. Truly one of the greatest promos ever! Directed at Tommy Dreamer, Foley uses a crowd sign to deliver an emotional speech which difficultly is 100% heel. Using the fans, ECW & WCW, Cactus hits absolutely every correct nerve. Sensational.

""ANTI HARDCORE"" PROMO: Another excellent 8 minute promo in the same vein as the last one, but a bit more specific towards Tommy Dreamer. This time Foley uses some of his own history, as well as Dreamer's.

vs SABU (September '94): This also includes commentary from Mick & The Coach. The ECW rematch, this is pretty much more of the same, except it's a tad longer because a break is needed not long after the start of the bout, because Sabu almost kills himself on the guardrail. Entertaining, as per usual, with Sabu's spots & Mick's craziness. Includes some wicked glass bottle shots to Mick's head, and this is definitely real glass! Match Rating...7

ECW FAREWELL SPEECH: Heartfelt speech thanking the ECW fans & putting over ECW as a possible future threat to the big 2, with great people involved in it.

with LES THORNTON vs THE BRITISH BULLDOGS (September '86): The second ever Cactus Jack match is introduced by Mick & is from the 'WWF Superstars' television show. I have to be honest & say that I was being far too much of a Bulldogs fan to worry about what a young & skinny Mick was doing here. Usual 'Superstars' squash that lasted less than 4 minutes. I won't rate it, but watching the Bulldogs was great fun.

WWE CONFIDENTIAL FEATURE: Ok 6 minute feature detailing Mick's 19 month absence from the WWE, what he did during that time & how he felt upon return.

EASTER EGGS:

DUDE LOVE VIGNETTE: On Disk-1, go to the 'Chapters' menu & highlight 'Cactus Jack vs Chris Candido'. Then press 'right' twice to see a 1 minute long Dude Love vignette.

FOLEY'S FIRST LEAP: On Disk-1, go to the 'Extras' menu & highlight 'Main Menu'. Then press 'left' twice to see the infamous footage of Foley jumping off the roof of a house as a teenager. I'd actually never seen the ""busted wide open"" ending before.

NOTE: Before we get into the matches, Mick introduces the Mankind character by talking about Vince's idea & that stinky mask. We also see an excellent introductory vignette including George The Rat.

vs SHAWN MICHAELS (September '96): Foley calls this his ""greatest match ever"". Taking place at the 'Mind Games' pay-per-view, this is a truly superb match which proved that HBK could get the job done in the ring against practically any type of opponent. On his DVD, Shawn said that Mick's style gave him the opportunity to do something a little different & show the fans something new in his matches. I think it's probably the best ever mix of 2 different styles in the 1 bout. Intense, well-paced & very psychological, the Disqualification ending (Vader running in) is the only real low point of this bout. Match Rating...10

vs TRIPLE H (September '97): This is a 'Falls Count Anywhere' match from Raw. This was the WWE arrival of Cactus Jack & was introduced by a great 3 character promo by Foley. Entertaining ECW style match with a great array of spots all over the arena. Worked a treat & the fans really got involved. Excluding commercial time, this was 10 minutes in duration. Practically a pay-per-view main event on free television. Match Rating...9

vs TERRY FUNK (May '98): 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin guest commentates on this Raw 'Falls Count Anywhere' match where Mick wrestled as himself. Slower paced hardcore bout which took a real long time to get going. But these 2 worked extremely hard to make it very much worthwhile after all was said & done. Nothing special, but as a television match, this was more than sufficient. Excluding commercial time, this lasted 15 minutes. Match Rating...7

vs 'STONE COLD' STEVE AUSTIN (May '98): From the 'Over The Edge' ppv, Vince McMahon was the special guest referee, but The Undertaker was at ringside to make sure he did his job properly. This is one of those rare times where gimmicky overbooking actually helps the bout a little. I get the feeling a couple of times during this match that Foley & Austin are attempting to replicate the 'Mind Games' HBK bout, but it's very much a poor man's version. But with help from gimmicky ringside props (especially 2 cars) & various Vince/Brisco/Patterson shenanigans, we get what is a very good all-around entertainment package. Stone Cold wins by pinfall at the 23 minute mark when he lifts Vince's unconscious hand up & down for the 3 count. Match Rating...8

vs THE UNDERTAKER (June '98): This is the infamous 'Hell In A Cell' match from the 'King Of The Ring' ppv. In his intro, Foley states that when it comes to the memory of fans, what he did in this match pretty much overshadows everything else he did. It's really hard to argue with that opinion, as I know his 2 huge bumps will forever be etched in my mind. I actually wouldn't have minded the match ending at the 1 minute mark, as the commentary table spot has to be seen to be believed. How Foley survived that & the subsequent mat bump, which genuinely knocked him out for a little while, is amazing. And to think that after all that, an actual match took place..... including thumbtacks! I'll say it was 18 minutes in total, although I can't actually recall when the opening bell rang. Almost impossible to rate, as it's hardly a wrestling match. Entertaining in a rather sadistic sort of way & really has to be seen to be believed. Match Rating...9

vs THE ROCK (January 1999): This is the Raw 'No Disqualification' bout where Mick (as Mankind) won the WWE Championship. Nothing really special about the match, except that Foley caused the huge upset & won the title. It works as a television bout with that upset win & a huge ending (where Stone Cold comes out & clocks Rocky with a chair). However, I have to be honest, and state that it would only just scrape a pass rating on pay-per-view (especially without a Foley win). Still, the match had to be on this 2 disk DVD set & is fun to view. At only 9 minutes in length, it needs the entertaining celebrations afterwards to cap it off. A generous rating for this television bout. Match Rating...7

vs TRIPLE H (January 2000): This is the 'Streetfight' from the 2000 'Royal Rumble' ppv. 27 minutes of brutal hardcore action. But to call this just a ""hardcore"" match is not giving it enough credit. It was intense, pretty much non-stop & very hard hitting. Hell, it even told a story. Make no mistake that this was the moment that truly elevated Triple H to a main event superstar. Complete with thumbtacks, chairs & a barbed-wire covered 2x4, this match had it all. Probably fairly easy to find faults when viewed under a microscope, but the entertainment value was too high to do that. A classic. Match Rating...10

4 MANKIND TEASERS: All are short snippets at about 20 seconds each & focus on Mick's bad ear.

MUSIC TO MY EAR: Another Mankind introduction vignette, this one focusing on his injured hand & how he used to be a concert pianist!

MIND GAMES: A Jim Ross in-ring interview of Mankind before his 'Mind Games' title shot.

JIM ROSS INTERVIEWS MANKIND: A sit-down interview where Foley shows a human side to his heel Mankind character. Again, Mick walks a tightrope with this promo & gets safely to the other end. Of course, it all ends in JR getting the mandible claw.

THE BIRTH OF MR SOCKO: The hilarious skit where Mick & his clown friend try to cheer an injured Vince McMahon up in hospital. Does not show the Austin ending.

MICK & AL SNOW IN VEGAS: Short skit of Mick & Al wandering around a casino getting heckled by a Rock fan.

MORE MICK & AL SNOW IN VEGAS: Pretty much the same again, but this time a gentlemen's club gets involved.

COMMISSIONER FOLEY & KURT ANGLE: Short little backstage segment which pretty much sums up Mick's face commissioner run. It includes his nonsensical booking of a match & the usual cheap hometown pop.

EASTER EGGS:

CHEF BOYARDEE COMMERCIAL: On Disk-2, go to the 'Chapters' menu & highlight 'HBK vs Mankind'. Then press 'left' twice to see Mick's Chef Boyardee television advertisement.

DX's ""HAVE A BAD DAY"" SKIT: On Disk-2, go to the 'Extras' menu & highlight 'The Birth Of Mr Socko'. Then press 'right' twice to see a DeGeneration X comedy skit entitled 'Have A Bad Day', where a rather thin Mankind goes to the unemployment office to be berated by Triple H.

WCW Saturday Night 4-17-93

Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader

Just blatantly brutal and stiff.  Not the most exciting match but fun to look back on.  Should've put in Halloween Havoc match also.  Foley's nose breaking is great.

Spring Stampede 4-17-94

Chicago Street Fight

Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys

Awesome match!  Definitely ahead of its time by 4-5 years.  Action everywhere and some big bumps and hard shots to the head.

ECW Hostile City Showdown 6-24-94

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu

Hyped as a dream match it doesn't live up to that hype but does live up to being a fun match.  Two men willing to do anything to themselves.

Smokey Mountain Wrestling 11-18-94

Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido

Funny promo before the match!  It's really cool to look back at this now.  Especially with JR doing commentary.  This kind of down home wrestling doesn't really exist anymore.  Not too bad of a match but it is old school style.

ECW Texas Death Match 2-4-95

Cactus Jack vs. Sandman

Foley himself said this match stinks,(not in so many words) but I like it.  Sandman is a zombie but still has the intuition to try to finish the match.  He screws with the finish but only because he didn't know where he was! Cool match.

ECW November 2 Remember 11-18-95

Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer

Amazing!  I miss this kind of wrestling on a regular basis.  They literally use EVERYTHING!  Non-stop action makes this the second best match on the whole set!

ECW Big Ass Extreme Bash 3-9-96

Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck

Foley's farewell in ECW on my 17th birthday!  I remember watching this and thinking about where his career would go!  Great send off here and Mikey's best performance ever.

Cactus Jack vs. Sting

I wish they used the original commentary.  Great match with some good wrestling by Foley and of course the always reliable Sting.

Cactus Jack vs. Sabu

The rematch.  Probably better than the first.

""Jack"" Foley & Les Thornton vs. The British Bulldogs

Hilarious to watch now!  He was so thin back then!

Disc 2

WWF Championship 9-22-96

Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels

The absolutely underrated classic!  Not many people know about this match at all and it's a shame.  They had no feud going into this and still got the crowd involved.  Both men have this high on their list in their careers so that tells you something.

Falls Count Anywhere/No DQ 9-22-97

Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley

Pre-HHH persona and it's great to look at now.  Awesome Raw match and the big return of Cactus.  Crowd reaction and preceding promo is perfection!

WWF Championship Falls Count Anywhere 5-4-98

Dude Love vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin

Great brawl.  Another unheralded gem.  Attitude era classic.

Hell in a Cell 6-28-98

Mankind vs. Undertaker

THE match.  Any fan worth their salt has seen this a hundred times over and still gets chills.  What can you say?  You can't comprehend the pain that Foley must've been in for the weeks following this.  Another fact is that he still did his run-in in the main event!!

WWF Championship No DQ 1-4-99

Mankind vs. The Rock

A pretty good match and the return of SCSA make this a RAW classic!  15 years had finally paid off for the hardest working man in wrestling.

Fantastic way to bring his career full circle!  Incredible match and the top 5 all time greatest street fights.  This made HHH the star he is now.

Extras(matches)

Mick does commentary with the coach for the rematch with Sabu and against Sting. The commentary is funny. There's mickfoley's second career tag match with him teaming with Less Thortan v British Bulldogs. This is not a dud because it has some good wrestling moves

Disk 2.

V Shawn Michaels, 1996 - some hardcore wrestling and technical wrestling.

V HHH - A great short match.

V 53 year old Terry Funk - They were both killing each other in this with vile chair shots and piledrivers.

V Stone Cold - great match. The closeline is the best bit.

V Undertaker, Hell in a cell - This is why I bought the DVD. Unless you seen the 4 main highlights this is unpredictable. A stupid thing is there are videos of mick foleys entrance music on the options menu and it'll spoil what happens in this match. Mankind nearly killed himself and the people who thinks wrestling is fake should watch this.

V Rock, Raw is War, this is entertaining for a short match. Some funny stuff and the actors know how to keep a straight face and not laugth.

3. Cactus Jack Manson Vs. Vader - Vader is the LAST guy you want to let smack you around, but Cactus does it. This is a TV match that has un-shown footage. Pretty brutal match **

4. Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne Vs. The Nasty Boys - Streetfight - An ECW match years before ECW. They brawl all over the place with every weapon they can find. Forget those wimpy tin-foil trashcans that WWF used, this is all super-stiff shots. Should've also had the Sullivan/Cactus Vs. Nasty Boys match to bookend this with. *****

It is a great, 2 disc DVD packed with some of Mick's greatest matches.  One of the interesting things about this DVD is that Mick Foley talks about every single match before they show it.  On a side note, I knew this DVD was coming out last October because I went to a conference at my old college and Mick was there.  We attended the same college.

Disc 1: WCW/ECW Days

1. Cactus Jack vs. Big Van Vader (WCW Saturday Night 4/17/1993)

Very cool to see Mick wrestling in the WCW.  When this originally aired a lot of the footage was cut out because of the blood, but Mick had another copy.  Good match.  (8.5/10)

2. Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne vs. The Nasty Boys (WCW Spring Stampede 1994 - Chicago Street Fight)

Very entertaining match.  This is probably one of the first hardcore matches that people laid there eyes.  Again, very entertaining, hard fought match.  (9/10)

3. Cactus Jack vs. Sabu (ECW Hostile City Showdown 6/24/94)

This match was being billed as a dream match because of the legendary hardcore status of the two competitors.  It may have been a bit of a let down, but still produced a good contest.  (9/10)

4. Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido (Smoky Mountain Wrestling (11/18/1994)

It is pretty interesting to see a match from this federation.  There is nothing to special in the match, but it is a decent contest.  (8/10)

5. Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman (2/4/1995 - Texas Death Match)

This particular match took place in ECW.  It is pretty crazy what happens in the match.  I don't want to give it away.  Mick explains what happens and it is easy to notice.  (8.5/10)

6. Cactus Jack & Raven vs. Terry Funk & Tommy Dreamer (ECW November 2 Remember 11/18/1995)

Good ol' hardcore tag team wrestling match.  They literally use everything in this match, but the kitchen sink.  All 4 competitors really go at it in hardcore fashion.  Great match.  As always the ECW fans were really into the match.  (9/10)

7. Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck (ECW Big Ass Extreme Bash 3/9/1996)

This was Mick's last match in ECW before moving to WWE and becoming Mankind.  Very entertaining match.  Mikey Whipwreck does not look like a wrestler, but man can this kid perform.  Good match.  (9/10)

Disc 1 Extras:  This disc contains a lot of Mick's favorite promos.  Watch them, but make sure you see Mick explain them ahead of time.  There are two matches on the bonus features as well.

1. Cactus Jack vs. Sting (WCW Beach Blast 6/20/1992 - WCW Heavyweight Title)

This was a good match.  It is a little annoying because The Coach and Foley do commentary over the match.  There has to be a way to take it off, although I haven't figured how.  Good match nonetheless. (8.5/10)

2. Cactus Jack vs. Sabu (9/30/1994)

This was the rematch from their previous match that was on the DVD.  Sabu takes a major chance in this match and gets real banged up.  Decent match.  Would have been better had Sabu not hurt himself.  (8.5/10)

Disc 2: WWF Years

1. Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels (Mind Games 9/22/1996 - WWF Title)

Great match.  HBK calls this one of his greatest matches of all time.  It may be Mick's best match ever when it comes to pure wrestling.  There is a little bit of everything in this match.  Watch the two competitors go through the table and watch Vince get involved and try to stop the match.  Appearances are made by Vader, Sid Vicous, and The Undertaker.  (9/10)

2. Cactus Jack vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley (RAW 9/22/1997 - Falls Count Anywhere)

This was the first and one of the few matches Foley ever wrestled as Cactus Jack in the WWE.  It is one of my personal favorites.  The match is at Madison Sqaure Garden, which makes it even more exciting.  Good bump taken by Hunter.  (9.5/10)

3. Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk (RAW 5/4/1998 - No Holds Barred)

Good match.  It is fun to see Funk and Foley go at it.  Terry Funk pulls off a sick moonsault of one the entrance ways in the arena.  (9/10)

4. Dude Love vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Over The Edge 5/31/1998 - WWF Title)

Fantastic match.  The crowd was really into this match.  There are twists and turns from the get go.  This is not a match you here a lot about, but it is a great match.  (9/10)

5. Mankind vs. Undertaker (King of the Ring 1998 - Hell In A Cell)

This may be the most single infamous match in the history of the WWE.  Foley falls off the cell, through the cell, and gets chokeslammed onto nails.  This man is insane.  (10/10)

6. Mankind vs. The Rock (RAW 1/4/1999 - WWF Title)

Not the best match, but it is on here for historical perspectives.  Very strong finish.  There are unlimited appearances by other wrestlers in this match.  (8/10)

7. Cactus Jack vs. Triple H (Royal Rumble 2000 - WWF Title/Street Fight)

Madison Square Garden hosted this event.  Their crowds are the best.  Another one of my favorites.  These two took the idea of a ""Street Fight"" to a whole new level.  One of my favorite matches ever and one of the best ""Street Fights"" you will see.  (10/10).

As far the extras for disc 2, there is really nothing that stands out.

1975466,5,B00016XNRU,"I didn't really know just how much Mick Foley really went through untill i bought this DVD. I was really surprised and instantly became a bigger fan of him when I was done. Mick Foley truly is a hardcore legend and anyone who is a fan of hardcore wrestling should buy this DVD.

The two disk set includes matches from ECW, WCW, and WWE. Theres even a match from SMW in the first disk. While I like his matches from WWE a lot it was the first disk that had the WCW and ECW matches that got my attention. His match with the Nasty Boys was one of the better ones and the tag match against Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer was great with all the weapons. Litterally anything you could think off they used or did to hurt each other. The Sabu match was allright, but the extras had the rematch in it so it made up for that.

  There is also an extra match against sting which is good only because of mick's commentary during it. the worst matches would have to be him vs. the sandman[just skip this match] and him vs. vader {i fell asleep} They also should have shown matches of him when he was in japan but i guess they were too brutal, whatever......

The best matches on the WWE disk would be:

Him against Terry funk when he wrestled as mick Foley[stone cold was hilarious during the match], Lots of chairs, tables, and even beer was used in this one.

mankind vs. the undertaker[just because of the falls mick takes off the cage], This was also when Mankind used thumbtacks in a hell in the cell match, the only time I think too. A match that earned by ultimate respect.

and Cactus Jack vs. Triple H at the royal rumble 2000. This match was unbelievable and Mick Foley even gets pedigreed on thumbtacks! Wow, what a match!

 Shawn michaels vs. mankind is good too but that match is on so many DVDs now that it gets tiresome after a while[Its still good if you watch it every once in awhile.}

The extras in the second disk aren't as good as the ones on the  first. and where is the match with Cactus Jack vs. Triple H in hell in a cell? that match would have been perfect if it was placed at the end of the second disk to show how he retired. anyway this is still a great Dvd and well worth the money for it.",1090800000,2,2204,4.172169811320755
1975467,4,B00016XNRU,"First off, I am a huge Mick Foley mark, so take my opinion for what it is worth.  This DVD is a must-have for any Mick Foley fan.  It is a steal at its low price, and well worth the money.  Those of you who buy this DVD looking for great technical matches will probably be disappointed, for Foley was never really that type of wrestler.  However, if you are looking for some truly hardcore matches with plenty of spots that will make you rewind the DVD to view them again, this is the DVD for you.
  Perhaps the most compelling thing about this DVD is the abuse that Mick puts his body through.  On this DVD alone, Mick takes dozens and dozens of hard bumps onto solid concrete and then gets up and continues the match as though it was nothing.  Watching him wrestle, it is easy to underestimate how much alot of what he does really hurts.  A casual WWE fan probably won't be able to understand the hype behind Mick Foley, but those who understand the build-up of a great match will be amazed by the little things that Foley does to make both the match and his opponent look better.  Heck, Foley had alot to do with getting the Rock over as an effective heel during the late nineties, as well as HHH.  Foley, by putting his body through extreme pain, was able to make both of these superstars look far more vicious and heel-like than they ever had before.
  All the matches on this DVD are outstanding.  The only exception to this is the Cactus Jack vs. Sandman match, which I believe was included on this DVD to show you how Foley is able to carry a match with an opponent who is basically contributing nothing to the match.  The Sandman was knocked stupid very early on in this match, and could hardly stand.  He clearly had no idea what was going on for the rest of the match.  However, Foley was able to save the match by carefully directing the flow of the match, and makes the match halfway watchable, instead of the total disaster that it could have been.  The only reason I give this DVD four stars instead of five is that there are plenty of other Foley moments that could have been included.  Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk in Japan would have been great to include on this DVD, as many non-Japanese fans haven't seen this match before, and it is hands down the bloodiest match I have ever seen, period.  I'm not sure if WWE has the rights to that tape, however.  Regardless, Foley/HHH Hell in a Cell should definently have been included in this set, as well as Mankind vs. The Rock, I-Quit match, if for no other reason than the brutal chairshots that Foley takes while handcuffed.  I would also have liked to see more of Foley's promo's and interviews, as I think Foley is one of the greatest promo guys ever, possibly second only to Ric Flair.  The match with Vader where Foley lost his ear should also have been included on this set.  Finally, an interview with Foley about the transition from WWE Superstar to two-time best-selling author would have been nice.  Even still, the DVD is by far worth the money it costs, and is a must buy.  It isn't perfect, but it's darn close.",1086652800,5,3087,4.371929824561404
1975468,5,B00016XNRU,"I just bought this on Monday and here are my thoughts.
Disc 1:
Cactus Jack Vs. Big Van Vader - Not sure why this was put on here.  A very slow match with a lot of stalling from both men.  Their classic from Halloween Havoc would have been better than this. **
Cactus Jack And Maxx Payne Vs The Nasty Boys - Great brawl that is really fun to watch.  ****3/4
Cactus Jack Vs Sabu - Bleh.  Not much here.  **
Cactus Jack Vs Chris Candido- This is the first time I watched a match from SMW.  Really good match, one of the best on the set. ***3/4
Cactus Jack Vs The Sandman - The less said the better.  -*
Cactus Jack And Raven Va Terry Funk And Tommy Dreamer - Mixed feelings as I'm not much of a ECW fan.  However, again a lot of fun to watch with a lot of weapons used.  ***3/4
Cactus Jack Vs Mikey Whipwreck- Foley's last match in ECW.  A great match and great way to go.  ****
Disc 2
Mankind Vs Shawn Michaels - One of the best matches ever in the history of the WWE.  *****
Cactus Jack Vs HHH - From RAW 1997.  Really good brawl espically for RAW. The video shown at the beginning with all three of Foley's personalities talking to each other is awesome.  ***3/4
Dude Love Vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Over The Edge 1998) - Second best on the set.  Great mix of ring action with some spectacular brawling as well.  *****
Mankind Vs. The Undertaker - Foley almost killing himself does not make a great match.  Very sloppy match.  The chokeslam through the cage was an accident.  Match is * Historic Value is *****
Mankind Vs. The Rock - From RAW 1999 - This is Foley's first title win.  The match was pretty good but the moment is awesome. **3/4
Cactus Jack Vs. Triple H - Street Fight - There is not enough good to say about this match.  Both men worked there asses off and one of the best brawls EVER was the result.  *****
This is a mixed bag of good stuff and some average stuff, but the good far outweighs the bad.  This is a great DVD set.  My only suggestions would be to have included:
Hell In A Cell - No Way Out 2000 *****
Texas Death Match- Halloween Havoc 1993 ****1/2
If those were included this would be one of the best DVDS the WWE ever released.  However BUY THIS NOW!!!
I did not include any rating for the Terry Funk match because I didn't think it should have been on this.",1085529600,,2291,4.1173814898419865
1975469,5,B00016XNRU,"Now i will admit Mick Foley is not the best technically sound wrestler, but the heart and courage this man put in his matches were amazing. From his days as Cactus Jack, to the bizzare Mankind, and to the goofy Dude Love, Mick Foley gave it his all and as a fan of the wwe I would like to thank Mick Foley. BANG BANG!

1)vs. Big Van Vader
Ok but very slow. 6/10

Alright, not a big fan of wcw though. 4/10

6)vs. Mikey Whipwreck
Great, ECW was awesome,and Mikey Whipwreck did a great moonsault. 8/10
7) vs. Shawn Micheals
Good match that solidified HBK as whatever kind of wrestler he wanted to be. Mick was great and put a good effort into. 7/10
8)vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley (HHH)
good falls count anywhere match,not as good as the royal rumble, but still a great RAW match up. 9/10
9)vs. Terry Funk
Great hardcore match from two hardcore legends. Mick was sadistic in this one and Terry Funk proved that he could still go with the best of them. 8.5/10
10)vs. Stone Cold
Did like the match changing every time Stone Cold got the advantage. Stone Cold fought through all of it and came out on top. 7/10
11)Hell in a Cell vs. UnderTaker
Most of you already knows what happens in this match,but Mick shows alot of heart in this one. 10/10
12)vs. The Rock
Not their greatest match,rather would have wanted to see the Royal Rumble 99 match. But this one was also good . 8/10
13)street fight vs. HHH
Amazing!!!! A great effort by both men, and Mick was crazy in this one. This match showed what triple h was made of and why he is called ""the Game"". Mick took some extreme bumps and took everything HHH could give, but  a pedigree on some thumbtacks took Mick Foley out. 50/10",1085443200,,1955,4.3561643835616435
1975470,5,B00016XNRU,"This DVD highlighting Mick Foley's career from WCW to ECW to Smoky Mountain to WWE is a real thriller. All of the clips are uncut, and every single drop of blood is still intact. This includes his most famous matches (King of the Ring 1998, vs. Undertaker), his most famous promos/interviews (""Anti-Hardcore Promo, ECW), along with his more humorous bits (Mick and Al Snow lost in Las Vegas). If you are a WWE fan, an old-school WCW/ECW fan, or especially a Mick Foley fan, I strongly recommend you pick this double-disc set up. It's a real steal at it's Amazon price.",1084492800,,568,4.633663366336633
1975471,5,B00016XNRU,"I like the fact that this DVD contains matches from his ECW/WCW years as well as the WWE ones. On the 1st disc, the best marches are the match against Vader and his last ECW match. However, the best match on the entire set is definately ""Hell in a Cell"", with my second favorite being the matches against Triple H (not because Triple H is my favorite wrestler, but because of the way Dude Love, Cactus Jack, and Mankind are used on the same screen and because I love matches that end backstage). Mick Foley is not just a great wrestler, but a tremendous human being...Here is a quote from Barry J. Blaustein in ""Beyond the Mat"":
  ""Mick's behavior coulb be explained if he were crazy, but of all the wrestlers I met, Mick was the most normal, and the one I had the most in common with.""
What ultimately makes the set so great is actually Foley's humor. You can tell that this is a man who has not allowed his fame to go to his head. He still cares about his wife and kids. He still has a real prespective on life, and he has plans for his future, unlike many other former stars who have no direction (a la Jake Roberts).  Oh yeh; the extras are pretty good, too (I dudn't know that Mick had wrestled in the WWF in 1986!) and the Al Snow bit is really funny. Also buy his books; they're really awesome. I still can't get over how he was able to wrestle Hell in a Cell after that fall!",1084406400,2,1383,4.1722846441947565
1975472,2,B00016XNRU,"I was very excited when I first hear that this DVD was to be released and did much research to find out which matches would be included.  Sadly, I am not very pleased with the match selection of this set.  I guess my major problem is a good number of the matches are introduced by Foley with the comment, ""This is not the greatest match that _____ and I would have together, but. . ."" and he even refers to the match with Sandman as a ""Train Wreck"".  I mean, if this is supposed to be a compilation of the guy's greatest matches, shouldn't it have his GREATEST MATCHES?  Even Foley doesn't seem overly excited about the selection and implies more than once that the WWE chose most of these matches, not him.
Almost everything the guy did in the WWF up until 1998 was ignored besides his match with HBK that was released on a previous Foley DVD AND the HBK 2 did set.  Why not the Boiler Room Brawl or even his first win over the Undertaker at KOTR '96?  He supposedly had more success against the Undertaker than anyone else; why not show a bit of it?  They have the infamous Hell in a Cell match which is the most overplayed, over-released, and over-talked about match in WWF/E history.  Foley admits it's not his favorite match though it was important to his career.  Watch, it'll be released on the Undertaker DVD set too. . .
My biggest gripe about the DVD is that they decided to release the Street Fight with Triple H over the Hell in the Cell match, which ended Foley's career.  I think his retirement match should have definitely been on there instead of a match that has been released twice before on DVD.  Also, then blurring of the old WWF logo drives me nuts as well, but I guess that can't be helped.
Overall, this is an OKAY set that could have been much better by just tweaking a few of the matches.  More extras would have been cool too.  The man has had an awesome career and this release does reflect that, though if someone who has no idea what Mick Foley is all about saw this, they may walk away with the wrong idea.",1083456000,5,2037,4.287206266318538
1975473,4,B00016XNRU,"I just got this DVD, I was expecting something spectacular!!!!! Well it's pretty good, but not extraordinary.

1975475,5,B00016XNRU,"Mick Foley is a hardcore legend who has a lot of amazing matches. One of my favorite match's is Mankind and the undertaker at ""King of the Ring"" and Cactus Jack and Raven vs. Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer in ECW. The matches I disliked though, was the match between Mick Foley and Chris Candido. It just wasn't good. The ECW matches are awesome. The sandman match I didn't really like either, but I guess he just wanted people to see his frustration because the sandman was all knocked out and could hardly walk. It also has the famous and one of my favorite matches, with Shawn Michaels at MindGames. The only thing that I didn't like was if you could see the wwf sign they bluer it out. That gets really annoying. The only match I think is missing is between Mankind and Undertaker and Summer Slam'96,(The Boiler Room Match)that and the match where Mankind and The Rock fought in the empty arena, that was just great. They also should have put the ECW promo where Cactus Jack wears that funny shirt,WW F'n F. That shirt is really funny. Other than those draw backs this DVD is really good. What would have been greater though if they would have some of the Barbwire matches with Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk in Japan.

You see them connect unlike a lot of other wrestler's punches in the business. Sabu and Foley: If you see these two names in one match you know it will be crazy.
Foley in my opinion had his best matches in his career against Undertaker, Terry Funk, and Stone Cold. All of which you can see on this dvd. Every match has it's share of brutality in it. It's amazing that Foely is actually walking today. He gives you insight on each match before and after that match happens. So get this dvd NOW!!!!",1078358400,,617,4.237288135593221
1975478,5,B00016XNRU,"First things first:  If you're a big wrestling fan who buys a lot of wrestling DVDs, this might be a tough purchase to justify.  After all, the Shawn Michaels/Mankind match is on both the Mick Foley: Hard Knocks and Cheap Pops and the From The Vault Shawn Michaels DVD, as well as being on this.  The Street Fight from Royal Rumble 2000 is already avalible on the Triple H The Game DVD, and almost all of the ECW matches are on The Best of Cactus Jack in ECW Pioneer DVD.
So, if you already own all of that, it's a tougher to justify purchase.  If you don't have any of those, buy this.  Now.
Unlike the ECW DVD, there are actually some really good matches in this, not just his legendary promo work.  However, the Cane Dewey promo, which was oddly missing from the Pioneer disc, is on this.  It also has the highly influential Steve Austin match from Over the Edge 98, which might seem a little tame now, but was truly revolutionary at the time.  Ditto the Cactus Jack/Max Payne vs. The Nasty Boys Chigaco Street Fight from Spring Stampedee 94.
There is more than enough here to justify a purchase at the right price even if you do own all of the DVDs I mentioned earlier.  It's just not quite a slam dunk like it is if you don't have them.",1077840000,,1241,4.269230769230769
1975479,4,B00016XNRU,"Allow me to begin by saying that I am a hugh Mick Foley fan.  If you get the Royal Rumble 2004 DVD and you see the Mick Foley chair, I'm doing my ommage to the Corporate Mankind with my shorthsleeved white shirt and tie two rows back.  (Buy the Rumble 2004 DVD from Amazon as well.)  (Shameless plug, isn't it.)  But that doesn't have much to do with this DVD set.
I don't mind the matches they put on here.  Everyone can say that they remember a different match that could be used instead of a match on the DVD.  Personnally, I would like a little more coverage of the great fueds that Mick has had.  Instead of one match with the Undertaker or the Rock or HHH, maybe the WWE should have increased it to a 3 or 4 DVD set and shown the great fueds.  I would have liked to seen the buried alive match with the Undertaker as well as the Hell in the Cell.  I would have liked to seen the Halftime Heat as well as the Raw match with the Rock.  I would have liked to seen the Hell in the Cell as well as the Street Fight with HHH.  Maybe a little could have been done with the first Hard Core Champion Mankind.  (Those of us who were paying attention remember when Vince gave up Stone Cold's destroyed title belt to Mankind as the Hard Core Champion.)  If wishes and buts were candies and nuts...
None of this really matters to this DVD set.  It stands alone as a good compilation.  And most importantly to me, Mick explains a little about each match, and all the matches were shown completely.
All in all, you can't please everybody, but this DVD does it's best to try.  And it succeeds in accomplishing it's goal.  It chronicals the career of ""The"" Hardcore Legend.
Buy this set.",1077235200,,1676,4.2037617554858935
1975480,4,B00016XNRU,"This was a great DVD, however I have a few complaints. I thought a lot of the ECW matches were slow and often boring. I was never a really big ECW fan to begin with. I found (and still do) the matches sloppy and have very little pacing. When I did watch, it was for the non-stop, spot heavy action that I did see. (Mainly featuring RVD)  I do remember seeing a Sandman vs. Cactus Jack match that was insane (from 1994 ??), but they chose not to show that one.
I thought the Smoky Mountain Wrestling match with Chris Candido was boring.  My feeling is I guess I am not a true fan as I thought. Most of the older matches I found very boring and while they may have been ground breaking 7, 8 and 9 years ago, to me they didn't hold up.
What I did like was many of the promos that were on the disc. I thought the Anti-Hardcore promo was one of the best. Mic Foley has always been a genius behind the mic for interviews, those were great.
I liked the WCW footage, the Nasty Boys match was really brutal. The Vader match was ok, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype Mic put on it.
Since I have always enjoyed the WWF, it's only natural that I thought the WWF footage was the best.  I haven't seen the Mankind vignettes literally since his debut. Some I didn't even remember ever seeing. I thought there could have been other matches selected for this DVD. Seeing the HBK Mind-Games match on yet another DVD is shocking. The space could have been used for many other matches. One being the great match vs. The Rock at the Royal Rumble 1999, Also something about Mic's role in Survivor Series 1998 would have been cool. There is also a segment that aired on Sunday Night Heat ages ago that featured Triple H and Mic Foley talking about their match at SummerSlam 1997. That could have been included. Plus I am a big fan of putting forgotten RAW and Smackdown matches on these things. It really does fans no justice to put matches on DVD that are already on other DVD's or are PPV matches, as many fans already have these. It's RAW matches that I think more people would enjoy. I loved the fact that the Triple H vs. Cactus Jack (complete with that awesome promo) was on the DVD.  However, there were great segments like Mic coasting down the ramp on a gurney the day after his match at Royal Rumble 1999 match, along with so many more Foley moments that were left out.  I just felt a little slighted.
Don't get me wrong this is a great collection and really catalogs a great career. But many of the matches at least to me seem dated slow and often boring. At least until you get to the WWF stuff. I also enjoyed the fact that Foley himself hosted the disc. It's a good disc I just wish it was more involved like the Ric Flair disc, I guess with that being the current benchmark for retro superstars DVD releases, it's going to be very hard to please the hard-core fans. Still a good buy.",1076630400,2,2884,4.226860254083484
1975481,3,B00016XNRU,"I am one of Mick Foley's biggest fans, but WWE ruined some classic matches with the poor digital covering of the old WWF symbol.

1975482,5,B00016XNRU,"This is the best Mick Foley DVD ever!!! It features many of the most memorable matches of his 15 year career. There's plenty of blood & guts for gore hounds. That's right, this 2-disc set DVD is loaded with violence and bloody action. You'll see Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack) slicing up Terry Funk's injured arm with a sharp blade. You'll see Mick Foley (as Mankind) being planted on thousands of sharp thumbtacks. The match in which Sabu does a moonsault and severly cracks his ribs on a steel guard rail will even make you hurt! With that being said, I must honestly say that this DVD is NOT for the faint of heart! The blood really does flow freely in some of these matches. You'll also see some of Mick's most memorable promos, interviews, and skits. All of the matches and promos are presented in their entirety. The brutal violence is uncensored, but a lot of the profanity is bleeped. Plus, in all of the WWE matches, the old WWF logo is blurred, which may be a small problem for some viewers. However, this DVD is incredible. I'm glad I own it. I strongly recommend this DVD for any true wrestling fan. It's worth your money.",1075766400,,1131,4.468599033816425
1975483,4,B00016XNRU,"I've always been a huge Foley fan, going all the way since I'd first seen him in the Dallas Sportatorium, taking a sick fall from the ring to the floor.  So the news of this boxed set was a big deal to me.  I've been an independent pro wrestler in Texas for nearly 6 years now, and Mick is easily the biggest influence on my style and character, as I emulate some facets of my idol in my work.
This set has some great, great moments.  Disc 1, however, seems a little off to me.  Only one Cactus Jack VS Vader match is shown, and it's not the best they had.  I would have much rather seen the ""Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal"" match they had later, as well as at least a mention of the brutal powerbomb on the floor that added so much to this war.  The Cactus VS Sandman match is out of place as well.  The bonus features on Disc 1 has Cactus VS Sting and Cactus VS Sabu II, both great matches that are much more deserving of main menu than the two I mentioned.
Disc 2, the WWF years, is fantastic, though I don't know why the I Quit match between Mankind and the Rock isn't there. Nor was the Boiler Room Brawl between him and The Undertaker.  The WWF ""attitude"" logo is blurred out due to legal reasons, but WWE can't be blamed for that.  Even still, it can be somewhat distracting.  Some of the hilarious Rock and Sock Connection stuff should have been included as well.
Navigation of the discs is very easy...much easier than the Flair set's was.  All of the audio and video is top notch quality, even though there is some editing of matches (anything voiced by Jesse Ventura is edited out, and the WWF Cactus Jack music is dubbed in his WCW and ECW entrances).
Great value for the price of a true legends work...a man that truly busted his butt to give the fans their moneys worth.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me is for the lack of important career moments and matches that, for some reason, were excluded.
Exclusions aside, though, this is a must buy for anyone who wants to see the work of someone who truly gave of himself for the wrestling business.

1975484,4,B00016XNRU,"Since I'd only started watching wrestling during the late Attitude era, I didn't really know much about Mick Foley's career before he donned the leather mask and sock puppet.  When his first book (""Have a Nice Day!"") came out, I picked it up like a good Mankind fan, and discovered how inspirational and strangely gentle this in-ring psycho was.  From getting his arm nearly blown off in Japan to going to theme parks with his kids, Foley turned out to be one hell of a role model.
Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses is a good tribute to his legend.  Although Foley himself admits that some of the matches included on the DVD aren't the best (see his bout with Sandman, or his first televised match with the British Bulldogs), they all show the Hardcore Legend doing what he does best: getting the living crap kicked out of him in as entertaining a way as possible.  In fact, throughout the entire DVD, Foley only wins a handful of the matches shown.
But truthfully, for me, the main selling point of the DVD was the collection of Foley promos.  Having never heard the ""Cane Dewey"" promo or Mick's first Mankind vignettes before this DVD, I couldn't help but be impressed.  In all honesty, they could have devoted the entire DVD to a collection of Mick Foley promos, and I would have been perfectly happy.  ""Cane Dewey,"" for those (like me) that haven't seen it before...wow.  Unfortunately, Mankind's interview with Jim Ross is severely cut down (only the last part is included on the DVD), and none of Mick's later mic sessions (besides a brief skit with Kurt Angle) are shown.  I really wouldn't have complained about losing the Vader match in return for the Cactus Jack/Triple H buildup to the Royal Rumble street fight.
As far as the matches go, simple brutality is the name of the game.  The Hell in the Cell with Undertaker is included, as is the Street Fight with Captain Trips.  Also shown is a great tag ECW tag match between Cactus Jack/Raven and Terry Funk/Tommy Dreamer, Mankind vs. Shawn Michaels, a great Foley/Candido match, and a suprisingly good bout between Mick and Maxx Payne and the Nasty Boys (table suplex!).  Unfortunately, on the flip side we have the almost depressingly boring Vader/Cactus Jack brawl (partially due to the simply pitiful commentary), which is, at least, the first match on the DVD.  Also, I was somewhat disappointed that none of Foley's Japanese Deathmatches were included, or (a nitpick probably shared by no one) the Dude Love/Owen Hart brawl in which the two men savagely beat eachother with bags of popcorn.  Not exactly Ric Flair/Steamboat, but classic nonetheless.
All in all, while the quality of the included matches isn't up to the standards set by Ric Flair's DVD, and more promos and interviews would have been appreciated, Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses is still an excellent collection and a tribute to a great human being.  For the Foley Fan who already has Mick's two autobiographies and a copy of Tietam Brown, this is for you.  For the Scott Keiths out there hoping for a package of ***** matches, well, look elsewhere.
