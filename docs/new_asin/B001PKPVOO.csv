3747648,2,B001PKPVOO,"I usually love the DVDs from Shape, but I was really disappointed with this one.  The workouts - both the cardio segments and toning segments - are fairly effective for an intermediate exerciser (although not great), but I found it very difficult to stay motivated to get all the way through the segments because of the instructor.  She doesn't cue well or work both sides of the body evenly, and unfortunately her words of encouragement got on my nerves rather than got me to work harder.  She also says those words of encouragement at weird times when I don't really need it and when she could be talking about something more helpful like form and technique.  This is the first time I've ever found a Shape product to be less than satisfactory, but I thought that this DVD was not up to the standards of the others, and the annoying instruction overrode any of the benefits of the workouts themselves.",1257984000,5,903,4.625
3747649,2,B001PKPVOO,"The actual workouts were challenging with lots of interesting variations on classic moves. I am sure they would be effective over time, if I could only get past the masculine and annoying instructor. The instructor is Dominique Hall - if you were expecting the trifecta of excellence (Lisa Wheeler, Tracy York and Michelle Dozois) you will be very disappointed. Hall's background is in bodybuilding. Her voice is so masculine and her body is ""jacked"" - I am not talking Justice in the Hip Hop Abs series jacked, more like the abs of a male model in Men's Health. She tries to motivate you, but does so by only saying ""that's it"" repeatedly. For the entire time I am doing the DVD all I can think is, ""for the love of god, I hope I do not look like her when I am done."" The workouts are not as effective, and pale in comparison to the Shape Bikini Body Boot Camp Transforming and Redefining DVDs. If you want a Shape workout, go with one of those because they are amazing.",1250208000,7,971,4.430167597765363
3747650,3,B001PKPVOO,"I have been exersizing regularly for over 15 years and for the last 5-6 I am ""on"" DVDs and videos. I own quite a lot of those: favorites, not fun but very effectives, bad ones that I simply avoid... This particular instructor tries too hard to motivate, to a point that it derives my nerves. I actually decided to count how many time she says ""that's it!!"" with a really annoying tone. I am afraid that this one belongs to my ""bad ones that I avoid"". It's sad since it could have been considered somewhat effective if the instructor was more ""real"".",1249257600,,549,4.392156862745098
3747651,4,B001PKPVOO,"This workout was really fun and really got my heart pumping.  I enjoy how there are 3 levels of training in the video, which enables me to tailor it completely to what I can do.",1246924800,,177,4.057142857142857
3747652,5,B001PKPVOO,"BUY this DVD ~ You won't be disappointed.  You'll get a great total body workout and achieve great results !  Dominique Hall is an EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR giving instructions with a clear, pleasant voice and she has a very good personality.  All of her exercises are clearly explained and she goes at a good pace throughout the workouts.  I hope that Dominique will be starring in a variety of different DVD workouts in the future.",1245110400,,428,4.743243243243243
3747653,5,B001PKPVOO,"I have never written a review for any workout DVD, but strongly felt that this one is worth taking the time and writing about.  I am a lawyer and a wife and barely have time to do anything, let alone workout.  I have tried over a dozen of workout DVD's that swear that in a short amount of time, you will get an amazing workout.  None of them have backed up the talk that they so promised.  This DVD has allowed me to find 30 minutes out of my schedule to get in a workout that ACTUALLY DELIVERS ON ITS PROMISES! After I'm done with the 30 minute workout, I feel so great, that I actually do the additional 10 minute abs section.  This DVD allows you to do a workout that is quick and VERY effective.  After doing the workout, I have not felt so sore in a very long time.  All the additions and mini workouts that come after the main program are great as well.  When I'm really strapped for time, I take one or two of the 10 minute workouts and feel amazing.  If you are a busy person, but is really looking for a workout that will not bore you to death or will make you dread doing it, then I highly recommend this DVD.  You will not be disappointed!",1241136000,35,1151,4.075555555555556
3747654,4,B001PKPVOO,"The Ultimate Bikini Body Workout DVD has 3 sections:

+ 30 minute total body workout (ended up being about 38 minutes)
+ 10-minute conditioning & strengthening segments (abs/core and butt/legs)
+ 10-minute cario blast

Dominique Hall is the lead in these workouts. The 30 minute workout alternates intense sculpting moves with cardio conditioning.  She does a great job keeping the heart rate up and the muscles burning! There's a pushup move she does while holding a weight...quite impressive.  I enjoyed some new twists on standard exercises.  There are a good bit of squat moves and lounges....I don't recommend this if you have bad knees.

There were a few times her attempts at motivating to ""hang in there"" just weren't necessary, instead, I think a countdown or mentioning # of reps left would be more effective. Other than that, I think this is a good, solid workout.

The 10 minute cardio blast I loved...Dominique had a great variation of moves.  This will get your heart pumping!  I enjoyed her instruction in this =)

I gave this DVD four stars because it didn't meet the intensity level of the previous Shape Bikini Body workout. The previous Shape BBW also hit more muscle groups than this Ultimate BBW.

3747696,5,B001PKPVOO,Great complete workout!  I highly recommend it.,1406246400,,47,5.714285714285714
3747697,4,B001PKPVOO,I love this dvd! It came in great condition. I also paid a good price. Very good cardio and ab workouts.,1396310400,,104,4.0
3747698,5,B001PKPVOO,"I highly recommend this workout DVD. It is effective in combining cardio and strength training at the same time. Just what your  body needs in order to get the results you want. I found the instructor to be very motivating and She doesn't go through the exercises to quickly. There's two other ladies you can follow, beginner and advanced. At the end of the routine she does a five minute cool down which is great. This exercise DVD got my heart rate up and my whole body sweatin'! :) Do this three times a week and you will see results.",1363132800,,537,4.37
3747699,5,B001PKPVOO,This was a video that was easy for an uncoordinated person to follow.  I started seeing areas start to firm up in a couple of weeks.  I tried numerous other videos but found myself lost in all the dance steps or too slow to catch up.  This goes at a nice slow pace but still gives you a great workout.,1331942400,,301,3.9833333333333334
3747700,4,B001PKPVOO,I just finished my workout and I give it two thumbs up! The instructor was not as bad as the reviews and she really worked your butt! I recommend it to add to your workout DVDS when you need something a little bit different.,1327017600,,224,4.113636363636363
3747701,4,B001PKPVOO,"I felt sore and exhausted after I did this. It's not as intense as Jillian Michaels. Instructor Dominique Hall is not annoying and a great motivator. Her 6 pack abs are exactly how I'd like mine to be! This workout is perfect for beginners. Even though I'm not a beginner, I saw results after using this just a few days. The instructor gets right to the point and not a lot of chit-chat, except to explain the workout.",1316476800,3,418,4.371794871794871
3747702,5,B001PKPVOO,I have tried MANY workout dvd's and this was the only one that had me breaking a sweat within minutes of pressing start. Customizable- you can either do a few short workouts or a few longer ones with different area's of concern. My dvd also came with a year subscription to Shape which was awesome when I was looking for new workout tips.,1313539200,,338,4.380952380952381
3747703,1,B001PKPVOO,Good workout but the instructor should have done some acting classes before she shot this dvd her cueing is quite hilarious. It's hard to do this video more than once or twice max. But it is a good workout so if you can afford it then why not!,1311984000,,243,4.083333333333333
3747704,5,B001PKPVOO,"I am not generally a big fan of exercise DVDs, but this is an exception for me.  I'm in pretty good shape and this DVD gives me a very satisfying workout in a short amount of time.  One thing to note: The DVD claims the workout is 30 minutes, but it's actually 38.  I really like the instructor, Dominique Hall.  She is upbeat, but not annoyingly chipper.  Highly recommended!",1289347200,2,376,4.391304347826087
3747715,5,B001PKPVOO,"I really enjoy this work out and I feel great after I'm done.  It's quick, to the point, and really works your body.  I bought it because it's a mix between strength and cardio.  It's also a short work out which I like doing during the week before work.

I also like how it has 10 minute:

Lower body
Abs
Cardio

I try to do the cardio before the actual main work out to get my heart beat up so I don't always finish the main work out.

I've been working out consistently for about 6 months, so I am not a beginner but definitely not far from it and I think this is a good work out if you have limited history.  If you have been working out for a while, it may be good for a slow day.",1283385600,2,684,3.835714285714286
3747716,4,B001PKPVOO,"When I was in excellent shape, this workout did nothing for me.  But now that I've taken 6 months off from working out, its great.  After doing twice a week for 2 weeks I lost 2 inches off my hips and I could handle the push-ups much better.  This is pretty good for a total body workout, the best I've seen for a 30 minute DVD.",1282953600,2,328,3.9393939393939394
3747717,2,B001PKPVOO,"It just never worked out for me. The instructor wasn't so energetic and the quick workout nearly hurt my knee.

Ill just say I prefer other dvds. I gave this Dvd to my mum, she likes it so to each's own.",1278201600,,203,3.951219512195122
3747718,2,B001PKPVOO,"and that is a really BIG but...I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of the workout!! The instructor was not motivating at ALL; in fact she's incredibly monotone and I swear if I hear the words, ""Thaaaaaat's it!"" one more time I may scream!!  After 10 minutes I wanted to put my fist through the TV...even my boyfriend noticed how often she said those words.  There were times when she didn't speak at all and didn't educate about the importance of form once!  I've tried many workout dvds and I can usually get through them even if the instructor is mediocre but this one just got on my last nerve!",1277251200,2,600,4.4363636363636365
3747719,5,B001PKPVOO,"I have really enjoyed working out with this instructor.  The exercises are challenging for an intermediate beginner, and I've seen the effects of my workouts on my size 2, 125lbs, 5'2.5'' frame.  I exercise on and off, and this has been a great motivator for me.  The instructor is great. The exercises are great for toning abs and butt, slimming the waist, and shaping the back and legs.  I really like it, and so does my body.",1273622400,,428,4.51948051948052
3747720,2,B001PKPVOO,"I love SHAPE's fitness DVDs & have owned their Bikini Body Boot Camp series for years & still love them! I bought this hoping for an update to add to my routine & was quite diappointed when I received this one.

The workout is just okay - it felt really long due to lack of upbeat music, dark setting, & boring moves. The instructor really ruined it for me - not your lovable power team from before (Tracy York, Michelle Dozois, & Lisa Wheeler). The instructor is a pretty cold, militant woman with a body that looks like she should be training in the army, rather than a SHAPE bikini workout. I found her unmotivating & just wanted to turn it off so I didn't have to listen to her anymore. I tried to warm up to this DVD by giving it a few trys, but I really don't like it at all.

I would recommend avoiding this one & sticking to the classic Bikini Body Boot Camp series which is truly the best value for your money!",1273363200,3,919,4.157303370786517
3747721,4,B001PKPVOO,"This is a great workout for women on the go or with packed schedules. Although there isn't a solid block of cardio time as is common with Tai-Bo style workouts, the cardio-strength intervals on this DVD had my heart rate going and muscles burning within the first 15 minutes. I felt stronger even after my first workout and I now look forward to mastering the harder moves (maintaining a single handed plank position while pumping a 5 Ib weight). The instructor is okay, not one of my faves, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers may claim. Lower the volume, put on your favorite tunes, count your reps (about 6 per set) and it's no big deal. And ladies, don't hate on a women who's put time and effort into her ""jacked"" look. Every woman has her own health and image ideal.",1271808000,2,782,4.4
3747722,5,B001PKPVOO,"All I can say is WOW!! I love this workout. I feel it EVERYWHERE! That is definately not somthing I can say with most videos. The instructor is wonderful, encouraging and not overly ""peppy"". I never got lost with the moves and it was not very ""dancy"". I would buy any and every workout dvd featuring Dominique Hall. Can't go wrong with this one!!",1271808000,,346,4.421875
3747723,5,B001PKPVOO,I just bought the DVD and have been trying it out. The ab workout is fabulous and I felt the burn right away. Some of the workout positions aren't my fav but overall I like it and I see already a change in my abs after almost 3 weeks of working out. And I don't do it daily but pretty much every other day and sometimes twice in one day to make up for a day lost. With every workout you also have to watch what you eat too so it's not like you just use the DVD and then eat 3000 + a day. Gotta sweat a bit to get results but this DVD sure helps!,1267315200,,545,3.6666666666666665

8333500,4,B001PKPVOO,Love it!  This dvd has a lot of options!  It is fantastic for beginners and if you are advanced you can do the whole dvd and get a good workout.  I like the variety of exercises Dominique put together. She is encouraging and focuses on form.  Go slow she says well going slow hurts!!  She was in no rush and it made you really feel the pain!  That is why beginners can do this workout with no problems.  There is a 30 minute total body workout and several 10 minute workouts you can add on or do alone.  You will see results with this one,1522627200,,538,4.057142857142857
8333501,5,B001PKPVOO,Good video,1503792000,,10,4.5
8333502,5,B001PKPVOO,"Okay, so I'm addicted to working out at home (just joking).  I work out daily, and own over 250 dvds.  This has got to be one of the all time best workouts ever!  I only wish that Dominique Hall, the trainer, had done more dvds.  What makes this dvd great?  The trainer has a delightful personality - warm, friendly and motivating.  Her instructions are excellent.  And, I love, love, love that she works multiple muscle groups together, so your time is not wasted.  There are modifications for every move, so you can start using this dvd as a beginner, and it will still be a great workout when you become advanced.  Plus, the exercises are not at all boring, nor repeated ad nauseum.  Really and truly, it's an absolutely perfect exercise routine.  The fact that you can buy it used on Amazon at a low price, just adds to the reasons you need to have this dvd in your collection.  Love, love, love it !!!!",1500336000,,907,4.430303030303031
8333503,5,B001PKPVOO,"It is a quick and very effective workout.  Hiit with just enough cardio burns and the toning exercises target everything.  My butt finally has that firm  little lift I always worked so hard for yet never seemed to achieve.  I think these are those fast and effective exercises celebrities and models use to be photo ready. A modified beginner level for beginners or for tired days when you aren't feeling it, so there is no excuse not to workout.  There are also 10 minute routines and cardio blast for days you are short on time.  My only pet peeve is the instructor says"" That's it!"" a few too many times, but she is trying to encourage you.  It really comes close to being the perfect workout DVD.  You will be bathing suit ready in no time if you stick with this one at least 3times a week. I will be using this one a lot because it is FUN, fast & effective.",1498089600,2,862,4.277777777777778
