4286617,3,B0048LVDH6,"Kansas used to be what some call a blue state but as we see in the documentary WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS?, inspired by the non-fiction book of the same name, it is today a so-called red state.  Compelling in an understated way, the film feels like what might happen were you to travel through the Sunflower State and randomly meet several of its residents.  What they all have in common is being in over their heads, with opportunity in Kansas and virtually everywhere else in America the worst since the Great Depression.  As WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS? depicts, too many Kansans rally behind the political forces that have destroyed the prosperity their parents and grandparents knew.",1354838400,,693,4.8559322033898304
4286618,4,B0048LVDH6,"Kansas has long served as a powerful metaphor for our country.  When L. Frank Baum first wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900, he chose Kansas as his setting for idyll, peace, comfort and safety, a home that there was ""no place like."" Even earlier, Dodge City became a metaphor for the Wild West, a place of independence and ruthlessness, where a man's mettle would surely be tested and everyone walked around with a careless swagger. As Kansas reached statehood and matured into the Union, it was long a hot-bed of radical, populist and socialist ideas. Kansas, considered a center of early 20th century Progressivism, was also a metaphor for the hard-working individual with a social conscience.

Today Kansas still offers itself up as metaphor, but now the echoes are of an ultra-conservative, religion-centric inflexibility built from such images as the Westboro Baptist Church and the Dover school district, the former infamous for its aggressive anti-gay tactics and the latter for its ignominious attempt to force religion into the school district's science curriculum.

Kansas has changed, and so have we all.

What's the Matter with Kansas?, a documentary by Laura Cohen and Joe Winston (based on the 2004 book by Thomas Frank) washes the screen with those metaphors in beautiful hues, stark contrasts and--often--with probing insight and irony.  Following the paths of several key figures across political, personal and religious landscapes, the filmmakers draw a surrealistic portrait of a changed Kansas, one where social issues determine political affiliations, sometimes in direct contrast with an individual's own interests.

The movie doesn't preach: there is no narration, no specific storyline, no ""Michael Moore"" moment designed to get us all whipped up.  There is balance and delicacy and respect, yet still you may be left with the feeling that something remains missing.  Watching the movie at home on a quiet Friday evening (and having recently read the book as well), what struck me was the feeling that the movie's main character--the key protagonist--was always off screen. That protagonist--the political engine that depends on marketing and money and messaging to create its preferred political culture, one designed to keep the elected, elected--may be the film's single most powerful character.

For me, awareness of that off-screen protagonist doubled the movie's impact. I recommend the documentary--which Roger Ebert named one of his ten best last year--for all who want a quiet yet striking insight into the workings of our political landscape.",1326758400,5,2582,5.3399014778325125
4286619,3,B0048LVDH6,"I READ TOM FRANK'S  BOOK WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND LOOKED FORWARD EAGERLY TO SEEING THIS DOCUMENTARY.

IT WAS VISUALLY COMPELLING AND THE KANSANS FEATURED WERE ATTRACTIVE AND IN SOME CASES, COLORFUL.  BUT THE MANNER OF PRESENTING THE POPULIST THINKING SO PREVELANT IN THE STATE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, WITH NO NARRATIVE,  LEFT ME UNSATISFIED.  AFTER VIEWING ALL THE OTHER CHOICES ON THE MENU, I UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS DONE THAT WAY, BUT SOME OVERARCHING CRITICISMS AND FRANKLY, POLITICAL WARNINGS, ABOUT WHAT THIS GROWING MOVEMENT MEANS FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN IN AMERICA, WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.",1314316800,2,600,5.02020202020202
4286620,5,B0048LVDH6,"Joe Winston and Laura Cohen take an honest look at the American heartland and let the people and their actions speak for themselves. Finely crafted with an acute awareness for preserving the honesty behind each of the characters, this film reminds us of the documentary genre's responsibility to present reality and leaves the ultimate analysis, judgment and conclusions to be made by the viewer. With a respectful voice, an insightful eye and a political historian's acumen, ""What's the Matter With Kansas"" gives us a look at a part of America that believes in the greater good, but  whose efforts in trying to accomplish it, are ultimately undermining themselves. It is a part of our country that many of us know little about first hand and may even forget that it exists.  For all of these reasons and many more,  for both its form and its content ""What's the Matter with Kansas?"" is an important and worthy insight into American politics and history today.",1298505600,3,960,4.877300613496932
4286621,3,B0048LVDH6,"Based on Thomas Franks' book of the same title, the film explores the dichotomy of Kansas' radical roots and its modern day conservatism rooted in faith.

Two questions persist throughout the story: how did such a radical, 19th century community that gave birth to populism morph into a bastion of Christian conservatism while the second quesstion asks why conservative Kansans vote against their best economic hope for survival?

It becomes clear early on that Republican/conservatives are ""vote driven"" based on social issues rather than economic ones in a state that has limited economic opportunities. Bush and liberals are seen in a Manichean context: he is the good because he is a Christian and all else, abortion, gay marriage, etc. are evil and forecast the destruction of the country. This carries over in the belief that the Founding Fathers created a Christian nation and that creationism describes the universe instead of the big bang theory. Their faith is imbued through home-schooling, politically-influenced sermons, and a trip to a creation museum where evolution is considered as a result of the murders at Columbine. (Coincidentally, the museum shown is not in Kansas). Shot during the 2006 election, the conservatives are unable to fathom through their insular paradigm the results of the election. It's almost as if their faith and prayer expected better election results and economic miracles. (The theme park portion of the film is particularly telling).

The liberal side is given equal depth. One cigar-chomping farmer finds Bush's administration arrogant. He speaks with a slow drawl that masks a keen intellect. His farm is in decline and all he is looking for is a fair economic playing field. It might be said that this is the American the administration counted on but forgot to reward. He does not believe in free market capitalism.  An old curmudgeon expresses his liberal defiance in iron art he displays by the roadside. His signs are graphic as are the words and symbols he adds. His attitude is blunt. ""Gay marriage is none of my business.""

Nowhere does conservatism and liberalism clash more than over abortion, and Kansas, in the film and reality, is the epicenter of that conflict. Dr Tiller is featured and villified by the religious right. With the exception of abortion, both sides are seen side-by-side rather than in conflict.

Two things disappointed me about the film. Background music without narration created a attention-deficit effect, making my mind wander especially if the dialogue became mundane. Most importantly, the film doesn't come close to answering its own question, what's the matter with Kansas? What does manage to come through is a sense of tragedy, a firm belief in the American dream that is unrealized.

The book is much more informative even though it too fails to answer the question. My recommendation would be to buy the book and rent the film.",1298073600,4,2918,5.117647058823529

He gets amazing access to their opinions and private life stories over a few years. This community's story is universal and everyone should see it.  Some pretty wild characters, I laughed a lot.

Some reviews I read seemed like the reviewer was disappointed and taken off guard by the fact that this film is non judgmental and they couldn't feel superior like they wanted to. I went to a talk back with the filmmakers and the promise to those real Americans that allowed them such close access was that he would only use their words.  There would be no sardonic Michael Moore style voiceover coloring the story, only the words and actions of the people themselves. And there are some real characters and a lot of funny moments!
But the brilliant editing of the footage tells a troubling story.  I may never be best friends with any of these people, but I was blown away by how my opinion of some of these folks changed by the end of the film.  I found it fascinating, funny and eye opening.  I would recommend it to Democrat and Republican viewers alike.",1296518400,10,982,4.49438202247191
4286625,5,B0048LVDH6,"I just finished watching this film, and am now watching the bonus Q&A.

One questioner mentions something that reviews at other sites also brought up. It seems that many people feel that the title question is not answered by the film.

I do not agree.

I quote from a blurb at another site: ""Documentarian Joe Winston takes the premise of Thomas Frank's 2004 book of the same name -- namely that the GOP got working- and middle- class Midwesterners to vote Republican when it wasn't in their fiscal self-interest -- ...""

A number of segments make it clear that the fiscal interests of Kansas are not being served by the Democrats, either. Specifically, I refer to the segments with the Farm Union President, anything mentioning Populist platform and reform, and the 'tornadoes blow, FEMA sucks,"" segment.

Since neither party is looking to the *fiscal * interests of the average person/working man, the party that is selected is the one that is looking to ANY of their interests: the Republican support of religio-moral issues.

Pretty simple.

This film illustrates it beautifully, and quite subtly.

Most of the people interviewed were Western Kansas super-conservatives. There were two characters who represented the other side: one didn't really care about politics, and the other was a candidate who was treated like a pariah by everyone in his conservative community. I've lived in Kansas most of my life, and this did not represent the people I know. I have no doubt that there are people out on the plains who are afraid of too much information, and too many outsiders telling them how to live. Many have lived in the same communities for generations, and some don't trust strangers. Most are good people who follow a very specific set or moral principals, and violation of those moral principals is not an option in their view. I felt this film tried to portray these people as very ignorant and vengeful and backward. No focus was given to any other group of Kansans, so the overall impression one is left with is that all Kansans are backward, gun-toting, religious hypocrites.",1394755200,,1135,4.795918367346939
8418753,3,B0048LVDH6,"What's the Matter with Kansas? (Joe Winston, 2009)

If you follow my reviews at all, you are probably well aware that I'm a fan of horror movies. Big-budget, no-budget, ghosts, gore, even vampire and werewolf love triangles, I'll watch them all. So attach as much gravity to this statement as you feel it is worth: the scariest creature I have ever seen on a movie screen is Brittany Barden, the almost-college-aged daughter of one of the families at the heart of Joe Winston's terrifying, infuriating documentary What's the Matter with Kansas?. Brittany is a model child of the neocon movement. She parrots all the lies with complete conviction. Her greatest dream is to attend Patrick Henry College and become a PAE (politically active evangelical). In short, she is everything that is wrong with heartland America wrapped up in one convenient package. I watched Uwe Boll's Rampage earlier on the day I watched What's the Matter with Kansas?, and while I was enduring this pain, I found myself growing more and more sympathetic to the actions of Brenadan Fletcher's character in that movie; more than once I thought filling the back of a van with C4, driving it into the center of Kansas, and setting it off remotely would be a fantastic idea.

Ostensibly, the film follows Terry Fox, who as the story opens is the pastor of Immauel Baptist Church in Wichita. Fox is of a new breed of preacher, the ones who consider themselvespresumably by dint of their theology degreesto be qualified to not only hold forth on political topics, but to pressure the masses in the pews to vote a particular way. It won't be much of a surprise, if you live in this country, to note that said particular way involves whatever candidate is anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage, anti-any form of progress that has brought America's culture out of the middle ages in the past fifty or so years. (They have not yet openly cottoned to being anti-integration, but given their other stances, it's only a matter of time before that occurs.) Usually, that means voting Republican, and in the years since this movie was made, these people have taken over and remodeled what was originally known as the Tea Party in their own image. (The original Tea Party in the mid-2000s were entirely financial-reform oriented, with no religious bent, judging by the books I've read from the first years of the movement.) Fox, of course, is backing Republican candidate Phil Kline for governor, who marches in lockstep with the crazy-Christian contingent. (We first meet Brittany Barden as a volunteer in Kline's campaign headquarters.) At the beginning of the movie, Winston paints a picture of Kansas that is bleak in the extreme; it seems as if Immanuel Baptist is some sort of Blob-like amoebic structure that can do nothing but grow in power, swallow all around it, and eventually take over the universe. But all is not well in the church, and Fox finds himself ousted for using the pulpit to preach political messages; the latter half of the film follows Fox and his dwindling flock as the chapels in which they meet get smaller and smaller, while Phil Kline's lead in the polls dwindles by the day. (Which is not to say that they are not still dangerous, nor that their message of hate and intolerance is not still poisonous; the film's final twist of the knife, after the end credits, notes that George Tiller, a Wichita doctor who was interviewed for the film and was one of the last American doctors willing to perform late-term abortions, the procedure the crazy-Christian contingent term partial-birth abortions, was shot and killed by one of the crazy Christians, Army of God member Scott Roeder, just before the movie's release.)

I try, as often as I can, to keep my personal views out of my feelings on a given movie (this is harder to do with documentaries oftentimes, viz. Bullya review I have not yet finished writing because of that) when rating it. That is very difficult when it comes to What's the Matter with Kansas? because most of the people onscreen are so thoroughly hateful. But I'll try. When I was watching the movie, I didn't realize that Fox was the central character of the film thanks to the way the opening sequences are set up, so it seemed to me that the second half of the movie had wandered off track for a while. (I should probably also mention this is one of those movie for which I have considered instituting a Netflix Synopsis Accuracy guide, since this is another case where, on a scale of 1 to 10, the Netflix synopsis accuracy hovers around 2, and this did not help.) After I read a few synopses of the movie (including the official one), I realized the problem was with my perception rather than the direction of the movie, and I'd planned to bump it up a bitbut I'm feeling grinchy today, and really, if I got that far off-track because of the way the first sequences of the movie are set up, is that my fault or is it the movie's? I would posit, especially since I'm one of those guys who's always telling you movie [x] makes perfect sense as long as you pay a modicum of attention, that in this case it's the movie's more than it is mine, and I took back that half-star. This is not to say that the car accident onscreen is any easier to tear your eyes away from, or that you won't leave the experience one iota less wanting to put 90% of the people you've just spent the last hour and a half with out of our misery. But whether it is or not, the last half of the film feels somewhat directionless, which is kind of a downer. Not a good thing when your entire film is conceived to be (and so successfully is) a downer. However, despite the average rating I'm giving it, this does ot in any way mean you should not watch the film; do so at your earliest opportunity.

I should also note that, when I watched this, the average rating for the movie on Netflix was two stars. There's something to be said for the monkeys not liking to be told they're monkeys. ** ",1386460800,,5967,4.625471698113207
8418754,3,B0048LVDH6,"I gave this only 3 stars because of the editing with yielded a much too slow tempo in several parts and for the look of the film.

Other than that, the info in the film was eye-opening.  At first, I thought it was going to be a rant by Christians of the unlearned denomination that run with a politician just because he may have so much as said ""God bless you"" when someone sneezed, but that wasn't the main goal of the film.  It simply shows you how beliefs in Kansas have grown over time and how it shaped political views nationwide.

I could have watched this and skipped a year of public high school education easily.  It made me energized to go out and look into some of the topics it discussed too.

Worth the money.",1366502400,3,722,4.233576642335766
