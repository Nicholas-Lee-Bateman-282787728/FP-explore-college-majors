These guys are definitely onto something, their main characters Ed Beggins, Hundred Fold, and Mr. Grungy are hilarious. Great ensemble cast, as they probe a lot of funny situations about the inner-city life and pop culture as well.

Definitely recommend it if your looking for laughs.",1333584000,,388,5.344262295081967
