7793489,5,0940871181,"This is DVD a rare jewel. Created in the mid '80s through Black Belt Magazine.
This is my second copy over the past 20 yrs!  Hard to find...

Tai Chi Chuan is more than just a series of positions and movement.
But if that's all you are looking for just buy the lesser priced book ""Tai Chi Chuan:The 27 Forms"" or look elsewhere.

Here Master Marshall Ho'o himself along with amazing student Victoria Mallory, provide simple yet intimate instruction/example for this 1,000 year old Chinese YANG school, Soft-style martial art along with insight gained over decades.
They seamlessly evoke the Taoist principle of non-doing and the Buddhist principle of serenity and mind/body awareness, while strengthening and relaxing the entire body.
Includes Short Form, Temple Exercises, Intro to Push Hands and Self-Defense applications! 90 minutes in all!
Appropriate for any age!",1519776000,,867,5.178571428571429
7793490,3,0940871181,"This is okay. Sifu Yang knows his material, but perhaps he tried to cover too much territory. He did have some good moves to add to my routines.",1509840000,,144,4.178571428571429

7793493,5,0940871181,Ok for anyone that would love to learn Tai Chi Chuan this is it man they give you the history and the science behind it and he really goes really slow so you can fallow along I give this a 10 all day long a must have.,1380240000,3,217,3.6382978723404253
7793494,5,0940871181,"Would recommend to both beginner and as a refresher for those practicing Tai Chi Chuan.
Provides a full routine as well as a section by section front view and rear view of the entire routine.
Great for beginners as I am.",1374105600,,220,4.390243902439025
7793495,5,0940871181,"This is one of the first instructional DVDs on the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and remains one of the best if not the best. The performance of the form is outstanding, and the history and theory are presented in a clear and concise manner.
Many Tai Chi forms are done in such a way you can observe primarily relaxation and flowing movements. When you watch master Liang you will notice a great combination of soft and hard, slow and bursting energy. The nature scene is lovely, and the Chinese music used for the movie is fascinating. The form itself contains many elements that will create a thorough physical workout.",1336003200,5,613,4.581818181818182
7793496,5,0940871181,"I did receive this dvd shortly after I received the book.  I am sorry it is no longer available.  It is wonderful to practice Tai Chi again with Marshall Ho'o, I first saw him back in the 1960's or 70's on PBS.  He shows the temple exercises, and the Tai Chi short form, and an alternative movement to ""snake creeps down"" for those with a knee injury.
  All I could possibly ask for would be a kind of indexing to choose either Temple exercises, the instructions on the movements or complete Tai Chi.  But none of that changes the love I have for this DVD.
  Let's hope that they put the DVD back on the market :)",1225238400,5,613,4.17948717948718
7793497,2,0940871181,"First, a word of warning.  The DVD release date and the production date are not the same.  The footage actually dates from 1981, and let me tell you, it hasn't aged well.  Fans of really hokey martial arts films from the 70s would probably really appreciate the kitsch aspect, but I personally found it tiresome after about 5 minutes.

The strong point of the DVD is the actual presentation of the Tai forms by M. Liang.  It's a clear presentation of how the forms should look, although it still (obviously) doesn't replace a live instructor who can give you a 3-D view and tell you what you need to do differently.  I was also disappointed to see the forms called by different names than I had previously heard used, but that's probably b/c I only ever had 1 instructor and I got used to her vocab.

However, the truly unbearable part of this DVD is the voice-over that describes the various details of the forms (hand positions, foot placement, etc.) which is shown just before the presentation of the forms themselves.  It's a bit of a pity, since Tai Chi relies heavily on the details and it really is necessary to watch this several times.  Also the music throughout seems to have come from a bad porn film.

This isn't what I was expecting, and I wouldn't buy it again.",1106352000,18,1275,4.504347826086956
7793498,5,0940871181,"A solid video of the Yang Form and applications. Although the locks were present, the strong fajings were not thoroughly illustrated. Nonetheless, a great resource.",1048118400,4,164,5.6
