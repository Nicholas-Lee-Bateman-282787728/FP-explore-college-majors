8338531,4,B001RPZE0I,Good insight into who Tolkien was an is. Even having read all his books there is more to learn.,1443657600,,95,4.052631578947368
8338532,5,B001RPZE0I,I gave this gift to a family member for their birthday and therefore have not had a chance to critique this DVD in all fairness to its intrinsic qualities. Others have given this DVD mixed reviews and I would need to view it to adequately give it a positive or a negative review.,1443139200,,279,4.283018867924528
8338533,5,B001RPZE0I,"Important features of his genius and his sharing of it with the world.  Incredible life, incredible story that should be shared with everyone. He belonged to all ages, all cultures and peoples of our planet.  An almost otherworldly being.  The biography  promotes a more than superficial appreciation for him as a gift to generations for generations to come.  It leads one to know  so much more of this superior person.",1410998400,,419,4.914285714285715
8338534,5,B001RPZE0I,"They did it before and they do again this time with this documentary.  Much like ""An Unauthorized Biography"", this version is right up the information.",1389916800,,151,5.04
8338535,5,B001RPZE0I,"With grandchildren anxious for the release The Hobbit film (14 December 2012, Warner Bros/Peter Jackson), I needed to brush up on all things Tolkien! First, read The Hobbit again after so many years ... done. Then study the many Tolkien documentaries ... choose one to share with those grandchildren ... done. And this one is my choice! I was influenced no doubt by the children featured as they discuss Bilbo Baggins, the magic ring of invisibility, etceteras.

Similar to a college 101 elective course, this presentation is a fine, telling introduction of so many facets of Tolkien. It may hook a serious student to dig deeper; it may satisfy others as quite a sufficient overview.",1355702400,3,683,4.939130434782609
8338536,3,B001RPZE0I,"Some parts of this video may seem a bit hokey, and even funny.  I hadn't known that the Beatles had planned on starring in a Lord of the Rings movie - thank goodness they didn't!  But there are some primary words and interviews with Tolkien here - not very long, but some precious insights to his mind.  This video covers in some detail how Tolkien began writing the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.  It describes Tolkien's literary fascination, and his amazing capacity to invent new languages.  That in itself was fascinating.  The movie was made before the Peter Jackson films, so don't buy it expecting special effects.  It is a brief, but informative documentary.",1318723200,3,669,4.7155172413793105
8338537,1,B001RPZE0I,"This has to be one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. On top of being a low budget, ridiculously shallow look at Tolkien, the brand new copy I bought skipped. I have returned it.",1292371200,,188,4.25
