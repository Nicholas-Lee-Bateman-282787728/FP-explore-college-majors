2963960,5,B000WBZ5YI,"This purchase went smoothly.  Now this is ALL I get to watch thanks to my children.  My husband cannot stand all the cartoons our children are watching, he wants to watch some adult T.V.  This is no big deal for me.  It is not worth fighting about.  I have become immune to all these cartoons watched over and over and over and over.  I wanted to be a parent!  This is great!  They love it!

Thanks!

They are not as interesting to me as an adult, but I can say that some of the information is very accurate.  Although I didn't buy them as learning DVDs for my kids and expected them to be only for entertainment, the kids still pick up some interesting information!

2964075,5,B000WBZ5YI,"Sadly, the third season of What's New Scooby-Doo? is the last season. What gets to me is how alot of these cartoon programs get their legs to stand on by the third season, only to have the show stopped(Batman Beyond, for instance). This show was really starting to get lots better with each season. This season has the gang visiting locales such as: Paris, Moscow, Hong Kong, Australia, and the Old West as well as seeing them in a number of sports-themed settings. Again, the show is voiced by Casey Kasem, Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle and Mindy Cohn. My favorite episodes from this season are: Go West-Young Scoob, Wrestle Maniacs, Camp Comeoniwannascareya, and Gentlemen, Start Your Monsters. Extras include a bonus Scooby-Doo Christmas Episode. I really enjoy the show and really wish that they hadn't stopped it. Until this show, I never really thought Scoob was all that cool. What was so great about it is they had celebrity guest-stars on the show like: Kiss, Taylor Lautner(of Twilight fame),Smash Mouth, Simple Plan and JC Chasez.

I'm glad I bought all three seasons of What's New, Scooby Doo?. If you're a big Scooby Doo fan, you should get this. Really you should.",1261872000,5,1175,4.845771144278607

3198572,5,B000WBZ5YI,"Sadly, the third season of What's New Scooby-Doo? is the last season. What gets to me is how alot of these cartoon programs get their legs to stand on by the third season, only to have the show stopped(Batman Beyond, for instance). This show was really starting to get lots better with each season. This season has the gang visiting locales such as: Paris, Moscow, Hong Kong, Australia, and the Old West as well as seeing them in a number of sports-themed settings. Again, the show is voiced by Casey Kasem, Frank Welker, Grey DeLisle and Mindy Cohn. My favorite episodes from this season are: Go West-Young Scoob, Wrestle Maniacs, Camp Comeoniwannascareya, and Gentlemen, Start Your Monsters. Extras include a bonus Scooby-Doo Christmas Episode. I really enjoy the show and really wish that they hadn't stopped it. Until this show, I never really thought Scoob was all that cool. What was so great about it is they had celebrity guest-stars on the show like: Kiss, Taylor Lautner(of Twilight fame),Smash Mouth, Simple Plan and JC Chasez.

I'm glad I bought all three seasons of What's New, Scooby Doo?. If you're a big Scooby Doo fan, you should get this. Really you should.",1261872000,5,1175,4.845771144278607
