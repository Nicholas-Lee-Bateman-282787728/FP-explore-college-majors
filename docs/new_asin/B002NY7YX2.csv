8375600,5,B002NY7YX2,Excellent performance by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by James Levine. If your are a fan of the music composed by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss you will certainly enjoy this in the park concert. I found the DVD sound quality to be very good. The DVD was ordered after viewing the concert on Medici.tv.,1301961600,5,311,4.777777777777778
8375601,1,B002NY7YX2,"This DVD was a HUGE disappointment.  The promise of an exciting and wonderful concert by the magnificent James Levine turned out to be a farce.  The fault was NOT with the Berlin Philharmoniker or the conductor, but with the sound engineer, who had a mind of his own.  Like old-time radio engineers, who pulled back the loud sections of music, he (or she) decided that some sections of the music were just too much for home listeners to stand.  I have hundreds of DVDs, many of the Berlin Philharmoniker, and none of them have this problem.  The excitement of the music was destroyed by the distortion of the music and its dynamics.  I am certain that Levine and certainly not the producers of this DVD are aware of the problem i have
described.  It never should have been released.  It is not the fault of my DVD player or sound system.  Three friends also have
complained to me of the same thing.",1262736000,17,898,4.493827160493828
