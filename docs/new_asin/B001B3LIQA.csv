3481723,5,B001B3LIQA,"As engaging as Michael Palin is, as effortlessly as he befriends a host of people representing a host of cultures, as entertaining as most of his interactions are, there are  times nevertheless when a good director and editor would have done wonders for the series.  I don't fault Palin himself for this - after all, you can't just barge in on total strangers then excuse yourself when it suits you: you simply have to wait for the opportune moment to make your exit.  I do, however, fault the director.  Two glaring examples of this much too lengthy focus on indigenous hospitality: 1) as another reviewer already noted, Palin incessantly stirring a big pot of cheese in ""Himalaya""; and 2) Palin joining a Russian filmmaker for dinner over an endless round of homemade vodka toasts in ""Pole to Pole.""  These two scenes went on way too long - which, in fact, graphically demonstrates the delicately fragile line the traveler - Palin - must walk when featuring the people and culture of a particular place more prominently than the place itself.  I'll admit it took awhile for Palin's approach to win me over because I absolutely love geography, and would prefer focusing first and foremost on the terrain itself then on the cities and towns and, only then, on the people.  But as I grew increasingly more comfortable with Palin's unique approach - not that of an anthropologist but of an extravagently outgoing man eager to meet new people - I came to appreciate that approach as something to be valued in its own right.  But on those occasions when the human interaction started to grate on the nerves, or the ceremonies, sporting events and nights out on the town tended to crowd out the splendor of the scenery or the fascination of the setting, I found myself wondering if my time and money might have been better spent elsewhere - but only on those very rare occasions.  For the most part, Palin's focus on the people of a particular region proved absolutely crucial to the overall enjoyment of the series, the notabe exceptions being ""Confessions of a Trainspotter,"" (1 episode) which featured the English and Scottish countryside; and its follow-up ""From Derry to Kerry,"" (1 episode) which was quite noteworthy, not only for its presentation of the magnificent coast of Ireland but also in its depiction of battle-scarred Derry (Londonderry) and Belfast.

My favorite two entries in the collection are ""Sahara"" (4 episodes) and ""Himalaya"" (6 episodes); and my favorite individual episodes are #3 from ""Sahara"" and #5 from ""Himalaya.""  In episode 3, which includes the most grueling part of Palin's entire ""Sahara"" journey - a camel caravan from Ingal to Bilma, both oasis towns in the nation of Niger - he establishes a truly remarkable rapport with members of the caravan - so much so that, when he parts their company, there is a genuine sense of losing a friend who will never be seen again.  In episode 5 of ""Himalaya"" Palin visits Majuli Island in the Bramaputra River which houses a Hindu monastery where the monks are devoted almost entirely to artistic endeavors - and where the sense of serenity surpasses even that evoked by the Buddhist monasteries of Nepal and Bhutan.  Even the opening credits and music of these two series are a sheer delight.

Another favorite episode is #4 from ""Pole to Pole"" (8 episodes).  It's entitled ""Shifting Sands"" and deals exclusively with Palin's journey southward through Sudan - a dangerous place to be at that time (and perhaps any time).  It's not so much an enjoyable as it is an informative episode; and though it includes an endless series of vehicle break-downs, these are not instances of focusing too much on one thing but rather of stressing the genuinely grueling trek along Sudan's very, very primitive roads.  In that respect, the viewer is as happy as Palin was to get to the Ethiopian border - which he hadn't planned on but which the dangerous conditions of southern Sudan necessitated.  The journey through Tanzania and Kenya - both of which were also detours owing to the conditions in southern Sudan - gets extremely short-shrift in episodes #5 and #6 of ""Pole to Pole"".  Almost nothing is shown of Dodoma, the capital of Tanzania; and Nairobi, capital of Kenya - with a population of 3 million the largest city of East Africa - is presented almost like a small backwater town.  But it was more than made up for in episode #7, when a 6000 mile last minute detour took them to Punta Arenas, Chile, then finally on the the South Pole.

Surprisingly - and quite refreshingly - Michael Palin has kept a reasonbly low profile throughout most of his journeys, despite his natural exuberance.  Where this dynamic breaks down the result is ""too much of a good thing.""  In ""Full Circle"" (8 episodes) Palin's ego is given free reign, and the series suffers somewhat for it.  For example, instead of showing us something of Vladivostok (one of the most intriguing cities of the world), he shows us the Russian Naval Band - with himself positioned as a member of its choir for one song.  And his point of entry into Japan has him taking a lesson in beating a huge drum.  In Korea he takes a rather pointless detour to the demilitarization zone, joining a group of tourists in stepping around a table into North Korea but returning to South Korea around the other end of the table.  In Australia, he joins in a camel hunt and in New Zealand in a college hazing - neither of which adds to the thrill of the journey.  ""Full Circle"" does, however, contain a truly magnificent episode - #3, which features Palin's journey through China.  This is an absolutely ""must see"" spectacle that focuses more on the cities, towns and landscape of China than on its people.  From Palin's entry into China at Quingdao; to his tour of Shanghai's financial district; to his boating trip up the Yangtze River through the Three Gorges, where he visits a city destined to be buried beneath two hundred feet of water; to his stop at Chongquing, China's most populous city, which rises through a deep river fog; and on to the Vietnamese border - this is as wonderful a presentation of China as any I've ever seen (including BBC's ""Wild China"").  The same, however, cannot be said of Australia and New Zealand.  In fact, of all the strange and bizarre people, sights and customs along the Pacific Rim, none were stranger or more bizarre than those of these two former British colonies.  Episodes 7 & 8 of ""Full Circle"" stand almost as tall as episode 3 in pure grandeur, #7 showing Punta Arenas and the Atacama Desert, #8 showing Cusco & Machu Pichu plus the truly sublime Pongo de Mainique canyon along Urubamba River in Peru (which Palin has called his ""favourite place in the world"").

""Around The World In 80 Days"" (7 episodes) should be subtitled ""The Michael Palin Show.""  This is not a criticism; it's a tribute to Michael Palin's ability to completely captivate his audience.  This series is as close to a ""Nothing to see here"" show as possible - because almost every waking moment is spent desperately trying to secure transportation to the next leg of the journey around the world - at least one instance self-induced when Palen decides to sighsee in the Rockies.  Were it not for Palin's personality this series would fall apart after the first episode.  So, instead of limiting the focus on Palin (as I suggested should have been done in ""Pole to Pole"" and ""Full Circle""), if anything this series should have given him even freer reign.  Episode #3 - ""Ancient Mariners"" - besides being far and away the best of this particular series, anticipates Episode #3 from ""Sahara"" in depicting the remarkable comaradarie Palin develops with the crew of the Dhow, which takes 8 days to cross the Arabian Sea from Dubai to Bombay, India; every single frame of this boat ride is pure magic.

As other reviewers have noted, ""Hemingway Adventure"" (4 episodes) doesn't seem to fit the pattern of Palin's other journeys.  And little wonder.  Looking at even the most interesting places through the single lens of another person's life renders them little more than picture postcards - the entire trek becomes a hunt for that person's haunts.  Spain is reduced to bullfighing, Kenya and Uganda to big game hunting, Cuba to marlin fishing.  Such a journey becomes an exercise in ""All Dressed Up With Nowhere To Go.""  The playwrite Ibsen's famous dictum ""We Sail With A Corpse In Our Cargo"" comes to mind.  Even Michael Palin's natural charm and exuberance - which have carried many an otherwise ho-hum segment - have been toned down in this series.  Best advice: when you start out on a trip, be it a thousand miles or a single step, leave your heroes at home.

""New Europe"" (7 episodes) features the countries of Eastern Europe and those formed after the break-up of the Soviet Union.  It begins in the Balkans, in the six countries comprising the former Yugoslavia; from there going to Albania. All through this 1st episode - except for Belgrade, the only major city untouched by the wars of the 90's - there's an ever-present sense of decay; of trying to regain a once proud heritage; and of hope that, after the yoke of Soviet domination has finally lifted, and the ethnic wars have finally ended, life will be better.  From there, Palin goes through Macedonia and Bulgaria into Western Turkey.  Episode #2 features a fascinating tour of Edime, just inside the Turkish border; plus another look at Istambul.  And the most wonderful, enchanting sight encountered in the entire Michael Palin Collection - a place called Cappadocia on a snowy plateau in central Turkey, filled with cave dwellings cut into ancient volcanic pillars - a place even more sublime than Pongo de Mainique from ""Full Circle.""  Episode #3 takes Palin into Moldova and Romania, both superb sequences; then on down the Danube.  Episode #4 focuses first on Hungary and then on the Ukraine, where Palin makes a return visit to Kiev.  Episode #5 takes him to the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania plus the city-state of Kaliningrad - an odd piece of Russia clinging to the Baltic Sea with no land bridge to the mother country.  Episode #6 takes Palin through Poland, from the Baltic port of Gdansk down to Warsaw and Krakow and, finally, down the Vah River into Slovakia.  Episode #7 very briefly features the Tatras Mountains of Slovakia then proceeds to the Czech Republic and the city of Prague then along the Elbe River to ""East"" Germany, highlighting Dresden and Berlin before ending at Rugen Island.

It's easy to sum all this up.  Cappadocia and Pongo de Mainique alone are more than worth the price of admission to this captivating travel collection.  And they're just the tip of the iceberg.",1343260800,2,10710,4.782301845819761
3481724,5,B001B3LIQA,"I recommend this set of videos to anyone who likes travel and documentary films.  This film series was made over the last 30 years, and some things have changed, but the narrator's positive energy and the BBC's fine photography carry the day regardless.  I always finish a video feeling more enlightened and happier than when I started watching it. - JL",1332115200,,353,4.770491803278689
3481725,5,B001B3LIQA,"What a great Collection of travel documetaries! Who would have thought that a Monty Python member would turn out to be in my opinion the best most entertaining travel documentarian in the business. From the first time I had seen (1980) his one hour travel episode on the BBC series Great Railway Journeys where he traveled from London to Scotland by train I was hooked. This compilation of his journeys to date is compelling, fun and insightful. Many have copied his style, none have come close. If you are a fan of travel, culture and our beautiful world get this series! You will not regret it and probably do what I have... Watch it over and over!",1330128000,,650,4.564102564102564
3481726,5,B001B3LIQA,"Ever since I can remember as growing up watching this first ever travelogue...with the very funny Michael Palin from the Monty Python and A Fish Called Wanda fame, it brings back memories of yesteryear almost 15 years ago. If you want to find a relaxing weekend lazy getaway with a funny tour guide and not interested in all that rehashed broadcast of cable and satellite TV, do I have the perfect suggestion....watch this travel series. Although a bit outdated now these days, the series does have its fine moments. Although, I only remember seeing Around the World In Eighty Days, can't wait to see Palin's other travel guide series. With a discounted price on its collection, a real gem for DVD-collecting.",1302912000,4,709,4.867768595041323

This is a beautifully packaged boxed set, and the extras on the DVDs are interesting, intriguing, and enlightening, especially the newer Michael Palin interviews. I highly recommend this collection.",1296259200,6,510,5.011764705882353
3481728,5,B001B3LIQA,"I have been living in Colombia for the last 17 years and can affirm that Michael Palin has given a fair and balanced account of this country - the beauty, the joys and the problems.  He even went to places I have never gone to and wouldn't even dare to go.  Very impressive !  There must have gone huge work in the preparation of each of those trips.  In general, this is a fantastic travel experience, going around the globe three times, in several ways : the 80 days path laid out in the novel by Jules Verne, a full circle around all the countries bordering the Pacific, and from pole to pole.  Complementary to that, the Sahara, the Himalaya and the New Europe experiences result in nearly all countries of the world being visited, sometimes twice.  If I would make a critical observation, it would only be that I would love to see the many hours of film that didn't make it even to the ""deleted scenes"" of the series, which are all of the same high quality of the series itself.

What Michael Palin accomplishes here - although unintended - is what Albert Kahn did a century ago, when he produced a color photographic record of human life on Earth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dawn-of-the-Color-Photograph-Albert-Kahn-s-Archives-of-the-Planet/dp/0691139075/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dawn of the Color Photograph: Albert Kahn's Archives of the Planet</a>, believing that in this way he would promote cross-cultural understanding and peace.  This is a great idea and is certainly achieved by this series too.  The lesson is that we are all the same race, a global brotherhood of human beings.  What I like so much about Michael Palin is that he is so easygoing, making friends all over the globe, and connecting to all his fellow human beings with a smile, the same way the Dalai Lama told him in India he also always does.  Palin is genuinely curious to know how everybody lives and divert themselves.  On top of that, he is a great comedian, and will take advantage of any possible situation to find something to make fun out.  Even when he's suffering, he makes fun of it, for instance when he was having trouble climbing the Annapurna, 60 years old at the time : ""It's the work.  I do need the work...""  Wonderful !",1294012800,,2277,4.893229166666667
3481729,5,B001B3LIQA,"This is a collection of all of the BBC presentations of the travel adventures of Michael Palin. The one fly in the ointment is the one about New Europe. In this one he concentrates on unique people. (Read that looney tunes eccentrics.) These are not entertaining for me. I have in my 65 years met too many strange people. One example from this set is an overweight homosexual transvestite gypsy night club singer that sings very poorly in a foreign language I cannot understand. Then there are interviews with people who admire the former Soviet domination of their country and wish that it would occur again. Then there are strange religious groups with strange practices.

3481731,5,B001B3LIQA,"""The Michael Palin Collection"" compiles together all of the travel series Palin has made over the past 20+ years.  Previously best known as part of the Monty Python comedy troupe, Palin brings an easy wit and disarming everyman style to the programs, as he journeys through some of the most remarkable places on earth.  What's particularly notable is how decidedly apolitical Palin's approach is; he simply meets ordinary people, most of whom do not seem to see him as any sort of celebrity, and has as many experiences as he can.

The series sets are identical to the versions available separately, and can be somewhat divided into two types, with the earlier series being more focused on the process of getting from one place to another, and later series being somewhat more traditional travel documentaries as Palin explores a particular region.  There are eight series in all:

""Around the World in Eighty Days""  7 episodes on 3 discs
This is the series that started it all (though not the earliest program in the collection), and the standard by which all subsequent series are measured.  Palin sets out to approximate the famous journey in Jules Verne's novel, keeping strictly to surface transportation.  Unfortunately, the timetable overwhelms the locations, and thus he rarely has time to even see where he is before making the next urgent connection.  This is particularly notable near the end; the United States seems given a particularly perfunctory examination, crammed into the last episode with two ocean voyages and the last miles traveled to London.  A highlight of the series is a slow journey across the Bay of Bengal on an ancient vessel called a dhow; many people consider it the best sequence in any of the series.
WARNING: At one point Palin visits a restaurant that specializes in snake meat, and during the sequence, a snake is skinned alive on camera.  Even non-animal-lovers will likely find the scene disturbing.
The only bonus feature is a years-later interview with Palin, who offers anecdotes and insights about the journey and the production of the series.

""Pole to Pole""  8 episodes on 3 discs
While not necessarily the most ambitious journey (""Full Circle"" beats it for sheer scale), this is almost certainly the most arduous, as Palin journeys from the North Pole to the South Pole along the 30th parallel (with a couple of unavoidable divergences).  In addition to reaching the two lethally inhospitable Poles, Palin travels through western Russia literally days before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and down eastern Africa through countries where just getting anywhere seems almost impossible.  Despite - or perhaps because of - these obstacles, ""Pole to Pole"" is arguably the best of all the series, balancing a chronicle of the journey with an experience of the locations often lacking in ""Around the World.""  Highlights are many, but one standout is the journey through Sudan aboard the Nile Valley Express, during which Palin even rides on the roof of the train as it lumbers through the desert.
As with ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" the only bonus feature is an interview with Palin.

""Full Circle""  10 episodes on 3 discs
On his most epic journey, Palin travels around the circumference of the Pacific Rim, a trip that takes him a full year.  The series indicates the beginning of a shift away from focusing on the journey, as was required in ""Around the World"" and (somewhat) artificially recreated in ""Pole to Pole,"" and more toward appreciating the diverse places visited.  While more of a focus on the destination is welcome, the reduction of footage of the various rail, ship and other surface transportation modes results in a series that feels somewhat disjointed, and some regions are bypassed entirely.  This includes, unfortunately, much of the western United States, which is shortchanged again; it may be that the US was considered too familiar to the audience to merit more than cursory attention.  In any case, many sequences are striking.  A highlight is the time spent in Eastern Russia, where Palin pays a haunting visit to the ruins of a Soviet gulag accompanied by one of the former prisoners, as well as a visit to the spectacular geothermal basin in the Kronotsky Reserve, a place that has never been visited by more than a handful of people.
Bonus features include an interview similar to those on the previous sets, and a series of deleted scenes, few of which could be considered a great loss from the broadcast episodes.

""Hemingway Adventure"" / ""Great Railway Journeys""  6 episodes/programs on 2 discs
This set consists of two completely different series, both quite different from all the others.
""Hemingway Adventure,"" the next series created after Full Circle, and the first filmed in high definition, or at least widescreen, does not chronicle Palin's journeys from one location to another.  Rather, he visits many of the locations around the world that were significant in the life of the author Ernest Hemingway.  Beyond this thematic element, no attempt is made to give coherence to the different locations, not even biographical - for instance, Palin doesn't visit Hemingway's boyhood home until the second episode.  The result, while presenting a number of very interesting places, including Cuba and Uganda, seems almost random, and is probably the weakest of all the series, though it probably has more value to serious Hemingway fans.  There are no bonus features.
The two programs on disc 2 are episodes of the series ""Great Railway Journeys"" featuring Palin.  The first ""Confessions of a Trainspotter,"" dates back to 1980, a full decade prior to ""Around the World,"" and follows Palin as he journeys from the south of England to the far north of Scotland via a series of different rail lines.  While lacking the style and narrative flow of his later series, the episode is still interesting, appealing particularly to the train buffs who would make up a large part of the series audience.  The other episode, ""Kerry to Derry,"" filmed between ""Pole to Pole"" and ""Full Circle,"" follows Palin around Ireland as he attempts to track his great grandmother's emigration to the United States.  This seems a thin thread to hang the episode on, and doesn't ever amount to much, but still the program has its rewards, including quite of bit of time spent in Northern Ireland examining the conditions of the Troubles.  Again, there are no bonus features, making this disc's content particularly light.

""Sahara""  4 episodes on 2 discs
This series is a return to the single-journey format of the first three series, but from now on the emphasis is much less on the journey than on the destination.  Palin travels around the Sahara Desert, which he points out is quite close to Europe yet almost entirely unknown to most Europeans.  He pays particular attention to meeting people, and the region emerges as far more colorful than one might expect.  The unstable political conditions in areas such as Western Sahara are not ignored, but, as always, Palin simply observes rather than making any sort of explicit statement.  Highlights include a magnificent mud-built mosque in Djenne, and a journey across a particularly unforgiving stretch of desert with a camel caravan; this sequence is the closest any series has come to recreating the feel of the dhow sequence in ""Around the World,"" though a couple of incongruous interruptions diminish the effect.  Unfortunately, the series as a whole lacks the sense of cohesion of that earlier series, as Palin's path around the Sahara seems almost random at times.
Bonus features include the usual informative post-series interview, a number of interesting deleted sequences, and a series of brief clips called ""video diaries,"" that offer Palin's on the spot comments about some of the experiences he's having.

""Himalaya""  6 episodes on 3 discs
It's fair to say this is the most visually spectacular series, as Palin visits a range of locales throughout the vast mountainous region; the cinematography, which is exceptional in all the series, is nothing short of breathtaking as shot after shot of impossibly beautiful natural features merge with footage of truly glorious architectural wonders.  Similarly, much has been said about the musical soundtrack, a remarkable blending of traditional motifs and contemporary Western arrangements that somehow always works.  In many ways this feels to be the most perilous journey, as Palin deals with hostile climate, where altitude sickness can be fatal, and equally hostile political conditions, such as the contentious relations between Pakistan and India, insurgent groups in Nepal, and the simmering Chinese occupation of Tibet.  On that subject, Palin has an intriguing interview with the exiled Dalai Lama, but also seems willing to accept the ever-present Chinese control while in Tibet.  No doubt some will object to his lack of political agenda, being satisfied with nothing less than seeing him wear a ""Free Tibet!"" t-shirt, but that's not how these programs work.
A highlight is a lengthy walking journey to the high altitude Anapurna region, where Palin carries on valiantly despite being quite ill.  On the other hand, an extended sequence with a yak farmer (really!) and his family seems intended to evoke the dhow sequence again, but far too much time is spent seeing Palin stirring some sort of gruel in a large pot, churning butter, and making small talk to a group of people none of whom understand a word he is saying.  Too much time is also spent chronicling a polo match in Pakistan and a horse show in Tibet.
Bonus features include the expected post-program interview, and a wealth of deleted scenes, some of which are as fascinating as anything in the series, and would have been welcomed instead of the above-mentioned time-killers.  Also included is the only instance of a pre-trip interview, where Palin reflects on what he is about to undertake.  Unlike the other interviews, this one doesn't offer much value.

""New Europe""  7 episodes on 3 discs
You wouldn't think Eastern Europe would be as compelling as the more exotic places Palin visits in previous journeys; you'd be wrong.  Palin takes advantage of rapidly changing conditions to become acquainted with countries that not too long ago were hidden behind the Iron Curtain.  As in the previous three series, there is the lack of a sense of a coherent travel route, as location changes at times seem almost random; at one point Palin jumps from Ukraine to the northern Baltic region.  But, as always, the places visited are fascinating, and Palin's winning everyman style serves him particularly well, as he asks people's views about the end of Communism and Soviet influence and the growth of the European Union.  He also renews contact with people he met years before on previous journeys.  Amusingly, where the two previous series offered stunning natural beauty, this time the cinematographers seem most interested in a different kind of beauty, and miss no opportunity to point the cameras at an endless number of pretty girls.  This series is definitely easy on the eyes.
Bonus features include a large number of deleted scenes, often as interesting as the series itself, and an interview that is oddly split into to two parts over two discs.  Unlike in previous sets, the interview is not particularly in depth, only discussing the locations seen in the first few episodes.

Overall ""The Michael Palin Collection"" is a set well worth having.  It's a look at some of the least known areas of the world (at least to the West), and Palin is an infectiously enthusiastic guide and fellow traveler.  Even people who don't care for travel documentaries may find these programs refreshingly down to earth and just plain fun.",1240012800,104,11773,5.0334878928387425
3481732,5,B001B3LIQA,"Over a period of about three years, I took my time watching pretty much the entire series, taking everything in, and savouring every moment! Even now, I still have yet to watch the Hemingway section, though I've watched all of the truly in-depth, gruelling, pain staking, dangerous, yet often fun, and truly beautiful, sometimes even exciting, journeys!
Better yet, Even though I'd seen ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""Pole to Pole"" years ago on PBS, I'd never seen any of the others! Even after all these years, those two still look great, but better still, with each succeeding adventure, the quality (visual, sound, music and other technological advances) gets better and better, the beauty more spectacular, the dangers more risky, and the occasional humour from Michael even funnier! Some of the stunning landscape in ""Himalaya"" is so drop-dead gorgeous and beautiful, you may find yourself wishing you could go there! Well, this is the next best thing! Michael and crew have obviously spent a great deal of time and energy on each journey, and you almost feel the fatigue of having traversed such a journey yourself, by the end of each one!
More than any other travel documentary I've ever seen, I felt almost as though I were travelling along! It certainly helps when, (right from the very beginning), Michael takes us with him to do a little research for the first journey, then to talk with travel agents, and even get up in the morning with him to pack, and then be seen off by family and friends. And from then on, you're on a journey all over the world for the next couple of decades! In fact, the last one ""New Europe"", is only a few years old! There were so many times where I wanted to write a review here about so many diverse, and interesting moments from each journey, that I simply couldn't keep up!
Perhaps this weekend I'll start watching the Hemingway one on weekends over the next couple of weeks (I don't like to watch anything for more than two or three hours a night on DVD), and perhaps five years from now I'll watch the whole thing all over again. It's particularly timeless, considering that we get to see the world still very much unspoiled before having become so saturated with modern technology, fast food, etc. It's wonderful that Michael and crew just happened to catch the world just in time, while it still held a certain sense of mystery and adventure not easily accessible.",1239667200,9,2416,4.7004716981132075

3481837,5,B001B3LIQA,I have seen a few of Palin's shows on PBS or Netflix and loved them but always seemed to miss an episode here and there. This has them all on one place. The display box is a bit large but each series has it's own individual DVD case if you want to put them on a shelf that way. For the price I got this at it was an unbelievable bargain.,1418860800,,337,3.76056338028169

3481839,5,B001B3LIQA,"The PALIN TRAVELS are the BEST armchair traveling you will EVER do. Period. The GOLD STANDARD.
I LOVE THESE. Rewatchability?  Oh, hell yes! Just pop in one episode of POLE TO POLE or AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS and you will be hooked, and binge watching. Guaranteed! What an immense pleasure, Palling around with Michael Palin to the far corners of the earth.
Apparently the BBC didn't think Blu rays would increase the definition of the image based on their masters. I find it hard to believe that, but I am fine with this set. I had to search high and low all over Los Angeles back in the day to just RENT these. So to get them all in one shot is a gift!
Highest Recommendation.

3481842,5,B001B3LIQA,"Years ago I happened across Mr. Palin's Full Circle on PBS. At the time, I had no idea that he had done travel videos. Being a Python fan, I thought that I would stop and watch for a few laughs... Well, now I own the whole set. They are funny, but also very informative. I know that most of these places I will never see, and that they have changed some since he has been there, but I don't care about that. They are still good. I feel as though I have seen them, with him.",1399334400,,473,3.9375
3481883,5,B001B3LIQA,We've watched and enjoyed the Michael Pailn travelogues in print and on TV for years; now we have all of them at our fingertips.  It's fascinating to travel with him in his inimitable self-deprecating way.  And it's also enlightening to see how he -- and the technology -- have progressed over the years.  It's a valuable addition to our DVD library.,1395532800,,350,4.704918032786885
3481884,5,B001B3LIQA,"I watched this series originally with my own children 20 years.  We would rush home to finish homework, eat dinner and take our baths.  Then we would settle down with our Grampa and enjoy Michael Palin taking us to the week's newest adventure.  Michael Palin was our brother on an adventure.  We were so excited to take the trip with him.  It was so sad when the series was over and there seemed to be nothing else to discover!  What a wonderful, magical time for us as a family.  We truly were happy then.  Now I have precious grandchildren and have found this set.  Guess who is going to pass this on to her grandbabies so more memories can be created?  I hope I get to share them from time to time when I get to visit and I we are lucky enough to still have our Grampa with us.  I hope he will be with us too.  This is an investment that means so much more than another IPad, Gameboy, or whatever new techie thing kids want these days.",1391212800,,938,4.15
3481885,4,B001B3LIQA,We love his style in travel perspective.  It is so much fun to experience these places through his excursions and sense of humor.  We have watched with our parents and children.  All with something to gain.  You see the sights and talk to the people. He likes to talk to the locals.,1389052800,,282,4.365384615384615
3481886,4,B001B3LIQA,"I've been watching Palin's travels again and again since the very first Round the World adventure in about 1990; and I never tire of them. He brings a wry, humorous touch to everything he witnesses and does, and is a charming travel companion. Once in a while the Palinesque capering is a bit much, but capering and being silly is what made him famous, isn't it? I cycle through the shows every three or four years; currently just finishing up Sahara, with Brazil coming my way soon. If you like a gentle, humorous, but always open-minded POV in your nonfiction TV, you owe it to yourself to experience this amazing body of work.",1386806400,,629,4.575221238938053
3481887,5,B001B3LIQA,"What can one say about this set, apart from they represent near perfection in presentation, content and video photography. I originally watched all but the Hemingway Journey when they were broadcast on BBC 1. When they were first released I loved them so much I bought them all on VHS. Today we can buy them on DVD for less than 25 and watching them again and again they lose non of their original charm.

Each journey captures unexpected moments, unique landscapes, has factual commentary and the odd bit of Python type comedy. Also Palin travels to areas that we are no longer able to see, such as the Yangtze Gorge cities in China, which now lie under water. Every series is fantastic and worth watching. I can think of no weak episode from the whole set. I simply cannot recommend buying this collection enough.

For anyone who is interested in travel documentaries and wants to watch a true Pro in front of the camera, this collection is for you. As close to perfect as you can get.

Highly Recommended.",1375660800,3,1008,4.620111731843576

3481890,5,B001B3LIQA,"I've loved Michael Palin since his Monty Python days, and I've enjoyed all of his travel series. This collection puts them all into one nicely boxed set. I hadn't seen New Europe, and I was pleasantly surprised by how interesting and colourful it was, which was his reaction as well.

Palin is a charming host, always humble, prepared to speak a few words of the local language, listen respectfully, and go for the laugh when that seems appropriate. Sometimes he'll ask tough questions in a friendly way, and he gets answers. There is very little controversy in these series. They're mainly fun, interesting for a bit of culture and local colour, some armchair adventure for the rest of us, seen through the eyes of someone we've known for many years. Sometimes I wish we could spend more time in certain locales or get more depth, but that's not what these are about. All of the journeys Palin has undertaken for the BBC are done with a time constraint, often with restrictions on modes of travel such as no airplanes. The point is to cover the distance and see the vast array of lands and people along a given route, from pole to pole or around the world in 80 days, or his trip around the Pacific.

The earlier series, such as Around the World in 80 Days, hold up well against the more recent shows, and the interviews with Michael Palin provide some background into how the shows were done, some of the challenges faced while filming, and even some personal crises along the way.

The wonderful thing about Michael Palin is his sheer delight in everything. He'll play soccer on the beach with Moroccan teens, try to show the locals a bit about cricket in the Himalaya, sit down with dignitaries or dance with the locals, sometimes do slapstick with children when the language barrier makes any other communication difficult. People react to him with friendliness and openness, because he approaches them the same way. The unifying factor in all of these series is his willingness to be human, which makes all of these shows a delight.

Well worth the money to own this set. I've seen almost all of these shows at least once, and plan to watch them many more times.",1361232000,3,2168,4.638020833333333

At first I thought it was just a fluke thing on the first disk but every single disk weve tried has had multiple freeze-up errors that send us looking for online streaming to be able to finish the episode.
