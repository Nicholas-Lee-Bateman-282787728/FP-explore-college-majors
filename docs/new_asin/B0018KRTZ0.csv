8269936,4,B0018KRTZ0,"Major Ed Dames is a former US Army intelligence officer who ran their psychic warfare operation. Project Stargate (yes, just like the movie) was started by Ingo Swann under the auspices of Gen. Alfred Stubblebine. Dames was trained by the noted psychic Swann and developed a method for predictions called 'Remote Viewing'. (Note: The George Clooney film 'The Men Who Stare at Goats' was a fictionalized account of Stargate)

Basically a set of coordinates is given to a person in a room under controlled circumstances and they 'tap into the planet conciousness' and make crude drawings of what they see, which are then interpreted. This dvd gives a brief overview into this field of endeavor.

It is meant to pique your interest enough to spring for his course and seminars, which will require time, money- and the desire
to involve yourself in what most consider a life changing experience. If you are of such desires this is a good first step...",1367366400,2,947,4.875776397515528
8269937,2,B0018KRTZ0,"There were several points made in the documentary that were not fully explained or explored.  One example would be when they were looking for a missing woman's body.  They claim to have found the bodies location, and the reinactment shows Ed Dames and his team hiking up a ridge and finding bones...but they never say that they went and actually found bones.  Instead they say that the police would not go and investigate the scene.  I mean, if you actually find human bones as the documentary depicted...then surely the police are going to investigate that.  I just thought it was a bit tricky to add something like that in there when they had no PROOF that their predictions were correct.  They acted as if the claim had validity, but it didn't.  Similarly, several other claims were expected to be taken for fact by the viewer in just the same way.  I just don't understand why they would put these things in the documentary if they didn't have more hard core evidence to support their own argument.  It doesn't validate Ed Dames' ability to remote view or remote viewing in general.  I think this documentary could have been better, for sure.  As someone who is very interested in remote viewing I wouldn't say that I hated it, but I do think that the argument therein should have been more thought out.  It is my sole opinion that it did not do remote viewing justice.",1269648000,14,1373,4.604938271604938
8269938,5,B0018KRTZ0,"I have studied remote viewing from the civilian point of view long after it became available to the public. I wanted to find out more about the open use of this training in the years since it's military adepts were released into public view. I would say that this movie fills the bill quite well.

As someone who has stood beside the martian rover looking at the distant twin peaks and watched the beauty of nighttime Paris without having to pay for an airplane ticket, that I feel once again connected with the comunity of remote viewers through this production.

The warnings of global problems that have appeared in recent years are well taken. Forewarned is forarmed in order to provide needed protection. Also, some of our international neighbors have become overreactive and beligerant. It is good to know what to expect from that direction as well. Clearly there is a continuing need for remote viewing and the special information that it can provide. Hopefully the public and the government can get over their skittishness and deal with the coming problems in an intelligent and sensibile manner using this information vector.

This movie opens up a number of unexpected and valuable ways to anticipate future events. Even if you discount the accuracy of these predictions it is far better to pay attention to these reports than to live in the dark. The creators of this movie have done us all a valuable service in at least getting us all to think outside the box. Welcome to the 21st century and the wonders of the future. If you expect to prosper, open your eyes and consider what may come.",1252454400,17,1601,4.751798561151079
