5912196,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"Conventional productions of this classic composition - while performing some great music and vocal arrangements - cannot hold a candle to this over-the-top production. Recorded live, often such events lack sound quality, fading, interference, and other technical glitches but this one is flawless.

Much like being there, you are transported to a surreal ""floating"" stage surrounded by water on all sides. Tastefully executed, the addition of water to an otherwise exciting and animated opera takes a well-coreographed performance and bumps it up a notch (or two...or three). Unlike some Hollywood films that attempt to do the same and fail, this one is classy and impactful creating a lasting impression of what entertainment was like before television or the internet.

I am certain that if you enjoy opera, you will appreciate this unusual twist.  And if you think opera is about fat ladies singing and long, enduring death scenes, you may be pleasantly surprised. The music is superb and mixed at the proper level never outstaging the performers and never detracting from the action. Bravo on this technical and artistic masterpiece.

5912197,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"This production of the Magic Flute is well done.  The singing is marvelous.  The orchestra and conductor are beyond reproach.  The staging on an island with a revolving top that rotates from forest to Temple is excellent imagery and well used.

The Women of the night and the Queen of the Night costumes are fantastical and wonderful.  The white garb of the prince is simple and beautiful.  The priests are imaginatively outfitted.  Papageno is somewhat out of place in modern, cheap, yellow cut off sweat pants, poorly fitting zippered sweat shirt, t shirt, and baseball cap, but the outfit does make him a ""common man"" in the middle of aristocracy.  Papagena's change from old lady to cheerleader complete with the pompoms is a little unsettling, but mates her with Papageno.

This production emphasizes the concept of love conquers all, whether aristocratic or plebeian.  There was very little of the feminism I have seen in other productions.",1393891200,,946,5.006410256410256
5912198,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"This was a fantastic--in every way-- of my most beloved of operas.  I bought the version on vinyl with Karl Boehm nearly 50 years ago, and still play it at times.  The staging and costumes were spectacular in the Bregenz production, and the setting on the lake greatly enhanced the mood of the opera.  Some Mozart purists might be offended by this interpretation, and I guess they can just close  their eyes and listen to the orchestra and singers because the music is good.  Mozart seemed to enjoy a bit of quirkiness, and he  might have been pleased with this performance.  The filming in Blu-ray is beautiful, and for $30 or so, much less expensive than a ticket to see the opera and arrange flights and a hotel.  When more people learn of this version, I should think it would not be easy to keep it in stock.",1393891200,6,813,4.445945945945946
5912199,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"This is an easy review.  DO NOT MISS THIS MAGIC FLUTE!  This is right up there with all the great MAGIC FLUTES wether on DVD or CD.
1) Vocally the cast is faultless.
2) Orchestraly with the Wiener Symphoniker what could go wrong.
3) Patrick Summers is a great conductor for this music.  Nuance might be his forte.
4) The Bregenzer Festspiele has gone all out in every department wether contracting great new, young and exciting talented vocalists who can act or in every area of the arts i.e. Sets, Costumes, Lighting, Puppetry,Video and Sound.
5) Special Effects abound and always add to the Drama.
6) David Pountney has come up with a few new and creative ideas on motivation and their consequences.  Here a creative and well thought out staging truly resolves this opera's dicotomy.  Fantasy and Masonic Ritual.  He and his entire Production Team deserve KUDOS!!!  Set Designer - Johan Engels.  Costume and Puppet Designer - Marie-Jeanne Lecca.  Lighting Designer - Fabrice Kebour all work in perfect harmony and as a great team with an inspired Director.
7) Norman Reinhardt is an elegant voiced Tamino.  Rich and smooth of tone and a fine actor.
8) Bernarda Bobro is a superb Pamina.  Her costume and Ruby Red Shoes remind me of Dorthy in THE WIZARD OF OZ, and it only adds to the fantasy element beautifuly.
9) Ana Durlovski is another in a great line of Queen Of The Nights and vocally of the Dramatic Coloratura ilk.  Her mike once in a while for only a second or two seems to lose focus in her first aria.  High notes are blazing and fired off with abandon.
10) Daniel Schmutzhard is a rich and vibrant voiced Papageno.
11) Denise Beck his enchanting Papagena.
12) Alfred Reiter is a strong Sarastro who stands up well against the competion .
13) This production has not a single weak link or flaw.  It is right up there with the current creative productions by The Paris Opera and The Met.  IT TRULY IS MAGICAL and a Special Effects TOUR DE FORCE!!!  It also musically and vocally holds its head up high in a crowded field; even starting with Thomas Beecham's  historic recording and many more truly great recordings and filmings.
14) There are a few musical cuts: one verse of Sarastro's aria and the Sarastro, Tamino and Pamina Trio and some of the Masonic music.  This was probably done to keep this an one Act performance at 150 minutes. No intermission.
15) Monostatos, The Three Ladies and The Three Geni are all wonderful and the Puppets a true delight.
16) All envolved in making this production available deserve our THANKS and SUPPORT.  It must have cost a fortune.  BRAVI TUTTI !!! The Magic Flute is one of my favorite operas every since I learned Papageno in Grad School-Carnegie Mellon University and I own dozens of Studio and Live Performances both on CD, DVD, and I'm giving my age away here LP with a couple of 78s.  This cast and totally in SINC Performance is right up there tied for first place with a select few!",1386979200,17,2944,4.612284069097889
5912200,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"If it were anywhere else and any other work, you might think that the production here was just a little bit over the top, but this is the floating lake stage in Bregenz and it's Mozart's The Magic Flute, so anything goes really. Set right in the waters of Lake Constance, the opera is performed on the domed back of a giant turtle that is surrounded by three huge dragons, but the stage itself is only half the spectacle. The overture, for example, shows the capture of Pamina, the Queen of the Night looking on horrified as Sarastro, Monostatos and his slaves transport her away on a boat that takes a circuit of the stage. The stage then erupts into life in the battle that ensues, fireworks flying, a serpent winding down the stage to inflate to enormous proportions as the dragon that attacks Prince Tamino. Elsewhere the domed stage revolves, one half sprouting giant inflatable blades of grass or spikes that create a forest and change colour according to the scene, the other half used mainly to create a podium or dais for the grandstanding of The Queen of the Night and for Sarastro.

Another significant feature of the David Pountney's production is the use of larger-than-life puppets for the three ladies (each operated by three puppeteers, reflecting the significance of this number in the work) and for the three boys, while the actual roles are sung off-stage (and all by female singers moreover). There are probably logistical reasons for this, although the stage is accommodating enough for all sorts of activity and numbers of extras and acrobats. If it allows the singers to concentrate on the singing however, well then that's also a benefit, but primarily such decisions appear to be taken for the sake of magic, spectacle and sheer scale. The dancing animals, for example, charmed by Tamino's magic flute, are recreated here through giant glowing eyes in a forest and it works wonderfully. Everything comes together exceptionally well in this way, the principal singers interacting with all the marvellous creations, the whole thing meticulously timed and choreographed.

Just because there is huge importance placed on spectacle and entertainment at Bregenz doesn't mean however that the musical performance or the singing is in any way neglected or relegated to secondary importance. Conducted by Patrick Summers, the small ensemble of the Vienna Symphonic orchestra give a lovely, sensitive reading that captures the translucent beauty of the score and the brightness of its melodies with a lively performance. There are quite a few trims applied in this production and not just to the spoken dialogues (no March of the Priests at the start of Act II, Sarastro's 'In diesen heil'gen Hallen' reduced to second verse only, Sarastro, Pamina and Tamino's trio skipped), seemingly with the intention of allowing the work to be played straight through without an interval. This is perhaps for practical reasons, but there's nothing that seems to compromise the integrity of the work.

There are times also when you think that a high level of fitness, intrepidness, acrobatic agility and a head for heights are more important considerations than singing ability when it comes to casting for Bregenz. For this production, where several performers reportedly ended up in the lake on one or two occasions, you might even add swimming as an important requirement this time, but the singing is marvellous too.  Pamina and Tamino in this production are both warmly engaging, demonstrating the lightness and clarity of tone required for these roles.  The same is true of Daniel Schmutzhard's Papageno and Dnise Beck's Papagena. The more challenging tessitura of Knigen der Nacht and Sarastro are both very capably handled by Ana Durlovski and Alfred Reiter. Martin Koch as Monostatos (wearing a very nearly obscene codpiece), is also good.

As productions of Die Zauberflte go however, the Bregenz production then not only looks and sounds great, it's played perfectly in the spirit of the work. It's rare that you get all those elements coming together in a way that captures the pure vitality, the meaning and the entertainment of the work as well as this, although unquestionably the emphasis here leans more on the entertainment side of the work than the esoteric. The ability to scale the work up for the Bregenz stage works in its favour in this regard, but that also undoubtedly brings other considerable challenges. It's quite an achievement by Summers and Pountney then that this comes across quite as brilliantly as it does.",1380844800,30,4545,5.045272969374167

8605256,4,B00EHDXYJ0,This version of The Magic Flute was very entertaining and different as it was staged around the water. The quality of the video and sound is very good.,1481932800,,151,4.428571428571429
8605257,3,B00EHDXYJ0,"From the floating stage of the Bregenz Festival. Visually very attractive (kids will love it). Singing is just so-so, and there are substantial cuts in the libretto. Most noticeable to me: just one verse of Sarastro's ""In diesen heil'gen Hallen"" is sung, depriving me of much of a favorite aria.",1478390400,,295,4.92

8605259,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"Fantastic! It's not only the spectacle of the great production on Lake Constance, but also the great direction with blocking, using the space well. The singing is spot on. Lighting design is fantastic; video direction is great. The viewer enjoys terrific performances from each major (and minor)  character, especially when you consider that they must not be afraid of heights, or lying down while they sing! In addition, the gals who sing the trios are spot on: their voices are well matched so that the trio singing is beautifully balanced. I don't know German fluently, but I know enough as a singer that their diction is accurate; I have a feeling that those in the audience, who are probably mostly German speakers, fully understood both the dialogue and also singing. The famous ""Queen of the Night aria"" is very exciting, while she sings about 100 feet over the lake. She has guts!  I agree with former reviewers that the singer for the ""bad guy,"" Soroaster, does tend to ""sing in the back"" of his throat; but, frankly, this does not affect the production. This is totally fun! Great costuming; fantastic puppet design and work! I am in awe of the engineering that this production required. Mozart's fairy tale is beautifully done within the context of post-modern creativity! We are not shown on the video where the orchestra is, but members of the Vienna Phil are ""top  notch."" Kudos to the conductor! I highly recommend this Blue Ray.",1460246400,3,1444,4.838056680161944

8605261,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"This is an impressive and extraordinarily fantastic production of this opera, which has never been one of my favorites for its masonic contents.
I do not like Sarastro and his retinue and Papageno is too much. I love Tamino and Pamina and the Queen of the Night does not bother me,
specially with her two big arias. I enjoyed the settings and all the fantasy. Video and Audio are terrific. I hate modern productions of classic operas
but this I do not consider a modern production but an outstanding representation of a classic.",1443398400,5,528,4.688172043010753
8605262,5,B00EHDXYJ0,"Wow! What a welcome change from the usual Magic Flute production. It does not get any more unique than this! Vocals and music are superb and the 1080i HD picture, with fantastic color and wonderful costumes, is great! The audience ambient noise is very quiet. Explosions and fire, where appropriate, make the production very unusual (cannot be done in the usual indoors for obvious reasons). Highly recommended!",1431216000,,411,5.149253731343284
