3093006,1,B0012OTLIA,"This blanket excusal of violence introduces Occupation 101, a film designed to evoke sympathy for Palestinians and contempt for Israel,  which is currently being promoted to schools, churches and activist groups. What follows is ninety minutes of indoctrination. Scenes of squalid refugee camps, Israeli soldiers confronting protesters, despairing Palestinian mothers and teary-eyed children serve as a backdrop to well-rehearsed indictments of the Jewish state by a who's who of anti-Israel activists. Narrator Alison Weir and the producer/director team of Sufyan and Abdallah Omeish present a litany of anti-Zionist canards. The message throughout is that Palestinians are blameless victims while Israelis are entirely responsible for Palestinian violence.

For those of you who respect true civil rights movements, and want to honor the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King should watch this documentary with a very critical eye.  It is offensive that these people equate the American civil rights movement and the effort to ban South African apartheid to this conflict, it is obscene.  Occupation 101's worst offense is its twisting of the history and facts of the conflict in order to equate the Palestinian cause with celebrated civil rights struggles around the world. Viewers are led to see the situation of the Palestinians as parallel to black South Africans under apartheid or southern blacks during the civil rights era. To pull this off, a decade of unprecedented terrorism directed at Israelis in their homes, cafes, vehicles and religious festivals is made nearly invisible, severing the connection between Israeli measures -- like house demolitions and sweeps through Palestinian villages -- and the Palestinian attacks that precipitated them. This is essential to the film's portrayal of Israeli actions as colonialist aggression rather than as a response to terrorism. The hate indoctrination that permeates Arab society and produces cadres of young Palestinian suicide bombers groomed in hatred, intolerance and rejection of peaceful coexistence is swept under the carpet.",1205193600,35,2087,5.6369426751592355
3093007,5,B0012OTLIA,"The interviews and testimonials were compelling, and more importantly, balanced. This DVD does not bias towards one side over the other.  This is an extremely emotional topic for many people, and the filmmakers and producers did a tremendous job to be objective.  The list of interviewees is impressive, as are their credentials.  You can see why this film took over five years to complete.  After watching the DVD, it will give you a better perspective on how this conflict is portrayed in the US media versus what is actually happening on the ground in the Palestinian territories.  There are heart-wrenching scenes about the human tragedy unfolding to everyday people.  The editing is superb and the 1 1/2 hours went by quickly.  Anyone who regards themselves as fair-minded should watch this DVD.",1200441600,64,800,5.061068702290076

3093009,5,B0012OTLIA,"I was not ignorant of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I have heard personal testimonies from friends, I have studied it in college, I have read on the issue. But after watching this film, to say I really knew much of anything is an overstatement. This film made me want to cry, to vomit, and to be very angry. But it also made me want to ask others to watch it. The atrocities that have been committed, and continue to be committed against the Palestinian people are unspeakable. That these acts have been committed in our (as citizens of the U.S.) name, and extensively funded our government -- are things we should be simultaneously outraged by and ashamed of. I believe everyone needs to watch this film. Bias is not the point nor the intention of this film, its intention is to document the sufferings of an entire group of people. Anyone who watches this should be able to come to their own conclusions. And anyone who watches this, who believes in any sort of human rights, if you do nothing else -- share it with other people. This story needs to be told, and be made visible.",1344816000,22,1085,4.540816326530612

3093012,1,B0012OTLIA,"""Any violence by a large population is not because the people is more violent than any other. It's an alarm, it's a sign, it's a signal that something is wrong in the treatment of this population.""

This blanket excusal of violence introduces Occupation 101, a film designed to evoke sympathy for Palestinians and contempt for Israel,  which is currently being promoted to schools, churches and activist groups. What follows is ninety minutes of indoctrination. Scenes of squalid refugee camps, Israeli soldiers confronting protesters, despairing Palestinian mothers and teary-eyed children serve as a backdrop to well-rehearsed indictments of the Jewish state by a who's who of anti-Israel activists. Narrator Alison Weir and the producer/director team of Sufyan and Abdallah Omeish present a litany of anti-Zionist canards. The message throughout is that Palestinians are blameless victims while Israelis are entirely responsible for Palestinian violence.

Occupation 101's worst offense is its twisting of the history and facts of the conflict in order to equate the Palestinian cause with celebrated civil rights struggles around the world. Viewers are led to see the situation of the Palestinians as parallel to black South Africans under apartheid or southern blacks during the civil rights era. To pull this off, a decade of unprecedented terrorism directed at Israelis in their homes, cafes, vehicles and religious festivals is made nearly invisible, severing the connection between Israeli measures -- like house demolitions and sweeps through Palestinian villages -- and the Palestinian attacks that precipitated them. This is essential to the film's portrayal of Israeli actions as colonialist aggression rather than as a response to terrorism. The hate indoctrination that permeates Arab society and produces cadres of young Palestinian suicide bombers groomed in hatred, intolerance and rejection of peaceful coexistence is swept under the carpet.

A succession of film clips depict oppression in Northern Ireland, in Algeria, against black civil rights marchers in America and South Africa. Words of righteous indignation by Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela are juxtaposed with these scenes of violence. This culminates in footage of Israeli forces assaulting -- without a hint of context -- stone-throwing Palestinian protesters. The viewer is led to see the Palestinian cause as connected to a worldwide struggle for civil rights. But the viewer is being fed a lie, because the concept of equality and coexistence championed by civil rights leaders in South Africa and America is inconsistent with the Palestinian leaders' exhortations to violence.

The actual voices of many Palestinian leaders, as revealed by translations from Palestinian Media Watch and MEMRI (Middle East Media Research Institute), incite hatred and violence. For example:

""Because there are none who love the Jews on the face of the earth: not man, not rock, and not tree everything hates them...Everything wants vengeance on the Jews, on these pigs on the face of the earth,"" (Imam Sheik Ibrahim Madiras on Palestinian TV, Sept. 10, 2004, courtesy of Palestinian Media Watch.)

""We are waging a cruel war with the brothers of monkey and pigs."" (Imam Mohammad Maadi on Palestinian TV, Sept. 12, 2004)

""The Jews are Jews...the Jews are a cancer that spreads inside the body of the Arabic and Islamic nation..."" (Imam Sheik Ibrahim Madiras on Palestinian TV, Jan. 7, 2005)",1324425600,15,3466,5.4533582089552235
3093013,2,B0012OTLIA,"Myth and reality, legend and history; these are the obstacles to understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The title of the documentary, `Occupation 101' is aptly chosen.  The film work is an instruction tool mimicking a basic-level class whose first goal is to overwrite the biased and fatalistic perception of Israel and replace it with reality with the aid of modern footage, biography and current events.

The directors, Sufyan Omeish and Obdallah Omeish engage the viewer in a brief history of the region using frequent interviews with local human rights and peace activists, Israelis and Palestinians.  The interviews tell the story of Israel's occupation of Palestine not merely from today's current `West Bank' and `Gaza' vantage point but that of the whole Zionist movement.  Between the interviews and biographies of Palestinians struggling against occupation are film clips and photos, examples of Israeli brutality against Palestinians, not only from the IDF but from Israeli settlers in the occupied territories.  The images destroy the filtered American media lens and the myth of innocent Israel against the aggressor Arab.

The interviews and subjects are clearly biased.  There was little attempt to get both sides of the story... but it is one side of this very important challenge.

The film's objective continues by correcting numerous other misconceptions about Israel including: ""Jews and Arabs have always been at war"", ""Israel's force is one of continual self -defense"" and the misunderstanding of what it means to be an occupied territory.

Finally, the 2007 film questions current American foreign policies.  The United States has been a huge, and at times, the only prop to Israeli power.  The biased support to unrecognized Zionist agendas paints a warped picture of the conflict.  The film's final push is a call to accountability.  While the film may downplay the violent roles of many Palestinian movements the message implicates Israel as needing to be the responsible player.  Israel's grossly excessive force could be restrained to encourage the peaceful coexistence of Palestine's occupants.",1312588800,11,2126,5.439024390243903
3093014,5,B0012OTLIA,"This is by far the best documentary to detail the history of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. No B/S just facts and testimonies from experts and political activists. Whether you are an expert on the Middle East or just heard about it today, this DVD will paint a very clear picture and show you the other side of the story! The Palestinian side and even through some Israelis' words, which is very rarely seen in the US. I highly recommend this DVD even to the pro Israeli lobby! I dare you to watch it with an open mind and for once ask your self this question; What if the Palestinians weren't the ones who started this whole conflict after all?????",1301702400,9,652,4.533898305084746
3093015,5,B0012OTLIA,"This film is a must-watch for all Americans with a conscience. It is devastatingly eye-opening in its portrayal of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, who are being brutalized by oppression. This may serve as future historical documentation of the sad events unfolding in the Middle East. Our children and their children and so on might some day look to this film for answers to the big question: ""Why are they still fighting?""

3093018,4,B0012OTLIA,"One could quibble about a lot of little things and, yes, as an earlier reviewer wrote, ""It tells the story of the Palestinian side"" rather than pretending to present both sides. But I have studied and written about the conflict and visited Israel and Palestine (West Bank and Gaza) and talked at length with people from just about every perspective, and I would have to say that the film is fundamentally on track. And this should not be surprising: occupation is terrible. As an American (and an American Jew), I can see no justification for our country's totally one-sided support of Israeli policies. Yes, Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians is wrong (and speakers in the film all say that), but (as the film also emphasizes) the core of the problem is occupation. President Obama needs to say that loud and clear. And I'd like to see PBS have the courage to show this documentary followed by a panel presenting arguments for and against.",1245369600,23,952,4.846625766871166

3093022,5,B0012OTLIA,"A very important document. I have learned so much from this documentary. It is amazing of how little do we know about the facts on the ground.

3093025,5,B0012OTLIA,"Longer than I would have liked, Occupation 101 tells the day-to-day story of regular Palestinians, Christian and Muslim, in the Occupied Territories in a thorough if ""hard to watch"" manner.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is searching for more information than what has been the 60 years of media coverage in the USA supporting only the ""official"" Zionist view of the state of affairs in Israel-Palestine.

We all pray for peace in the Middle East, but we forget that a prerequisite to peace anywhere is JUSTICE!  This not anti-Israel, or anti-Jewish, it just seeks the middle ground of understanding another side of the whole picture.",1234051200,11,642,4.981308411214953
3093026,5,B0012OTLIA,"I have been involved with enlightening others about the truth of life in Palestine for years now. I kept watching this documentary with a critical eye and by the end of it I thought to myself, ""Well, this is very biased. Perhaps a little more about the plight of Israelis and it would have been just right."" I sat down to write this review with every intention of giving the documentary 3 stars. And then I took a minute to think about it and realized what a cynic I have become. If suffering was something that could be measured by physical means, the truth is that Palestinians would top the charts compared to Israelis. This documentary wastes no time in attempting to balance itself and, even though it seems biased because the statistics are so bizarre, sets out instead to tell the truth.

3093027,5,B0012OTLIA,"This film is long overdue and should be a mandatory item in schools. It dispels the propaganda campaign that the pro-Israeli lobby has been so successful in creating since its military conquering of Palestine in 1947-1948. There is a great myth about how Palestine was an empty land before the recent flood of Jewish immigrants flocked to its shores. So how does one explain the 750,000 Palestinians forced to flee for their lives when the Jewish militias started destroying Palestinian villages?

Let the world hear the truth for once without all the filters of the Jewish-Israeli Lobby, then judge for them selves as to the who the real war criminals are. Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela have themselves said the Palestinians face a situation far worse than the black South Africans did under the racist white Apartheid system. Also, read Israeli historian, Illan Pappe's account in his latest book ""The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine"" if you wish to know the facts of the creation of Israel and the simultaneous destruction of Palestine. Please see this film and read Illan Pappe' book...",1212624000,48,1090,5.0220994475138125

And this should not be surprising: occupation is terrible. As an American (and an American Jew), I can see no justification for our country's totally one-sided support of Israeli policies. Yes, Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians is wrong (and speakers in the film all say that), but (as the film also emphasizes) the core of the problem is occupation. President Obama needs to say that loud and clear. And I'd like to see PBS have the courage to show this documentary followed by a panel presenting arguments for and against.",1245369600,23,952,4.846625766871166

I kept watching this documentary with a critical eye and by the end of it I thought to myself, ""Well, this is very biased. Perhaps a little more about the plight of Israelis and it would have been just right."" I sat down to write this review with every intention of giving the documentary 3 stars. And then I took a minute to think about it and realized what a cynic I have become. If suffering was something that could be measured by physical means, the truth is that Palestinians would top the charts compared to Israelis. This documentary wastes no time in attempting to balance itself and, even though it seems biased because the statistics are so bizarre, sets out instead to tell the truth.

3327524,5,B0012OTLIA,"This film is long overdue and should be a mandatory item in schools. It dispels the propaganda campaign that the pro-Israeli lobby has been so successful in creating since its military conquering of Palestine in 1947-1948. There is a great myth about how Palestine was an empty land before the recent flood of Jewish immigrants flocked to its shores. So how does one explain the 750,000 Palestinians forced to flee for their lives when the Jewish militias started destroying Palestinian villages?

Let the world hear the truth for once without all the filters of the Jewish-Israeli Lobby, then judge for them selves as to the who the real war criminals are. Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela have themselves said the Palestinians face a situation far worse than the black South Africans did under the racist white Apartheid system.

Imagine the U.S. government deciding to bulldoze your home because a wealthy person a member of the 1% club wanted to live there, well this is what is happening in Gaza the Israeli government is bulldozing Palestinian homes so as to make room for Jewish settlements. Also the Israeli military are daily terrorizing the people of Gaza, the real terrorists in the middle east is the Israeli military, the one aspect of this terrorism that sickens me to my stomach is that the American tax payers like myself are financially supporting Israel, from 1949-1996 Israel received 62.5 BILLION DOLLARS in aid from the U.S. tax payers, every politician in Washington D.C. is afraid to criticize Israel that includes present day President Obama, I dedicate this review to the courageous young American lady RACHEL CORRIE who at the age of 23 was murderously run over by a bulldozer in Gaza, watch this documentary DVD and see this for yourself.",1425600000,,1362,4.926086956521739

8247097,1,B0012OTLIA,"If you need a definition of the word agitprop, this film is it.  It is about a one sided as you could get, and while many of the facts presented in it are undoubtedly true, and living under occupation is very difficult, the reasons why there is an occupation in the first place is never mentioned.  Terrorism by Palestinians is mentioned for about 15 seconds in the entire film, and the fact that for many Palestinians and certainly anyone connected to Hamas, the very existence is Israel is an occupation, and therefore all the Jews should be driven out of it.  The '67 war is mentioned as something that just happened, and not as an attempt by Arabs from several countries and the Palestinians to eliminate Israel.  The occupation of lands surrounding Israel was a direct outgrowth of this as a way to increase it's security.  The attacks on Gaza following Israel's leaving it are presented only as something Israel does to intimidate Palestinians, and there isn't one mention of the fact that Hamas uses Gaza as a base for daily rocket fire into Israel, and Gaza only gets attacked when the rocket shelling reaches a point that they must respond.  If Gaza does not want to be attacked, they simply have to acknowledge that Israel has a right to exist and cease rocket attacks.  The film complains that there is a dividing wall built and people in Gaza are under constant watch from Israel.  What else should they expect when they are constantly firing rockets into Israel.  The things they complain about are normal reactions to what they do on a daily basis.  If these things were eliminated, Hamas with a goal of destroying Israel, or at least killing as many Israelis as they can would simply increase attacks.  The film complains that Palestinians used to work Israel in large numbers and now can't get in.  Since they virtually ignore the large number of Israelis killed by suicide bombers whose only goal was to kill as many civilians as possible when there were not the restrictions, it makes their arguments very weak.

I can agree with the film that I think Israel is making a mistake by continuing settlement construction on the West Bank.  Personally I would like to see this end and many of the restrictions and freedom of movement.  I think Israel has gone far beyond security concerns in their approach to the West Bank.  The fact that for many settlers this is some kind of religious obligation makes it worse, and really not justified.  But again the context of having neighbors who won't acknowledge your right to exist and are likely to use any lessening of restrictions as an excuse to attempt attacks gives some justification to Israel's actions.  The Palestinians have to accept the fact that Israel is there and will be there, and focus their attention on building their own country not destroying another.  I am quite sure a large proportion of Gaza's resources are directed to their attacks on Israel.  If these were put toward building Gaza not attacking Israel, the lives of the people that the film probably accurately shows as desperate would be greatly improved, and they would not have to fear getting bombed by Israel in retaliation.

So while there is a lot of truth in the film, when it is presented with only half the information, their credibility is reduced pretty much to zero.  It was amusing that in the film they attacked the American press for not presenting all the truth about what goes on in the occupied territories.  While I don't think this is accurate, as there have been reports not unlike the film especially around conflicts, the fact that the filmmakers clearly are guilty of doing just that with about as one sided a presentation as you could ever imagine.  It makes the whole thing pretty much a worthless piece of propaganda.",1391990400,4,3783,4.7317073170731705
