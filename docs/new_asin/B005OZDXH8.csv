8482209,5,B005OZDXH8,"Anibal Dos Santos is a fantastic viola player and interpreter. This instrument is so difficult to stay in tune with. The warm sound, the flying fingers, the music ... almost everything.
The ""almost"" is the tango itself, as a dance. Not necessary.
Amazon has find for me a CD you cannot find in Europe.

8482210,4,B005OZDXH8,"This DVD concert is truly international in scope. And it mixes musical styles from symphonic to Spanish to rock. Though it was commissioned and premiered in 2003, the ""Viola Tango Rock Concerto"" by Russian born composer Benjamin Yusupov was not recorded until this 2008 concert in Bogot Colombia, by the Bogot Philharmonic Orchestra. The principal soloist is Venezuelan- born, but American-trained viola player Anibal Dos Santos, who not only plays the acoustic and electric violas, but - in the last segment of the piece, dances an exciting tango with choreographer Gina Medina!

I'm not quite sure how many movements the 50-minute composition has, because, even though the DVD includes a colorful 12-page booklet of essays on the composer and Dos Santos, there is - surprisingly - no listing of the movements and their titles. Using the ""chapter stops"" as counters, there appear to be six moments, so I'll refer to those in my comments.

The first movement is mostly slow and sounds like most symphonic pieces. The viola duels occasionally with a Spanish guitar. At this point you see an accordion player but he is silent (at least for now). The 2nd movement continues as the first with the string sections doing more plucking than bowing.

At the 20-minute mark (3rd movement?) the drum set, electric guitar and electric bass kick in and the stage lights begin to flash. Dos Santos switches to the electric viola and we hear a bit of Celtic Rock and then funk. This section lasts about five minutes and then it's back to the acoustic viola and Spanish guitar, this time alternating solos rather than dueling and NOW the accordion enters the music score. For the fifth movement the accordion is out front with a Spanish tinge (a la Astor Piazzola) with bongos and the reed section adding support. The viola is absent in this movement. The concluding 6th movement has Dos Santos performing the aforementioned tango to end the performance to a standing ovation.

Like many releases from the New Hampshire-based Navona label, this is ""new music"" which crosses genres. Those seeking a ""rock"" composition - as promoted on the cover - may find parts a bit slow, while those who expect either tango or traditional classical strains may be shocked at the aggressive third movement. But those with an open mind - and a broad musical spectrum - will find an ""adventure in music"" on this DVD and the camera work and sound quality will keep your attention.
