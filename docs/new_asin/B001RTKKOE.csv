8338796,5,B001RTKKOE,"I teach engineering at the secondary level.  It is tough to find substitutes that know how to run CAD software or shop machinery so what do you do if you have to be out of the classroom?  These video's take up a full period and it doesn't take a lot of time to put together some worksheets that substitutes can use in a pinch.  The kids don't complain either, these videos are actually pretty interesting.",1393113600,4,405,4.373333333333333
8338797,4,B001RTKKOE,To see how some thing is made from the idea to Blue print to being built is always interesting to see from start to finish.,1383955200,,123,3.96
8338798,5,B001RTKKOE,"This was a very interesting dvd about very large engineering projects. Bridges building, etc. Excellant service and on time. Recommended highly.",1374192000,,144,5.904761904761905
8338799,5,B001RTKKOE,This is amazing and hours of enjoyment!!!! I bought the 5 disc set that had 10 shows 2 on each DVD. And I was thrilled. But then I found this one with 8 shows. Four that I already had plus 4 more!!  Then I also purchased collection one that also had 4 that were not on the original 5 DVD collection. Still with this one and collection one. It gives you even more great shows.  Bought the original 5 disc for my husband the other two for my son.  Wish I would have gotten collection one and two for my husband as well bc these have 8 on each collection totaling 16!!!!!!  What a super deal!!,1372723200,,590,4.060344827586207
8338800,4,B001RTKKOE,"Thanks, It was Good but not quite as good as the first season. I was expecting more episodes and real projects not make believe underwater bullet trains that would have to travel a few thousand miles per hour inside a vacuum tube.  The bridge episode was extremely cool and the method of testing the design was real world engineering practice.",1368316800,,343,4.716666666666667
