6751347,5,B00OHLR8F8,"Well This is god finally saying we should get 5ds and honestly i loved this series with the bottom of my heart and what confuses me is that there are 8 disks to this but holds 1000 minutes while Season 1 of the original yugioh has 1015 minutes within 49 episodes meaning 21 minutes per episode dubbed

If the math and logic is done correctly then this will be the first official series to recieve a localized sub but so far unconfirmed with what little data i have, if it isn't subbed than i would have to give it 4 stars",1418515200,2,521,4.158415841584159

6751349,2,B00OHLR8F8,"The original season will always be the best but after GX which was pretty good, the series got worse. 5DS was a little overrated but glad all the series are getting their seasons up for all their fans.",1416614400,2,201,4.315789473684211
6751350,5,B00OHLR8F8,Finally Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D in English and the whole first season and It's going to be released almost a week after my birthday. The 5Ds series to me is the best and 1 hope the episodes that didn't come in English will come dubbed as well.,1414540800,10,232,4.177777777777778

6751359,5,B00OHLR8F8,"I was inspired by watching the movie  Yugioh Bonds Beyond Time to start watching Yugioh 5d's again. This DVD set is incredible! I love watching Yusei and watching battle Jack and then The Dark Signers!  This is a must have for any Yugioh fan! Also btw for anyone complaining about the this being solely dubbed, this is how I originally watched Yugioh 5d's, and yes while some of the dub isn't the best, I wouldn't have it or watch Yugioh 5d's any other way.",1446336000,,457,4.428571428571429

6751375,1,B00OHLR8F8,"Yu-gi-oh 5Ds was the best that the yu-gi-oh anime had to offer, sadly it became one of if not the worst 4K dubs. This dvd only contains the dub version and not the uncut japanese subbed version. If you want to watch a good yugioh show go onto crunchyroll, hulu or yugioh's website and watch it subbed!",1431993600,,301,4.298245614035087

6751377,5,B00OHLR8F8,"The best season of Yu-Gi-Oh! ever, excluding the ""ARC V"" season currently in Japan. I had a lot of fun watching my favorite duels in English dub again after so many years.

6751381,5,B00OHLR8F8,"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5DS is my most favorite of all the Yu-Gi-Oh! series. Even though this box set is titled Yu-Gi-Oh! 5DS Season 1 with all 64 episodes, it is actually Seasons 1 and 2 together. Other than that, the graphics and episodes are completely perfect. I am very curious to see what the next box set is going to be titled.",1425254400,4,320,4.35

6751383,5,B00OHLR8F8,"I think that the last time I watched an episode from Yugioh 5D's was about 6 or 7 years ago. I didn't think that the complete first season would have 64 episodes, so that was a nice surprise & it was fun to watch all of those Turbo Duels again.",1424822400,4,244,3.9
6751384,4,B00OHLR8F8,"64 episodes for this price is a great bargin, the dub can be abit irritating at times unlike the previous seasons, but it's still a good watch for anyone who's a fan of 5d's or the Yugioh anime.",1423094400,,194,4.131578947368421

6751390,5,B00OHLR8F8,"I have loved this series in the past and was excited to have the opportunity to watch this before it hit the market. The DVD set has everything for the true Yu-Gi-Oh fan. On this DVD you are getting a great mix of episodes from this season. There were so many episodes that I had yet to see when I was watching this. I was excited to be able rekindle my love for the original series because it had been a long time since I have seen episodes from this series. The art in this series is great and the writing is strong. In my opinion this has to be one of the best series' in the Yu-Gi-Oh line!
