8411694,5,B00402FGGM,"Two of the three movies are great and the third is very good--Hoosiers is, in the words of one of my friends, ""flawless.""  And Pride of the Yankees is very underrated; it's fascinating to see Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel play themselves, and Cooper is a class act as Gehrig.  I guess all three movies were made by MGM (probably under the management of my grandfather's uncle for at least Pride of the Yankees, as he was President of the studio), which explains why movies so disparate are part of the same package.",1383350400,2,510,4.473118279569892
