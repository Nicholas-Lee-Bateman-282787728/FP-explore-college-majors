2534707,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Warning:  Spoilers ahead!

Season Three was in many ways a dramatic departure from the previous two season for THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK.  The romantic will they/won't they of the first two seasons gave way to:  will they be able to?  Season Two had ended with Lois about to reply to Clark's proposal of marriage, her words being interrupted by the ""to be continued"" message.  Season Three picked up the last few minutes of Season Two, only this time we get her answer in the form of a question:  ""Who's asking?  Is it Clark or Superman?"" removing his glasses to show that she knows his secret.  Thus, Season Three begins with a radically premise from the first two seasons.  Instead of dancing around how they feel, each acknowledges their love for one another, Lois knows Clark's secret, and they both try to answer the question of whether Superman can marry.  Some fans preferred the tease of the first two seasons to the full-blown engagement of Season Three, but I personally always love when a show tries to move forward and do something different.

Season Three also saw some improvement in the primary weakness of the first two seasons:  the strength of the villains.  While LOIS AND CLARK was always delightful for the wonderful chemistry between Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain in the lead roles (whether the many rumors of their off-screen antagonism was true or not), the show sometimes lagged from rather lame villains and single-episode storylines that seemed to have been produced with little effort.  If one contrasted what was happening on a contemporary show, THE X-FILES, which was producing single episodes of near-cinematic quality, the problem is highlighted.  Shooting almost exclusively on the Warner Brothers lot hurts as well (fans of THE GILMORE GIRLS will recognize much of Stars Hollow in Metropolis).  Still, in Season Three there was a sharp increase in the quality of the individual episodes.  The villains were truly menacing and there were genuine moments of tension.  Also, Lois's knowledge of Clark's secret identity added many delightful new wrinkles to the show, and she quickly proved herself to be far more adept at covering for Clark's sudden departures than Clark had ever been in the past.

Season Three is also remarkable for some significant changes in the way the show approaches story arcs and narrative.  THE X-FILES, following in the wake of TWIN PEAKS, had begun to popularize story arcs that extended beyond a single episode.  Though the technique had been developed by HILL STREET BLUES in the eighties, in the nineties it was extended to Sci-fi and fantasy genres as well, and expanded so that on shows like THE X-FILES arcs could extend for several years.  LOIS AND CLARK had only one real story arc, the potential for romance between Lois and Clark, while all the other arcs were with minor exceptions contained within single episodes.  In Season Three the engagement took over as the main arc, with Clark and Lois struggling to resolve the main issues connected with his being Superman.  But in addition to this, towards the end of the season they began stretching the narrative over one episode to another.  Only occasionally in the first two seasons had they done this, but beginning with the episode where villains are able to clone humans using enzymes found in frogs until the end of the season, we see nothing but episodes that flow from one into another.  This represented a major change in narrative strategy on the show.  Traditionally networks do not like shows that do this.  The assumption is that you might lose potential viewers who are distraught at being behind the curve on what is happening on the show.  Such shows try to catch these viewers up with the ""Previously on . . . "" at the beginning, but networks generally prefer shows that depend entirely on stand alone episodes.  Even if a viewer misses a few episodes, they can easily jump back into the middle of things.  So, it was a very important change on LOIS AND CLARK when they jumped on the ongoing story arc bandwagon in the final third of the season.

I really enjoyed Season Three, not least because they took a highly unusual step, one followed by few other shows with romantic tension between the main characters.  The received wisdom is that you can't have a successful show where a natural romantic couple actually gets together.  For instance, the ratings collapse for MOONLIGHTING after Maddie and David got together is taken as a warning to all other shows.  So, Maggie and Joel mainly are not together on NORTHERN EXPOSURE, and as soon as Buffy and Angel get together they are torn apart, and JD and Elliott on SCRUBS get together only to fall apart immediately.  Clark and Lois are prevented from marrying, but with a couple of minor qualifications, they are essentially a committed couple for the entire season.  Again, their ratings began to fade after they became a steady couple, so perhaps this could be viewed as reinforcement of the MOONLIGHTING lesson.  But personally, I love seeing a couple stay together on TV.  Maybe I'm not wired like others, but I enjoy seeing a couple be together as much as I like seeing them get together.  I think that LOIS AND CLARK's ratings decline can actually be blamed on other factors, such as some unfortunate decisions about where to take story arcs.  I do think that by getting Clark and Lois together, the show did create a problem for itself.  Once you have resolved the central dilemma of the show, which was whether Lois and Clark will get together, you have to find a new source of dramatic tension.  I don't think the show did a good show of doing this, and that is the main reason that the show began to slip a bit in Season Four.

One other general comment.  Season Three was the first season to really start showing the effects of the growing capabilities of CGI.  It wasn't utilized extensively, but it made Clark or Superman's quick getaways far more believable.  Although SMALLVILLE came around only three years after the end of LOIS AND CLARK, you can see there how good CGI got only a few years later.  Nonetheless, it did really enhance the believability of the show in the final two seasons.

In summary, this was another really great season in one of the most innovative romantic comedies that we have seen in the past couple of decades.  It is also a season in which the show began to branch out in new directions.  Lois and Clark don't yet get to live happily ever after, but at least they were clear in their own minds what they wanted to do.",1141948800,86,6554,4.749778956675509

2534786,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Loved the TV series. Love the DVDs of Season 3 of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.

I have been a ""fan"" of Superman since I was first introduced to the Super Hero character as a very young boy. My first memory of Superman goes back to age 5 when I first watch a Superman cartoon one Saturday morning on TV. I was hooked. Still enjoy the Superman Story.

I now have the first three seasons of this well done, wonderful TV series. I will be buying additional seasons of this TV series.

Developed for television by Deborah Joy LeVine. The series loosely followed the modern origin of Superman, established by writer John Byrnewhere Clark Kent is the true personality and Superman a disguise. As the show's title suggests, the series focused on the relationship and romance between Clark and Lois, as much as the adventures of Clark's alter-ego, Superman.

On May 17, 1966, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Eddie Jones and K Callan) witness the crash-landing of a small spaceship in Shuster's Field outside of Smallville, Kansas. When they investigate, they discover the baby Kal-El, decide to raise him as their own, and name him ""Clark Jerome Kent"". Throughout the series, Clark proudly states his mother made his Superman costume for him. Clark often consults Jonathan and Martha, either by telephone or in person after impromptu Superman flights to Smallville, about personal and moral concerns and dilemmas.

The series opens twenty-seven years later, on the day Clark moves to Metropolis and interviews for a job at the Daily Planet under editor Perry White (Lane Smith). Clark becomes acquainted with photographer Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes in Season One, Justin Whalin thereafter) and gossip columnist Cat Grant (Tracy Scoggins). Soon after being hired, Clark is partnered with star reporter Lois Lane. Within minutes of Clark getting a job, he and Lois are given an assignment together. Clark falls in love with Lois at first sight, but she considers him to be little more than a rookie slowing her down. When Superman saves her from a space shuttle disaster, Lois instantly becomes infatuated with Clark's alter-ego.

Lois & Clark was the second effort to break tradition and mirror John Byrne's retcon of Superman, which included making Clark Kent more assertive and less clumsy. Dean Cain's Clark gradually becomes a well-regarded and highly competent reporter, even beating out Lois for a Kerth award (much to her consternation). A few episodes directly emphasized that Clark was the unequivocal ""dominant"" personality, not Superman. Following this theme, an innovation unique to the series was the depiction of Clark Kent and Superman's traditional hairstyles being reversed  here it is Superman whose hair is slicked-back, and Clark whose fringe falls more naturally.

An additional element that reflected the post-Byrne comics was the portrayal of Lex Luthor (at least initially) as a corrupt corporate tycoon, rather than the more traditional mad scientist.

In this series, with the exception of Lois, Clark's parents, Wayne Irig, H.G. Wells, and four villains (Mister Mxyzptlk, Diana Stride, Jason Mazik and Tempus), everyone who has found out Superman's true identity has either been killed or had his/her memory erased. A subplot that was never truly resolved before the series ended dealt with the shadowy government agency, Bureau 39, which possessed the spacecraft which brought Superman to Earth as an infant, and may have connections with Intergang.

In November 2013, Superman fans named Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain as the best Lois and Clark combination ever covering both TV and Superman films. They are right on the mark.

Buy and watch this season (and other seasons) of this wonderful TV series.",1433116800,,3730,5.128500823723229

2534788,5,B000EU1Q2W,Loved it then. Still love it now!,1431648000,,33,3.857142857142857
2534789,4,B000EU1Q2W,"Season 3 of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman continues to very human take on the comic book characters.  It also heats up the romance even more, if that is possible.  Unfortunately, it does get uneven in the final third, but overall it is still a strong season.

It starts exactly where season 2 ended.  Clark Kent (Dean Cain) has just asked Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) to marry him.  The response is the last thing he expected, ""Who's asking, you or Superman?""  Yes, Lois has figured out Clark's dual identity as Superman.  They actually have some fun with that over the course of the season as Lois begins to help come up with excuses for why Clark has to duck out for every emergency.

Of course, there are the usual villains around town.  Intergang tries to make a resurgence in the criminal element.  A mad man is trying to prepare for the next flood.  A woman claims that her super powered son is Superman's love child.  Lois winds up with Superman's powers while Superman is ordinary.  And one of Lois' classmates tries her best to get the popular kids to notice her now.

But with all the secrets finally out in the open, and romance between Clark Kent and Lois Lane really takes off.  After a few pumps, they start to plan the big day with all the usual complications - cold feet, an overbearing mother of the bride (recast and now played by guest star Beverly Garland), bad weather making travel the day of the big event hard, clones....

Clones?  Yes, this season introduces the now infamous storyline as a way to keep the couple from getting married.  I remember hearing about it at the time and all the people who were upset by the turn of events.  I thought maybe I would be okay since I knew it was coming.  And I'll admit the first few episodes of this 5 episode arc were fine.  But as it progressed, it just got more and more ludicrous.  It felt like something from a soap opera.  I was thrilled when it was over and we could get back to the true heart of the show.

And if you wondered what that was, this season ends all speculation.  There is a reason they called the show Lois and Clark.  When they actually do start talking about how important they are to each other late in the season, it doesn't come across as forced or dishonest.  I can't help but believe it.  The writers continue to do a great job of humanizing the characters, even Superman.  And the actors run with the great material.  I have a hard time picturing anyone other than Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain in these roles as written here (or anywhere else, but that's another issue).

The supporting cast is great as always, too.  Lane Smith still has fun as Perry White, although I'm not a fan of the storyline they give him this season.  Justin Whalin continues to make a great Jimmy Olsen.  It's not a big part, but he continues to make the character interesting.  They don't use Eddie Jones and K Callan as Jonathan and Martha Kent in every episode, but they are always used to great effect.  Those chats with his parents are what make Clark and Superman seem so human to me.

The final two episodes of the season dig the most into Superman's Kryptonite heritage of anything they've done so far.  If you love these characters, be prepared to be emotionally moved even if the writing isn't the best here.  That's how good the performances are.

Season 3 consisted of the standard 22 episodes, and they are all here on six discs.  The picture is full frame and the sound is stereo.  No, this isn't going to look or sound impressive on your modern entertainment set, but it still looks good for the original source material.  This set was released not too long before Superman Returns came out, and you can tell with the extras.  There is a six minute teaser from the Superman documentary Look, Up in the Sky! that somehow manages to plug that new movie several times.  Lois and Clark: A History of Romance focuses on the romance between this pair in all their various incarnations.  Finally, there's a fairly easy trivia challenge that again plugs the movie a couple of times.  None of these extras are very long and only moderately interesting.

Other than that one story arc, I really enjoyed the third season of Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.  If you like your superheroes human (as everyone seems to given the current superhero movies), you absolutely need to check out this series.",1430870400,,4400,4.508860759493671
2534790,4,B000EU1Q2W,"I like this series the best so far from what I've been watching. Last season seemed to be mainly about Lois being frustrated with Clark for always running off every time she had something important to say to him. This season, Lois found out and now their relationship is steadily progressing. not a big fan of how the writers prevented Lois and Clark from being married for real, though.

 I had to knock off one star, because I'm also not a big fan of the DVD case's packaging. basically, on the inside of the DVD case you have all those dvds stacked up on each other in a pile.... so it's very difficult to access the dvds you want. So if you wanted to watch the last dvd but all the other dvds are stacked on it? then too bad, you have to keep on removing the dvds one by one from the stack which is held in place by this tall button thing that you have to press down on while carefully removing the dvds.

However, the discs are setup in a stack, one on top of the other. ALL my discs arrived damaged because of how they were are placed in the case.

2534835,4,B000EU1Q2W,"I've been a Superman fan since the '50s, and I love most things related to DC Comics. Lois & Clark got off to a great start, and the first season was good, but it never held the wonder that the comics did. The problem was that where the comics took the time to explore the lives of all the characters, Lois & Clark limited its focus to, well, Lois & Clark. The show was good, and I liked it, and I own all four seasons, but I never quite managed to love it. I think my problems was that it was too lightweight in tone. Sure it should be fun, but to me they never seemed to take it quite seriously enough.

Smallville and the newer Arrow are just the opposite. I don't like what they've done with the characters and the overall storyline, but they've done such a good job that they forced me to watch. Lois & Clark was more faithful to the original plotlines, but they didn't do such a good job. Still, it's Superman and I do like it. I just don't love it.",1394755200,,955,4.079787234042553

2534851,4,B000EU1Q2W,"All TV shows hit the point where they lose steam.  I think that started to happen in season 3 of Lois and Clark, mainly because of sticking with the villain of the week format that was established in Season 2.  The reason it worked so well in that season is they had good villains and story lines.  In season 3 they started running out of ideas for good villains and as a result a lot of the stories were very silly.

That is not to say that all the episodes were bad.  The mid season arc which brought John Shea back as Lex Luthor for a couple episodes were very good (and showed off Teri Hatcher's acting chops, especially the comedic ones), and the return of Tempus and H.G. Wells made for a very good episode.  But many of the episodes surrounding those, which were mainly used to bring tension to the relationship and keep them from really getting together were not nearly as good as the first and second season episodes.  The show did get its footing back with the season ending arc that introduced the Kryptonian survivors and ended the season on a cliff hanger.

As far as the A/V quality and extras go, they are pretty much on par with the other season releases.  For bonus material there is a short feature on the Lois and Clark relationship from over the course of the Superman comics, movies and TV shows.  There is also a 10 min trivia game hosted by Dan Cain (sporting a rather hilarious hair style) where he asks and answers questions about the Superman mythology.

In all, Season 3 was not as good as the prior two, but still had its good points.  If you are a fan of the show, it is still worth getting, but you will probably roll your eyes at some of the story lines.",1378598400,2,1685,4.314285714285714

2534881,1,B000EU1Q2W,"Season three is really where the final nail in their coffin was hammered in, it opens up literally right where season 2 left off. Annd Lois gives Clark a maybe, and so for the next 4 episodes. They're mad at each other, she's mad at him for not telling her he's Superman. he's mad at her for being mad at him, then he breaks up with her because he's forced to choose her or the city, and he almost loses her. But wait, He made a mistake and wants her back. Then they finally get back together, only to have Clark's powers transfered to Lois, when Shelley Long Zaps him with Red Kryptonite. In an otherwise boring episode, only to have Lois see life as a superhero. As Ultrawoman, we get another Tempus Episode. Only it's an alternate universe, which is really cool. Then finally a wedding, and here is where season 3 really just can't get out of it's own way. Clark didn't marry the real Lois, he married a clone. Sent by none other than Lex Luthor, now that alone should have made for a great 2 or 3 part episode. Nope, not Lois And Clark. Let's throw in amnesia, Lois doesn't who she is. Lex tries to use this to his advantage. But he loses, and in a touching moment, the clone that married Clark. Ends up falling in love with him, she sacrafices herself to save his life. But in the end, Lois still doesn't have her memory. So after Luthor dies, Lois is checked into a clinic, only her doctor falls in love with her. I'm now on the 4th episode of this storyline, But wait. A maniac is out there with a mind altering machine, that in the end restores Lois's Memory. And that is the 5th episode of that story line, It was drawn out waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. But wait, we're all of a sudden going to throw in Kryptonians. Since there's a civil war going on on New Krypton, and Kal-El is all of a sudden Nobility on Krypton. That never made since to me, this whole season is a convoluted mess. They couldn't get out of their own way, again there were alot of Characters that added nothing to the show. I would give it 0 stars if I could.",1347408000,,2037,4.239074550128534

2534884,4,B000EU1Q2W,"If you are following the series on DVD, then of course this season must be included. (I am going on the assumption that you have already seen the entire series so any ""spoilers"" mentioned here will not upset you.)

To recap:
 At the end of Season Two Clark asked Lois to marry him, and in the very first scene of S3 Lois asks who is asking - Clark or Superman?

 She says no; later she says yes. They plan the wedding; they have the wedding; but Lois is a frog-eating clone; Lois loses her memory; Lex is resurrected; Wanda Detroit (Lois) falls for Lex, then Lex is gone again; Lois regains most of here memory but falls in love with her unscrupulous therapist.

 Things are finally straightened out, but just when they are talking wedding/elopement, the season ends when two surviving (of a thousand) Kryptonians telling Kal-el that he was married at birth to Zara and he MUST go to the rocky red-sunned (no super powers) planet to run the place or civil war will break out.

 Most of the episodes are pretty good, but the ""will they? won't they?"" gets a bit tedious sometimes. Makes you want to shout at the TV, ""Just let them get married for crying out loud!"" But that is reserved for Season Four.

Obviously there are stand-alone episodes that have nothing to do with their non-marital problems. And there are some pretty colorful bad guys to contend with.

The other characters (Martha, Jonathan, Perry, and Jimmy) are just as entertaining as in seasons one and two (a new Jimmy Olsen came on board in S2, but he's still pretty good).

Was it a perfect season? No.
Is it entertaining? Mostly.
Should you buy this third season DVD set? Definitely, if you are following ""The New Adventures of Superman.""

The villians trying to do away with L&C threaten them with real harm, but the foibles of the villians are exaggerated to let the viewer know that Lois and the Man of Steel will prevail in the end.

2534890,3,B000EU1Q2W,"I really did love this show on its first run.  When I was a kid, I loved all things Superman, and this show was really all that was knew at the time, as all things superheroes was to be avoided like the plague (Here's looking at you Batman and Robin) and this show was definitely corny and tongue in cheek, but at its best, it was more about a love story, and if you looked at it just the right way in its first two seasons, it was drama about the archetypes of what strong leaders in society effect in a lot of our changing cultural norms of feminism and corporate greed, but without taking itself too seriously.  I loved the Lex Luther that they had on this show, which is absent from this season with the exception of one story arc.  The tension of will they won't they get together really does start to run dry, and the them together, Lois knowing his secret plot line is a bit heavy handed, and it relies too heavily on the camp that most people remember the show for.  Overall my least favorite season, and also you can really start to see that Teri Hatcher had stardom start going to her head this season.  If you are going to make it to season four, which is a better season, you are going to need to watch this, but don't expect either of those seasons to recapture all the magic of the first two.  Look forward to some cringe worth moments like Clark talking about being a Virgin and Lois trying to defend her sexuality in a VR world.  Or really weird Nazi episodes, or a bizarre stance against the second amendment, as liberals explore their worse nightmare of an armed America.  I also have to throw out there that there is a lot of leftist political satirizing that is so corny and hokey that they don't manage to make a legible point and come off as drastically dense when making their points, even on the ones I agreed with.

Love has never been closer...or further away. But that's what makes this series so great: facilitating events for our favourite couple, and then pulling out the rug from under us. For the most part, the episodes are stand-alone until ""I Now Pronounce You..."" which is one of the most romantic in the series, and has one of the most shocking endings ever. Dean Cain once again contributes to the fun with ""Virtually Destroyed,"" and Teri Hatcher gets in on the action with ""It's A Small World After All."" The out of this world shenanigans continue with ""Don't Tug On Superman's Cape."" The only episode I didn't really like is ""Tempus, Anyone?""

The passion intensifies between Clark and Lois as their relationship progresses with every new disaster that they get into; which is the driving force of the show.
Now, why did I give this 4 stars instead of five? Well, while I really enjoy the show, there were some episodes that left much to be desired. The bulk of the season had great stories, however, there were some that just missed the mark. Further, some episodes seemed rehashed.

Note: the episodes that missed the mark were just about three, so like I said, this season is great just not 5 star great. :)

And I am surprised and pleased at the tribute to healthy values such as waiting, and not compromising with truth. On the other hand, the powers that be aren't above putting Teri in some skimpy and tight outfits.
The recurring theme of season three is the continued struggle to have a normal relationship. Sometimes it seems that the supervillians are more set on destroying Lois and Clark's relationship than they are on stopping Superman.
The series as a whole is definitely a different take on the old comic book story, but in a completely different way than Smallville. L&C is certainly more tongue in cheek, and fun.",1203811200,,765,4.632352941176471

The writing and the action of the story have definitely hit the peak with this season. Needless to say, I recommend this to everyone that loved the previous seasons.

2534909,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Lois & Clark came along way for married duo for a long time.  They're relationship, in real life a lot of people would give anything what Lois & Clark have in real life. They had a lot a ups and downs it was worth it to get them together.  Out of all the t.v. shows of Superman shows I seen, no one could do what these could do.

I never have to worry about Dean Cain being typecast as Superman or the Superman curse.  He's doing just fine, the difference between George Reeves as Superman and Dean Cain Superman is George Reeves's Superman is a like a Saturday Morning Cartoon show.  Have the time when he plays Clark Kent, Jack Larson plays Jimmy Olsen and Noelle Carter plays Lois Lane. They're like playing Ward, Beaver and June Cleaver in Leave it to Beaver.  George Reeves and Jimmy Olsen were like father and son, than friends.  Dean Cain is playing Superman, he was like a teenager than can't grow up and I saw another side Clark Kent I never seen before.  He has feelings, problems and he was scared all the time.

When he was Superman, that he was just like a regular person like everybody else, the show was revolve around Clark Kent than Superman.  Dean Cain love playing Clark Kent than Superman, Superman is kind of symbol for good and hope, has to follow truth, justice and the american way.  Even though I hated that slogan truth, justice and the american way, they're just words but to me Superman is guy a like to help.  Clark Kent has feelings, problems, trips, nerdy, sarcastic, he can say anything he want more than Superman than does and perverted like me.  That's the reason, how I admired Clark Kent in the first place.  When I was watching Smallville, the relationship of Lois and Lana are kind of the like the same relationship as Lois and Clark.  The same was, Lois was trying to get close to Clark, he always leave when theirs danger when they were talking about something important. A lot of times Clark always wanted to tell Lois who he was, never had a chance to.  But he did and they're still together.  That's the same relationship with him and Lana had in Smallville, but the difference is when Lana found she was a target and nearly got killed by Lex.  When Clark went back in time and didn't tell her.  That's the reason, why he never tells anybody who he is somebody could be a target or trust.  When Teri Hatcher was playing Lois Lane, in a couple episodes she was Clark's Rival, to best friend and girlfriend. Lois Lane was compared to in Smallvlle, as Lana Lanh and Chloe Sullivan.  Chloe Sullivan was kind of like Clark's Private Investigating team buddy, just like Lois was in Lois and Clark. Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are like the Adult Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk of Lois and Clark.

We see a deeper more personal side of Superman that other TV series or movies lack. We get a glimps into the true character of a hero and his human traits.

The special effects in the season are much better than the previous. It comes across as a sci-fi fantasy, but deep down its a romantic comedy full of action and suspense.

It takes the struggles that we all face in life dealing with our own careers, ambitions, values and search for true love. It goes to show that it doesnt matter what happens, the heart will always find its way back.",1155600000,3,806,4.36
2534917,5,B000EU1Q2W,"I just want to say this television series was one of my favs as a teenage. Now I'm 28 and have bought the first 3 seasons to relive one of the best romantic chemistry onscreen between two actors. Not only does Lois know Clark is Superman this season, but the effect of watching them fight that chemistry in season 2 and watching it blossom in season 3 is euphoric.

There was inexplicable chemistry between Teri and Dean in this season. The small touches. The passionate kisses. The partnership. The caring and concern when one was faced with dire circumstances. The looks and smiles that passed between the two when Perry or Jimmy mentioned their relationship.

Everything is tenfold in this season. I enjoyed watching Superman be overly protective of Lois, and well, Clark just being overly crazy over her tenacious ways is just as adorable. Fans will enjoy wondering whether the two go all the way or is all that necking just an appetizer for the real thing. The villains in this season aren't as good as seasons 1 and 2, but still enjoyable. And Lois & Clark are just AMAZING to watch as a couple fighting to keep peace in Metropoliz. I've watched all of seasons 1 and 2 in a week, and am halfway finished with season 3. And yes, I work 40 hours a week. It's THAT addictive.

And on a shallow note: DEAN CAIN IS F***ING HOT (His body got better and better... and how funny it was to see Mayson Drake and Lois alike melt over it)! And Teri is GORGEOUS (Though her best was season 2. The hair was beautiful and just full of body and shine! LOL) Why did Teri have to have plastic surgery. The woman was one of the most beautiful women in the 90's.

Did anyone else get excited when the short hair of Lois Lane made its debut? LMAO! I remember back in the 90's being upset that she cut her hair, but looking back, she was still beautiful. Dean and Teri have to be the most beautiful couple onscreen since forever! LOL!",1154908800,4,1918,4.409604519774011
2534918,5,B000EU1Q2W,"This is the third season of Lois and Clark and finally Lois and Clark are totally in love. The first half is brilliant and those episodes are the greatest of the entire series. In my view the introduction of Lex Luthor in a double episode ruined the season to a degree but I still rate it with the five stars it deserves. That double episode and the 2 that followed were stupid in my book and much worse than those before them and those that followed. I don't want to explain what happens as some who read this may not know what I am refering to. But the first 12-14 episodes were of high quality as were the final episodes of the season. The main storyline during this third season is the romantic relationship between Lois and Clark and the chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher was better than ever in season 3. Their obvious chemistry and working relationship is the reason why I think season 3 is the greatest of them all. You truly believe they are in love - the only two actors to accomplish that in my opinion. The only minus is the above mentioned episodes regarding Lex Luthor. The show had moved on beyond Lex and it was a bad move to return to Lex. I can guarantee that anybody that likes Superman will love season 3 but this season is more about the love between Clark and Lois than the reporters Clark and Lois. Nevertheless there are several episodes that show the reporters doing what they do best. Finally I want to repeat that this is the greatest season of Lois and Clark. Season 1 was good, season 2 was very good but season 3 is excellent. I highly recommend this season of Lois and Clark.",1154476800,4,1617,4.357615894039735

Ill tell ya this, after revisiting the third season and the wedding arc with this dvd set, the series at this point needed a huge wake up call.  The episodes were starting to feel too comfortable, too simplistic.  It needed a shocker and quite frankly the way they did it was shocking enough for me.  The series at this point needed a 5 episode arc(we hadnt seen one before up to this point).  If you remember this is a comic book based fantasy, then you should be fine.  Sure the content was a bit weird from what came before, but the show really really needed it!!

2534927,3,B000EU1Q2W,"I'm a little surprised at all the 5-star reviews for this set, as I found season 3 to be a marked decline in quality for this series.  And it's not because Lois and Clark finally got together--I'm all for that--but it's the way it was handled.  I remember well the spring of 1996 (SPOILERS AHEAD), and my disappointment at how the wedding arc dragged on week after week.  Will Lex succeed in taking Lois away from Clark forever?  Will Lois get her memory back?  Oops! She got it back but lost it again!  It's a long black mark in an otherwise decent season.

And there was plenty of nice moments: The Lois/Clark/Superman triangle initially showed some comic AND romantic promise...if not for cheesy villains-of-the-week subplots.  ""Ultra Woman"", in which Lois acquires Superman's powers, was a classic.  It was nice to finally see Lana Lang, albeit in an alternate reality (""Tempus, Anyone?"").  Mindy Church proves to be not such a dumb blonde (""Home Is Where the Hurt Is"").  And despite my above grousing about the wedding arc, John Shea gives probably his best performance as Lex finally brings the Man of Steel to his knees (""Seconds"").  The season-ending 2-parter was appropriately epic and very engaging, ending on a cliffhanger that would take 2 more episodes to resolve at the start of season 4.

If you're a fan of the series, you may be able to overlook some of the shortcomings of season 3.  The fourth season, as I recall, wasn't any better.",1151366400,3,1452,4.733067729083666
2534928,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Superman may be faster than a speeding bullet and be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but make no mistake, he's given limited exposure in this series. The focus instead is firmly on the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane, and the format is more romantic comedy than anything else. Of the four seasons Lois & Clark graced the airwaves, the third one is my favorite. It opens with Lois revealing to Clark that she knows he's in fact the Big Red S. Fans of the show were entranced as they awaited each progression resulting from Lois's discovery: from the engagement and the fake wedding, to the cloning, the bout of amnesia and finally, to Superman's departure from Earth.

Dean Cain may be the third best Superman so far (after Christopher Reeve and George Reeves, and pending on Brandon Routh) but Teri Hatcher is the best Lois Lane (apologies to Margot Kidder, who is almost as good, and Phyllis Coates). Hatcher is the main reason I tuned in to every episode when it was on prime time ABC. She instilled a spunky yet vulnerable, competitive yet fun-filled spirit into her Lois Lane that made her the premiere viewing pleasure of the series - sorry, Supes. It doesn't hurt that she's also drop-dead gorgeous. Back in the mid-90s, Teri Hatcher's image was the most accessed on the Internet. And with that one very sexy picture of her as Lois wrapped up in Superman's cape (c'mon, you know the one I mean) gracing the Internet ether, who can blame the computer groupies for downloading en masse?

With the television budget not commensurate to that of a theatrical film, the special effects were ""iffy"" and kept to a minimum. To make up for that lack, other areas of the series were tightened up. I thought the scripts were witty and amusing and the acting, laudable. I've mentioned Hatcher but Dean Cain was also very good, very easy to like. He infused his Man of Steel with a more human quality, while bestowing a more masculine, down-to-earth look on his Clark. A special mention goes out to supporting actors Lane Smith (the Elvis-adoring, gruff yet caring Perry White), K Callan and Eddie Jones (the wise, loving Ma and Pa Kent) and John Shea (the suave, ever-scheming Lex Luthor). The storylines were nicely put together, if a bit infected with the soap opera syndrome. The show recalled to mind at times certain elements of the classic screwball comedies, mostly when Lois and Clark were at rivalrous play with each other. After all these years, the give and take between the two leads are still gold, the chemistry still palpable.

It might be inevitable ""jump the shark"" to have the love interests taking the next step but, personally, I couldn't wait for these two to be with each other. I mean - Geez, finally! I took particular pleasure in watching the season opener ""We Have a Lot to Talk About"" because, as I've mentioned earlier, this is where Lois finally lets on that she knows of Clark's dual identities (yes, she also found out in season two's ""Tempus Fugitive"" but then, she forgot). Anyways, after this episode, Lois and Clark's relationship goes to another level.

Other episodes of note (besides ""We Have a Lot to Talk About"") in season 3 are:

""Ordinary People"" - Lois & Clark go on a tropical island vacation with a bet: Lois stays off journalism and Clark doesn't become Superman.

""Just Say Noah"" - Lois & Clark go undercover as a married couple.

""Ultra Woman"" - Lois gets Superman's powers.

""Tempus, Anyone?"" - An alternate reality featuring a more cynical Superman.

""Oedipus Wrecks"" - An amnesiac Lois Lane finally remembers!

""Through a Glass, Darkly"" & ""Big Girls Don't Fly"" - two part season finale; New Krypton needs Superman. But what of Earth and Lois Lane?

Special Features include ""Look, Up in the Sky! The Amazing Story of Superman"" documentary excerpts by Bryan Singer and Kevin Burns on disc 3; ""Lois & Clark: A History of Romance"" feature and ""The Man of Steel Trivia Challenge"", hosted by Dean Cain on disc 6. Very disappointed that there aren't episode commentaries here.

Lastly, I would like to thank Desperate Housewives, whose popularity made possible the release of these Lois & Clark dvds.",1150848000,7,4167,4.756232686980609
2534929,4,B000EU1Q2W,"The question is popped and the secret is finally revealed in the third season of the ABC series.  `Superman express' flies 22 episodes of the 1995-1996 season directly to your DVD player.

Because she had figured out that he was Superman just before he told her, Lois and Clark get into an argument in the season opener ""We have a lot to talk about"". The Kents try to comfort this couple with their own marital difficulties, but Lois and Clark instead decide to put marriage on hold--only for a while.

Ironically, being captured--and Clark lacking the opportunity to change into `Superman' provides the perfect opportunity for them to talk out mutual fears about marriage (""Don't tug on Superman's cape""). Both of them recognize that marriage is a very big step.

This Clark Kent thought that he was what ultimately has become known as `metrosexual' but learns that he is in fact threatened when his super powers inadvertently and temporarily get transferred over to Lois during a `red kryptonite' encounter a baddie had calculated wrong (""Ultra Woman""). While Lois learns what Clark endures as `Superman', Clark discovers that he feels disempowered without--well, `his' powers.

Lois and Clark confront a similar personal-public hurdle when a woman claims to have given birth to Superman's `love child'. Clark's adamant this the kid cannot possibly be his (we subsequently learn he is a virgin in ""Virtually destroyed""), but eyebrows are raised when the kid apparently exhibits superpowers in front of them--much like a young Clark had growing up in Smallville.

Parenting is an important and consistently believable story arc throughout this season. Up until this point, the only recurring parents were the Kents. However interesting Jonathan and Martha are in their own rights, bringing in other people's parents undoubtedly enhanced the series.

Previously much discussed, Lois's parents finally make their appearance in ""Home is where the hurt is"".  This episode is also where Superman gets his own personal physician--Dr. Sam Lane (Harve Presnell) is subsequently asked to help save Superman from an engineered Kyrptonian virus that has made Superman sick for the very first time in his life and will threaten to kill him unless removed from his body.

Ellen Lane (Beverly Garland) thinks that she's trying to help her daughter plan the perfect wedding. However, because they are both strong-willed and independent women, her `help' consequently balloons the wedding into the extravagant affair which Lois and Clark specifically did not want.

Lois wasn't the only Daily Planet staffer with a colorful family life. Jimmy Olsen's infamously absent dad (James Read) finally returns in ""The dad who came in from the cold"". He loved his son very much but the senior James Olsen frequently had to skip town frequently because of his `secret identity' being a spy is not compatible with being a constantly involved father. This revelation makes Clark think about the potentially conflicting challenges which would be posed from trying to be both a father and Superman. Even if he and Lois do have kids, will he actually be able to do everything well?  Would that kid come away with irreparable damage or still turn out to be an upstanding citizen?

Finally, our favorite couple do get married...or so we think. After building up the suspense, we have to wade through a ghastly `clone' story arc which ---still, in my opinion--never added anything whatsoever to this series.

The real Lois Lane gets kidnapped by Tempus Fugit (""Tempus anyone?"") escapes from her ordeal unscathed, but then conveniently  gets a BAD case of amnesia as she is escaping from an altogether different kidnapping (""Double jeopardy"") We don't get relief from this ridiculously divergent plot line (just how many times can an award winning investigative reporter hit her head in one season without blacking out?) until ""Oedipus wrecks"".  I'm still convinced that something really bizarre happened to the usual writers and producers of this series because this section of episodes never quite seems up to par with other episodes from this season or overall series quality. Thank goodness for the `episode selection' button on my DVD remote!--and other episodes.

Having presumed that he was the only survivor from Krypton, Clark is then genuinely taken aback to meet travelers from ""New Krypton"" and learn of his arranged marriage to Zara (Justine Bateman---who will of course remain best known as `Mallory' from `Family Ties'). Zara is herself in love with body guard Ching (Jon Tenney) but she also wants Clark to recognize and uphold his Kryptonian heritage---and go through with their obligated duties to return with them---which he seemingly does in the season 3 cliff-hanger finale. Despite being raised as an earthling, Clark is admittedly curious about his own cultural customs. However, Lois needn't have worried because Clark's genetically Kryptonian heart always emotionally belongs to her.

Extras for this season include. ""Lois & Clark: A history of romance"", excerpts from the new Bryan Singer and Kevin Burns documentary about the world's quintessential `super' hero. Dean Cain continues to pitch in to this franchise--this time with the ""Man of steel trivia challenge"" where people can see how much information they REALLY know about one of the world's most beloved icons.  A limited supply (and time-sensitive) ticket to this summer's ""Superman Returns"" movie is also included in this release (at least for now).

Even with unnecessary story arcs for this season, Lois and Clark continues being a `super' series.",1150761600,6,5602,5.211345939933259
2534930,5,B000EU1Q2W,"I was only an occasional viewer of ""Lois & Clark"" until the third season got me completely hooked. If you are a die-hard Superman fan, you may enjoy this series, but keep in mind that the Superman persona takes a backseat to the ""Lois and Clark"" relationship. The show is a romantic comedy in every way, and the third season's focus is on Lois & Clark's struggles to make it as a couple as they deal with the reality that Clark is Superman.

While not a single episode of this 22-episode season should be missed, a few shows are particularly entertaining. In the extremely creative ""Virtually Destroyed""--penned by Dean Cain himself--Lois and Clark find out what a deadly game virtual reality can really be. The next episode, ""Home Is Where the Hurt Is,"" tugs at the heartstrings as Lois keeps vigil at the bedside of a gravely ill Superman. The season-ending ""Big Girls Don't Fly"" is yet another tear-jerker as Clark and Lois are faced with the decision of whether or not Clark should leave Earth to rule over New Krypton, a planet in trouble.

Finally, while some fans dislike the ""Wedding Arc"" that occurs in the second half of the season, these episodes do not fail to keep us on the edges of our seats. Besides, how boring would it be to see our favorite couple happy all the time? This lengthy separation makes their reunion all the more satisfying. It's also great to see the return of John Shea as Lex Luthor during this arc. Born to play this role, Shea creates a character that is so easy to love to hate.",1150588800,7,1515,4.525547445255475
2534931,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Everything hinges on Lois's answer to Clark's marriage proposal--and the question of whether she knows his dual identity in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Third Season. Developed by Deborah Joy LeVine (Dawson's Creek) and a brilliant staff of writers, including [this season] stars Dean Cain (""Virtually Destroyed"") and Teri Hatcher (""It's A Small World After All""), Lois & Clark takes the Man of Steel on his most exciting and challenging adventure of all - rivalry & romance (and later marriage) with Lois Lane!

At the time, many critics and fans thought the series was tampering with success by advancing the romance between the two title characters. Not me. And certainly not the show's producers who were extremely confident (and rightfully so) about the direction the third season took. Their plan, according to producer Robert Singer, was to take it forward [then] put up an obstacle.

And as you'll discover in this super 3rd season set, there are obstacles aplenty including Intergang's Bill Church Sr. (Peter Boyle), his ditzy (or is she?) new bride Mindy (Jessica Collins) and his traitorous son Bill Church Jr. (Bruce Campbell) in ""We Have A Lot To Talk About""; the return of time traveler Tempus (Lane Davies) in ""Tempus Anyone?"" and Lex Luthor (John Shea) in the back-to-back ""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Seconds""; the nefarious Newtrich sisters (Shelley Long & Mary Gross), who unwittingly transform Lois into ""Ultra Woman""; and in the back-to-back season finale ""Through a Glass, Darkly"" and ""Big Girls Don't Fly"" two visiting Kryptonians (Justine Bateman & Jon Tenney, Teri Hatcher's then-real-life husband) who extend Clark an opportunity to reclaim his alien heritage as ruler of New Krypton, which means saying goodbye to Earth, his parents and Lois.

Episodes include:
45. ""We Have a Lot to Talk About"": As Lois's answer to Clark's proposal lingers, Metropolis becomes strangely crime-free.
46. ""Ordinary People"": Lois and Clark escape work with a getaway to a tropical island, unaware that a madman awaits them.
47. ""Contact"": Lois claims to have been abducted by aliens, and Superman feels powerless to help when she later slips into dangerous trances.
48. ""When Irish Eyes Are Killing"": Lois believes jealously is prompting Clark's accusations against her visiting Irish friend.
49. ""Just Say Noah"": Lois and Clark go undercover at a fanatical TV therapist's marriage-counseling retreat.
50. ""Don't Tug on Superman's Cape"": A wealthy couple want to capture Superman for their museum of oddities.
51. ""Ultra Woman"": The Newtrich sisters plan to destroy Superman unwittingly turns Lois Lane into a superhero.
52. ""Chip Off the Old Clark"": Lois and Clark investigate a woman who claims she bore Superman's love child.
53. ""Super Mann"": Nazis preparing for a ""new Reich"" expose Superman to a nuclear bomb that renders him radioactive.
54. ""Virtually Destroyed"": An evil computer wizard leads Lois and Clark on a death-defying tour of his virtual-reality ""fun park"".
55. ""Home Is Where the Hurt Is"": Superman battles a crime wave and a deadly flu virus during the holidays.
56. ""Never on Sunday"": Clark begins having strange visions that seem linked to supernatural forces and a voodoo-practicing illusionist.
57. ""The Dad Who Came in from the Cold"": Jimmy gets an unexpected visit from his estranged father, an enigmatic secret agent.
58. ""Tempus Anyone?"": Tempus returns to snatch Lois away to a parallel universe, where she links up with H.G. Wells and a more cynical version of Clark.
59. ""I Now Pronounce You..."": As their wedding day approaches, Lois & Clark's probe into the theft of exotic amphibians leads to a freakish biologist.
60. ""Double Jeopardy"": Lois's topsy-turvy life begins to play out like a bad novel after Lex Luthor escapes from prison.
61. ""Seconds"": Superman declares war on the maniacal Lex Luthor over Lois, who with temporary amnesia, is being primed to kill the superhero.
62. ""Forget Me Not"": Hoping to regain her memory, Lois enters a sanitarium, where Clark is forebidden to visit her.
63. ""Oedipus Wrecks"": A floodgate of memories opens for Lois just as Dr. Deter is trying to purge all thoughts of Clark from her mind.
64. ""It's a Small World After All"": Lois discovers that a vengeful former classmate is armed with a secret shrinking formula.
65. ""Through a Glass, Darkly"": A mysterious terrorist and a new Planet researcher bring nothing but chaos to Lois & Clark.
66. ""Big Girls Don't Fly"": Just as the two visiting aliens bring Superman a new-found knowledge of his past and his destiny, Lois fears that Clark is drifting away from her for good.

Lois & Clark - The Complete Third Season is a 1010 min. 6-disc set, which features all 22 episodes in full frame (1.33:1) video, and English Stereo Surround audio, French and Spanish subtitles.

Ok, it wasn't a war between clones, but it in the words of Lex this season meant ""WAR!!!""  Lex and Clark are after the heart of Lois; she is caught in the middle and suffers greatly.

Great writing, acting, and F/X for the arc make this a SUPERMAN fan necessity.  Don't believe the haters.  Rent/buy this and be amazed at the 3rd season.

The NAZI episode also rocks!!

2534935,5,B000EU1Q2W,"I think it's a great season for one main reason - okay, no spoilers right?  So let's just leave it to say something major happens between Lois & Clark - in the first episode in fact.  It changes the whole feel of the series from this point forward.

Okay, I know a lot of fans really hated the whole 'wedding arc' in this season.  And I admit that it is definitely not my favorite part of the series.  But there is some really good angst involved in the episodes it encompasses (""I Now Pronounce You"", ""Double Jeopardy"", ""Seconds"", ""Forget Me Not"" and ""Oedipus Wrecks"".)  I remember when the episodes were airing though, I was thoroughly irritated at the situation, just like everyone else was.  But I got over it and then felt like my heart had been wrenched away just a few episodes later for the season cliffhanger of ""Big Girls Don't Cry"".  I never thought that summer would be over for Season 4 to start.

Anyway, I loved Season 3 for all it was and wasn't.  I have always loved the great chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, it only got better each season and this season we really get to see the romance. My two favorite episodes were ""Ordinary People"" and ""Ultrawoman"".

I highly recommend this series - all of it.  Take it for what it is...a great love story.  Sure it's corny sometimes, and over the top other times, but come on, it's ""Superman"".  It's sci-fi/fantasy.  Don't take it too seriously.  And hey, at least it's a good clean show, unlike some of the shows on TV these days.  My recommendation - buy it, and if you haven't bought the other 2 seasons, pick them up first and watch them.  I've heard season 4 is supposed to be out before the end of the year - I can't wait.",1144368000,41,1700,4.376996805111821

2534937,5,B000EU1Q2W,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman is my favorite show of all time. The show was on for four seasons from 1993-1997. What made this show so special was the great chemistry Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had on screen along with a great supporting cast. I was a huge fan watching the first episode in the fall of 1993 (I was 16 years old) and never missed an episode. When the last episode aired in 1997 (I was 20 years old) I was sad because like so many other reviewers I grew up with this show and it was a huge part of my life. I remember every Sunday night I would look so forward to seeing Lois & Clark. Me and my best friend Maria would talk about the show the next day and say how we had so many similarities to these characters. I think it is great that after years of the fans asking Warner Brothers to release this great show that they have finally listened. The fans truly do deserve a DVD release of all four seasons of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. This show means so much to so many people because it was a good show that lasted longer than anyone ever imagined it would. The third season is another great season of Lois and Clark with better special effects and a more grown up feel.

For the show so loved Lex Luther that it rendered its own superhero FLACCID so Lex could steal Clark's bride, kidnap his mother, start a war against superman and try to kill him - while Clark/Superman barely fights back.
