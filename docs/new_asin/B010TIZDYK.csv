Does any of this title ring any bell to you?
And then this movie LOVE.
Gaspar Noe is not dead. he made another huge issued movie called LOVE and this time it is quite blur between the line of porn and  live fiction movie. But also there are a lot of innovative artistic shots to show the director's inner mental state or what he wants to show, what he wants to deliever to the audience. It is rather look more like experimental film sometime in a beautiful way.
But I also have to admit that there are overly many sexual pornish shots involved and I don't think they are all neccesarry.

As always his story is very very minimal.
A man loves a woman but falls in love with a teenager and happens to have her pregnent and couldn't get rid of her and finally they became couple.
After that he constantly feels regret.
And also he figures out that his ex dissapeared and he has this feeling that she is doped, damned and might be dead or evenly screwed her life because of him.

The movie is almost about sex between him and his ex. Steamy sex not all love but sex all the way till almost death.

If you have seen the movie EYES WIDE shot and think that that film is extreme you haven't seen anything yet cause seeing this, that one is just a kid's toy.
This party scene, this sex scenes and everything.
Of course they used body double and all for the penetration and all but for blowjobs and jerking off the man's peanuts, they are all real with real actor's acting.

The story is as I already mentioned, about regret and flashbacks about having sex with ex.
Nothing more.

It is really confusing we are watching a porn or live action film sometimes but with classic beautiful music and good actors somehow it is not a porn.
With also good lighting and camera also involved too.
And along comes provocative shots towards the camera you know it is Caspar Noe we are talking about a rebell kid from France we all heard of.

If you want to see this movie in public don't do that.
It might ruin your image.

But still worth watching.
It still got style and new techinuqe to look at.

I haven't watched the 3D version yet but the 2D was enough for me yet to see that he is still active in terms of showing how much provocative artist he still is.",1473811200,2,2283,4.278422273781903

8723159,3,B010TIZDYK,"While I appreciate the filmmaker's dedication to making a realistic, explicit film about broken people, the fact that they cast a man who has no skillsets whatsoever (other than being attractive) was a consistent downer throughout.  Ultimately it kind of serves the plot, I suppose.

It's worth watching once if you're already a fan of French films exploring broken characters, and aren't bothered by explicit activities.",1534291200,,421,5.363636363636363
8723160,5,B010TIZDYK,"One of the most intensely sensual movies I have ever seen. It is not ""porn,"" but some scenes are very explicit and graphic.

There is one scene (1 or 2 min) at the very end that I don't quite understand, and for that reason, I usually stop watching at that point.",1529020800,,263,4.1568627450980395

8723167,2,B010TIZDYK,"I thought the 3D aspect on this video would be interesting, but this particular version of the title is the Rated-R version which is greatly inferior to the un-rated version available only in 2D.  The movie itself the quality of the product are all fine and as advertised, but I would recommend getting the un-rated version of this title unless the explicit graphic nature of the sexual scenes are too pornographic for your tastes.",1482105600,3,431,4.824324324324325
