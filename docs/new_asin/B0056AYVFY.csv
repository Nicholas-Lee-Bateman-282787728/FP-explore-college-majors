4587895,3,B0056AYVFY,"After seeing the Sean Penn movie and reading Jon Krakauer's book, some may feel a little disappointed in this DVD.  However, this is not a hollywood movie, it is simply a documentary of Chris's journey.  I think that it was made similar to how Chris lived his life during those years of his travels.  Although a bit long, it is interesting to hear from the friends he made along his travels.  One criticism is that it would have been more interesting to see the different narrators instead of the voice-overs.  I liked the music that was chosen, it enhances the DVD.  It is definitely beneficial to own both the book and DVD.",1315958400,2,625,4.535714285714286
4587896,1,B0056AYVFY,"A slow, boring slide show.........
I thought having the DVD with the book was a good idea - WRONG!!!!!  I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this ""DVD"" as it is only an expensive slide show that is painfully slow and totally boring.  Granted that reference to Chris McCandless photos have to be still shots - but there is nothing going on in this DVD at all - not even from the LIVING people who contributed narrative etc.!!!  Glad I got the book first as it is wonderful.  This DVD is a real rip-off.  I don't recommend this DVD to anyone.  Buyer BEWARE.",1314057600,12,551,4.405940594059406

8459387,5,B0056AYVFY,"being able to see the photos he took was amazing, i'd love to do what he did it took alot of courage and strength, i would highly recomment this to anyone who loved into the wild, bc this is even better. way more depth",1358121600,,218,3.977272727272727
8459388,5,B0056AYVFY,"If you are looking for a closer connection and real view of Chris's adventure, buy this DVD. His photos are incredible and I love to see the timeline of his journey through these photos. It is not hollywood's depiction of this story. It is literally Chris's aesthetic journal of his adventure out west and eventually into the wild of Alaska. It was the missing piece that I was looking for after reading the book and seeing the movie.",1354924800,,434,4.576923076923077
8459389,1,B0056AYVFY,"I just watched this and I felt as if I was watching a Junior High school produced video....I would rate Public Access television programs better than this. How Hal Holbrook (Who was so wonderful in INTO THE WILD) would have any involvement with this project is simply beyond me. I see that Chris' Dad directed....I'm not sure what he directed because all it is a collage of pictures over poorly composed music that desperately trys to sound like Eddie Vedders and clearly scripted narrations with nothing but assumptions for every facial expression and gestures in Chris' self portraits. Really a dispointment, and lessens my fascination with the whole story....what's really sad is if this is what was created by the ones who claim they loved him most....I can see quite clearly Chris went into the wild.",1346457600,,805,4.926470588235294
8459390,5,B0056AYVFY,"unbelievable pictures of an Americon Icon. If you have read into the wild and seen the movie of the same name, and wanted more, this is a great book to add to your collection. Plus it helps the non profit agency set up by his parents to help needy children.",1338595200,,257,4.16
8459391,2,B0056AYVFY,"just wasn't impressed with the production quality or the contents of DVD, beside's it being just a 'lazy mans' version of the book. Just the same pictures being presented to you with someone reading the captions and letters.",1321833600,,224,4.921052631578948
8459392,5,B0056AYVFY,"Chris McCandless's story has been told through magazine articles, a book ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer, and a film of the same name.
However, none of these are actually Chris's own story exactly - but were we ever going to hear Chris's own story?
I believe that this DVD and the accompanying book, ""Back into the Wild"" is about as close as we are ever going to get.
He have Chris's own photographs and almost every postcard and letter that Chris wrote on his two year ""journey"" is reproduced here, read by the people that Chris wrote them to. We also have the stories from those who actually met Chris. They lived, worked and travelled along with him, up until he left for Alaska on his last adventure.
These are only sad and poignant stories in retrospective. Told by the people who were there they hold the excitment and thrill that Chris would have felt as his adventure unfolded. At the time, he really did not know where or how it would all end. He was clearly enjoying every minute of it. To me, it feels like Chris ""lived"" more in those two years than most people do in a lifetime.
The sad part is that he paid the ultimate price for his dreams - as so many others have. Even the most highly skilled, with years of experience, fall foul due to circumstance, a moments lack of concentration, or their luck just ran out.
What exactly happened we'll never know. What's more important is what Chris was trying to achieve, what he was about, what he was trying to say in his own way. This DVD is as close as we'll get to knowing that.
Worth every penny and I wish the Foundation every success.",1320537600,6,1597,4.380471380471381
8459393,4,B0056AYVFY,"I asked several of my student to read ""Into the Wild."" Because some students do not enjoy reading I decided to purchase this DVD to amend instruction and have something for the students to view as they read the book. The pictures were beautiful and inspiring! It really helped my students get into the book and connect to the story. It helped to fuel discussion of the book and really inhanced their learning. Thank you for this magnificient piece of art.",1319155200,,455,4.62962962962963
8459394,4,B0056AYVFY,"""Back to the Wild"" DVD is something the book & movie ""Into the Wild"" fall short of. This is not a Hollywood style movie, rather a documentary with many actual writings & photographs that portray a better sense of depth & reality to Chris's journey.  This DVD is exactly what I was hoping for.",1315958400,,292,4.407407407407407
