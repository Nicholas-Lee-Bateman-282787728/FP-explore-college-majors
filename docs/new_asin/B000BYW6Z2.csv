2449894,5,B000BYW6Z2,"There are a lot of intermediate yogis out there who struggle with what ""advanced"" yoga is.  Transitions from beginner to intermediate are typically very easy and systematic in yoga, with most people learning from a book or a tape and eventually progressing to a yoga basics class and then eventually to an intermediate ""all levels"" practice.  Many systems, most notably Ashtanga yoga taught in the Mysore tradition, emphasize a day to day individual progression in the various yoga postures.  Because of the dedication and discipline this requires-from both student and teacher-this kind of training is a rarity.  Many traditional Ashtanga schools are either very small, or end up teaching more streamlined led classes.

Advanced yoga, whether it's David Swenson running through the primary series, a Baron Baptiste photograph, or an Ana Forrest demonstration, can be seen as a combination of three components: breath, arm balances, and hip/leg flexibility.  With clear and direct instruction, Yee models with stunning alignment the various aspects of yoga mastery individually.  Exercises to open the hips, instructions and tips on hand balances, and an introduction to pranayama, are dealt with separately.  This is significant, because it shortens and demystifies the learning curve, and illuminates the clear progression of a devoted practice.  If you are an advanced yogi, or a gymnast or dancer, and have sufficient flexibility, upper body strength, and balance, this dvd will be a wonderful journey into the heart and soul of the most challenging yoga postures with a seasoned veteran as your guide sharing what works for him.

While Yee provides ample instruction, it's important to note that the DVD will not take you from the intermediate to advanced level.  For me, it was eye opening and led me to do a couple of things to augment my practice so I can eventually reach this level of proficiency.  First, I emphasize hip opening much more than I used to, and add a short sequence of postures and stretches almost every day to reach a higher level of flexibility.  Second, I spend some amount of time each day training to fluidly support weight on my hands, my reference to this is the york hand balancing course, which is free online and found after a quick Google search.  I recommend this to yogis especially since many of its instructions are actually yoga postures, but they hearken to a time well before yoga achieved recognition in the states, much less popularity.

All in all, an excellent guide for advanced practitioners and inspiring for intermediates.",1157846400,81,2574,5.124401913875598

2449896,5,B000BYW6Z2,"This DVD is exactly what I needed.  I am blessed with plenty of natural flexibility and strength, so after enjoying Rodney's beginner programs this higher level gave me an inspirational push.  Even if you can't get into all the positions, by this stage you know how to modify and if not, the gorgeous Maui scenery will heal your body and soul.",1150070400,5,343,4.60655737704918
2449897,5,B000BYW6Z2,"I have purchased Rodney Yee DVDs for the past five years, progressing from the basic ones, through the intermediate to this advanced DVD.  Rodney Yee has put together another great DVD.  This DVD is by no means meant for a beginner.  I would not advise any one to try the routines without three or more years of consistent yogic practice.  Otherwise, you could either hurt yourself or just wind up frustrated from not being able to keep up with the sequence(s).

With the disclaimer out of the way let me tell you that this is a great DVD.  I have practiced to Rod Yee's DVD's for a long time, and this one is the best one yet.  People who are familar with Yee will find that the pace of this DVD is a bit faster than normal, so I would advise watching the DVD before following along.  He moves through the poses quickly and effortlessly.  He will stay a bit longer in really advanced poses and arm balances, but for the most part moved right through the sequence.

The 1st DVD includes two sequences, an arm balancing and hip opener coming in at approximately 50 and 25 minutes respectively.  The arm balancing sequence includes alot of intermediate to advanced arm balances (e.g. a few advanced versions of headstand, crow pose, balancing while one leg is over the should and opposite  leg is extended, and a few I hope to be able to do in the next five years).  The hip opener sequence is amazing.  Normally it takes me 60 minutes of doing Ashtanga Yoga before I can even consider sitting in a full lotus, with Yee's DVD I could sit comforatably after 20 minutes of his routine.  The arm balance sequence does include a lot of the hip opening poses you will see in the hip opening sequence.  The hip opening sequence includes alot of half and full lotus based poses including rooster poses (sitting in full lotus and balancing your weight on your hands).  The breath work is a good DVD as well, but my interest is moreso in the poses than the pranayama.  Again, this is a fantastic DVD if you have the yogic background.  I cannot stress enough that if you are fairly new to yoga or you are looking to start doing yoga, then this DVD should only be used as a source of inspiration for where you hope to be in the next few years.",1144713600,93,2230,4.3951219512195125
2449898,4,B000BYW6Z2,"Rodney Yee is one of the best.  I do have 2 of his other dvd's and yet this is truly advanced and not recommended for those with flexibility issues or those who haven't tried yoga before.  This is truly an advanced dvd and whilst it is excellent (because it will give you a great workout and because Rodney is so professional), if you aren't a big yoga person or have trouble getting and staying in some of the usuall yoga positions, then this isn't for you.  I've done some yoga before and thought I could challenge myself with this, but it's still pretty tough.  Not for everyone.",1141257600,30,582,4.411214953271028

2449930,5,B000BYW6Z2,The advanced section was great but I'm still working up a lot of the poses and may never be able to do some of them. I was particularly pleased with the hip opener sequence he does. The sequence has helped me with my flexibility. I have purchased a few different DVDs and taken some out at the library but I consistently find Rodney Yee to be the best most comprehensive teacher.,1390262400,,379,4.352112676056338
2449931,5,B000BYW6Z2,"In search of a home yoga practice featuring arm balances, I've tried ""Advanced Vinyasa Flow Yoga: Strength and Balance"" with
Jenny Rawlings and Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti.""  Rodney Yee's video is by far the most advanced and I find it the most enjoyable.  It involves transitions from headstands to arm balances in quick succession, so it will take time for me to work up to his speed.  However, I do not find the learning process overwhelming or intimidating, probably in part due to his calm and even demeanor.  In addition, his rhythmic stretching sequences have allowed me to open up my hips and legs far more quickly than other practices.  This workout is challenging for flexibility, strength and balance.  It does not involve sun salutations.  If you prefer a more vigorous cardio yoga sequence, either Jenny Rawlings or Shiva Rea will get your heart rate up.  Jenny Rawlings has pleasant intermediate sequences- I wouldn't call them advanced- that provide what I consider basic yoga practices.  Shiva Rea's Yoga Shaki is an excellent video for creating your own practice out of her matrix of mini-sequences so you can customize your yoga practice.  She also features advanced arm balances and sun salutations on the Yoga Shakti DVD.",1376092800,11,1238,4.995121951219512
2449932,5,B000BYW6Z2,"Ive been doing yoga going on 20 years now and teach yoga at dauphin Island, a small island off the gulfcoast.  I learned yoga with rodney and have every single dvd and video he has made.  recommend!",1363392000,,198,4.324324324324325
2449933,5,B000BYW6Z2,"I've been doing Yoga regularly for about 4 years now. I started with the Yoga zone beginner DVD's and loved them. I upgraded to ""Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Total Body Workout""  and was absolutely thrilled with it! I've ordered various other DVD's from various Yoga practitioners but none of them really seemed very unique or impressed me. I watched them once or twice and never looked at them again. I've stuck with ""Power Yoga - Total Body Workout"" and enjoyed everything about Rodney Yee so much that I thought I'd give him another shot when looking to advance my practice. ""Advanced Yoga"" is dead-on fantastic!

There are plenty of detailed reviews that do a good job of summarizing what's on this video. I think the very best thing I can offer is to say that if you like Rodney Yee, especially ""Power Yoga - Total Body Workout"", and you're looking for more variety and more advanced poses, ""Advanced Yoga"" is exactly what you're looking for. You will love it! I watched it once through the day I received it and giggled with glee the entire way through. It was exactly what I had hoped for.

And interestingly enough - it not only has a great variety of poses that focus on the entire body, but the two main areas of focus are strength - especially in the arms and upper body - and the hips - mine are very tight. I've always been a runner, so my hips and hamstrings need a lot of work to loosen them up. This DVD set really focuses on the hips. And I wanted a lot of strength poses because I don't want to be skinny and lanky. I want to be flexible and have great balance, and yet be powerful at the same time. I'm very strong, but it's going to take me a year or more to work up to some of these poses - they're incredible - exactly what I was hoping for.

I've noticed that several reviews mention that he moves too quickly in between poses. Well, people don't listen very well. Rodney says right at the beginning (to paraphrase) ""it may seem that I move too quickly from pose to pose, but work at your own pace and build up to it"" - so he's clearly doing it for good reason. These are extremely advanced poses and you (and I) will eventually build up to his pace. One reviewer said he thought the pace was too fast at first, but this grew to become his favorite DVD - and I can completely see why someone might feel that way.

I'm absolutely thrilled with ""Advanced Yoga"". I feel it was exactly as advertised and is everything I love about Rodney Yee - spiritual and soothing, smooth and graceful, and yet incredibly challenging with a wide variety of poses covering everything including strength, stamina, flexibility, and balance from head to toe.",1317340800,16,2656,4.40122199592668
2449934,5,B000BYW6Z2,This one is not you average yoga DVD. It is really fast and explores some tough arm balances. If you try and keep trying eventually this dvd becomes easy and you'll be doing both routines in one session. This one has a high sweat average so wear a shirt for some poses the sweat makes your arms too slick. I gave it five stars because after two weeks of doing this one five days a week you will see a big difference if you can complete it.,1311292800,2,439,4.057471264367816
2449935,4,B000BYW6Z2,"If you want this to be a real workout, and not just a performance routine, keep the pause button on your DVD handy so you can stay in the poses for a bit longer than Rodney does in this video.  Otherwise, it seems to be an excellent routine in a market - advanced yoga - that it's hard to find DVDs for.",1308960000,3,303,3.8870967741935485
2449936,5,B000BYW6Z2,"This DVD provides a great mix of positions to prepare you for each arm balance. Plus, the way the DVD is set up you are suddenly prepared for each level of difficulty.  The DVD is challangeing and informative.",1307577600,,209,4.5
2449937,4,B000BYW6Z2,"This is truly an advanced program; I've been doing yoga for several years and there's lots here I can't and probably won't ever be able to do. He also moves very quickly between positions, which can be hard on the knees, even if you're in good shape. Having said that, it's amazing to watch, and I do use the section on hip openers, which just about anyone could use with some modifications. There is a whole separate disk on breathing, which I have tried twice but cannot get into at all. The subject spends the whole time with her head bent down to her chest, which just instinctively feels wrong to me. Guess I haven't ""evolved"" there yet, but don't plan to watch that any longer. Find it slow and frustrating, which is not helpful. Overall, if you are a yoga enthusiast, or young, strong, and agile, there is a place in your collection for this dvd.",1299369600,4,853,4.439490445859873
2449938,5,B000BYW6Z2,"Rodney Yee is my all time favorite yoga instructor to watch on DVD.  I just love the way he directs his videos to be soothing, yet challenging.  His voice is always very soothing.  He purposefully moves from one posture to another.  This particular video is for those who are intermediate to advanced in their practice.  It is not recommended for beginners.  This video should be added to any advanced practicioners library, who wants some spice and fluidity to their practice.",1294358400,,477,4.9
2449943,5,B000BYW6Z2,"I have a long-term daily yoga practice.  I travel a lot, and I use yoga DVD's when I am on the road.  I find a lot of the yoga DVD's are geared toward beginners -  and although I do enjoy a good foundation class, I have more than enough of them in my collection.

The first time I did this Rodney Yee practice, I felt it was too fast for me.  I tend to take my time to get into the full extension of postures.
Rodney Yee moves so quickly in this video, the speed can be relentless when you are trying to get into the more difficult postures, or even if you just want to take your time to breathe deeper into a posture.

However!  After sticking with the practice a few more times, I got into the groove of the pace, and I am now loving this video.
It's great to incorporate it into my usual practices, to shake things up.  At this point, it's become one of my favorite videos, and I now see the quick tempo of the practice as it's own kind of meditation.

The technique for hip openers here, is more about doing it repetitively for a short spurts of time, as opposed to holding a posture for a longer time, and then moving onto another posture.  You come back to ""cobbler's pose""  (Baddha Konasana)  consistently between every asana.  In fact, the majority of this practice is sitting.  When you are not sitting, you are either in an arm balance, or an inversion.
There are a number of inversions -- Headstand 1 and 2 with variations, Forearm stand with variations, and a number of advanced arm-balancing moves.

This is definitely advanced.  I can understand why beginners/advanced beginners might not find satisfaction with this practice.  But, for people who might be looking for a bit of a challenge, it might just hit the spot.  If it's too quick for you at first -- give it a few tries, and learn the routine.
I'm glad I gave it a chance.

One reason I always have to stop the DVD  --- in the middle of the practice, he does a ""seated compass"" on the right side --- but forgets to do it on the left!  That's a bummer!",1283040000,5,2023,4.257217847769029
2449944,3,B000BYW6Z2,"I like Rodney Yee and I'm glad to have the opportunity to learn some of the more challenging inverted poses. However, this sequence is not a normal vinyasa flow with an inverted section (like his ""Intermediate Yoga"" DVD) or inverted poses inserted. It is mostly seated poses, with inversions inserted. You do A LOT of cobbler's pose, staff pose, etc. It's difficult to build heat. If you want hip flexibility mixed with inversions, then you'll like it. The second section on hip flexibility (25 minutes) is a lot like the first practice (50 minutes) except with the inversions removed. Again, tons of cobbler, staff, half lotus, etc. He does do pigeon one time, but the seated hip openers are a little limited I think.",1270339200,15,718,4.798387096774194
2449945,3,B000BYW6Z2,"I love Rodney Yee's yoga workouts. I thought I would challenge myself by ordering this one. However, I really overestimated my ability-- this is CRAZY YOGA! WHOA- way beyond what most of us can handle.

It's interesting to see how advanced yoga can be, but I only watched it once. After that, I never had any use for it.

Unless you are just curious to see really advanced stuff without the chance to be able to do it yourself, I would recommend you buying a different Rodney Yee video.",1252713600,9,486,4.449438202247191
2449946,5,B000BYW6Z2,"While the main part of the DVD is extremely challenging and way beyond my abilities as a novice to intermediate yogi, the hip opening sequence is easy, accessible, and absolutely fantastic. It was reccomended to me by someone who works in a fitness store, when I was telling him about how i have chronically tight hips from running.

With the exception of a couple of poses, which you can sit out or just attempt your best, the exercises are easy and relaxing -- this is not a workout, but an adjunct to one. When I do the hip opening sequence on a regular basis, I can see a tremendous difference in my hip flexibility.

I highly reccomend this to anyone who has problems with tightness in their hips. Dont be intimidated by the advanced nature of the rest of the DVD.",1231200000,17,769,4.446808510638298

2449948,5,B000BYW6Z2,"Again...i wanted to challenge myself in my yoga practice and felt i was ready so i bought myself this dvd. I cannot say anything negative about this DVD really. At first, i had some difficulty keeping up with the ""arm balance"" section because Rodney moved a little fast through it, but after that i got the hang of it (as witn any new dvd). I felt satisfied and got a great yoga workout. It really works your arm balance poses and opens up the hips, an area i still have difficulty with but i see an increase of flexibility already. Rodney is calm and very informative, specially in the breathing section. The settings are very peaceful and appeal to the eye.
But...this DVD is not for beginners in any way!!! you can easely harm yourself if you are not flexible or already have at least 2-3 years of GOOD yoga experience and some arm balance poses. There are a few poses (arm balance) i still cant do so i skip those and practice additionally in my own time to strenghten and when ready ill follow the Flow completely and safely.
This DVD is truely inspirational and I feel Rodney really delivers. So its worth buying if you really want to challenge yourself.",1200614400,7,1160,4.476415094339623

For a long time, I did not have any recommendations I felt comfortable giving... until I started looking into the Rodney Yee DVDs for myself.  I have always had ample classes and instroctors from which to choose, so using DVDs was never a priority until my students began wanting help in choosing theirs.

That said, this particular DVD, as has been stated many times is not for beginners at all.  If you are intermediate, be prepared to ""let go"" of the poses for which your body is not ready.

For the advanced practitioner or the intermediate student who just needs a teacher to bring them up to the next level, this DVD is perfection.  The discussion about how to move into the poses is spot-on, and the hip opening sequence is the best choreographed and most effective I've come across.

I highly recommend this DVD, but if you know that your body is not quite ready, I can also say, with confidence, that any Rodney Yee DVD is going to be helpful in your yoga endeavors.",1189814400,17,1084,4.472081218274112

2449952,5,B000BYW6Z2,"At first I would like to make a few comments about myself. This might make it easier for you to judge if this review is helpfull for you or not. I praktice Yoga (Power Vinyasa Yoga) since about 6 Years.  teach Yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Studio and praktice every day. Since I'm german, my english, exspecially the spelling, is far from perfect. Please excuse that.

About the DVD: The Armbalance series is very advanced stuff. There are a lot of preparations like Streches and such before and between the Armbalances, but since most of the advanced Armbalances are done the classical way (Going into an headstand than moving into the Armbalance, than back to headstance (see Iyengars ""Light of Yoga"" Book to compare)it is only for very skilled and advanced people. If you can't imagine going into an headstand, than from there going into Bakasana (Crow-pose) and than back to headstand, this workout is not for you. Even though I can do all Armbalances in the Workout, I can't do them all starting from headstand and not so many in a short time. And I have to say that Armbalances are my favourite and I practise some every day. This is really very advanced stuff, but it is great for any experienced Yogi who wants to push his body and mind further to the edge.

The hip-opening-routine is great! It is medicine and for everybody. The hips are so important for your Yoga practise, and they're often very tight and overlooked. The second DVD is about Pranayama. Very interesting for everybody who is interested in all the advanced meditative Aspects of Yoga. Rodny guides a student through the breathing exercises in a very professionell way.

Rodny Yee is a very gentil and highly skilled Instructor. I really recommend this programm! But the armbalance workout is only for very Advanced people.

By the way, the setting in the DVD is beautifull.

I've learned yoga myself entirely from DVDs, and the most advanced I had done prior to this was Rodney's Intermediate one. Even if you are already an ""intermediate yogi"" don't expect it to be a seamless transition. I would say it will take at least a half dozen practices to assess where you're at. Myself it took about eight or nine practices and now I can do a lot of the most challenging stuff. I believe that I will master this DVD (I could be wrong and I will update the review, lol, if that is ultimately not the case), and so I just want to help anyone that is out there who is weighing whether or not to actually buy/try this one.

As for the DVD itself it does feel like that it is quite an accomplishment to genuinely be performing a lot of this stuff. And although, I did experience some challenges in yoga certainly prior to this, I'll admit that I didn't think I'd ever achieve much that is on here.
