156894,5,0792844785,"I'd heard and read about this film since I was a kid in the 60's but never got the chance to see it until recently. I suggest you do the same! It's kinda like ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court"", ""Brigadoon"" and ""Wizard Of Oz"" wrapped into one.
Cantor is a citizen of the American town, West Rome and suddenly finds himself transported to Ancient Rome. David Manners is a co-star and is much better in this film than in the Universal horror classics (like ""Dracula"") where he played a somewhat smarmy, prissy hero. He goes from bad guy, to good guy, to romantic guy, to action hero and I actually enjoyed him in this film. Gloria Stuart, who played ""Old Rose"" in 1997's TITANIC, plays Princess Sylvia, and is she ever a hotsy-totsy! Lucille Ball gets billing on the VHS back cover, but none in the film. She's basically just one of the many ""Goldwyn Girls"" featured. You can also catch a glimpse of Lucy's best friend at the time, Barbara Pepper, another hot Goldwyn Girl who went on to star as Mrs. Ziffel in the 1960's GREEN ACRES tv show! There's a great Busby Berkeley ""slave market"" scene with the girls stripped naked (honest!), shackled, with their long, flowing blond hair covering all their major body parts. Need more? Some of the jokes are predictable but I found myself laughing aloud at some of the pratfalls. How did the stuntmen survive some of these scenes without being seriously injured? Especially in the great chariot chase scene at the end with Cantor and Manners running from the bad guys. This is great, classic 1930's stuff and if you enjoy old films, this won't let you down.",1025913600,14,1610,4.59375
156895,5,0792844785,"Arguably Cantor's best film (with ""Whoopee"" and ""Kid Millions"" a close second and third), blessed with a great central premise (a la ""A Connecticut Yankee""), terrific performances (watch for Lucille Ball as one of the Goldwyn Girls in ""Keep Young and Beautiful""), and a great score (the aforementioned number, as well as ""Put a Tax on Love"" and ""Build a Little Home"").  A truly captivating time capsule of the musical diversions made to offset the Great Depression, and a compelling reminder of why Cantor was reckoned one of the bright lights of his day!",1014076800,5,555,4.904255319148936
156896,5,0792844785,"Yes, I'm under 30, and I love this movie.  This is Depression-era musical entertainment at its finest: it's got Eddie Cantor, Ruth Etting, Busby Berkeley directed dance numbers, a chariot race, big sumptuous art deco sets, and truckloads of scantily dressed chorus girls!  Although it has its corny moments, it's hardly ever sappy and never slow: a lot of the jokes are still funny, even after 70 years, and the songs are really incredibly catchy, especially ""Build a Little Home"" and ""Keep Young and Beautiful.""  The plot is whimsical fantasy at its most charming: it's something of a cross between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.""  By '30's standards, ""Scandals"" was risque, and by today's standards, it's not particularly politically correct.  But who cares? It's loads of fun!  (Interestingly enough, I once heard ""Keep Young and Beautiful"" on an episode of ""Daria.""  An instrumental version was playing over the credits.  I never would have thought I would have heard a song by Warren & Dubin on MTV...)",981158400,19,1048,4.9147727272727275
156897,5,0792844785,"Having seen this movie numerous times throughout the years has given it a special place in my heart. I first saw this film as a young kid and found it entertaining on the physical comedy alone. As an adult I enjoy it now  for different reasons of course. The laughing lava gas scene is pulled off  by all involved. Eddie was a fine comedian and the cast all shine. Besides  it's a fun movie to watch. Sure some of the songs my be corny (as well as  the humor) by todays standards, but what fun. I never tire of this one. And  can only hope that a younger generation will discover it's magic and  overlook the technical shortcomings as well as it's dated format. Enjoy. I  know that I will again and again.",948499200,7,705,4.2556390977443606
156898,4,0792844785,"This was Eddie Cantor's most successful movie and it's good fun. He plays Eddie(!) who lives in Rome, Oklahoma.  In the early part of the film there's a beautiful young blonde girl who announces to everyone: ""Here comes Eddie!""  - It's 22 year old Lucille Ball in her very first appearance on film!  Eddie dreams he's in Rome of yore and there's hardly a dull part in the whole movie - it's really very funny.  Cantor was 41 when he did this but  you'd never guess it;  the elusive Ruth Etting sings ""No More Love"" and the Goldwyn Girls get into ""Keep Young and Beautiful"".  Gloria Stuart of ""Titanic"" fame is young and gorgeous here and Edward Arnold is very modern in his comedy playing.  Interestingly enough the film has bookends a la ""The Wizard of Oz"" (although there is no technicolor)and the theme of the film is ""Build a Little Home"" One must remember that 1933 was nearly 70 years ago; if you can't stand the corn, get out of the field!",944006400,16,946,4.427745664739884

156902,5,0792844785,A nice clean VHS recording of an old Eddie Cantor classic.  The moral and social messages of this film are as topical today as they were ~75 years ago. A fun romp showing off the Goldman Girls.  It's a shame they haven't digitally restored this to DVD or BluRay.,1287360000,,262,4.326530612244898
156903,3,0792844785,"If you do not expect too much then this can be a fun movie. It runs along the lines of ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"". Eddie Cantor wakes up in Roman times and has a number of adventures. You have to take in account the age of this movie and decide if the comedy of this era appeals to you or not. I like Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and though this was not as funny, it was enjoyable.",1282348800,,405,3.951219512195122
156904,5,0792844785,I've seen this film many times now and I never tire of it. Eddie has so much zest you can't help but be swept along. The film looks great. It's funny. Great songs and gorgeous Goldwyn girls! What more could you ask for? When will his films be released on DVD???,1280534400,,261,4.137254901960785
156905,5,0792844785,"This was my first look at Eddie Cantor, whom I subsequently saw in a few other films. I thought he was funny, a very entertaining entertainer - a guy who could sing well and tell jokes and perform slapstick comedy.

With all that, Cantor reminded me a bit of the Marx Brothers. He could fit in with those guys, particularly Groucho with his comparable wit and short stature.

 In between the gags and the sappy Roman days story were at least three songs by Canotr, who was a decent singer and whose songs were pretty good, along with two Busby Berkely numbers with a bunch of scantily-clad ladies. It's corny stuff but it's still good. Lucille Ball is supposed to be in here but I didn't spot her in the two times I've watched this movie. I hardly recognized Gloria Stuart, too.

The last part of the movie was similar to the climax of many a silent film comedy with a great chase scene. Cantor, a la Ben-Hur, raced his chariot with four white horses. Instead of an arena, however, Cantor raced through the countryside. There were great stunts and funny bits in that race.

It was a great finish to a dated-but-very entertaining film. I wonder why Cantor's films are not available on DVD? I hope that oversight is corrected soon.",1240272000,,1229,4.518018018018018
156906,4,0792844785,"The musical comedy ROMAN SCANDALS was scripted by George Kaufman (Broadway playwright for the Marx Bros. and others). It's the story of a young history buff named Eddie (Cantor) from West Rome, OK who dreams he's living in 3rd Century Rome. Sold as a slave, 'Oedipus' ends up as food taster in the court of Emperor Valerian. Political intrigues in the old capital of the ancient world mirror the corruption going on in modern West Rome.

7792640,3,0792844785,"The movie is a 5-star for me because I enjoy pre-code movies. However, the media is on a cheap burned DVD-R.

7792641,3,0792844785,"One of Cantor's best vehicles, and made by some of Hollywood's best talent (Busby Berkeley, Gregg Toland). It is a product of its time, and some might find it a bit non-PC, but it does have its charms. This version is a DVD-R, and suffers from that level of quality, but, as such product goes, this one isn't too bad. It is the best, and most intact, print I have ever seen (but I've never seen it in a real theater). It is a shame it wasn't released in Blu-ray, given how well-known the film happens to be (Lucille Ball's first feature, and she appears in several scenes as a Goldwyn Girl).  Still, if this all we get, it is well worth the money, and tolerably good in a home theater.",1503619200,,685,4.229007633587786
