8213806,5,B000UMM9UC,"This three-DVD set of ""Good Eats"" episodes really lives up to the name ""'Good Eats' Greats""! These are three of the best DVDs in the Alton Brown universe, and that's high praise indeed. ""A Snack in the Hand"" covers, you guessed it, snacks, and I particularly recommend the recipes for ""Homemade Soft Pretzels"" and ""Pocket Pies"", though sadly dieters need not apply. ""Alton's Liquid Assets"" is one of the most unusual discs in that the ""Water Works I"" and ""Water Works II"" are way more science than cooking shows (I especially like the special guest star spot for a very polar water molecule in ""Water Works II""), while the third episode on that disc, ""Milk Made"", is all about milk from how it's produced to what to do with it. Perhaps my favorite disc in the set is ""Protein Power"" which features a host of interesting topics and delicious recipes like ""Pistachio Fruit Balls"", ""Lentil Soup"", and ""Tall and Tangy Tofu Thangy"".

Whether you want some culinary entertainment with a dose of humor or simply want to know the significance of 104.45 degrees (Hint: it's not a temperature...), ""'Good Eats' Greats"" is an excellent choice.",1443139200,4,1132,4.805128205128205
8213807,5,B000UMM9UC,"I am an Alton Brown fan.  So when my husband gave me this set for Valentine's day a few years ago, I thought he was the sweetest guy in the world.  I mean, you gotta love a man who gives you Alton Brown wrapped up with a bow, right?

These episodes are fantastic, and have stood up to many viewings over the years.  I love that I can sit down and watch it with my son, and he's as entertained as I am.  After watching one of the DVDs from the set, I feel inspired to head to the kitchen and conquer eggs or meatloaf.

One of my favorite features of the set is the Ask Alton section after each episode.  This is where he pulls letters out of a mail bag and answers questions about the ingredients he used in the episode.  Alton Brown's wonderful personality and sense of humor really shine through while he's answering questions and I can't help but think how cool it would be to hang out and have a couple of beers with him.  Of course, I'd prefer his homebrew...",1250899200,3,963,4.134408602150538
8213808,5,B000UMM9UC,"How can you go wrong? Even when he does a show on something that you don't like (for example, eggplant), the show is still entertaining.  Plus, how can you go wrong with breakfast?",1207353600,3,180,4.454545454545454
8213809,4,B000UMM9UC,"Alton Brown is always entertaining and educational.  By the time he is done, you will know the proper tools to use, how to purchase the highest quality food, where it comes from, why it is or is not nutritionally valuable and how to make it taste delicous.  Not only will you learn all this, but you will have a laugh or two while doing it.",1202947200,4,340,4.2153846153846155
