8434507,1,B004LNWRO4,"too much concentrated on people and not enough of the Keys in general, boring and poor value, wast of time and money!!!",1402617600,,119,4.454545454545454
8434508,2,B004LNWRO4,"We ordered this video as part of our trip planning and were a little
disappointed in the contents. Perhaps I didn't read well enough
the description in advance though. It focused on many of the
parks, preserves, museums history and such. Although it
was interesting it didn't contain the things we would have
found more of interest  like the different character of towns
restaurants, bars, sights, tours and activities.",1389312000,,419,5.072463768115942
8434509,5,B004LNWRO4,"I bought this dvd for my husband. Both of us have been to The Keys and this dvd has showed us a good ammount of things to do and see, alot for FREE. In Key west especially it is nice to be able to ""not spend spend spend"". I would highly recommend it to anyone who has been to The Keys or is planning to go. It's also nice to watch it when you feel like going there and just quite can't.",1325462400,4,386,3.7195121951219514
8434510,1,B004LNWRO4,"You have got to be kidding me.  Do not let the product image fool you - this film looks like it was made in 1985.  Do not waste your money like we just did.  We're planning a trip to the Keys in about a month and were hoping to find a quality documentary.  This was laugh-out-loud terrible.  ""And now we're going to go interview this man from this restaurant and he's going to tell us all about their specials.""  ""And now we're going to go to this park and they're going to tell us all about their programs."" ""And now we're going to watch a dolphin paint.""  It wasn't so much the content, but the sheer lack of directorial insight.  Seriously. I'd expect this from a first year film student.  I feel bad leaving such a harsh review, but this is not purchase-worthy.  I cannot believe PBS is showing this stuff...  Don't waste your money.",1320278400,3,837,4.335483870967742
8434511,4,B004LNWRO4,"Grew up in Miami, been to the Keys hundreds of times, never knew much of its rich history and variety of sites to see.  So often, especially in a familiar place, we just don't open our eyes to the interesting little things around us.
Even locals will learn interesting facts and find new places to visit in the Keys.  Use a few of the coupons and the video pays for itself.",1317427200,5,373,4.23943661971831
8434512,5,B004LNWRO4,I really enjoyed the DVD's.  I was comparing places to go.  This video made up my mind.  Key West has a lot to offer.  And for a bargain (coupons and all)!!  Booking my tickets this week.  I know anyone will enjoy and learn from this as I did.,1310256000,5,243,3.9583333333333335
