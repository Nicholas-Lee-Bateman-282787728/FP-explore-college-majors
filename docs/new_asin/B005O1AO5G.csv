I finally received it got all set up to watch it , the DVD would not play it's a European edition and no where in the description does it say that it's European only . You can watch it on a computer but I don't own a computer . I am so upset that I can't play this ..",1366502400,6,352,3.5256410256410255
8480884,5,B005O1AO5G,"I came to Dalida via a Cahine's movie where she appears as Christina (her real name), her former lover and devoted friend.  As they say, I fell in love at first sight and one thing led to another.  I have both this DVD and a a CD of her songs, and believe me, she really comes alive in the former.  Clips of TV shows, singing duets with everybody from Julio Yglesias to Petula Clark, Mireille Matthieu, Sacha Distel, you name it, the most beautiful blonde ever (move over, Marilyn), exquisite voice, and a quality that can only be called ""class"".  And then, you have to reflect on her tragic personal life and end (just like Marilyn).  Jean Paul Sartre said of Billy Holiday that her preserved voice assured her of moving from existence into essence.  Delida is in good company: the essentials.",1355184000,6,794,4.556338028169014
