7830455,5,6302739713,"Saw this movie from AMC and it was better than expected. Takes place in the war-torn Italian cities of World War 2. It gets you into the troops and civilians that had to live through the events in Italy during 1944-45. This movie is about an army demolitions team tasked with finding out how some Germans are getting reinforcements near a shattered, rubble-filled town. The platoon lieutenant is angry they are getting that assignment, as recon should be done by infantry and not a demolition team. There are some good suspenseful moments throughout the move. An orphan boy gets involved early on and he gives a good innocence to the picture. There's also some good house-to-house fighting in the rubble and sewers.  Also some good scenes of tank blowing up things. If you can see in on AMC or find a cheap VHS/DVD, it is worth a look-see.",1292630400,,839,4.668918918918919
