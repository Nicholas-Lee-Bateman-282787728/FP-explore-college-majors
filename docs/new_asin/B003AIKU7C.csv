MANY (but not all) American BluRay players are NOT compatible with 50hz content (50hz is the UK broadcast standard: 60hz is the US standard). SOME players will convert the content to 60hz, SOME will output it in its native format (meaning you'd need a TV compatible with 50hz) and others (like the Playstation 3) CAN'T cope with 50hz content AT ALL!

Check my other reviews (for Being Human BluRays) if you need further info on 50hz compatibility. Otherwise, if you're not sure, you should stick with the American release of the complete boxset.

Don't say you haven't been warned!",1289952000,13,728,4.761904761904762
