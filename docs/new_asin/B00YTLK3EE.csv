7269001,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Saw this DVD and it is well done and deals with family matters that have plagued us  for eons- it just took one Godly father who
planned to spend alittle time with a fatherless boy and how it turned his life around.",1439424000,3,215,4.119047619047619
7269002,3,B00YTLK3EE,enjoyed it,1481587200,,10,4.5
7269003,3,B00YTLK3EE,I usually enjoy movies with Kevin Sorbo.  This was not my cup of tea.  It did have some funny and warm parts in the movie.,1481587200,,122,3.84
7269004,5,B00YTLK3EE,"What can I say???  I loved this cute family movie.  I always love Kevin Sorbo, but I bought it because Mark Collie is in it.  He isn't in the movie very long, but as always, his acting is top notch!  He should have played Johnny Cash in .... ""I Walk The Line"" ...

This is a good clean movie for all..",1475107200,,301,3.8688524590163933
7269005,4,B00YTLK3EE,"Made for family movies are often boring and poorly done. This is a great exception. It has a solid story, a few moments of ""preachy parenting"" but overall, very good story.",1474761600,2,172,4.580645161290323
7269006,4,B00YTLK3EE,"While I'm going to have to rewatch it to figure out how the name of the movie reflected the actual movie other than being the title of his book, I really liked this movie.  Its family friendly.  Its just about men helping a young man who no longer has a father deal with becoming a man.  I liked it...very sweet and very good morals.  Kevin Sorbo is great in anything.  Amy Grant while I love her for her music the most, does a wonderful job as the little boys Mom.  Just a really well done movie.",1474070400,2,497,4.125

7269022,4,B00YTLK3EE,nice movie.  gift to a friend and watched it with her,1453334400,,53,3.8181818181818183
7269023,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Solid story and though clearly not a big budget Hollywood film, it looked like one with great actors. Well worth watching and would make a great gift as nothing offensive, yet not boring like so many G & PG movies. We need more movies like this one!",1450742400,,249,4.319148936170213
7269024,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Sadly, we live in a time when fathers are routinely mocked, scorned and ridiculed in every way possible by the popular media.  Just look at any TV sitcom over the last 20 years and name one dad who hasn't been represented as an ineffectual buffoon.  The Secret Handshake provides a refreshingly different take on the role of fathers, and men in general, as mentors to their own children as well as those in the community.  This is a really nice story that blends an endearing mix of light-hearted humor and emotional depth.  Kevin Sorbo serves up a wonderful portrayal of a man who is far from perfect, yet is willing to step up to the task when placed in a challenging position.  Amy Grant is sensational in her short time on screen.  The rest of the cast is very solid too.  This was clearly a low-budget labor of love by first-time director Howard Klausner, better known for his screenplay credits on such films as ""Space Cowboys"" and ""The Last Ride.""  What this movie may have lacked in resources, it definitely made up for in heart and a very positive message.  Highly recommended for the whole family!",1450656000,,1107,4.607142857142857
7269025,4,B00YTLK3EE,It was a good movie but could have used a more developed story line. Clean family movie.,1450483200,,88,4.235294117647059
7269026,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Super cute, family friendly and some really great lines!",1450396800,,56,5.333333333333333
7269027,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Wow.... What a terrific family friendly movie.
It was so enjoyable to sit down as a family and watch this great movie together !!
We laughed ... We shed a few tears and we all walked away with our hearts smiling. We bought this the day that it came out ... Would make a great gift to anyone and everyone !",1449964800,4,305,4.016393442622951
7269028,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Who knew that Hercules was such a good dad? Seriously, folks, this is truly a heart warming, good old fashioned family movie with a message that is relevant today as it ever was. With kids and parents spending so much time on their small screens, even at home, here is a great reason for the whole family to watch a movie together on their family ""big"" screen. Don't forget the popcorn!",1449705600,3,386,4.450704225352113
7269029,3,B00YTLK3EE,"This movie was a disappointment. The ""humor"" in it was just strange. The midget with the party bus and the half naked guys dancing around the campfire were weird. That coupled with the middle school age kid streaking in his tighty whiteys across the football field made it a movie I wouldn't feel comfortable letting my daughters watch. I was under the impression that this was a Christian movie but there was no Christian message to it at all. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen but I wouldn't recommend it.",1449532800,,516,4.559139784946237
7269030,5,B00YTLK3EE,"I love a good hollywood blockbuster and a weighty drama, but as I get older I increasingly value an edifying movie that my whole family can feel good after seeing. This qualifies perfectly! It's low-budget, but authentically well-crafted, well-acted, and well-written. It will make you laugh and think deeply about what's important as a parent and as a male in our culture. I recommend it highly!",1449532800,5,396,5.015151515151516
7269031,5,B00YTLK3EE,"The Secret Handshake addresses complex themes in a compassionate and often funny light. The movie creates a remarkably sensitive character in the father (Kevin Sorbo) as he struggles with his own frustrations around completing a creative work while working in a mundane job.  Parenting his three young daughters, one of whom is being harassed by a fatherless teen, lands the father in the midst of a crisis. A tense encounter in the woods occurs where the men learn as much or more than the troubled teenager theyve brought with them.  While the themes are serious, they're handled with snappy dialog and interspersed animations. The Secret Handshake delighted my entire family with its surprises and insight.",1449446400,5,709,5.156521739130435
7269032,5,B00YTLK3EE,"This film really captures what resides inside almost all of us... a deep desire to belong, to be loved, to be understood, and to have our wounds soothed. I challenge you to not identify with one of these families or at least one of the characters! It's when we shift our thinking about those people we judge (including the face we see in the mirror every day), that compassion and restoration begin. Our thinking shifts from ""What's wrong with that person?""  to  ""I wonder what happened to that person?"" That's what this film is about... compassion and restoration. This may be the best Christmas present you could buy for your family and for those you care about! And when the Christmas season is over, don't stop there. Compassion and restoration are never out of season... nor is this film!",1449446400,5,793,4.697841726618705
7269033,5,B00YTLK3EE,We loved this film - so good you will want to see it again and again. The story is clever and fun with important life messages throughout! It's a great family movie with no foul language or violence! I give it 5 stars!,1449446400,,218,4.093023255813954

7269035,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Great movie with important messages throughout! Fun, funny, heartwarming and meaningful-what more can you want from a movie? And no bad languarge or violence! A breath of fresh air in a world of shoot 'em up blow 'em up entertainment. Well worth the 90 minute investment and a great stocking stuffer!!",1449360000,,301,4.921568627450981
7269036,5,B00YTLK3EE,"Terrific family film  - and it's not animated (thank goodness!). Our entire family with 3 kids ages 7-17 thouroughly enjoyed this movie. It was clever, funny and edifying - a rare combo these days, sadly. Kevin Sorbo and Amy Grant bring the ""star power,"" but there are plenty of great performances by lesser know actors. I ended up buying the DVD for gifts, adding popcorn and movie candy to create a movie night family gift.",1449360000,,425,4.666666666666667

Loved the music too! Great for boys and dads but my daughter loved it too. Buy, watch and give as a gift. You'll be glad you did!",1449014400,5,289,3.9152542372881354

8719137,3,B00YTLK3EE,Didn't really watch it as I fell asleep which I hope is not an indication of how the movie was.  I don't remember it and when I was able to watch it again the rental was expired.  Oh well...probably won't be renting this again...I usually love anything that Kevin Sorbo is in.,1497484800,,276,4.288461538461538
