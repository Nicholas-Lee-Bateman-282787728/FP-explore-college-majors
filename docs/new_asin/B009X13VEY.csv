8544809,4,B009X13VEY,"I originally watched this show while living in England in 1978-79 and remember it fondly. A group of Cockney thieves, led by Turtle and his henchman, Razor Eddie, rob an armored car, intending to make off with cash, but find instead only a large number of safe deposit boxes. Each week they open a new box to see what they've lucked into this time. Unfortunately, a number of the owners are the boxes are aware of the theft and are decidedly unhappy about the contents falling into our heroes' hands. Turtle and Razor Eddie try to stay a step ahead of both the police and the numerous criminals out to acquire their haul, by any means necessary.

One of the real joys of the show is the theme song: ""Mr. Muggins, this is your lucky day."" You should be able to find it somewhere on the Internet.",1385337600,,794,4.401360544217687
