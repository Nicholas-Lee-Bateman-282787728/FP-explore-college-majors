Good guy, Bryan Genesse, gets taken by a Cuban General who wants to run things and he is delivered to said General by a rogue CIA agent chick, the worst actress ever! named J. Cynthia Brooks, she either is a relative or the casting couch. The General controls him and others with a microchip in the neck. He has to battle back for his identity. CHEESY. Now here we go with my problems besides the very awful J. Cynthia Brooks. Bryan is not great at acting either nor is anyone in this. But I would have thought a good fight between Bryan and Joe Lara would have been great, no such luck. The director felt explosions would make up for a lot of garbage. Guns never run out of bullets, all cliches all the time, bad guys can't shoot at all, miss everything. The dialog is brutally bad. God help me I watched it all. I am not sure what movie these others watched but I saw a total suckfest of a movie.",1497139200,,954,4.134408602150538

8029243,5,B0002MFGBE,"This was THE best movie i saw over the summer...possibly the best ive ever seen. Brian Genese is THE action hero of the new millenia and i wouldnt be surprised to see him in more action thrillers such as this! Roper gives Genese (PARKER FBI!!!!) the best catch phrases, and has a well developed script! Joe Lara (with a hair-cut that gives him a ""Jesus-like"" appearance) is one hell of a villain and a great nemesis to PARKER! Mr. Itai Haber does an excellent job with the musical composures!! I recommend this movie for EVERYONE who wants ACTION!!! If you don't buy it, it truly would be....a BIG MISTAKE! DON'T GET ... AND DONT GO BLOWIN' IT! LIVE WIRE RULES!  :)",1031788800,,665,4.4958677685950414
