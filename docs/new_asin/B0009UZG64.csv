2323801,2,B0009UZG64,"Dennis the Menace (1993) Hank Ketcham's comic strip character is brought to life as the latest attempt by John Hughes to cash in on his own Home Alone series. It's really too bad, because the film is so perfectly cast: Mason Gamble (Spy Hard) is an acceptable Dennis; Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) and Robert Stanton (Bob Roberts) couldn't be more likable as Dennis' parents; and Walter Matthau and Joan Plowright are absolutely perfect as Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. But the film, which starts off well, eventually slides directly into Home Alone territory, especially with the introduction of a thief character (Christopher Lloyd-Back to the Future) whom Dennis trips up in that painful ""Kevin vs Harry and Marv"" way. This one gets sooo painful, in fact, it's nearly unwatchable. Still, the kids are sure to love, so there will probably be a viewing in your future if you're a parent.",1229817600,2,883,4.854304635761589
2323802,5,B0009UZG64,This movie happens to be one of my family's favorites!  We love how Dennis can be so mischievous without even really knowing that he is!  Great family movie,1226880000,,156,4.535714285714286
2323803,4,B0009UZG64,This double feature is worth your buy.  I have 3 kids ranging from 5 - 12yrs and we ALL enjoy these movies - especially the original. Laugh out loud funny:),1221091200,6,156,4.2

2323805,3,B0009UZG64,"The original Dennis the Menace was a pretty good movie. It was funny and I thought the acting was good. The second movie had a whole different set of actors that just did a horrible job. Not only that, but the plot to the second movie just stunk. There wasn't anything really funny or exciting about the second movie either.

I would probably recommend this dvd for the first movie, but definitely not for the second. If you can buy the dvd with just the 1st movie for cheaper, I would recommend you do that.",1192752000,10,508,4.347368421052631

We decided to watch it together so I unwrapped it and put it in the player. It was fine until it got to a certain point in the movie and it froze up. I tried fast forwarding it past that point without success. I stopped it and restarted it and it froze again at the same point. I removed the disk and cleaned it and tried again...without success. It was a brand new, never before used video that doesn't play all the way through. I couldn't even get to the second movie on the disc.",1417564800,3,608,4.117647058823529

The boys absolutely love it and every time they are at my parents house they ask to watch it. I purchased this for my nephew so he could have it at home and figured the second episode was a bonus, for the price you couldn't beat it. My girls like it, I don't know if I would purchase it for them, they have a ton of movies and I don't know if they would care either way but they did enjoy it and would watch it again.",1274486400,2,648,3.7372262773722627
