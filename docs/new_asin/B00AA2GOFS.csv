Berlin Opera Night 2003 Truly a starry Night however you describe it!
5 stars rating

This concert, recorded in late 2003, celebrates the 10th anniversary of the German AIDS foundation and which had just reached 3.5 million euros in fund raising for the charities. This event is the main focal point of the Berlin ball Season each year.

The program is unashamedly aimed at recognised 'crowd pleasers' and the assembled cast features singers that were established favourites or those rapidly becoming so. The Berlin Opera orchestra is led by Kent Nagano fulfilling his dbut performance with the orchestra. The Berlin opera chorus is also included in the final number as well as all the soloists. The recording is of excellent quality with clear camera work, good colour and image definition and with sound presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. Subtitle options are provided.

Angelika Kirchschlager opens proceedings with two finely nuanced and graceful arias for Cherubino from the Marriage of Figaro. This sets a very high standard which is then met, one by one, as each singer then appears with music that is ideal for each. Thus Rene Pape mischievously shines with Don Giovanni's book of conquests, Michele Crider is a dramatic Tosca, Adrianne Pieczonka is a luminous Rusalka and Anne Schwanewilms portrays her deep understanding of feminine emotional commitment that later transferred from this Lohengrin to Der Rosenkavalier.

The final trio from Der Rosenkavalier then follows with an effective performance by Juliane Banse, Adrianne Pieczonka and Angelika Kirchschlager. Salvatore rises to the challenge of Nessun dorma and Grace Bumbry shows just how it should be done even at 66 years with a heartfelt portrayal of Saint Saens' Dalila. Vesselina Kasarova's aria from Werther stands out as transporting us to the opera house and away from this stage. A remarkable performance from a singer with a remarkable voice. Vladimir Galouzine gives us a darkly Russian Pagliacci which underlines the danger lurking below the stage surface. Charles Castonovo brings us back to good humour with his aria from Lehar's Land of Smiles.

The whole concert then ends with a combined finale featuring all the soloists plus opera chorus in 'Bruderlein und Schwesterlein' from Die Fledermaus. This finale has humour as well as a couple of soloists not heard individually on the disc which suggests some abbreviation of the whole concert. No matter, as what we have is a truly memorable feast of music performed memorably.

Even if there are examples where other performances have not been surpassed, Pavarotti and Fleming spring to mind, it would be hard to imagine the consistent quality of this occasion being easily matched, let alone be improved upon.

I would suggest that, if the program appeals and there is no aversion to this type of operatic highlights gala event, then this disc absolutely warrants very serious consideration indeed as a purchase. This disc has now transferred from the TDK to the EuroArts label.

Berlin Opera Night from 2011. Less focussed on the big 'crowd pleasers'
4 stars rating (no surround sound or subtitles)

This opera night from late 2011 features the Berlin Opera orchestra under Donald Runnicles and ten notable soloists. The program avoids the most obvious 'big hits' of some similar events thus giving the singers an opportunity to shine in other repertoire, which they all do without exception.

There is an emphasis on Verdi as the main composer of the evening with no less than five of his operas represented. The Verdi arias are 'Il balen del suo sorriso' (Travatore - Jenis), 'Quando le sere al placido' (Luisa Miller - Demuro), 'Surta e la notte' & 'Tutto sprezzo che d'Ernani (Ernani - Pieczonka), 'O patria mia' (Aida - Lewis) and 'O don fatale' (Don Carlos - Smirnova).

There are also arias by Delibes (Flower Duet from Lakme - Genaux & Kermes), Gounod ('Ah! Leve-toi' from Romeo - Poli) and Puccini ('E lucevan le stelle' from Tosca - Ilincai). The final item is 'Time to say goodbye' by Sartori which features all ten singers led by Simone Kermes and Francesco Demuro.

The ten singers are Simone Kermes, Francesco Demuro, Alex Esposito, Vivaca Genaux, Teodor Ilincai, Dalibor Jenis, Kristin Lewis, Adrianne Pieczonka, Antonio Poli and Anna Smirnova. It would be invidious to single out any of these fine singers for particular praise. It should be sufficient to state simply that they all rise to the occasion for each of their arias and that the arias favour lyrical content rather than virtuosic display. There is a feeling of togetherness rather than any sense of competitiveness which would be less than appropriate for such a concert aimed to support Aids-related charities.

The recording is supplied in good quality stereo and the imaging is obviously in HD which gives excellent definition and colour on all but the farthest shots where contrast is too high to allow clean identification of those on stage as a panoramic view. This should not be emphasised as it constitutes a very small amount of the total viewing time.

Each singer and their aria is identified by sub-headings as they appear and the content of the arias and the context is described in the booklet but there is no option for language subtitles which seems to be a mistake applicable to any viewer not intimately aware of the librettos as they progress. This and the lack of surround sound are the two main reasons for the dropped star rating.

Otherwise this is a very successful concert and should give lots of viewers plenty of enjoyment and satisfaction. I would suggest, therefore, that for anyone interested in these singers and the chosen program, this disc would be worth giving serious consideration.",1359676800,2,5952,5.09025641025641
