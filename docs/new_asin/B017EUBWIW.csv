8738944,5,B017EUBWIW,"Take this DVD out from the restful pastel packaging, pop it in a player, and it explodes with a powerful bluesy ooze that leaves me saying, ""Wow."" I first heard Suzy and Eric's music some years ago when I came across a couple of tracks from Stop & Listen. Those recordings quickly became favorites and, almost a decade later, their music still resonates.

The DVD captures something unique that's hard to describe. It's more than just a string of performances recorded to entertain. It's a fly-on-the-wall chance to watch and hear two life-long musicians sharing heart-felt music with us--and with each other--in a way that never gets old.

Hats off to the Tiki Parlour for giving us this experience!",1480291200,,700,4.873949579831932

8738947,5,B017EUBWIW,"Wow!  Let me say that again...wow!  What do you get when you mix some of the tastiest flat picked guitar with some of the bluesiest soulful fiddle?  This DVD.

A veritable journey through America's musical soul, Eric & Suzy Thompason have been doing this for years...from the Southern Highlands of Appalachia, down the rivers to Memphis and the Delta, and even further still into Cajun Acadiana, this collection of live performances encompasses and explores America's melting pot of folk music.

A flat picking guitar legend who's played with the likes of Jerry Garcia and David Grisman, Eric backs up Suzy's bluesy Memphis and Cajun fiddle, learned firsthand from masters such as Jody Stetcher and Dewey Balfa, and the result is truly magical!

From classic blues tracks to old-time fiddle and beyond...this DVD is a real treat, a must have for anyone interested in music before 1930, untainted real performances that I've literally watched over and over again...and you will too!

If you like your fiddle funky and your guitar chunky, you're gonna want to pick this up...trust me on this.",1471996800,,1090,5.022222222222222
8738948,5,B017EUBWIW,"These two are legendary performers. So talented. They give a great performance on this DVD with so much variety, and I always love the signature red couch of the Tiki Parlour in the background! Well done. It's so important to record and preserve these musicians.",1459987200,,262,4.844444444444444
8738949,5,B017EUBWIW,"Simply one of the greatest old-time music duos alive! Eric and Suzy have the pedigree and the power of ten master duos. Suzy is without a doubt the greatest living blues singer and fiddle player alive. Eric is truly a wizard of the strings. Although they can do anything, their real source of musical power is in their infectious rhythms, ancient sounding blues and old-school feel. Their music gets down and dirty without any pretense or unneccessary noodling. Thank God for that. They are the real thing.",1459641600,,506,4.827586206896552
