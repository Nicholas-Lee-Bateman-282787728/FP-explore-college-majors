5062758,1,B0077QPPGO,"This is possibly the worst documentary I've ever seen on any subject. They spend the first 5 or 10 minutes interviewing people that ""claimed"" to be happy wind mills were coming to the area then they all go into panic attacks at the thought of wind mills in their area. Several of them moaned and wailed about after they researched them they changed their minds but not one of them said what changed them. One person went to see one and started off saying yeah the sound wasn't that bad then they started moaning that the sound would be for the rest of their lives! They tried to scare the audience by saying how it's a major construction project and that one single windmill was the same as having several factories in an area, one windmill! They mention oil spills as being a hazard. Oil spills???? They have a crank case just like a truck they aren't the Exon Valdez!!!! They provide few facts other than they are an eyesore and make a sound. Ever drive past a coal fired plant? I've driven through the massive wind farm east of LA and it doesn't make much sound and we're talking hundreds of wind towers in a small area. The film is pure propaganda meant to scare you. My God they try to scare you with the ""shadow flicker"". I've never even heard the term before. One guy says the shadow flicker has driven people crazy. FYI they were talking about shadow flicker on roads upsetting drivers yet oddly enough the wind mills in their area were supposed to be on top of a hill no where near a road. I swear their arguments are so silly it boarders on being a comedy. They stop just short of saying they cause cancer. The joke is the big three are usually, eyesore, sound and bird strikes but these 400' towers are so tall few birds fly that high. I love the one claiming the wind mill was causing her insomnia. They look out her window and it must be at least half a mile away if not further. She could barely see it and how could she hear it? A dog couldn't hear it at that distance! Ultimately their main issue was they are an eyesore. Some of them slip up and hint that one of the reasons they are against them is they personally weren't making money off them. One guy claims he is an environmentalist then uses the NIMBY excuse, Not In My Back Yard. My guess is this ""documentary"" was funded by oil and coal companies. It's pure anti-renewable propaganda with few hard facts just lots of people trying to tell you how scary wind mills are.",1341792000,3,2443,4.336244541484716
5062759,5,B0077QPPGO,"This is a bone chilling expose on how the industrial wind subsidiaries of the petro chemical industry exploit state and federal subsidies for wind power by preying on rural communities.  The tactics documented in this film parallel what is documented in ""Gas Land"" and every rural community with natural elevation is at risk of these carpet bagger , traveling salesman  pitches and manipulations.

The good citizens in Dutchess County NY  like the good citizens who leased their land to natural gas frackers thought they were doing a good thing for humanity, for planet earth and had no idea what they were in for, what they became trapped in.  This victimazation of individuals often begins with a careful cultivatiion of a relationship with the local selectmen or head of town council, thus preventing or at least frustrating any effforts to put landuse regulation in place in hime to head off the swift and powerful takeover of entire towns.

We see this played out in Maine every day..the exact story of this film.

""Windfall"" should be in every town library in every rural town.  It should be shown by community associations and civic groups with talk backs and discussion groups afterward. I think this film could be a powerful awakening for rural communities to be forewarned and forearmed with sound land use regulations and for indoviduals to recogize the tactics of predatory exploitative corporate practices.

I like the format and style of the film which allows each voice to be the authentic, ""from experience"" voice of the people victimized by industrial wind interests and misled by their own town selectmen. There is no narrative or anaylsys super imposed on these authentic and separate narratives which gives us the viewers a direct encounter with what happened and room to draw our own conclusions.",1340496000,8,1817,5.03
5062760,1,B0077QPPGO,"This ""documentary"" is set in upstate New York, where a bunch of greedy people decided they could live in a community with windmills.  The whole premise of this movie is flawed as the director claims wind energy is bad.  A Four hundred foot windmill in your backyard is bad, stupidity is bad, greed is bad. But Wind energy is not bad. This ""Documentary"" almost seems as if it were funded by soemone whom might have an interest in scaring people off of wind and solar energy...

5062761,5,B0077QPPGO,"The documentary film Windfall focuses on two small upstate New York towns, but what takes place there could and is taking place all over America as communities suddenly wake up to the realization that industrial wind already has a plan for nearby development.  By then, it is often too late for ordinary citizens to educate themselves about the economic, social, and environmental impacts that a feasibility study might reveal.  Windfall shows this process of discovery as citizens and local government leaders struggle to come together when they realize that proven facts about industrial wind's efficacy are often not available.  Windfall is a must-see film for anyone who considers themselves to be ""green"" or an environmentalist.",1335916800,11,733,5.356521739130435

5062763,5,B0077QPPGO,"This movie reveals the corruption behind the wind industry in America today.  The wind industry fails to explain why after 20 years they still need billions in federal tax-payer subsidies and therefore increases our federal deficit in order to pay for the million dollar salaries of the wind industry executives. They build massive wind farms in rural areas of Maine and other areas of rural America simply because by doing so they will receive the massive tax subsidies paid for by the American people, not because it will be energy efficient.  This movie exposes the corruption that the wind industry has done to the American people. It falsely claims to reduce green house gases. Every environmentalist should see this movie and educate themselves to the truth behind this environmentally destructive and corrupt industry.",1335398400,12,825,5.195488721804511
5062764,5,B0077QPPGO,"This film is a must see for anyone who is concerned about our environment and what happens to communities when wind developers show up  to capitalize on the tax dollars available for wind energy. The music is great and the entire film flows very well.  The film is very balanced and does a good job documenting the process of what occurs in all small towns these developers target.  Wind energy sounds so harmless, until you look at all of the effects on the people and wildlife near these turbines.",1335398400,4,499,4.584269662921348
5062765,5,B0077QPPGO,"If you believe that we all have a responsibility to be good stewards of the environment and educated consumers of energy, there's a pretty good chance you believe wind power is a win-win proposition.  Like a lot of ideas that float along on a cushion of conventional wisdom, though, wind energy development has some significant shortcomings that you'll miss if you're not looking - or simply don't want to see or hear about them.

Laura Israel's documentary, WINDFALL, is a good introduction to what you might be missing if you're a supporter of this energy idea, but don't really know much about it.  Around the world, grid-scale wind turbines - which can reach heights equal to 50-story buildings - have run into problems when erected and operated in close proximity to people's homes and property.  WINDFALL is the story of an effort by residents of one New York town to educate themselves and use that knowledge to protect themselves from an unwanted industrial intrusion.  It's not a film about NIMBYism, it's a film about people working together in an act of self-determination.

This beautifully filmed documentary also gives a good rundown of some of wind energy's dirty little secrets, about which the wind industry doesn't like to talk.  Indeed, the American Wind Energy Association - an industry lobbying group - is already deploying spokespeople to try and discredit the film, a sign that they've been stung by the revealing look Laura Israel has provided.  The U.S. taxpayers are spending a great deal of money to support this industry, so it behooves us all to learn what is being done with our money and, in some cases, to whom it is being done.

I highly recommend WINDFALL.  For those whose communities are facing a similar fate with industrial scale wind turbine development, it's a must see.  Watch it and be your own judge.",1330905600,20,1843,4.875
5062766,3,B0077QPPGO,"First, about the presentation: While most of the production values were good, the interviews were presented in rapid-fire fashion, with video and audio so disjointed that it's hard to think clearly about any of it. I find this very annoying in a Wal-Mart ad, but orders of magnitude worse in a video of this type.

Like numerous other reviewers, I found the neighbor-vs-neighbor aspect of this overblown, and ultimately boring. I couldn't even keep straight who was on which side, and eventually stopped caring.

All in all, there was considerable food for thought. Yes, I can see how the noise, vibration, and moving shadows could drive someone crazy. Fires and ice throws are not trivial concerns. Safe conclusions: (1) the company is looking out for their interests, not yours, (2) you need to know what you're getting into, (3) the effects for those across town may be very different from what impacts you, (4) maybe wind farms shouldn't be close to people, in general.

The last point, especially, could've used some analysis. To alleviate the problems of wind farms, you may want to site them a few miles from any population. A few miles, but not hundreds of miles. That means that the costs, and power losses, of transmission lines are not necessarily a show-stopper, especially if you decide to incorporate much storage. Wind, like anything else, needs to be done right.

Which brings me to the last point: A whole littany of objections to wind power is thrown in during the final moments, without any attempt to analyze the finer points, or consider possible rebuttals or more nuanced options. I find this approach objectionable. You're apparently supposed to be overwhelmed by the problems with wind power, but not supposed to think about it too deeply. The only solution that seemed to be embraced without reservation was energy efficiency--but there, too, there is an upside and a downside to relying on that--none of which was considered.",1387756800,,1951,4.975460122699387
5062767,3,B0077QPPGO,"While I am pro wind, The video brings up a lot of valid concerns. However, this is more pointed to the social dynamic of the internal struggle among the townspeople reacting to a major development, not so much about actual wind turbines. This happens when any major development tries to move into a town. I've see much more serious struggles when Walmart tries to move in threatening local shop owners business.  I can debate their few ""physical"" concerns for days and in that, I would suggest letting 3 other videos about the very real environmental devastation, personal economic loss, and very serious health issues encountered by people effected by Fracking for natural gas and mining for the silica they use in Fracking. Watch Gaslands, Gaslands 2 and The Price of Sand, all offered by Amazon, and compare the pro's and Con's  of who you would want doing business in your community. Overall, I would give this a 3 out of 5 because the apples are not compared to apples unless you compare it to fossil fuel extraction.",1378771200,,1022,4.768361581920904
5062768,5,B0077QPPGO,"This documentary presented both sides of the debate over wind power, although it was clear it was anti-wind.

5062769,1,B0077QPPGO,"I got this movie with high hopes, but it was so one sided it just sounded like a hit piece. In the end about 2/3 of the way through I just had to turn it off. Sorely disappointing would be my review.  I am still looking for a good, well rounded video about wind power.

5062770,3,B0077QPPGO,"This film gets points on its camerawork, and editing. Although those elements being strong generally add to the overall film, in documentaries, it's way more important that the content is highly insightful and educational than having 90 minutes of just eye-candy (the film Low & Clear comes to mind of such eye-candy).  The audio in the film gives it a very nice feel.

I would say this film's makeup is similar to that of Gas Land and The Last Mountain, however it falls off after about 40 minutes and turns into a country neighbor vs. country neighbor battle royal.  It almost was too local in that these people's experiences could not be applicable to my own or to those in my region.

I come away with this a tad bit more aware of the whole green (greed) energy corporate hustle, but I don't come away excited or fired up about learning more like how  a film like The Cove or Blue Gold did for me.",1369440000,,901,4.4363636363636365
5062771,5,B0077QPPGO,This film is a great insight to a serious situation. It is an account of small town life and how big business can corrupt the peace and serenity that is found in communities  through out our nation. Definitely not a stuffy documentary but one that features real people and the struggle to educate the public about a serious situation we face in rural America,1369267200,,358,4.59375
5062772,5,B0077QPPGO,"This town could have been our county one year ago.  The same type of comments, the same attitudes.  I'm not sure what I expected from the movie, but it easily held my interest.  It was factual and not beating me over the head one way or another about the wind issue. This is a must watch for anyone who is curious about the wind issue or who is in an area where wind projects are being proposed.  Trust me this is a true picture of what happens in a community.  Great, movie that will hold your interest!",1368144000,,504,4.154639175257732
5062773,2,B0077QPPGO,"Wrong. There are no facts or figures presented in this film at least, not any that can be followed. This is either because the film makers couldn't be bothered to do any research or because these facts simply do not exist. Some of the concerns raised by the town are legitimate (setbacks, ice throw) but, answers are never given. Do not look to this film for legitimate information.

P.S. Anyone who thinks that the wind business is going to be less sleazy than any other business is extremely nave and should never sign away land rights without counsel.",1367625600,2,554,4.653061224489796
5062774,5,B0077QPPGO,"There is a huge surge in wind power development happening right now. With wind being a diffuse source of power, this means there is going to be a lot of back yards for those with NIMBY objections. This movie does an excellent job of cataloging the downsides that neighbors have to deal with. It gives us a great cinematic view of these huge 400 foot structures. We can hear the rhythmic sounds the blades make as they pass the support towers and hear that it's louder when it rains. We can see the shadow flicker and how difficult it is to deal with a fire that is hundreds of feet up in the air. The wind companies fit the stereotype of the greedy corporation.

While this movie does have a point of view, it would be a real stretch to call it anti-wind propaganda. Most of the objections I have to wind power are beyond its scope. It's expensive, subsidized, intermittent power that must be backed up with the fossil fuel power that it is intended to replace. It also makes this backup power less efficient. For lower carbon emissions, gas and nuclear make more sense.",1366416000,2,1070,4.459183673469388

5062777,2,B0077QPPGO,"I watched Windfall knowing that, like all documentaries, it would likely be a bit ""one-sided"". To be fair, I was certain it would be on the ""wrong-side"" given my familiarity with wind project tensions that have appeared in my home state. But I still couldn't wait for the possible drama to unfold, and hoped it may have a deep view as to why some communities refuse to host clean energy (while so many other places embrace it).

What I found informative were the bits focused mainly on how the town of Meredith was unprepared to write zoning laws that helped 'manage' the impact of wind turbines entering the area - and how the town had to really scramble to figure them out. In a race to sort out the details, a great deal of hilarious 'research' is revealed by different town members pointing to the 'adverse impacts' of the large machines. I suppose that the activity was a good sign that democracy is alive and well in Meredith, NY, which wasn't about to let a wind project touch ground without hearing from everyone first. Generally speaking, the key issue appeared to be that a handful of neighbors would be living near the project site, while but one or two would gain actual monetary benefits from them via land leases. Neighbors find themselves scrambling to do what they can to prevent the money from flowing in the wrong direction. Ultimately, the town planner sought to place restrictions in the form of set backs that would have made it impossible to place the machines anywhere in Meredith. Problem solved? No, since the town board also had its say. Political corruption is suggested, but not proven. No discussion is made as to how Meredith could have opted for small-scale wind power, or community-owned wind power.

Accompanying the drama is the interesting tale of neighborly jealously / greed. On the one hand, none of the protagonists seem particularly poor - they all seem to own homes, farms, or large tracts of land. On the other hand, the area is collectively described as poor. Hence the wind project developers are described as powerful, shadowy forces that can easily stomp all over the people of Meredith. But many of the town members we meet are high-powered professionals themselves - former surgeons from NY, Times Magazine managers, or academic journal/encyclopedia editors, for example. All seem to be enjoying an early retirement or something. According to the US census, Delaware county is host to 47 thousand people of middle age, mostly white homeowners, about a 1/5 college educated. The typically home value is far below the US median, but median income is about 44 thousand compared to 53 thousand nationally (57 thousand for NY). If that is ""poor"", they should come try to make it in my state, where income is lower and housing costs higher.

Yet it is the large dairy farmer that is most interested in adding lease income to his farm by hosting turbines (a seemingly good idea since the dairy industry is waning in the town). Other neighbors are eventually offered 'hush money' of about $500 dollars - a practice that would bar them from complaining about the project after its completion. Some must've refused it, otherwise I assume their roles in the film would have been incriminating. The film doesn't say much about the actual monetary benefits of the project, its cost, or the benefits it may bring to the town ('to maintain the roads', they say) - we just get a hint that use of the land would be worth ""$5000"" (annually? Monthly?). It focuses instead on 'accelerated depreciation' benefits written into the tax code, that can be transferred to other companies, and mentions other tax credits that make the taxpayer important to the wind industry as it seeks to 'ruin and divide' communities. A question not answered is, is such 'portfolio trading' occurring in other industries? Is it bad? Industry comments would have been helpful here, especially given that many project finance schemes DO involve ownership 'flipping'. Essentially, project developers 'give ownership' to a bank or Google or something. The owners given the developer 'tax equity finance' in exchange for the tax credits, which helps finance the project. After about 10 years ownership 'flips' back to the original developer, who collects all revenue and so on. The scheme sounds worse than it is, and it wouldn't be convoluted if banks were willing to make ordinary loans to power projects (energy projects are too 'risky', so the tax credits offset the risk).

There is no contact with actual wind developers in the film, nor any attempt to contact state officials or real experts on wind energy / projects, which takes away from much of the dramatic tension. You may get interested in the landowners struggle, for example, but are left trying to pick out the most villainous neighbor. T Boone Pickens, the infamous Wind and Natural Gas developer is given as a typecast for the industry, which, during congressional hearings, reveals the 'master plan' to saturate the grid with wind power and transmission lines. Additionally, Pickens' has been developing mainly in the west, in Texas, while the people of NY were dealing with a company called Airtricity of Ireland. The film never attempts to describe how the practices, attitude, or approach of Airtricity may reflect business practices in Ireland being a poor match for U.S. citizens, for example. In fact, Airtricity is a huge global power company. In their FY 2012 report, Airtricity has about 10 million customers and generates billions in revenues. It maintains only 1,300 MWs of wind power currently however, making it a relatively small part of their business. Why not look at a smaller, dedicated wind company to see if practices are any different? But I digress.

Given the neighbors relative powerlessness and fear that they will not make any real money from the project, but be forced to live near it, they resort ultimately to their 'research' which typifies wind turbines as a cause of some specific health and environmental problems as well as economic loss in the form of taxpayer subsidy flowing to the benefit of large investment banks/greedy people like Pickens. The neighbors actually go so far as to question whether turbines are actually 'net positive' electricity producers (given that they consume some amount of energy in their operation), and claim that wind power has to be complimented with lots of base load generators to work right (making their impact on CO2 questionable). These claims are not supported by available facts, which would disagree with such assertions. Yet untangling all of the various issues raised would probably take years of delay and cost - and that is probably the point.

A more well-rounded approach to story telling would have admitted that 'hush money' is not unique to wind power but used by other industries. It would have also admitted that bird/bat impacts have been shown to be much less with wind turbines than domestic cats for instance. Aesthetic issues are a genuine concern, as is noise, but their 'health impact' is unfounded. Focusing on how 'money' divided the town would have been more entertaining (in my view). In my own hometown, 'cell phone towers' provoked a lot of the same bitter neighbor battles in the 1990s. Rather than allow the man on the hill to host it (and make about $1,000/month), the town somewhat underhandedly denied that person the right to host the tower, and then stuck it on public land behind the firehouse.

While I sympathize with those seeking to isolate themselves against the changes that economic development engenders, the film misses an opportunity to discuss how community ownership, and community benefits could be created by wind projects given changes in U.S. policy and the finance of wind projects. It does not have to unfold the way it does - but it unfolds given the U.S.'s general backwardness on policy support for wind power. Community ownership can provide a clearer benefit to a town (as opposed to an individual(s)), yet there will always be someone living closest to the project. The film was a missed opportunity to explore the possibilities. There are web resources for looking at the various permitting / siting laws that states and towns have outlined specifically for wind projects. By far, ownership and set backs remain perhaps the key issues faced by each town. Otherwise, 'Windfall' is a re-hash of NIMBY spirit based on arguments which, to my knowledge, have been made since the 1980s (when the first wind projects were being built). Rather than seek positive solutions, the community tries to kick development to the next town while destroying already thin-felt relationships. It is a surprisingly boring and goofy drama, despite its attempts to drum up a sense of urgency.

As a source of information, I give Windfall a D
As a source of entertainment, I give Windfall a D+
As a Documentary, I give Windfall a C (overall nicely edited and cleanly presented - but other reviewers raise point that director is also a landowner in Meredith)

In my opinion, the best anti-energy documentary I've seen is still Gasland (set up like a detective mystery). But if you really hope to learn a lot about the wind industry, there are many books that provide a more balanced and therefore interesting perspective. With 3 decades under its belt, the impact of wind power in the U.S. is a much more 3-dimensional than described in this film.",1363824000,5,9427,4.935097668557026

5062779,5,B0077QPPGO,"A perfect way to spend a cold Minnesota winter day is watching this excellent documentary on the town of Meredith New York, and their peaceful protest.  I was a wind power supporter, and after viewing this documentary, I remain a supporter, but am now far more educated and enlightened. This is truly a must-see for green power believers - not to turn you against the prospect of green energy, but to be forewarned of the tactics that can be employed to bring wind power to a neighborhood / community like yours.

You'll see that only in America (and elsewhere I'm sure), can we manage to take something ""green"" and turn it into ""greed"".  The documentary shares how Wall Street, Big Banks / Big Money get completely destroy such a great initiative.  It's never enough to do something for good and fair profits, this is all about (as the documentary states) following the money trail.  Truly, I have always been a voice for wind / alternative energy, and remain so. I was at first skeptical, thinking this would be an attack on green, but instead, it is an eye-opening story.  As a Nation, we can learn from this film.  We can learn there is a right way, and a wrong way to go about finding - and funding wind power.

One part that truly stood out is the effects windmills placed too close to homes can have on the homeowners, most notably (as shown) the shadowy reflections inside their homes.  If nothing else, watch this part and see what a home (your home) could look like if a windmill were placed between it and the rays of sun that enter your home.  My view has been changed forever, but not against wind power.  This is something we can do, and do right, to the benefit of our world, and in the case of Meredith - once rich in farming - and now a poor community in America.

For those with a closed mind, you'll probably see this as a one-sided documentary. But if you open your mind, you will learn and become far more educated about battles that will come to other communities, including maybe your own.  In telling a friend about the program, he quickly pointed out that it is the towns fault for signing on the dotted line without understanding the consequences.  While this absolutely may be true in this or other cases, the fact of the matter is, that's exactly what the developers intend to do - take advantage of people.  You'll see the facts in Windfall, so take time to watch this important film.",1357430400,3,2413,4.489702517162471

5062781,5,B0077QPPGO,"You know, it's funny how arguments develop among Americans.  We are certainly an entrepreneurial people, and so our conversations are so often full of tricks meant to hide underlying pecuniary conflicts of interests.
Reading the two one-star reviews, I am reminded of the tobacco companies' reaction to the scientific data of anti-cigarettes campaigns: these corporate interests decided never to deny the cancer-causing effects of cigarettes, rtaher merely to suggest that there ""might"" be ""some doubt"" about the ""absolute"" verity of the research conclusions.  The idea here was merely to ""obfuscate"" things--a great word indicating that one tries to oppose by merely seeking to muddle up the capacity of conversations to lead to conclusions.

  The two one-star raters are doing just that.  They manage to miss the whole point, after making bold claims regarding their true-blue environmentalist credentials.  The point of the film was less about wind power technology than about the wind power BUSINESS PRACTICES that would get this technology in place.  As one person in the film from another town that had gotten swamped with those things says: Once they've built the infrastructure, it costs them little to keep adding more.  And they sure did, putting almost 200 of those things in place where it all started with just 20.  We are also informed that, for a 3 million dollars per tower, one third would be paid by the federal government, and one third by the state.  This involves huge profits which will go, in some significant part, to the coffers of a political party that then goes around complaining about big government (and whose vice-presidential candidate went through college on his deceased father's social security benefits--benefits which his party wants to abolish for the rest of us).

  The issue of the film is about the unhinging of democracy.  Democracy is based on conversation.  Yet the guys behind these deals that will permit them to build hugely remunerative (pretty much for them ONLY!!) towers desperately try to make people sign silence contracts.  What are they trying to hide?--the film asks, and to an initial extent begins quite effectively to explore.

  To me, at least, that's what the film is REALLY about: how the 1% do it to the 99%!!!!!!  What happens in this film is a lot simpler than the mass of off-the-point issues with which these low reviewers try to distract us: what actually happens in this film is that the attempt to stifle communal conversation is successfully hindered through democratic processes, and people's choices are preserved so they can maintain their freedom as well as independence of thought, and come back to their genuine interest in saving the planet another day.  In short, the little town of Meredith was not bamboozled by the 1%!!!!!  THAT'S WHAT THE FILM IS R-E-A-L-L-Y  about!!!!!

  On the Bill Moyers show on public television (a democratic conversation-maker which, incidentally, that political party I mentioned earlier also wants to get rid of) a fascinating film was featured seeking to illustrate Donald Trump's presumably trying to do just this sort of thing in a small seaside town in Scotland--and supposedly succeeding to build his ecologically disasterous and deliberately view-destroying golf course because the same alignment of sober local forces as occurred in Meredith could NOT be put together (a higher level legislature, more responsive to big money, supposedly over-ruled local decision-makers).  Asked at a legislative hearing what criteria he has for his claims, Trump is supposed to have said that HE is the criteria!!!  Now, that's why I call bold 1% thinking--and I shutter at its big-monied impact on democracy!

  Buy the movie (after seeing it on Netfix, I have): it will do your democratic constructive conversationalist heart good!!!!",1345248000,8,3842,5.196747967479674

I watched this in full, which meant to me that it was not only interesting, but wasn't looking to ""pound"" anyone.  After watching the movie, I looked on amazon to see the reviews, and there are complaints about it being one-sided.  This made me reconsider my original opinion, so yes, it may be somewhat one-sided, but personally I like that they portrayed the opponents as regular people, who in many cases were following their own conscience.  Two people can follow their conscience and still disagree.  Regardless, I learned a lot and am grateful for the knowledge.",1344038400,5,636,4.851851851851852
5062784,4,B0077QPPGO,"This informative video shows community concerns about allowing industrial wind farms into a rural American town.  A few community members raised objections to having nearby electricity-generating wind turbines, and the whole town of Meredith became polarized over new local laws related to wind energy or more simply whether or not commercial wind farms can operate within a town's borders and under what conditions.  Although some facts and figures are presented about the planned wind turbines, no alternative engineering solutions are shown that might mitigate community concerns, as the community was presented with the main choice of either obtaining or banning energy from the wind.

An industrial wind turbine is defined in this video as being approximately 400 feet high.  There is a base, lower middle, upper middle and top section, all of which looks like a massive pole holding aloft three, straight, seven-ton blades radiating from the top of the pole, opposite to a small bulge that contains the electricity generator.  The film maker lets people describe in their own words various possible health problems related to living too close to wind turbines, starting with interrupted sleep.  A low frequency vibration and noise emanates from the system and moisture in the air increases the noise level.  The shadow from the spinning blades creates a repetitive effect that can be disturbing for people living in the changing on-off light conditions, and this `shadow flicker' could detract from the overall beauty of a property from the perspective of potential home buyers.  In winter, ice can be thrown from the spinning blades.  Changes in air pressure around wind turbines are also being blamed for the wholesale death of many bats, but the subject is not followed up with a sufficiently in-depth explanation.  The composites in the blades will burn if somehow they catch on fire, and other destructive accidents could happen, which is why such windmills are generally placed one and a half times their height away from another property boundary or residence.  This distance is referred to as a setback, and the amount of offset that must be allowed would control where these devices could be erected.  A setback of one mile would alleviate most community concerns.

Any wind-to-electricity design is presented as having inherent structural flaws, because the intermittent nature of wind prevents the complete replacement of fossil fuels and creates the need for a larger power grid network to distribute intermittent power from remote regions.  Although changing technology is mentioned, one is left with the impression only one wind turbine design is available at present for commercial deployment, and once a few wind turbines are deployed, the infrastructure installed will readily support more turbines until the wind farm site is abandoned.

Could communities feasibly and profitably engage in wind turbine projects and would such communities decide upon the same design?  Given a world full of engineers and companies, one would expect that one design would provide a superior cost/benefit, however, there appears to be a shroud of secrecy over profitability.  Energy companies offer secret contracts to large land owners, who may happen to be on the local town board, for the right to operate wind turbines; receive Federal tax and State incentives only available to large projects; can sell the wind farm after the equipment has been depreciated to zero; and the wind farm will consume electricity when idle.  How much of the government incentives go towards making a better product either in the present or future?  Are the real profits sufficient to make this current approach to a renewable energy future sustainable?

The viewer is left to ponder such things as the best use of government funding, or what forces would prevent experimentation with different engineering approaches, such as turning the blades into cylinders so as not to generate shadow flicker, upturning the tip of the blade in an attempt to stabilize the air currents ... or exactly how changes in air pressure can cause bat lungs to explode.  The pervasive `negative vibrations' cast a shadow that may prevent people from seeing any opportunity for improvement, and the limited engineering explanations lead me to drop one star from my rating.",1343779200,2,4340,5.251808972503618
5062785,1,B0077QPPGO,"I am pro-environmentalist and support various environmental causes to preserve land, conserve energy, etc. I approached this documentary with interest because I was curious to know more about the potential downsides to windpower, such as its effect on birds. Director Laura Israel wraps her story around a good premise, i.e., the potential for wind turbines in the small town of Meredith, N.Y., divides the townspeople and the town government. However, what she does with the topic is both irritating and laughable. The documentary is irritating because it's propaganda. A good documentary presents a balanced approach, talking to both sides of the issue. She does talk to people on both sides of the issue in the town, but she relies on the anti-windpower people in the town to make anecdotal statements without any basis in fact. As one example, the people talk about the problem caused by wind turbine noise. I first encountered wind turbines at Jiminy Peak in Massachusetts as I bicycled on the road at the base of the ridge. I could see the turbines, but I heard nothing. The message she hammers home about every minute is that wind turbines are bad and they will destroy your town. At no point does she present any spokesperson from the wind company to explain their position. The documentary becomes laughable because she keeps overstating more and more concerns along the lines of, if you think wind turbines are bad, I have something even worse to tell you about them. In an interview with Laural Israel, she mentions that she owns a small cabin in Meredith, which is how this topic came to her attention. In the interest of full disclosure, this should be told right up front to the viewers, as this local interest casts a serious bias on her telling of the story. What's the alternative to these evil wind turbines? The documentary has local people talking about homegrown power, but offers no practical solution about what that might mean. She does raise some valid issues relating to tax benefits and writeoffs, the need for extensive powerlines to distribute the electricity, and the effect on bats, but her message is lost on me with her gross overstatement of concerns. I simply cannot recommend this documentary.",1343606400,6,2229,4.930851063829787

8512136,1,B0077QPPGO,"I went into this film with an open mind. I always hear endorsements for wind power and vague oppositions against it, so I wanted more info on the negative side of wind power. Basically, this film documents a few people from one community who portray themselves as environmentally-conscious but refused to make personal sacrifices (enduring wooshing noises and seeing wind turbines and their shadows every day) to help the world. They mention a few other things, like how the turbines require a lot of cement to keep them in the ground and that multiple wind companies were prospecting the region, but these don't hold up and are just mentioned to support their own selfish concerns.

The movie is extremely padded with impertinent segments talking about the history of the town; residents; cows; and long musical segments with old photos, probably because they didn't have sufficient detracting evidence for a feature-length documentary. I used to live near where this was filmed and I used to wonder why none of the communities took advantage of the strong winds. Now I know it's because of selfish, pseudo-environmentalists. I'd absolutely love and be proud to have a wind turbine on my property.

A few other random thoughts:
The turbines caused the residents to have tinitis and heart palpitations... No comment.

One resident claimed that because she felt negatively impacted by the turbines, the rest of the community didn't care about her. The way I see it the opposing residents don't care about the rest of the community.",1398211200,,1530,5.0395256916996045

The film makers did not start with any bias, but came to realize how awful are the machinations of wind energy companies and their supporters.  No county official should ever have to face these people, and only later do they realize just how big a mistake they made by letting them in.  The amount of power they generate is not worth the destruction in the quality of life they cause people living near them.

8512138,4,B0077QPPGO,"I actually work for a wind company with a substantial amount of wind farms throughout the country. I felt compelled to watch this documentary having heard about the turmoil and resistance the erection of wind sites has triggered in various communities.  I thought it paramount not to simply embrace the industry mindset..better to engage in a meaningful, thoughtful inquiry by watching this film.

Prior to this film, my perspective was pretty black and white..that WIND is GOOD, and that the 'nimby's' (the 'not in my backyard' folks) who complained about the ill-effects of wind turbines in their midst were prone to exaggeration and hyperbole regarding problems.  I think this is probably the mindset that is prevalent for most of us that work in the wind industry.  My thought had been that any issues that exist with wind turbines pale greatly in comparison to the detriment posed by fracking or oil spills like the BP disaster in the Gulf.

The film has given me great pause, and reasons to feel uneasy, discomfort with the industry that is my livelihood.

I cannot easily dismiss accounts of sleeplessness, ringing in the ears, heart palpitation - various physical ills - especially when the filmmakers in the documentary's extras speak to experiencing such problems after only 5 days of filming around the large wind farm in Tug Hill.

Frankly, the film has made me wish that wind farms were only built in remote areas and away from townships and communities. Ultimately, though, wind developers will go where the wind corridors are best.

I don't take umbrage - as some have in their reviews - that too much time was spent on the opposing sides and rifts created in the town of Meredith over whether to allow the erection of wind sites.  It was entertaining to hear the various opinions and observations, and for me, it was encouraging that many were making the strides to educate themselves.

It was also an education for me to have these eyes opened to the experiences of those who have been courted to avail lands for wind farms as well as those who already have them in their community.

One of the 'voices' in Meredith who was for the wind farm pondered why the developers hadn't been present or more proactive in their proceedings; I think with any corporation culture faced with a contentious situation,  the choices around whether a communication should be issued and if so, how that 'message' is phrased occurs under the direction and under the reins of the public relations area.

This documentary is definitely worth seeing.",1388534400,2,2544,4.874709976798144
