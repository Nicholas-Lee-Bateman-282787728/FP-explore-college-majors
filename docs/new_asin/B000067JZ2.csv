7963543,5,B000067JZ2,"I am sorry that Tony didn't know what this was when he bought it. Clay Jenkinson does several characterizations in a style of presentation known as Chatauqua, in which the person presents himself as a character from history and speaks as that character. This style of theater was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries around Chatauqua Lake, a resort area in New York.

Jenkinson also takes questions from the audience, still in character, and then engages in a further discussion with the audience after breaking character.

J. Robert Oppenheimer is only one of several characters which Jenkinson does. Others include Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Meriwether Lewis. I have seen him in person several times, and his knowledge of the characters can only be described as encyclopedic.

Anyone wishing to get a more ""human"" understanding of any of these characters than what is presented in many biographies will not be disappointed.

Tony's confusion would not have occurred if a writeup on the video had accompanied the entry in the first place. He was obviously looking for a documentary and didn't find it.",1150848000,,1129,5.0864864864864865
7963544,1,B000067JZ2,"I bought this video expecting a documentary on Oppenheimer's security problems and was surprised to discover that it was a monologue by an actor pretending to be Oppenheimer, speaking, as though resurrected, to this generation.  Since he spoke of whether Osama Bin Laden could get a nuke, the video was made recently.  Since I was expecting something else, I found the whole thing disappointing.
I don't know how much of the views expressed were really Oppenheimer's, or how many were the actor's.  I found comments like ""The only rational people I knew were Communists"" rather surprising.  I think that if Oppenheimer had actually said that, his crucifixion would have been even more severe than it was, given the sentiment of the post war era.  Oppenheimer is depicted as an unrepentant leftist, even though the character would have known the fate of communism (since he knew about 9/11 in this fictional treatment).  He is also depicted as a somewhat vague dreamer who advocates some kind of undefined collaboration with the Soviets and believes that we are going to have to change human nature in some undefined way, in order to avoid annihilation.  As an historical comment, I would like to point out that, although the left would be loathe to admit it, the threat of nuclear annihilation was greatly reduced when the Cold War ended, and we won.  This occurred due to the actions of the most radically anti-communist administration in the post war era, and was accomplished by a President whose actions and policies were in direct opposition the opinions expressed in this depiction of Oppenheimer.
I would not recommend this to anyone but those who share the opinions expressed in video.  People who are very anti-bomb or who have very left wing views would enjoy this however, as it would provide them with some artificial vindication.  Given the march of history, I guess such people need to get encouragement wherever they can find it.  As far as the rest of you are concerned, even moderate liberals as well as those to their right would find this a boring monologue of leftist cliches.",1028073600,2,2096,4.909348441926346
