5962634,5,B00F1BFWCE,My daughter and I LOVE Daniel Tiger. (Mommy might actually love him more.) He is very relatable for preschoolers and it easy to discuss with your child the topics of the episodes.,1395878400,,179,4.625
5962635,5,B00F1BFWCE,"I grew up watching Mr. Roger's Neighborhood and liked the train sets and his calm demeanor. This show is based off of that series and is geared towards the toddler - preschool age group (2-5). This DVD specifically addresses feelings and emotions. Although I tend to like this DVD more than my 2.5 year old son, I gave it 5 stars because I think the value of expressing his feelings and learning to put them in words will become something he's more comfortable with the older he gets.",1394409600,13,484,4.511363636363637

5962642,5,B00F1BFWCE,"My kids love this show so much. And I really like the different lessons and take-away messages from the different shows.

This set will make your kids use the words ""Frustrated"" and ""Jealous"" and ""Sad"" to describe how they are feeling, so it's best to follow up with actual discussion over not using the words just to get attention when they really are in need of some stimulation. That's the only issue we've had! My own fault.",1452729600,,428,4.558441558441558

5962646,5,B00F1BFWCE,"Fantastic. My 3 1/2 yr old son actually sings the little songs he learned from this DVD about dealing with feelings. One day I told him I was frustrated because I couldn't find my keys, and he sang Daniel Tiger's song: ""When you're feeling frustrated, take a step back, and ask for help.""  Then he helped me look for them. Great teaching tool about dealing with sadness, frustration, jealousy, etc.",1451433600,4,398,4.685714285714286
5962647,5,B00F1BFWCE,"We aparently needed this, they love it. Great for the 2-5 crowd.",1451347200,2,64,4.416666666666667
5962648,5,B00F1BFWCE,"We are HUGE Daniel Tiger fans in this house!  Both my 4 yo with Autism and my 2 yo love Daniel and frequently sing the songs during play or during conflict situations.  This particular DVD has been very helpful for my 4 yo when needing to adjust to major life changes, such as the birth of a younger sibling (feeling jealous) or the school year ending (feeling sad).  It's also been helpful in general for frustration tolerance.",1450483200,2,428,4.532467532467533

From  a parent's perspective, you can't go wrong with choosing sweet Daniel.  Daniel sets a good example and the show teaches appropriate lessons.  I personally love that the stories are not loud or overly silly.",1418860800,,331,4.839285714285714
5962684,5,B00F1BFWCE,"I love that I am now able to purchase Daniel Tiger on DVD. The DVD has multiple episodes on it which includes:
-Duckling Goes Home
-Daniel Feels Left Out
-Daniel Gets Frustrated
-Frustration at School
-Daniel is Jealous
-Jealousy at the Treehouse
-Someone Else's Feelings
-Empathy at School
Now keep in mind if you are at all familiar with Daniel that there are two stories in one episode so really there are only 4 actual episodes. Daniel always makes it easy for children to relate and is able to teach life lessons in a child friendly way. I'm so glad they decided to do a continuation of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood!",1418774400,15,617,4.618181818181818
