8352542,5,B0026FD4H8,This is a mechanical translation of Genesis Chapter 1 from the ancient Paleo Hebrew.  Gives the reader a more profound understanding of what the original Hebrew was saying.  This is not an easy to read English translation because of the differences in Hebrew and English and the grammar structures.  It isn't meant to be.  This is a Hebrew Resource book for those who want to delve into the pure ancient Hebrew which the scriptures were written in.,1418428800,4,448,4.779220779220779
