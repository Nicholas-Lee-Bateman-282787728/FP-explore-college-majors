6124102,3,B00GY3S7AC,"Yeah, yeah, same old, same old. Humanoid (and extremely mammalian) female space alien drops into
high school kid's bathtub, accidental touch, and they're engaged. Seen it every month.

Seriously, though, this is a series that tries to be a lot of things. Unfortunately, if fails most of the time.

It seems to want to be a harem anime, but most of the girls are indifferent to the hero, if they don't actively
dislike him. It tries to be a comedy, but too many episodes disintegrate into silliness, bordering on
stupidity.

The copy I had is Japanese with English subtitles, something I don't ordinarily mind, but so much of
the dialogue comes at you machine-gun fashion that's it's impossible to keep up. If you read all the
dialogue, you can't see what's happening; if you watch that, you miss what's being said.

Also, there is little continuity between episodes, and some seem to have been done solely to fill out
the season, having nothing at all to do with what went before, or comes after. That is not good story-telling.

With all that negativity out of the way, To Love Ru did have some redeeming qualities. The hero is a genuinely
nice guy, who thinks of others, and agonizes when he feels he's let someone down. He feels guilty over his
developing feelings for the alien girl LaLa, because of his prior feelings for the Earth girl he knew before,
Haruna (even though he's so shy he's never been able to tell Haruna how he feels).

There is quite a bit of nudity, mostly LaLa suffering one wardrobe malfunction after another, but it's part of the
overall zaniness, and actually is handled quite well.

There are sequels, I notice, but this set stands alone as a complete story, if that sort of thing worries you.",1421280000,2,1722,4.644736842105263

6124106,3,B00GY3S7AC,"The rating is for this Blu Ray release and not for the series itself. Not much point in getting this release since it is NOT dubbed.  It's still sub only and the video quality is only slightly better than the original DVD release since it is a 1080i instead of 1080p.

The series itself is a really funny and entertaining one with good character development.  But you'll get ""more bang for the buck""  buying the regular DVD Complete Collection for less money.",1397260800,7,459,4.560975609756097
6124107,3,B00GY3S7AC,"It should be noted that this release is 26 episodes on 2 Blu-Ray discs.  That's 13 episodes per disc.  Normally, a Blu-Ray anime release of this many episodes would be spread out across 3 discs (9+9+8 or 10+10+6) in order to maintain quality.  But instead of 1080p, this release is 1080i.  I should have figured that out before I ordered this set.",1395014400,24,347,4.548387096774194
6124108,5,B00GY3S7AC,I simply love this series that is why i decided to upgrade the dvds i hade of season 1 & 2 with these Blu-ray so i cude continue with with the rest of the seasons on Blu-ray. I would recommend this series to ppl who like Harem Comedy Romance and isn't offended by the occasional nude girl.,1461628800,,289,4.087719298245614
6124109,5,B00GY3S7AC,"GREAT series. Yes, it has it's fair share of ecchi. A lot of shows do, but this one offsets that with cute story lines. I feel super bad for Haruna, but when don't you when it comes to the initial love interest in an anime rom-com?",1459209600,,231,4.043478260869565

6124112,3,B00GY3S7AC,"this anime is very good, i've enjoyed watching it on the internet  its got everything a typical romantic comedy should have, however like with seasons 2-4 of familiar of zero the only thing that stops me from buying this series on dvd is that it does not have an English dub",1445299200,3,274,4.372549019607843

8628626,4,B00GY3S7AC,"This season is a lot of fun, and I enjoyed it and recommend it, but whoever put together this set did not include OVAs, which usually aren't important but ARE important for this show. Because the first episode of the second season, there's all these new characters that came out of nowhere and you immediately feel you missed something, which you did. Because the characters are introduced in the season 1 OVAs, which aren't included. So you'll have to watch some low quality online versions which in the grand scheme of things isn't a big deal but if you hadn't read this, you'd be starting season 2 seeing 3 characters that you have no idea who they are, and for the amount of money these sets cost, you SHOULD be getting the complete package.",1531094400,,745,4.567164179104478
