4189648,5,B003SPDSDU,"Though it is based on Kurosawa's work, it is definitely not a carbon-copy, and that's a great thing! It keeps the core basics of Kurosawa's movie while supplying original stories, new characters, and modern art for modern audiences. The mix of samurai and robots works well. There's great conflict in every episode. The characters are deep and have their flaws. The action scenes are a treat and it does not take a dozen episodes to get through a single battle, unlike other anime. While Kurosawa's film was good for certain reasons, Samurai 7 is good for other reasons. It is faster paced than the original movie while still devoting time to diving into plots and characterizations and fleshing out ideas and themes. I'm a big fan of samurai stories, and this is one of the best I've found. If you're a fan of anime, samurais, the original Kurosawa film or other Kurosawa films, then I highly recommend this series.",1355788800,,916,4.767295597484277
4189649,5,B003SPDSDU,"This anime is a hit world wide. The story keeps you focused and the art work never makes it old. If you are not a fan of anime, this one will change your mind!",1355702400,,159,3.7058823529411766
4189650,5,B003SPDSDU,"A small village is being targeted by bandits. Every year the bandits come for their rice and women. The villagers decide to send their priestess to the city to find 7 samurai to protect them.

This is a great retelling of an old classic. The animation and music are both great. There are also many big name voice talents to go along with all the super cool characters. This anime has a very epic feel to it. There's a good mix of action, drama, and comedy. It's simply a masterpiece. One of the greatest samurai animes I've ever seen. There's so much you can say about this series. I'm a having a hard time expressing how cool it is, but you can trust me when I say just watch it. You'll love it.",1350518400,5,696,4.2330827067669174
4189651,5,B003SPDSDU,"I must admit that I am not really ""into"" Japanese anime but this set of DVD's could just change my mind. The art work is great and plenty of action. Do not get up to make coffee and leave the disc running as you will inevitably miss crucial parts of the story. Great fun for the young and old who like Samurai action.

4189652,5,B003SPDSDU,"I've seen the series before, and its great! All the characters are different in looks and personality, but all come together as a great team. There's a lot of humor, action, bits of betrayal and friendship, and a little hint of romance. It takes something great and gives it a little bit of a futuristic taste. I watched it with my boyfriend and it automatically became one of his favorites, so I decided to buy it for him. I was surprised, I actually received it within two days of ordering it which is great because I hate waiting weeks for something to get here. And it came wrapped and sealed in plastic with the DVDs inside a nice solid hard case box so if anyone is clumsy like me, they won't totally destroy it. I definitely recommend this product, you won't regret it!",1349222400,2,776,4.433566433566433
4189653,5,B003SPDSDU,"A must have for any anime fan. Samurai 7 has everything: swords, samurai, giant robot bad guys, and a great adaptation of a classic story. Not to mention that you get a DVD for each of the 7 samurai all packaged neatly!",1315612800,8,219,4.238095238095238
4189654,5,B003SPDSDU,"So, you are probably wondering weather or not you should purchase this as apposed
to the original 2007 full box set. Well, I will tell you why you should..
This box set has all seven original dvds in it, It comes in a nice durable box (similar to the
anime legends re release of Cowboy Bebop) with amazing artwork on the front. Unfortunatly
the dvd does not come with with interchangable artwork... So you only have the original
which is still nice.
Also, unlike the original Viridian Collection, there is not VIRIDIAN COLLECTION sticker on the front
that ruins the box, instead there is a small little icon that adds to the ambience on the side of the dvd.
Moving on to special features.. Its pretty standard unfortunatly, actor commentarys etc.. so if you like
Christopher Sabat, then you will like the commentaries.. I am definatly considering rewatching the series with
commentaries, its nice to hear what the actors/producers have to say.
Moving on to story, I don't have much to say about the story other then the fact that once you watch it, youll fall
in love with all the characters. ALL of them...

BUY THIS!!! IT IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ANIME FAN/COLLECTOR.",1298592000,26,1167,4.665048543689321

4189660,5,B003SPDSDU,"Samurai 7 is a really well done series both in its production and writing styles.  The characters were energetically portrayed with uniquely believable personalities!  Very appealing animation style coupled with a well balanced steampunk detailing made for great visual impact.  Not necessarily annoying or totally predictable in its storyline and character interaction.  Great dimensionality to the landscape locations, which ranged widely.  Great costume design, which to me is always a major plus.  If you like anime, but are easily annoyed with character voices and predictable plots, then definitely watch this series, you will enjoy Samurai 7 very much!",1383436800,,659,5.673469387755102
4189661,4,B003SPDSDU,This anime is very slow in the start out but picks up an episode or two. It was kind of easy to guess for me..... What was going to happen and who would die and all that. But that's just me. The plot was the thing that makes you want to continue into it. Satisfaction for me was guaranteed.,1371081600,,290,3.9322033898305087

8404679,5,B003SPDSDU,"It is a funny thing that when I first watched this series when it came out some years ago, I came away feeling not too fond of it even though Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is one of my favorite films.

It was a sense of nostalgia that made me select it as a purchase. Sometimes nostalgia buys don't work out (ex: ""Peacemaker Kurogane"" was definitely a 'of the moment' series for me and I barely got through the first DVD on a recent rewatch), but ""Samurai 7"" was a pleasant surprise on the rewatch. Albeit it isn't as good as the movie that inspires it, it is still very entertaining and kept very much to the spirit of its inspiration. Set in an alternate world in which a farming village needs help against bandits (samurai who have become bandits due to their displacement by the rise of the merchant class), a young village priestess with her little sister and fellow villager who is a rice farmer set off to the city to gather some samurai to help battle the bandits.

It does go a little longer here and there, but overall, the look, feel and characterizations are very well done. As with the original movie, the farmer/samurai Kikochiyo steals the show but I was impressed on this latest viewing of how sympathetic I was to the young samurai, Katsushiro. In the case of Katsushiro, I actually feel like the anime bests the original movie, but that's just my opinion.

Anyway, I'm definitely pleased that I picked this one up. Nostalgia or not, it was an enjoyable watch.",1527292800,,1480,4.535580524344569
