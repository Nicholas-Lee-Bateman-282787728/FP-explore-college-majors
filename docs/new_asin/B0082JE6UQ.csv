8524248,5,B0082JE6UQ,"The Book by Carlton is I.M.O. a must as well as his DVD series. I believe everyone will benefit from reading the Book & Watching the DVD'S. see my review of his book.

He goes over a lot in the DVD'S. such as needle selection, why he tattoos Mag first. Machine Set Up's, Color Theories..

I highly. Recommend these  DVD'S.

Take Care, Bill Kearney. :-)",1424563200,,352,4.369230769230769
