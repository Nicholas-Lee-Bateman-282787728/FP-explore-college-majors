7880885,5,6305029512,"I was very pleased with Ms. Baxendale as Cordelia Gray as well as all the other actors in the various episodes, including the very capable Annette Crosbie as her secretary. The images of London and elsewhere are attractive and interesting, and while the shows are short on the chills and thrills and high-paced excitement geared to American tastes, they are similar to other British shows which are more low-key and generally lacking in the sinister and ugly aspects of life and humanity present in stuff here which leads people to prefer products from England (Inspector Morse, George Gently, Dalziel and Pascoe, Inspector Lewis, Foyle's War, etc.) I advise viewers, however, to read the novel by P.D. James in order to see how the show departs from the original concept. Fortunately, the effect is not at all damaging, and I am certain that others will also be as satisfied as was I.",1400198400,,885,4.867549668874172
7880886,5,6305029512,"This video contains two excellent stories by one of Britain's mystery writer queens, P. D. James.
Helen Baxendale is perfect in this series, and I have watched these several times. Certainly having
 this is imperative in one's collection of James' mysteries.",1377216000,,258,5.2926829268292686
7880887,3,6305029512,"I contacted WGBH Boston to inquire about discrepencies in the listed runtime, and was informed that there was a printing error on the VHS jackets that resulted in people thinking this series was meant to be twice as long as it actually was. I hope that helps people make a decision. I remember really enjoying this series when it was first aired on American PBS.",1110758400,2,362,4.584615384615384
7880888,1,6305029512,"I've enjoyed most of PD James' books so I was pleased to buy the PBS video.  However, I was very disappointed to watch these tapes.  As the previous reviewer wrote, the tapes are incomplete.  Do not buy this version.  You will only be frustrated.  Stick with the books!",978652800,4,269,4.520833333333333
7880889,1,6305029512,"The box advertises this set as two tales - a three part and a two part.  The total run time is 330 minutes and is comprised of two tapes.  However, each tape is only 55 min long - so there should be six tapes.  The first  two tapes are parts I and II of the first tale, then tape III is part I of  the second.  Obviously something is missing.  And yes, we fast forwarded to  the end after committing two hours to watch 2 of 3 episodes and then not to  be able to finish is disappointing as best.",947462400,7,495,3.87
