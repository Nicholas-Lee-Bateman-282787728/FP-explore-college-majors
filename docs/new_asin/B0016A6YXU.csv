8261911,5,B0016A6YXU,I found this DVD to be in keeping with my experience with sight-size instruction. It has clarified a lot of misconception about the sight-size method. I especially like the historical background information that was provided. I highly recommend this DVD to students and teachers who would like to add this concept of drawing to their library.,1394668800,2,342,5.125
8261912,3,B0016A6YXU,This a good beginners DVD to set up a drawing from a model. It is something you woudl be unlikely to review more than once.,1354147200,,123,3.96
8261913,4,B0016A6YXU,"the dvd and the book go great together, the guy talks like a robot but you don't notice it after a while,thats the only complaint i have on the audio. his finished cast drawing isn't quite up to par with atelier standards,but it does send you in the right direction,you will just need to work on your drawing for 2-3 months",1316736000,4,323,4.311475409836065
8261914,5,B0016A6YXU,"The DVD ""Sight Size And The Art Of Seeing"" gives a clear and self-contained explanation of a method (hundreds of years old) that has been used in training artists to draw realistic images. It has also been used by some artists to produce their finished work.

The basic idea of the ""sight size"" method is to place the canvas or drawing paper in a location where the drawing and the object-to-be-drawn appear to have the same size.  One way to do this is to put the canvas beside the object and to stand back about 8 ft so that both are in view.  This is the method shown in the video.  In such a setup, the artist must walk back and forth, alternating between the tasks of observing and actually drawing.

The term ""cast drawing"" refers to the exercise of drawing a white plaster cast of an object, which is also an old method of training artists.  Drawing a cast focuses one's attention on the degrees of light and dark without distracting the eye with color or fine texture.  Judging by other ""sight size"" material on the web, when ""sight size"" is used as teaching method,  the student usually does a ""cast drawing"". The entire DVD is concerned with doing one such ""cast drawing"". (The cast is shown on the cover of the DVD).

The narrator in the DVD speaks clearly and concisely.  I wouldn't mind if he spoke at a faster cadence, but I do find listening to him rather calming and soothing.  He is narrating from a carefully written script instead of making spontaneous remarks. The DVD has an adequate explanation of the drawing materials (sharpened charcoal sticks, kneaded eraser etc.) There is footage overlaid with computer graphics to show the the artist's view of cast and the drawing.  It explains how the artist makes various measurements, sighting with a plumb line or straight edge.  The drawing process is organized into stages, beginning with accurately establishing the outline of the object. (Don't be alarmed that the DVD begins playing with a brief interlude of excepts accompanied by music. The rest of it proceeds in a step-by-step fashion.)

I rate this video as five stars out of five to indicate that it is a superior art instruction DVD compared to similarly priced Amazon DVDs that I have recently viewed. This is not a claim that the ""sight size"" exercise will necessarily be useful training for a student or that everyone can adapt to the procedure of walking back and forth to their canvas.  What I intend to indicate by my rating are the following contrasts between ""Sight Size"" and many other DVDs about drawing:

The ""Sight Size"" DVD is a self-contained course.  Many other DVDs simply show an artist drawing a picture and chatting about it.  Some of the chatter may be too technical for a reader untrained in anatomy to appreciate (e.g. ""great trochantor"", ""scapula"").  Sometimes the artist may be babbling in ways that aren't informative (e.g ""I don't like that""  ""Let me darken that a little"".) Such informal presentations can be useful if you don't mind learning by watching instead of attending to what is said.  The ""Sight Size"" DVD does not show a real time record of the drawing or every small detail of work. (On the DVDs that I have seen, when an artist does a real time drawing, he finishes by remarking that ""This is just a sketch"",or ""This is only a study"" and the DVD shows some of his other pictures that took more time to draw.)

""Sight Size"" does mention a related website and a book with the same title. You don't need to consult either of them to understand the material  Other DVDs about drawing that I have seen are also advertisements for web courses or the next DVD in a series.

I have the following minor complaints about ""Sight Size"".  I didn't see an explanation of the ""mahl stick"" which the artist uses. (You can easily look this tool up on the web.)  Using Windows Vista and the MS media player, it was hard to get the sections of the DVD to begin to play.  I had to carefully observe when my cursor changed from an arrow to the shape of the hand to find the ""sweet spot"" that I could click to start the video.  Even doing this, it felt like a hit-or-miss process.  Many clicks simply changed the medial player from full screen to small screen.",1270684800,16,4206,4.5855614973262036
