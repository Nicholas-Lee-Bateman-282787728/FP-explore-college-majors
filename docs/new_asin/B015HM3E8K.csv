7437136,5,B015HM3E8K,"I foolishly questioned this spy thriller film. Now I know I was a fool and the film is a triumph, in the spirit of greatness that follows men like Spielberg, Hanks, Alda, and Rylance. They create film worlds from drive, not just for the need of a noon meal. They choose roles/films, and in Bridge of Spies they selectedc well, and performed at their peak.

I was nostalgically blown away; away back to 1957 (I was age 9). I was there doing the school air raid drills of duck & cover, Elvis Rock 'n Roll, hearing of Sputnik, U2 shot down, American Bandstand, the perfect Chevy design, the Berlin wall being built brick by brick with barbed wire and blood, B&W TV, living in a family of 7 and Mom wore Pop-it Beads.
I was wrong to expect the normal spy-thriller stunt-action filled drivel. This film looks as people, lifestyle, events, and the subdued real-history ambiance of the late 1950s Cold War, Americans Boomer Norman Rockwell families, and ideas and secrets being the wars front line. Spielberg caught the era perfectly. Tom Hanks takes viewers to a flag-waving feel-good-about-America ending.
I was as mesmerized in Bridge of Spies period cinematography as happened with Spielbergs War Horse, Saving Private Ryan, Schindlers List, & Lincoln.

Insurance lawyer Donovan (Hanks) gets the official nod to defend a KGB officer/spy (Mark Rylance The Other Boleyn Girl) whos to be traded for downed U2 pilot Powers (Austin Stowell). Donovans wife (Amy Ryan) is perfection as the typical 1950s mom/housewife in action, word, and wardrobe. She made me feel like I was looking through my own family photo scrapbooks. Dont forget Alan Aldas (M*A*S*H) always perfect performances, as 50s honest as the Korean War.

One to view big in the cinema followed by ordering the DVD or stream.
What a fool I was to expect less. This is good for film intellectuals.

7437137,5,B015HM3E8K,"Please read no further, if you are concerned about spoilers....

The refreshingly wholesome theme of this movie seems to simply be the importance of doing the right thing.  Tom Hanks' James Donovan is an ""everyman"" placed on center stage by the unfolding of history.",1445212800,,266,5.0227272727272725
7437138,5,B015HM3E8K,"Once again our favorite Everyman Tom Hanks is working with his long- time friend and collaborator Steven Spielberg (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers""). These guys seem convinced that Americans need to know more WWII history. Lucky for us the Coen brothers are on the writing team, they bring some very dry humor to the Cold War as we watch two superpowers (plus East Germany) negotiate an exchange of spies.

This time Hanks is an insurance lawyer ordered to defend a Russian spy. His reluctance to side with the enemy is justified when his family is targeted by outraged citizens who now see him as anti-American. We also watch as some Air Force pilots are assigned to the CIA; they will fly camera-equipped U2 spy planes 70,000 feet above the USSR. They are called ""drivers"" and are instructed to commit suicide if they are caught. They are stunned!

We see:
  * Tom Hanks (""The Terminal"") is perfect as James Donovan, a highly rated attorney who hasn't practiced criminal law in decades. He's smart, funny, and very, very resourceful. He quickly realizes his ""client"" will be denied Constitutional protection by the American courts. As a lawyer responsible for an accused prisoner, all he can do now is try to prevent the death penalty.
  * Amy Ryan (""Birdman:..."") is Mary, his wife. When he goes to East Berlin to negotiate a trade - his Russian spy for the American pilot of a downed spy plane - she thinks he's going to Scotland to fish.
  * Alan Alda (""The Longest Ride"") is Thomas Watters, Donovan's boss. It's at his insistence that Donovan must take up this case.
  * Austin Stowell (""Behind the Candelabra"") is Francis Gary Powers, a U2 pilot (not the band!) who was shot down from Russian skies.
  * Mark Rylance (""Wolf Hall"") is amazing as Rudolf Abel, the notorious agent who meticulously eludes discovery for so long. When asked if he is frightened, he replies, ""Would it help?""
  * Sebastian Koch (""The Lives of Others"") Wolfgang Vogel is the East German official who resents being overlooked by the two superpowers who ignore him...in his own city!
  * Will Rogers (""The Bay"") is Frederic Pryor, a student caught behind the Berlin wall as he tries to rescue his girlfriend. Donovan wants him to be part of the deal, too.

The Cold War, Donovan, Abel, Powers... Many of these names will draw a blank from the younger generation because History as a school subject is no longer considered politically correct. Do they know about the Berlin Wall? We see it being built in this wonderful film; AND for period touches, we see an astonishing array of vintage cars, plus discarded flash bulbs on the floor. In addition, Donovan makes a terrific speech to the Supreme Court about what makes America unique.

I can't help but recall George Santanaya's immortal quote: ""Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" More's the pity... Every young American should see this PG-13 movie. (By the way, be sure to stay for the terrific postscripts!)",1445126400,5,2981,4.777777777777778
7437139,4,B015HM3E8K,"""Bridge of Spies"" (2015 release; 141 min.)  brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is ""1957, the height of the cold war"". We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a ""fair shake"", the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical ""inspired by true events"" movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly ""by the numbers"". The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and  Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: ""you're not worried?"", to which Abel responds: ""would it help?"", ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found ""Bridge of Spies"" strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.

""Bridge of Spies"" opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out ""Bridge of Spies"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1445040000,2,2984,4.624528301886793
7437140,5,B015HM3E8K,"It is 1957.  The Cold War is well underway.  The United States and the Soviet Union, each fearing the other's nuclear arsenal, are engaged in an intense espionage duel.  ""Bridge of Spies"" opens with the arrest of Rudolf Abel, Soviet spy, in Brooklyn, New York.  Insurance lawyer James Donovan is asked to provide his defense at trial, a thankless task that Donovan nevertheless undertakes with more than due diligence.  Meanwhile, the CIA is recruiting pilots for its highly secret U-2 program.  One of the recruits is Air Force1LT Francis Gary Powers.  Powers will be shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960 and convicted of espionage by a Soviet court.

Donovan will be asked by the CIA to arrange an exchange of Powers for Abel.  Donovan travels to Berlin, arriving just as East Germany is putting up its infamous wall, trapping its own citizenry and at least one unfortunate American student on the wrong side.  Donovan will shuttle back and forth between East and West, navigating several bureaucracies and multiple political fault lines to try to negotiate an exchange. In the end, the story, and the suspense, comes down to a darkened bridge between the two Berlins and the question of who will be exchanged...

Director Steven Spielberg has done a masterful job presenting this movie, which is authentic to the period and nuanced in its delivery.  He doesn't hide the U.S. government's hardball pursuit of Abel, but plainly portrays the brutality of the East German government.  Tom Hanks as Donovan steals the show as a principled man walking a narrow line in a high stakes competition.  Mark Rylance manages to make the spy Abel a sympathetic figure.  Scott Shepherd is watchable as Donovan's CIA contact and foil.  There is an excellent supporting cast, including Amy Ryan as Donovan's wife and a cameo by Alan Alda as Donovan's boss.  Highly recommended, especially to those who lived the Cold War.",1445040000,2,1910,4.93730407523511

7437150,5,B015HM3E8K,"Steven Spielberg directs one of his finest films with this relevant espionage historical drama. The idea that all people deserve rights and legal representation is more relevant than ever before. The direction is immaculately crafted with beautiful long panning shots and careful visual storytelling. We witness U.S., Russian, and German diplomacy during the Cold War. It's a very interesting prisoner negotiation movie.

The Coen Brothers wrote a very thoughtful and fair script that depicts all countries honestly, while also entertaining the audience with jokes and knowledge. Strong writing and dialogue leads Bridge of Spies to excellence.

Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the charge with their complex portrayals of historical figures Donovan and Abel. Hanks plays it straight with some humor to humanize his lawyer. He captures Donovan's dedication to the law, justice, and decency. Meanwhile, Rylance plays Abel with a cold poker face and a knowing somber tone. These are great actors at their peak skills. Bridge of Spies is all the more delightful because of their performances.

In all, Bridge of Spies is an important movie for Spielberg to recount a moment in history, while also being accessible to all audiences and enjoyable simultaneously.",1530662400,,1256,5.3979591836734695

Hanks was impeccable in his holding to human values rather than caving in to the cynicism of the other political figures in the film-the CIA agents, the American public, and the Russian and East German political figures. The Cold War was portrayed as a time of bitter acrimony and hatred directed at the wrong people for the wrong reasons. Mass psychology was pictured as a part of American life at that time. The Russian side was pictured in all its one-sided brutality and ugliness  His skillful role as a clever and subtle negotiator, Mark Rylance's dogged and matter of fact, philosophical playing of his part as the spy, the unyielding judge, the people in position of authority from the lawyers to the police and the embassy staff, all these combined to  make this a convincing, close-to-real-life picture of the relationships that are part of the political world at any time.

7437235,5,B015HM3E8K,"A fine film. Excellent acting, well-written, and the scenes of Berlin as the wall is going up are excellent. James Donovan (Hanks) is drafted into defending Rudolf Abel, a Soviet spy, and later, is drafted into the lead role of exchanging Abel for Francis Gary Powers, an American shot down during a U-2 spying flight over the Soviet Union. In defending Abel against the death penalty, Donovan argues that if Americans are ever captured spying, we wouldn't want them executed, and it might be possible some day even to exchange such prisoners, obviously the plot of the film.

But Spielberg also has Donovan argue that Abel was loyally doing what he saw as in the interest of his country just as we're shown that Powers was doing as well. Here, Spielberg falls into moral equivalence. Abel had worked for the Soviets under Stalin, a regime that murdered millions. In the film we see the communists building the Berlin wall to keep its subjects from escaping (I was in Berlin, visited the East through Check Point Charlie in its heyday), gunning down people who try, arresting and torturing people. Donovan even talks to Abel about whether he, Abel, will be shot by his masters if he returns. Spielberg offers moral distortion by showing Abel as a quiet, introspective man who paints for a hobby and, oh yes, is somehow honorable as a spy for the regime he works for. Spielberg did not do this in ""Schindler's List,"" though he flirted with it in ""Munich"" as well.

""Bridge of Spies"" is a fine film but Spielberg could have avoided moral equivalence and made a more interesting film if, instead of presenting Abel as an honorable man, he had given us a glance of the darkness inside that would cause Adel, certainly not a savage brute himself, to work for the cause of savage brutes.",1511568000,4,1781,4.705128205128205

I didn't know all the back story, so this film is a good history lesson as well as being a good story. I like the feeling that this is a black and white film, though in fact it is not. If you like films like ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" then you'll like this one as well.

7437301,5,B015HM3E8K,"So much to love about this movie: Rylance/Hanks pairing of exquisitely balanced temperaments and the sets which include German Democratic Republic messengers bicycling through embassy hallways, wooden and chrome interior of the public train, and horrors of wintry Eastern Germany with gangs, wild dogs and citizens beings shot like dogs for attempting to cross over the newly erected Berlin Wall. This is in contrast to swell, sunny Fifties Cold War Brooklyn -- you know, back when everybody was white and the Russians were scheming? All of the groups of white men in various office settings, agendas flying, characters unfolding.
We witness Hanks and Rylance act according to principles without expectation of decency in return. Hanks, an impassioned defender of the Constitution, gets nothing but grief from his wife (the unrelentingly excellent Amy Ryan), his boss, the CIA and an assortment of wack diplomats. A man true to his word he stays solid and grounded in the face of drama, preening and pretense. Getting neither respect, acknowledgement, nor support he persists in a string of melodramatic exchanges as exactly who and what he is: the reliable insurance guy who acts and communicates clearly, consistently, firmly and calmly.
Rylance embodies a drier, more detached persona. His character understands all and expects nothing. When confronted with his lawyer's honorable practices he communicates the perfect parable to illustrate simultaneously his true appreciation in tandem with his awareness that much is outside of either of their control. He utters such truisms as ""I'm not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan, although it is not my first choice.""
This brings me to the screenplay which was written by - - - the Coen brothers! and some other guy.
Props to Scott Shepherd, the dickless Agency guyunburdened by subtlety or empathy, the perfect foil, or fool, to Hanks' Donovan who will not suffer him gladly.
As with Lincoln, and Schindler, Spielberg is depicting another ubermensch who keeps his head as the surrounding crowd morphs into a mob. There are so many elegant details, including a nickel extracted from a spy cache that neatly separates for the transmission of coded messages. Spielberg's cinematographer embraces extremes of climate from slick black umbrellas in the darkest, densest downpour to copious flurries among bombed out buildings, soldiers, guns and gangs.
And in the midst of all the hullaballoo two smart, solid, stolid characters acknowledging their shared qualities across a binary cultural divide.",1495843200,,2534,5.3375

7437340,1,B015HM3E8K,"Why does nobody care that this is such a globalist/progressive re-write of history. So typical of Hollywood to make a liberal sermon instead of just tell the truth. There is total moral equivalence made here between post 1950's Russia that killed 40 million of its own citizens and the US. Americans are portrayed as bigoted morons while the Russian is like Jesus. The real nuclear threat of the USSR is completely minimized, while the hero is a liberal judicial activist. The courts of this era wisely ruled that aliens should be treated with human rights, but then went way overboard giving them every right and entitlement of citizens. Tom Hanks is the brave hero that stands for the ""constitution"" and ""American"" values when in reality the left hates the constitution and traditional American values. This is a clear immigration apologetic designed to draw sympathy for the current globalist efforts to deluge America with immigrants, criticize our history, and elevate other cultures. One clear problem is that only West is engaging in this suicide cultural self doubt. Thanks Tom and Steve.

7437367,5,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies is a dad movie. In fact, it is one of the most dad movies I have ever seen. It is pleasant and predictable and slightly overlong with an upbeat feel good ending that brings a sniffle and tear to dad's eye. Honestly, I have to go back to The Right Stuff to find a more dad movie.

Tom Hanks plays Tom Hanks as if Tom Hanks found himself in To Kill a Mockingbird all of a sudden. So much so one fully expected his younger daughter to be named Scout. In all fairness, he mixes this in with a segue into Mr. Smith goes to Washington and a touch of Walter Mitty. In other words, he has gone full all American Dad. All that said he is actually quite good in the role. Like he is wearing a comfortable pair of shoes.

The movie is well cast. Every shot is well composed with the experienced eye of Spielberg. It is an incredibly handsome movie even if it sometimes comes across as a little safe.

There is one scene in particular with Toms daughter Scout watching television and a said to my wife someone is going to throw a brick through the window. There was no reason for the scene set-up and shot except for the brick through the window trope. (Which in all fairness actually happened in real life except neither Hanks character nor his family were home at the time)

Interestingly the movie was actually attempted to be filmed before with Gregory Peck in 1965 but was considered too sensitive due to Cold War tensions. This was the perfect Gregory Peck role.

Spielberg got a tear in my eye at the end and the film was more entertaining than it had any right to be. If you have a dad in your life spend a nice Sunday afternoon watching this film with him. You won't regret it.",1487894400,,1690,4.252336448598131

Gary Francis Power is barely portrayed in the movie, the shooting down of the U2 was not well done, and was some unnecessary errors in the period details. Subway passengers are reading the never existing New York Register but in another shot someone is reading the New York Post. Instead of the Register, there were the NY Daily Mirror, The Herald Tribune, or The NY World-Telegram and Sun that were newspapers of that era.

Nitpicking aside, I highly recommend the movie. 4.5 stars out of 5.",1487894400,,599,4.815533980582524

7437379,5,B015HM3E8K,"I'll give it 5 starts for being exceedingly excellent on all levels of directing, cinematography, writing, and production/set design. Spielberg is certainly one of the few directors who understand the craft of film-making backwards and forwards start to finish.

Spielberg and Coen brothers fans should be warned, however, that both director and script favor understatement in their story-telling. The most exciting moment is a 5-10 minute sequence when Gary Powers and his U-2 get shot down over Russia. The rest of the movie deals with Hanks and many other decent individuals trying to do the right thing in a maze of international relations and misinformed public opinion. Because this is a Spielberg movie, you can be sure that hard work and common decency are rewarded--tho' Spielberg and his writers are careful to show in the movie's last 30 minutes that problems of evil and corruption still threaten our beloved American way of life.

All praise aside, I don't buy the idea that many spies in the Cold War were average guys drafted under false pretenses and then hung out to dry by their deceptive cold-hearted sponsor countries. I think there was some truth to the cloak-and-dagger clichs. The CIA, for example, was actively involved in numerous assassination and coup attempts. These covert operatives were not just a bunch of swell guys who were just trying to help out their country.

I also wondered--I ask for everyone's pardon here--how Spielberg's and the Coens' attitude toward their material would have been different if they had made a movie about anti-Jewish Nazi spies before the end of WWII. My guess is that their attitude toward the spy game would have been more negative and critical. But this opinion is just a surmising on my part.

Even though the movie's view of Cold War politics might be inaccurate and overly forgiving, it's an excellent piece of entertainment. You can't go wrong with it.

P.S. The movie uses the Cuban missile crisis to great dramatic effect, but most historians these days will tell you that the importance of the whole thing was greatly exaggerated. No doubt many Americans felt terrified, but, whether you launch the missiles from Cuba, Eastern Europe, or some submarine off the New England coast, the nuclear threat would have been same.",1486857600,,2293,5.023684210526316

7437384,5,B015HM3E8K,"Rudolf Abel, a Russian spy is caught in NY. Everyone believes he is guilty. James Donovan, portrayed by Tom Hanks, is defending him. Jim is being followed by the CIA, they want to make sure that he does the right thing, lose the case. Evidence was gathered without a search warrant and Jim requests that the evidence not be allowed during the trial.  The court denies the blocking of the evidence. The sentence will probably be a death penalty and Rudolf is found guilty as quickly as possible by the jury and the court.

Even the family of Jim is questioning why he is defending a spy that wants to kill them with a nuclear bomb.  Jim asks the judge not to give Rudolf the death penalty as the USA may need to trade him in the future for an American spy who may be captured in the future.  Rudolf is convicted to serve 30 years in prison. The courtroom goes crazy as they wanted Rudolph to be executed.

Jim wants to appeal but his law firm and wife fight him to stop.  The public is so upset that someone shoots into Jims home and almost hits his daughter. His children are terrified. Jim goes onto the Supreme Court to defend Rudolf. They lose again with a 5 to 4 vote.

Francis David Powers is being recruited for a U2 pilot. He is told to die with his plane if shot down. They are given a suicide silver dollar with a poison pin. His plane is shot down on his first mission.  He fails to blow up the plane or to commit suicide. His cockpit cover rips off and he is jerked out of the pane before he can destroy it. This occurs in 1960.

The CIA wants Jim Donovan to negotiate the swap of the spies as an independent person. They want Jim to go to East Berlin. Legally he represents no one so he does not represent the USA. East Berlin is very dangerous at that time as they are building the Berlin Wall.  Jim lies to his wife and leaves for Europe on a secret CIA mission..

This is an excellent film. What else can you expect from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks?  The casting of this film and the storyline and acting is first class. Having grown up when this was taking place makes this movie a repeat history lesson for someone at my age. We all knew the story of the U2 Crash in Russia and this film just brought back all of the fear between the superpowers during the Cold War.

Having passed through this checkpoint during this time, i can attest to the tensions surrounding the passage from West to east Berlin. The Vopo[East German soldiers ]were as grim as the film portrays.
The  movie captures what happens when an individual as one enters a totalitarian state. Individual rights did not exist.
Tom Hanks captures the spirit of a civilian entering the unknown in defense of a civilian and an airman Gary Powers.

Movies like this remind us why we should treasure our national heritage, remember what makes our country great, and be spurred to maintain that strength without wavering. Tom Hanks spectacularly portrays a man of great fortitude and integrity, a lawyer who truly believes in our legal system, stands firm in defending human rights, and is unashamedly Christian, all qualities our current media has attempted to denigrate. I believe our nation was not only built by individuals like the man this film examines, we remain as a standard bearer of freedom throughout the world because such fine citizens are still found throughout this nation, raising familes, worshipping according to the dictates of their consciences, respecting the laws which govern us, and engaging in the political system we've inherited with the hopes of assuring a safe, secure, and prosperous future for our children. Please, please, please, stop tearing down this beautiful USA, and bring our nation's focus back to where it should be -- on the elements that, like this man's heroism, courage, and compassion, are worth emulating.

7437625,5,B015HM3E8K,"The thing about Tom Hanks, is that he will play a role so truthfully, so fully humanistic of that characters traits that Tom himself is nowhere to be found. Like the U2 song, ""baby, you're nowhere,"" And yet, he is...Tom Hanks. From Philadelphia to that stranded Island movie, I forget the name, from Road to Perdition; and onwards, his extensive, impressive career seriously never falters. And everyone knows this about Tom Hanks. He will be your hero. He will lead us home. He's got that voice, that sparkle in his eyes and that goodness of spirit, the camera simply cannot ignore.

When the movie starts, Donovan is a cunning Insurance lawyer and he immediately pulls you in with his quick thinking outsmarting the ""other five guys"", certainly not ""his guy"", who Donovan keeps saying isn't even ""his guy"".

Insurance claims litigation is like untangling a ball of wadded up silly string. Some fun!

Spielberg does something he is known for, he turns the tables on the viewer's emotions. We are supposed to hate that Russian spy. Oh, yes. Hate him and Hang him!-and yet, it becomes impossible (at least for me anyway), to have anything but overwhelming admiration for his stoicism and true fear for this man's fate.

Bridge of Spies is so relevant for today because it throws basic humanity back in our faces.
Are we truly so callous that we, THE  United States of America wouldn't even deign to try a man using the very Constitutional Rights we all live, vote, and breathe beneath? Are we such hedonistic cavemen, that our society has devolved to the point of no return?

Honestly, today, I look out at a strange society.
I turn on the news. I turn it off.
People are doing and saying things that nobody I ever knew would ever say or do. It feels as though at times, we are stuck in reverse, going backwards in our thinking expecting to rise up, only to devolve into an economically and socially divisive future that is threatening our very quality of life and the very way we as a country grow together. How we long for those good olden days. Not the segregated days, but rather better days when people were just people and though racism is a deep chasm and yes, it even involves democracy and spy movies (you better believe it), days when we were just a little kinder to one another. When you didn't need plexiglass at a gas station because the person who desperately needs that job is in real danger of getting shot. All for working at minimum wage. It makes no sense!

We all want something else. And yet, like it or not, we are all the same. Same beating hearts, same hurts, same tears in our eyes. Why can't we all see that?

When I get my tires checked, regular good guys are there with a kindness in thir eyes that reminds me, it's all okay, we're not really in that lost tv land of nomads and fire and brimstone.

This movie, Bridge of Spies, shows us just how good we all really do have it. It takes us to the Berlin wall and puts us on a train watching people getting shot to death, for trying to get to the other side.
Is THAT what we want in America? Our very own Berlin WALL??
Have we learned nothing?
People shooting people.
Is that who we want to become?
I kind of wish Bridge of Spies had waited to be released until right about now.

The bravery of James Donovan and what HE did for our country. And how ultimately, he saved so many prisoners, is a lauded story, one that I never knew. Schools should be talking about James Donovan and the great art of negotiation. Instead of the art of trash talk.

It's a movie you will cheer and cry to. And most importantly makes you feel like, YES!!! There is a Standing Man in this world!!-and makes you want to try hard to stand up for what you also believe in.

You can choose to hate the spy, or you can look at him as Donovan did, and ask, is he first, a human being?-and what of our own soldiers captured overseas?
If we cannot bestow humanity upon this spy, who are we as a nation?

I see this movie as an excellent example of diplomacy, negotiations and how countries work together even when those countries clearly hate each others guts. It would make an excellent class discussion and debate subject. Which no doubt is already occurring in schools across this country. I certainly hope so. Bravo Steven Spielberg. Bravo Tom Hanks. And such a heartwarming performance by Mark Rylance, Bravo!!!",1476576000,,4361,4.484237074401009

7437641,5,B015HM3E8K,"This movie Bridge of Spies jumped out at me because it seemed like it would be a perfect film of intense suspense. My premonitions were correct and I unexpectedly became a little more informed during the movie about international relations. Tom Hanks stars as James B. Donovan., a character very much committed to upholding what the U.S. constitution stands for when it comes to his clients. Donovans life is turned dramatically upside down when he is assigned the case of Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). This is because the character of Donovan is shown going through so much via having his life and that of his family in danger after he does his job of defending Abel (much to the chagrin of some the people who knew Donovan professionally). Despite extreme public condemnation, Donovan successfully fights for Abel with the argument that such a situation may set a precedent in the situation that an American is captured by the USSR.  Donovan experiences some redemption from professional criticism of what he advocated for Abel when Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the USSR after his aircraft is shot down. Additionally, the film features an American college student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was captured by the Eastern Germany police forces. However, Donovans work is far from done when this happens. I want to share more details in this review but I understand that I must take into account anyone seeing this who has not yet seen the film.

7437643,5,B015HM3E8K,"This is a review of Chasing Summits by Garry Harrington.  This is a great adventure book, very hard to put down.  I have read or listened to a lot of adventure/climbing books, but this is one of the best.  Garry's adventures tagging high peaks and the state high points across the U.S. are entertaining and even amusing at times.  Even an armchair climber can vicariously enjoy his descriptions of the difficulties he encounters on his summit attempts.  His travels to climb in Mexico and Central America take the reader to places that they most likely have never been to, and expose the  reader to new cultures and experiences.  I highly recommend this well written book for anyone who has ever looked at a mountain and wondered how it could be climbed.",1475712000,,754,4.709923664122138

Makes me want to read James Donovan's ""Strangers on a Bridge,"" and study the transcripts from the associated Supreme Court hearings.  I'm not sure how much artistic license was used in either the book or movie, though the words offered by Mr Donovan in front of the Court cast a hugely positive light on the American spirit, if not the entire justice system writ large.

One non-film criticism is that ""purchase"" was the only option.  Please keep renting as an option, as very few films merit multiple viewings.  That said, I wish I would have purchased the version that included extras for the same price because I would love to know more about the background.",1475539200,,716,4.688

Tom Hanks pulls off another powerful performance showing yet again that he is one of the premier actors of his generation.  Hanks, Spielberg and Rylance pull off a memorable, powerful experience.

Like some of you, I've heard people say, ""It's too slow"" or ""It's boring"" or ""There's no action.""  That's not the point of this movie at all.  It is all high suspense and a private citizen navigating an unknown new landscape in the aftermath of WWII in the eastern bloc under the shadow of the USSR and East Germany.

The acting is superb, the story line is engaging, and the experience is memorable.

For me this is a 5-star experience and I strongly encourage more than one viewing.  I've found that every time I've watched this film the more I've liked it and the more of it I've ""gotten.""",1475539200,,1017,4.605555555555555

I had no idea that this was occurring, although tanks rumbling through the streets at all hours of the day and night was not the norm in the United States. Some things are somewhat out of place. Like there were lots and lots of bullet holes in the buildings that were still apparent then. That was not part of this drama, so really inconsequentially absent. But the spirits of the German people had as many bullet scars in them. Just as the people in the southern United States had for generations after the civil war.

historical context of watching the Berlin Wall being built and the emotional catharsis of being stuck behind it. Wondered about the reality of
the spies. You fall in love with the traitor that Hank defends and wondered if that was a sympathetic Hollywood making you love him or if he was like that in real life. Want to research more about him. Sooooo many levels in this movie, excellent discussion movie afterwards. Have a party and watch it and serve a ""big American breakfast"" with it.

Hope I didn't give too much away. It intrigued me to even look up who is this James Donovan a man of such integrity. I plan to buy it as my blu ray collection well worth every penny!

It has a great story, celebrates Tom Hanks talent as an outstanding actor, and it is a fascinating testimony of what Spielbergs ability of directing can achieve: wonderfully and meticulously arranged scenes create magic and suspense by artistically combining every aspect and craft involved in filmmaking. So, this amazing movie comes along as a captivating Renaissance/Baroque painting that powerfully makes use of light and shadow, skilfully matches the settings with the characters personalities and experiences, uses symbolism, subtle psychological amplifiers and realism in an elegantly arranged balance. It is a visceral dance based on the strong emotional undercurrents of the story that is presented with a delicate sense of timing. To me, in this motion picture, everything converged into a masterpiece: the grand, ancient tradition of storytelling presented as a multidimensional, interdisciplinary modern-day art form.",1470873600,,949,5.83453237410072

Mark Rylance gave the outstanding performance as the mild-mannered, beautifully understated soviet spy, Rudolf Abel, and Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance as James Donovan. The only drawback for me was that the real story was amazing and inspiring all on its own, so I was sorry that Spiellberg felt it necessary to embellish at least in a couple of scenes to heighten the viewer's emotional response. I would have liked for Frederic Pryor's father to be at Checkpoint Charlie when his son was released (as he was). However, the story does convey the courage it had to have taken to stand up for what is right despite the critical pressure that stance may provoke. Bridge of Spies  is a gripping story, well worth viewing.",1470528000,,842,4.929577464788732

7438025,5,B015HM3E8K,"Tom Hanks plays Brooklyn lawyer James Donovan who gets drawn into the Cold War. He is selected by the bar association to represent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a Soviet spy active in New York City. Donovan was chosen because no one wanted to defend Abel. Being an honest, honorable, and precise man, Donovan gives Abel the best defense he can, in spite of encouragement from family and the firm to get it done as quickly as possible. Donovan builds a little friendship with Abel, enough to find out that the U. S. government did try to get information from Abel or turn him into a double agent. Abel keeps quiet and refuses to cooperate, telling Donovan that the Americans have men just like Abel in Russia doing the same thing. The evidence is fairly overwhelming and the judge is completely unsympathetic, so the guilty verdict is no surprise.

Meanwhile, the U2 spy plane program has started. American pilots in Pakistan are flying U2 planes at 70,000 feet over Soviet airspace, taking pictures of facilities and other locations of interest to the U. S. Government. One of the planes is shot down and the pilot, Francis Gary Powers, is captured by the Soviets. Powers goes through a quick trial to parade him in front of cameras, showing how evil America is.

The two stories intersect when Donovan receives a letter from East Germany. Someone claiming to be Abel's wife has written and is hinting that they are willing to trade Powers for Abel. Donovan is drawn into the negotiations as an unofficial representative of the U. S. Government. That means he has to travel to Berlin just as the Berlin Wall is being constructed. An American graduate student is caught behind the eastern side of the wall and is held by the communist East German government. Donovan decides he wants to trade Abel for both Powers and the student, though the respective governments are not interested in extra complications. What follows is an exciting struggle by Donovan to get both the Americans home.

The movie is a sort of Cold War version of High Noon. Donovan is a man of integrity and uprightness, even in the face of social pressure to do the expedient and shallowly patriotic thing (either letting Abel go to the electric chair like the Rosenbergs did or accepting just Powers and not the student too). While he agrees the Cold War is a war of cultures, he insists that the Americans hold to their principles, like due process for Abel and protecting all lives including the student's. Otherwise, how is American culture different from Soviet culture?

Donovan is also intelligent and disciplined, able to read situations and either coax or strong-arm others into doing the right thing. Often, such actions are not convenient for Donovan but he does them anyway. He's an inspiring character.

Highly recommended!",1467763200,,2803,4.843423799582464

7438117,4,B015HM3E8K,"Believe it or not, the master of cinematic wonder is still working strong. Steven Spielberg has met few close encounters towards failure in his career, but any time he did fail, he always got himself back up with his next project. We all know that he has recently met terrific success with the Civil War biopic Lincoln, and the World War I biopic War Horse, so now his big artistic success this time is the Cold War biopic Bridge of Spies. Noticing a theme here?

The big Spiels 28th feature tells about lawyer James B. Donovans (Tom Hanks) war on the worlds as he defends Rudolf Abel, the top spy of the Soviet Union. We see how he used this relationship to rescue a CIA pilot from the USSR, saving a life and in turn, the world entire. Does this story of the remarkable man of influence in the Cold War achieve what it needed to accomplish?

For the most part, yes. Steven Spielberg continues his line of smartly selected stories told as a wonderful tribute to the events depicted. As the unpredictable moments of Donovans journey hooks you in, you can feel his real life family brimming with smiles from the detail of the way that this Bronx lawyer and his accomplishments are highlighted. It is all done with the usual elements of a Spielberg film: blaring backlights, issues between a patriarchal father and his family, and explicit focus put on complex editing and cinematography techniques. Yet these trademarks of his vision are so subtle that you would even believe that this movie could have been directed by anybody.

But note how I above said for the most part. There are still a number of drawbacks that prevent this film from becoming a timeless classic that falls under Spielbergs long resume. While the films first half introduces character, conflict and setting flawlessly, the latter half drags with over usage of the Cold War vocabulary that would be difficult for the average IQ to comprehend. So if you did not live during the 1950s, and if you are unfamiliar with terms such as CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot or, KGB intelligence officer, and if the mechanics of the Soviet Union between Russia and the US are completely foreign to you, prepare to be horribly confused while thinking, 141 minutes. Why did it have to be 141 minutes?

Bridge of Spies is simply not a very personal filmodd since Steven Spielberg has been famously known for how much of himself he transpires to the public. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial was a direct reflection of the divorce of his parents. Schindlers List stemmed directly from his Jewish roots. Saving Private Ryan was a tribute to his father. Bridge of Spies is merely a historical account from a point of history that Spielberg never felt many strong feelings towards.

While the films authoritative power many not been as strong as it could have been, a great round of applause should be made for the technical writing of Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (Fargo, No Country for Old Men). This threesome opened the park with meticulous research done on every character and situation in this dense study on the Cold Wars meaning.

For the cinema bluffs out there, they should know that this movie, much like Spielbergs many other works with his usual editor Michael Khan (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark), makes for some highly provocative editing techniques. For instance, when Donovan is sitting in at the first of his court hearings to defend Abel, the judge makes the court stand for the pledge of allegiance. Immediately, the frame cuts to an elementary school classroom stating the pledge of allegiance, leading into a documentary on Russias nuclear bomb threat. The images of the documentary scar the kids pretty badly, one of them being Donovans son, who later at home learns that hell need a bigger bathtub as he fills his to the rim to preserve water in case the Russians did strike. Such a brief moment, and yet it marks such a wonderful touch of reality that sets the stage for the time.

But what is a winning set of filming techniques without a far more triumphant cast? The leading man Tom Hanks (Cast Away, Forrest Gump) plays the same natural strong-willed authoritative figure that is expected from an actor of his range. It is not the best of his career, but he still brings across precisely what was needed for the role without any hint of overplaying. Mark Rylance (Angels and Insects, Wolf Hall) also puts on an awards worthy performance as the Russian spy Rudolf Abel, and he even gets his moment of glory in a gorgeously paced monologue by the turning point between the first and second acts.

You know whats really sad about this film? It proves that Schindlers List was both the best and worst thing to happen to Spielbergs career. While it did show the world that he finally matured as an artist, none of his works after that, excluding one, became instant classics. Bridge of Spies is simply another addition to the batch. Yet even so, this film is an excellent display for the politically savvy viewer of what a finely tuned picture should look like, especially for those independent producers who are seeking to improve their art.

7438262,5,B015HM3E8K,"This film is based on the FBI ""hollow nickel"" case. I liked this film despite its poetic licence with history. Donovan did not go to the judge's house to plead against Abel's execution - that was done in court, his home was never attacked, his coat was never stolen, he did not witness people being shot in attempting to scale the Berlin Wall and there was no Pryor's girlfriend. However, I didn't feel that those little fibs detracted from the film narrative. The ""stolen coat"" is a metaphor for Donovan's being closely watched. What I did find jarring was the scene in which Power's plane was shot down and his valiant attempt to reach the Destruct lever. That said, this is the story of a master negotiator, a seasoned deal maker who doesn't blink, and his dour, stoic and loyal client who chooses to wait on the bridge so that Donovan can get his other man. Hank's performance was great, but Mark Rylance was captivating, spell binding. His telling of the ""standing man"" story from his childhood was superb. This is not a film for action lovers - the magic is in the dialogue, the story, the characters, the settings, the ethics. Listen carefully as Donovan finds his way through the maze of competing political positions and deceptions, builds his case, bit by bit, outmanoeuvres his adversaries and holds his nerve. The ""three endings"" tied off the threads of duty, family, and ethics. The unspoken, smiling approval of the woman on the train, reading about the exchange of prisoners, subtly reflects the country's growing approval of Donovan, previously despised for defending Abel.",1464998400,,1589,4.845588235294118

7438327,4,B015HM3E8K,"I was actually surprised that I liked this movie! I was expecting the movie to be similar to something that I've seen countless times in other movies, but it was not. Tom Hanks does wonderfully in his performance as Donovan, the insurance attorney that must broker the deal between the Russians and Americans. The supporting cast is likewise excellent. If there is a downside to this movie, it would be that it doesn't move quickly and focuses more on the content of dialogue and acting, but this is probably the case since the movie is a drama (I don't watch too many of these). Overall, though, an excellent film.",1464566400,,615,4.651376146788991

7438331,5,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies is a Steven Spielberg-directed spy thriller that stars Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Austin Stowell, and Will Rogers. It tells the true story of how an obscure New York lawyer is recruited to negotiate an exchange of spies between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Four men are at the center of this fascinating and well-told story. Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is a Soviet intelligence agent working in New York City. In 1957, the FBI arrests Abel for espionage. He is quickly tried and convicted of the charges. Abels defense lawyer is James Donovan (Hanks), who previously had been requested for the job. Donovan reluctantly agrees to defend Abel. With all the anti-communist hysteria surrounding the case, he knows that its pretty much a foregone conclusion that Abel will be convicted. About the best Donovan can hope for is to convince the hard-nosed trial judge not to give his client a death sentence.

The third and fourth men in this story are Francis Gary Powers (Stowell) and Frederic Pryor (Rogers), two Americans serving time in separate prisons behind the Iron Curtain. Powers is a U-2 pilot working for the CIA. He had been shot down while flying over the Soviet Union. Pryor is a graduate student studying in Berlin, who just happens to be on the wrong side of the infamous wall then under construction. Their cases are about to become linked in a high stakes game of power politics between the worlds greatest superpowers

Re-enter James Donovan. The CIA recruits him to go into Berlin  by himself, and with no government backing  to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. The CIA wants an Abel for Powers-only swap. But on his own, Donovan decides to negotiate a two-for-one exchange: Abel for Powers AND Pryor

How will the CIA and the governments of the Soviet Union and East Germany react?  What will be the outcome? And what dangers does Donovan face while scurrying about in Berlin in search of a deal?  Watch this great film to find out

I really enjoyed Bridge of Spies. The film had just the right amount of tension to make it a first-rate spy thriller. As one might expect, all the actors are at the top of their game  especially Mark Rylance, who won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his superb acting. Tom Hanks turns in another in a long line of outstanding, polished  performances as James Donovan.

Bridge of Spies is one of the best films of 2015, and one of my new favorites.. Highly recommended.",1464480000,4,2450,4.752358490566038

7438395,5,B015HM3E8K,"This has got to be one of the best films that capture the Cold War era of the 1950s.  Many of us who were children at the time can identify with Donovan's little boy who has filled up the bathtub and is lecturing his dad on why they should have a plan for the next drop of the atomic bomb in NYC!  What scary times!  I also remember seeing films of how to build a bomb shelter, what happens during a nuclear explosion, and  how we all need to be prepared.

Tom Hanks as Jim Donovan, the attorney that represented Colonel Abel, the Russian man convicted of espionage, did an excellent job portraying him.  The idea that Donovan had the foresight to recommend that this spy be spared execution because of a possible exchange in the future was brilliant!  How people reacted to the verdict was also predictable as WWII had ended, people lost relatives or had fought in this terrible war, and the thought of letting this man escape without paying the ultimate price was unthinkable.

Watching Donovan negotiate the release of two captives---one an American student in East Berlin and the other an American pilot were tense moments.  His ability to convince the Russians and East Germans to let both of these men go took someone of extraordinary bargaining skills.  And this guy was an insurance lawyer by profession!

The cinematography, especially the scenes of East Berlin, the Wall, and the representation of what happened to those who tried to climb over was well done and was overwhelmingly sad.  The bitter cold and the scene where Jim Donovan is accosted by some rough looking German young adults who end up stealing his coat was pretty intense!

This is a movie that will be appreciated by anyone who grew up in the Cold War era.  For those that didn't,  it's still an education and a history lesson about why Socialism and Communism are really not all they are cracked up to be!",1463702400,2,1883,4.612612612612613

It begins in 1957 when America and Russia fear each other and hunt for spies. One man paints a self-portrait. His phone rings and he leaves. This is set in Brooklyn. Who is following him? The artist picks up a hidden item, then returns home to access the hidden message. G-Men break into his flat, question him, and search his rooms. Mr. Donovan is called to a meeting, they want him to defend an accused Soviet spy. Its a patriotic duty. Abel tells how he was offered money to work as a double agent. Donovan tells of his background. Do not talk to anybody else about your case. [Always good advice.] Then we meet Lt. Gary Francis Powers. He and others are selected for a mission that must be kept secret at all times. Lawyer Donovan asks for more time to prepare. [The too dark scenes make it hard to note the details.] He will not violate attorney client privileges.

In Pakistan the drivers are introduced to the article. It will take pictures from 70,000 feet, 2,000 square miles at a time. Was there a search warrant for what the FBI found? This rule goes back to 1886, even for an illegal immigrant. School children are exposed to warnings about nuclear warfare. [Mental conditioning?] Donovans son believes the newspaper reports. The jury votes guilty on all counts. Donovan asks for this to be set aside based on the weight of evidence. Abel is not afraid to die, but it wouldnt be his first choice. Abel tells about his past, his parents beating by partisan guards. Donovan talks to the judge at his home, he wants Abel kept alive. The judge sentences him to thirty years. [Did others meet the judge?] People object to this! Donovan will appeal. Shots are fired into Donovans home! [The Right to Keep and Bear Arms was operational even in Brooklyn then.] He will get protections. The drivers get instructions on destroying the article, and themselves. Spend the dollar. Donovan argues before the Supreme Court, using the analogy to the military.

In 1960 Lt. Powers U-2 was shot down by a rocket. He cannot hit the destruct button. The news carries misinformation about a weather plane that went off-course. The appeal by Donovan is denied. In the USSR Powers is sentenced to prison. Allen Dulles learns about the letter from East Germany. Will there be a prisoner exchange? Donovan must go to East Berlin to negotiate; will he? The Berlin Wall is built (to control immigration). Donovan will go to Europe on a routine business trip. The US wants Powers out, Donovan gets instructions. Young men give Donovan directions and take his overcoat! Donovan meets Abels relatives, then an official, to explain the exchange. Prisoner Powers is questioned about details on his article, but he knows little. Donovan continues his negotiations for Powers and Pryor. They meet at the Glienicke Bridge early in the morning. Abel is unemotional; he can wait. Then the exchange of items is made. Donovan returns home. The news tells of the exchange. Abels sentence was commuted by the President, so it was all legal. Donovan was later sent to Cuba to negotiate the release of 9,703 men, women, and children. [No mention of later events.]

This is more of a history lesson not entertainment, so it is not dramatic. It runs on too long and has too many dark scenes. Few will remember these events from nearly sixty years ago, so this is worth watching. Abel seems to have been a courier who gathered reports from other spies for retransmission without knowing much about the source. This is done so the identities remain hidden. Machines (satellites) have replace humans in reconnaissance. As I remember it, Powers did not use the destruct button because it would have caused an instantaneous explosion to eliminate everything. This was not done in WW II to protect the Norden bombsight.",1463097600,,3808,4.773899848254931

I've always been a Tom Hanks fan and I thought he did a decent job in this movie. I thought he portrayed the character very well despite the Hollywood effect on the actual true story of which the movie is inspired from.

Language wasn't overly terrible and there were no sex scenes, but there is a scene where someone is shot and killed, which will be too graphic for children.

Overall a decent movie and one I wouldn't mind watching again. However, don't fully believe everything in this movie as fact. If you want to know the actual story, just do a little research and you'll see the differences.",1462147200,,849,4.5

7438491,4,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies tells the story of a US-USSR prisoner exchange at the height of the Cold War in the early 1960s. The film is based partly on the James B. Donovans memoir Strangers on a Bridge (1964) and features an all-star creative team. It was written by Joel and Ethan Coen and Matt Charman and directed by Stephen Spielberg. In 1960, a man calling himself Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested in New York on suspicion of espionage for the Soviet Union. The Brooklyn Bar Association approaches James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who worked on the Nuremberg trials, to represent Abel in court out of concern that the US give the appearance of a fair trial. Donovan accepts in spite of his wifes reservations and earnestly tries to protect Abels civil liberties, not knowing that his involvement in the case will lead him deep into Cold War intrigue.

The details are not all accurate, but Bridge of Spies provides drama and an outline of what happened when the two Cold War superpowers held each others countrymen and wanted them back. Mutual mistrust and East Germanys independent agenda made negotiations over the fate of Rudolf Abel and American U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) difficult. The film largely tells the story from Donovans point of view; hes the hero. But it gives the audiences snippets of the early days of the U2 spy plane program, which would fly into Soviet airspace to take aerial photographs, because the two storylines eventually collide. Very much in the Hollywood style, filmmakers went out of their way to make Powers young, dashing, and handsome.

This is a solid Hollywood-style drama, with a few incongruities. Abel was a communist ideologue and loyal Soviet who had been an important intelligence agent during World War II. He is presented in the film as being a realist, almost a fatalist, with a very subdued personality. I don't know if the conversations depicted in the film are accurate. As written, Abel didn't impress me as an ideologue. Just the opposite. Tom Hanks has made a career playing low-key everyman protagonists, the flip side of the same coin as Harrison Ford, who made a career playing everyman action heroes. But James Donovan was in his early 40s when these events took place, and Tom Hanks is conspicuously older. Tom Hanks is good in the role, but Hollywood needs to start thinking about who is going to fill his shoes. With an undeniable Hollywood gloss, the film is entertaining and thoughtful.",1462060800,,2481,4.862884160756501

Hanks was (as usual) great as the official go-between of the spy swap. Even though we all knew how this turned out, the film was so well-directed, acted and scripted, that the viewer became lost in the intrigue.

Many Americans are unaware that East Berlin existed for many years after the end of WW II as a ""movie set"" with buildings on the main street, Unter den Linden, mere facades with nothing behind them but bombed out rubble. It would have been easy for the film to gloss over that fact, but it truly depicted the situation. The tenseness between the Russians and the East German police was real and it's a miracle that the swap was completed without incident. Great movie.

7438553,5,B015HM3E8K,"This is an excellent movie.  The middle and late fifties were very bleak times in terms of politics.  Many of us may have had some good times back then, but the tension of the 'cold war' was difficult for those of us who were aware.  I can recall the 'duck and cover' drills as well as retreats to the basement of our school building.  We heard something about 'civil defense,' but much of these exercises was mysterious.  The development, regarding the Soviet ""spy,"" superbly played by Mark Rylance,  was gripping.  After his initial court hearing, the overall plot comes on perhaps too quick, as Powers comes  conveniently into the picture  (as I knew in advance basically what to expent).  With terrific acting, the covert, nasty 'intelligence' issues are unnerving, especially understanding that these games are still routine among many nations.",1461542400,,849,5.0

7438555,5,B015HM3E8K,"The feel of this movie is just right.  It transports you back to a simpler, yet more uncertain, time during the Cold War years.  I have an affection for the setting and the backdrop as it reminds me so much of my childhood.  All the details are intricately accurate from the cars to the homes, clothing styles, television sets, dinner tables, etc.  The film looks as though it was shot in 1957!  Plus Spielberg knows how to use the camera to frame things and keep you engaged.  In the hands of any other director, the film would have suffered.  Instead, we're given a terrific drama that keeps you mesmerized.  It mixes the right amount of humor, action, historical accuracy, drama, and suspense.",1461542400,,696,4.647540983606557

7438557,5,B015HM3E8K,"PLOT: Lawyer Donovan defends Commy Spy Rudolf Abel~ and later....helps trade him for downed U2 Pilot Francis Gary Powers~ 5 STAR all the way.

1957~ We see a mousy little man painting in NY City~ he is clearly being followed and watched~ he also picks up a DEADDROP coin hidden under his bench. He goes back to his shabby apartment where is opens the coin and a message in code is hidden inside.. Soon FBI and CIA break down his door and arrest him for being a ""Commy Spy"".....The man is Rudolph Abel and is not everyone's idea of a spy from being small and elderly to his over sided glasses. But he is clever enough to ask to clean up his paints and at the same time destroys the message by globing paint on it while the FBI /CIA search his apartment for Clues........ Enter Jim Donovan (TOM HANKS) an insurance investigator who helped prosecute Nazis at Nuremberg. He is appointed as the Public Defender for Spy Abel. Donovan is stuck being the SECOND most hated man in America AFTER Abel. He puts up a good defense but the Communist Scare at the time only helps convict Abel. Donovan suggests to the judge that Abel might be later ""exchanged"" and is a valuable asset since he is a Colonel in the KGB. Pilot Francis Gary Powers is part of the Ultra Secret U2 flights over Russia to spy from the air using high tech cameras to film and collect info from the USSR. Powers is shot down and is soon being interrogated. A Communist ""show trial"" has him convicted and in prison for years for being a Spy against the USSR /Russia.  A Letter from East Germany arrives for Abel at Donovan's Law office~ and begins  the ""plot"" to exchange Abel for Powers is soon being planned.  Donovan is the Key ~He is the 'go between'...between the Communists and the Americans and the East Germans where the exchange is to take place~~ Donovan gets the run around in East Germany~ and realizes he is a pawn between the Soviets and the East Germans both hoping to trade someone for Abel. Donovan decides he has had enough and turns the tables. The East Germans are attempting to gain POWER in this deal~ Added to the mix is a third American prisoner Donovan ""demands"" Both American Prisoners for Abel. and the Bridge of Spies from East Germany to West along with the Russians takes place. Hanks is first rate as the man who always does the right thing. HISTORICAL FOLLOW UP ON DONOVAN~JFK used Donovan again to later broker a deal with CASTRO to exchange ""money and humanitarian aid"" for Prisoners from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. this is an excellent movie. This story unfolds and shows the Commy Scare times of the late 1950s in America complete with Drills for Atom Bomb Attacks ~ also watch the Bonus feature on this DVD with behind the scenes from Hanks and Speilberg. 5 STARS~ and scene stealer here is Abel (MARK RYLANCE) as the spy who knows everything but tells nothing and the emerging respect he has for Donovan. This movie is based on real life events and the Bio of Donovan.",1461542400,,2962,4.479629629629629

It's based on a real-life story about negotiations.  But they're not very long ones.  There's a lot of what feels like padding.  I mean yeah, it establishes the stakes and tone and sets the scene.  But it's also too much of the movie, IMO.
I was pretty inspired and loved these characters, so it sure did something right.  But still, it's a quieter piece of history and the movie reflects that for better or worse.  If you want excitement, this may not be for you.  But if you want to see Tom Hanks do what he does, show you the power of conscience, it delivers exactly that.  I'm on the fence between 3 and 4 stars.",1461369600,,891,4.301204819277109

Truly a great movie with a great cast and amazing director of course and writers.  So if you need a great movie that makes you think and make time go by fast then this is the movie for you to watch and enjoy every moment of it, Hanks performance ranks up there with Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, and so forth.  In closing well worth the money and I would tell all my friends, family, and other people I know to check this movie out or just buy it out right, well worth the DVD collection addition.",1460764800,,865,4.100591715976331

James 'Jim' Donovan, an insurance attorney, is asked to defend purported Soviet Spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law.  Upon reading a guilty verdict Donovan speaks to the sentencing judge asking that the death penalty be taken off the table in hopes of using Abel as a potential future bargaining chip.  At the same time the CIA is recruiting U-2 pilots from the Air Force.  Enter Francis Gary Powers.  Exit Powers, if you know what I mean.

The rest of the movie centers on Donovan's attempt to not only trade Abel for Powers with the Soviets but trade Abel for incarcerated Berlin University student American Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) with the East Germans who have recently erected the Berlin Wall and are trying desparately to be seen as a legitimate government by the U.S.

Why waste words when they might distract from the visual epic cinematography? For Spielberg, the moral and political complexities involved in the characters' actions, are far too murky and far less attractive to be truly dealt with. The paranoia and xenophobia  which penetrate both sides of the cold war are barely mentioned before quickly passed on to introduce another cinematic moment. How did each of the exchanged parties fare by their colleagues, their families and the public? Were they revered or reviled, and for what reasons?  And how did they see themselves? We never get more than a glimpse into the minds of the real two (or three) dramatic characters. Looking back - Is there any part we could or should be ashamed of in the way the pilot was treated?

7438713,5,B015HM3E8K,"A fun script, inspiring story, and great performances made this probably my favorite rental of the year.  Tom Hanks is in his wheelhouse as conscientious Everyman James B. Donovan, who is somehow deadly serious about doing the right thing without taking himself too seriously.  In fact, I think this is the character's key feature, as his affable nature and keen intelligence play against the Cold War background of dark and affected gravitas on both sides of the Iron Curtain to amazing effect, making for several wonderful laugh-out-loud moments in a film that was played entirely straight.  A great commentary on how ludicrous and shallow the greatest and deadliest of human conflicts can be, while also warming the heart and reminding us that we can make a difference.",1459987200,,772,5.062992125984252

7438719,5,B015HM3E8K,"I have always had a weakness for the Cold War espionage stories and the players involved in them. The Glienicke Bridge in particular, is a critical part of this lore. The bridge linked West Berlin and communist East Germany's city of Potsdam. This was where the East and the West traded their spies in exchange.  These exchanges started soon after  the Berlin Wall came up and continued all the way up to the collapse of Communism in 1990. This movie is about the first-ever such exchange made on this bridge in 1962. The USSR traded the U2-fighter pilot Gary Powers in return for their spy Rudolf Abel.  The film is a wonderful thriller, albeit in a moody, low-key way. It is devoid of any action-packed chases or gun-induced violence.  Still, it emerges as a  gripping drama,  enriched by the personalities of Rudolf Abel and his Defence lawyer John Donovan. It is yet another good one from Steven Spielberg.

The story unfolds with the FBI capturing Rudolph Abel in NYC and charging him as a Soviet spy. The US decides to appoint John Donovan, an insurance lawyer in NYC, to act as Abel's defence lawyer. Donovan's expected role was rather modest. He just needed to show that even spies get 'fair play' in the US. This was supposed to be in contrast to the 'summary executions' which take place in the USSR under similar circumstances.  But, Donovan tries in earnest, even though his defence of Abel fails in the Supreme Court. In the charged atmosphere of the 1960s, a clamour rises for sentencing Abel to death. Everyone from the presiding judges to the ordinary man on the street wants it. The public denounces Donovan for defending a Soviet spy. Donovan ignores all the criticism and argues with the judge to reduce the sentence to life. With great foresight, he suggests that it may be useful to keep Abel alive in US' own interests. There might arise a situation where the USSR takes an American as prisoner. A living Abel would be useful in exchanging him for the American. Just as Murphy's law dictates, Gary Powers, a young American pilot, flies an U2 spy plane over the USSR and is shot down. The Russians capture him as a spy. Following this, a second American also gets arrested in East Berlin.  He was Frederic Pryor,  a 23-year old student, who finds himself on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. The CIA enters the picture and asks Donovan to negotiate on behalf of the US for a prisoner exchange. Cold-War pride dictates that the US cannot acknowledge that such negotiations are taking place.  So, there will not be any overt support from the administration. The rest of the film follows the efforts of Donovan in a cold East German winter.  He negotiates with the Soviet apparatchiks as well as the CIA. We see the ugly side of the CIA. False ideological pride makes American officials to focus only on Powers' release.  They feel that Pryor would complicate the Abel-Powers exchange and argue with Donovan to ignore Frederic Pryor in this negotiation. But Donovan would have none of it.  He would negotiate only for the simultaneous release of both Americans for Abel. In this, he finds a most unlikely ally in Rudolf Abel. It all converges towards a fascinating ending.

It is refreshing to see the subject of a Soviet spy treated without jingoism. The screenplay shows Donovan arguing that Abel is an honorable man. He doesn't reveal any intelligence under interrogation. He does exactly what the US  itself would expect of its own spies. The film shows that even in the 1960s, there was the desire to condemn Abel without trial. After all, it was the time when Joe McCarthy and the Rosenbergs were recent memories. But, Donovan emphasizes  the importance of 'due process as per the Constitution' in Abel's trial. And it is interesting to see that he managed to prevail when paranoia was still rampant. It is tempting to see the film as a commentary on the conduct of the US in this era of being the sole superpower. Today, we have mass surveillance on law-abiding citizens. We have the endorsement of torture of prisoners in the name of 'containing Terrorism'. But the 'Red Peril' of the 1960s was so much more dangerous and powerful than a bunch of fanatical terrorists. Still, it was not possible then to tap a phone call without a court order. Nor was it possible for the State to open our mails without due permission.

Mark Rylance, the British actor, plays the role of Abel and he is just magnificent.  In the long opening sequence of the film, the FBI agents trail him and arrest him in his drab and dreary flat. Here, Rylance plays Abel as a consummate, smooth, unperturbed spy with great skill. In the courtroom, we see an Abel who is subdued, inscrutable and devoted to his cause and principles. The courtroom action moves on and the threat of a  death sentence hovers over his head. Here, we see an Abel with quiet humor and a philosophical detachment. He is excellent in the final scene on the Glienicke bridge as well. Tom Hanks, as John Donovan, gives another excellent performance.  He brings the nondescript insurance lawyer into a real-life hero figure.

It is one of the best films I have seen recently.",1459900800,,5145,4.699666295884316

Andrews Blu-ray Review: BRIDGE OF SPIES [2015] is a truly finely magnificent crafted, beautifully acted spy thriller film that offers the viewer intrigue, mystery and danger. Its based on a true story and some of the key points of the film were shot on the very locations where the incidents took place.

Tom Hanks portrays lawyer James B. Donovan who is asked to take on a criminal case and even though he hasn't done so for years. This one is important though, so he agrees, even though he knows it will make him the second most vilified man in America. The most vilified is the man hes representing Rudolf Abel [Mark Rylance] a man who is believed to be a Russian spy, despite his British accent and home base in Germany.

Mark Rylance turns in a total awe inspiring excellent performance, worthy of his Awards, understated performance of a quiet, unassuming man whose main hobby is painting. Thats just what hes doing when the Feds bust in to his apartment and arrest him. He quietly complies, and when he meets Rudolf Abel for the first time, he is just as quiet and compliant, despite the fact that hes facing the electric chair. As he tells Rudolf Abel numerous times, Would worrying help? James B. Donovan grows to like Rudolf Abel, who, if a threat to the United States seems docile and meek.

This is set during the Cold War, a time when director Steven Spielberg was growing up, and he really nails the emotion of the time period and the sentiment among Americans. They were terrified that a bomb would drop on the United States of America that would kill them all, or at the very least, deprive them of basic necessities, such as water. James B. Donovans son, after watching an instructional film at school as to what to do if the Soviets drop a bomb, is terrified and fills the bathtub full of water in preparation. The rest of America is just as on edge, and when James B. Donovan accepts Rudolf Abels case, his entire family becomes a target.

Tom Hanks brings a quiet strength to his character where James B. Donovan is a moral man who cares very much about the welfare of other people. He doesnt see Rudolf Abel as a threat, but as a man doing what his country ordered him to do. Rudolf Abel believes lives are more important than politics and his persistence plays a very big role in what comes about when an American pilot Francis Gary Powers [Austin Stowell] is captured by Russia, and Frederic Pryor [Will Rogers] a young American man studying in Germany is taken into custody just as the Berlin wall is going up.

Theres a scene at the end, when James B. Donovan is on a train, that mirrors an earlier moment he had on a train while in Europe. James B. Donovan saw something horrifying and what he spots brings back that memory. Its a brilliant, moving way to end the film, and while watching, I wondered if it was the brainchild of the screenwriters or the director. It was neither. While watching the bonus features, I learned that Tom Hanks came up with the idea and presented it to Steven Spielberg, who liked it and agreed to end the film that way. So all in all this is a totally amazing spy thriller film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, even though you know the final outcome.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox and DreamWorks presents this amazing Blu-ray disc with feast for all your senses, that is abounding in clarity that far exceeds the theatrical presentation of the film. All elements of all planes of every image are in constant focus. Colours, particularly the blacks and blues, are luscious, nearly viscous, suggesting tangible extra dimensions within the frame. Whites often affirm the film's theme of truth as existing in shards, splintering images, especially the white light reflecting off of the heavy rain in a notably expressionist chase scene. Textures are tactile, from the coats worn by the characters to the various tools of espionage used by agents to the gears and gadgets within the U-2 plane.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox and DreamWorks presents this amazing Blu-ray disc with a totally brilliant awe inspiring 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack aurally complements the hyper-detail of the imagery, often abounding in subtle exaggerations of everyday noises: of a rumbling train jostling riders on their daily commute, of the aforementioned raindrops hitting the pavement, of feet tramping across a shabby floor, of a spy delicately removing a razor to open a hidden piece of information. This presentation celebrates the beauty of exacting density.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: A Case of the Cold War: Bridge of Spies [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [17:45] Filled with archival footage/audio, interviews with the actors, director, writer, historian and the real people from the story, this is the first of the features to serve as a history lesson for the real events and shows what was happening in the world in the late 1950s, when there was tension between Russia and the U.S.A and there was a very real threat of war. Francis Gary Powers Jr. talks about his fathers beginnings and how he became a pilot. With American student Frederic L. Pryor reveals what he went through in East Germany when the Berlin wall went up. We discover that Francis Gary Powers trial is re-enacted in the film word for word from the actual trial. Following Rudolph Abel return to Russia, to be reunited with his wife and daughter, Rudolph Abel was never publicity acknowledged by the Soviet Union as a spy. Francis Gary Powers died in a helicopter crash in 1977, while working for KNBC News. Francis Gary Powers were posthumously awarded the CIA Directors Medal and the USAF POW Medal in 2000 and the Silver Star in 2012. In 1962, Frederic L. Pryor received his Ph. D. in Economics from Yale University and now Frederic L. Pryor is currently Professor Emeritus of Economics and Senior Research Scholar of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Following the successful conclusion of the Powers-Abel exchange, James B. Donovan was asked by President John F. Kennedy to undertake further negotiations on behalf of the U.S.A. In the summers of 1962, James B. Donovan was sent to Cuba to discuss with Fidel Castro the terms of the release of 1,113 prisoners held after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. When James B. Donovan finished negotiations, James B. Donovan secured the release of 9,703 men, women and children.

Special Feature: Berlin 1961: Re-Creating the Divide [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [11:35] Kicking off with a history lesson of the time, this feature explains how the Berlin locations were re-created in actual Berlin and how many of the actual locations were re-dressed to match the time. Tom Hanks talks about the historical aspect of filming in East Germany where the actual events took place. Archive footage of the time shows young people trying to get through barbed wire to get to freedom. American technical consultant Jane R. Helmchen, who worked in West Germany as a teacher just after the wall was built, talks about how difficult it was to get through to East Germany from West Germany at the time. We see how parts of East Berlin were recreated for the film, because modern day Berlin is much too different now, and Marc Platt [Producer] says that they located to the Polish town Wroc'aw, that they found to have Berlin 1961 architecture that was totally perfect to recreating Berlin in 1961. Near the end of this special feature you see Tom Hanks on the New York Subway travelling to work and Tom Hanks looks out of the window to see young men jumping over fences in some different neighbours back gardens, and the same time you see young men and women trying to climb over the Berlin Wall and being shot by the East German Guards, which Tom Hanks suggested to director Steven Spielberg, who thought it was a perfect solution and to actually see this near the end of the film.

Special Feature: U-2 Spy Plane [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:45] With full D.O.D. cooperation, actual U-2 spy planes were used for the film's shoot l. The ground and take-off footage was captured with fully functional and still-in-use U-2 planes. The in-flight stunt sequences were obviously shot with mechanised set pieces and a CGI backdrop, which is also shown in this feature. This gives you a look at what it took to film the scenes involving the pilots. Francis Gary Powers Jr. reveals that he worked as a technical consultant as well as an extra on the film and was very proud to honour his Father, Francis Gary Powers and Francis Gary Powers Jr. comments that this film is a great legacy for future generations, in knowing what actual happened in those dark days in 1961s Cold War scenario. In a rare audio voice over, his Father, Francis Gary Powers, describes what happened within his plane after he was shot down.

Special Feature: Spy Swap: Looking Back on the Final Act [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:42] Here with the film's climax, we witness the actual location where we have the prisoner exchange scene was filmed on the Glienicke Bridge (the so-called ""Bridge of Spies""), where the historical exchange actually took place in 1962. The bridge spans the Havel narrows between Berlin and Potsdam, and was closed to traffic for filming over the last weekend of November. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the set to watch the filming of these scenes. Principal photography officially ended on December 4, at Berlin Tempelhof, where it unfolded and see how the location was shot to make the bridge become more than just a location setting, but a character within the film. The bridge swap is re-enacted on the actual bridge where the exchange took place. Once again we hear a rare voice recording of Francis Gary Powers talking about being imprisoned in Russia. Francis Gary Powers Jr. reveals to us that his Father, Francis Gary Powers wasn't aware of what was being reported about him at the time in the U.S.A. press and some were saying that he had defected and told the Russians all the information he knew about the technical details of the U-2 Spy Plane, and was planning to live there, none of which was true. Frederick L. Pryor informs us about the actual real time in 1961 when he was going to be swapped at the same time as Rudolph Abel, but in reality had to sit in the car for hours and was not informed on what was going on., especially with the East German authorities. All in all, this was quite a fascinating and interesting special feature, especially seeing the behind-the-scenes of the last days of shooting the BRIDGE OF SPIES film, in recreating the actual event on the historic Berlin bridge.

Special Feature: Credits [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:03] This particular item is entitled BRIDGE OF SPIES DOCUMENTARIES and it gives complete information on all the people who were involved with the four special feature documentaries.

Finally, BRIDGE OF SPIES [2015] is a totally grippingly engrossing and expressive espionage yarn, another exemplary entry in Steven Spielberg's late-career period, receives a top-tier, must-buy transfer. What makes it great is that it's an entirely perfect package. From the acting, the directing to writing, the lighting, and every single aspect of it is totally flawless. It's a perfectly oiled machine in which all of the moving parts function with great precision. The extremely accurate true story is one that is totally entertaining to watch and especially unfolding before your eyes. You will be totally surprised that you have not heard of this real-life Cold War story until now. The Blu-ray features perfect video and audio experiences, making this even more of a perfect package. While the Blu-ray disc could have benefited from a higher quantity of special features, those that are included are of great quality, as well of great interest and will satisfy those who want to know more historical information about the era in which it is set in in 1961, and the true story upon which the film is based, and how the film adaptation was realized. If you haven't yet seen this six-time Oscar nominated highly rewarding film, then it is definitely must own for your Steven Spielberg Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

7438759,5,B015HM3E8K,"We all remember, from our history text books at least, the events from 1957 to 1962, the total hysteria of the USA about Soviet spies which had led to McCarthyism and the execution of the Rosenberg husband and wife. The fall of Cuba out of their zone or sphere of influence was a trauma they are just right now trying to put behind. The spying was primitive with those spying planes that had no chance what-so-ever to get through: the first one was the last one. On both sides they ended up with spies in their prisons kept nicely warm to be used in some political negotiations as leverage.

Consider the case of a Soviet spy in New York and that of an American pilot of a spying plane shot down over the USSR, plus the fact that East Germany turned tricky and led to the construction of the wall, and to top it all like the cherry of the cake one nave American student preparing his PhD on communist economic policy in eastern Europe was at the wrong place at the wrong moment and got arrested and prosecuted as a spy by the East Germans. But the East Germans hated the Russians who had for sure liberated them from Hitler, but who had also destroyed Berlin in the most ruthless way possible, though the Palace of the Hohenzollern was pulled down by the East Germans.

Tricky situation indeed to negotiate the release of two Americans, one of whom is a real security risk in exchange of one Soviet spy. And it took some time and a lot of patience, including against the CIA who only wanted to recuperate the security hazard out of Soviet hands before he cracked. It took a lawyer from Brooklyn, a pure Irish descendant to manage to bridge the two or three divides to get what he wanted. All those among you who have actually lived this period will remember the stress, the danger, the fear amplified by what the film does not tell: the Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961 and the Soviet missile crisis in Cuba in 1962. We went through a few years of absolute scare about the possibility of a nuclear war.

We can have a nostalgic look at the past. I was in East Berlin and East Germany for the first time in 1963. I worked in a mine near Leipzig then, in Borna. There will be more trips. The most dramatic will be in 1968 after the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia. My own son will go once in the 1980s I just wonder how Donovan managed to get lost when coming out of Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof which is practically round the corner to Unter den Linden. Well some must have some fun now and then. And it only cost him a coat and a cold.

We can also measure the immense change we have been through: reunited Germany; united Europe (nearly finished though Russia will always be on the side); free and emerging Vietnam; China the second economic power in the world; apartheid gone with the wind; Cuba accepted anew  by the USA; the banana republics of South America also gone. And yet the dangerous places have just moved to other areas and mostly because of the dumb policy of one US president who decided to solve the problem he had with his own father by proving to the world the USA could create havoc in the Middle East, and they did. And North Korea is the answer of the shepherdess to the shepherd: a perverted and fouled love song that prolongs the Korean War that was a total failure in the objective of the time to get Mao Zedong and the Communists in China down.

Is the world really a better place today than it was in 1957-1962? You have to be nave to believe that. The main difference is that spying is no longer that crucial and it has been replaced by the protection of intellectual property against pirating. Pirates and Hackers are the two plagues or our modern world. More than ever the danger is no longer from the outside but from the inside. Lets move our minds and backsides a little bit and lets clean up the mess Bush Jr. did and all European countries, especially the super-duper secular ones who pretend that everyone has the right to be a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian, or whatever, provided it is kept absolutely invisible in the public sphere, are today confronted to the bill.

Dematerialization and castration of at least two generations of immigrants in Europe from previously colonized countries, which means at least three, four or more centuries of colonial alienation, exploitation and extermination when necessary leading to uprooting them from their countries and transporting them into countries that refused to recognize and respect the fact that they are different. As the fundamentalist secularists would say: They can believe in what they want provided I do not see it. And the hazardous population is not outside but inside our borders. We have walled them up in our backyard without any rights whatsoever as for opinions and religions.

The old Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome we all in Europe inherited from centuries of wars and the two world wars was turned into a Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome called the Cold War and we are still in that mood. We see the danger outside when it is inside, and not inside our territory only but inside our minds. The new situation is that the PTSS of the Cold War is confronted today to the Post Traumatic Colonial Stress Syndrome of the uprooted millions of previously colonized people who we have brought in our countries for salaried slavery. And we think that by mocking the religion of these human beings who are suffering in their inner essence we will free them of their PTSS. Only Charlie can be that dumb. I am sure that kind of anti-empathetic attitude would have turned the 1957-1962 situation into a holocaust. And thats the real danger today. The Islamic State will be defeated but what do we do afterwards? Cartoons of the Prophet dicing onions? And I am trying hard to remain polite. I guess some secular fundamentalists do think so. Papaoutai? Really this time. [...]
Stromae help us out of this diabolical fix!

Tom Hanks is exceptional as the lawyer who is representing the Soviet spy in court, and becomes the sole American negotiator for the spy exchange. The script is terrific, the set design, costuming, and cinentaography all recreating the period in outstnading fashio, and Steven SPielberg's direction is to the point, making the plot beats hit home moment after moment.

7438955,5,B015HM3E8K,"I was pretty young when Gary Powers crashed so I did not remember many of the details.  This was a fascinating movie and extraordinary patriotism by Tom Hanks' character.

It starts a little slow but hang on as the plot unfolds and it is revealed how a lawyer from NY does what seems very unlikely at first as he works to get Gary Powers released in a swap deal.  It gets even more unlikely after he decides to negotiate the release of a second US student, in opposition to the the US government agents, in a two for one swap.

Although I don't know if it was 100% true the story shows the human side of being enemies.  There is a sub-plot of how the trust between the main character and the Russian spy develops and plays out all the way to the end as the spy adds his own little twist to ensure the US student is also released.

7439001,5,B015HM3E8K,"This is the retrospective version of a pivotal point in history of a spy exchange and the man James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who facilitated to make it possible.

I grew up in the era and remember the papers from the time. I followed it in U.S. News & World Report; at that time it was quite informative and not an echo of Time and Newsweek.

When I heard about this film I could not resist as it has great actors, producer, and director. Not to mention the consultants. You already know that Tom Hanks is good at what he does; however I was impressed with Mark Rylances portrayal of Rudolf Abel.

The movie production itself has great scenes and costumes of the time that make it fascinating from start to finish. You feel that you are there. There is a speech, not quite as long as an Ayn Rand speech that remides us what makes us Americans.

The actual story comes off a tad different then memory. Actuarially a tad better and I never received the full picture. Until I read different this will be my impression of the time.

7439008,5,B015HM3E8K,"Set during the height of the cold-war the film depicts the tensions and suspicions at .a time when many believed
there were 'reds in the bed' so to speak, and questioned any and all strange behaviour patterns, the world at large
was afraid of it's own shadow.
When a suspected Spy 'Rudolf Abel' (Mark Rylance) is apprehended it becomes necessary if but just to demonstrate
that proper procedure is followed in the eyes of the World an American lawyer is recruited 'James B Donovan' (Tom
Hanks) to defend the accused in court even though the outcome was never in doubt.
'James B Donovan' had been given a 'poison-challis' a case he could not win, a case that would attract wide-spread
publicity, a case that would if but initially make him a subject of hatred from the public at large.
He defends his client to the best of his ability and will argue that rather than issue a death-penalty on 'Rudolf Abel'
it would be a wise choice to keep him alive and perhaps use him in a future prisoner exchange deal with the Soviets.
This would prove in time to have been a wise judgement......
When pilot 'Francis G Powers' (Austin Stowell) is shot-down on a spy-mission over Soviet territory and is captured
alive the exchange deal plan becomes a real prospect.
A negotiator is required, 'James B Donovan' is approached to go into East Berlin beyond the newly constructed wall
to broker a deal.
This, would not prove an easy task as it seems his negotiations are with more than one source, hearing of a student
'Fredric Pryor' who had found himself trapped in East Berlin during the construction of the wall, 'James B Donovan'
gambles that he can negotiate the release of both the American airman and the student in exchange for convicted
Spy 'Rudolf Abel'
Will his gamble come off ?
This, surely, a Stephen Spielberg classic in waiting - The film certainly capturing the mood of those times.
A superb, and often tense movie which also manages to capture moments of humour along the way....a must see.

(My husband, the technocrat about all things aviation and military had a few issues with the ""crash"" scene, but Hollywood has to make things entertaining or we wouldn't buy tickets, right?)  We were preteens at the time of these happenings, and aware to a limited extent of the goings-on.  My husband (of course) has actually studied quite a bit about the shoot-down of the U-2 and its pilot.  We were not familiar with the actual details of the spy exchange, but found the drama fascinating.  Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast do a fine job and we highly recommend this film to those looking for a cerebral film rather than an action-pic.",1458777600,,683,4.565573770491803

7439034,2,B015HM3E8K,"While the acting and visuals are fantastic, and Tom Hanks convincing in his lead role, the biggest fault of Bridge of Spies is the pacing. The flow of this film is cold, slow and frequently boring. The reviews describe this as a ""thriller"" but I failed to be thrilled. There was a moment in the film when a spy plane was shot down (with excessive CGI) that was momentarily intense, but then it was back to more of the slow, cautious dialog, with lots of drinking, drudgery and cold imagery of cold-war Germany. Another observation: the music was tepid, and it's disappointing to see Spielberg working with someone other than John Williams after all of these years.",1458777600,,664,4.683760683760684

7439061,5,B015HM3E8K,Wow great movie! No spoiler alerts here but in general the first half was slow but when in Europe it got suspenseful. I particularly like how each character was identified in the film leaving no confusion as to who's who which is common in spy flicks. For all you action packed spy movie 007 lovers this film is a drama and most likely for true men in the shadows enthusiasts.,1458432000,,376,4.385714285714286
7439062,5,B015HM3E8K,"Spoiler Alert: plot of movie revealed in this review.
I wanted to see this movie because I saw a documentary about the 13-year old newspaper boy who was given the hollow nickel coin with the microfilm in it, who turned the coin over to the police, leading to the arrest of the Soviet spy Able. This movie extended that story with the exchange of Able for 2 Americans imprisoned by the Soviets and East Germans: the U-2 pilot Gary Powers and an American student.

I am surprised that Gary Powers was portrayed as such a 'cavalier' character. Given his highly skilled, dangerous and responsible job, and how he died by sacrificing himself to save people on the ground, I would have thought Powers to be a much more serious person. I am glad the movie showed that he was vindicated, albeit too many years after his death. I could have done without the parts about Donovan's family; or about Able's purported relatives. I would have liked to have found out how Able was really treated by the Soviets, once he was returned. But I suppose I can research that for 'real' history.

I didn't think I'd like this movie because so much of it is dark and gray, and it's mostly talk with very little action. But now, the day after seeing it, I am liking it more. I hope it is historically accurate, although movies are not obliged to stick to the objective, accurate story-telling. It is very low key but still entertaining and has some historical value.",1458432000,,1441,4.55984555984556

7439078,4,B015HM3E8K,"Entertaining, not too much liberal slant against expectations once I found out Tom Hanks was starring. The Russians and East Germans were clearly still the bad guys, as it was back then in Berlin; although the few scenes with women and children jumping out of the 3rd floor of buildings to either freedom, or their death did not cover half the human tragedies created by the soulless socialist/communist prison system of the East.",1458345600,,430,4.904109589041096

We all know that the Russian and East Germans were the bad guys and that everything we do is justified by our endless search for peace, freedom, and democracy.  We also know that the pain man inflicts on other men is boundless.  We know how rabid the masses become when infected with nationalism/jingoism and how easily a few sociopathic leaders can inflame gullible. Most of us are aware of the danger mobs offer and that hateful men/women will shoot people's houses if they disagree with peaceful people who live in that house.  We shoot abortion facilities don't we?  In sum, this movie simply reprises that which reality and history has taught us (except we did not pay attention) a thousand times...that human nature is not a pretty thing.

7439141,5,B015HM3E8K,"Fascinating study of the manner in which personal integrity can advance patriotic aims.  In my estimation, BRIDGE OF SPIES is Hanks' best performance wedded to Spielberg's best film.  As in MUNICH, Spielberg skewers spying as organized savagery--too simplistic an evaluation of the secret warfare that is crucial to national security.  Mark Rylance and Amy Donovan deserve better scripts; Russian spies and American housewives are surely more voluble in any era than the film's writers apparently can imagine.  Middle-class daily life in the early 1960's is reconstructed impressively right down to the kids' TV dinners served on the family's living-room coffee table.  Spielberg even managed to avoid a habit that has diminished some of his best work--attachment of a lengthy denouement to an otherwise spellbinding story; Spielberg gets in and out of BRIDGE OF SPIES adroitly, leaving his audience with plenty to think about.",1458086400,,927,5.454545454545454

More so as my father was Air Force we followed the news at home and anything flying/space related.  I appreciate the films part narrative on how loose some of the legal and Gov't people played with the law.  If some find it offensive understand that we see the same jingoistic attitudes in dealing with the war on terror so many decades later.  Donovan (Hanks) gets to remind us that Americans are not  American because of race, ethnic group or faith but are part the most successful experiment in representative democratic government because we believe in it. Today we still find it difficult to balance the safety of our homes with the protection of our rights.  The films tense mood and stark landscapes echo the bleakness of a still post-war Europe and ever present fear of Soviet plans for world domination.",1458000000,,943,4.616766467065868

7439272,4,B015HM3E8K,"Very well done but I never felt it was the fifties or more than a story ""based on"" actual events.  From the first scene, I'm pretty sure the subway cars still had incandescent bulbs and those hand holding straps for passengers.  Whatever.  There is some commentary on the disc that the people who worked on this movie knew about Gary Powers but not the swap, which like the joke about World War II, was in all the papers.

My recollection of the duck and cover stuff is that we never actually did any of that.  Yes, there were Civil Defense signs everywhere but we never had a rehearsal or filled our bathtubs to conserve water.  I also recall that Gary Powers was vilified upon his return, where the movie suggests a brave man whose return was met with a mild distaste.

The story about the student in East Berlin was new to me.  He's interviewed in the short that accompanies the movie and assuming the movie tells this accurately, it seems like he still doesn't realize how lucky he was.  The short also features Gary Powers' son who tells a very different story about his father which, for all I know, might be the truth.

Fact or fiction, it was well done but stretched out.  There's a scene near the end where Tom Hanks is standing alone on the bridge, his job completed.  This is obviously the end of the movie but it goes on from there.  There is a wonderful moment with kids climbing a fence but this could have gone earlier and saved some time.",1457827200,,1454,4.400749063670412

7439321,4,B015HM3E8K,"Steven Spielberg, director of Bridge of Spies, written by Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Cohen, reenacts the events leading to the exchange of Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, a Soviet spy convicted of espionage by the American government, for U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (shot down in Soviet airspace), and an American economics student, Frederic Pryor, on February 10, 1962.  Tom Hanks brings his customary gravitas, humor, and integrity to the role of James B. Donovan, formerly General Counsel for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and in the film, an insurance lawyer.  In a nice cameo, Jims boss, played by Alan Alda, urges his employee to defend Abel, since the United States has to appear to be giving Abel a fair shake in the eyes of the world.  However, Abels conviction is a foregone conclusion in the eyes of everyone but Donovan.

When Jim meets Abel in 1957, the lawyer is taken with this soft-spoken and self-contained man who will not sell out his country.  Instead of mounting a perfunctory defense, Donovan does everything that he can to exonerate Abel, and later argues his case all the way to the Supreme Court.  The second half of Bridge of Spies is a dramatic portrayal of Donovans efforts to make a deal with the East Germans (Pryor is their prisoner) and the Soviets.  If Donovan succeeds, Abel will be repatriated to Russia and Powers and Pryor will return to the United States.  There are formidable obstacles in Donovans path, not the least of which is the CIA: American intelligence officials do not care about Pryor, but Donovan wants both young men to go home.

This is an earnest and engrossing movie based on historical events.  If you want to learn about the films many inaccuracies and anachronisms, check out the Internet Movie Database for goofs, of which there are many. In addition, Spielberg cannot resist sensationalizing the Cold War paranoia that gripped both sides during the fifties and sixties.  We see stern-faced teachers prepping their terrified students for Armageddon; angry neighbors and strangers hissing at and attacking Donovan for defending Abel; and Donovans stay-at-home wife, Mary, played by Amy Ryan, imploring him to back off for the sake of his family. Both Hanks and Rylance are outstanding in their respective roles, and the final portion of the film is riveting.  Hanks flies to Europe where he feels as if he has entered the looking glass into Wonderland.  Trying to get a straight answer from anyone seems impossible, but Donovan is a savvy negotiator who delivers persuasive arguments.  The cinematography is dark, moody, and atmospheric, and Bridge of Spies transports us to a time when America had one major enemy--the USSR--and was willing to do anything to neutralize the Soviet threat.",1457827200,,2756,4.989082969432315

The acting is brilliant, Tom Hanks should have got an Oscar,  Mark Rylance deservedly won best supporting actor as Rudolf Abel. He doesn't have that much screen time, but for the film to work so well, it is essential that the audience has sympathy for Abel and Rylance does a great job of developing the character so that we feel that sympathy by the time the exchange is finally made. I loved the scene where the FBI are searching his apartment and he calmly palms the crucial code message and covers it with paint.

The locations were well done as well. Berlin looked and felt like it must have done in the early 1960's I liked the sub-plot about Charles Pryor too, where Donovan knows full well that the Russians pulled the strings in East Germany and the East Germans just did as they were told. He knew that including Pryor in the exchange was a done deal despite all the huffing and puffing of the Germans.

There is no creativity on the part of the producer(s) or actor(s) when they choose to insert bad words. Maybe it is too much of a challenge to come up with a way to appropriately express anger, frustration, disappointment and other emotions in movies. For me, it ruins the entire film. Swearing doesn't make any movie better. More often than not, it's unnecessary and the words come out sounding awkward or just plain stupid.

7439405,5,B015HM3E8K,Up front I have a bias towards movies based on true events.  Second although I was a viable human being during the event so I was very interested in the content because there were a lot of things that I had forgotten.  The attitudes and fears of the times seemed accurate.  The artful way the film captured the times illustrated the bright light that was America and the dull coldness of the Soviets.  Then tension of those irresistible forces gave me a cold sweat.  The helplessness of the situation for the Soviet and US protagonist was offset by the sweet release at the bridge.

Its hard to take the emotions of the ""real"" characters seriously when there are so many obvious phonies.  I must be the only person that feels like this about Spielberg  movies but I wouldn't have watched the movie had I known.  The audience is not smart enough to figure out who the bad guys are so we are presented with cartoon bad guys.  Example--the fake family of the Russian spy shown to Hanks to appeal to him emotionally.  These people were so obviously a plant that the audience feels satisfied that we American are so much smarter than our Russian counterparts that we are able to unmask the deception.  How about some nuance instead.  Give the Russians  and the audience some credit for having a little bit of intelligence.  I would have liked to come away from that scene thinking, "" I wonder if that family was real or a plant"" .  Or, "" should I feel sorry for this Russian spy's family or not, maybe they are a plant:""  Instead I am bludgeoned by intentionally extra clumsy acting so I don't miss that the Russian are trying to manipulate Hanks.

7439550,3,B015HM3E8K,"Spielberg is one of the greatest director's in film history. He made his name directing brilliant popular films for the general audience, often accompanied by the disdain of elitist critics.

Which makes what follows a bit ironic. Because when Spielberg begins to delve into politics, even in passing, the populism of his early career evaporates into a smug disdain for the same audience he once made films for. Not sure where it began, but his later films have been a strange combination of moral vapidness, moral equivalence, and a studied, self-aggrandizing contempt for the common man. In Saving Private Ryan you had the bizarre line about how saving Ryan would perhaps be the only decent thing they did in WW2, with the nobility of the enterprise of putting down Hitler and liberating Europe an afterthought. In Munich it was the alleged moral equivalency between terrorists and those who fight them. In Lincoln it was the myth of the great, enlightened leader dragging the ignorant, fearful masses into the light.

While Bridge of Spies shares the tendencies of the others (such as creating a false equivalency between Soviet espionage and US attempts to combat Soviet aggression; made all the stranger by the film's depictions of the building of the Berlin Wall) it is Lincoln with which it shares it biggest faults. In Lincoln Spielberg propounded the myth that Lincoln single handedly pushed through the 13th Amendment against a bigoted Northern populace. Except the 13th Amendment  passed the House with 7 votes more than the required 2/3rds majority and was subsequently ratified by the requisite number of states. Spielberg went so far as to exaggerate opposition to the amendment, which served to build the theme of a man of principle heroically standing against the ignorant mob.

In Bridge Hanks is the man of principle and we are the ignorant rabble he is standing righteously against. The film deliberately depicts the accused Soviet spy Abel as a quiet, sensitive man who may not be guilty and anyway was just being a good soldier. In fact Abel was guilty as hell and likely ran the Soviet US espionage operation, starting during Stalin's regime. But allowing this undercuts the heroic tale. And worse we are depicted as loathsome. Not only have we (the film suggests) been unfair to Abel and Hank's character in representing him, but we are allegedly driven by irrational fear of nuclear war (seriously) which the film depicts as childish despite being set only a few years before the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The apex of this tale of righteous man of principle standing up to the ignorant, bigoted masses is a completely fictional scene where someone pours gunfire into Hank's house while his family cowers in terror. Spielberg would not even go with the standard brick through the window route. Nope. Having persecuted Abel and Hanks, having been driven by unfounded fears which seem all too founded even within the film's universe, we stoop so low that we will even engage in cold blooded murder.

Other distortions and exaggeration follow, enhancing Hank's heroic status, but those are standard cinematic license. But to me the dripping contempt for the common man (you and me) in which Spielberg's frames the story ruins the experience. It has its moments and Spielberg has an admirable economy as a filmmaker. But seeing a brilliant populist director bogged down in elitist self-pandering is unfortunate.",1457308800,2,3427,5.045936395759718

I wasn't the only one complaining though - 2 of our group loved the movie and 2 of us were feeling lucky to have made it through the whole thing without falling asleep. I like dramas, I just expect some actual drama in my dramas - enough to keep me interested. What did keep me interested was the acting, the scenery, and the possibility of an interesting plot-line. But what was really annoying were the long, drawn out scenes paired with music building to loud crescendos telling me that I should be experiencing some kind of intense drama at these spots, but... not really feeling it. It actually reminded me of the movie The Monument Men which similarly should have trimmed down some scenes and not been so full of itself with the pregnant pauses and commanding music - and you just feel the movie's embarrassment as you think - oh - I don't think they quite got where they wanted to go.",1457222400,,1009,4.51912568306011

The movie was right on about the overwhelming fear about the Soviets during that time, how little children were taught about the bomb. As I was alive during this time but very young, I remember hearing about Gary Powers being shot down by those ""dirty commies,"" however I didn't recall a thing about the exchange.

7439743,5,B015HM3E8K,"This wonderful and I think underrated film by Steven Spielberg is a joy for people who like thoughtful movies, as opposed to ""shoot-em-ups.""  What's especially interesting was the beauty of the filming, a huge contrast to spy films from the 1960s which were often very dark.  Every shot is beautiful, some might say ""gorgeous,"" and a reflection of the director at his peak and terrific cinematographer.

The plot involves the Cold War, our relations with Russia and Germany at that time following WWII, and in part, an episode many Baby Boomers will remember at least vaguely concerning Francis Gary Powers and a spy plane that was shot down in Europe.  Fascinating and fun.

Won a best supporting actor award at the Oscars recently, well deserved.  Lead actor Tom Hanks was a joy in every moment onscreen, even moreso than usual, we thought.  A pleasure to see, both in the theater, and later, on BluRay purchased here on amazon.  Much to enjoy here.",1457049600,,951,4.827160493827161

The film was well edited, ,  mixing in the spy plane footage back and forth to hold our interest.  The script overall was not one of Hanks best vehicles to stretch his usual amazing skills, but he did a A plus job.  I thought movies like Castaway,Private Ryan, and Forest Gump were more engaging.  Its a good movie to rent, not for children as the topic is too heady and I don't think its one to purchase, even if your a die hard Hanks fan like me.",1456963200,,654,4.150793650793651

7439852,4,B015HM3E8K,"This movie is about a spy exchange between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War period of the late 1950s, with an additional complication involving East Germany.  It is often difficult to make a movie interesting when everyone already knows the outcome.  Despite that, I did enjoy this movie because the acting was quite good and the movie was fast-paced.  I thought Tom Hanks was excellent.  Mark Rylance (the Cromwell character in Wolf Hall) played the Russian spy, a role for which he won this year's Oscar for best supporting actor.  His role was surprisingly subdued, but effective.  His expressions and tones of voice rarely changed.  He played a man who was reticent and seemed resigned to his fate.

I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5, because I don't think it qualified to be an outstanding movie.  I thought it was very good and I would recommend it to those who might be interested in this type of movie.  I'm glad I watched it.",1456876800,,954,4.591715976331361

Maybe there's a portion of Russia that I didn't know existed or, that tidbit was fleshed out while I was heavily sedated by the movie's content.

7439870,5,B015HM3E8K,"After you watch the movie, be sure to watch the bonus feature that has interviews with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, the gov't still won't say what Abel's spying consisted of, apart from being a relay between Soviet spies and the person who took the information out of the country. This seems too simplistic for a Colonel. When will we get the rest of the story?

The movie kept my interest even though I was familiar with the events portrayed. While the movie took a few liberties with the facts for dramatic effect, it did reveal some of the behind the scenes negotiations that were not reported by the media.

The stoic portrayal of Rudolph Abel was realistic and bewitching- what does he really think about all of this? The epilog really made me appreciate how capable the Tom Hanks character was. I was unaware of his historical contributions.

If you love fast-paced, violent, and action-packed movies, you will be disappointed in Bridge of Spies. This is all about character and drama. If you have seen Richard Burton in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, then you know how this plot flows.",1456876800,,1114,4.702564102564103

I'm not sure I believe that things happened just as shown in the movie, but I suspect the overall story is true. One can certainly see the hand of Steven Spielberg in the wholesome depiction of American life at the time of the movie's setting. Tom Hanks makes any movie better, but most of all, the performance of actor Mark Rylance as the caught Russian spy was the most impressive component of this movie. He made the character absolutely intriguing, and hence the outcome of the story moving.",1456876800,,601,4.626168224299065

7439965,3,B015HM3E8K,"Quite frankly rather disappointing.  A great story, without a doubt, but I felt the movie lacked the drama and tension I was expecting in a high stakes thriller.  I don't fault Hanks much (Ever seen 'Castaway'?  The guy is BRILLIANT!) but instead think how the story was told or laid out was the reason.  Pacing was slow and disjointed at times.  The movie showed hardly anything of the difficulties endured by Francis Gary Powers (which would have then better showed the tension involved in the prisoner exchange), the Russian spy was portrayed as a total gentleman and class act (unsure if that is historically accurate or not), the flying related scenes of the American U-2 pilots receiving TOP SECRET/classified instruction about the spy plane were pathetic (class in an OPEN hangar? really?), hardly any emotion by the fellow U-2 pilot who was sent to ID Powers during the prisoner exchange, the prisoner negotiations before the exchange sounded like casual business meetings.  Not a total waste of 2 hours but whereas before watching the movie I was seriously considering buying a copy because, hey, it's Tom Hanks!

7440134,4,B015HM3E8K,"I enjoyed it, even as I know the Cold War was insidiously manufactured by certain corporate and state capitalist elites to be a vicious imposition on the public. We're relentlessly manipulated by our elites. In one scene, the hero's young son has filled the bathtub explaining to his father that, when The Bomb strikes, they'll be needing a ready supply of water. The boy and his classmates, terrorized by propaganda films of atom bomb blasts to which they're subjected in public school, learn how to ""duck and cover""  Allen Dulles is portrayed in Bridge as a benign authority. (In reality, he was an evil man, ""the shark""as his wife and mistress referred to him.)

7440145,4,B015HM3E8K,"When one hears the phrase, ""a Steven Spielberg film"", a number of near Pavlovian reactions occur.  Some good, some not so good.  Powerful; sentimental; schmaltzy; predictable.  WAIT.  The last one just doesn't cut it anymore, especially with ""Bridge of Spies"".  This Cold War elegant painting of a movie is simply a fine piece of work from a powerful craftsman.  What appears from the promotional poster to be yet another Tom Hanks-is-the-good-smiling-American-hero-boring-us-again movie, is in fact, anything but.  This may be the best work Hanks has done in quite some time, certainly since he entered his elder statesman phase.  He encompasses the role of James Donovan, a comfortable, Brooklyn based insurance lawyer in the early 60s with cardigan wearing ease, and imbues the character with a particularly old school American cinema veritas that is all the more surprising in its effectiveness, as the viewer expects the predictable Hanks/Spielberg schmaltz to turn around the next frame's corner, yet never does.  A clear signpost ahead (to paraphrase the late, great Rod Sterling) of a quality film is the harmony of its casting.  The always emotionally intelligent Amy Ryan is pinpoint as ever as Donovan's sort of long suffering wife, and Mark Rylance as the Russian spy Rudolph Abel earned his Best Supporting Actor nomination with a beautifully understated dignified gem of a performance.  The subtly intelligent script by the Coen brothers (yes, them) both reminds us of the dark edginess of the Cold War in all its nuclear showdown possibilities, while cleverly presenting a view of the ""enemy"" as suffering humans too.  With production design and cinematography both of Seth Curry like accuracy, the viewer is fully transformed into the darkly difficult Eastern Europe of the early cold war era.  Guided by pitch perfect performances every step of the way---Sebastian Koch the wonderful lead in ""The Lives of Others"", Mikhail Gorevoy, Jesse Plemmons (try not to think of his well deserved demise in ""Breaking Bad"") Dakin Matthews and the always crackling Alan Alda---the intertwined stories of Gary Powers and Abel come to life in a manner and with mannerisms that both detail this period in history and cry out for a little bit of our better angels today.
Well worth seeing, and maturely provocative, ""Bridge of Spies"" is a walk to be taken.",1456617600,3,2356,5.168421052631579

Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan the lawyer that throws this all together.. and I loved Tom Hanks portrayal of Donovan.  There were times when I was disappointed for him.. cold for him.... saddened for him and angry for him.  Which tells me that Spielberg and Hanks pulled it off  for they brought emotion from me as I watched the movie.

The most sympathetic character in the film was the Soviet spy which I found somewhat surprising. Hanks was the spy's attorney and they developed a deep mutual respect by the film's end.

7440501,5,B015HM3E8K,"Actor Tom Hanks and Director Steven Spielberg once again teams up to make a historical Cold War drama thriller about an American lawyer who was asked to negotiate the release of an American spy whose U-S plane was shot down in the Soviet Union. The result of the tandem's 6th partnership is Bridge Of Spies.

James B. Donovan is an insurance lawyer who was asked to defend an accused spy Rudolf Abel,who was caught in some illegal activities in the United States. The prosecutors were thinking that he will not take the case seriously amidst the Cold War. But apparently he did. Despite of being proved guilty,he avoided the death penalty for his client. Also,Donovan tried his best to defend Abel up to appealing his case in the Supreme Court.

Years after,Donovan was asked to negotiate for the release of Francis Gary Powers,an American spy was caught in the USSR after the U2 pilot plane was shot down. They did this through an exchange of spies with the United States releasing Abel and the Soviets releasing Powers. Aside from that,Donovan also worked for the release of Frederic Pryor,an American economics graduate student,who was visiting his German girlfriend in East Berlin.

The film was interesting. No question about it. While the film had an understated impact,the unpredictability of the characters kept the movie interesting from beginning to end. It was nice to see a something wherein friendship is developed among people who wouldn't trust each other. As for the performances,Tom Hanks could be considered superb. But Mark Rylance definitely deserves an Academy Award nomination for being great as the Soviet spy Abel. As for Spielberg,he still remains the best director when it comes using visual images in telling the story. This deserves the highest rating.",1456099200,,1780,5.0476190476190474

7440503,5,B015HM3E8K,"I was blown away by this film.  It could have focused on the basic suspense--on what will happen next.  Instead it focused on the ethical issues involved.  The suspense in these far outweighed the mere question of who will live or who will die.  It isn't preachy.  It isn't beating you with a stick.  It is telling a story that is worth hearing and worth reflecting on.  If you want to watch a thoughtful thriller, this is the one for you.  The questions grappled with in this film are not strange, abstract philosophical theories (which, in movies, are also often off the wall, like the Matrix trilogy).  This deals with questions which are everyday, especially--fear vs. the human rights of the one you fear.  Quite the question to bring up in these decades of terrorism.  The film doesn't lean one way and then the other, like some movies.  Those claim to leave the viewer with the ability to decide the answer on their own.  They don't.  All they do is leave the viewer with a question as confused and sticky as it was before they watched said movie.  This movie takes a character who is firm and who believes in something enough to risk his life for it.  It places this character in a situation in which every facet of that belief will be challenged.  It shows his response.  You, the viewer can decide whether he is right or wrong.  The movie, and history, have their answer, but the film is not preachy.  It opens up discussion.  Oh, and it is thrilling, filled with interesting--and often likable--characters, and well-made.  It's a good movie plus all that wonderfulness.  Go watch it, if you haven't already.  It is well worth the time!  Have a discussion afterwards too!

I must also add that, for a historical spy movie, it did not seem like it was much exaggerated.  I know nothing of the original events; but, let's face it, we can tell when the movie director is obviously exaggerating.  I don't think it was the case here.",1456099200,,1938,4.571428571428571

Mr. Spielberg and his company (including all actors), captivated and held my interest througout the movie, especially from the incredibly realistic beginning to the end of the movie, a rare accomplishment, but one I would gladly see again simply because it is that good.

Superb storytelling, superb acting, an excellent history lesson about this particular time in history (I was only a toddler during the time in which this movie is set).

It is also very thought-provoking from beginning to end (and after the end, when I and the people who had watched it with me launched into literally hours of discussion).

I was constantly thinking that I thought Donovan (Tom Hanks) was right about most of his decisions, wrong about a few, but I always liked him because in every decision he was highly principled and certainly brave and heroic, and most of the time I agreed with him (1000% after he agreed to negotiate the prisoner swap with the Soviets and East Germans -- he was at his most heroic then).  The kind of man I'd want as a close friend for life, and debates/discussions with him would have been epic and fascinating.  Donovan seemed so ordinary on the surface, but scratch the surface and you discovered a man of rare intelligence, human insight, moral and ethical principle, cleverness, and courage.

The movie deeply engaged my emotions and really made me think.  I cared very much indeed for Donovan and both American men he struggled to save.  I even cared about Mr. Abel, the enemy spy he had to defend at trial.  This movie isn't relevant only in a historical context.  The emotional, moral, ethical, and political questions raised in this movie are forever relevant, especially in our modern times.  I and many of my family and friends will re-watch this movie many times.",1456012800,2,1977,4.689855072463768

7440605,5,B015HM3E8K,"This movie was suspenseful, and very emotional & entertaining. Based on a true story, it was interesting to see them include building the wall between east and west Berlin. Rudolf Abel was brilliantly played as well.  Tom Hanks who played James Donovan actually believed that Abel deserved a fair trial, which ended with Abel being given 30yrs in prison instead of a death sentence. The judge was clearly bias as most Americans were at that time in history. I'm sure the hatred for Donovan was palatable and frightening for his family. In the end, Abel was used by the gov't to swap a downed pilot, but Donovan also included a deal for am American student. At that time the FBI didn't think it was a wise decision to include anyone else but the pilot. I loved the ending of the movie, which was bitter sweet for Donovan. (no spoiler alert needed) Many of us lived through the Cold War and were fortunate enough to have experienced the wall that divided East from the West taken down.

Directed masterfully, it demonstrates that serious business can be conducted professionally, even covertly, with recognition we have roles we play.  Playing our roles, keeping our word:  Trust.  Old concepts with reliability, dependability and accountability that make things work.  Not very apparent these days.  Neither is the wisdom of thinking ahead, anticipating the way things will need to work to get the best outcome for everyone.  Heavy duty stuff.

7440770,5,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a nominee for Best Picture for the 2016 Oscars. The film also received 5 other nominations, including Actor in a Supporting Role, Original Score, Production Design, Sound Mixing, and Original Screenplay and for good reason. Tom Hanks is as always, wonderful. They year is Cold War era 1957,and Hanks plays a New York insurance lawyer named James Donovan. Donovan is selected to provide defense, pro-bono for a man named Rudolf Abel, an artist but also a man that the United States has accused of spying for the Russians.
Donovan makes many enemies as he upholds the law in Abel's defense and while everyone wants him ""to hang"" (to get the death penalty), Donovan is focused on the law and due process. He also has the ability to foresee the future at a time when maybe an American may be held by Russia - keeping Abel alive to be able to trade for an American if need be. A master negotiator, Donovan takes the offer by the CIA to travel to East Berlin and conducts several negotiations with the Soviets and East Germans to exchange Abel for a recently captured U.S. Air Force pilot, Francis Gary Powers and a Yale economics student. This is a story about maintaining ones integrity, justice and the American way of life despite the herd or pack mentality or hysteria to send ""the enemy"" to the death. A brilliant film, a superb cast and wonderful performances all around.",1455667200,,1422,4.692

It did take some time before Powers was accepted by the American people. Especially since the Berliners, the Russians and  the Americans were very near mass annihilation of each other. One has to understand the period, the false sense of trust and the time when this world was still in recovery from World War II.

7440798,5,B015HM3E8K,"The anti-hero of Bridge of Spies is a washed up former Russian brigadier general living in Brooklyn (Is there ever any end to Brooklyn?) who is arrested on espionage charges. He is much more interested in his hobby of acrylic painting than in the occasional decryption of intelligence messages for the Soviets. And it is deep into his art that we find him when the film opens. Mark Rylance as the general plays a deeply stoic figure against the principled activism of his defense attorney, Tom Hanks, the all-American who believes in the rule of law and public service to right a wrong. Hanks becomes the crusader for the man who has lost his faith in the certainties of ideology. Rylance's stoic refrain at several setbacks in the plot comes as a counterpoint to Hanks emotional outrage and engagement. His reply is always: ""Would it matter?""",1455580800,,843,4.780821917808219

This movie is a very credible effort to portray not only a real conflict but one of the only real spy exchanges ever done with the rulers of the iron curtain. The Soviets NEVER wanted to trade prisoners because they felt that it made them look a mix of weak politically and that it just did not look TOUGH. And what was a Russian who did not look TOUGH worth? Pretty much nothing.

So Tom Hanks yet again is portraying an American guy who is trying to do not just the easy thing but the right thing in a world really gone astray wayyyy off the railroad tracks that most of us consider modern day life. Its easy to be a gun wielding psychopath, a cut out character who just is there to look tough and tote a gun.
What makes this a real epic story is how his character pulls the hidden levers of government even when those governments by any standard of today are rip-off-artists of the highest caliber shysters and one step above third world banana republic dictators.",1455580800,,1025,4.283505154639175

Hanks is superb as a New York  insurance lawyer, fourteen years beyond his past as a Prosecutor seeking justice at the Nuremberg Trials, is suddenly dropped into the world of Spies to provide a credible legal defense for accused Russian spy, Rudolph Abel.  After Abel is tried and convicted, he returns to his law firm in NewYork, only to be brought in to seeking to trade his client, Abel, for captive U-2 pilot, Gary Francis Powers.  Armed only with his U.S. Passport and a dry, quick wit, he crosses into East Berlin, to negotiate Powers' release with East German and Russian covert representatives . . .  An excellent movie, only marred by U-2 shoot-down imagery that doesn't have the tail-section ripped off by explosive shockwaves from three or more Soviet Surface to Air SA-2 Guideline missiles;  plus the U-2 imagery used, was not portraying the U-2B actually flown by Powers, but rather a twenty years newer TR-1 version of the U-2 design.

7440924,5,B015HM3E8K,"you know it's good.  This movie is ""inspired by actual events"" meaning it's a movie, okay, not a documentary.  It starts out in 1960 and is made the way movies were then, meaning no big car chase scenes or highly improbable shootouts with the bad guys.  It has a real script with excellent acting from Hanks down to the extras in the background.  Hanks plays an insurance attorney that is a partner in a large law firm in Brooklyn.  He is assigned the case of a man accused of being a Russian spy.  The government wants the spy to get a fair trial before they hang him and everybody but Hanks, a big believer in the Constitution, is all for it.  If you were old enough to know what was going on between the USA and the USSR in those days, and I was, then you already know how the story ends but there's a lot of suspense before you get there.  There's no sex, the F word is used a few times, and no blood and guts violence so the kids will lose interest fairly quickly with this movie.",1455580800,,985,4.147368421052631

7440997,1,B015HM3E8K,"I give the film 1 star because I can't give it fewer.  I love Cold War books and films.  This one is politicized garbage and historical revisionism using a modern critique provided by Obama and the DNC (I don't mean this literally, but by all appearances, it seems so).  This is Spielberg's second bomb within the last few years.  He seems hooked to the notion that we must view history through the lens of the Democratic party in the United States.  The writers overuse of tired lines and modern political cliches (i.e., Tom Hanks' exhortation that executing a Soviet spy ""is not who we are"" seems awfully close to the line Obama utters over and over with regard to anything that doesn't fit his political philosophy, to the extent he has one).

The treatment of the CIA in the film is absurd.  The treatment of the average ""Joe"" American citizen is also ridiculous.  The citizen is the mob.  The CIA incites the mob and doesn't give a damn about, well, anything except achieving whatever mission comes it's way.  In this film, only a few are enlightened enough to believe that an American student's life is worth saving from the clutches of the Stasi.  The CIA is shown to not care even a little bit about getting that kid out.  So Tom Hanks saved him and made fools of the CIA.  What a joke.  The men of the CIA at the time were not all good, but they were highly educated and many of them were very good, moral men.  Many, if not most, had served in the U.S. military.  If there was a chance they could get this kid out of a Soviet prison, they would have taken it.  In this film, the CIA operatives are portrayed as malicious dimwits.

Tom Hanks is smarmy in this film.  He just wants to ""go home and go to bed.""  I heard that repeatedly in this film.  There was also the line from the Soviet spy given in response to Hanks' question, ""are you not worried?""  The spy responds, ""would it help?""  Sort of cute when he said it...the FIRST TIME.  When they made the joke again a SECOND TIME, I gave it a pass.  Then near the end of the film, they dropped this clever little bomb a THIRD TIME.  Same question, same response - THREE TIMES.  So funny.  So clever.  Modern films are so often garbage and this one is no exception.  Please don't waste your time or money.",1455580800,23,2266,4.351674641148326

It is a thankless job, one no one else will take, and in spite of unrelenting opposition  from the Court, he engineers a life sentence instead of the death penalty.  This is a thrilling film, although it has a somber tone.  The scenes that occur behind the Berlin Wall are at once highly charged and thoroughly compelling.  Hanks is believable as a man capable of courageous acts will maintaining a quiet demeanor.  Anyone who remembers the urgency of these actual events will appreciate the  cliffhanger nature of sending a private citizen into East Germany to arrange for the exchange of prisoners, and Hanks' willingness to sacrifice all for the inclusion of an innocent second prisoner of the Germans is outstanding storytelling.  All in all, Tom Hanks has performed in a very demanding role that has no place for his usual good humor.

It's always good to see one person take on the world and actually get his way. A man stood his ground and saved 2-3 men's life. This gave him the courage he would need to go on to negotiate 9k other lives and take on segregation in the US education system.

Without giving away too much of the plot, it is about the negotiation to secure the return of Francis Gary Powers, the American pilot who was shot down while flying/spying over Soviet Russia.  I initially was not interested in the film because the trailer is drab and uninspiring.  Well, this is the rare case where the movie is actually much more compelling and gripping than the trailer.  It is the story of an unknown (at least to me) American hero.  Tom Hanks is excellent as James Donovan, the lawyer charged with making the negotiations with Soviet Russia.  But praise is also due Mark Rylance for his understated, convincing portrayal of Rudolf Abel.  This movie reminds us of why we need to be proud of our country and our constitution.

7441290,5,B015HM3E8K,"The film masterfully exhibit's the atmosphere that was the 1950's and 1960's of tension,mistrust and misunderstanding during the Cold War. Tom Hanks portrays James B. Donovan in a brilliantly down-to-Earth manner of a  honest, unpretentious, tough-minded but compassionate lawyer that must navigate thru the clock and Dagger business of working with paranoid government agencies, but not working for anyone, or no-official cover.
The pleasingly unpredictable latter-career Spielberg has chosen to follow his magnificent rumination on the greatness of Lincoln with another category-resistant historical reenactment. Genre-wise, Bridge Of Spies (a reference to the Glienicke Bridge, where spy-swaps are made in shivering pre-dawn Berlin) dances between courtroom drama and espionage thriller. There is plenty of speechifying too, stirring gusts of high-minded virtue: American justice will be on trial! Its a meaty gumbo of Capra, Le Carr and Perry Mason. From Minority Report to Lincoln, another of Spielbergs enquiries into the nature of American goodness as ordained by the Constitution.",1455494400,3,1088,5.929936305732484

7441293,5,B015HM3E8K,"As usual Tom Hanks does a phenomenal acting job in this movie. I don't think there's been a movie yet that he's stared in that I didn't absolutely love (except maybe Cast Away with the volleyball-weird movie). Not to mention it's directed by Spielberg so you know it's going to be good.

Anyway, this movie is based on the true story of James Donovon, played by Hanks, a insurance lawyer who got the short straw sort of to speak, in having to defend Rudolf Adel a KGB spy living in America during the Cold War. (If you like these sort of KGB spy, Cold War movies you will definitely enjoy the series The Americans-so check that out). Many KGB spies infiltrated into America during the Cold War to relay vital information back to Russia.

Adel was outted by his own assistant and turned into the CIA and captured. Donovon was determined by moral standards to give him a fair trial despite the allegations of him being a KBG spy meanwhile forming a friendship in the end. During the same time US CIA spy Francis Powers spy plane was shot down over Russia and he was captured and sentenced to 10 years in prison (not being given a fair trial) Donovon then negotiates a trade between Adel for Powers to bring the young pilot home safely. This trade was done at Berlin's Glienicke Bridge where many Soviet spies were exchanged thus getting the nickname 'Bridge of Spies'

It's a good watch not only for entertainment purposes but for the true historical events as well. I definitely recommend it!",1455494400,,1491,4.5767790262172285

7441298,5,B015HM3E8K,"The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s  that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyones thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.

Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti-Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovans theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War.

The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.

7441305,5,B015HM3E8K,"An excellent, well-acted and splendidly photographed drama. At first I began to worry that Rudolf Abel (the Russian spy) was being portrayed as a little bit too likable, thus falling into the dramatic trap of so many former Hollywood films of making the communist excessively sympathetic. This was reinforced, at first, by the crass behavior of the CIA typesalways a ready target on the silver screen.

But balance was restored when the Soviets and the East Germans were shown in equally bad light. In both cases, that cinematic illumination was probably quite realistic.

Equally realistic, and really well done, was the ambience of East Berlin. I was there on both sides in 1961just at the time this incident took placeand could marvel at how completely West Berlin had been rebuilt while WW-II destroyed buildings still pock-marked the Eastern side of the city. (In August the American Embassy warned Americans to get out of the city at once as the Russians were up to something big.) The behavior of the East German border guards was perfectly portrayedtheir special selection as photogenic, politically safe and arrogant was just as I remember it.

One neat little sight-gag was the East German machers reflexive attempt to shake hands with the American student he was setting free. Germans then ALWAYS shook hands upon meeting and leaving each other! For Spielberg to have included that little touch shows how thoroughly researched this movie was.

Perhaps the most enjoyable moment of the film for me was the look on Hanks wifes face when she suddenly learned that her husband had not been on a Scottish fishing trip but was the key element in a major diplomatic endeavor. After all the public hatred directed at the family for Hanks legal defense of Abel, which he dubiously claimed was really a defense of the best of American values, to have her realize that yes, he was right, well that little epiphany just made my day.",1455408000,,1931,4.914110429447852

Spielberg is an iconic filmmaker and his limitless talent just keeps getting better through the years, aging like the finest wine.
Add the wonderful actor Tom Hanks to star as Bridge of Spies' lawyer/negotiator, and you have another winning combination worthy of a slew of Oscars.
Tom Hanks is at his best in Bridge of Spies and reaches new heights as well in his subtle protrayal of a stubborn, patriotic lawyer with a conscience in this 1957 drama based on true events.

7441350,3,B015HM3E8K,"You can't beat a Steve Spielberg/Tom Hanks alliance but unfortunately BRIDGE OF SPIES misses the mark and so much potential. It is not bad by any means but maybe expectations are too high from this creative duo. No one can deny that BRIDGE OF SPIES tells a fascinating story of US/Soviet tensions during the height of the Cold War. The US has arrested a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and the Soviets have shot down a U2 spy plane and captured its pilot Francis Gary Powers. It seems like we are headed for some heavy tension and action but actually they are limited.

BRIDGE OF SPIES starts off painfully slow. It does get better so be patient. The late 50's/early 60's dress, cars and style are definitely a plus in the film. It harkens back to a frightening era of bomb shelters and the threat of nuclear war and we thought things were scary today! It was a different time and  yet somewhat relevant to today's world.
The nature of this film does make it dialogue heavy and light on action. That changes when we see the U2 pilots training and Powers' plane crashing. Also there is a fascinating piece of history as the Berlin wall goes up. A population is trapped within the walls but what is going on as the wall is being built and it might be possible to go to the other side? Now here is a fascinating but of Cold War history unlike anything else.

Hanks stars as James Donovan. He's lawyer and for some reason is chosen to be the defender of recently arrested Abel. Donovan later seems like an unlikely candidate to negotiate the exchange of spies between the US and the Soviet Union. Donovan is requested to negotiate only for Powers' release but then adds in an American student arrested in East Berlin. It's here where the story gets interesting. BRIDGE OF SPIES briefly touches over two interesting questions. The spies are being loyal to their own countries. Aren't they heroes in a sense in their own countries? Yet,  by default, that makes them enemies and traitors to the opposing nations. Also, how do a government and its citizens treat  captured spies who have been released and returned home? Are they welcomed as heroes? Did he give away state secrets? Do they have any further use to the government? In BRIDGE OF SPIES, the U2 pilots are given a fast acting poison to use in case of capture. Powers survived the crash, so did that make him a failure for living? It would have been interesting to follow the lives of both spies after the war.

Maybe it is the Donovan character, but Hanks is rather limp and emotionless through the film. It's only mildly understood why Donovan would defend Abel. The evidence is strong proving Abel is a spy and yet Donovan goes beyond trying to make sure Abel gets a fair trial and the verdict reversed. Moral questions are raised that never get addressed fully.

Mark Rylance as the Soviet Spy Rudolf Abel is the gem in this film. We've seen Rylance before but he is one of those great actors who gets lost in often small films. Finally, he has a chance to reach a broader audience as the quiet and emotionless Abel. He is fascinating to watch and hear. He creates an accent for Abel that sometimes sounds native English speaking but then is clearly not. Good job on creating a multi-dimensional character.

BRIDGE OF SPIES is somewhat disappointing but not a bad movie. It's an important part of Cold War history that is not well known. Watch the extras to learn about the real James Donovan who had a role in the Nuremberg War Trials in Germany after WW II. Donovan was later sent by the US to negotiate the release of 1113 prisoners after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba.  At the end of negotiations, he won the release of nearly 10,000 people. Incredible man. Time for another movie about his exploits.",1455062400,,3783,4.551470588235294

7441353,5,B015HM3E8K,"This was a film I put off viewing. It did not receive the acclaim most Spielberg/Hanks film receive. What a shame on my part. This was one of the most engrossing films I have seen in the past year. I have always been a fan of the Cold War spy era, and this film more than met my expectations.

It is 1957, Tom Hanks plays Jim Donovan, an insurance lawyer called by his government to defend a man named Rudolph Abel, played superbly by Mark Rylance. He was captured for the crime of espionage against the United States on behalf of the USSR.  The man is honorable, and it seems does not give away any secrets. Donovan is asked to be Abels defense attorney by his boss, played by Alan Alda. What the government wants is a semblance of a judicial process that defends anyone. Donovan, however, is not just anyone, and he goes to the wall to defend his client. The only issue the Judge in this case listens to is that Abel would be a good body to exchange if that need ever came.

As this film proceeds, we see that Donovan does not dance to anyone else's tune, he is honorable as is his client, and when the time comes when an exchange may be needed, he is the man. This is an uplifting film needed at this time in our country's history. Tom Hanks is as always a superb actor and brings life to James Donovan. However, it is Mark Rylance who plays Rudolph Abel that brings this film to the fore. An honorable spy seems like an oxymoron, particularly in light of the manner in which an exchange is processed. Such a film should be seen by all.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-10-16",1455062400,3,1577,4.299663299663299
7441354,5,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies (2015) is reminiscent of the 1960's and 1970's European classic spy films such as: The Spy Who Cam in from the Cold (1965), Funeral in Berlin (1966), The Quiller Memorandum (1966), Torn Curtain (1966), The Odessa File (1974), and many more.  Special praise goes for cinematography, good filming locations, and acting. Tom Hanks should be getting an Oscar nomination for the portrayal of James B. Donovan.  The film is about a lawyer who in the late 1950's gets assigned by CIA to negotiate prisoner exchange between three parties: Americans, Soviets, and East Germans.  For that reason he is sent to West Berlin (the second part of the movie)  during the times when the Berlin Wall is in the process of being raised...the lawyer (Hanks) once in West Germany finds himself embroiled in a tense negotiations, full of mind games, where one is forced to rely on his wits and intuition...",1455062400,,899,4.856209150326797

The motion picture industry is bereft of extraordinary male talent. Funnily enough, there are more great leading ladies than men but far fewer quality parts.

I knew Francis Gary Powers, second-hand through his niece who I dated after his release from East Berlin. According to reports I received from his niece second hand. Powers was looked upon by the American people in total as a hero and everyone was elated that he was freed after being shot down May 1, 1960. I knew no person that held animosity towards the man for failing to kill himself prior to his capture after being shot down by Russian missiles.  The only exception that I can surmise is from the CIA which is not a barometer of the American people's thoughts and emotions in any way.

This carefully detailed film takes the viewer on a vicarious journey back in time to a world few recall accurately.  ""Duck and cover"" was a social norm, not comic relief.  Everyone believed that the Soviet Union could launch a nuclear holocaust at any time.  Tom Hanks once again shows himself an excellent character actor and presents an accurate portrayal of the American family man with a duty to do what is right even when stigmatized by his neighbors.  Slight disappoint with the lack of development of the U-2 program history.  In the film, Francis G. Powers' aircraft is shot down at 70,000 feet.  Why? There ought to have been some introduction to the fact that U-2's had been flying without incident over Soviet airspace for three years prior to the shoot sown.  It was not until 1960 that the Soviets developed missiles that could reach that altitude. Only then were U-2 planes threatened.

This film brilliantly captures the Cold War atmosphere that existed in Berlin, Germany in the early 1960s when the Berlin Wall was first constructed.  Tom Hanks, as always, is appealing and gives off an aura of integrity, which greatly adds to a film that has a taut storyline and engaging characters.  This is a fine film that viewers will enjoy more than once.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1454803200,3,677,4.843478260869565
7441493,5,B015HM3E8K,"This is an excellently done spy drama based on the true events of the cold world era.  Tom Hanks is great in the role as the lawyer who believes in his convictions.  The story is very well done and has a fantastic cat and mouse, spy versus spy plot involving the three players (Russia, East Germany and the USA) of that era.  To me, this is one of Spielbergs best films as he really does a great job at creating the old world tension during that era with scenes that realistically recreate the look of East Berlin at that time.  This is not an action packed film but instead relies on the subtle realities of the time to create a well told story with the first half of the film concentrated on the Soviet spy Abels capture (which is excellently played by Rylance) and the second half dealing with the negotiation and trade of the Russian spy with the downed American U2 pilot.  There are no big surprises in terms of the plot as this is based on real events and the story sticks to the basic events that happened but even with that this movie does a good job at creating dramatic tension throughout its 140-minute length.

This is an entertaining spy thriller that is based on real events that is entertaining and worth watching.

Bridge of Spies takes place during the Cold War in 1957 and is based on true events.  A Soviet spy has been captured and needs to be tried for his crimes.  The people are afraid of nuclear warfare and want swift and deadly justice to keep our country safe.  But who wants to defend this war criminal?  An insurance lawyer, Jim Donovan, gets the patriotic privilege of being Rudolf Abels legal counsel.

Despite his familys concerns for their reputation and safety, Jim accepts the job and represents Mr. Abel honorably.  In fact, the cards are stacked against Rudolf and some legal shortcuts were taken to get him into court.  Even when the legal discrepancies are brought forward, they are disregarded by the judge.  Jim Donovan doesnt give up and stands his ground and pleads for the court system to spare Rudolfs life as a good gesture towards Russia.

While the arraignment proceedings are taking place, a top secret U.S. pilot is shot down in Russia and a U.S. student is captured while being on the wrong side of the newly erected Berlin wall.  Jim Donovan goes above and beyond the call of duty of simply representing Rudolf Abel, and is instrumental in negotiating his safe return to his family.

Without spoiling any more details from the movie, I will say that its well worth watching for yourself. When I saw that Bridge of Spies was directed by Steven Spielberg and starred Tom Hanks, I had my expectations set pretty high.  Im happy to report that I was not disappointed and highly recommend it.  Bridge of Spies is rated PG-13 due to strong language (a few SOBs and F-bombs) and violence.  There are some emotional scenes with people losing their lives trying to reunite with loved ones on the other side of the Berlin wall.  Anyone who likes movies about war or justice should definitely check out Bridge of Spies.",1454803200,6,1900,4.712121212121212

7441516,5,B015HM3E8K,"More than any director in screen history Steven Spielberg breathes life into our past and makes it relevant to a contemporary audience.  In films as diverse as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Amistad"" and a few other stellar works Spielberg posits the proposition that history repeats itself and should never be forgotten.  Spielberg tackles the Cold War and he does not shy away from the complexity or enigmas inherent in the ideological war between the democratic and communist doctrines.  The Red Scare is illustrated with young schoolchildren being taught how to survive a thermonuclear war contrasted by Germans in East Berlin being walled in by their governors fearing they'll flee to freedom on the Western side.  The film is not a precise history because events are taken out of context to advance the narrative and Tom Hanks' character is an amalgam of many persons but the essence of the times is spot on.  What I found refreshing in this film is that despite the paranoia present at the time Spielberg doesn't subscribe to the notion that the West was wrong in fighting vociferously Communism  rather the Soviet Union was a despotic institution intent on expanding their grip on as many sovereign peoples as possible.  I found the end a tad sentimental but after offering strong medicine Spielberg is entitled to  his  personal flourishes.",1454803200,7,1342,5.036199095022624

7441520,2,B015HM3E8K,"Tom Hanks is our generation's best actor.  Stephen Spielberg is a legendary director.  That having been said, this is not a great movie.  It is too long, too slow, and too boring.  It took a moment in history of great tension and turned it into a legal procedural.  No drama, no tension.  The performances are great, but it is just dull.
It has the same problems as another Spielberg movie, ""Amistad.""  It loses all emotion in long speeches about the legal process.",1454803200,5,465,4.597560975609756
7441521,2,B015HM3E8K,"The Good:
As expected, Tom Hanks is both witty and charming throughout the movie. Both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance (who plays the accused Russian spy ""Abel"") have great on-screen chemistry. Overall, there was really good quality acting across the board. Probably one of the most lively moments occur halfway into the movie once the US military finally gets involved.

The Bad:
I think it's fair to say that the entire first half of the movie was pretty boring. You have to wait almost 45 minutes to an hour before a certain scene happens in the movie that may wake you up. Despite Hanks being portrayed as a skillful lawyer, we never really get to see any type of exciting, genius-like lawyer tactics used in the court room. The focus on the negotiations in the story are only somewhat interesting, and the suspense that it attempts to build at the end is mediocre.

Rather than shooting the movie in a dynamic way that shows the two separate stories in a parallel fashion, the movie is shot along a straight forward timeline. By showing the movie in the sequential order, it just made the movie feel longer. (2.5 hours run-time) Finally, the sense of fear and paranoia only felt mild at best. You know there's a war going on, but the real sense of urgency just isn't conveyed very well.

The Reason:

I know this is a Spielberg movie, however, unlike others, I will not simply give him a pass. The intent  and effort in this movie is definitely good. However, I just don't think that this movie lives up to the hype that Spielberg used to command. If I'm not mistaken, it's been over 13 years since Spielberg's done a major film that's appealed to average movie goers. (Minority Report 2002) This is probably the type of film that movie purists and people in the movie industry may like. I just don't see the average person really caring about this movie in the same way. I wouldn't recommend watching this in theaters. I think that if you're interested you can watch it at home and be just fine.

The Rating: 6.5/10

7441551,4,B015HM3E8K,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It seems that the lessons of history are lost on the young these days. More attention is paid to causes in history as opposed to the events that happened. When you talk about the cold war they're taught that it ended under Reagan but little about what it was or things that happened, with the exception perhaps the Bay of Pigs situation. Ask any kid who Gary Francis Powers was and chances are they won't know. Ask about the U-2 spy plane and they're likely to think its a cover band. So its nice to see the story as well as what happened around it told in BRIDGE OF SPIES.

Rather than focus directly on Powers the movie instead tells the tale from the perspective of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), the lawyer who was fundamental in securing Powers release. An insurance attorney, Donovan is recruited to defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a man accused of being a Russian spy at the height of the cold war. While we know that he is guilty, Donovan takes the task assigned seriously without questioning if he is or not.

But what Donovan truly faces is a kangaroo court. No one wants this to play out honestly, especially those in charge of the proceedings. Guilt has been determined before the trial even begins and Donovan slowly comes to that understanding as requests are denied and comments are made in chambers by the judge leaving no doubt what will follow. Not only that, Donovan and his family come under attack for his taking the case, the public unaware that he was requested to do so as opposed to taking the case willingly.

With a guilty verdict in all that is left is sentencing. The crowd calls for the death penalty. Donovan reasons with the judge suggesting that we too are spying on the Russians and should one of our spies fall into their hands it might be worthwhile to have one of theirs on hand that we could offer in trade for the safe return of ours. While the case is lost, Donovan does have this at least as solace.

When he returns to work things are different. His attempt to actually be the lawyer he thought he was supposed to have altered the attitude of co-workers. But all that is left behind when the call for his services is sent out once more.

A co-existing story has unfolded as the trial was taking place, that of Gary Francis Powers and the crash of his U-2 spy plane. Pilots have been ordered to blow up their planes and if need be kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner. Circumstance have left Powers unable to do either and he is being interrogated by the Russians concerning his plane and the plans of the U.S.

These two storylines converge when Donovan is asked to help, while not actually being a representative of the government, in setting up a trade with the Russians, Abel for Powers. Shortly before this has gone on, an American student was also arrested in the now Communist controlled East Germany days after the Berlin Wall has been erected. Donovan agrees to help and although his handlers continue to tell him to forget the student he tries to set up the trade for both Americans.

The movie unravels at a slow pace but then so do the days and weeks of a trial and the maneuvering to get a deal done in the second half of the film. Slow here is not a bad thing but instead allows the story to be told. Anyone expecting guns blazing and explosions galore will be disappointed. This is the real world and how governments actually behave most of the time. It is a fascinating tale that is handled well by director Steven Spielberg. Hanks does his usual amazing job of portraying a character who is challenged by his own morals as he walks his way through a world that seems to have none.

Perhaps its a good thing that young people will have no clue who Powers was. In watching this film they may be drawn to his story as well as an in depth look at what the cold war actually was. While there is little doubt that artistic license was probably used in the portrayal of this tale the fundamentals are there and something can be learned from the film while being entertained as well. While it is extremely well made it is the story that counts and this one offers that in spades. The fact that its been nominated for best picture at this years Oscars is proof of that.",1454630400,,4285,4.434561626429479

7441565,2,B015HM3E8K,"This was not an impressive movie at all. I really do not think Spielberg is that great of a director. I really don't. This was an badly written mess. It's the kind of movie that people would have loved in the 90's. A smarmy lawyer takes a case involving a spy for the Russians and fractures his relationships with colleagues over defending him like he's an innocent man. Whenever a judge or another colleague tells him not to take the case seriously, Hank's character's demeanor changes and becomes incredibly pompous, deriding the other person as an ignorant, backwards buffoon in what can only be described as extremely preachy.

Spielberg telegraphs scenes from a mile away. In one, a character is lying down on a couch, watching TV and the camera is focused on windows in the shot. It was beyond predictable that someone would immediately throw something threw the window or shoot it, and that's exactly what happened. Everything about it was so predictable and cliche, that it made it hard for me to take the rest of the movie seriously.

There was a lot about the movie that bothered me. It just wasn't good. It's not Best Picture material. It's not even TV movie material. It's incredibly shallow. Not a lot of thought was put into the production. I could see people guessing that this film was made in the 90's. There were so many other movies that could have been nominated for Best Picture instead of this one. It's as simple as that.",1454544000,9,1444,4.658823529411765

7441575,5,B015HM3E8K,"""Bridge Of Spies"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U-2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.

The cast led by Tom Hanks (superb as usual as James Donovan) & Mark Rylance (subtle and low-key in a Oscar-nominated performance as Rudolf Abel) is brilliant. The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also produced, Oscar-nominated) is brilliant! The (Oscar-nominated) story & screenplay by Matt Charman, Ethan & Joel Coen (both Ethan & Joel wrote their fourth story or screenplay without the benefit of directing the movie themselves, the other three are ""Gambit"", ""Crimewave"" & most recently, ""Unbroken"") is brilliant.

The (Oscar-nominated) music by Thomas Newman (taking over for Spielberg's usual composer, John Williams) is brilliant. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is brilliant. The film editing by Michael Kahn is brilliant. The casting by Ellen Lewis is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) production design by Adam Stockhausen is brilliant. The art direction by Marco Bittner Rosser, Scott Dougan, Kim Jennings & Anja Muller is brilliant. The (Oscar-nominated) set decoration by Rena DeAngelo & Bernhard Henrich, set dressings by Billy Baker, Tara Guckeen, Michael Bruno, David L. Bush, Glenn Strauss, Mike Patterson, Vincent Fellegara, Corinne Iasilli, John Michael Kehoe, Jessica LeNoble, Maria Szynkarczuk, Juan Carlos Mendoza, Travis Wright, Florian Speidel, Helko Klunder, Jochen Schuetz, Maria Schope & Tim Zydel, set designs by Michael Fissneider & Josef Brandl is brilliant. The costume design by Kasia Walicka Maimone is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mark Fichera & Leo Plank is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by John McLeod, Mark Bero and Klaus Mielich & supervised by Steven Kirshoff and Gerd Nefzer is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Daniel Walker, Kimberly Aller, Chan Ee Jien, Sze Jia Eng, Ankit Gokani, Vanessa Seow & Alene Tan and supervised by Dinesh K. Bishnoi, Sven Martin, Charlie Noble & Sean Stranks is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-done and well-crafted film that is entertaining and intriguing. Tom Hanks is superb as usual (in his fourth collaboration with Steven Spielberg) as James Donovan and Mark Rylance is subtle and low-key in a well-crafted Oscar-nominated Best Supporting Actor performance as Rudolf Abel. Their supporting cast is just as superb, with Amy Ryan (as Mary Donovan) & Alan Alda (as Thomas Watters Jr.). Steven Spielberg has directed another brilliant film to his resume. This is (or was) one of the best films of the recently done fall season and also one of the best films of last year, as well, too. This is also a solid awards contender, all around, as well, too.

First off, the acting is VERY good. The guy who plays the Russian spy is so dead pan all the time, he just cracked me up. (""Would it help?"") And of course, Tom Hanks puts on his usual great performance.

Secondly, the sets and costumes really leave you feeling immersed in the time and place. Almost has you feeling like you're an eye-witness to events not a movie watcher. Well done! I LOVE a movie that can do that!

Thirdly, the plot is really great! A real spell-binder and seemed to - for all the research I can find - follow the true events pretty faithfully. Which really makes me tip my hat to the guy Hanks plays for having such guts to press the limit. To avoid it being a spoiler, that's all I'll say about that.

This is just a very well-done movie. My only criticism would be the hokeyness of the U2 pilot being tied to his disintegrating aircraft by his O2 hose. PLEASE!",1454371200,,906,4.280701754385965

As one might expect from these old masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm, motivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent history. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular sentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations, too, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot is very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start to finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more heavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A foundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50% desperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of captive American souls as the ante.",1454284800,,837,5.396946564885496

7441601,5,B015HM3E8K,"Bridge of Spies  A different kind of lawyer movie, by Ira M. Pesserilo
Virtually all lawyer movies try to dramatize the courtroom by depicting dashing attorneys, like Gregory Peck (as the urbane Atticus Finch) or Joe Pesci (as the urban Vincent LaGuardia Gambini, My Cousin Vinny.) Yet, finally realism prevailed in a Big-Screen account of a famous trial. In Bridge of Spies Tom Hanks played James B. Donovan, a rather boring looking Middle Aged lawyer, specializing in insurance coverage issues with thinning hair, and a bloated belly, which he kept covered up with an expensive overcoat. He was an insurance coverage attorney circa 1957, who took a train from his upper middle class suburban home to his Wall Street Office, spending his days construing insurance policies.
One day at the office, his life would forever change. Before Gideon v. Wainright lawyers were drafted by the courts to defend individuals charged with serious crimes. James B. Donovan, over his protests, was drafted to defend Rudolph Abel, accused Communist spy, during the height of the Cold War. Once he began his representation, Donovan insisted that his client receive the full protections of the US Constitution, just like his adversaries in insurance coverage cases demanded the full protection of the insurance policies in effect. Donovan challenged the evidence, as having been seized in violation of the 4th Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures all the way to the US Supreme Court, where he lost a 5  4 decision. For his efforts in defending his client, Donovan found himself wildly unpopular with the judge, and the prosecution who viewed his role as being a mere decal on the system, to give the appearance of fairness, regardless of the substance.
Donovan found himself universally reviled for his defense of Rudolph Abel. But this would later change dramatically. When Francis Gary Powers was shot down in the U  2 spy plane incident, James B. Donovan was called on to negotiate the exchange of Powers for Abel, which takes up the lions share of the movie.
Yet, the question remains; how can we remain true to the Constitution, when the people we are prosecuting aren't mere criminals, but agents of a foreign government who seek the destruction of our nation? This becomes especially problematic when there is no declaration of war in effect, and military tribunals cant be utilized, as in the current War on Terrorism. And on the other hand, how far can we allow our courts to deviate from our Constitution before the rights of all are compromised, and we have lost what we were protecting?
This question, asked in US v. Abel makes Bridge of Spies truly a lawyer movie for our time.",1453593600,,2698,4.9911111111111115
7441602,5,B015HM3E8K,"The home video BD/DVD release of the latest Spielberg film (and an Oscar nominee), will not be released until February 2nd, but  as a journalist  I was provided with an advance screener in exchange for an objective review.  I won't go into the plot very much here (no spoilers from me  and I recommend that you watch for spoilers in other reviews; after all this a suspense film) but will offer a few personal comments and then move on to the bonus material  which is some of the best Ive seen lately.

I was in high school when the Berlin Wall was built and U2 pilot Gary Francis Powers was shot down in Russia. I knew much of the story, but there were parts new to me in this film (based on the true events). I do remember the duck and cover films in school and the building of fallout shelters. If you are a baby boomer you probably remember them too.

I thought Tom Hanks acting was superb but he has such an identifiable look and voice that you cant help but seeing Tom Hanks, the actor rather than the character he plays. That, to me, is the ONLY weakness in this or any film he stars in.

There are four bonus features and they are substantial and really add a lot to the film AFTER you have seen it. The longest one  at 17 minutes  is the making of featurette with all the main cast and production crew. In addition there are comments from Gary Powers son  who founded a Cold War Museum. Next comes an eight-minute short on both the U-2 pane (they are still in operation) and the air force base where some events took of  and where parts of film were filmed. The five-minute film Spy Swap focuses on both the bridge where the final act takes place and how it was filmed and lighted. Finally is an 11-minute short on how Spielberg and his director of photography (who lived on the east side of the Berlin Wall) recreated the buildings of the period  including building a long wall for filming.

The film is 141 minutes but goes quickly. This is a period in Americas history that the younger generation will not know of unless they see this film. Like Schindlers List, Spielberg has made a historical film which can be used to teach and lead to discussion.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7441603,3,B015HM3E8K,"1. This movie is based on the true story of lawyer Jim Donovan, who negotiated the release of US spy Francis Gary Powers in 1957.

2. It's co-written by the Coen Brothers, directed by Steven Spielberg, and stars Tom Hanks. So I expected an awesome movie. I did not get an awesome movie.

3. This happened during the Cold War, which means there is no violence or death in the movie. It's all talking. There was a great subplot about recruiting some Army soldiers into being spies, but it was dropped almost as soon as it was introduced. It was only used to set up the one action scene in the whole movie.

4. The actual spy scenes are really interesting. Too bad there were only two of them.

5. Even though it wasn't completely historically accurate, it was cool to see how the Berlin wall was being built, and how the city was reacting to it.

6. This is not a thriller. There's no real suspense in the movie. It's a drama with mostly talking, in courtrooms and back rooms. If you watch the first 30 minutes, you know what will happen during the next two hours.

7. The bridge referred to in the title is only in the movie for about 10 minutes.

8. The ending of the movie contradicts itself. It makes you think that one thing happened, but in the text at the end of the movie, it says the opposite thing happened.

9. The movie is decently written, decently acted, and well-shot. The movie is decently put together. But given the talent behind the film, I was pretty disappointed. I expected more than ""decent"".",1453507200,7,1513,4.397849462365591
7441604,4,B015HM3E8K,"One will be hard-pressed to find a more ardent defender of Steven Spielberg than yours truly. Jaws blew my mind the first time I watched it at the tender age of five. Its score, performances and stubborn refusal to showcase the shark until the end were so groundbreaking, even then my tiny brain acknowledged I was experiencing something special, something that transcended the boundaries of films I had seen before. E.T. infused my childhood with an existential wonder, which consequently led to my obsession with film.

I could go on about how I will totally overlook the sentimentality and unnecessarily drawn-out triple-ending of the otherwise incredible, deeply unsettling Artificial Intelligence, or the astonishing power and sincerity of Schindlers List (that one shot of a little red coat in the otherwise black-and-white film single-handedly  both visually and emotionally  wipes the floor with the entire Transformers quadrilogy  ironically, produced by Spielberg.) With the sole exception of Hook, which I thoroughly despise, Ill even come to the defense of Spielbergs lesser-known, not-as-well-received efforts, such as Always (a dead Richard Dreyfuss extinguishing forest fires!) and Empire of the Sun (a young Christian Bale as a prisoner of war!). The director knows film magic, and each of his films contains at least several sequences of pure awe. Remember, hes the guy who made us believe in aliens, dinosaurs, and that a man can rip another mans heart out with his bare fingers.

Spielbergs films can be grouped into two categories: those that embrace his youthful, go-for-broke spirit and boundless imagination, and those that display a mellowed, somber, very mature side of the great director. Lately, hes been dabbling with the latter: the monochrome Munich dealt with terrorism; War Horse told a classical tale of a boy and his horse; Lincoln was a painting-in-motion, depicting a crucial moment in the Presidents life So I approached Bridge of Spies with a dose of caution, worried that its solemnity may induce a yearning for the audacious, lets-do-insane-freakin-sequences of, say, Minority Report.

My fears proved mostly groundless, as I sat gripped, from start to (almost) finish of this courtroom-cum-spy drama. Yes, the director again adopts a classical style of filmmaking Frank Capra would appreciate, but its so beautifully shot by his regular cinematographer extraordinaire Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can), and so eloquently written by Ethan and Joel Coen (no surprise there), that the subliminally tense story propels itself along, making the almost two-and-a-half hour run-time zip by. Spielbergs gleefully audacious side is intermittently evident too, especially in the moments of literary and visual humor, peppered throughout the films narrative. Spielbergs magic is on full display, making one  for the most part  overlook the minor flaws of Bridge of Spies.

The plot, in a nutshell: After an alleged Russian spy, Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), gets caught in an intense, precisely-choreographed opening sequence, set in the nuclear-1950s, a seasoned insurance lawyer, James Donovan (Tom Hanks), is assigned to defend him. A parallel story-line introduces a team of drivers being trained for a stealth-like mission to take photos of potentially hostile territories; another follows a young reporter, as hes arrested (for reasons that aren't quite defined) in the tumultuous, Cold War-stricken Berlin. The film switches from courtroom drama to espionage thriller, as Donovans journey takes him to Germany, where he has to negotiate a complex, triple-prisoner exchange.

That Spielberg hooks you from the first second is a given, given the directors captivating repertoire. There are many things going for Bridge of Spies. Mark Rylance is serene and intriguing as Abel, and Tom Hanks, who can do no wrong, gives a commanding central performance that anchors the film; his eyes just keep filling with wisdom as he grows older. Spielbergs filmmaking fluency is remarkable, per usual. The cinematography smoothly morphs from strikingly beautiful imagery of a plane soaring through a blue sky, to a pirouetting, nerve-shredding crash of said plane, to dismally gorgeous shots of the Berlin Wall being built in a grey, highly hostile environment.

Most importantly, the Coen brothers script evokes philosophical musings on the meaning of patriotism; the difference between enemy and criminal, cowardice and humanityThe film resolutely doesnt take sides. The East-German, Russian and U.S. agendas get muddled, each pursuing its own intentions, and one cant help but see the parallels between the films themes and the current horrific situation in Syria. It strikes a profoundly resonant note, without ever meaning to do it.

As Spielbergs biggest defender, I have to admit his films are almost never without flaws, and Bridge of Spies is no exception. The arrested journalist subplot is under-developed, while the U.S. drivers subplot is over-cooked; neither reveal much about the characters. The film loses momentum in its second half, and becomes tonally inconsistent. Sebastian Koch (The Lives of Others) hams it up as Wolfgang Vogel, and there is a confusing car-swerving-through-icy-Berlin scene that couldve been left on the chopping room floor. The music, by Thomas Newman, is just too much sometimes  another Spielberg trope. The triple-ending syndrome strikes the director once again; the guys prone to sentimentality, and he aint backing away from it!

Gripes aside, the director masterfully guides us through an intricate and powerfully poignant story. I thought it would be overtly patriotic, but its subjectivity, sensitive performances and humor keep it this side of nationalistic. My sole real objection would be: now its time for Spielberg to remember his roots, embrace his inner child again. I hope his next film will involve anthropomorphic manifestations of dreams, or parallel dimensions, or transgender space odysseys (yes, its quite obvious that I hoped  so much  that Spielberg would direct Interstellar dammit)  or reach new frontiers that only this cinematic wizard can dare to explore.",1453334400,10,6171,5.451781970649895

Hanks points out to the judge, as distasteful as the spy is, he didn't commit treason, he was merely working for his, the Russian government, not ours. Hanks tells the judge,""don't electrocute him, popular as that might be here in America, because we have American spies in Russia, too and we might want to swap our Russian spy for their potential  American spy at some point in the future"" ...A collaborative effort from Steven Spielberg and the Cohen brothers!

7441606,5,B015HM3E8K,"This movie is mainly factual, but not entirely ""true"" to the book, ""Strangers on a Bridge"", written by James B. Donavan.  I read Mr. Donavan's book back  in the mid '60's just after it was written.  I was in the U.S. military at the time and I developed a very strong admiration of Colonel Rudolf Able.  Colonel Able never denied being a Soviet Spy, but never divulged any information about his spy activities while in the United States.  A true Military Man, loyal to his country, (the USSR) and the secrecy of his military mission.  Colonel Able also acknowledged his gratitude to Mr. Donavon for the defense offered on his behalf after he returned to the Soviet Union.  I believe the exchange of the spies was beneficial for both the USSR and the USA.
 Mr. Donavan's book along with ""Operation Overflight"", by Francis Gary Powers, should be read to get a true insight to the treatment of both ""Spies"" by their respective capturers.",1452470400,,934,4.6871165644171775
7441607,3,B015HM3E8K,I was disappointed in this film. It was just fine. I just felt it was like so many of Tom Hanks' other movies. Good guys goes against the odds to do the right thing. Strong production values and good acting.,1452470400,6,207,4.2
7441608,5,B015HM3E8K,"I was born shortly before the Cold War ended, so I cannot imagine the fear and paranoia that people went through knowing that a nuclear doomsday could happen anytime.  My parents told me about the air raid drills at school and the fallout shelters that people bought just in case Russia pressed the button.  In my opinion, the threat of a war between the USA and the USSR was for more terrifying than terrorism is today.  That terror is captured perfectly in this film by Steven Spielberg about a single exchange of a suspected Russian spy and two Americans held behind enemy lines.

The film opens when a man is apprehended in America and charged with espionage.  Nobody wants to defend this guy since his defender would be seen as an absolute traitor themselves.  Lawyer James Donovan, played effortlessly by Tom Hanks, becomes the Russian's defender and must deal with extreme indifference by the American public and even threats to his and his family's lives.  Meanwhile, in Russia, an American pilot is shot down and taken into custody.  Unlike the Russian spy, who is treated well in the US, the pilot Francis Gary Powers is locked up in a brutal prison.  Eventually, must to the disgust of some of the American public, it is decided that Powers can be traded for the spy.  The plot thickens, however, when an American college student finds himself on the wrong side of the newly constructed Berlin wall.  He too is arrested, and now there is double jeopardy as Donovan must figure out if he can free both Powers and the student or if he can only free one (and if so, which one).

The film perfectly illustrates the sort of status quo that was an important element of the cold war.  It does this by focusing on one event that seems small but was actually monumental in the eventual resolution of the conflict.  By resolving the event, the USA and USSR established a sort of trust.  A trust that I'd like to think kept the world from entering World War III for decades.  Whether the trust started with the events depicted in Bridge Of Spies or whether it existed before is debatable, but it was there.  Without trust, the human race cannot function, and there would be no order or progress.  Spielberg's film, like many of his films, shows how people, despite their extreme differences can trust each other in order to advert disaster and establish order.

Aside from the main theme of the plot, I just think the film is a perfect snapshot of the cold war.  The scene of school children viewing footage of nuclear blasts will be familiar to older viewers of the film; many of them remember the conflict very well.  Also the scenes of the construction of the Berlin wall are downright haunting.  Imagine one day being free and the next you're a prisoner in a communist country.  Nightmares like that were very real for millions in those days.  It should be noted that the contrast between sunny America and the bleakness of snowy Berlin illustrates the contrast between free capitalist nations and the horrors of communist ones.  This reinforces the differences in the two sides and why the trust built between them is so remarkable.

After the pointless War Of The Worlds remake and the lackluster Indian Jones sequel ""Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"", I thought Steven Spielberg had lost it all together.  But he has clearly regained his touch with Bridge Of Spies, and I understand it when critics say this is his best since Saving Private Ryan.

7441611,4,B015HM3E8K,"Even knowing beforehand the whole story of Gary Powers' adventurous shot down in 1960 and the subsquent exchange of spies in Berlin, I really enjoyed this film. Steven Spielberg confirms once more that he is a magician of modern cinema and a charismatic story teller. The story is solid and engaging to follow, and the setting is beautifully detailed. As is becoming one of Spielberg's specialities, he's recreated the period with accomplished talent. He presents us the atmosphere of the early '60s in an incredible way, not avoiding to shoot outdoor scenes even in a crowded New York of the era! Tom Hanks gives a fantastic performance as always and Mark Rylance as Abel is also outstanding as a quiet and unassuming artist spying for the Soviets. Rylance played the role quietly without straining a facial muscle or once raising his voice above almost a whisper, but he was totally convincing and really shined. What was a nice surprise in my opinion in this film was the view of Soviet spy Abel as an honest patriot who simply did his duty. This is a gesture that finally breaks down the ideological barriers of the Cold War and recognises that the ""other side of the hill"" had a human face after all and a cause to serve. Although Spielberg used every trick in his quiver to bulid tension and fix the viewer, I think he didn't produce real surprises and he didn't reveal secrets that were not already known. Many times I felt that the director was too much predictable. Overall though it's one of the best films I have seen this year and I would happily see it again.",1450137600,,1572,4.637992831541219
7441612,4,B015HM3E8K,"Steven Spielberg is a veteran film maker who has earned his place in film history. ""Bridge of Spies"" will do nothing to diminish his standing.

Here's the scoop. Tom Hanks plays James B. Donovan, a lawyer for an insurance firm. The Feds want to hire him to secure the exchange of Francis Gary Powers (who was shot down over the Soviet Union in a spy plane) with a Soviet spy the Americans have arrested (and whom Hanks unsuccessfully represented at his trial). At the same time an American student is arrested in East Germany as a spy. The Berlin wall has just gone up and the Cold War is at its Zenith. Hanks needs to pull a rabbit out of his hat because he wants the release of the student along with Powers and needs to negotiate with the Soviets and the East Germans separately.

This is a very good flick. You get to see right off the bat that Hanks is a better than the average lawyer. He wants a fair trial for the Soviet spy because he believes in his heart that a fair trial for a Soviet spy shows America at its best. Of course that isn't going to happen so he now has another chance to do right by the spy, Powers and the student all in one shot. This sports a very savvy script. Hanks' Donovan is a tough cookie. He knows people and knows how to work them. He plays his cards right to the last second. They also get the Cold War paranoia thing down pretty well, though maybe the ""duck and cover"" thing has already become a cliche and could have been left out. They also achieve a great sense of time and place. The cars, wardrobe, places all make the viewer believe they are where the film makers say they are.

One small downside is Spielberg's need to revisit things later in the film that are set up early. One scene shows Hanks watching, in horror, as someEast Germans try to escape to the west and lose their lives in doing so. He balances this with a similar scene in New York where a group of kids hop fences in their neighborhood but with a different outcome. There are several, unnecessary, instances similar to this.

This might not be Spielberg's best film but it's a heck of a watch with another great performance by Tom Hanks. Put this on your list of must sees.",1449100800,4,2187,4.288135593220339
7441613,5,B015HM3E8K,"Saw it in a theater. In a nutshell, Donovan (Tom Hanks) is requested to defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) arrested and brought to court on charges of espionage for the USSR. Although Donovan was supposed to provide a fig leaf as a defender in a predetermined trial and verdict, he takes his role much too seriously for everybody (CIA, judge, and citizens ) in the apex of  the hysteria of cold war fears, just preceding the rise of the Berlin wall. He manages to convince the judge to sentence Abel to 30 years, instead of the electric chair that the public opinion pressures for. When Powers in his U-2 spyplane is shot down over Russia, Abel alive becomes an asset for bilateral exchange. Donovan is asked to negotiate the exchange of spies on behalf of the US and aquits himself magnificently. The movie is a most welcome break with the current genre that relies exclusively on never-stopping frantic and often senseless action scenes and mayhem galore, supported heavily by special effects. This is psychological drama, where one is forced to ponder what was the US then, and how the idea of justice changed over the years. The movie is clearly made by compleat professionals. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual, Mark Rylance is superb, and the rest of the actors (including the now aged Alan Alda) are very good, although a bit cartoonish. Spielberg directing is flawless, including excellent photography of bleak East Berlin, and the script shows scenes and dialogs hallmarking the Coen brothers. Nevertheless, the movie still bears the cliche approach that spoiled so many of Spieberg's masterpieces like the Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. Short of a masterpiece, it still deserves more than four stars.",1448755200,7,1718,4.944636678200692
7441614,5,B015HM3E8K,"Sometimes you have all the right talents coming together to create a masterpiece of a film.  Directed by Steven Spielberg (Lincoln, Schindler's List) from a screenplay by brothers Ethan & Joel Coen (Fargo, Oh Brother Where Art Thou?) and Matt Charman (Black Work), with Oscar-caliber performances by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance and a superb score by Thomas Newman, Bridge of Spies is one of those films.

The film begins in 1957 when tensions between the US and the Soviet Union were quickly ratcheting up and both sides were doing everything they could to spy on each other. We first meet an unremarkable-looking man (Mark Rylance) quietly painting a self-portrait in a small drab rented room in Brooklyn, NY. He receives a phone call to which he only listens and says nothing, then hangs up, gathers his painting materials, and heads out to a riverside bench where he proceeds to paint again. But as we watch, we discover that the man is a spy retrieving information that was left for him under the bench, and when he returns to his room, which is promptly raided by the FBI, we then learn as he is arrested that he is a Soviet citizen going under the name Rudolph Abel, one of many names he's used in his work.

The scene then shifts to a law office where one of the firm's senior partners, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is discussing an insurance claim with another lawyer representing claimants in an accident, and we are shown that Donovan is a man who uses words with dogged attention to clarity and precision of meaning as he negotiates how the claim is to be handled, never allowing himself to be distracted from what he perceives to be the heart of the matter. These traits are soon to be tested as he finds out later that he's being asked to defend Rudolph Abel, now the most hated man in the US.  Donovan is reluctant to say yes to the request, but in the end his belief in the Constitution's mandate that everyone, no matter what they're accused of, is entitled to a proper legal defense, will not let him say no. And so he meets Abel and begins to prepare his defense, knowing that it will make him the second-most hated man in the US.

The film then moves to introduce the third character in what will become one of the most famous incidents in Cold War history, an Air Force captain named Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who is being recruited by the CIA to be a pilot in their ultra-secret project to fly specially designed high-altitude U2 spy planes over the Soviet Union and photograph possible nuclear weapons sites. As fate would have it, Powers ends up being shot down on his first mission, captured by the Soviets and then tried as a spy.

All of this gradual build up leads to the central story of the film - how Donovan ends up being the unofficial behind the scenes negotiator between the US and the Soviet Union, who for political reasons cannot be seen to be even talking to each other, for a possible exchange of spies - Abel for Powers - in one of the tensest locations in the Cold War:  Berlin, right at the time that the Iron Curtain, particularly the notorious Berlin Wall, is going up.  With the additional complication of an American economics student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) who was also arrested in East Berlin and charged with espionage at the same time, whose case also comes to Donovan's attention. What happens is what makes up the rest of the film and is better simply seen than described in any way here. It is a mark of how well Bridge of Spies was done that you will be completely immersed in the events and the feel of the period, which some older viewers (like myself) may remember but younger generations have only read about.

The performances are all excellent, but Hanks and Rylance are far and away the stand-outs. Hanks (Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia) does a masterful job of bringing out Donovan's dogged dedication to both his clients and to what he feels are the principles that make up the foundation of American law and of basic justice. His performance also makes Donovan real as he struggles with the incredible strains of what he is called upon to do, a man thrown into a political battleground at the height of the Cold War and who has to keep a cool head, not only for himself but for the three men whose ultimate fate depends on what he negotiates for them, and for the two world powers edging dangerously close to going from a cold war to a hot one. Mark Rylance (Wolf Hall and a number of acclaimed stage roles) is quietly mesmerizing as the enigmatic Rudolf Abel, a man who seems perpetually imperturbable, resigned to his fate but unswerving from his silent dedication to his cause. But at the same time Rylance makes Abel human as well, aided by the superbly written dialogue between Abel and Donovan that the Coen brothers and Mark Charman provided them with.

One minor quibble I have with the film is that the way it unfolds gives the impression that the events being depicted happened fairly close together over a seeming matter of months or maybe a year when in fact they take place over a five-year period, from 1957 to 1962.  This was not intentional on the part of the film-makers, but it is the impression one receives nonetheless. It won't detract from one's enjoyment of the film, but I feel that it would've served history better to give a sense of the actual amount of time that was passing.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who appreciates sheer craftsmanship in film making and enjoys a thoroughly engaging telling of an important episode in the history of the Cold War.",1448582400,43,5588,4.5881763527054105

7441616,3,B015HM3E8K,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been so good together so many times that we just kind of accept it. We see the two of them on the marquee and quality is what is expected, if not outright excellence. This goes double when they're exploring great men of an earlier generation, men who honorably fought on the frontlines of war like in Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, or men who bravely traveled the final frontier in Apollo 13. In a year that's seen offbeat twists on the spy genre, Bridge of Spies is a welcome if somewhat antiquated throwback about a good man who does the right thing because it's the right thing to do.

The real life story concerns Brooklyn lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks), an upstanding family man (he comes to be known as the ""standing man"" for a reason) who is drafted by his firm into defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (the mesmerizing Mark Rylance), recently captured with a mountain of evidence against him. Abel is the ""most hated man in the country"" at a time when the Cold War was at its coldest, which by extension makes Donovan a hated man, too. He soon discovers the U.S. government only wants the appearance of due process, rather than a strong and spirited defense for Abel, who doesn't seem concerned about the trial at all.  Not even Donovan's family wants him to defend Abel, and the death threats they begin receiving don't help.

Bridge of Spies is essentially three separate films, and its the bookend sections that hold the greatest resonance. The first chapter when Donovan is defending Abel against the wishes of an entire country is Spielberg at his populist best, making powerful social commentary against our current policies in the post-Snowden era.  The middle section is where things get muddled and less thought-provoking. Donovan is convinced by a welcome (yet very suspicious) government to also negotiate the release of a captured U-2 spy plane pilot (Austin Stowell) from Soviet clutches. But Donovan, being the noble gent that he is, uses the opportunity to also seek the release of a captured college student on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. Turns out that Donovan's moral turpitude can be a real pain in the butt when it comes to international diplomacy.

But it's in the final section that Bridge of Spies evolves yet again, becoming the tried-and-true spy thriller most expected it to be in the first place. Donovan's mission in Europe is pure cloak-and-dagger stuff, or as he dismissively calls it after being robbed in the Berlin streets, ""spy stuff"". It's that gruff Irish attitude of Donovan's that make him more than just another altruistic, Jimmy Stewart-esque hero. Penned by the Coen Brothers, one can easily spot their comedic influence during Donovan's frequent negotiations with stiff Soviet agents and paranoid CIA operative. Despite a measured, deliberate pace, the film is never less than engrossing, thanks to Spielberg's deft direction and Hanks' engaging performance. The latter is arguably outmatched by Rylance as the enigmatic Abel, while Alan Alda and Amy Ryan provide solid support.

While there's very little that's flashy about Bridge of Spies, it looks absolutely stunning from a technical perspective, credit to DP Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman's score, on the other hand, is far too overbearing for a film that is completely built on restraint. It's especially noticeable in the final ""bridge"" scene, although to be fair we're talking about a literal bridge of spies. Complexity and subtlety is not what Bridge of Spies is ever going for, but if you leave the theater feeling incredibly patriotic then its job is done.",1448323200,18,3622,4.939244663382595

7441618,5,B015HM3E8K,"For over a half-century after the Second World War, from circa 1945 to 1990, the United States was involved in a ""war"" of sorts with the USSR we call the ""Cold War"". Barring the USSR's military engagements, such as in Afghanistan and other border countries, few died on other side as a result of this Cold War (and spy thriller novelists made a fortune). The Cold War was a continual chess match of adversarial confrontation and tension between the two world super-powers and their respective allies, notably the USSR and their eastern bloc allies of the Warsaw Pact and the United States and their NATO Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty. Non-violent conflicts were nearly never-ending, their chess pieces involving spies, intelligence, and espionage, each side trying desperately to gain the upper hand over their respective adversary, constantly moving their pieces to different areas of the board. When the two sides came to secret negotiating tables, they engaged the game like poker players, holding their cards close to their chests, neither side revealing any more about their hands than absolutely necessary. ""Bridge of Spies"" written by the Cohen Brothers with Matt Charman and directed by Steven Spielberg, chronicles one such as ""game"".

Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a.k.a. Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher, was an older unassuming man in a small Brooklyn apartment appearing to engage in painting projects. While under the guise of a painter, Abel was passing military secrets to Soviet agents. His cover was blown in 1957 when CIA agents raided his apartment and arrested him on charges of espionage and spying for the USSR. The US government appeals to Abel for help in their intelligence gathering in exchange for his release, but Abel declines.

James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a former Nuremberg Trial associate prosecutor, is working as an insurance-claim lawyer in a New York firm. His firm asks him to defend Abel as a publicity gesture to prove the US engages in fair trails, even for those who are charged with the highest-level crimes against the United States. (The film makes it seem like he was an associate attorney forced by his firm to take the case, although at the time, Donovan was in fact a senior partner of his firm Watters and Donovan.) Donovan reluctant agrees to take the case.

The respective lawyers, prosecutor and defender, meet with the trail judge who explains the trail is only for ""show"" to publicly send a message to the USSR and the world at large that the US Justice Department treats all defendants fairly and impartially, even with those accused of the most heinous of crimes against the state. However, behind closed doors, the judge indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. Donovan, who desires to be true to his case and his client disagrees, stating the trial should be taken seriously and not act only as a kind of international publicity stunt. Donovan then meets with his client where a mutual understanding is exchanged in which Abel makes clear he has no intention of cooperating with US intelligence authorities.

At first Donovan is perturbed at his client's reluctance to aid the CIA as it could mean the death penalty for Abel. However, as their attorney-client relationship evolves, Donovan begins to have respect for Abel. Abel was engaging in activities which other men in service to the United States are doing to the other side. In a profound statement, Abel says to Donovan that he hopes an American spy caught on the other side will also not be mistreated. In the only part of the film which was a bit weak, details of the actual trial are glossed over before Abel's inevitable conviction. In a surprising turn, the judge does not give Abel the death penalty but rather sentences him to a long prison term.

In a different storyline, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is a US fighter pilot recruited by the CIA to engage in intelligence gathering. Scenes between the Abel case and Powers interweave and we learn about the recruitment and training process for pilots who have been drafted into the Cold War conflict. They are now expendable chess pieces in the larger game. They learn about their equipment and their undercover tasks which is so secret they are forbidden even to tell All-Mighty God about their endeavors. At first, Powers' story seems to have little to do with the Abel case, except Powers and Abel are both intelligence-gatherers for the different sides of the Cold War. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan will be traveling to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall.

An absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression. This is one of the best directorial offerings by Spielberg since ""Lincoln"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the most riveting by the Cohen Brothers since ""No Country for Old Men"". Not to be missed, but it should be noted if you're looking for an action and suspense film similar to a Bond or Le Carre offering, ""Bridge of Spies"" is not that kind of story.",1448150400,4,5584,4.947761194029851
7441619,4,B015HM3E8K,"Steven Spielberg's new film ""Bridge of Spies"" is loosely based on events from the Cold War between the United States and the USSR in the late 1950s-early 1960's.  The United States had caught a Soviet Spy, Rudolph Abel, who was tried and sentenced to thirty years in prison after an unsuccessful appeal of his conviction to the Supreme Court.  The Soviets had captured Francis Gary Powers flying a U-2 spy plane late in the Eisenhower administration and sentenced Powers to ten years in prison. Early in the Kennedy administration, an exchange was worked out.

This film focuses on the activities of James Donovan in these events to offer a portrayal of a courageous private individual. According to some thoughtful reviews here on Amazon the film takes substantial license by expanding Donovan's role. This well may be the case.  For purposes of the film, however, it is valuable to see and admire a portrayal of quietly heroic American activity in the course of citizenship.

Donovan, an insurance attorney for a high-powered law firm, is asked to defend Abel from the espionage charge.  He and Abel develop a friendship as Donovan ignores the hostility of many other Americans, defends his client to the best of his ability within the law, and saves Abel from the death penalty.  Then, the CIA asks Donovan to assist in the proposed Abel-Powers swap. The film portrays Donovan as a sure, confident negotiator who works for the best possible result for the United States. He fulfills his mission and more.

The film portrays well the Cold War fear that gripped the United States. It shows as well the building of the Berlin Wall and the markedly bleak, repressive character of life in East Berlin. The film builds in dramatic tension to the Powers-Abel exchange held at a lonely, deserted bridge in the early hours of the morning. But the primary impression I took from the film was the portrayal of patriotism, courage and judgment in the characterization of James Donovan.  Tom Hanks offers a believable well-done portrayal of Donovan while Mark Rylance is convincing as Abel. The acting as good throughout and the background of the Cold War is well-established. For all the hysteria of the time, the importance of loyalty and courage in an American citizen stands out in this movie. I found this an appropriate and inspiring lesson to take to heart in the United States today.

7441622,4,B015HM3E8K,"If you're looking for James Bond spy stuff - well, keep looking. This is more a historical drama: a famous event in that un-war, starring a very un-famous character. I mean, what could be duller than a lawyer arguing down what his company has to pay?

Except, that's not what he's called on to do. First, he's named defense lawyer for a Russian spy. Pretty much everyone, down to the judge in the case, wants a fair trial and a hanging. Donovan (Tom Hanks's character) see it differently: if he's going to defend a case, he'll give it everything he has. Right through drive-by shootings at his house and right up to the Supreme Court. At first, this seems like one man standing for his own honor, carrying out his profession to the best of his very considerable ability, irrespective of cost. As the case advances through the courts, it turns into a trial of the American judicial system and the basic notion of fairness.

If legal stories float your boat, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-in-Gold/dp/B00VU4YO7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman in Gold</a>&nbsp;(which this reminds me of), that would have been enough. Instead, Donovan becomes an un-warrior in the un-war, working unacknowledged against three governments ready to start firing the missiles. A few gritty scenes bring back the grim reality of the Berlin Wall and what it really divided. Really, I'm not one for lawyer dramas, but this one kept my attention.

But I have to rate this according to my own tastes, which won't match everyone's. At core, this is a historical drama, and I'm not one for history. I would have given it a pass, except that my wife suggested it and she sees movies I pick. This is well done, beyond doubt, but I can't imagine wanting to see it again.

7441623,4,B015HM3E8K,"Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg reteam for ""Bridge of Spies"", the tale of an unassuming tax lawyer from New York who agrees to handle the unofficial negotiations leading to a prisoner exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.

James Donovan (Hanks) is recruited to defend Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, ""Wolf Hall""), a spy captured in New York in the late 50s. Donovan is a little surprised - basically a tax attorney he has little experience with criminal trials - but he agrees because everybody deserves a proper defense. As the case goes on, and the publicity increases, his family receives threats, causing his wife, Mary (Amy Ryan) to have second thoughts about whether James should be working on the case at all. Meanwhile, the US begins a project to send spy planes over the Soviet Union, recruiting pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell, ""Whiplash"", ""Dolphin Tale""), to fly one of the first missions. He is quickly shot down and taken prisoner. Donovan learns the Soviets might be interested in trading Abel for Powers, but it has to be negotiated unofficially in East Berlin. To complicate matters, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an American student, gets caught behind the Berlin Wall and arrested. Donovan wants to negotiate for both men, but the US government insists Powers, with his knowledge of military planes and missions, is the target. But Donovan insists on bringing both men home to the United States.

""Bridge of Spies"" is Spielberg at his most simple. We see everything happen as it probably did happen, the characters don't digress into emotional histrionics, there aren't a lot of obvious special effects, the music doesn't swell up throughout to key you to the emotions you should be feeling. Spielberg is simply letting the story unfold in a more natural way, using the performance of Hanks to accentuate the key details. It takes a moment or two to get used to, but once this happens, you begin to appreciate this and just let the story unfold, enjoying the inherent drama and suspense.

That is not to say that Spielberg doesn't put a lot of craft into this film. As a period piece, everything about this film is fabricated in some way - he can't simply tell this story on the streets of New York and expect us to ignore the modern cars. The attention to detail is impeccable - you never once forget that you are watching a story set in the late 50s and early 60s. The one nod to a stylistic flourish seems to be that anytime there is a bright window in a shot, the light from outside seems to glow and infuse the entire scene, making parts of the shot hard to see. This infuses the story with a lyrical, romantic quality, which may seem a little strange, but it works and gives the film a slightly burnished look. It almost looks like a film made during this period.

""Bridge"" is also a bit slower paced. One story unfolds, giving you time and space to be with that narrative, to get used to it. Then, when one of the other story lines begins, we move there and that bit unfolds until we get to another place in the chronology and move to another of the story threads. No intercutting, no flashforwards or flashbacks, nothing tricky in the narrative that might call attention to the fact this is a film, being directed by someone like Spielberg. Again, refreshing that someone as revered as Spielberg has the maturity and ability to just let the story unfold.

Strangely, this ability to let everything unfold at a slower, more natural pace also creates more suspense. Because we aren't so hyped up by the rest of the film, when an actual tense moment does happen, it is much more effective.

Thankfully, the score for this film was created by Thomas Newman (""Saving Mr. Banks"", ""Skyfall"", ""Spectre""). There are many scenes with no music at all, allowing the audience to feel the emotion they want to feel, not something cued by swelling music. Often, Spielberg uses a well-respected composer to work on his films, someone who blankets music throughout, leaving nary a moment of silence. But they were unavailable, leading him to work with this new collaborator. I think he should continue to work with Newman.

A lot of the success of the narrative of ""Bridge of Spies"" lies with the work of the screenwriters. Written by Matt Charman and Ethan & Joel Coen (the writers and directors of ""Fargo"", ""No Country For Old Men""), they lay the groundwork for the story's more relaxed narrative. Also, the characters populate the story, doing what they have to do to keep the narrative moving. If they are no longer a part of the story, they move on. Some return much later when they are called upon again. These are all decsions made initially by the writers. In Hollywood, punctuation and words like 'and' in the credits usually are quite significant. I will guess that Matt Charman (""Suite Francaise"") wrote the original screenplay and the Coen Brothers were brought in to do a polish, giving some of the characters or parts of the narrative a little rewrite. That said, their work seems pretty seamless and helps to create compelling characters and an engrossing story.

This is really Tom Hanks' film. He is front and center as James Donovan, the tax attorney who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two kids. Initially reluctant to get involved in a case that no one could win, his sense of commitment takes over and he follows the case through to it's end. Then, when the two Americans are captured, he is determined to win the release of both despite the constant remonstrations from the government officials that Powers is the real target, not the student. He continues to work his way through various bureaucratic circles as he works towards a resolution.

Hanks portrays Donovan as quiet, respectful, slightly annoyed. It is not a performance filled with big monologues - except when Donovan addresses the Supreme Court (there had to be one, I guess) - and big emotion. You get the sense that Donovan isn't that guy and Hanks sticks to this throughout.

Mark Rylance plays Abel. I haven't seen Rylance in a lot of other work. A British actor with a reputation for some amazing stage work, he is slowly making his way into film and television roles. As Abel, he seems perfectly matched to Donovan. They are really the same man, but from different parts of the world and their temperaments match perfectly. As they meet and talk with each other, you can see respect build between them, a respect that transcends the fear and histrionics of many others in the society and government are experiencing.

Amy Ryan is also very good as Mary, Donovan's wife. Quiet and supportive, you can see why their relationship has lasted for many, many years.

And throughout the cast, many other recognizable actors pop up in smaller roles, giving their sometimes quick moments giving the story a sense of gravity and believability. Alan Alda plays the senior partner at Donovan's firm, Jesse Plemons (TV's ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Fargo"") plays Powers mission training partner. And there are many others. Usually, this type of thing can be distracting - oooh, look who it is - but in ""Bridge"", these appearances help create a richer tapestry.

All in all, ""Bridge of Spies"" is a very watchable, very interesting view of a significant piece of history. You would expect nothing less from Spielberg and Hanks.

But because everything is sort of low key, all the time, it makes us feel like we are watching a docu-drama. It's difficult to explain, but because of this - which is the same reason I liked the film - you always feel like you are watching something, you don't really fully connect with the story and this makes this a very good film. Not a great film.",1446681600,,7725,4.7338289962825275

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

What motivated Steven Spielberg to go ahead and take on a project such as ""Bridge of Spies?"" I've read that it was simply his nostalgia for the Cold War era, firmly ensconced in his childhood memories. Unfortunately, the vehicle to tell that storythe combined tale of the capture and trial of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel and swap for the downed US pilot Gary Powers on Russian soilpacks little punch due to its obvious lack of suspense.

The ""Bridge of Spies"" narrative can be easily summarized in a short paragraph: the US government unofficially conscripts insurance lawyer James Donovan to defend Soviet spy Abel after he's captured by the Feds in Brooklyn. The trial is a foregone conclusion but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence Abel to prison instead of death since he could be used in a prisoner exchange in the future. Sure enough, after Gary Powers is shot down in his U2 spy plane, Donovan is again called upon to negotiate a prisoner swap with the Russians. A wrench is thrown into the negotiations when a US graduate student is arrested as a spy by the East Germans. Donovan deftly negotiates the swap of Abel for both Powers and the American student, and the exchange is facilitated with little incident.

As historical incidents related to the Cold War go, the Abel-Powers narrative is hardly one of high drama. A major problem is that Donovan has no single, strong antagonist to play off of. The negotiations with his Soviet counterpart, a KGB agent masquerading as a diplomat, are a forgone conclusion. We know of course that the spy swap will be successful, so where is the suspense? The ""heart-pounding"" moment is hardly heart pounding at allas Abel and Powers are about to exchange places, there is a slight delay before the East Germans deliver the American student to complete their part of the bargain.

Yes of course I understand that Donovan dramatically threatened the East Germans, as they could have been blamed by the Russians for sabotaging the spy swap. But their decision was really a forgone conclusion too, as the East Germans were always under the yoke of the Russians, and were in no position to act independently (balking at giving up the student of course was their way of ""saving face"").

With all this lack of suspense, it was incumbent upon Mr. Spielberg's screenwriters (including ""luminaries"" Joel and Ethan Coen) to manufacture a series of fictional events to spice up a ""thriller"" that hardly thrills at all! Here a few examples: spectators at Abel's sentencing did not loudly object to the no death penalty sentence; Donovan and family were not victims of a drive-by shooting; Donovan's coat was not stolen by a gang in East Berlin (in reality, Donovan merely observed a gang nearby) and Donovan never personally observed people being killed as they attempted to climb over the Berlin Wall.

Spielberg's attempt to recreate the era is rife with numerous gaffes. Early on Donovan is seen riding in a in a NYC R-32 subway car that first went into service in 1964 (the scene is set in 1961). That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the interior of the car appears to be from the 70s and beyond, and not 1961. The gaffes, which include anachronisms, character error, continuity, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes, revealing mistakes and miscellaneous errors are all detailed under the Bridge of Spies ""Goofs"" section on IMDb.

""Bridge of Spies"" is not a complete loss as the film features some excellent acting by Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy Abel. With its 40 million dollar budget and decided lack of suspense, I wonder why the film was made in the first place. It of course gives Spielberg an opportunity to peddle a rather simplistic and obvious message: there were some bad people on the other side of the Iron Curtain (faceless soldiers shooting people trying to escape over the Berlin War) but also individuals such as master spy Abel, who end up displaying unexpected glimpses of humanity.",1446508800,15,4056,4.817528735632184

 Ok, Seven Spielberg directs Tom Hanks for the fourth time.  We expect something extraordinary and we get something magnificent.  In every respect this film satisfies.  Hanks just keeps on getting better and better as he gets older.  The meticulous attention to detail lavished on the film by director Spielberg has not been equaled in recent memory.  The script by Ethan and Joel Coen has a solid feel illuminated at frequent intervals by brilliance.  I liked this one a lot.
 Some of us will remember the events in the film as part of our personal life memorabilia.  For the other, younger viewers, this film has a genuine basis in fact.  At the end of the Eisenhower administration the U2 (yes, that is where the band got its name) spy plane had just been put in operation.  Unlucky Francis Gary Powers had the misfortune of being shot down on a photo mission 70,000 feet above the Soviet Union.  Living through the experience, he suffered captivity by the Godless Communists that then ran that sorrowful nation.
 At more or less the same time our FBI captured a Soviet agent, a KGB officer living quietly in New York City and running an operation there.  Naturally, we wanted our pilot back safe and sound.  The communists wanted their agent back.  It seems like Kismet, no?  A simple swap, everybody gets something and we can get on with our business. Nope, nothing is as simple as it seems.  While the negotiations go on the communist government of East Germany builds the Berlin Wall and ruthlessly shoots citizens trying to escape bondage and breathe the free air of the West.
 Tom Hanks plays James Donovan, an insurance attorney of all things, who gets conscripted to make the arrangements.  The Soviets do not want to publicly acknowledge their agent so there can be no government to government talks.  To complicate matters further, a young American student gets snatched by the East German communists and held as a lever to force the American government into recognizing their government.
 This seems like a complicated, not to say tangled, story and of course it is.  But the script by the Coen brothers helps us keep up.  Also appearing is Alan Alda as the lawyers boss.  In a tiny role as an FBI agent Domenick Lombardozi (The Wire) underplays his usual bombastic self.  Amy Ryan had a very small role as Mrs. Donovan, the worried wife of the negotiator which she accomplished with grace and subtlety.
 This outstanding film runs for two hours and 21 minutes and will surely get a flock of Oscar nominations.  It has a mild PG-13 rating.  The budget of $40 million has returned $45 million in its first week at the box office.
 Watch all the way for a truly wonderful few moments of film making. Spielberg has his actors work without words for the last moments of the film.  How can an actor invoke tears while not saying a word?
 In real life the insurance man was not such a wild card as a negotiator.  He served in the OSS as general counsel in WWII and also as a prosecutor at the Nuremburg war crimes trials.
 Movie fun-watch for the Berlin theater marquee.  The theater is showing  Eins, Zwei, Dre, the German name of the American film of the time One, Two, Three, a film involving people caught up in East Berlin, West Berlin problems.  Spielberg is the man.",1446249600,,3297,4.661458333333333

Cast: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Alan Alda, Jesse Plemons, and Austin Stowell

Recently Tom Hanks went on The Tonight Show and did a Kid Theater skit where he performed scripts written by elementary school kids who were told to write a scene for a movie called Bridge of Spies.  Most of them involved either a bridge made of spies or spies on a bridge.  Imagine my surprise when I arrived at the climax of Steven Spielbergs latest film, Bridge of Spies and a group of spies met on a bridge.  This is no slight on the actual films screenplay as the scene is actually quite riveting, but more a testament to this films transparent nature in that what you see is what you get  quite rare for a spy film.

This is the fourth pairing of Steven Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks as actor.  Each film theyve done together has been a period piece of sorts with a true story at its core.  Bridge of Spies is no exception.  In it, Hanks plays James Donovan, a partner in a successful New York insurance law firm at the height of the Cold War.  When a suspected Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is captured by the FBI, Donovan is recruited to provide a credible defense in a trial designed to railroad this spy right to the electric chair.  Donovans duty as an American trumps his hesitation for taking a losing battle and he agrees to take the case.  From this point on, Spielbergs film ceases to be a did he or didn't he film (he did), and begins a fascinating exploration into the murkiness, hypocrisy, and complexity of espionage during one of American historys most turbulent periods.  Abel is not depicted as an enemy but as a cautious, thoughtful man doing an important job for his country in a time of unrest.  His story is paralleled by another depicting the training and deployment of Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot for the CIA who is later shot down in his spy plane over Russia.  In the wrong hands, these stories could come across as preachy or downright absurd, but thankfully the Coen brothers crafted the screenplay and tell an intelligent story about perspective rather than a heroic tale of valor.  In one early scene, Donovan is seen discussing one of his clients responsibilities for paying a claim to a victim who wants five times the settlement because a driver ran into five motorcycle drivers.  Donovan goes on to explain that to the victim five things happened but according to the insurance policy, one thing happened.  This conversation holds new meaning when Donovans life as one type of lawyer leads him to act as an entirely different type of lawyer and that two sides of a seemingly black and white conflict are actually one.

Powerss and Abels stories converge with a prisoner exchange plot that holds Donovan firmly in the middle.  Hanks embodies Donovans struggle with great appeal.  He is born to play roles like this and Spielberg knows it.  In fact, Spielbergs cinematic voice has been diminished lately by the enormous shadow cast by his actors and screenwriters.  With Lincoln it felt like Spielberg simply had to put the camera on a tripod and let Daniel Day-Lewis have his way with Tony Kushners script.  The same formula is at work with Bridge of Spies.  Spielberg is certainly gifted at his attention to detail as this film drips with authenticity, and some of his transitions are enlightened and stark, but ultimately this films success rests on Hanks and the screenwriting of Charman and the Coens.  Also, Rylances subdued performance as Abel is understated but pivotal. Several times throughout the movie, he is relegated to utter the schmaltzy phrase, would it help? as a little inside joke between Donovan and himself, but it works every time.

Furthermore, Bridge of Spies follows some conventional storytelling arcs, but the spy genre is not one easily transformed.  The key to Bridges success is that its agenda is not to trick the audience but rather to let us hold all of the cards and experience the weight of each decision that is made.

The story centers around insurance attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) who was requested to defend an accused Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in a US kangaroo court at great risk to his own personal safety and that of his family. I will avoid the plot spoiler details, but we know historically he would go on to negotiate the spy exchange for downed pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell).

As a history buff I found the details (even if they may have been inaccurate) interesting as they weaved a tale demonstrating the ability of an insurance lawyer to negotiate. Tom hanks nailed it.

Tom Hanks plays Cold War figure James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer who defends a Russian spy arrested in America and is then tasked with negotiating his exchange for a pair of American prisoners in Berlin.

What did I think?

No one knows how to move a film camera like Spielberg, and Bridge of Spies shows that hes still on his game. Hes got a great cast to work with, best of which is Mark Rylance, who plays the Russian spy with understated charm. The first half has some terrific suspense sequences and character moments, and while theres less of those to enjoy in the procedural-like happenings of the second half, the ending drives the emotion home and makes the whole film well worth seeing.",1445558400,2,718,4.59375

7441633,5,B015HM3E8K,"In some ways, there's nothing much to say about Bridge of Spies. I mean, it's Spielberg, and we've all come to accept a particular quality about a Spielberg movie, and I don't just mean its ""goodness"" quality. Spielberg movies have a certain finish to them that no one else can replicate and, so, this movie is a Spielberg movie and is everything you've come to expect from one.

Also, it's Tom Hanks, and Hanks isn't stretching himself beyond being Hanks in this one. Of course, as with Spielberg, that comes with a particular level of quality, which means he's excellent as James Donovan. Or he's excellent at being Hanks as Donovan. Let's just say he didn't push himself into some other mold as he did in Saving Mr. Banks and Cast Away.

Mark Rylance, though, is great. Maybe it's that I'm not really familiar with him as an actor, but he is great in his role as Rudolf Abel.

Of course, the main issue with judging the acting is that there is nothing to compare these roles to. I mean, there is no model of behavior to compare Hanks' portrayal of Donovan against, not like there was with his portrayal of Walt Disney or Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln. In that, we have to take the characters as they appear on screen, which, maybe, is why Hanks is ultimately just Hanks. He's not trying to be a particular James Donovan, just a Hanks James Donovan.

All of which is to say that this is a finely acted movie with high production values, exactly what you'd expect. And the history seems to be pretty spot on, which is something I find important.

And I really enjoyed it. It's a good spy movie, much in the vein of the two George Smiley BBC series with Alec Guiness, especially the section where the CIA sends Donovan into East Germany, a man with no ""spy training"" -- he's just a lawyer -- and tells him to just feel the situation out and figure out what to do.

I don't know that it's actually an Oscar-level movie, neither the movie itself nor Hanks, but it's good. Really good. If you don't know anything about the time period, it's definitely worth seeing.",1445472000,,2064,4.490666666666667
7441634,5,B015HM3E8K,"The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War.  During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot.  In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always quite high.  Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielbergs 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary directors career.

Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity.  Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.

Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft.  Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961.  Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.

With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam.

Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear.  But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic.  BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcocks classic films.  The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the directors 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLERS LIST).  Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process.  Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the Bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.

Because John Williams, Spielbergs long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywoods illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newmans score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues.  Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks and Rylances performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history.",1445385600,2,4737,4.701690821256038
7441635,5,B015HM3E8K,"Wow!  Steven Spielberg continues to be endlessly creative with his filmmaking, and continues to share his passion about American ideals.  He's also very good at recreating another time period and making it seem real instead of artificial, and since he grew up during the 50s and 60s, he can do this truly well in Bridge of Spies.  The story of Bridge of Spies covers so much territory, geographically and thematically, that only a truly passionate director could combine it all so seamlessly.  The transition shots are sometimes very creative, like a parachute in one scene becoming a fan in a room in the next scene.  I love how Spielberg is able to create a powerful emotional experience with only a few moments of showing the brutality of the Berlin Wall from a distance, then later recreate those emotions with a reminder as Tom Hanks sees kids climbing a fence in America--the way it's done in the movie is brilliant.  Spielberg's visual imagination has always been part of his genius.  (This movie has a shot where the hat is in the foreground and the people's positions are really similar to the last shot of Indy's first meeting with Walter Donovan on the Last Crusade movie.)

The strong moral impulse of the movie comes from Tom Hanks's character, a historic person named James Donovan, defying everyone else's pragmatism in pursuit of equal justice for all.  He starts by representing a captured accused Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel, but then has to go in the role of a US citizen to represent, indirectly, the US government in negotiating the release of the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, in exchange for Abel.  He will not back down, however, until he also negotiates the release of an American student who was captured in East Berlin.  The political negotiations are done in a way that is never boring or confusing.  I savor every shot of the movie because of Janusz Kaminski's cinematography (Steven Spielberg's cameraman since Schindler's List), and because of everyone's acting.  (Tom Hanks makes a scene work just by being himself, in no matter what role he does, like Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart!)  I love the way the movie starts and the way Donovan's family learns about his negotiating role after he gets back--ingenious filmmaking!  It is also rich with an idealism about American values, which is not that common in movies.  I was really looking forward to this movie, and it's even better than I expected!",1445299200,,2431,4.835748792270532
7441636,5,B015HM3E8K,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  Never underestimate Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, especially when they team up to make a movie.  In one of the best dramatic films of the year, the story expands on real events surrounding the downing of a CIA spy plane over Russia in 1960.  The film begins in 1957 when a suspected Russian agent, Rudolf Abel (wonderfully portrayed by Mark Rylance) is captured by the FBI.  The grandfatherly-like Abel, doesnt deny his activities, but never discloses any information to the Americans.

As he goes to trial for a crime that could include the death penalty, the judge appoints a well-known law firm to represent Abel.  The head of the firm, Thomas Watters, Jr. (Alan Alda) appoints James Donovan (Tom Hanks) to handle the case.  Donovan is a bit surprised because, he practices insurance law and hasn't worked on criminal cases in years.  As Donovan learns later, Watters and Judge Byers (Dakin Matthews) expect a competent defense to show how the American justice system works, but clearly minds have been made up.  About all that is left is when the death penalty will be carried out.

Donovan discovers that a search warrant was never issued for evidence used in the case.  But the judge rejects Donovans plea.  When Donovan appeals, both he and his family come under fire, both figuratively and literally.  While his appeal to the Supreme Court narrowly fails, Donovan is able to convince Byers to sentence Able to a long prison term rather than execution.  His compelling argument is that there are spies on both sides and Able may come in handy in the future if one of our guys is caught.  And sure enough, the prescient Donovan is correct.  Shortly afterwards, Francis Gary Powers and his U2 plane is shot down over Russia.  He is captured alive (much to the chagrin of the CIA), put in prison, interrogated and subsequently sentenced to a long term.

During this time, the Cold War was at its height.  The Berlin Wall was under construction separating the city and Germany into 2 states.  One controlled by America and Western Europe and one by the Soviet Union.  As residents scrambled to get to the West, an American student, Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) is taken prisoner by the East Germans.  It turns out he will be key in the final negotiations.  The Soviets and the Americans decide that a prisoner exchange should take place, but neither government wants to acknowledge the collusion, so the negotiations are carried out by civilians.  Donovan is recruited.  He has now gotten to know Able quite well and likes him if not his assignment.

Tom Hanks is perfect as the everyman lawyer.  His conviction of what makes America great goes beyond flag waiving and reciting the pledge of allegiance.  He believes in what makes the country great is more, including Constitutional guidelines and justice.  Fifty years ago, Donovan would probably be played by Henry Fonda or James Stewart.  The film is beautifully photographed.  Watch for the color changes, not only from America to Russia but especially between East and West Berlin.  The scenes in the East are only brightened by snow but even that has a murky tint.  The cat and mouse negotiations between Donovan and his contacts with the Soviets (who hold Powers) and the East Germans (who hold Pryor) is brilliant as is Hanks portrayal.  Highly recommended.  One of the best films of the year.",1445212800,212,3397,4.867364746945899
