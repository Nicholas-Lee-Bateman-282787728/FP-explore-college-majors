This extremely moving series is a must-see for the whole family! It is a continuation of the award-winning series and are true to form! The filmmakers did an excellent job in selecting the events pertaining to that era along with the many very revealing interviews.
I was a teen during the Civil Rights movement and was an eye witness to many of the events covered in the series. Only difference is that I was growing up on the east coast and not the south. I mention that because I was actually taken back to those times as I viewed this awesome series. These informative and very well put together videos are in color,and are of surprisingly very decent quality, considering the age of the series and unlike the first set( which carries its own weight in black and white, regardless!). The sign of the times demand this very riveting reminder of how far we've come as a nation of and for all races. This series, in my opinion, should be included as required viewing in public school curiculum all across this great country of ours. No longer should we wait till January-February time frame to knock the dust off of this and similar resources, for we will miss out on one of the most life changing periods in American history! If we took the time to sit the kids down and as a family spend true quality time reliving the struggles of a people as shown in this very powerful series, maybe we'd see less underwear from today's kids wearing their pants halfway to the ground, and more proof that their labor was not in vain!",1201478400,2,1717,4.965277777777778
