The foreman of the jury that convicts the women is a tortured  soul. So is his daughter. She seems to have internalized the condemned woman's plight. The foreman also seems to be very chummy with the prosecuting DA. The daughter is in love with a shady character. That where Bogart comes in. At this point it's really no spoiler to discover he has been murdered. That very night he decides to dump her. She doesn't take it well. She confesses the whole thing to her family. Her father the foreman calls the DA. Still that night he comes right over. They begin to spin her confession. To have a women murder her lover the same way on the same night another women is being executed is very dicey for the foreman as well as the DA. Especially if it is the foreman's daughter. That's it in a nutshell. Good late night fare.",1259366400,,933,4.424418604651163
996931,2,6305248036,"Looks as if it was written and directed by a couple of kids still at school. I can remember being in amateur theatricals like this when I was about 16 or 17. The director has a few visual ideas; eg, the wooden bars of a staircase banister turn into the iron bars of the condemned cell. Not that there's a lot of point to that one. The upshot of the story is that it's right to pursue the letter of the law, no matter how unpopular it makes you, or how strong your psychological empathy with the accused --- even if she's your own daughter. Quaint, in a way. Yes, Bogart is in it, just about. Was this his first turn as a baddie, after playing matinee idols?",1160092800,,657,4.140625

VERY MELODRAMATIC & over acted like a silent movie! It is the movie itself that I rate 3 stars. This is for devoted Bogart fans who want to experience his early work.  He is only a supporting player who appears in less than half the movie, yet his character steals the show. His acting style stands out from the others and you can for-see the potential for his future.

997037,3,6305248036,"This is a strange flick. A jury foreman stands on principle (""the law is the law; I am but an instrument!') and sentences a woman to death for murder, only to find his own daughter up on a murder charge shortly thereafter (the night of the execution, actually!). It's not clear whether she actually committed he murder but she shows up with the murder weapon and all too eager to confess her crime. The local DA manages to to persuade her, the family,  and the viewers that she didn't really commit the crime? Or did she, and he was engaging in psychological subterfuge to ensure that ""good people"" don't go to the chair for crimes that only those other people commit? Hmmm. It's all rather naive, but this is 1934, and such was the state of budget noire then, especially with unknowns like this Humphrey Bogart dude cast as the ""wrong boy"" for the the jury foreman's daughter. Where do they get these people anyway? Obviously he had no future in pictures. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen; it was more amusing than anything else.

And to see a young and handsome Bogie was wonderful.
I am a fan also always enjoyed seeing his movies.
Although his time was short in this movie it might of been.
Because he was young and starting out in his acting career.
But don't take my word for it I am not an expert just a fan.
Crime of passion is so much different back then compared to today.
Crimes back then may have been few compared to today by women.
Women today may have become more out spoken and more demanding.
Once again I say I am not an expert on this type of issues concerning women.
Would I say to others watch this movie. I would say yes and they would have to decide for themselves.

997107,2,6305248036,"First off, I'm reviewing the movie, not the physical DVD product. This is an early film featuring Bogart that would surely be forgotten if he wasn't in it. The other actors are melodramatic and the story, even with its ""twist"" ending, is a bit too mechanical to enjoy. Bogart is the best thing about it, but people didn't seem to realize it at the time and his role is not that big. As usual at this time he played a gangster type, and I don't want to give anything away, but I swear that Bogart got shot to death more than any other actor in the 1930s!

I'm a huge Bogart fan and I've sought out anything I could find with him. This is worth seeing once if you also love Bogart, but if you're just a casual film viewer, avoid it. There's plenty of better Bogart films.",1334793600,,769,4.195945945945946
997108,3,6305248036,"I have been on something of a Humphrey Bogart tear of late. And when I get on the occasional tear I tend to grab everything of an author, singer, artist, or actor in sight. And hence this review of very much lesser known Humphrey Bogart film, Call It Murder.  If you are looking for the Humphrey Bogart of  To Have or To Have Not,  Casablanca, The Big Sleep or even The Petrified Forest then you will be disappointed. Bogart plays a relatively minor role as, well what else, a second- rate cheap hoodlum whose heading out of town fast, or so that is his plan. So no one should be offended if you pass this one by.

Pass by is what I originally intended  to do as  well except when I thought about it this film is actually a very good example of the kind of social film critique that was popular and produced during the turbulent and trying 1930s. The subject here is the death penalty, its application, and its basic appropriateness in an evolving progressive society (or that has pretensions to civilization). The plot line centers on a woman who has killed her abusive husband when he was going to run out on her leaving her high and dry. At trial the foreman of the jury, a self-righteous and upright citizen, persuades his fellow jurors that she is guilty of murder one, and hence headed for the electric chair. Since there was no ""battered person"" defense then she was convicted and sentenced to die.

 The dramatic tension of the film comes when that self-righteous juror is bombarded with pleas from all kinds of sources to call for sparing her life. He maintains his stance and she is executed. And here is where Bogie comes in. He has been seeing the juror's daughter, she has fallen in love with him, and as mentioned before, he is ready to fly to the coop. Naturally she is ready to move might and main to keep him in the coop. Well one thing leads to another as they do with thugs and he is shot to death. She thinks that she has done it in a rage at his leaving. She runs home to dear old dad and tells her story. Hey, she is up for murder one and the chair too, right?  No way in the end of course but the old man has to confront, or rather we have to confront, that little moral dilemma when thing hit just a little to close to home.

Good thoughtful social critique on the death, agreed?  Yes, although I should note that this film is one of those 1930s Theater Guild productions which tended, as this film, does to be rather heavy-handed and didactic in making its important point. Thus the dialogue, the staging, and the acting are rather stilted for today's audiences. Still it mad that nice social commentary. Just don't see for the Bogie part, okay.",1328313600,2,2670,4.373737373737374

7886045,2,6305248036,"Midnight (AKA Call It Murder)
This is a 1934 movie that is a version of a German film, and as such it is assumed that appropriate compensation for differences between the German and American criminal justice systems has been made.
The story centers about Edward Weldon, foreman in a contemporary American jury trial in which a young woman [Ellen Saxton] is alleged to have murdered her boyfriend in a crime of passion. The opening scene is the courtroom in which the trial takes place. Because Ellen Saxton has admitted to the court that she took money from the victim after shooting him thus making it appear that the crime was premeditated, she is found guilty of murder in the first degree and is sentenced to death. The trial appears to have been proper and fair in every respect. Any mitigating circumstances were apparently left for appeal and that was inexplicably not done, although late appeals to the warden were attempted to no avail.
The foremans daughter, Stella Weldon, about the same age as Ellen Saxton, is in the court audience sitting next to a young man, Gar Boni, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the verdict is announced, Boni turns to Stella and states that had the guilty woman had a better lawyer, she could have beaten the rap. Bogarts character is that of a seedy gang member. The alleged injustice perceived by the press and public at large seems more with the sentence than the verdict, and suggests the film is a vendetta against capital punishment.
The remainder of the movie concerns the angst that Edward Weldon, the jury foreman, goes through as the execution date approaches. He avers that he is a strict law and order man, and feels confident in his decision despite being mercilessly hounded by the press and public. The crime of murder must be dealt with justly by the law. At that time society had decided that felons given a verdict of murder in the first degree should be put to death.
Meantime, Stella sets up a meeting with Gar Boni before he leaves town for Chicago the night of the execution. Just prior to that meeting, she finds out that Boni is cheating on her, she then meets him in his car down the street from her house. He tells her their relationship is over, and in a mad fit of passion she murders him with his own gun.
She, with gun in hand, walks home into her living room and confesses to her father, and the immediate family that she had just murdered Boni. Her father is urged to call the DA Plunkitt who knows him from the previous trial. He does call the DA and asks that he come to the house. That night, DA Plunkitt comes to Stellas home and is told of the deed. She is still in shock from the murder. Without any pleading or prompting by anyone, DA Plunkitt questions Stella in such a way as to concoct an alibi for her, the cover being this will be an unsolved gangland murder. Stella is relieved and her father is dumbfounded. Conclusions: The filmmakers apparent intent is that the audience leave the theater with a distaste for capital punishment, and a sense that with slick lawyering, the criminal justice system could be manipulated. Ironically Stella, unlike Ellen Saxton, probably will not be charged with a felony.
Directorial discretion could have improved the pace of the films exposition. For example, the prolonged almost hourly countdown to the execution, while serving a purpose of the film, could have been shortened. Also minor characters and a subplot that had no relevance to main story could have been eliminated. Character development was inconsistent reflecting problem scripting, and that was compounded by the actors superficial interpretations of their roles. Young Humphrey Bogart had a bit part, but played the bad Bogie as we know and love him. Regarding the authors pitch against capital punishment and the integrity of our criminal justice system, it would be worthwhile to compare our system to those in countries with better legal systems, if there are any.",1467936000,,3953,4.747093023255814
