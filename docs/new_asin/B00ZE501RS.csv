7276818,5,B00ZE501RS,"i would encourage everyone to watch this, The Holocaust cost the lives of millions of ppl who we will never know what they could have contributed to the world. Anne Frank and her young life shows a glimpse of what could have been had she lived. The holocaust is something we should never forget happened, so heartbreaking!!!",1458604800,3,324,4.701754385964913
7276819,5,B00ZE501RS,"a poem after watching this wonderful documentary- i have seen many on the holocause- from ""Shoah"" to ""Hitler's Chilren""{- this is up there with the best.
to me- as you can tell by the poem- it could easily happen today- already is-

In Mem: Annaliese Frank (thanks to the National Geographic Special on Ann Frank and the Holocaust)

The archaeology of genocide
Proceeds at Sobibor

Slow sifting digging down shows that
Human teeth deteriorate less rapidly

The person in hijab escorted out
From a trump rally along with a seat mate with a yellow star.

The Dutch police, the Ferguson police,
Are present  Bergen Belsen, Westerbork.

On Morning Joe trump protestors are decried;
On hearing Stop hate speech, Mika and Joe express dismay.

Anneliese on the last train to the east
Where none return-she dies, next, the war ends.

Please connect these dots
To the right wing of today, please?

Human teeth deteriorate less rapidly,
Townspeople claim they did not see.",1453248000,2,962,4.919254658385094

7276823,5,B00ZE501RS,"Sometimes these focused stories end up being a little short of expectations, but this one is quite well done. Takes a very familiar story and fills in many fascinating details with excellent narration and commentary. In a sense this additional narrative becomes even more compelling than the better known aspects of this widely told tragedy.",1446681600,2,341,5.218181818181818
7276824,5,B00ZE501RS,"A truly fantastic documentary on a wonderful young girl, in that it showcases the ordeal and the aftermath. What is so great about this one is the mentioning of the surroundings and the details given of her capture and imprisonment, all told by friends of Anne. A very well researched and put together program to explore this pivotal, and horrible moment in history. Highly recommended. A great tool to use along with Anne's Diary.",1446681600,5,431,4.837837837837838
7276825,5,B00ZE501RS,"I enjoyed watching this documentary on TV.  I then purchased the DVD so I could revisit the subject from time to time.  It takes the viewer back to that place (occupied Holland) and time. The tragedy of the holocaust, particularly for this young girl, is well presented.  The question near the end, ""what has the world lost?"" is very thought provoking.  I recommend this video highly.",1446076800,5,384,4.7727272727272725

I feel the beauty of nature and the goodness of the people around me.

Every day I think what a fascinating and amusing adventure this is.

With all that, why should I feel despair?

The above is from a page (dated May 3, 1944) of Anne Franks diary and is found at the very end of this informative and absorbing documentary.

Most people know the story of Anne Frank (1929 to 1945) up until her and her familys arrest at the Annex on Aug. 4, 1944.  This film goes over this but then tells us what happened next as they are absorbed into their oppressors system of concentration camps during the Holocaust.

Through eyewitness testimony from camp survivors (including two of Anne Franks school friends) and stunning, blemish-free black & white film and still photos as well as brief comments from historians, researchers, professors, etc., the brutality and horror of exactly what happened to Anne Frank and her family is shockingly revealed.

Finally, some of the key questions answered in this film are as follows:

(1) What was the real first name of Anne Frank?
(2) Who arrested Anne Frank and her family at the Annex?
(3) A miracle occurred.  What was that?
(4) What was the name of the photographer responsible for taking the frightening photos that people remember when they recall the atrocity of the Holocaust?
(5) Why did the oppressors continue with their extermination plans even when they were losing the war (specifically the Second World War, 1939 to 1945)?
(6) Why was the final concentration camp that Anne Frank sent too so bad?
(7) What was the month in 1945 that Anne Frank died and why is that important?
(8) Who was The Beast of Belsen?
(9) There were two survivors from the Annex.  Who were they?
(10) What did the grandson of the photographer mentioned in (4) above do?

In conclusion, this is an extraordinary documentary that tells us what exactly happened to Anne Frank and her family after their arrest.  I leave you with three commandments that have emerged from the Holocaust as revealed in this film:

(1) Thou shalt not be a perpetrator
(2) Thou shalt not be a victim
(3) Thou shalt not be a BYSTANDER
