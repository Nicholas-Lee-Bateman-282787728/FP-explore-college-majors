7971319,5,B00006L91S,Had a good story. And Elizabeth Wagner is very attractive and could have done much more in this stripper movie.,1383955200,,111,4.6
7971320,3,B00006L91S,I ordered this DVD because it starred what I assumed to be a distant cousin since we shared the same very unusual last name. That said the movie was just  so so. I will share it with my brothers and sisters.,1377648000,,207,4.048780487804878

7971322,4,B00006L91S,"Aptly known as Friction on video, this movie was great introducing Elizabeth Wagner in nudity and in an errotic light porno.  It also displays Amir Aboulela of Barb Wire who did a great job playing Rick.  Although the movie did not get a big hit as drama, it did its purpose of nudity and life of strip club getting quick cash.  I liked it.  It would be a five star movie for me if it emphasizes more intense scenes of strip dancing.  Unlike other nudity movies, atleast the cover is real.",1345507200,,489,4.329670329670329

7971324,2,B00006L91S,"Okay, its your basic B-movie with some nudity, a story line that makes a tiny bit of sense to keep you in it but it's like okay... to a point",1322265600,,141,3.7333333333333334
