8540799,5,B009EYPTVI,"Outstanding! I highly recommed this for any student of the founding of the American Republic. These two men give powerful performances on the key philosophical differences between Jefferson and Hamilton in their own words.
Jefferson ""won"" the acclaim of future generations, but fortunately for all future citizens, Hamilton's economic vision for the country is what we continue to enjoy to this day.
Every high school history teacher should use this dvd, as well as the other dvds by Bill Chrystal portraying Alexander Hamilton, in their classes.
Well done.",1356134400,5,557,5.340909090909091
