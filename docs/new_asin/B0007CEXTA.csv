2208621,5,B0007CEXTA,"I had a slip disc of my back a year ago (in Jan'07). I hope none of you ever experience the pain and the frustration of being put on bed rest for extended period of time. I had to wear a belt for 6 months. Anyway, my body healed with physical therapy exercises (I spent a lot of $$ with a professional physical therapist). But I wanted a life long cure, and since I am from India and I know the miracles that yoga can provide, so I wanted to find a good yoga DVD for my back. So I enrolled into Netflix to check out the yoga dvds! And I tried many dvd's (including Rodney Yee) but I just fell in love with Marlon Braccia's DVD.

At first glance her DVD looks very amateurish, its not classy, it doesn't have a beautiful background etc, but the yoga postures are very effective. Also, she is not annoying (besides the long lecture she gives in beginning which can be easily forwarded).

I forget that I have slip disc when I do Marlon Braccia's yoga for a few days in a row. Best part is that she divides the DVD into 2 parts (relaxing back and strengthen back). The `relax back' section is approx 20 minutes and `strengthen back' section is approx 25 minutes (if you forward her talk). So on days I wake up late, I just do the 20 minute `relax back' section.

Last month I went back to my home country for a wedding and danced like everyone else and I have Marlon Braccia to thank for it. Just after doing yoga I have a feeling of well being which lasts me the entire day.
The DVD is wonderful, if you have back pain I would highly recommend it (of course check with your doctor first)

8046792,3,B0007CEXTA,"This video is led by Marlon Braccia. She is a yogi, so she does not have the enthusiastic demeanor of Erin Myers. She talks slowly and softly. Which makes this a very relaxing and therapeutic video, but it is not a workout. I could feel the stretch in my back and shoulders, but I did not feel a burn or get my heart rate up. Those aren't negatives, I just want to give everyone an idea of what this video provides. It would be great for bedtime because it is very slow paced, and I felt like taking a nap afterwards.

Marlon could have made this video better by preparing her timing a little bit better. She spends a lot of time talking in between poses, rather than while the audience is doing the poses, so the videos ended being a lot longer than necessary. There are three parts to this video: Relax Your Back, Strengthen Your Back, and Strong Back. Each of these parts is 25 minutes, so it is awkward timing. I think it is beneficial to do all three in a work out, but 75 minutes is too long, especially when the video is slow paced.

This video is meant for just back pain, not specifically scoliosis, so there is no opportunity for customization. She gives a couple variations to make a few of the poses easier or harder, but everyone will be getting about the same workout. I think this video would be good for someone who is currently experiencing pain. They could slowly do these stretches to work out the pain [although, I feel like I tweaked my shoulder a bit during this one, so I will need to ice it to see if the pain goes away].

I like that this video doesnt require any extra props (just a towel or yoga mat). And I do feel like it stretched out my back.

8046793,4,B0007CEXTA,So glad i got this. I had a car accident a few years ago and yoga has really been helping me. This one is great for me in the evenings.,1429142400,2,135,3.533333333333333

8046795,5,B0007CEXTA,"I'm starting out slowly, so I've only gone through the first section.  So far, I've been very pleased with the pace of the DVD and the instructions for the yoga poses.",1390780800,,167,4.387096774193548
8046796,4,B0007CEXTA,"I have a fair amount of experience with yoga so this dvd is a little elementary. I do, however, have quite a few back problems and when my back is acting up I often don't feel up to a studio class and this provides a perfect substitute. It is definitely not a high budget production, but this is not something that I find to be very important. All I care about is that when I am done with the three simple series, my back feels a lot better!",1269475200,4,441,4.0227272727272725
8046797,1,B0007CEXTA,My back felt great until I bought this tape.  Now I am seeing a chiropractor.,1268265600,,77,4.133333333333334
8046798,5,B0007CEXTA,"I agree with the other favorable reviews here.  This is the first yoga video I've owned, and I keep coming back to it for its simplicity and effectiveness.

Though not high in production value (filmed with a couple cameras in a small, simple studio), the presentation is simple, warm and inviting. Yogi Marlon provides kind, patient explanations and you can feel her warmth and caring through the screen.  I've watched other yoga videos filmed at exotic outdoor venues with fancy camera work and expensive budgets and I usually end up watching them without actually performing the exercises. This video, on the other hand, is quite different. It is so simply produced, so basic and well-explained, that you'll actually want to get down on the floor and start following along.  And you will definitely benefit from its pain-relieving effects almost instantly. Afterward, my back felt as though it was glowing with soothing, warm relief.

It starts with 6 modules on the Main DVD Screen:  ""Meet Yogi Marlon,"" ""Ideas on Practice,"" ""Ujjayi Pranayama,"" ""Relax the Back,"" ""Strengthen Your Back,"" and ""Strong Back.""  I find the ""Relax the Back"" module to be the simplest and most enjoyable and I usually perform that one when I don't have time for the full routine.",1244160000,14,1258,4.990430622009569
8046799,5,B0007CEXTA,"I have had bad problems for years and bought other Yoga videos that moved too quickly and made me feel inflexible and inadequate. I brought a copy of Yoga For A Healthy Back home and was thrilled! The Relax the Back section is incredible and made a big difference in how I feel. I got my oldest son doing it with me and he's a college football player who needed more flexiblity- he's 6'7"" and it made a difference in his season. Yogi Marlon is an excellent, patient teacher and whenever I complete one of her sessions, I tell my family ""I'm in Spinal Wellness!"" It's like a tranquilizer for the spine. Highly recommended for anyone with bad issues.",1206489600,17,648,4.453781512605042
