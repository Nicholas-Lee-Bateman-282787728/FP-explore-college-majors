3110895,5,B0013GRX5A,"Great movie . Both are classics that should never be remade . Everyone's going to love them both, need in your collection",1395273600,,121,4.545454545454546
3110896,4,B0013GRX5A,"ST. ELMO'S FIRE is a thoroughly repugnant film. Demi Moore's character gives new meaning to the word ""trash."" Her mouth spews four letter words in gravely filthy foul tones that make the viewer squirm in disgust. Judd Nelson's character is a pathetic cardboard caricature of rage personified that Nelson seems to typify in all his roles. Emilio Estevez tries in his role, yet it is another role suited for his screen persona. Good to see Martin Balsam even though this is a throwaway role for him. Ally Sheedy once more wastes her talents in this mindless teenage romp trying to make the audience identify with them with some form of empathy.  Andrew McCarthy character acts like an Andrew McCarthy clone. Rob Lowe's character and is the one saving grace of this film. Rob Lowe once again commands the screen with his distinctive presence as a man who has more going than meets the eye.  Rob Lowe is excellent in this film. Mare Winningham gives her usual performance and it fits her character. Even Andie MacDowell shinned in this film. Her presence is minor, yet very effective. Director Joel Schumacher simply demonstrates his niche for mediocrity with ST. ELMO'S FIRE. This film is truly a waste of time except for a few moments of radiance from some of its cast.
Onther other hand, Edward Zwick's direction saves ABOUT LAST NIGHT. Edward Zwick directed GLORY, LEGENDS OF THE FALL and THE LAST SAMURI among others and his craftsmanship is evident in ABOUT LAST NIGHT. The cinematography by Andrew Dintenfass is very good and truly sets up several key scenes. I really loved Elizabeth Perkins in this film. She draws you to her in almost all her scenes. This film is not a lightweight 80s romp like so many other films of that era and genre. And then there is James Belushi. He is an incredible actor. ABOUT LAST NIGHT is a film worth watching. ST. ELMO'S FIRE is another question.",1377561600,3,1884,4.740853658536586
3110897,4,B0013GRX5A,"I have liked this movie since it was released.
However, the bluray quality did not seem any better than that of a good DVD.",1289433600,,123,4.166666666666667
3110898,4,B0013GRX5A,"ABOUT LAST NIGHT addresses a question that was central to the 80s:  CAN a one-night-stand be transformed into an LTR?  Or does the early heat of passion unable to sustain itself over the long term when the couple encounters ""real~life"" problems?

A subplot to the question is this:  what happens when your friends don't care for the person you're dating (and vice versa)?  And, what if your friends don't like her friends / his friends?  Some major awkwardness can arise as each person jockeys for position in the pecking-order of your affections.

The movie was made back when it was a fad to have movies be 1/2 storyline & 1/2 rock video.  The film is set in Chicago and Robe Lowe & John Belushi play best buds who are trying to get by in a profession that they both abhor.  A young Demi Moore portrays the love interest for Lowe's character.

I was always perplexed that for yrs this movie was only available on DVD in a foreign / import format.  So, when I saw the release on BLU-RAY (for a good price) I felt compelled to pick it up.  Demi wasn't shy about disrobing in her early films, and I believe this one has more nudity in it than any of her other movies.  Oh, and I SO prefer Demi pre-boob job (although that's always a given w/me when it comes to any woman).

ST. ELMO'S FIRE is about a group of recent graduates of Georgetown university.  They are in a nascent phase of their life where they're between college life & the profession that they will choose to have for the rest of their lives.

The first time I saw the film, I didn't care for it much ~ mainly because I disliked the main character (Billy - played by Rob Lowe).  I've known too many Billy types in my life;  he was a smooth talker who was irresponsible, mis-treated women, couldn't hold a job & was pretty much out-of-control.  Nevertheless, Billy is the type of dude that you could have parachuted over Antartica & a day later he will magically find hot springs with a group of bikini-clad Antartic babes.  Ugh!

Watching the movie 25+ years later, I appreciated it more than I did while I was in HS.  It took me no time @ all to recall to mind why I had such a huge crush on Ally Sheedy (Leslie).  She is as adorable in the movie now as she was way back in the 80s!

None of the male characters in the film are particularly ""normal.""  Kirby (Emilio Estevez) and Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) are both obsessed with 1 woman that they idolize.  Their approach in the matter is quite different.  While Kevin lives as a virtual hermit who never dates, Kirby becomes a stalker of the woman he's infatuated with (Dale - portrayed by the gorgeous Andie MacDowell).  Fortunately for him, Dale is sympathetic to stalkers & doesn't toss him into jail!

The plot of the movie revolves around how all of the lives of the characters weave into & out of each other's lives.  None of the characters make a particularly seamless transition from college life to post-college life.  The soundtrack is one of the better Rock / David Foster soundtracks ever made, and MAN IN MOTION remains one of my all-time favorite songs.  So, if you're in the mood for 80s nostalgia, this disc belongs in your collection!",1286236800,7,3163,4.44695652173913
3110899,3,B0013GRX5A,"Just a quick comment about the DVDs.  Each movie is on a separate disc (not a flipper), but St. Elmo's Fire is presented in widescreen (2.35:1) while About Last Night is in full screen (1.33:1).  I picked it up in the bargain bin so I can't complain too much.  If you want A.L.N. in widescreen, you'll need to buy it separately.  The movies are pretty well known 80s fluff so I'm not rating the movies themselves (each to his/her own taste), but I did knock a couple stars off for one package with two different aspect ratios.  Most people prefer one or the other.",1265414400,14,564,4.384615384615385
