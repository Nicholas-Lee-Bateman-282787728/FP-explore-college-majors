5510045,5,B00AU15GLC,"Watching this video was like stepping back in time and actually attending the concert.  From the bits of sweat to the rainy weather, you could really see the detail and quality in this movie.  Makes me miss Freddie even more and wish he were still around",1387065600,,254,4.5
5510046,5,B00AU15GLC,both Friday and Saturday shows were great...wish there was more behind the scenes footage...if you thought Freddie was good in his younger years this one will blow your mind...,1378684800,,176,5.103448275862069
5510047,5,B00AU15GLC,Never saw Queen live and this will not make up for it but it is a great performance but a phenomenal band.,1376006400,,106,3.8636363636363638
5510048,5,B00AU15GLC,"Stunning. Simply stunning. The band was absolutely at the top of their game. The crowd was heaving. Freddie ruled that place. It is, and I've seen many concerts in many genres of music, the very best of the best. I'm a massive Van Halen fan, and I've seen them on tour live and their videos as well. The mighty VH loses to this DVD. Originally, only the Friday show was released because of better weather, and it just looked better, but the Saturday show was no slouch. There are inherent video quality issues, it is 25 years old, but the sound is superb.",1374192000,2,555,4.398058252427185
5510049,5,B00AU15GLC,"I have not bought the product yet, but was wondering what the difference is between the DVDs in this 2-DVD set and the 4-disc set with the 2 DVDs and 2 CDs. Is the second DVD the same?",1373760000,,184,3.8684210526315788
5510050,5,B00AU15GLC,This film shows Freddy & the gang at their very best. The film makes me miss him even more. I highly recommend this film.,1368144000,,121,4.083333333333333
5510051,5,B00AU15GLC,"This is a great  concert.  This review will not show that I bought this because I bought the 2 cd/2 dvd import last year, I could not wait for it to be released in the US.  I already had the original dvd but decided to get the new release for the new interview and the Friday night concert.  I wanted all of Friday night plus I wanted the cd's and the interview was a nice bonus.  (this  USA release does not have the cd's,  for anyone that wants them I believe the import is still available on Amazon).  Everyone will not want this,  but for those of us that do it is a nice release, and I really enjoyed the new interview. I do wish the editing had been a little less fast in switching camera angles, but  that does not make this a bad dvd.  The crowd energy in this concert really adds to the DVD .  The only thing that would be better would be a Blu-Ray release, (Hungarian Rhapsody in Blu-Ray is wonderful).  And now that it is being released in the USA the price tag is lower!  For anyone new to Queen I would reccomend this concert and the Queen Rock  Montreal plus Live Aid in Blu-Ray.  Then if you want more get Hungarian Rhapsody!",1365552000,18,1140,4.136986301369863

5510061,5,B00AU15GLC,"I didn't already own the original dvd of the Sat night only performance.  Now with the re-release of the Fri & Sat performances, my immediate reaction after watching both performances is that the Sat performance is maybe a little more professionally filmed with some interesting angles but that the Fri performance is more enjoyable.  Why? There is a more humor and banter from Freddie on Fri night and the performances are actually better (clearly at least vocally) because the Sat performance was the 2nd performance on consecutive nights and he was less rested performing on back to back nights.  I think Sat was less spontaneous because they knew this was the night they were being filmed for a commercial release, but still very good.  Fri was a lot looser and more fun.",1504742400,2,775,4.848484848484849

Well I give it 3 stars because this was shot during their ""It's a kind of magic"" tour so a lot of the songs they play are off that album. So if you're a HUGE fan of that album then maybe you'll enjoy this more. It was still great seeing Queen up to their old theatrics and Freddy Mercury was a natural born performer but I was just overall disappointed in the song selection.",1453852800,2,434,4.117647058823529

5510128,5,B00AU15GLC,"What can one say, probably one of best all-round Groups of all-time they had it all, for me, great Instrumentally, vocals, led by
the ultimate showman 'Freddie Mercury' who's vocal ability was legendary, lead guitar of course 'Brian May' bass guitar 'John
Deacon' and on drums the equally talented 'Roger Taylor' THIS WAS 'QUEEN'
I doubt if you'll find too many Pop/Rock fans that don't have high regard for the group, i myself followed their music right from
groups first Hit 'Seven Seas Of Rhye' back in 1974, of course when they released the Rock-Opera number 'Bohemian Rhapsody'
their fan-base exploded, the group had most certainly arrived.
I myself bough the groups singles and albums on vinyl as and when released, later covering my collection on the CD format, could
say the group are among my all-time favourites.
This 2-DVD Set was recorded during the groups 'MAGIC' tour of 1986 at Wembley where they performed in front of 144,000 adoring
fans.

Owned this since it's release having been given it as a gift (would have bought it myself of course) deciding to re-visit and review it on this day.
Great Collectable.

And how well that years later, we can still enjoy his work. This concert was played at the stadium at Wembley in 1986, and has become a classic.

5510162,5,B00AU15GLC,"Freddie Mercury is my pick for the number one vocalist of all time (in the realm of the rock/pop fields at least), and this DVD shows why his loose, beer-fueled, crowd-pumping performances were among the most watchable rock/pop spectacles ever given. The sound on this disc is fantastic, and the visual presentation is equally as good. If you are into rock and you have previously been prejudiced against this music group, it's time to let the sound fill your ears and clean out the poor and undernourished vocals of other lesser singers that you may have been feeding upon. This is an absolutely incredible performance.
If you have been in search of a heavy but still pop-driven rock show, ""Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium"" might just be the ultimate musical orgasm that you have been waiting for.",1393545600,13,797,4.824817518248175
5510163,5,B00AU15GLC,"There are two, count them only two bands that I love in this world, and that I know put on a KICK BUTT stage show and Queen is one of them. This is the concert of all concerts for any Queen fan. I am not usually one to spend money on anything like this but this is a MUST HAVE!!!!! Freddy Mercury puts on one of the best shows of his life. He never stops singing. This guy had a  voice from another world and it will never be forgotten regardless of his life choices. There will never be another like him, and this concert is one that i feel sums up his life and musical career respectively.

*****  A MUST HAVE  ******",1392768000,,619,4.008130081300813

  I could go in depth song by song, but the proof in the pudding to me is that they sounds exactly like the albums, and they manage (IMO) to make a song you didn't think much of sounds bad-ass!",1387411200,20,394,4.157894736842105
