7861250,3,6304088124,"Two first-season episodes are featured on this Monkees tape, including the one that really got the ball rolling on the show.
Monkee See, Monkee Die was the second episode aired, and it is the one that really got the show's momentum going, combining a briskly-moving narrative with the country-rock hit that got the group on the charts - Last Train To Clarksville, with its Paperback Writer-influenced guitar riff and melody wrapped in a nicely country twang - and its excellent ""twin"" from the debut long player, Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day, using the basic rhythm in a tougher texture.
Amid the inheritence and murder theme of the story, the standout gags come at the end, when Davy slips a Micky or two to three ""disappeared"" relatives of his latest love, Ellie Reynolds.  They don't appear to work, until Peter pulls a ""gun"" that proves surprisingly effective.  But the real kicker comes when Davy scoffs at rumors of ghosts, and a Dickens of a ghost enters - which scares the boys and Ellie into a SFX-shot running fit, one of the few such SFX shots to feature someone else along with the boys.
Less effective is the late-season Chinese spy tale, Monkee Chow Mein, featuring a guest appearence by M*A*S*H alum Mike Farrell.",1028246400,,1231,4.80188679245283

The laughs never stop, Davy falls for a girl and she falls for him.  You see the trade mark ""stars in the eyes"".  Well can ya blame the girl?  The second show is funny too.  Peter gets involved with an international spy ring by taking ""fortune cookies home to the dog they don't have"" Mikey and Peter get kidnapped and Davy and Mike think it's a job for""Monkee Men"" and the guys save the world from the ""Doomsday Bug"".",981244800,6,543,4.173076923076923
