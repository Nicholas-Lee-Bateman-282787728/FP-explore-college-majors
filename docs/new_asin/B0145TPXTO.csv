7383714,5,B0145TPXTO,"I really enjoyed this movie and think the actresses did a great job! The chemistry between them was very organic which I think made the film better. It does have a very sad ending, but to me, the love shared between these two women leading up to the end of the movie makes it palatable. Just like in life, there are sad endings, but it is how you live until those moments which truly matter most. I think that this film did a good job capturing that.  My only complaint is that they could have left some parts out that I don't think were necessary for the film, and instead could have shown more development of the two main characters. This could have just shown better the love between the two. That being said, I still think its a 4.5/5 stars.",1450396800,,745,4.283687943262412
7383715,3,B0145TPXTO,As another reviewer stated its a sad love/comedy story that has a tragic cancerous ending. I liked the movie and Patricia Velasquez is an awesome actress but I could have did without the Dr. Kevorkian ending.,1450310400,2,208,4.805555555555555
7383716,4,B0145TPXTO,"Overall, this movie is worth watching.  The acting is good, and the scenery is gorgeous.  The lead characters are believable, but not fully developed, which made it difficult for me to identify with the movie on an emotional level, other than being INCREDIBLY sad.  I would have appreciated a little more F/F action, given that most of the characters were lesbian.  Overall, I agree with the earlier reviewer - worth watching, but wouldn't watch it again.  And can we PLEASE have some lesbian love stories where all the characters survive?!",1450310400,16,540,4.955555555555556

**** In Venezuelan Spanish with English Subtitles ****

Eva (Eloisa Maturen) is a straight married woman who's recently lost her young son.  Her marriage is on shaky ground and all her losses and grieving seem to propel her to the land of Lesbos for some sexual healing.  Her car breaks down and she finds herself with nowhere else to stay except Margot's seaside hotel, which is currently filled with a group of lesbian friends on vacation.  She doesn't make a great first impression as a bratty straight girl busting in on this lesbian haven...

Despite barely managing her worsening illness, Liz reverts to her womanizing ways and makes straight girl's presence more appealing when she bets her buds she'll bed her within three days.  A sweet friendship ensues and these two offer sensual comfort through the best and worst of times.

I wish I could completely rave about this film. It speaks of the healing powers women share with each other.  The two leads are beautiful and actually have decent chemistry-- Patricia Velasquez (Liz, the brunette) is even an out lesbian in real life, which is very awesome. The acting is pretty good, and who doesn't find the Spanish language sexy??  The beach retreat setting was gorgeous.  The plot may sound very melodramatic... and yet it didn't bleed with angst or depress me.  The ending was bittersweet and yet hopeful.  But I just wasn't terribly moved by this drama on any level.  I mean, I liked it and enjoyed the eye candy and it's better than some of our other movies, but it didn't delve too deeply into anything.  So I didn't find myself particularly excited or sad about anything.  And I think it coulda been a beautiful love story without all the terminal illness.  You've got a tropical setting, a colony of pretty lesbians and a juicy straight girl for the taking... and you wanna dump a DOUBLE DOSE of cancer all over that?!  WHY?!

Because seriously.  Must our stories always end this way?! There are COUNTLESS happy-ending lesbian stories being published these days... why are filmmakers so determined to pick/write the sad ones?!  This one is actually based on a 1980 play by Jane Chambers called ""Last Summer at Bluefish Cove.""  Yes, 1980.  I don't care if it's considered a ""classic""... I'm so over the miserable classics and this line of thinking that we aren't allowed to be happy!!  I wish filmmakers were looking toward the future instead of dwelling on the past to tell our stories. More fun and positivity and lesbians who aren't synonymous with tragedy, please...

Besides cancer, and more cancer... there is some primal roadside het sex I could have done without.  There is one F/F sex scene as well. Some nudity.  Motherhood is a valued experience here but no children dominate the scenes.  All the lesbian friends had their own issues and dreams and lives... but none of that was developed much.

Patricia Velasquez has a fashion model history and you may recognize her as Anck-Su-Namun from the Mummy franchise and Begoa from S5 of The L Word.  She's a hot, womanizing tomboy dyke here who rides a motorcycle... very nice to look at.  But so is the straight girl, Eva. :)

Despite my complaints, this is still a sweet story and worth watching.  But I wouldn't watch it again or buy it.",1449187200,29,3269,4.761565836298932

7383738,4,B0145TPXTO,"Really, a 4.5 - the only detractions are for occasional poor filming - e.g., when Liz & Eva are in the boat heading to dive, the camera boat circles in front of it, clearly showing the path of the camera boat and causing swells and a distraction.  I also give Elosa Maturn (Eva) a 3.75 on her acting - beautiful actress with great potential, but either because of limited acting experience, or limited direction or both, her performance doesn't match the rest of the actresses, especially Patricia Velsquez.  Still, a superb movie and much more than a lesbian flick.  The end of life issues vis a vis mercy killing, complicated relationships, love, loyalty, and the whole gamut of human emotions and issues make for a remarkably meaningful movie.",1464739200,3,746,4.8125

7383748,5,B0145TPXTO,"Forget for a minute its a story about a two women falling in love, first and foremost, its a love story!!

 Eva is a straight married woman, who just lost her son to cancer and is in a very shaky marriage.  On her way to a resort where her husband is supposed to meet up with her in a day or so, her car breakdowns and she ends up staying at a lesbian resort filled with a group of friends on holiday. One of these is Liz, who unknown to Eva is dying of cancer. Liz is torn with regret and guilt about past actions and relationships and is afraid once she dies no one will remember her, life will go on as it always did, just without her.

Eva and Liz start as hunter and prey, Liz makes a bet that within three days she can bed Eva. As time goes on though Liz falls in love and Eva also feels the same about Liz. Liz's humanity breaks through and she has someone there for her at the end, someone who will remember her and mourn for her. In fact, Eva makes a major commitment intuit she is the one to administer an overdoes to Liz at the end in order to spare her pain and the indignity of a slow death.

Its a love story, people meet, fall in love, deal with past demons, deal with redemption, happiness, pain, sickness, and death. Whether its a same sex or opposite sex couple, the things we all go through are the same, with little variations. I read one review where the reviewer was upset because there was no ""T&A"" in the movie. Its not porn, its a great story, shot in a beautiful place, and identifiable no matter your sexuality.",1459987200,3,1538,4.113333333333333
