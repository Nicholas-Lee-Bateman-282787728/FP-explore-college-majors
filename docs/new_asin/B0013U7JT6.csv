8253082,5,B0013U7JT6,"I felt compelled to purchase this DVD as I have been increasing my spiritual practice again.  The DVD is exactly what I desired as it delivers a perfect blend of spiritual practice and physical for myself.  I love the combination of the breathing exercise, meditation and sun salutations to increase the flow within the spine.  You really don't need anything more if you understand that Naader is an instrument of yourself delivering a holistic approach to mind body soul recovery.  I Have Naader's previous DVD set and this DVD is excellent.  Thank you again!",1314403200,,560,4.914893617021277
8253083,4,B0013U7JT6,"First of all, let me say that this DVD is NOT perfect.  The menu is simple and the production is not very polished.  Furthermore, the actual yoga routine itself is rather short (30 minutes), but a longer routine is not always better or doable on a daily basis.  The other aspect which I found rather annoying is the audio.  The instructor's voice does not carry over the music, so it has to be listened to on the 'voice only' option with the menu...and even then, the instructions could be more complete.

All this being said, I still recommend this DVD because there are some appealing elements in it.  I particularly like the beginning Pranayama exercise...I have never done such a physical pranayama routine.  The instructor puts more emphasis than most on the breath.  I also appreciate the pacing...this DVD gives you a few moments to actually HOLD and FEEL a posture.  There are a LOT of sun salutations, so don't expect to learn a lot of new poses, this is mostly a chance to perfect the more traditional ones.

As far as the narrative is concerned, well, it IS entitled Yoga for Mystics.  So many of these DVDs stress the physical benefits of the practice and the spiritual elements get brushed aside.  I sense that the teacher is quite sincere with his invocations to a Higher source and he is able to transmit that to the other practitioners.

Namaste!",1313020800,2,1362,4.648535564853557
8253084,3,B0013U7JT6,This video assumes you are in great shape physically and structurally.  I am recovering from lower back pain and it does not work for me but I hope to be well enough to do it soon.  I recommend this one only if you are not experience any back pain.  :),1301875200,,252,4.0
