2542201,4,B000EWBNPK,"One of my all time favorite lines comes from this cartoon show. Rhonda (playing Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz) reads from the Book of Truth: Volume 7 in order to melt the witches credit cards. Yes, credit cards- get her where it really hurts!

""Plaque can cause gum disease!""

""Oh no! My credit cards! They're melting! Melting! Ahhhh!""

Okay, so the animation is a little dated. Still, it's definitely worth a $10 preorder. If you're looking for something cute, funny, and harmless for when you have to babysit your nieces and nephews like I do, this is something they won't have heard of.",1144886400,8,589,4.644230769230769

2542203,5,B000EWBNPK,"my niece came to stay with me a couple months ago and I didn't really have an kid movies, but I had season one of alf she loved it. So after she left I bought a couple different alf items on amazon this was one of them, she loves the dvd",1374710400,,237,3.6666666666666665

2542205,3,B000EWBNPK,"Alf tales was just as good as the TV series in my opinion, however I was looking for the 'mainstream' animated series rather than the segment  ( classic fairytales ) included in the in the mainstream animated
weekly show that was presented on Saturday mornings. Any ideas about where I can obtain that Saturday
morning show?  Rock.",1304035200,2,331,4.7894736842105265
2542206,5,B000EWBNPK,"I really enjoyed this video.
Even if your not a fan of Alf, the cartoon series sets itself apart with creative writing, flawless animation, fun stories.  The Alf Tails series is especially fun to watch.  There are some extremely entertaining characterizations as well including Ronald Regan and Johnny Carson.  Some of the dialog is very reminiscent of the classic comedy of the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy.  Most of the jokes are based on the popular culture up to that time; something parents will find funny, but the kids will still enjoy this.",1280102400,,553,4.851063829787234
2542207,5,B000EWBNPK,"Alf is always funny and weird.  I loved this show and also the original television series.  These are Alf's twisted versions of popular fairy tales.  There isn't much resemblamce to the original stories.  Don't buy this if you are expecting anything close to the Disney versions.  You have to like strange, satyrical stuff to be into this DVD.  I loved it though.",1271721600,,363,4.774193548387097
2542208,4,B000EWBNPK,"It was a great show. The DVD is fine except I was hoping there might be additional features. However for the price I paid, $4+ , I can't complain. Hopefully they come out with more episodes",1268611200,,189,4.277777777777778
2542209,4,B000EWBNPK,"Alf Tales were the peak of this alien's career.  The show was never that good, and the animated series while better than what was allowed on prime time wasn't as good as their crack at the fairy tales and current events.  Granted, these are animated by DIC, so the art is okay at best, but the writing is witful and acerbic, and even downright raunchy at times.  These aren't perfect, but the floods of memories make them even better.  For those who remember the 80s - they will be fantastic.",1229385600,,492,4.433333333333334
2542210,5,B000EWBNPK,"I just thought the Alf cartoon series was the best!  This is pretty good, but I guess my favorite fractured fairy tales didn't necessarily ""star"" Alf.  But I just love it.  The puns are the greatest.

It's NOT as great as Mr. Peabody and Boy, but it's BETTER than the Alf human series, in my opinion.",1222732800,,300,4.303571428571429
2542211,4,B000EWBNPK,"Alf Tales was a strange creation in my book. The Alf cartoon series was funny, but Alf doing fairy tales? In the end I have to say it worked... for the most part. The saving graces for the series were the witty stabs at pop culture and the occasional clever lines you hear. The animation is dated and rather weak even back in the 80's, with some of the slowest animation frame rates you can get from that era. Put it all together and you still have a funny series. According to my sources the episodes on this disk are as follows:

1) Robin Hood

2) Sleeping Beauty

3) Cinderella

4) Legend of Sleepy Hollow

5) Jack and the Beanstalk

6) Aladdin Brothers

7) Rapunzel

There are some good ones in this collection, especially Cinderella, who is visited by a Fairy Godfather who grants her three wishes she cannot refuse. Robin Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk have some fun jokes too. Don't expect any extras on this DVD. It's just not in the price point. However getting seven 22-minute episodes on one collection is a major plus, as opposed to the standard four episode collections these companies are still doing (as if they are stuck in VHS tape mode).

If you remember the show and remember getting some entertainment out of it there is no reason not to get this collection considering the price. If you only know Alf from the TV series and commercials this DVD is a different slant in Alf's world, but the irreverence is still there. If you never heard of Alf, but like strange slants in fairy tales this DVD is still worth a look.",1145318400,18,1537,4.4412811387900355
