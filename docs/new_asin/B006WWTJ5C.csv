5026222,1,B006WWTJ5C,"If I could give this waste of time less than one star, I would.  I still have no idea what it was about. After 20 minutes of watching ocean waves and three guys wandering through an empty house asking if anyone was home, I turned it off. During that 20 minutes each fool is struck by some fake looking electric bolt and then each one is shown wearing only his shorts and tied up and bound to some object.  They writhe in fake agony while the camera jumps in and out over each one's body for a ridiculous amount of time.  After more ocean waves, another shirtless dude is walking on the beach with another guy who he summarily kills by braining him with a tree trunk. What little dialog there is is inaudible.  Don't waste your time on this bomb.",1465084800,2,745,4.26241134751773

5026225,2,B006WWTJ5C,"Like all the 1313 films, there's a lot of shots of the eye candy wandering around the same house only to never appear again.  The actual plot (thin as it is) has some amusing elements but let's be frank, you're not watching this for the story.  Enjoy the eye candy!",1463356800,,265,4.28

5026227,1,B006WWTJ5C,The video was not what I had expected and was more of a low budget repetitive theme of corny body shots no good plot.,1447718400,,117,3.9166666666666665
5026228,1,B006WWTJ5C,"Idk who this so-called director is, but he is either mentally challenged or has absolutely no common knowledge of what people enjoy when it comes to movies. And he is certainly gay.

I can understand that he would maybe want to throw in a guy with his shirt off in a scene, but man does he over do it!!!!
And when i say he over does it, i mean every scene in the film is of a young guy with his shirt off!!! I couldn't believe it. Did this guy actually think people would enjoy these movies??? I have a hard time believing someone, somewhere actually found them good enough to be put on dvd. We have enough bad movies on dvd these days, theres absolutely no room for garbage like this.",1414368000,,685,4.1893939393939394
5026229,2,B006WWTJ5C,They are the worst collection of movies. They all appear to be the same. Wolfe Videos really fell down here.,1404950400,,108,4.45
5026230,1,B006WWTJ5C,"Seriously, does the ""director"" have a huge trust fund? ""Gee, I think I'll round up a few barely 20 year old studs and put them into an inexplicable, barely-there plot line that results in them being periodically knocked out, tied up, and stripped to their tighty-whiteys."" Yikes. Whoever is behind this series of art films - spend the money on therapy. Lots and lots of therapy.",1338076800,13,378,4.742424242424242

8505877,1,B006WWTJ5C,This movie should not  have been filmed. It was so bad I could not even tell you what was all about. All they have are some guys with muscles.,1474675200,2,142,3.896551724137931

8505879,3,B006WWTJ5C,"Most inventive of series. Leaves things unclear and unresolved. Having said so, still has some cheesy qualities typical of the scripts. Light fluff not to be taken too seriously.",1469145600,,178,5.172413793103448
