5064133,4,B0079C8N8S,"Legendary filmmaker Roger Corman would be proud of SAND SHARKS, a giddy, preposterous, cheesy B movie that's perfect for the addicted B-movie enthusiast.  The writers obviously kept their tongues firmly in cheek, and viewers must set their expectations accordingly.  Remember the short-lived ""Parker Lewis"" series?  Corin Nemec who played the title role,  gnaws the scenery as the real estate wannabe mogul who returns to his home turf to promote a Sand Festival to ""save"" the island's floundering tourist trade,.  Stock characters include the busty marine biologist, the steel-jawed sheriff and his sister deputy; the mayor who happens to be Nemec's daddy; the sexy shark, oops, lawyer, the requisite shark hunter and others on the hungry sharks menu.
Special fx are appropriately humorous and there's plenty of gore.
SAND SHARKS is simply mindless but enjoyable for fans of the genre.",1345939200,9,886,5.345323741007194
5064134,4,B0079C8N8S,"When coming onto a film called Sand Sharks, it's pretty obvious that you're either going to love it, or hate it, depending on how you view B-movies. Being a fan of cheesy creature features, I didn't expect anything but to love this film, and I did.

The film opens with two 20-somethings riding dirt bikes in a desert-looking place who soon find themselves falling victim to, well, a sand shark. One of the victims decapitated heads is discovered by what appears to be the only two cops on the small island of White Sand, John Stone (Eric Scott Woods), and his daughter Brenda (Vanessa Evigan). The two ultimately decide it was indeed a shark attack, but because of how far the decapitated head was from the shore makes them question how. Fast forward about 20 minutes later, and the two decide to call in Dr. Sandy Powers (Brooke Hogan), a scientist who specifies in sharks.

Because of the lack of tourists on White Sand island, the town's mayor's son, Jimmy (Corin Nemec), who happens to be Brenda's ex-love interest, decides to throw a beach party in hopes that it would revitalize the island.

A few shark attacks later, John, Brenda, and Sandy try to prevent the party in fear of more shark attacks, but Jimmy of course ignores their warning, which of course leads to the death of many bad-acting partying college students.

Throw in some decent low-budget effects, lame CGI sharks, ridiculous dialogue, and some B-list actors, and what you get is this beautiful gem, otherwise known as Sand Sharks.

I was actually surprised at how good the movie was, to be honest. Watching this film, I didn't expect much more than another campy B-movie flick, but this movie seemed to deliver a little bit more than most SyFy-esque films.

The characters were very B-movie. You've got the cop with a troubled past, the daughter who isn't over her ex, her heartless ex, and the scientist who is just as clueless as everyone else. To my surprise, these actors weren't too bad for the most part. Yeah, they all had their moments, but how else could you react to a CGI sand shark attacking you?

The effects weren't the best I've ever seen, but they definitely weren't the worst, especially for a B-movie, but, how realistic can you get with a low-budget, anyway? The shark was probably the most unrealistic thing about the effects, which is to be expected anyway, and the bright red blood, of course.

Overall, you're going to either love this film or you're going to hate it, that all depends on your tolerance for these types of movies. If you're looking to have a good time with a few friends, then this is your movie, but, if you're looking for something serious, you're better off checking out something else.",1340409600,23,2704,4.689873417721519

You expect the acting to be flaky, but if someone just gets eaten by a shark it's kinda hard to just move on....the funniest part for me was during the beach party scene when the shark appeared. People were running back and forth across the beach TOWARDS the sharks!!! LOL.

To begin with I didn't expect it to measure up to ""Jaws"" and you shouldn't either.

If you don't mind watching a cheap B-grade thriller with some pretty bad CGI effects and over the top plots. Then this movie shouldn't disappoint.

Corin Nemec (Stargate Sg1) plays Jimmy Green, a slimy businessman who returns to his home, on an island, to propose to the mayor, who happens to be his father, that they can put their island on the map by setting up a weeks event for college kids, something like Cancun/Burning Man etc.. However, there is a problem. It seems the island has a shark problem. Only these sharks are not your average shark. They swim in sand! After killing one shark, they think the island is safe, so 1000's of kids flock to the island, only the party is only just beginning... for the rest of the sand sharks!

Expect to see some lame acting here and there, especially by the guy who thinks he is Popeye The Sailor Man, some pretty bad visual effects and an expected lame ending. However, it's not bad enough to turn off, so you can make it to the end, but I doubt you will think the film is a keeper, but check it out once if it interests you.

5064262,3,B0079C8N8S,"This ludicrous straight-to-video low-budget comedy horror movie is a bit like a 2012 remake of the 1990 Kevin Bacon film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors-DVD-1990/dp/B0000A5BTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors [DVD] [1990</a>]"" with a previously unknown species of large shark taking the role of the underground monsters.

It ought not to work at all: the plot is even more preposterous than ""Tremors"" was, the script does not have nearly as many genuinely memorable lines of funny dialogue, most of the acting is terrible, and the specal effects are worse in the 2012 film than the makers of ""Tremors"" managed twenty-two years earlier.

However, because the film does not take itself at all seriously and delivers non-stop black humour and action, I found to my surprise that I quite enjoyed watching it once.

I suspect that for most people it would only be a film to watch in company with some friends or your significant other on a night in when you've had something to drink and are in a mood to find something ridiculous to laugh at.

It is set on the quiet island of White Sands, which looks quite like Catalina Island in California, as that it where this was filmed. The island's tourist industry and therefore much of the local economy has been gradually going to hell in a handbasket since an attack in the sea from a more normal type of shark a few years ago scared a lot of the tourists away.

Corin Nemec plays Jimmy Green, son of the local mayor (played by Edgar Allan Poe the IVth) who returns with an idea to rejuvenate the island's economy by organising a huge party, the ""Sandman Festival"" to attract college students at Spring Break. Unfortunately they arrive on the island just in time to become potential food sources for a huge and previously unknown species of shark which can swim in sand. Vanessa Evigan plays Brenda Stone, the island's deputy sherriff who is also Jimmy's ex.

Brooke Hogan plays Dr Sandy Powers, a marine biologist and daughter of the marine biologist who investigated the previous attack by more normal sharks a few years before. Sandy Powers arrives on the island in response to a call from Brenda Stone who is the first person to suspect that some kind of shark may be involved in the first few ""mysterious"" deaths at the start of the film. Brenda was actually trying to get hold of Sandy's father, also called Dr Powers, but he has retired so we get Sandy instead - a plot detail which was presumably originally written into the script with the intention of setting up some mistaken identity jokes, but if so they never happen. Which is typical of how amateurish this film is.

Watch this with low expectations, especially if you enjoyed ""Tremors"" a few years ago and are in the mood to see something similar, and you may be pleasantly surprised. Watch it expecting anything remotely up to the calibre of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-2-Disc-Special-Edition-DVD/dp/B0009UV4H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (2 Disc Special Edition) [DVD</a>]"" and you'll probably be disappointed.",1355616000,3,3121,5.1561264822134385

5064264,5,B0079C8N8S,"The title alone promises that this is a crazy/cartoony idea, and thank goodness, it's a comedy.  Filled with puns and referential jokes and a particularly loopy performance by Corin Nemec; I was chuckling throughout.  This is definitely a shark movie that I'm putting in my collection.  What a nutty concept, it's funny and people die in droves!
Of course, this movie would be nothing without Corin Nemec's bizarre performance as a ne'er-do-well prodigal son who keeps bouncing into scenes like a manic nincompoop.  His character is pompous, sleazy, pathetic, and a hoot.  He manages the impossible by taking a villainous role and making it strangely endearing.  His life saving technique alone was sadly hilarious.  Then too, there were his off the mark impressions of his dad.  He was a marvel to watch.
I applaud the people involved who took a tired retread and made it fresh.  Yes, it's an obvious rip-off of the Jaws formula.  They even have their version of the crusty old shark expert (who has to be heard to be believed!).  But so what, Jaws wasn't funny, this is; therein lies the difference.  Whether you like this movie or not depends entirely on your sense of humor.  If you like things slightly off kilter, you'll love it.  But.  If you can't accept this type of humor, you will wonder what's the point.  You might even find it a tad dumb.  (There are those, however, who highly esteem this type of movie for just those reasons, it's dopey and it's fun.)

This is obviously a B-movie that doesn't take itself very seriously. If you enjoy schlock horror films, this is actually one of the better ones out at the moment. Although Brooke Hogan may get top billing, Corin Nemec pretty much steals the show in this one. He's actually a pretty good actor, with an IMDB credit list a mile long. The movie mainly centers upon his comedic attempt to throw a beach party, despite people being (sometimes half) eaten all around him. His comedic timing is excellent, which kind of clashes with Brooke Hogan's bumbling acting job, but it all adds to the charm of what turned out to be an entertaining little bit of schlock cinema. If you're expecting a schlock horror film that is low on gore, has some witty writing, features laughable special effects and is good for a few laughs, you won't be disappointed.",1347148800,3,1026,4.6740331491712706
