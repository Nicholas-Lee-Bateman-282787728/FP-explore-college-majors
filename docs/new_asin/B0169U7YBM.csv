7466042,5,B0169U7YBM,"Monster Girls have been popular for years, so you can watch them in TV, reading them in manga books or see them in the Internet. I have read the manga and I loved it. Monster girls, they are real and they want to date us, what does the government do? They set up the Interspecies Exchange Bill and it had extremely strict laws, so human males and monster girls cannot touch or date each other no matter how many times those sexy and attractive monsters came on to their male crushes. Kurusu Kimihito, a 20 something year old learnt that he was selected to be an involuntary to six sexy monster girls who will be living with him. Those monster girls are: Miia, a sweet, friendly, but sex crazed, possessive, and jealous lamia. Papi, a clueless and birdbrained harpy. Centorea or Cerea, a busty, shy, and noble centaur. Suu, a simple slime girl with the mind of a child. Mero, a gentle, polite, and lovesick gothic Lolita mermaid. Finally! Rachnera, a sadistic and seductive Arachne. Sadly, this anime ran for only 12 episodes and I wish they make a new season. This is not an official anime, but an bootleg. I give this cute, sweet, sexy and funny anime a five star rating.",1467417600,,1172,4.507042253521127

7466048,3,B0169U7YBM,"I admit this show great, hilarious, and beautifully written and drawn. However this is a bootlegged version, the official japanese release isn't done releasing this, also they would never sell all 12 episodes so cheaply",1448496000,14,219,5.285714285714286

8736058,5,B0169U7YBM,"This anime has fulfilled all of my expectations, as I had already read the manga. Fans of this type of anime (ecchi/harem/comedy) should not be disappointed.",1477440000,,157,5.076923076923077

8736061,1,B0169U7YBM,"I'm actually somewhat surprised that Amazon is selling such trash.  This is a Malaysian bootleg copy using capped episodes from the Japanese network airing the series.  Twelve episodes on one DVD should inform anyone with two brain cells to rub together that this is a very poor quality bootleg with high video compression in order to squeeze this many episodes onto one disc.  The second clue is the languages that are used for the subtitles and the third and final clue is that the DVD is region free.  This is definitely just a slickly packaged bootleg and not worth the money, if you buy it you will be disappointed don't say you haven't been warned.  The anime has been officially licensed in the United States by Sentai Filmworks and the manga has been licensed by Seven Seas.",1471651200,5,782,4.678832116788321
8736062,5,B0169U7YBM,I was very happy to see this arrive. I have read the books and was pleased to see that the TV shows follow the story lines. I can't wait for more to come out.,1469404800,,158,3.676470588235294
