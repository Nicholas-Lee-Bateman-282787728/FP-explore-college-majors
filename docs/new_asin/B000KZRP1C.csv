And it will make you feel really good after you`ve done it. This is a workout for all of us who loves to dance/workout, but need to find the time to do it.",1397260800,,316,3.4027777777777777
8159890,1,B000KZRP1C,"I don't really care for this workout DVD.  The style of dance is very different and not something that I'm used to.  It's not the typical dance where it breaks down the steps for you and, you follow along and then put it all together at the end.  It was more unstructured and you were following her weird dance movements and wasn't even a good workout, you won't break a sweat.  I also didn't find the music and costume appealing.  In fact, I found the costume so awe full that it distracted from the workout.  So far I have done only one workout and probably won't again, I don't recommend it.",1198540800,,594,4.306306306306307
8159891,4,B000KZRP1C,"I bought this dvd based on the previous review.  I have to say at the start that if you are not a dancer, are not coordinated or rhythmically challenged, do not buy this dvd.  You will be lost, lost, lost.  As the previous reviewer said, this dvd is made for people who have been dancing for awhile and want to stay in dancing shape. That said here are some more specifics.

Setting: Blue screen background in a sound stage with image reflected behind the dancer.  Production is a little on the cheap side to me.

Dancer: Just the teacher in voice over as there a music only option. She is a mature woman of a certain age, however in great dancers shape.

Music: Latin jazz with cuban percussion underneath the instrumentation. Here's the rub.  If you can't fluidly follow musical accents and need a strong beat to dance to, you will be lost.  Some of the movement is very fluid other movement is percussive.

Choreography: In 4 sections.  You can go the dance world ny web site to see a video clip.  I won't go into a whole lot of detail on this.  I will say that it is fast and assumes that you have a good dance vocabulary. Non dancers will be lost.  Also the stretch and release section can be harmful to your knees, beware! The segments weren't put together with continuity.  Some segments just end with her still dancing and the next segment appears.  Therefore you may have to put the dvd on pause so you can get into position.  The dvd could have used much better editing on this.  I was expecting it to flow like a class.  It doesn't it is 4 separate segments.  The bonus abs section is abs belly dance movements.  Having never taken belly dance classes before, I may have to pass on that segment.

Overall:  Well this dvd will take a little bit getting used to.  I think you can get the most out of it once you learn the routines and you can do it with the music only option.  Again I recommend it only for dancers or dancers at heart.",1177459200,12,1945,4.321329639889196
8159892,5,B000KZRP1C,"My ex jazz instructor would kill for this dvd. If your dancing is just fun stuff now and then, this probably isn't for you. But if you plan on staying with dancing for a while, this is wonderful conditioning and exercise program. It'll keep you supple, give you posture and alignment for those beautiful poses, and will keep you safe while you dance.

Back when I was learning jazz, I looked around for a video like this one. Something that would keep you working on core movements on the days that there no classes. But I didn't find one then.

Perfect in 10 has 4 workouts. You could do them together if you've built up to exercising good and solid everyday (or so) or you could do any of the segments to lead into whatever dancing you're doing. You could also pull it into any other workout if it fits well.

The description of this video is quite extensive and available on the producer's (World Dance New York) site so I won't repeat any of that in my review. I also own Ayshe's Core Fitness for Bellydancers and find that on both these programs she is deeply knowledgeable and authoritative. You take one look at her - and trust everything she has to say.

The description, video clip and pictures will show you what you'd be in for. You can see that some of the segments involve a lot of activity and pace while others are based on stretches and stances. Yoga, modern dance, jazz, belly dance, ballet and other dances have been drawn on for movements. The program would be good preparation for any dance.

The basis for the movements - and being safe - is all explained in a lecture or ""workshop"" on this video. I'd recommend going through that carefully, even though there's no dancing going on just then. You get a full lesson in dance anatomy and body awareness with graphics kicking in to help.

I think this, and other videos from this producer, to be such solid value for money that I very little reason to drop below 5 stars. For less than $10 you get four great workouts and a wealth of advice from a beautiful and graceful dancer and completely knows what she's talking about.

Oh--an important point or two. There's a music-only mode so you can do the workout along with Ayshe when you've finished learning it. And it is doable for men as well.",1175558400,8,2261,4.460048426150121
