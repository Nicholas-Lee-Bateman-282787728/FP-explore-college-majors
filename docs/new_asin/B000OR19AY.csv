8186381,4,B000OR19AY,"I kept hearing about Margot Anand, but when I recieved the video I wasn't really sure what to expect -- how could it not come off as awkward? I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it by myself, or with my partner. But once I started watching, I understood that Anand makes sexuality normal -- as it should be -- not as something strange to discover. All the practices are easy to learn and not particularly esoteric, but just deepen one's awareness of being in the moment and ability to experience joy and pleasure. Highly recommended for straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, single, coupled, married, etc.",1345939200,6,597,4.695238095238095
8186382,4,B000OR19AY,This is a comprehensive SkyDancing Tantra workshop in a box. I have had Margot's book The Art of Sexual Ecstasy for years and this DVD set really helped support me in doing the practices she explains in her book. I enjoyed seeing how the practices were done and it made it easier for me to get my beloved to do them with me. Margot Anand has created an easy way to learn and practice the secret keys to ecstasy. The Chakra Mandala meditation alone is worth the price of the set with its amazing graphics and beautiful music. I like how you can watch the DVD through or you can just watch the steps of a specific practice before doing it. I found this such a great tool I bought several more and gave them as gifts. This set is well worth the price and I continue to use it regularly.,1195948800,23,783,4.19205298013245
