2254201,5,B0007Z9QWG,"Im excited about this DVD

even when i don't know whats on it

Now all they need to do is bring out the different anniversary

years (aka: the 80's one with Donna Summer & The Pointer Sisters with young Drew Barrymore as host) and they'll be set.",1112313600,4,246,4.191489361702128
2254222,5,B0007Z9QWG,"While you wait, go to Extinct-attractions-club.com, they have the BEST Disney attraction DVDs ever made.  I'm sure this DVD will be great, but those with an appetite for Disney's history, interviews with imagineers and old footage of classic attractions, will love the EAC noted above.  Disney... hurry with this DVD!  :)",1139875200,13,321,5.254901960784314
2254223,1,B0007Z9QWG,"Is this for real?  They are taking orders for an item, that will not be available until 2010! Does anyone have the story on this?",1138233600,7,129,4.16
2254224,5,B0007Z9QWG,"Not to be rude....but some people need to learn that when it comes out it comes out....don't push the issue. It looks like a great DVD but people are starting to ruin it. And, by the way, I agree with the intelligent people who say that 2010 is just a FILLER!!!!! From a source I have it will be available in a couple of months...Nobody will die from not buying a movie.",1136073600,5,370,4.152777777777778
2254225,5,B0007Z9QWG,Some of you who are freaking out over Amazon's date that is set for 2010 are idiots. That is just a filler date because they had to put something up because no date has been finalized. From what I have heard this is going to be one of the best Disney DVD's ever. I pre-ordered this DVD back in June and I still can't wait. So some of you need to stop crying and wait patiently.,1134000000,11,377,3.973684210526316
2254226,1,B0007Z9QWG,"Is this some kind of joke???? How can it possibly take 5 years to release a DVD that is allegedly already ready for release!!! We clearly all want it now so could you just hurry up and release it . If you seriously aren't going to release it til then, then you shouldn't have even bothered putting it on the site for another few years because it just teases us. I am not happy, please let us have this DVD!!!!!!!!",1134000000,3,413,4.175
2254227,3,B0007Z9QWG,"I have heard that there have been problems with the complexity of the material in the DVD.  In other words, Disney originally slotted the title as a children's release but have found that the title more appealed to adults with an interest in Disneyland's history.  In the original version, the stories and secrets, from what I've been led to understand, came across as marketing and trivia already covered in many other places.  Again, it's my understanding that presently the title is under revision with the adult collector in mind.  Hopefully the revisions will produce a coherent program and the title won't be scrapped.  I would assume that the new DVD, marketed at adults and collectors, would have different cover art as well.",1133827200,11,733,4.975409836065574
2254228,5,B0007Z9QWG,"2010?! Are you kidding me?! Please say it's not so! Say that we don't have another 5 years to wait for this title to be released. I have been waiting so long for this to come out. Myself and so many others of course. It stands to be pretty great from the buzz about it, so I recommend it whenever it comes out... which better be soon and not 2010 if Disney is smart. Let's hope it's not true being that it's all seemingly in 50th packaging. Fingers crossed!",1132531200,2,457,4.146067415730337
2254229,4,B0007Z9QWG,"On a recent trip to Disneyland, I purchased a DVD with the 50th anniversay artwork on the front, thinking it was history of the park.  Boy was I wrong.  Do not buy the park DVD, instead wait for this one.  The one currently selling at the park is nothing more than the travel video Diseny sends out as a promotional for the park.  The DVD advertised as COMING SOON here is more along the lines of what I thought I was getting.  Let's hope this DVD actually makes a debut sometime soon.  How much longer can they hold out?",1130284800,19,521,4.212121212121212
2254230,5,B0007Z9QWG,"I believe this DVD will be released sometime in December of 2005.  Do not want to get anyones hopes up, but I have a good source who feels this will be the time.  I have seen brief cuts and this is probably the best Disneyland DVD yet!!!  Look for the release in December 2005, January 2006 at the latest.

If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but won't you be glad if I'm right!!!!!  Former Disney Cast Member - Animation/Art of Disney",1128988800,14,424,4.25
2254250,5,B0007Z9QWG,I actually went to Disneyland on the 50th anniversary hoping the dvd would be released on that date (July 17th). It was not there and I was very disappointed. I am hoping they release it soon because it sounds like it is one of the best Disney movies so far. I can't wait to see it.,1123113600,5,282,4.053571428571429
2254251,5,B0007Z9QWG,When I ordered this dvd 2 months ago it was $13.99.  Then it went up to $14.99 and now it is $15.99.  Wow!  My 5 star rating is because I've got 5 stars worth of anticipation built up.,1122854400,8,184,3.789473684210526
2254252,5,B0007Z9QWG,"The July release date apparently came and went. Amazon says they have not been informed of a new release date, so they use January 1, 2010 as a placeholder.  Hopefully Disney just had some production delays and will provide an updated release date soon. Rated it a 5 because I expect to love it when it finally comes out.",1122681600,15,321,4.440677966101695
2254253,5,B0007Z9QWG,"Some friends of mine got to see a sneak preview of this DVD and they said it was one of the best things they've ever seen about Walt Disney and Disneyland.  They said it had heart.  They said they laughed and cried and laughed some more. That it was obviously not a collection of Disney commercials.  It made them want to go to back to Disneyland all over again, but look at it with different eyes.  It sounds like its done to me.  So, Disney, why can't WE see it?  I was planning to buy a ton of them for Christmas gifts for all my friends and family !!",1121904000,27,554,4.036697247706422
2254254,1,B0007Z9QWG,"I too was waiting, impatiently, for the date IN JULY 2005, that this was to be released, now I see it's been updated to January 2010?!?!  What the hell is going on??!?!  The DVD format, as it is now, probably won't even be around then.  I want this DVD NOW!!!!!!  My one star review has nothing to do with the DVD (I haven't seen it yet, (THANKS, DISNEY!), it's more a reflection of my irritation at the delay of its release.",1121817600,4,425,4.209876543209877
2254255,5,B0007Z9QWG,"I assumed this video would come out with the other three disney dvds that debuted on July 12, 05. Instead, I was shocked to see it is available in 2010! Does any one else find this disturbing? I was so excited to get it, and I'm only giving it 5 stars becuase of that, and now I am a bit disappointed. 5 years from now! That is forever!",1121558400,3,336,3.9558823529411766
2254256,5,B0007Z9QWG,I bought this dvd for my 6 year old son.  I cant wait for him to see it.  He has had other disneyland dvd's and plays them over and over.  I got a vacation planning dvd from disneyland and he watched it so much he knows it word for word.  I cant wait for it to be released.,1120608000,,273,3.6551724137931036
2254257,5,B0007Z9QWG,"This DVD includes incredible video and soundbites from the people whose hearts went into creating the park that Walt so loved.  It is wonderful to hear the workers tell their stories, explain some of the magic at Disneyland, and share their experiences.  You won't find Hollywood fluff in this DVD, but the heart and soul of Disneyland!  If you are a Disneyland fanatic, you will love this DVD.  If you love Disneyland history, you will cling to every word.  If you have no idea of what Disneyland is truly about, you will when you have finished watching.  This video will make you laugh, then cry, then smile again!",1118620800,27,616,4.657407407407407
2254258,5,B0007Z9QWG,"I love to see this kind of thing, my other favorite place for Disneyland History is the Extinct Attractions Club. I cant wait

to see the final dvd. I have heard its going to be super comprehensive.",1116547200,4,198,4.351351351351352
2254259,5,B0007Z9QWG,"WOW, I'm so excited for this DVD to come out! I can't wait!

.:UPDATE:.

So did anyone else get and update from amazon this past December 2005? I did, and it said that the DVD would be shipping in early January. Apparently, the DVD has not been released yet. Is amazon teasing us too?

And people, stop being mean to the people that have greatly anticipated this DVD and have no idea that the release date of 2010 is only a ""filler"". Gees, where's your Disney Spirit.",1115596800,3,467,4.344827586206897
8054551,5,B0007Z9QWG,"Well pall, its the 11th & I don't see the ""ad to cart"" button. I'll just bet, if they keep prolonging this DVD we might be able to buy it in a set with Disneyland's 100th.",1197331200,,171,3.7777777777777777
8054552,5,B0007Z9QWG,This long-awaited documentary about Disneyland is now the main feature of the newest addition to the Disney Treasures series !! Yay!! Better get it while you can at the pre-release price !!,1196812800,,189,4.9375
8054553,5,B0007Z9QWG,"Walt Disney Treasures - Disneyland - Secrets, Stories & Magic, will be the new name.  It will be released on December 11th 2007. I am excited, this was suppose to be released in 2005 as part of the 50th year celebration.  Should be an awesome DVD.",1196035200,,247,4.3478260869565215
8054554,5,B0007Z9QWG,Everyone can relax. This title will be released on December 11 along with The Chronological Donald Duck Volume III and Oswald The Lucky Rabbit.,1175299200,11,143,5.0
8054555,5,B0007Z9QWG,"There has been some news, actually from Disney themselves, of this title since the last review. Apparently it will be released in 2007 as part of the new Walt Disney Legacy. Check out [...]",1166486400,6,189,4.588235294117647
8054556,3,B0007Z9QWG,I've waited for this to be released for a couple of years now. WHERE IS IT????? WHY HASN'T IT BEEN RELEASED AFTER ALL THE ADVERTISING?,1165449600,,134,4.4
8054557,5,B0007Z9QWG,Why do cover art when the product is never going to be released?  Any word from anyone?,1163376000,,87,4.117647058823529
8054558,5,B0007Z9QWG,"This title may yet see the light of day. According to UltimateDisney.com, a web site dedicated to covering the world of Disney DVDs, sources close to this project say it has been shifted to an autumn 2006 release.  Here's what UltimateDisney.com had to say:

""Sources within and close to Disney have told us that Secrets, Stories and Magic of the Happiest Place on Earth has been tentatively re-slated to arrive on DVD this fall. Originally planned for release on July 12, 2005, the disc was delayed at the 11th hour for no clear reason. ...This much-anticipated DVD will contain a number of things, all related to the world's premiere theme park, Disneyland. The main program is Disneyland: Then, Now and Forever, a brand new, never-before-seen, feature-length documentary on the Anaheim resort. Supplements, as originally announced, are to include the ""Wonderful World of Disneyland"" trivia game (with beginner and advanced levels), interviews with Diane Disney Miller and former Imagineer Rolly Crump, rare footage of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse on stage at Radio City Music Hall in 1962, the 12 sing along songs from Disneyland Fun, and, inside the case, a collectible replica of the original Disneyland E-ticket book. Those contents are subject to change, as is the expected autumn timeframe. ...If the planned release date holds up, we should be getting a new announcement in anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.""

So this is terrific news for those of you, like me, who have been impatiently awaiting its release. Personally, I'm psyched by the news, even if it is only rumor at this point. Hang in there, and don't give up hope of owning this before the end of the year.",1146096000,30,1685,4.926056338028169
8054559,1,B0007Z9QWG,"So I preordered this DVD months and months ago, and from what i've been reading it is not going to be released at all? Is this true? How can I get my money back? Somebody with all the details please give them to us.",1143331200,2,215,3.909090909090909
8054560,2,B0007Z9QWG,"Remember when this was to be sent July 2005 just prior to the 50th Anniversary? That date came and went. Then in September/October sources both here and elsewhere on the internet claimed December 2005, January at the latest. Then we get claims from January that it will be a couple of months at the latest. Tired of the rumors, I called Buena Vista Home Entertainment (the official source of the DVDs) and this item is no longer listed on their release calendar, although the CM indicated that they remembered it recently with a TBD release date.

We can only guess why this has occured, and anything else is speculation. 2 stars, Disney's trouble with this disk is making hard-core fans unhappy. Right now you are better off with the Extinct Attractions Club.",1141689600,15,760,4.757575757575758
