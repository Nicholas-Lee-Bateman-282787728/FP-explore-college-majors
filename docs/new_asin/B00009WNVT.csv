7993752,1,B00009WNVT,"Golden Gate, 1994 film

It begins with a view of the bridge that connects San Francisco to Oakland California. Men wear hats in 1952. Kevin Walker goes to his FBI office and meets his partner. Couples dance in a bar. They are fighting Communists to preserve styles of womans clothing. Kevin meets Cindy, they dance, then find a room. [Believable behavior then?] They talk about Communism. The office manager talks about the Chinese, whose country was taken over by Communists. There was a strike that caused prices to rise. They investigate the practice of sending money abroad; the judge dismisses these cases. This is illegal, trading with the enemy [the war in Korea].

Cynthia complains to Kevin. Ten years pass, its 1962. One of the Chinese men was released but has problems. Kevin cant save him! Kevin meets this mans daughter, they become friendly. It is now the mid 1960's, culture in San Francisco and elsewhere is changing. One college professor informs the FBI about students who have different ideas. It shows scenes of life for some people. There are few movies that are concerned about life for Americans of Asian descent. At the end Kevin goes to the Golden Gate bridge and the movie ends.

Was this meant at a parody or satire? It is not a story that held my interest. While there may be a good story about the history of Chinese Americans, this is not it. Nor about others, like Europeans from the Continent. Your opinion may vary. If you want history read a book.",1526515200,,1481,4.710424710424711
