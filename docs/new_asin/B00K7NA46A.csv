6404565,4,B00K7NA46A,this continues to be one of the all-time great TV shows.  However  I don't understand why they have omitted certain episodes from these discs. I realize this is not Amazon's fault still it is upsetting.  the episodes are still great the show is still great and I would highly recommend watching.,1434067200,3,295,4.745098039215686

6404569,1,B00K7NA46A,It is my own fault as I did not check the episodes on this set out because a short time before Amazon.com offered a extra Season 2 with the missing episodes that are not on the In The Heat of the Night Season 2 & 3. I had ordered them but cancelled my order because of illness. And so presuming they were the same that I had ordered earlier I order them and now I have copies of episodes on In the Heat of the Night Season 2 & 3. Are those other discs with the missing episodes that are not on In the Heat of the Night Season 2 & 3 still available because I would order them.,1406419200,,575,3.8403361344537816

8656658,3,B00K7NA46A,"Disc 2 was cracked but I may have done that when removing it.  Also, I was very disappointed when the last show on Disc 4 was TO BE CONTINUED so I didn't get to see the end.",1489449600,,173,3.675675675675676
8656659,1,B00K7NA46A,"I have purchased the first 6 seasons of In the Heat of the Night and I LOVE the series...but the quality of the DVD's in The Best of Season 2 (and Season 3 for that matter) are so poor.  I have tried MULTIPLE sets of Season 2 and 3 and still do not have a set where all the DVD's function properly....EVERY set has multiple pixilation issues,  freeze issues,  etc.  It is interesting that I had no problems in Season 1, 4, 5, 6. I really feel that Amazon should not sell these defective sets until the company that produces them (TGG Direct) can provide sets for Season 2 and 3 where all the discs work properly.  Amazon should pull the Best of Season 2 and Best of Season 3 from their marketplace.",1488844800,,698,4.2180451127819545
