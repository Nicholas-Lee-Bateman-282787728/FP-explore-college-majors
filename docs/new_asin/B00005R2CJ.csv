1652844,5,B00005R2CJ,"I bought this for a coworker, her baby loves curious george, now while he watches she can sleep, then her husband sleeps, we work third shift, so it worked",1215475200,,155,4.379310344827586
1652845,2,B00005R2CJ,"This is not what I thought it was, I thought it was a cartoon as illustrated on cover but it was not,my granddaughter seems to like it, she has watched it a couple of times, however, I did not like it.",1209945600,,201,3.926829268292683
1652846,1,B00005R2CJ,My three year old refuses to watch this video because The Man in the Yellow Hat SMOKES! And so does George!!!!,1182816000,,110,4.285714285714286
1652847,2,B00005R2CJ,"If you are looking for a Curious George DVD from the cartoon animated PBS series, this is not the DVD for you.  I believe the cover is misleading in this regard because it is actually a stop motion animation feature made in 1982.  There are two Frog and Toad features, also stop motion, which are Frog and Toad Together and Frog and Toad Are Friends.  These two appear to have been made in 1987 and 1985, respectively.  It appears this DVD was packaged in 2004 by Sterling Entertainment, so the 2005 date listed by Amazon is based on the release date and does not reflect production dates.",1180828800,5,589,4.4766355140186915
1652848,3,B00005R2CJ,"This is a nice, classically animated DVD.  However, I was disappointed that the majority of the DVDs running time is devoted to the ""Frog and Toad"" stories, with only one Curious George story included.  This video should really be called ""Frog and Toad stories, with a bonus Curious George episode"".",1174867200,8,299,4.96
1652849,5,B00005R2CJ,"This is absolutely one of the most delightful children's videos I have ever watched.  While the Curious George tale is great, the Toad and Frog stories are even better. The animation is superb as is the presentation.  But the best thing about it is that how it is entertaining while being something of a morality play.  It teaches children and all of us the immeasurable value of friends and helps us see that our occasional thoughtlessness can cause us to inadvertenly hurt those who love us most.",1121990400,24,498,4.7011494252873565
1652850,4,B00005R2CJ,"The story follows closely to the book, and is very nicely done! Creative claymation.",1120694400,9,84,5.071428571428571
1652851,5,B00005R2CJ,"Both the classic Curious george books and the original Babar story are complete politically incorrect, but generations of kids have loved them anyway. Maybe Bruno Betelheim's theories about why kids connect with violent fairy tales are true. Anyway, George is abducted from the forest, but that's the way the original book went, and our kids have always been okay with it. The claymation-style animation is wonderful, too.",1065657600,4,422,5.313432835820896
1652852,1,B00005R2CJ,"After a smash hit with Curious George goes to the Hospital, we decided to get this for my 3.5 year old.  We were shocked! George is abducted by the man with the yellow hat (is actually shown shackled in a bag), nearly drowns while falling off the ship catching seaguls (is shown gasping for air underwater), then is confronted by very angry firefighters after experimentally making a phone call that results in a false alarm. The final shocker is George being thrown in jail and desparately trying to get out which finally results in his crying.  This was little too much for our 3.5 year old.
Buyer beware!!!!!",1016496000,8,611,4.648148148148148

7951668,5,B00005R2CJ,i would choose this provider in the future. thank you for rapid response to my order.. it met my expectations,1374624000,,109,4.5
7951669,2,B00005R2CJ,This DVD wouldn't work after just several playings.  Old and used. It was a waste of money and my time.,1364083200,,103,4.15
7951670,2,B00005R2CJ,"The kids are bored to death with this video. It has a lot of stills where someone is reading and if you have hyper kids, this is not your kind of purchase!",1242432000,,155,3.875
7951671,1,B00005R2CJ,"After receiving this DVD and Curious George Goes To The Hospital, I have come to the conclusion that both these DVD's are nothing more than a rip off. Without being able to see the rear cover of the case, a person cannot know what they are purchasing. I don't know how anyone could rate these DVD's above 1 star, much less some of the 5? star ratings that have been given. These DVD's are HORRIBLE! Especially when you are expecting the DVD's to be similar to the Curious George that is on PBS. And there is absolutely NOTHING in the movie description to make you believe otherwise. If I had been smart enough to read the reviews before I made the purchase, I wouldn't have to be writing this review. The people that gave these DVD's the 1 star knew exactly what they were talking about. In the future, I will be looking before leaping and I advise all of you about to make a purchase of these DVD's to do the same. Steer clear of these ""movies"", as they are nothing more than JUNK.",1241136000,,982,4.313513513513514
7951672,1,B00005R2CJ,"This video is deliberately deceptive.  It's stop-motion animation, not cartoon animation.  Even the title ""Curious George Comes to America"" is a fabrication.  This film was based on the original book written by the Reys in 1939.  This book was simply named ""Curious George"". (It was the book Tom Hank's son carried around in Forest Gump.  It was also the first book I ever checked out of the library in 1958.)

When I created the Curious George and Frog And Toad films in the early 80's, both authors, Margaret Rey and Arnold Lobel were still alive.  Every effort was made to be true to their books - there was genuine respect for their work.  The resulting films won many awards and were best sellers in their market.  How does it come about that these films, considered classics by some, are now being used as fodder for the exploitation market?  Is this part of the anything-for-money attitude that has dragged our country down?  One thing is clear: SVE has no respect for authors or filmmakers living or dead.  Shame on SVE!

7951673,3,B00005R2CJ,"I loved this old style Curious George!  Very reminiscent of when I was young!  But the kids watched it once or twice and didn't ever ask for it again.  When I said I was taking it to the resale shop, they just answered ""ok""... so I guess they didn't think it was as neat as I did  :-)",1234051200,,284,3.8448275862068964
