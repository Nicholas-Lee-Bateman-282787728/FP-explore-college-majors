Not only did I find this tape entertaining, but it showed a lot of things in slow motion which made it easier to see what you should be doing.  I liked the fact that there was some science behind it (i.e. how high you should toss the ball, why pronation helps the serve, etc.) to better explain why you should try what is being shown.  The different camera angles were great & really broke down every different aspect of the service motion.  Highly recommend this one!  Too bad it doesn't come on DVD.",1172966400,,580,4.383177570093458
