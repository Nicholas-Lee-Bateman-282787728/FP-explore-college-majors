Michael's masters, and teachers shine through his exquisite execution, expanding wisdom, and sincere humility.  The Four Attitudes collection is a living treasure delightfully stunning my conservative mid-western senses experiencing receivers with chronic complaints and/or serious stress issues melting on the mat softly sighing in exquisite ecstasy.
Yoga Therapists this is a must.",1239235200,2,538,6.472222222222222
8338914,5,B001RUI8QK,"I have taken a few of Michael Buck's classes on Thai Massage, and the last one I took (The 4 Attitudes - Thai Yoga Massage - Nuad Borarn) which is a 7 DVD Home-Study course was just so inspirational and uplifting and aspiring me to new heights in my massage career.  This man is truly gifted in his calling, and definitely deserves even more worldly recognition.  No wonder he has attained the renowned ""Hall-of-Fame"" position in his field.

I highly recommend this DVD series, as well as his other DVDs to anyone who is serious about learning about and offering this amazing Thai Massage art.",1237248000,2,593,4.628571428571429

8338916,5,B001RUI8QK,"This is a very thorough, very understandable, well-filmed and well-illustrated instructional tool for an indispensable healing modality which is all too little known in Western culture.  The benefits are over-the-top and far-reaching.  The Instructor is a True Teacher.",1236211200,,269,6.052631578947368
8338917,5,B001RUI8QK,"Michael Buck has been so generous with his gift for teaching yet AGAIN.  I have had the set for about 3 months and it has been such a wonderful tool for my practice.  If you have been fortunate enough to experience his teaching first hand, then this is the next best thing.  If not, get ready for the experience of a lifetime!  This set gives you the opportunity to experience Mukti's thorough teachings along with great visuals, which serve to enhance your understanding and appreciate the beauty of this healing art.  A must for all Thai body workers, massage therapists, yoga teachers and anyone interested expanding their personal or professional practice. Wonderful for ALL levels of experience.  Enjoy!",1236211200,,708,4.9576271186440675
8338918,5,B001RUI8QK,"This is totally luxurious but it's not a luxury item--it's a necessity.  When I'm not blessed with Mukti's divine presence, I can learn and grow from this ancient body art through his dvd collection.  Who else does this? Outstanding! He's serious about spreading the word, and such a drive is contagious. May only good things come to you.  (May this package come to your doorstep!) Infinite Peace and Love!",1236211200,,406,4.855072463768116
8338919,5,B001RUI8QK,"Mukti,
I had a chance to check out some of the new DVD series this weekend......simply awesome!! I was blown away by not only the technical mastery, but the way you are able to communicate the intuitive aspects of the practice that can so easily be lost in when presented in an instructional format. This is the most thorough exploration of this artform that I have found. This work is too important not to get it out to as many people as possible! Outstanding!! Jai!",1236211200,,467,4.5058823529411764
8338920,5,B001RUI8QK,Michael Buck has yet again given us a fabulous set of tools to have in order to continue to share this beautiful art of thai yoga massage. The disc set is his best yet!,1236211200,,168,3.9705882352941178
8338921,5,B001RUI8QK,"A big thanks to Mukti for creating this DVD set! Now I have hours of sequencing that I can review on my own time! When you see how much information is on these DVDs, you'll realize what a great value this set is! You won't be disappointed :)",1236211200,,241,4.041666666666667
8338922,5,B001RUI8QK,"Wow, there is so much amazing information in this 8-DVD set that I think it will take me years to master it all.  Michael Buck has really done Yogis and Bodyworkers a huge favor by publishing such an immense amount of bodywork technique and theory in a study-at-home set.  The Vedic Conservatory is doing wonders to spread Thai-Yoga Bodywork throughout the world. AMAZING!",1236211200,,372,4.888888888888889
