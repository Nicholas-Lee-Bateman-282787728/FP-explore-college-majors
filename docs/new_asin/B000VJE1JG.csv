8219028,5,B000VJE1JG,This is the full TV broadcast (without the commercials).  So if you want to see a race as it was originally broadcast and not edited features...this is what you want.  There are some sporting events you want to keep and that are worth watching again.  This is the best way to accomplish that.,1425859200,,292,4.471698113207547
8219029,5,B000VJE1JG,"This is one of the best finishes ever, and Ned Jarrets call of the Dale and Dale show. was excellent.",1288569600,,101,4.1
8219030,5,B000VJE1JG,"The 1993 Daytona 500 is one of the most thrilling and dramatic races of the last 20 years. The DVD presentation may ""look"" lame, but the picture quality is absolutely fine, given that the race was taken off of digital tape and anything wrong with it is from the original source and not the authoring. The only main problem is that the coverage starts about a lap from the green flag, but you get all 500 miles in a package that is more than acceptable. If you can get it from the Team Marketing website or from the Marketplace, your purchase will be rewarded with one of the greatest duels in Daytona 500 history!",1244246400,,613,4.385964912280702
8219031,1,B000VJE1JG,NASCAR FANS SAVE YOUR MONEY!  This as well as others i've bought from nascar super store are almost un-watchable.  It's almost like some kid with a 8mm camera filmed these races.  These are not what was televised.  Had any TV station aired these NASCAR would never be where it is today.  The cars are white and black most of the time they are on screen.  They are just silhouettes from the sun glare.  I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised.  Even some of the newer races look this bad.  How could NASCAR get the money to grow as they did if fans couldn't see the fancy color schemes or even the number on the cars.  And the sound is also equally as bad.  I can't suggest strongly enough how much of a waste these tapes are.,1239753600,,777,4.2534246575342465
