5943506,5,B00EU8RBXW,"I love this movie, and Wes Brown. I've watched this movie whenever it played on television and still haven't gotten enough of it. This is a feel-good movie that the whole family can enjoy, which is rare these days.  I'm a big western fan and am soooo happy that Shadow on the Mesa is finally being released on DVD. I've already placed my order and am now anxiously awaiting release of the book (hint, hint) :-)
A big 'thank you' to Lee Martin and David Cass, as well as the cast and crew of this excellent movie. I'm sure there are others, like myself, that would LOVE to see a sequel, or Part 2, etc., whatever the name, just more, more, more. Thanks again.",1385683200,28,658,4.306451612903226

5943519,5,B00EU8RBXW,"Wes Brown made this movie worth watching and he isn't even listed in the credits. Also the guy that played Baldy, and the foreman of the ranch were likable characters. The younger son was ok. But the wife and the daughter, ugh! Of course Sorbo, Baxter, and the guy that played her husband acted their parts out well.",1483747200,,316,4.4655172413793105
5943520,5,B00EU8RBXW,"Great movie! It's descent, no bad language, and Wes Brown who plays the Bounty Hunter does a really good job in this role. However, one oddity is that the front cover of the movie shows Kevin Sorbo decked out in his hat, jacket, bandanna, and toting his guns like he is the main ""go after the bad guys"" dude, but during the whole movie he is limping around on a bad leg, and only gets into the fighting at the end of the movie. It's the Bounty hunter that does most of the squaring up with the bad guys, and does a very good job of it. Kevin Sorbo does play a good role, but just with a crunch under his arm.",1481587200,,608,3.9918032786885247

5943543,5,B00EU8RBXW,"This was my first Kevin Sorbo western so I wasn't sure what to expect. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It is about a bounty hunter named Wes Rawlins who comes home after a job to find that his mother has been murdered. He also learns that his father (Kevin Sorbo) who he believed was killed in an ambush a few months before his birth, was still alive and that his mother tried to contact him just before she was killed. So setting out to locate his father and to find out if he had anything to do with his mothers death (and kill him if he did), Rawlins discovers that his father is in the middle of a land dispute with another rancher and stays to learn more about the family he never knew he had.
This movie is well written, directed, and casted and all of the actors give wonderful performances. The director (Kristoffer Tabori) does an excellent job at balancing both the pacing and sound throughout the entire movie. The music, action, and speaking parts are kept at a constant level and there is a good balance between the character development and action scenes. I did not have to adjust the volume a single time during this movie to turn down the music and gun fights or to turn it up to hear what they are saying, which is unheard of in todays movies.
The pace of this movie is slow but the story and performances are engaging enough to keep you interested. There is a lot of killing and gunplay in this movie yet somehow it is still relatively family friendly. If you like BBC style movies and watch them for the characters and story line then you will enjoy this movie. However, if you prefer Hollywood Blockbusters and enjoy lots of action and special effects then this may not be for you.",1443312000,2,1714,4.3730407523510975
5943544,1,B00EU8RBXW,Very disappointing movie.  Got it because Kevin Sorbo starred.  Very slow and boring,1442534400,,84,5.384615384615385

No cussing, and the violence is ""old-school,"" with no gore or excessive bloodiness, like you'd find in a John Wayne western from the '40s and '50s.

5943571,3,B00EU8RBXW,"Considering this was a made for TV type of movie, it clearly stays within the boundaries of straight forward mediocre Western.  Consider: Just about every cowboy's hat looked as though they had just bought it the morning of the shooting.  The clothes were fresh out of wardrobe's departmental closet and all the shoes/boots were squeaky clean.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Westerns.  What I don't like see mediocre Westerns in which this film lies directly dead center of.

The points this movie receives is mostly based on merit.  The story, while oh-so-predictable once we see the initial he-she encounter is actually somewhat decently acted.  The ""stars"", consisting of Meredith Baxter (less Birney, who doesn't even have this movie attributed to her on her IMDB listing), Kevin ""Hercules"" Sorbo, and Diedre Lovejoy (who played ""Ronnie"", the lawyer on The Wire), were the last used actors of the lot.

This is a feel good movie.  Boy meets long lost dad who never knew his son existed thinking the boy's mother was killed in an Indian attack and boy comes to call him 'pa' kind of movie.  It's an okay movie.  If you're looking for something with depth, excitement and want to feel the hairs in the back of your neck rise, go elsewhere.",1415145600,2,1238,4.7924528301886795

5943620,1,B00EU8RBXW,This movie plays music throughout the entire thing I think.  I only made it 20 minutes. It was too hard to hear the dialogue through the background noise. Too bad. I think this could be a really good flick.,1394150400,6,206,4.282051282051282
5943621,4,B00EU8RBXW,"I've liked most of Sorbo's flicks.  I never cared for him and his Hercules series...not my style..  But his family oriented western movies are really something to be proud of.  There is good measures of realism.  There is constraint on how much blood is needed to make a scene authentic.  The acting is a good 85 to 95 on a 100 scale.  And there is no reason to shield any of the family from what shows on the screen.  Sorbo's movies are praise-worthy in that gore and sex are NOT the main points of interest.  This movie shows wholesomeness, justice, family values for that period and a great world view that reflects honor.

Sorbo was doing a lot of sitting around in this flick.. something wrong with his leg. I kinda hated to see that... but the young stud they used as the action hero figure did a very good, if not quietly subdued job.  He, wisely, didn't have a lot of lines...but his stare into the bad guys could drill holes into granite!  He might be a bit similar to Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns in a very younger time, sans cigar.
A man of few words, a hard stare and a dead-aim.

I am continually amazed at how good and exciting and entertaining a movie can be when you don't have to ""stimulated"" by T&A, all the F-words that most folks don't use and know that there are consequences to bad actions.

This is an enjoyable, relaxed, movie with a realistic, and good world-view.",1394150400,15,1396,4.427450980392157

I have always been a fan of Kevin Sorbo, but in this movie Wes Brown was the best. A great story with intensity and action.

5943664,4,B00EU8RBXW,"I bought the DVD for the box which featured Kevin Sorbo and Meredeth Baxter. I found myself enjoying the story of his character's son and the people he is there to inadvertently help. This is a traditional western in the vein of land rights and crooked con men trying to steal the homestead. Pleasingly, this is one the entire family can enjoy. Those who consider this sort of story 'cheesy' are better off watching the latest $300 million dollar CGI blockbuster.

I knock a point off for the deceptive box, Kevin Sorbo is acceptable as the patriarch of the family, but the star billing of he and Meredith Baxter (in a five minute walk-on at the start) was badly handled. Whomever was the media marketing genius for the cover should be fired and find another line of work. They were just as shifty as the villainous crime boss! Buy it for the young cast members and their big break, and ignore the misleading advertising.",1389139200,7,921,4.615853658536586

Complete drippy Cheese Soap Opera dialogue & acting. Kevin Sabo is more prominent on the cover than in the movie. It's a don't ""hit pause"" for a bathroom-break kinda movie.

5943669,5,B00EU8RBXW,"This movie won the prestigious WRANGLER AWARD as given by the NATIONAL COWBOY & WESTERN HERITAGE MUSEUM in Oklahoma City for best television Western. When it showed on the Hallmark Movie Channel, it was the 2nd highest rated and 2nd most watched original movie in HMC network history, reaching 1.1 million unduplicated viewers.

It's a long way from novel to script to rewrites to screen, but Director David Cass Sr. held it all together.

My screenplay was based on my novel, SHADOW ON THE MESA, which is now scheduled for hard cover publication this fall with FIVE STAR PUBLISHING. The novel, of course, is the complete story and has more than one romance. It will soon be available for advance order on AMAZON under MN_131SBN.  To order hard cover novel: #9781432829629.  To order it as an E-Book:  #9781432829759.

Having grown up on a cattle ranch and with 17 published traditonal, action Western novels with AVALON BOOKS, I'm proud of this production. I also have a collection of over 500 Western movies, so I have a good frame of reference.

Again, I could not be more proud of this movie, the stars, the crew and Larry Levinson's outfit.

5943670,3,B00EU8RBXW,"Hard to make good, traditional Westerns nowadays, this Gaiam released Kevin Sorbo entry tries hard with mixed results to give us one.

A bounty hunter, of few words, learns that his mother is dead- brutally killed.  He seeks revenge, pursuing answers from his unmet, lost father, Ray(Sorbo).  Meantime, there's a range war going on between Sorbo's character and a greedy landowner.

This is a slow developing Western with the hero saying very little, often staring without a blink.  They want an old fashioned hero who doesn't waste words but  speaks with his actions and gun.  Sorbo's pretty much stuck crutchbound most of the movie until the grand shoot-out at the end.

There are several, typical gunplays here, usually, rider facing rider, lined up, and a shoot-out from the homestead at the finale.  The bad guys are bad, greedy and don't play fair.  They feature a few women, including Meredith Baxter(sans Birney) who has a short role at the start, and somewhat of a romance but not much.

We watch a lot of Gaiam's DVD's. and, in general, enjoy their offerings.  This one's well-made with lots of outdoor western shots and good production values.  We like Kevin ""Hercules"" Sorbo.  They picture him on the cover with two six shooters, a publicity shot only.  His Ray Eastman is no Eastwood.

Overall, a not bad Western, although a bit too serious needing passion, more humor, more romance, and definietly more originality.",1387670400,,1429,4.9411764705882355

Just enough blood so you know what part of the body someone was shot in.

5943673,2,B00EU8RBXW,"""If I get a hint that he had something to do with mom's death I will kill him."" After Wes (Brown) returns home he is told of his mother's death. After being told of who may be behind it he rides off for revenge. At this point I could almost just write one blanket review for every western that comes out and just change the movie titles. LONG GONE are the days of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, and even at this point Kevin Costner westerns. I'm not sure what happened but somewhere along the way the genre got relegated to made-for-TV movies on the Hallmark channel. I'm not saying that Hallmark movies are a bad thing but when you want to see a western a little roughness is needed in them. The swagger of John Wayne is replaced by the pretty boy look. The intensity of Eastwood is replaced with soft emotion laden characters that don't seem to fit in the west. If you want to get your wife or girlfriend to watch a western with you then show her the new ones. If you want to show her what a real western should be show her anything by John Wayne. Overall, another dagger in the genre that used to be known as western. Apparently all it takes to be a western now is people in cowboy hats riding horses. I give it a C.",1386633600,7,1219,4.169491525423729

I purchased the movie from Amazon, then while it was on its way, it appeared on TV and I watched part of it.  Then I watched it again when it arrived.  One oddity:  one part that I would have considered important was on TV but was not shown on the DVD.  That part was when the Kevin Sorbo character asked his wife about a missing letter and she denied ever getting it.  Wes Brown played a good part.  He was actually the main character but he didn't get much billing.  Many of the characters were likable:  Baldy and the ranch foreman, Wes Rawlins and Ray Eastman, and Eastman's daughter.  The wife and the Dowdy's were all nasties.  I almost cheered when Potluck got his just desserts.  I award stars on the basis of how much I enjoyed it.  I am not a movie critic.  So... I'm giving this one 5 stars.  No apologies.",1516579200,,896,4.281437125748503
