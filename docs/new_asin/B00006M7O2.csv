7972269,5,B00006M7O2,Its old film but have a lot of info. Thanks,1480896000,,43,3.4
7972270,5,B00006M7O2,"This video REALLY impressed me.. I have been buying martial arts videos for years and am always disappointed by the quality of most ""slapped up"" productions.

This video is definately the exception.  Very clear, well lit, concise material and audio that can actually be heard.. hallelujah.

The material covered is well rounded and informative.. Stances, grips and strikes are all covered in reasonable detail, allowing for months, if not years of study (actually more like practise material)

If you are looking for the quick fix, bridge guide to swords,  this is not the video for you. However if you are serious about learning and ready to put in the time to practise these forms diligently, then this is for you :) (more material covered in this video than 8 months at my local kenjutsu school)",1153612800,4,798,4.881481481481481
7972271,4,B00006M7O2,"This isn't the advanced video for the person wanting to clash with a practiced samurai.  But it is a start.  Not overly entertaining, sometimes vague, and a very basic level of instruction.  But on the other hand, if you start with this one...  I think one could watch and practice the stances and basic sword techniques shown for many weeks to months and be prepared for another step up the ladder of martial arts sword use.  There should be a series here to advance but nothing so far available.
  There is a bonus in this video that I greatly appreciated: explained the design of the ninja's sword!  Making one of these for practice is within most amature craftman's ability.  Can you say ""where's my local leaf-spring manufacturer?"" They can supply you with the non-heat treated steel, and can treat it when you have shaped it and put the holes where you want them.  I didn't expect this in the tape.
  I bought a Cold Steel Chisma Katana (24"") and thought it best to learn to use it.  But where on earth does one learn to use a sword in suburbia?  Videos!  I recommend this one to go with all the other videos needed to learn sword techniques.  Be careful! Don't bring a sword to a gun fight and have fun.",1078099200,4,1210,4.431818181818182
7972272,4,B00006M7O2,"Just about the only thing I learned off of this video was the japanese words for stances.  I mean I watched the video about 5 times and learned quickly the techniques on the video.  Its not very advanced at all.  For the price, I think its a waste of money, cut it in half and it would be a 5 star, but[$$$] for a VHS that one can master within a few days, come on.",1054425600,,365,3.84
7972273,5,B00006M7O2,"I got the video for Christmas and was so inspired that I went right out and built my own sword based on Mark Grove's specifications. I've had hours of enjoyment since, practicing the simple techniques therein. There's nothing really flashy or flowery about this video. What it contains is a small number of simple, rudimentary techniques and principles, that with dedication and practice, can build a strong foundation for further study. The production value of this video is the best I've seen in the martial arts genre...it truly raises the bar! Whether you're a seasoned martial artist looking to expand your base of knowledge, or a complete novice wanting to experience something unique and challenging, this video is well worth the money. Buy it!",1042675200,4,751,5.064516129032258
7972274,5,B00006M7O2,"Finally someone out there decided to put out something with some integrity!  I have seen so many martial arts instructionals that quite simply aren't worth squat.  This video presents swordsmanship that is REAL. It somehow echoes a sense of ancient seriousness and purity that contrasts sharply to the self serving,commercialized, or simply bogus video that is out there.
Production wise it is very entertaining with some amazing choreographed fights in the start and finish of the video that simply entertain and emphasize the skills of this school's top men.  Most videos I have seen seem to avoid that.  Clarity, editing and music just seem to elevate this video above the rest.  If you are really a swordplay buff and want to graduate from running around a park hitting your friends with sticks or you are currently a trained martial artist who wants to see what Kenjutsu a la Ninja truly is...see this. It will provide you with a serious and well developed program for forming fundamental swordskills that can not be disputed by any legitimate Japanese swordplay authority.",1037923200,,1078,5.033707865168539
7972275,5,B00006M7O2,"This is the best martial arts instructional I have ever seen.  Very informative, well shot, and it was long enough.  I get so tired of buying a video just to have some monkey swing a sword around ineffectually with production value less than that of a high school film student.  I suppose it is best to only have to sit through 10 minutes of this kind of ...
This video is great and I hope there are to be more from Master Grove.",1034294400,,429,4.144578313253012
