Where exactly were all the capitali$ts and CIA ""influence""to destroy any attempt at success? Where was Cuba? Where was Venezuela? Chile (the other 911, remember the democratically elected Allende?) and all the other countries we interfered with? Nothing. Interesting that Wattenberg and his cronies conflate socialism with communism, fascism and Nazi-ism. Blurring the line, I guess.
Just more Kapitali$t $$$$$$$ pouring into a grand bunch of lies...",1516924800,,575,5.545454545454546
8572037,5,B00BOYHXS8,"I really enjoyed all three episodes of this program.  This third episode concludes the series by discussing the transition of socialist governments toward free markets.  Those representing the Left found that certain market based incentives and structures are crucial to the proper functioning of society.  Tony Blair in the UK and Deng Xiaoping in China turn away from a complete commitment to the idea common ownership, paving the way for the Labour party to regain power in Britain and the economy to rapidly expand in China.",1436400000,,528,5.116279069767442
8572038,2,B00BOYHXS8,"While informative the show felt like it had a bias. It kept suggesting and the host enforced the idea that the various forms of communism and socialism just haven't worked. And that the American system, the capitalist system (while it's still in development) is the only one that has proven to work. I would say that there are plenty of countries around the world that lean much further towards socialism that are a more healthy society than the American system.",1394150400,2,462,4.7875

could not recommend at $14.99. Now I realize that Amazon is trying to sell
EACH flawed hour for that...making this inadequate series an insane $45.]

Okay, I should have been smarter: I sat down hoping/expecting to see
a reasonable, thoughtful examination of the history of Socialism.

Since I constantly hear ""socialism"" used essentially as an epithet in the U.S.
--despite the lack of any worthwhile agreed-upon working definition of the term--
I sincerely hoped to learn something.

My first clue that something was very wrong, was that the intro was by Ben Wattenberg.
Now, I like and respect BW, but anyone who knows anything about his politics
knows that he's absolutely not the guy to give you an objective treatment of socialism,
an institution he hates. It would be like a Raiders fan making a YouTube video
about my San Diego Chargers. Or Paul Krugman doing 3 excruciating hours on supply-side economics.

Further, the 3 hour series is based on a book by fellow hard-core neo-conservative
Joshua Muravchik. I'm not as familiar with him, but I'm guessing he'd be interesting
to read if the topic were, say, neo-conservative politics.

So, if you are the 1 person in 10,000 childishly wondering:
""What would the American Enterprise Institute like me to believe about socialism?""
then this series is for YOU! :)

For everyone else, or anyone looking for an academic, half-way objective treatment of socialism,
do not waste your time or money here.",1368921600,4,1537,4.984375
