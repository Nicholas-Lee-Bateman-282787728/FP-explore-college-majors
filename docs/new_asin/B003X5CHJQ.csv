8407808,4,B003X5CHJQ,"This is a nice collection of videos featuring Dr. Cornel West.  His intellectual analysis, his concern for the disenfranchised, his sharp wit, and performative style all are here.  Unfortunately many of the videos suffer from either poor video quality or poor audio quality, still Dr. West's deep humanity shows through.  If you are easily put off by low production quality, you will likely feel cheated by this disc; some of the video is of very low quality.  What you'll find is a collection of interviews from TV shows, college commencement speeches, and some performance.  All and all, worthwhile for those of us who appreciate what Dr. West brings to our lives.",1306281600,,666,4.963963963963964
