8078810,5,B000063JZG,"(Don't ask about the title- I'm a little obsesed...) but anyway this DVD and infact this whole series is something you do not want to miss! It combines a really good sense of humor with a very serious plot line...almost depressing at times...but then in the next scene you have Taikoubou, the main character, eating grass with Sibuxiang or something...Wait was this reveiw soposed to be on this DVD! Okay, this particular one is basically one big battle- a really cool, long, serious, and at times a really extremely funny one! It is a must have for those of you fallowing the series and my personal favorite. It has some really great scenes and Taikoubou defeats this bad guy, Ohma, is the coolest way! I only have two complaints: 1. grr...it leaves off right at the good part!! 2. I am sorry, I mean I really like the character Kisho, Lord of the West, but why did they have to put him on the cover with Youzen? It's no fair! Kou Tenka gets his own cover why shouldn't Youzen! I guess they did that because he is a very important character int the plot of the DVD(okay, I am over it)...but this simple thing was not enough to give this product 4 stars...Buy this DVD!",1026345600,,1169,4.441860465116279
