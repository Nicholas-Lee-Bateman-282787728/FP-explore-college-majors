8328663,5,B001O0TM8G,"I bought this for my nephew for Xmas who was captivated by it.  We already owned a copy and my kids still love it (7 and 9 years old) and knew my nephew would really enjoy it.  I found it to better than this other one (I forgot the title-it came as a 2-pack from Costco, I believe) that seemed to have a more negative overtone (more disparaging remarks).  This one is more uplifting and positive which is why I tended to show this one more than the other.  I also liked that it was not just a cartoon animated video, but with the  more charming real trains and figures and scenery with stop-motion-like animation.",1373587200,,613,4.2956521739130435
