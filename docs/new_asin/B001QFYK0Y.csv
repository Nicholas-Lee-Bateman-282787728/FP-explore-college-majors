8335633,3,B001QFYK0Y,"The editorial Review of this DVD in reference to Bhagwati Seva prompted me to purchase it. The video of the Homa, Ganapati Puja & Bhagavati Seva looks like an actual recording of the Puja performed for someone. The presentation (no cinematography) may not really be important for aspirants as long as the spoken language is not a barrier. The spoken language in the video is Malayalam. For someone who does not know Malayalam, one can not interpret the context, approach, objective, blessings and outcome of this rare practice. There are no subtitles or commentary either that can help comprehend the topic. There is very little available on the subject. I hope the maker of this DVD consider this feedback and help provide more information on the subject to aspirants.",1525132800,,769,4.9689922480620154
