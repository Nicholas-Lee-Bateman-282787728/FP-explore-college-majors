6898128,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I'm a long time Jessica Smith fan and love the variety of full-length free workouts on her youtube channel. I would say I am an intermediate exerciser and am currently pregnant, so I wanted the option to rotate shorter workouts. This dvd doesn't disappoint. It includes four separate 15 minute workouts. As always, Jessica is great at delivering fast-paced workouts in clear and easy to follow moves. These aren't boring routines and I loved the music.

6898138,5,B00R3LIB0A,"Am a big fan of Jessica's workouts  since I enjoy her energy.  Jessica presents so many different levels to include  ALL exercisers.  The 15 minute workouts can be done all at once, or whatever you have time for.  The music is pleasant and the instruction is easy to follow.  Her mother is one of the exercisers, and I typically  follow her.  The production values are excellent, and the outdoor venue of  Miami is relaxing.",1506902400,,424,4.621621621621622

6898146,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I'm a huge Jessica Smith fan, and this DVD has served me well when I'm short on time.  The dance party and belly blaster workout are nice moderate-intensity, fun workouts; the other two get my heart rate up a bit more and have me sweating in just 15 minutes.  I love that there is some variety in the goals of the workouts, depending on what you're feeling up to on a given day.  Not my go-to workout on a daily basis, but great for days when I oversleep or have a busy evening schedule.",1496534400,2,487,4.159574468085107
6898147,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I love it!  It's fun!  I'm lazy, so I really like being able to do 15-minute workouts.  Sometimes I do one before work; sometimes two in a day.  They are a great way to wake me up before work.  I get in between 1500 to 1800 steps with these workouts.  My favorite is Dance Party, but I like them all!",1494460800,3,300,3.9166666666666665

6898149,5,B00R3LIB0A,Great product from a great instructor. You can't go wrong with Jessica Smith.,1492905600,,77,5.0
6898150,5,B00R3LIB0A,"Jessica Smith is my new favorite walking instructor. She has a lot of energy and makes each session of walking fun and entertaining. In this DVD you will find four main workouts, each 15 minutes long.

The Fast Fat Burn is high energy and it whittles the waist. Jessica is giggly and talkative but gets the walking done fast.

Belly Blaster has footwork that is a bit fancy and Jessica's shoes are bright hot pink. The standing crunches in this workout are excellent.

Power Pick Up is energizing and gets the lymph flowing as you are doing a lot of arm raises.

Dance Party doesn't have any complicated steps and is not overly sensual. It is more country music inspired.

With addictive moves and motivating music you will be inspired to do two workouts at a time. This is great if you only have 30 minutes to exercise. Highly Recommended!

6898151,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I just recently started using this DVD on my laptop while traveling and staying in a hotel for two weeks.  My average-size room had plenty of space, because you just need to be able to take a few steps to either side, front, and back.  If you have a lot of room, open up your step distance and you will get even more out of the exercise, but if your space is cramped, you can take smaller steps and still get a good workout.  I found her moves very easy to follow (I have always had difficulty following aerobic/zumba/dance moves) and easy to adjust my intensity as I get stronger (I have bad back/knees/feet so I have to start out very easy).  In the hotel I did the first 15-minute workout every day.  Now that I'm back home, I still choose to use this DVD on my laptop, and have added the second 15-minute workout to my routine (for a total of 30 minutes).  If you want to use it for travel, like I did (and will again), you still need athletic shoes, but can minimize/simplify/eliminate your workout clothes because you don't have to leave your room to do your workout.",1491782400,3,1073,4.313432835820896
6898152,5,B00R3LIB0A,I have a couple of Jessica's DVDs but this is my favorite. The 15 minutes go quickly and if you want a longer workout then just continue to the next one(s). My husband saw a difference in my shape after I had been doing this DVD for about a week. I love that there are three different people at three different levels that you can follow.,1491350400,4,338,4.136363636363637
6898153,5,B00R3LIB0A,"This workout video is perfect for me.  I have a bad knee and can do these four workouts following the third person in the trio, whom is doing the low impact routine.  Fifteen minutes is short enough for me to NOT lose attention or give up, and I still get a good aerobic workout and work up a little sweat.

6898156,5,B00R3LIB0A,"This is a great workout and you can push yourself or just do the steps without the arms if desired.  I really feel great afterwards and I have three of her workouts but I like this the best because I can do one or more and feel like I really exercised even with just one segment. If you want a fifteen minute workout that will get you going and the heart rate up to burn those calories, this is the one,  You can do all four and really really get that body in shape.",1488326400,3,466,3.9468085106382977

6898167,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I love the quick blasts of working out in this dvd, she gives you maximum work in 15 minutes.  Hands down one of my favorite Jessica workouts (granted I enjoy them all!).  Jessica has made me go from a beginner in working out to just above an intermediate in just about 3-4 months.  I do 74 minutes 5 times a week with Jessica and it feels GREAT! :)  --  I have coupled this work out with ""Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan"", and currently with ""Jessica Smith Walk On: Walk the Weight Off 30 Day Plan (Low Impact High Results Program)"".

6898170,5,B00R3LIB0A,I really like this DVD. I have been a long time fan of Leslie Sansone and pretty much have all off her tapes. I was staring to get a bit bored and was looking for something different so I tried this. When I purchased the DVD Jessica sent me an email thanking me for my purchase and offering her support. You don't get great customer service like that hardly at all anymore so I was very appreciative. This DVD hit the spot for me. The 15 minute segments are a perfect way to jump start my day and I have found that the time goes pretty fast. I will be purchasing more of Jessica's dvds to add variety to my daily workout.,1479340800,6,621,4.098360655737705

6898172,4,B00R3LIB0A,"This is a really nice change from Leslie Sansone and others. Different, fun steps and a good, high-energy attitude without the constant blather and cackling that mars so many of Leslie's workouts. The 15-minute segments are invigorating, and you can easily work up a sweat if you want. She offers a moderate workout, a modified workout and a higher intensity workout, as demonstrated throughout by the three walkers. Also, the music isn't as awful and monotonous as most exercise CDs. I plan to get another one of her CDs! Hope she has one with weights, or makes one soon.",1479254400,2,572,4.787878787878788
6898173,1,B00R3LIB0A,Yeah I was dumb enough to buy this video too. Same issue. She is terrible at leading people to the next transitioned step AND if you watch her closely she tires out and gets off the walking beat of the music.,1478736000,,208,4.097560975609756
6898174,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I love Jessica Smith...she's pretty much the only fitness instructor that I don't start to hate after a few minutes.  Most instructors are, in my opinion, obnoxious and have an unrealistic view of what the average home exercise user is capable of. Jessica is much easier to follow and keep up with, and the workouts on this DVD are easy to do even for someone like me who is pretty clumsy and out of shape. I got this workout to try in the mornings, and I have been able to do one or two of the routines every morning for several weeks now. That may not sound very impressive, but my entire life I've never been able to workout in the morning. I have tried different things, other videos and jogging etc, and this is the only thing I have found that gets me moving when I'm half awake. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a routine that they can actually do and stick with.",1477958400,,880,4.269461077844311
6898175,4,B00R3LIB0A,"Good short workouts.  I wanted an alternative to Leslie Sansone.  I really like Jessica's voice and comments throughout this DVD; not too much; not too little. Other workout DVD instructors can get a bit annoying with the constant chatter and sometimes forced banter between her and the other group of walkers. :D
so, I do really like that Jessica only has two other walkers with her in the video and she is the only one doing the talking. I also like that each exerciser in the video does a different intensity of workout.  so, if you want low impact, you follow Jessica's Mother's moves in the video. If you are game for a higher intensity workout, you follow Beth.  I do agree with other reviewers that some of the moves were a little complicated.  but, on the other hand, I was looking for something different on the exercise moves than what I had been doing with other videos.  So, that's okay.  If I cannot do a move, I simply keep walking.  Jessica uses a lot more arm movements with each walk step than I am used to on other videos.  One thing I do like about Leslie Sansone is that she always counts down to the next move an announces what that next exercise move will be.  Jessica doesn't.  she just goes into the next step. I found that a little frustrating.  I also didn't really work up a sweat with this video.  I'm going to see if Jessica has another video where you exercise for one mile, two miles, etc. to see if they are comparable to what I have been doing with other videos.  all in all though, I really like the variety in moves and I will definitely try out some of Jessica's other videos.",1477958400,,1612,4.365771812080537

I especially appreciate the low impact movements, bright background, and classical music that is used at certain points. The main con that I find is that at times I feel the steps are unnecessarily complicated. One of the major reasons why I am a huge fan of Leslie Sansone's DVD series is because her steps are so easy to follow, even for someone who has two left feet! I appreciate Leslie's simple yet effective steps and emphasis on correct form. Although this DVD provides a somewhat refreshing change in background and music from Leslie Sansone's style, I do not think it will become a favorite.",1469836800,4,658,4.730434782608696

I have the 15 Minute Fast Fat Blasts, the 21 Day Weight Loss Plan, and the 10,000 Steps Weight Loss DVDs, as well as her Stretching DVD and Total Body Balance DVD.  It is great for me, as I have found it is good to take a break from the jumping up and down on some of my other DVDs.  My knees would ache by the end of the evening after a workout.  Sometimes even an Epsom salt bath did not seem to help my soreness.  Coupling the walking DVDs with the stretching DVD, I have moved these DVDs to the top of my workout regimen. Jessica gives you a real workout without placing a lot of stress on your knees.  Sometimes I don't even feel like Im exercising, as I am having more fun again. Jessica is truly helping me enjoy exercising and total body and mind balance.",1464825600,,868,4.100591715976331

I especially like the ""standing crunches"" as someone who has a bad back and not so great knees, getting up and down off the floor is not pleasant.

I'm 49 years old and have some old sports injuries, so high-impact aerobics are not good for me - but I desperately needed to get aerobically in shape. This series has done the trick. And the Ab routine is great - it's a lot of standing/moving crunches which help with not only abs, but balance and you burn more calories then laying on the floor to do sit-ups. You can also make this work out more intense - just follow the person doing the intense version and add the intensity wherever you feel you need to!!!",1458864000,2,573,4.256880733944954

All of us are in the 59+ age group and these 15 minute workouts are perfect for us.  We can all do it and we feel it is giving us a better workout than anything else we have tried.  I enjoyed it so much that I recently purchased the 30 day workout and am anxious to start that program!

I had wanted to try her professional DVDs and thought this would be the perfect start. They're short, sweet, and definitely to the point. My super all-time favorite is the dance party, because it just doesn't feel like EXERCISE. You're just having a blast with your BFF Jessica, Beth and her Mom (which is totally awesome, BTW).

Sometimes, I do all four in a row to get the ultimate 4-mile walk in and I always feel energized and revved for the day :)

I've been working out with Jessica for about 2 years now and am down a total of 60 pounds. I've got about 30 more pounds I want to lose (at least) and am so glad I found her upbeat, friendly attitude to help me stay on track!",1458345600,3,790,4.26

She has some really fun walk routines that are just about the right length for someone like me who is trying to squeeze in a quick workout before heading off to work... she is a lot of fun too.  Her routines add some refreshing new moves to my walks, so now I have even more quick walks to rotate  and keep away the boredom factor.  If you are a Walk at Home fan, I would suggest giving Jessica a chance as well.  Both ladies do a great job, and both have good personalities to keep you motivated.

The music is upbeat and gets me going.  The instructor is not annoying as some other workout DVDs can be.  There is always 15 minutes to work out.  Sometimes, I will do one in the morning and another one in the evening.  Great for the winter when it is too cold out to walk. I am glad I made the purchase.",1457654400,4,449,3.6736842105263157

I feel I get a really good workout from them and these are a nice change from Leslie Sansone's workouts, of which I have a few. I wish it was programmable like the first one I purchased, but it not a big deal to go to another workout (I usually will do a minimum of 30 minutes).

I am sometimes pushed for time and thought there is no reason why I can't put in 15 minutes a day for my health. I'm not what you call ""in shape"" and find this was perfect but at the same time challenging. There are three levels going on at all times. Her mother stays on the beginners level (my current level), Jessica and Beth are more advanced so it doesn't matter if you're just starting out like me or if you are more in shape. My eight year old daughter even works out with Jessica. This DVD are great! Who doesn't have 15 minutes to spend on their health? Jessica has really made something for us that is amazing and excuse free. Thank you so much Jessica!!",1456790400,,811,4.300653594771242

I combine this with other DVDs, depending on time I have. But almost any day I can find 15 minutes to do SOMETHING, as I hope you can.
The addition of her mum as one doing no impact, lovely. And Jessica has the perfect, encouraging but not bullying voice to get those who don't feel they can do it--to do it.",1456790400,,374,4.208333333333333

6898237,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I'm new to Jessica's workouts, but I loved these so much that I immediately ordered her Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan DVD (which I'm starting on this week).  I think Leslie Sansone's great, but after years of doing her workouts, some of them can be a bit boring and repetitive, so I wanted a new ""brand"" of walking.

But first a bit about me:  I'm 48 years old and can have very painful knee joints and suffer chronic lower back pain.  I used to be a rigorous, avid exerciser but am just getting back into fitness and exercising daily after a long hiatus.  I stay mobile, and you'd never guess I have such bad back pain to look at me, I just have to choose my workouts wisely.

These 4 workouts have great variety and pack a lot into 15 minutes so that you feel you've had a good workout even when you're pressed for time or low on motivation.  THERE'S NO DREAD FACTOR WITH THESE WORKOUTS, and that's a huge plus in my book!  I mean, nobody wants to dread their workouts, right?  We're way more inclined to actually EXERCISE when we don't have to talk ourselves into putting on workout gear & loading the DVD.

Jessica, her mom, and her friend demonstrate different levels of intensity, and you feel you're getting a solid workout with all of the options.  The production quality is great, and the instructor is encouraging, fun, and talkative without being annoying or just too much to take.  Her cuing is practically flawless.  She also adds variety and interest to ""walks"" that I didn't even think were possible after doing Leslie Sansone for so long (and don't get me wrong - I love Leslie!)  You don't have to be coordinated or graceful to do these workouts effectively (because I'm neither!).

You could easily just do one of these for a nice workout or combine two or more for a bit more of a challenge, depending on the time and/or motivation you may have on any given day.  These are terrific for any age and they're easy on the joints.

Buy without hesitation or fear, and HAVE FUN!  I have many workout DVDs, and this one is now in heavy rotation!",1455580800,8,2061,4.4217506631299734

It feels like I'm working out with a friend when I work out with her videos. Now, for the workout.  I love her 4, 15 minute walks.  They are easy to follow, quick and make you feel amazing after.  For me, going through an hour long DVD can become monotonous. But with every 15 minute section on Walk On, I find myself moving onto the next 15 minute segment.
I workout daily, but I am not as active daily as I used to be.  In college I would walk miles around campus in addition to my gym workout, so I am supplementing my workouts now with DVDs to round out my activity levels. This DVD is perfect for that! I feel energized and healthy after doing this DVD. I use a fitness tracker and love that I get my heart rate up and get in more steps. Overall, I love This workout and highly recommend it.

She has great choreography, cuing, and her workouts are just fun! I actually look forward to working out to her DVD's. I feel like I get a complete workout in a small amount of time with her videos. I feel like I am working out with a friend! I highly recommend all of Jessica Smith's Walk On DVD's.
Also, I have contacted Jessica's customer service and I have to say, she has the best customer service that I have seen in a long time.  Good customer service is hard to find these days. If you want a great workout along with superior customer service, buy Jessica's DVD's! You will be so glad that you did!",1448064000,4,970,4.295081967213115
6898265,5,B00R3LIB0A,I got this because of a review I read & I'm glad I did! Great workouts & high calorie burn. The only thing I would have liked is the option to play them all as one continuous routine. Still a great DVD with great results.,1447459200,,221,3.933333333333333

6898267,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I really like this DVD!  It offers energetic workouts without complicated steps, although they incorporate some familiar Zumba movements.  I also like that the workouts are divided into four 15-minute segments, so I have options based on how much time I have, how ambitious I'm feeling, etc.  I've found that even one 15-minutes workout is a good one.  I have Zumba and Body Kombat DVDs that I also enjoy, but this is a good addition to my library so I can ""cross-train.""  I definitely feel that I'm using different muscles with the Walk On workout.  Two thumbs up :-)",1446595200,2,568,4.686868686868687

I hope she keeps these workouts coming!",1446249600,,317,4.745454545454545
6898271,5,B00R3LIB0A,I own a couple of Jessica's dvd's in this one does not disappoint. She has made these workouts to fit anyone who is a beginner to intermediate exerciser. She has a great personality and is very down to earth. She has included her mom and another friend who are doing different levels of intensity so it is easy to find your groove. I love walking and she makes it so much fun and I love how you can choose to do 1 or more walks in 15 minute intervals. You can find her on YouTube to try her out  and I am sure you will love her.,1445990400,,528,3.9345794392523366

6898273,5,B00R3LIB0A,"My wife loves her Jessica Smith TV workouts and loves to add to her growing collection of DVD's. This DVD comes with 4 challenging workouts that you can supplement to another workout or complete all at once. Each walk is 15 minutes but Jessica packs a punch with each one. There is always the option to modify the walks or add a tougher interval as needed. Jessica always encourages to listen to your body, but always take care of your body.",1443657600,,441,4.45679012345679

6898275,3,B00R3LIB0A,"This is an ok video, but definitely not as good as I was expecting after reading other reviews.  I have done all of the workouts included on the video and have found that none of them give me a very good workout.  I barely work up a sweat even when following the ""more challenging"" version of the exercises.  Let me assure you this isn't because I'm already fit - jogging a 1/4 mile makes me out of breath.  I find myself adding in extra things that I've learned from other videos I've used just so that I feel like I've got a decent workout.  Jessica does have a lot of energy and isn't as annoying as some of the other workout videos on the market, but it doesn't seem like the other women on the video have ever done the workout with her before.  It felt kind of thrown together.  Some of the moves can be hard to follow the first couple of times you do them.",1443225600,8,862,4.125748502994012

I love these 15 minute walks because they are perfect for giving myself a ""shot"" of cardio and I can sprinkle them throughout my day. I think I may enjoy these short walks more than the DVDs with the longer 30 minute walks for that exact reason.

6898290,5,B00R3LIB0A,Nice energetic walk in short time frame.  You can get an excellent workout that does raise heartbeat. I like that I can combine to make it short or long. Jessica is one of my favorite instructors for her workouts. Her cues are great. She has two other with higher and low impact versions which make all of her workouts fit your needs.,1440201600,,334,4.387096774193548
6898291,4,B00R3LIB0A,"I love Leslie Samsone and was encouraged by the reviews to try these DVD's.  Good workout, but the brightness of the set is a little distracting.  Nice change of pace from others and easy to follow.",1440201600,,198,4.472222222222222
6898292,4,B00R3LIB0A,"As with all of Jessica Smith's DVDs this is beautifully produced and well executed.  You can do just one work out or combine them, but the menu is not interactive so if you decide to combine them you are going to have to have your remote close by to pick the next one.  These are not repeats of any of her other workouts, shot outdoors with her mom and Beth, who has appeared on a couple of her recent DVDs.

There are a couple of them I didn't particularly enjoy - Fast Fat Burn and Power Pick Up I'm looking at you.  Not that they were hard, since you can choose who to follow any of them can be what you make of them but some of the quick stuff is just a little too pylo for me.

All in all, another winner from Jessica and it will hold an up front spot in my DVD workout collection.",1440115200,,786,3.949367088607595

6898295,5,B00R3LIB0A,I've used Leslie Sansone videos for years and this is a great alternative.  Jessica is upbeat without being annoying and the 15 minutes fly by.  I like the fact that she has 4 different routines to choose from.  I sit at my desk for sometimes 12 hours in a day and I find that fitting in 15 minutes and walking to these videos is easy to do.  At the end of the 15 minutes I'm energized and more focused.  A great way to lower my stress levels and get some steps in during the day.,1439251200,2,480,4.010526315789473

I am new to Jessica Smith, but so far I LOVE her!!!  She is now one of my favorite trainers & I really hope she continues to create more DVDs (i don't really like to do YouTube workouts due to my shaky Internet).

I am also a big fan of Leslie Sansone, but I must admit--I like Jessica's style & personality a lot better.  I bought this DVD along with her Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan.  I was so amazed by these DVDs that I went ahead & just ordered her new Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles DVD & her 10 pounds down DVD.

Other reviewers already did a great job of breaking down the walk segments on this DVD, so I don't need to do that. But, I do have to mention that the belly walk is fantastic--it really works the core!!  I really prefer standing ab workouts as opposed to floor exercises.

I am very satisfied with this purchase!!",1433980800,8,1012,4.106598984771574
6898311,5,B00R3LIB0A,"Excellent video. Makes you sweat through all of it. Especially like the 15 minute video for my abs. Because of neck issues, floor exercises for my abs didn't work well. I recommend this highly??",1433980800,,194,4.735294117647059

I've got a very busy life & after a 10hr day with a 1 1/2 to 2hr commute I really don't have a lot of time left in the day to go to a gym or do a crazy long workout so doing two of these workouts in my living room works great for me.

6898314,5,B00R3LIB0A,"Love this DVD. I started exercising an hour a day 7 months ago with Zumba Exhilarate, but the high-impact was killing me. So I went in search of something better and found it!

This DVD is good for beginner to intermediate levels because you can kick up the moves as you progress. Jessica does multiple moves in each 15 minute section and right as I'm panting and dying she'll move onto walking in place and then something else that uses a different part of my body. This keeps my heart rate up, me moving and no death by exercise to date! This is fabulous in my opinion as I never lost hope or gave up which is what happens most often when exercise is difficult.

I've noticed this program builds better core muscles than Zumba and I'm thrilled with the results! I recently started adding some weights and picking my feet up higher for a more intense workout.

I like Jessica's instructions and commentary, don't find it annoying at all. The music is largely white noise in the background and I only rarely notice it. So that's not annoying either!

For reference: I'm 5'9"", 240 pounds and never followed an exercise program in my life. I've always been overweight (starting at age 5) and I began exercising with a back so bad I was on disability. This DVD was completely doable and I chose my intensity levels as I went. I've progressed beautifully. Highly recommended!",1433894400,7,1371,4.583673469387755

Looking for something different, I found Jessica's videos on YouTube and started from there. You'll never get bored with her workouts and her positive energy is contagious!! This DVD has been a nice fit to my schedule for busy days or for those days that I have zero energy. The other day I was completely exhausted and in a little bit of a funk, I decided to do the Power Walk workout. About 5 minutes in I was smiling and felt refreshed - after the workout I had energy throughout the rest of the evening. These workouts can also compliment another workout, but they are effective on their own as well. These workouts are enough to give you an energy boost, have some fun, and leave you feeling refreshed - not exhausted! I absolutely love Jessica - she has been an inspiration and I will continue to support her.",1431043200,24,989,4.5307262569832405

6898326,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I love these workouts.  Walk On includes four 15-minute walking programs, each having it's own (very brief) cool down/stretch section at the end.  They're excellent for beginner and intermediate exercisers.  Not very challenging, but you can step up the intensity by jogging instead of walking (as Jessica has one of her two backups do on occasion), or use hand weights, as I do.  One-pound weighted gloves work well for me.  If you're concerned with step count, each 15-minute segment adds roughly 1,500 steps on my Fitbit.

I especially enjoy these videos thanks to the instructor, Jessica Smith - I am not normally a fan of peppy workout videos, but she seems to be an exception.  She's peppy without being irritating, very pleasant and encouraging, and her cueing is good.  And important to me, she doesn't stick with any one move long enough that I'm ever thinking, COME ON, let's get on with it.

When I don't have much time I've done only one of the workouts, there have also been days that I've done all four.  The moves are varied enough that it doesn't get boring, but I'd imagine it might if you didn't mix it up with other videos.

Overall, I would recommend to anyone who isn't looking for an extreme workout - especially to anyone who just needs a little motivation to get moving.",1430697600,5,1294,4.68141592920354

If I'm doing that much walking I want to have fun doing it and this is fun.",1429401600,,247,3.3508771929824563
6898333,5,B00R3LIB0A,I loved this work-out. Jessica is so motivating and her instructions and pace are very clear. I started with just 1 walk and after 15 minutes I was inspired to do the next and the next and the next. The hour went by so quickly and I had energy all day. I did not find the exercises very challenging but it was a refreshing change from other traditional cardio DVDs. Walking is a great form of exercise (often the benefits underestimated) and I think both beginners and seasoned exercisers will like this series. Glad I found this. Keep up the great work Jessica!,1429228800,,562,4.466019417475728

6898339,5,B00R3LIB0A,"As a big fan of Jessica I'm so happy she's come out with these short workouts which pack a punch in a small amount of time!  They're perfect for add-ons: I usually do one or two in addition to either one of her YouTube videos or other DVDs.  The time flies and her enthusiasm and cheery spirit are infectious.  I'm happy that first segment, Fast Fat Burn, is basically a toned down version of HIIT.  I know that HIIT has a lot of pros to it but I absolutely hate doing HIIT routines - with Fast Fat Burn I at least feel I'm get a bit of HITT's benefits without a lot of strain and no ""dread factor.""  While I love her 21 day weight loss DVD set I've only done the HIIT portion once so with the Fast Fat Burn I don't feel as guilty.  Belly Blaster is very targeted and great for days when you're too spent for an entire cardio core workout.  Power Pick Up may be the gentlest of the 4 but Jessica as usual is sneaky and it packs a bigger punch than you'd think.  My personal favorite is Dance Party, which is exactly as it sounds.  Jessica says it's all about fun (it is) but it's also an effective workout.  Although none of these are very intense I did work up a sweat and think they'd be a wonderful introduction for beginners or others who have taken a rest from exercise and want to start again (such as myself).  Jessica's mom, Debbie, demonstrates the basics with no difficult moves while her friend Beth is there for higher impact modifications that would suit those at an intermediate level.  All and all delightful little routines.  I hope Jessica comes out with more of these shorter workouts because you can mix and match on days when you have more energy, add one onto another workout, or do one or two on days when you just don't feel like exercising.  Highly recommend!",1428624000,3,1783,4.299401197604791

Wonderful scenery and Beth and Debbie add a lot to the workouts.

6898345,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I love Jessica Smith, and I love these ""Walk on"" DVDS. These are perfect for those with any type of injury that doesn't allow them to get on the floor or jump around like a crazy person. No floor work makes this even better. Especially for those with poor core and arm strength, floor workouts are insanity, same with those that have injuries. These are challenging, yet doable and fun which makes you want to try harder. These are perfect to play all together for a long walk, or if you want to add on some time to your workout, need something easier to rest your body, or just want a quick pick me up. So many options with these, and her whole workout team has easier and harder levels for you to follow. You can make this as hard as you want. I love being a part of the #JSTVfit team! Now for calorie burn. I am giving an average here. If you're heavier, you'll burn more, thinner less calories etc etc. This is a range. I have a polar FT7, female, very early 30s, (5'7 height and currently 168)  and on average for these DVDs I burn about 150-200 calories per 15 walk. (Today for instance did the ""Belly Blaster"" DVD and burned 178 calories. Or another time did  ""Fast Fat Burn"" and ""Dance Party"" and burned  348 calories, so 174 calories individually.) I love the endless possibilities with these. Also own ""Walk On: 21 day weight loss plan"" and love that too!!!! Jessica is a great instructor, perfect mix of direction, humor and happiness. She may start off slow to warm you up, but she packs a punch that anyone can do. That is what I loveeee about these DVDs! It makes you want to try, and not get so frustrated that you want to give up. This is what everyone needs, especially beginners.",1427155200,10,1697,4.347003154574132

I thought I needed something to get me going again, so after hearing so many wonderful things about this DVD, I thought I'd give it a try. Since the workouts are only 15 minutes long, and since I already know I love Jessica Smith workouts, I thought I couldn't lose by getting this DVD. I was so right!! Actually, to be honest, I've only done the Dance Party and the Fast Fat Blast workouts so far, and I love them so much that I feel like I already got my money's worth, even if I end up hating the other two workouts (which I'm sure I won't!). These workouts seem so upbeat and Jessica and her cohorts (a friend and her mom), seem to be having so much fun. I just can't help but smile and wave at Jessica and her team at the end of each workout (or curtsy, as we did at the end of the Dance Party). Thanks so much, Jessica, for another great workout DVD. I'll add this one to my growing fitness DVD collection. I'm sure I'll get lots of use out of it for a long time to come.",1425600000,,1066,4.033018867924528

6898358,4,B00R3LIB0A,"Jessica Smith leads four 15 Minute indoor walks on this DVD, this is the first walk on the disc: Fast Fat Burn. This was an interval workout with some newish moves, such as side steps into traveling jumping jacks. The impact was there if you wanted it, but Jessicas mom, Debbie, was showing the modifications. It seemed to pack a lot into the 15 minutes, and just felt good with a nice flow.
Belly Blaster - This one was also good, it had some new and different ab moves within the context of a walking workout. I love the innovation in these, definitely don't feel like the normal walking workouts that I'm used to.
Power Pick Up - Jessica describes this one as a pick me up when you are low energy, and I appreciate that there are some different moves here, but not a lot of impact so it really felt like something that would boost energy without leaving you drained.
Cardio Dance - This was super fun, almost entirely low impact (with Debbie modifying as needed), there is one suggestion of a jump, but I felt that it was more of a bounce into the end of a grapevine. I may be in the minority (especially if you poll houseguests and neighbors) but I love clapping in a workout. It feels like being cheered on, even if the only person cheering is myself. This one had tons of clapping, so of course I loved it, and the crowd went wild. Well done, Jessica.",1425340800,25,1357,4.325490196078431

I'm almost 58 years old and have been able to do all her workouts. She always has a modified version of everything, which is great for beginners and those who have physical issues that would hinder them from doing other types of workouts.

I think the dance option wasn't bad.  The fat burning was pretty good as well.  I rely on these to supplement with the Walk On series.  My other fear is that I will get bored with this and Walk On 21 days program in a few months.

If Jessica's team is monitoring the feedback - I really hope that Jessica will consider creating a 90 day walk plan using her catalog of workouts from YouTube - she has some good ones that could combine to make a series of workout rotations into a great 90 day plan (or the ""Best Of"" series of Jessica's workouts:  she has step, barre, standing abs, HIIT, strength training, etc).

6898374,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I am on a Jessica Smith kick, having started with her YouTube videos.  I was using these videos as my second workout of the day after sitting at a computer for many hours.
I am happy to support Jessica since she is so generous in providing so many free YouTube videos.

This and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-On-21-Day-Weight-Loss-Plan/dp/B00R0HUEWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan</a>&nbsp;are my two new favorites.  I was very skeptical about 15 minute workouts, but now I'm hooked.  I use these workouts as an add-on to other workouts, or as a quick pick-me-up during the day.

This DVD has:
* FAST FAT BURN:  Moves include front and side steps, jacks, jogging, and hamstring curls.
* BELLY BLASTER: It's all standing ab work-with moves like standing crunches, torso twists, side steps standing crunches and v steps.
* POWER PICKUP: Moves like fast walking, other walking patterns, knee ups with arms, v steps, arm patterns, skaters.
* DANCE WALK: Moves like hand clasps, step taps, side steps, circle moves.

There are 3 exercises in each routine.  Jessica, Debbie (Jessica's Mom) who is doing an easier version of the moves, and Beth, who is doing a more advanced version of the moves.

Why I love this DVD:
* Jessica.  She is real, she is enthusiastic and she makes me smile.
* The moves are fun!  It doesn't feel like exercise, it's more about getting up and moving and feeling fantastic after you're done.
* The peppy and fun music.  The music perfectly fits the moves, so you are inspired to keep your energy up.
* The pretty setting.  It's so nice to see sunshine and an inviting pool.  I live in New England where it is often cold and grey.  This set helps me escape.

If you are looking for some fun ways to add movement into your life, you will enjoy this DVD.",1421884800,128,1855,4.897435897435898
6898375,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I preorderd this dvd the second I found out about it and received it this week. I have been using JessicaSmithTV youtube and dvd workouts for years and I really love her style and personality!

This Walk On: 15 minute Fast Fat Blasts dvd includes (4) Fat Blasting Fitness Walks-<strong>no equipment necessary</strong>.

1. FAST FAT BURN: (15:40 mins) some of the moves include side steps, jacks, jogging, and hamstring curls.
2. BELLY BLASTER: (15:58 mins) Standing Ab work-some of the moves include torso twists, side steps, standing crunches, and v steps.
3. POWER PICKUP: (15:58 mins) some of the moves include speed walking, patterns, knee ups with arms, v steps, arm patterns, skaters.
4. DANCE WALK: (16:10 mins) some of the moves include fist pumps, step taps, side steps, mixer circles, and hand clasps. Very fun workout!

In every workout Jessica is in the middle; Debbie is on my right who does the simplified moves; and Beth is on my left who does the more challenging moves. All three women are upbeat, smiling, and make the workouts more fun!

Each workout includes 1-2 minutes of a warm up and cool down. The moves are fast paced, and at times the patterns are a little complicated, so I wouldn't recommend this dvd to an absolute beginner. If you like fitness walking, like Leslie Sansone workouts, I think you will love this one!

I highly recommend this new Jessica Smith dvd, especially if you want a quick, effective workout!",1421193600,45,1444,4.82995951417004

6898377,5,B00R3LIB0A,"I am an avid fan of Jessica's workout DVDs.  I eagerly purchased this when it became available.  This is an excellent DVD, with four 15-minute routines, designed to be used alone, as quick, efficient workout routines, or in addition to other routines.  Alternatively, all four can be combined for an efficient, effective hour long workout.

The DVD includes four, 15-minute standing routines that require minimal space, NO equipment and are EXCELLENT for traveling.  The routines are shot outdoors in Florida.  A great pick me up considering my 20 below temperatures in the Midwest!!!  These routines are designed for all fitness levels, and include beginner (Jessica's lovely Mom Debbie), intermediate (Jessica) and advanced (Beth).  The workouts each have a different ""focus"" with workout 1 (Fast Fat Burn) being an efficient, standing cardio routine, with walk/jog intervals.  Workout 2 (Belly Blaster) is a standing ab routine with twists and high knee marches among others, designed to work the abdominals without having to lay on the floor, and in a 360-degree fashion.  Workout 3 (Power Pick Up) is a great routine to do first thing in the morning, or if you just don't feel like working out, but don't let the name fool you, while it's the gentlest of the routines, it still gets the job done.  Workout 4 (Dance Party) is a fun, dance-inspired walk that features moves such as the grape vine, step and clap, and lasso-arms (really fun).

Versus some of Jessica's other walking DVDs, there are new moves and variation with these routines.  Like I mentioned, I feel they are great additions to other routines, or if you just need a quick ""pick me up"".  Because of modifiers, these are designed for all levels.  While not as intense as some of Jessica's other DVDs (Cardio Abs etc), effort and intensity level adds variation and increases calorie burn.

For reference, I am a more intermediate to advanced exerciser, and ~140 lbs, 5'7. (female, thirties).  On average, I burned 150-175 calories per 15 minute routine using a mix of intermediate to advanced options throughout the routines.

I feel this DVD is an excellent addition to my fitness collection, and one I fully intend on using regularly in addition to my other programs.",1420761600,123,2238,4.986522911051213
