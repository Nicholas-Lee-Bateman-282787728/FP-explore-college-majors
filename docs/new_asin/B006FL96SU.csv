When I bought this collection, I was really disappointed that they repeated so many song videos that were already in the Shah Rukh Khan collection.  The movies that were represented in the Shah Rukh Khan collection had many other song videos that did not include Shah Rukh Khan that I would think would be excellent choices to put in this ""Top 50 Reloaded"" collection.

Yash Raj could have released two fine Blu-Ray video collections without repeating any videos between the two and would have made having both of them as a better value.

Well, Yash Raj still has many song videos to make a few more Bollywood song video collections.  I hope that that is the plan in the near future.

I wonder why other Bollywood movie entities aren't releasing any Blu-Ray films or song video collections yet? They are such an improvement over the less-than-stellar DVD releases over the years.",1342137600,,981,4.809523809523809
8497055,5,B006FL96SU,"This bluray has many big positives to offset the lack of subtitles. Beautiful menu, lots of my favorite music moments plus many I haven't seen before, and kickin' digital surround audio.

Another big plus: Sometimes a Bollywood movie begins or ends with a music number and have credits and titles scrolling across the screen, which kinda spoils it for me.  This bluray has some of those music numbers but without the credits and titles.  A nice touch!

One more big plus: Aishwarya Rai in HD! Nuff said!

I was a bit disappointed in the last 3 videos since they were from older movies in a 4:3 format. This didn't make much sense since there are dozens of other great item numbers from more recent movies they could have used. Still, that's 47 fun things to watch.

So, what are you waiting for?  Get it!

8497056,5,B006FL96SU,"Really impressed with the superior quality of the bluray. The songs are pretty good. $46 is too high for a Bluray. I think it should be less than $20. I don't know why Indian blurays are  so expensive. The average price for a Tamil bluray is $30. Most of the Hindi moves are reasonably priced.

Yash Raj BluRays are superb. Keep up the good quality.",1335398400,,349,4.3538461538461535
