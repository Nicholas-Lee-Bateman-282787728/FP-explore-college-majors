But these tapes are really good, you should look into this if you don't have any of them......the only tape that will bore you is Survivor Series but it had a couple good moments. The rest of the tapes are awesome.
Best at Rumble- The Rumble Itself
Best at Wrestlemania- Owen vs. Triple H or Outlaws vs. Cactus Jack/Funk
Best at KOTR- Mankind vs. Undertaker (Best KOTR ever)
Best at Summerslam- Rock vs. HHH (Ladder, IC title)
Best at Survivor Series- I think i fell asleep during this one but if my memory serves me it's Austin vs. Mankind

7892295,5,6305604053,"Some of the best events of the attitude era, should have made a 5 classics of 1999, but oh well",1368576000,,95,3.8
7892296,5,6305604053,"Without a doubt, my favorite year of the ""Attitude Era"" was the year of 1998.  It was that year that had more important landmarks, best storylines in my opinion, and rise of various superstars who would be some of the most important talent during not only this era but of all time.

Royal Rumble:
The Royal Rumble usually beings the ""Road To WrestleMania"" but this year's event revolved around two specific people with one of them Mike Tyson was in attendance watching the show from the a skybox as they revealed that there was negotiations between himself & WWE for him to be apart of WrestleMania in some capacity.  The other person was ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin as for weeks leading into the PPV, he was attacking other participants in the Royal Rumble match since he felt he was a marked man himself which played out in the Rumble match itself as everyone targeted him at some point including the action just stopping in the ring when it was time for Austin to join the match.  Other highlights of the Rumble include the hardcore start of the match, what happened between Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett, the Nation truly showing that it's every man for himself, and the ""3 Faces Of Foley.""  The other important match on this card was the Casket Match for the WWE Championship with Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker in a match that was notorious for two things in Kane's involvement in the match while Shawn Michaels taking the fall onto the casket that would cause him to retire from the ring for the next 4 four years.  Other matches include Vader vs. Artist Formerly Known As Goldust, a six man tag featuring the midget wrestlers from Mexico with Sunny as the referee, Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, and WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom.

WrestleMania XIV:
""The Austin Era Has Begun!"" is the one line of the night that this event is known for as the main event saw WWE Champion Shawn Michaels (in what would be his final match until 2002) vs. Steve Austin with the special outside enforcer being Mike Tyson (who Austin not only got into a confrontation with on RAW months earlier but also recently joined Michaels' faction of D-Generation X) in the match that would make Austin the top guy & eventually the highest grossing box office attraction in WWE history according to them.  Other matches include the match that was nearly year long story between Undertaker & his brother Kane finally happened here as well in a classic with the bonus WrestleMania moment of what happened to Pete Rose before the match, Cactus Jack & Chainsaw Charlie (Terry Funk) in a Dumpster Match against WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws that saw many crazy bumps in-front of the crowd & backstage, Legion Of Doom returning to the WWE for the 15 Team Battle Royal under the new persona of L.O.D. 2000 complete with a new look & manager, Triple H defending the European Championship against Owen Hart with Chyna handcuffed to Commissioner Slaughter at ringside, Sable's in-ring debut in a mixed tag match with Marc Mero vs. Artist Formerly Known As Goldust & Luna, a rare Light Heavyweight Championship defense by Taka Michinoku vs. Aguila, and The Rock defends the Intercontinental Championship against Ken Shamrock with another bonus of The Rock doing a backstage interview before the match where he was quoted for the first time saying his popular catchphrase ""if you smell what I'm cookin'.""

King Of The Ring:
While this yearly PPV is known for the traditional tournament to crown a new King Of The Ring which is usually the stepping stone to elevate that talent in a main event superstar, this years even is always remembered for the Hell In A Cell match between Undertaker vs. Mankind where Mick Foley's career changed forever based off the punishment he took in this match from being thrown off the cell & through the cell & onto thumbtacks that it's still the top ""Oh My God!...Holy Crap!"" moment in WWE history.  WWE Champion Steve Austin defended his championship against Kane in a First Blood Match that had the unique stipulation added to it that Kane would set himself on fire if he didn't win the championship with the match becoming a wild brawl that saw the Hell In A Cell coming into play various times along with appearances from the other personalities involved in this feud as well.  The traditional tournament this year only had the semi-finals shown with Ken Shamrock vs. Jeff Jarrett & The Rock vs. Dan Severn with the winners meeting in the finals later that night.  Other matches include Headbangers & Taka Michinoku vs. Kaientai; Al Snow fighting for a WWE contract with ""Head"" against Too Much; X-Pac vs. Owen Hart; and New Age Outlaws defending the WWE Tag Team Titles against New Midnight Express.

SummerSlam:
This event was subtitled ""Highway To Hell"" (complete with the AC/DC song) as the story between Undertaker & Steve Austin that had been building for months finally lead to the match here for the WWE Championship with the addition twist being revealed a week earlier that Kane & Undertaker had now aligned themselves together and pay attention during the match where Austin was actually knocked out for a few moments.  The other main event was for the Intercontinental Championship as the leader of The Nation in The Rock faced off against the leader of D-Generation X Triple H in a Ladder Match that wasn't full of high spots more than it was just a fight with both men using the ladder to make their moves more impact & dish out punishment.  Other matches include Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart with Dan Severn in his corner in the first ever Lion's Den Match where they competed in a MMA-style caged octagon; Edge's PPV debut in a mixed tag match with Sable vs. Marc Mero & Jacqueline; X-Pac vs. Jeff Jarrett in a Hair Match; European Champion D'Lo Brown vs. Val Venis; and a handicap tag team match with Oddities vs. Kaientai.

Survivor Series:
For the second time in history (first being WrestleMania IV), a tournament would determine who would be the new WWF Champion. There were a bunch of issues between going into this tournament between not only the participants themselves but also with Mr. McMahon himself (who was in a wheelchair at the time) as Big Boss Man had returned to be Mr. McMahon's personal bodyguard, his son Shane had turned against his father only to be downgraded to being a referee, Mankind had aligned himself with Mr. McMahon to the point where he received a corporate makeover, Steve Austin was still out for revenge after being screwed out of his championship, and The Rock also had something to prove due to Vince taking his aggression for the people out on ""The People's Champion.""  The finals of the tournament came down to Rock vs. Mankind in a match where both men turned up the intensity only for Mr. McMahon to crown his ""Corporate Champion"" in the end.  Another important match in the tournament was the semi-final round match between Mankind vs. Steve Austin where Austin literally beat the pants off Mankind before Mr. McMahon revealed his master plan to once again screw someone at Survivor Series.  Other tournament matches include Mankind vs. the mystery opponent picked by Mr. McMahon in Dwayne Gill (the future Gillberg); Al Snow vs. Jeff Jarrett; Steve Austin vs. Big Boss Man; X-Pac vs. Steven Regal; Goldust vs. Ken Shamrock; The Rock vs. Big Boss Man in a record setting win; Undertaker vs. Kane; Al Snow vs. Mankind in a match that J.R. described as ""Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fyne, Dr. Howard"" when it came to Mr. Socko & Head; The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock; and The Rock vs. Undertaker.  Other matches include Sable challenging Jacqueline for the Womens Championship & a triple threat match with Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. The Nation vs. Headbangers.

1998 is my favorite year of the ""Attitude Era"" as this collection features so many memorable moments from the final matches from Shawn Michaels for the rest of the decade, ""The Austin Era Has Begun"", the evolution of Vince McMahon into Mr. McMahon, the dominance of D-Generation X, the rise of The Rock, Mick Foley's leap into immortality, the story of Undertaker & Kane, matches that were not just memorable for the action but also the long term storyline going into the match like the ""Highway To Tell"" & the Austin/McMahon feud, and the rise of many mid-card talents (Ken Shamrock, Owen Hart, D'Lo Brown, Sable).  This is a must have collection in my eyes...at least for those who still have VHS players.",1343520000,,8478,4.745244565217392
