416269,5,6302032229,"If you like a well-done Western, you'll enjoy this one.  It has everything - train robberies, shoot outs, Outlaws, Indians, bad guys, heroes, strong women and strong men, romance and a touch of humor.  It's too bad Burt Reynolds didn't choose more movies roles like this.  He plays the part very well and Sara Miles is enchanting as the strong-willed Catherine. And what Western would be complete without Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden?  Look for an amazingly well done performance by (of all people) George Hamilton.

Now - I only wish Warner would put it out on DVD!",1144972800,29,565,4.666666666666667

416442,4,6302032229,"""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"" was not critically a success when it was released in 1973, but looking at it today thanks to Warner Archive, it had a lot going for it then and plays out better now.  The biggest advantage has always been Marilyn Durham's funny and touching, completely entertaining novel which was a bestseller.  Burt Reynolds was perfect casting as Jay Grobart as well as Sarah Miles having been the star of David Lean's ""Ryan's Daughter"" in 1970 as the strong-willed Catherine Crocker.  The producers Martin Poll and Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenplay, a perfect candidate after working along with her one-time husband, Frank Perry on such women's lib offerings as 1970's ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" knew they had a great package for screen entertainment.  Richard C. Sarafian was set to direct having done the cult favorite, 1971's ""Vanishing Point"" after 1970's ""Fragment of Fear"" with David Hemmings.  John Williams composed the wonderful score after one by Michel Legrand was rejected.  Perhaps it was with Sarafian that the film did not measure up with its potential.  The big-screen intimacies of the characters in the novel are missing in the translation and the film even had a more uplift ending than in the book.  But looking at it today, one can not help but appreciate it as a western of substantial merit.",1316131200,,1341,4.902654867256637
416443,5,6302032229,"Well I have waited for this movie for simply ages. What a delight to finally get it. I do enjoy westerns and certainly Cat Dancing is a western. I enjoy romance, and certainly this is a tender love story. I enjoy magnificent scenery. it abounds in this panoramic movie. Above all I enjoy being entertained and good acting, which is sorely missing in the modern movie, with special effects and staged scenes dominating the screen today.
The story is simple of Cat Dancing, so there is nothing special about it. Train robber (Burt Reynolds) takes hostage (Sarah Miles) who is in the wrong place at the ""right"" time and runs. Posse, led by Lee J Cobb (Wells Fargo representative)and wealthy, angry, possesive husband (George Hamilton)give chase.
There are cowboys, Indians and cavalry. The makings of an average western? No definitely not!
The characters are intense and one gets propelled into a world of greed, wrath, hate, heartache, despair, love, adventure and more. The cast is incredibly well put together and the acting is excellent. For me this is one of Burt Reynolds best efforts as an actor. Sarah Miles is perfect as the wealthy lady who gets caught in a chain of events that take her from velvet riding habits to miners clothing.
If you enjoy a western with a human relationship theme running through it this is the one for you.
If you enjoy a western with good acting and direction impacting on the overall effect - this is for you.
If you enjoy a western that entetains from beginning to end - this is definitely for you.
The only down side to the copy of the DVD that I received was that 45 minutes into the movie it stuck. I was able to forward wind and bypass this section - lost about 10 minutes of movie - so was able to see the rest of the movie after all. Also there are no special features which for such an expensive DVD is a pity as today one has become accustomed to the little extras. They may have made up for the hic up in the middle of the movie.
Overall however I am pleases to have this product in my collection.",1297382400,3,2042,4.477211796246649
416444,4,6302032229,"Hello,

Although I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing this movie several times I still cannot fathom what occurred when the movie was being filmed etc. Sarah Miles agent and possible lover became jealous, and supposedly abused her when they were together in her room. Sarah enlisted the support and protection of Burt Reynolds whom I am sure murdered the individual and made it seem as if it was drug related. The guy was badly beaten up and pills were scattered all over the room with a coroner stating that he died from a drug overdose ? Sure ? Mr. Reynolds denied murdering the guy and said that he was only concerned for Sarah's safety ? Shame on you Burt Reynolds !",1296864000,2,666,4.55

The story in a nutshell: an abused wife trying to escape her husband accidentally encounters a group of train robbers also on the run.  The outlaws' leader has a secret from his past that he hopes the swag from the robbery will help fix.  The photography and scenery are great, as is Elmer Bernstein's score.  Reynolds and Sarah Miles are both ideal in their roles, despite the occasional line of sappy dialogue.  Jack Warden is memorable as a thoroughly evil villain and George Hamilton as the abandoned husband is properly devoid of feeling except when he's causing someone else pain.  There's action a-plenty and while not a milestone in the Western genre, is still worth a viewing.",1296086400,,774,4.7819548872180455

416448,4,6302032229,"Sometimes you watch a film with disinterest and by its conclusion are suddenly captivated and charmed. ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing,"" an oddly named 1973 western romance (based on the early 1970's bestseller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Loved-Cat-Dancing/dp/B000OUK5G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing</a>&nbsp;by Marilyn Durham), is one of those films. It's practically forgotten today, with faded stars breathing life into a western genre dying fast. One of the beauties of the Internet is the ability to investigate a movie's back story, and this one certainly had a troubled production including changes in directors and musical composers, plus Sarah Miles' assistant committing suicide.

There's an undeniable chemistry between stars Burt Reynolds and Miles, and through all the on-set controversy, they carve interesting performances rivaling the best work of their unique careers. It's an engaging, if implausible, oater as aristocratic wife Catherine Crocker (Miles) decides to run away from her wealthy husband (George Hamilton). She stumbles upon a train robbery where she's kidnapped by the motley outlaws and forced to travel cross-country through the desert. They are doggedly tracked by a posse, led by a salt-of-the-earth sheriff (Lee J. Cobb) and, of course, the unusually foppish husband.

Miles sleeps next to campfires, avoiding rape on a nightly basis. The leader of the crew is, of course, Reynolds, a soft-hearted man with a past who eventually becomes Miles' protector, sparking their slowly budding romance. This was an interesting performance for Reynolds at an important phase of his career, post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/6305558159/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>&nbsp;and pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokey-and-the-Bandit-Special-Edition/dp/B000EQHXOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition</a>. He has undeniable physical presence, adorned in beard and dusty clothes, usually chomping a cigar. While Reynolds eventually fell into mostly comedic roles, this was a rare opportunity to play a brooding man of action, and he displays an appealing confidence on the level of Clint Eastwood.

Miles, with doe eyes and stubborn disposition, almost steals the film with an enormously sympathetic performance that, under the right circumstances, could have garnered an Oscar nomination. An eccentric free spirit in real life, the behind-the-scenes controversy of her assistant committing suicide (while Miles' husband Robert Bolt was in England, she was having a sporadic affair with her assistant and, in a jealous rage over time spent with Reynolds, he evidently took sleeping pills) had much to do with fans ignoring this film. Original director Brian Hutton also dropped out to be replaced by Richard C. Sarafian (hot off the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanishing-Point/dp/B00013RC8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanishing Point</a>). In addition, producers publicly clashed over the screenplay and, finally, a very young John Williams (pre-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;super-stardom) was carted in overnight to write a subtle but likable score (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Loved-Cat-Dancing/dp/B0006SSQ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing</a>&nbsp;- arguably one of his best) after the original composer's work was rejected. It was a turbulent production.

Through it all, you have the extraordinary cinematography of veteran Harry Stradling, Jr., taking full advantage of the colorful locales of Arizona and Utah. A fine supporting cast, including Jack Warden and Bo Hopkins in villainous form, and Cobb as Sheriff Lapchance, deliver unique dialog most likely lifted straight from Durham's novel. Warden, especially, displays uneasy menace as one of the more sadistic villains to be found in a western. Many criticize ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"" because of its harsh violence, with fights to the death, rape and one brutal sequence where a man is shot in the groin, though granted it was poetic justice. Ultimately, I believe, the frontier violence is an intense contrast to the tender Reynolds/Miles romance, as they find love in the most unlikely places.

There are extreme missteps in this film, including the miscasting of Hamilton in a crucial role. Filmmakers also chose to have Reynolds shave his beard about two-thirds in so we have the famous mustache, giving him a far-too-urban look when all that had come before was intentionally rustic. Burt was giving a fine performance (one of the five best of his career, along with ""Deliverance,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boogie-Nights/dp/B000PAAJZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boogie Nights</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starting-Over/dp/B0008KLVBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starting Over</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-In/dp/B00005V9HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking In</a>) and there was no need to revert to sex symbol pop persona. When the dust finally clears, we have a flawed but touching film. Perhaps cursed by history, this gently engrossing work is deserving of discovery, with a unique beauty if in the right frame of mind.",1271462400,14,5696,6.851034482758621
