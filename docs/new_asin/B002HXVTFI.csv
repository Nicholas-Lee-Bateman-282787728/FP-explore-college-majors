In MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY (Donald F. Glut, 2006), an aging museum curator (Kylie Wyote) gets spurned by two beautiful women (Stacy Burke; Cindy Pucci) and decides to extract revenge by use of an ancient spell to reanimate a Mummy from the days of the Pharoahs.  She maintains this Mummy's ""afterlife"" by delivering to its goddess (Andrea Smith) the ""kas,"" or life energies, of several beautiful women, starting with the two that spurned her.  A plucky reporter (Christina Nguyen), looking for a story to sell to her tabloid newspaper, stumbles into this plot, and when the curator runs afoul the goddess herself, the reporter Elise (Lam) gets caught in the middle.  Will anybody be able to stop Dr. Zita (Wyote) before Elise becomes a victim?  That's the movie in a nutshell.

MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY, is a ""sexploitation"" film in the truest sense - it's a B movie whose primary focus is showing us beautiful women in various states of undress, and this movie has the beautiful women part in spades.  Besides Nguyen, Burke, Pucci, and Andrea Smith, the biggest find for me were the Potter twins, who play handmaidens, a throwback to my favorite sexy act of the past twenty years, the now aging and defunct Morrell twins.  Like the Morrells, the Potter twins are busty, spend this entire film topless, and fun to look at it.  So this movie has it covered from every angle in the girl department.  More importantly, its director, Donald Glut, is a veteran of the sexploitation genre, and like all of the great sexploitation filmmakers (Russ Meyer, Roger Corman, William Castle, Dave Friedman, Andy Sidaris, et. al), there is a method to his madness.  There are dozens of references to old Universal and Hammer monster movies in this film, particularly the Mummy ones, appropriately enough, and in this way, the movie also pays homage to the history of its own genre.  At the same time, the production design is beautiful - four color and glossy, just like I like it, with the makeup effects and wardrobe matching everything to a ""t"".  MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY even has some cgi, just enough to make it a little better than a pure low budget feature.  Like the best B movies, it's a lot of fun, and I really dug the Hell out of it.  Definitely recommended if you're into this genre.

My only criticism would be in the story.  Believe it or not, there is an art to making a sexploitation movie, and that centers around the fact that what makes a movie like this sexy is that it has enough story to keep it somewhat believeable, at least believeable enough to pay off the sex.  That is to say, the difference between a sexploitation film and, say, a _Playboy_ video is that the _Playboy_ video has no story - it's just a visual depiction of beautiful women in the nude.  A sexploitation movie has a story so that your imagination can somehow make the sex more real - the goal is for the audience to fantasize that this could be really happening, ideally, to them, within the context of the fantasy universe, and for this reason, I felt that the half-assed working of the supernatural part fell a bit short.  Zita steals women's kas, and then she decides that she's going to defy the goddess by what?  Stealing a /ton/ of kas?!  It didn't make a Heullva lot of sense.  A sharper story would have been to say something like she's going to turn Elise into a mummy or something, thus replacing the original Mummy and taking control of it for herself.  The logical strain on the Mummy bit wears thin after a while, making the ending somewhat unsatisfying to me.  I wish it had been cleaned up better.  (And the stuff with the guy (Mark Bedell) being attracted to Elise to the point that his secretary (Yuu Asakura) tries to imitate her to attract him totally falls flat.  When we see the secretary, it feels like he's some sleaze who keeps Asian girls around because he's a pervert, so when Elise kisses him later, it totally comes out of left field).

Still, the fact of the matter is this: Exploitation movie making, to me, is the purest kind of filmmaking there is, because it's unapologetic about what it is, and as a result, there are no restrictions on what it can do, besides the logistics of budget and whatnot.  With no studio to dictate content, it's free to be as sexy or scary or ridiculous as it wants to be.  And I've always felt that exploitation filmmakers were having the most fun making movies.  It should come as no surprise, then, that everybody involved in this film seems to be having the time of their lives, and as a result, it's a lot of fun for us, the audience, too.  MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY is a sexy, fun little film that will give anybody who's into this sort of thing exactly what they paid for.  On a scale of one to ten, it's an eight at least.  Check it out.",1266192000,5,4836,4.552601156069364

8370586,4,B002HXVTFI,"Way too many of these ""sexploitation videos"" are hastily slapped together by talentless hacks who have zero erotic imagination, and the girl/girl scenes included show it, as the women are clearly doing nothing more than going through the motions.  But I've got to credit director Donald Glut with actually including at least one really HOT scene in this video!  First of all, Belinda Gavin is a SUPERB CHOICE to play museum curator Zita, a predatory lesbian who is able to control a long-dead-mummy to do her nefarious bidding.  There's a GREAT scene where she has her mummy kidnap beautiful young blonde Stacey Burke and bring the unwilling girl to her at the museum after hours!  Belinda is clearly attracted to Stacey's gorgeous young body, and when the hostile girl refuses to cooperate she uses hypnotism to bend her to her will!  The scene that follows is HOT, and anything-but-mechanical, as Belinda slowly enjoys fondling and caressing her lovely young captive, at one point even kissing Stacey's luscious butt!  That one encounter made this DVD a satisfying purchase for me!  Well done, Director Glut!  And well done, Belinda & Stacey!  You two were HOT together!",1441411200,4,1172,5.0

8370588,4,B002HXVTFI,"Don Glut delivers a fun little horror flick filled with silicone-filled ladies and a female mummy being manipulated to capture victims to allow a female scientist to keep her youth. It features three friends of mine, Kylie Wyote and Christine Nguyen. Writer, director, producer Don Glut delivers some good puns.",1387152000,3,311,5.24
8370589,4,B002HXVTFI,"Based on the cover alone, there were not many expectations for this movie beyond lots of nudity.  The film did not disappoint in that regard.  During the open credits, two twins (who turn out to be an ancient Egyptians godesses handmaidens) with really large boob-jobs just kinda move around.  So you know where this film is going.
The story, as much as it is, starts with a showing of a ancient Egyptian collection including a mummy.  You would think that a collection of artifacts like that would draw more than 10 people, which includes a weird scholar, a couple of lipstick lesbians, and of course the beautiful Christine Nguyen.  She plays a reporter who works for a trash newspaper trying to get a story on the  mummy attacking people.
Zita (Belinda Gavin), the museum curator, is concerned with growing old.  She uses a necklace to get help from the goddess Nephthys (Andrea Smith), another ancient Egyptian with big, fake boobs.  She gets control of the mummy who kidnaps all of the beautiful girls at the party to steal their lifeforce to keep herself young.
The majority of the story is just an excuse to get the girls naked.  Somehow, Zita has to have lesbian sex with the girls before she can steal their lifeforce.  If you are just looking for lots of naked girls and soft core lesbian sex, this is the movie for you.",1375747200,,1330,4.621276595744681
8370590,1,B002HXVTFI,"Well, I just finished watching ""Mummy's Kiss"". I want to preface what I say about it by saying that I'm a fan of bad movies. This must be the worst thing I've ever seen. It does excel in several categories. It is the worst acting I've ever seen, the worst dialogue I've ever heard, the worst boob jobs I've ever seen and the worst sex scenes I've ever seen. I mean really, I LIKE bad movies and I often scoff at reviewers who would even approach writing about something like this from an artistic standpoint. If you are like me, this probably won't prevent you from buying it but it's not even funny bad, you know, like being able to see the strings holding up the ""monsters"" in Japanese films like ""Mothra meets Godzilla"", I can get into stuff like that. This is the first time I've written about a movie because when the credits ran, I couldn't even believe that anyone would own up to this. Maybe they aren't their real names. Now Christy Nguyen or whatever her name is is attractive enough, and she does get naked, but it's not anywhere near enough to make this worthwhile watching.

If I prevent one person from wasting their money on ""Mummy's Kiss"" I'll feel good about my life. I find it hard to believe that Frontline entertainment could find even one reason to make this thing.",1342051200,5,1286,4.4491525423728815
8370591,1,B002HXVTFI,"The first thing I saw with abject disgust were huge, fake looking breast that never looked real and went out of style quickly.  I had hoped that there would be something about Mummy's in this DVD but all it was tasteless, trashy PORNO.  GOD, what huge, silicone filled breasts.  They caused me to feel nausius.  I threw the DVD in my trash can after less than five minutes viewing.  GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH.  In this case, bigger isn't better!",1330905600,3,448,4.5375
8370592,2,B002HXVTFI,"Definitely not a family film, not much of a thriller, and yet not exactly qualified to be considered porn either.  When you purchase a movie sight unseen, regardless of how many reviews you read, you realize not everybody has the same tastes in humor, erotica, politics, sports, religion, or defines effective styles of management exactly the same either.  So it's a gamble, a crap shoot, like skydiving from above heavy cloud cover.  Could be just about anything on the other side.
""The Mummy's Kiss"" is a softcore flick from the 1970's era, back there before all of America knew the depth of corruption in Washington D.C., because there was still some innocence and nave, Victorian prudes with enough influence to let us as a country be for the most part, sexually repressed and experience challenged; ergo, missionary position sex was pretty much the majority of opportunity for physically intimate people.  In contemporary times, bestiality, S&M, B&D, and nearly tortuous kinkiness have replaced the too tame and too old fashioned softcore mentality of the 1970's era.  It takes a hundred times as explicit nature subject material in today's comparative genre to have equal effect.  ""The Mummy's Kiss"" is kept at that 40 years ago easy-on-the-eyes frontier, without the heavy exploitation.
Two gorgeous blonde twenty-something women share intimacy privately together, with sweet, delicate and beautiful expression - including Hollywood's depiction of just a caress being enough to bring a luxuriously scintillating woman nearly to climax as she unconditionally gasps in delight.  Of course, next on the dessert cart is the stunning brunette's visually stimulating self-maintenance of her sumptuous mammary protuberances.  Now it's time for the stuffy, backed-up Egyptian museum curator who keeps her hair in a bun to make her neophyte pagan's prayer to Isis and Osiris, asking for the ancient beauty and everlasting life granted to Egyptian Queens be shared (fast forward, fast forward) and now we see more mammary protuberances displayed in the phantom vision and magic mist.  A couple of bathing pool scenes with female nudity includes a smattering of female on female frolic that almost makes you wish those women had actually attended acting school.
The story doesn't exist, the acting quality isn't even porn movie quality, you won't recognize anybody anywhere during this film not common exclusively to the porn film industry, and even though there's a foursome in this, a man is never part of the action sexually so I can't say this movie sucks, but it does lick.",1293840000,8,2574,5.213075060532687
8370593,4,B002HXVTFI,"I recently had the pleasure of watching the Frontline Entertainment feature, THE MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY. The film is written and directed by Donald F. Glut a director that many people might not recognize the name of, but definitely should! Mr. Glut has many titles under his belt, including BLOOD SCARAB, COUNTESS DRACULA'S ORGY OF BLOOD, and DINOSAUR VALLEY GIRLS just to name a few. Now, by the titles of these films, it is pretty obvious that we are not dealing with huge Hollywood produced films here. These are very small productions on very limited budgets. The difference between Mr. Glut's low budget films and other low budget films, though, is that they don't look low budget. THE MUMMY'S KISS: 2ND DYNASTY is a beautifully shot film with some great makeup/special effects. The mummy itself looks great and very gross...just like a 3000 year old mummy should!
This was a very fun movie to watch. The acting was good for the most part, and the story was a lot of fun. The actresses in the film are some of the most beautiful you will see in any film. Please be warned though, the film does contain a lot of sexual situations and nudity. In fact, if I had to find any faults with the film, it might have been that it contains a little too much nudity for a horror film, something I never thought I would say! While obviously shot quick and on a cheap budget, the film did something that some big budget Hollywood films don't do, and that is it kept me entertained the full running time. And really, that is all a good movie is supposed to do. This movie proves it doesn't take a multimillion budget to make a good movie.",1266883200,10,1631,4.513513513513513
