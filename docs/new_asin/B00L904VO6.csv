8664493,5,B00L904VO6,An interesting and enjoyable double disc DVD set about Bowie's early years and how he became the performer he was destined to become. Very good archive film footage throughout.,1454284800,3,176,5.103448275862069
8664494,3,B00L904VO6,The second disc was nice because it was Bowie interviews. The rest was terrible video quality edited poorly and unauthorized from a lot of People he no longer deals with.,1421107200,9,170,4.7

8664497,1,B00L904VO6,"Product description should feature prominently that ""Becoming Bowie"" is not authorized by the artist, his record label, or management.  This information is not listed on the Amazon website, but is written in bold on the back of the DVD package. Why do consumers only learn this important information upon receipt of the DVD?  While I could only bare watching about 10-15 minutes, I found the DVD largely unwatchable.  The filmed interviews are poorly lit with bizarre camera angels and often shot in some random suburban living room.  The low production value of this DVD is not on par with standards one associates with David Bowie.  I was really looking forward to receiving this DVD and was incredibly disappointed.",1411257600,19,718,5.0508474576271185
