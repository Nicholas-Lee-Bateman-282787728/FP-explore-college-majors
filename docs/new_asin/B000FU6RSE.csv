8126798,5,B000FU6RSE,"When I saw some of the making of this film from a video uploaded on YouTube, I couldn't wait to see it. It looked like a Chinese ""Moulin Rouge,"" which is a movie I love. I was upset when I saw the disclaimer about the DVD possibly not playing on most U.S. DVD players, but I had to give it a try. Luckily, it plays on mine (FYI: I have a Pioneer). It froze about 5-10 times throughtout watching, but I just pressed ""Stop"" and then ""Play,"" which seemed to do the trick. Although the movie offers subtitles, so far it looks like there won't be English subtitles for the Special Features on Disc one, and disc two wouldn't play for me (so far on 1st try). Anyway, the movie's very interesting the way the story revolves around a movie being made and that its story, basically, mirrors the real-life story of the actors & director involved etc. What else can I say? I know--that I'm totally in love with Takeshi Kaneshiro!",1184457600,,918,4.343023255813954
8126799,5,B000FU6RSE,"This movie succeeded. The elements and what it's trying to do are good enough, but what is so wonderful about this film is that it comes together into an intimate, nice fit. The stars are sensational. The plot calls on the supporting players to rise to sensational performances as well, and I never saw anyone falling short. The piece is as seemless and fun as art should be, and -- give it up! -- it's a musical, a Chinese musical! However it all works, it does, so reward yourself with this. It's worth buying a multiregional player just so you can see the version with special features. There is a growing body of first-rate Chinese cinema and this movie has a special place in its firmament.",1167782400,3,695,4.523809523809524
8126800,4,B000FU6RSE,"Peter Chan's Perhaps Love is an intriguing Chinese/Hong Kong/Malaysian backstage musical built around the notion of life as a movie where we constantly edit our memories and that, while we are all the leading players in our personal movie, we're no more than bit parts rather than co-stars in anybody else's and that consequently life is full of abandoned subplots and deleted footage. With the huge amount of mutual crossover between local pop stars and Hong Kong movies, it's surprising there have been so few movie musicals from that part of the world, but they're thin enough on the ground for this to be marketed as the first Chinese musical in 40 years. Only it's not 'really' a musical - like most modern musicals, it tries to disguise the fact it's a musical by setting its drama against the making of a movie musical as Takeshi Kaneshiro has to come to terms with the fact that the great love of his life (Zhao Xun, excellent in a virtual dual role) has completely edited him out of her memory because to her the past is only useful as a reminder of what to get away from. Her present is Jacky Cheung's director with Fellini syndrome (he can't see what he really wants to do with his film), and she's already rewriting that relationship in expectation of a Hollywood deal. Through it all wanders Ji Jin-hee's angelic keeper of discarded footage, an occasional observer rather than an active participant.

Hong Kong's failed official entry for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, it's a lavishly mounted affair, with beautiful photography and great design. There are some visual influences from Jacques Demy (most notably an overhead shot of multi-coloured umbrellas) and more overtly in the circus scenes Moulin Rouge, although thankfully the musical numbers are much better shot than Luhrman's effort, and without resorting to excessive ADDS editing. Peter Kam's songs may occasionally sound a little odd to Western ears (although the HK DVD thankfully subtitles the lyrics, a rarity in musicals), but they're surprisingly impressive and memorable, and for the most part well-served by the cast. Kaneshiro may have the face of an angel but he also has the singing voice of Lee Marvin, although since his songs aren't written for a trained voice that's not a major problem. However, Jacky Cheung is quite a revelation to anyone only aware of his work as an actor - not only does he have the strongest voice among the cast, but its the one that puts the real emotional power into his numbers. Its appeal to Western audiences is probably limited to fans of Wong Kar-Wei's brand of morally compromised romanticism, although this is not as exhilarating or daring as the best of Wong, it has more than enough imagination and emotional resonance of its own to make it well worth checking out.

Extras on the 2-disc special edition are making of documentary, 2 Bollywood Dancers clips, 2 music montages, B-roll footage, teaser trailer and full theatrical trailer - all in unsubtitled Chinese. The feature has good English subtitles.",1164672000,4,3027,4.898635477582846
