8045883,4,B00078NISQ,Fun. I enjoyed watching Battlebots on TV.,1515542400,,41,5.0
8045884,4,B00078NISQ,"I loved BattleBots when I was little and was super excited when I saw this video. It's great and I loved the battles in it. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of Y2K2, the creepy Monkey robot. I prefer the lights to start a BattleBots battle. Otherwise great Purchase and worth your money.",1503187200,,299,4.2631578947368425

8045886,1,B00078NISQ,"I would give this four or five stars because it covered the bouts very well but it wouldn't work on ANY of my 3 DVD players.  I live in USA, but I could only get it to play on my computer, otherwise I wouldn't be able to see it.  This was a big disppointment.  Just to let you know, if it doesn't play when you get it.",1468886400,,318,3.716417910447761
