8416648,4,B000OVGBBW,"This dvd is by an amatuer. Let's make that clear right up front. That being said, it delivers exactly what it says- waterfalls, lots of them, from Wisconsin.

I enjoy this dvd just fine. If you are a video snob, don't bother; this video lacks the slick and polished production videophiles can't handle being without. It appears to have been done just by some guy who hiked out into the woods with an ordinary camcorder. But I was just looking for something to use as a pleasant background while reading or such. It works just fine for that, and there are lots of truly beautiful shots.

There are only two things that I find a bit distracting. One is that the shots change every 15 seconds. The other is that the shots that attempt a panning motion tend to jerk a bit. Neither is a big deal if you're just glancing at it now and then.

My 6 year old just loves it to settle down at night. She's very bouncy and can be difficult to put to bed. We watched it together when it arrived, oohing and aaahing over the pretty water. The next night she surprised me by asking for it! The beauty of the waterfalls and the rushing sound of the water provides just what she needs to relax and get sleepy. The frequency of the shot changes is actually an advantage here, because the scene changes often enough to keep her attention until the rushing sound of the water has a chance to work its magic.

Definitely worth having as long as you understand it didn't come out of a Hollywood movie studio. Even with the amateur quality, this dvd has become a real family favorite; we watch it several times a week!",1178409600,2,1595,4.36026936026936
