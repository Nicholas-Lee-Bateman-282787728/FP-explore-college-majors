5860693,4,B00DW5ILJC,4 Stars... Not because it was decent movie but that it's so bad it's a laugh.  It's rare to find a lousy movie that's actually a crack up.,1381622400,,138,3.9285714285714284
5860694,5,B00DW5ILJC,"WOWW! Really enjoyed this excellent little halloween horror film. somewhat like the earlier released film: the bates haunting, and had alot of the same scenes and location. First of all the filming and scenery were fantastic, and the acting by the cast was top notch. the actresses were very attractive and did a super job with there lines and acting. the film was alright with some very gruesome scenes and could have been better with scary frightening scenes. there were a couple of very provocative (peeping tom) scenes and a scene of a guy witnessing a coven of black dressed witches that were enticing, especially the love making scene of the couple, where the beautiful witch (dressed in some very sheer black undies) makes love to this lucky guy! Really liked watching each of the actresses, they were very pleasing to the eyes. I will definitely add this to my collection. Overall a great film that would be liked by couples with nothing better to do than sit at home watching movies.",1381449600,2,992,4.773255813953488
5860695,1,B00DW5ILJC,"I have waited a while for this movie to come out, and I can say it was NOT worth the wait. Very,very  diasppointing. Good acting in it, but the movie was just not good. I love Halloween horror movies, and I also love low budget movies, I am not picky ! but still this movie was just a joke. Just did not make much sense to me. I was sitting watching it like umm ok ? kept hoping for it to get better ( sometimes movies do ) but this one did not.",1381276800,9,445,3.78494623655914
5860696,2,B00DW5ILJC,"It might just be me, but this movie gave me a feeling of deja vu. I think the writers had recently watched the original Prom Night.
This movie has the right amount of gore, nudity and interesting kill scenes.
And Tiffany Shepis is hot as always...but completely underused in the flick.
But somehow, the movie still sucks.
I love horror flicks, even stupid horror flick can be entertaining. but this attempt is just pathetic.
Is it too much to ask for a decent horror movie these days?",1380844800,9,484,4.574712643678161
5860697,1,B00DW5ILJC,"THis movie went under the title Bates Haunting. You cant tell me this isn't the same movie just under a different title. I mean same theme in the Bates Haunting, girls friend gets killed then the next year she goes to work for the BATES FARM. I mean wtf? Two loq budget flicks ripping off the name BATES? With the same theme? Check out what I'm talking about here

5860708,4,B00DW5ILJC,"If you ever had a crime commuted against you and the people got away with the go crime, then you'll love this movie. I loved it and recommend it, ""get back at the bad guys"", it felt just so good!",1439596800,3,195,3.9
5860709,1,B00DW5ILJC,"Despite actress Danielle Harris (who is always great), this is a home-made piece of garbage that you probably couldn't even sit all the way through if your best friend made it. It's like someone got a $20 camera for their birthday and decided they were going to make a movie with all of their friends, who have never actually seen an actor... or a movie... in their entire lives. Don't waste your money. I could've fed a starving kid in Africa for the $4 I lost on this. I'm considering seppuku for the shame I've brought to myself by renting this.",1434844800,,548,4.435643564356436

5860711,5,B00DW5ILJC,"This movie was ok but I think Danielle Harris should have been the main character, Eve.",1429574400,,87,4.5
5860712,1,B00DW5ILJC,"This movie is as lame as it is cheap, save your money and do something more fun , like cleaning your bathroom . I gave it one star only because I really like Danielle Harris , unfortunately she's not in it that much .",1427673600,2,217,3.9545454545454546
5860713,5,B00DW5ILJC,"GREAT FILM , IF YOU LIKE BLOODY FILMS ITS A 7 WORTH THE BUY AT 10 BUCKS",1424563200,,71,3.235294117647059
5860714,1,B00DW5ILJC,"This was ridiculously bad. Firstly, how did nobody notice the huge issue with timelines? Eve is tormented as a young child by a bunch of teens and has an accident. Ten years later the children of these teens, now college students, are being stalked and killed. How did each of these teens (maybe 15-16 at the start of the movie) end up with college freshmen aged children (Played by obvious thirty somethings) in ten years? Eve appears to be only ten years older but the tens, now adults who tormented her are somehow twenty years older.
Add to this the really bad acting, I mean REALLY BAD and the cheap, REALLY CHEAP, special effects and the overdone story line that is unbelievably predictable, and you end up with one of the worst movies ever made.
I want to give it a negative star review",1418601600,,793,4.513888888888889
5860715,2,B00DW5ILJC,"This movie has a lot of wasted potential. It had a great setting and beloved scream queen Danielle Harris, but neither was enough to save this film. The acting is below average even by low budget horror standards. The special effects were clearly done on a budget, so I tried to forgive their cheesiness. The worst part is that the movie ends up being confusing. Too many of the actresses look and sound alike, making it impossible to tell them apart. The ending makes absolutely no sense and lacks any explanation about why there was a 10 year build up to the massacre. Danielle Harris was the best part of the movie, but she wasn't given nearly enough screen time. I'd say skip this one or just rent it.",1414368000,,705,4.4728682170542635
5860716,5,B00DW5ILJC,Great slasher film. Movie arrived promptly. Very pleased with my purchase.,1413158400,,74,5.818181818181818
5860717,5,B00DW5ILJC,"B movies are a dime a dozen but considering it takes place at the local (SE PA. ) Bates Haunted Hayride and has cameos by Tiffany Shepis and Danielle Harris, how could you possibly go wrong?",1406678400,,190,4.305555555555555
5860738,3,B00DW5ILJC,"I bought this movie thinking it would be a good slasher. From reading up on it I thought it sounded good. I also bought this because I was a huge Danielle Harris fan and I figured with her in the movie the movie would be at least average. I usually enjoy movies she is in. The main issue with the movie was the writing. The second issue was actors not being used properly. Harris and Shepis didn't get enough screen time. What bothered me is I thought those two should played different parts then they were playing that were bigger roles.

  The plot is years after a tragic accident leaves a young child scarred for life, the people responsible pay - with their lives. It's a story that had been done before many times. This time due to the writing I had trouble following the movie and guessing who the killer was. The gore was good. There was good action in the story. I thought the acting was very good for a horror movie. I thought Courtney Baxter did a good job as the woman had the scarred face from the accident. I liked her character and felt for her character. Ashley C Williams did good too. The actors all did good but the poorly written script hurt the movie severely. I think had it been better this could have been a really good slasher movie. I think the other as I said before Shepis and Harris having smaller parts was a mistake by the director. It was wasting good talent. If they were in the movie more they may have made it a better movie. They just missed the mark with this one.

  But in the end I recommend you rent this movie and not buy it unless you get it cheap. I think hardcore horror fans will enjoy it and I think new horror fans might be disappointed. Cheers!",1399420800,5,1693,4.258566978193146
5860739,3,B00DW5ILJC,The worse thing about this movie is the dialogue from some of the actors. It looks like the director let them freestyle it cuz they couldn't remember their lines or something. The script was weak but worked until the end it seemed rushed like they ran out of time or money. And there was no killing until like 30-40 mminutes in. But the gore was alright for a low budget movie there was some nudity and a couple cute chicks along with danielle harris. If you can get for less than 10 bucks go ahead it's nothing special but it kills 78 minutes,1398384000,,543,4.281553398058253
5860740,1,B00DW5ILJC,"I am not sure where to start.  I love scary movies and slasher flicks, but this was beyond dreadful.  I also have loved Danielle Harris since the Halloween films.  This movie was truly hard to watch.  The acting and the story were so very bad.",1396396800,,243,4.333333333333333
5860741,4,B00DW5ILJC,"i gave this movie 4 stars because it is a typical Halloween tale , it has Danielle Harris in it , the plot assures you that at the very least , you are going to get a good Halloween nite scare",1393804800,,192,3.707317073170732
5860742,5,B00DW5ILJC,really great movie could watch it over and over. good cast starting to become on of of my favorites.must watch,1384128000,,110,4.55
5860743,5,B00DW5ILJC,I enjoyed this film very much! Danielle Harris was GREAT!! Definitely recommend this to all those Danielle Harris fans!! Enjoy!,1383264000,2,127,5.4
5860744,4,B00DW5ILJC,"It is an 80s throwback in that the makers intended it not only as homage to 80s horrow, but to look like it was made in 1983.  From the background dime store synth soundtrack (because Carpenter used to score his own movies.)  to the metal track over the closing credits.

Others have done similar as have I in college, since it meshes with a  low budget.",1383004800,,354,4.318181818181818
5860745,3,B00DW5ILJC,"As a child Eve is teased by the older children which leads to a disfigurement accident. 10 years later the children who teased her are all together at a Halloween place known as the Bates farm not to be confused with the film ""The Bates Haunting"" also filmed in rural Pennsylvania. Eve (Courtney Baxter) manages to find a plastic surgeon who doesn't believe in skin grafts...ever. One by one.. oh heck you know the plot. It is a who dunnit, but we watch for the gore and girls.

There is some weird pot smoking scene which they either needed to do more of that kind of stuff or leave it alone entirely. The first mutilated dead face was pretty bad and made me laugh. The special effects needed to be taken to a higher plane. The dialouge needed to add to the character. As a stock slasher film it had potential, but will be content to run with the pack.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity",1383004800,2,890,4.387878787878788
5860746,1,B00DW5ILJC,"I just finished watching this movie, and I'm really sorry to say it's pretty bad. I love the slasher sub-genre, and long-time scream queen Danielle Harris is always a strong draw for horror fans, but there's not much to say about this movie that's good. Harris puts in a decent performance, but she barely has anything to do in the film. She's much better in the recently released ""Shiver"". Most of the actors in this one are beyond bad, and the effects are laughable. You'd be better off saving your money and time than wasting either on this one.",1382572800,2,548,4.545454545454546
5860747,1,B00DW5ILJC,"Awful. Poorly written with terrible dialogue that seems ad libbed at times, constant cussing, pot smoking, just all-around crappy script with not much going on. It was so bad that I couldn't tell if the actors were any good or not. They simply weren't given anything to work with. It wasn't remotely entertaining. I'm embarrassed for the fools who wrote and produced that...and for the actors, especially Danielle Harris.",1381708800,3,421,5.115942028985507

8598561,2,B00DW5ILJC,"I know for a fact that if this movie wasn't named Hallows Eve I would've never even gave it a second glance. I LOVE Halloween & will really watch just about any movie based around the holiday. I wouldn't say Hallows Eve is a great movie but it was OK.It's worth watching once but ONLY once. After watching it, I don't think it's a movie you'll watch ever again. For the budget it was made on, I think they did a pretty good job. The special effects were just gross. If you're into that sort of thing then you might like this movie. The thing that stood out the most for me in Hallows Eve was Stephen Medvidick. He was GREAT as the (I can't use the words I really want to here) stoner Rudy. His character was the type of guy you wonder why you're friends with him in the 1st place. I want to check out other movies he's been in now..Hallows Eve was a pretty decent movie but like I said before, I don't think it's a movie you'll watch more than once",1473724800,,948,4.102150537634409
8598562,1,B00DW5ILJC,Very poorly done. The only thing I liked was the mountain of dead heads.,1473206400,,72,4.214285714285714
8598563,4,B00DW5ILJC,"I found this to beentertaining. I buy all films that are Halloween based and all films with Tiffany Shepis. This was kinda like a revenge flick. Corny acting but good names,Danielle Harris is in it as well. The film is set on Halloween,the girl getting picked on gets facially damaged and 10 years later people involved get brutally murdered at the family farm. The blood pours and the humor is friggin funny. The end is kinda confusing but i watched it again and it makes sense. Great all the way around,i love the cheese factor and the fact they created an off kilter plot than the usual...but revenge is what every film is based on. I gotta say Tiffany Shepis had a small part but still good to see her in films that i enjoy. Get it if you like Halloween films and good corny acting with good gore and kills.",1471219200,,811,4.377483443708609
8598564,3,B00DW5ILJC,"There are 2 series of movies with a similar name coming out at about the same time: All Hallow's Eve and Hallow's Eve, so don't get confused. Hallow's Eve is your typical ""deformed teen who takes revenge"" movie. A girl has a messed up face and that really pisses some people close to her off. Nothing special going on here. Danielle Harris is criminally underused in this movie. It's pretty cheap so you might as well buy it instead of renting it in the case that you want to give it a second watch, but really there's no point. Average at best.",1463616000,3,545,4.352941176470588

8598566,1,B00DW5ILJC,I can't believe I bought this movie. I guess the cover with the person holding a chainsaw kind of made it interesting and I read some good reviews. I am tired of bad movies getting a pass because of pointless good reviews. The movie feels like it has no plot except for the opening scene. The rest is just nudity that doesn't add anything to the plot. The acting is amateur. This is a very boring and pointless movie. Save your money for something better.,1456617600,,455,4.364705882352941
