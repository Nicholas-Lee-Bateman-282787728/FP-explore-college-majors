The film may have been released theatrically in the US at 1.66:1 but if so THIS WAS WRONG. The OAR of the film is 1.37:1 and it is released in this ratio around the world (see the recent French DVD for example).",1076025600,6,387,4.243243243243243
491747,5,630264187X,"Sweden never had a civil war, but Ingmar Bergman imagined it in this brilliant film.  Like Stephen Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Shame"" brings home the horror of wholesale butchery without a drop of sentimentality.  Unlike that movie, though, ""Shame"" comes nowhere near hero-worship.  In fact, I think it's actually the more masterful of the two films, for it evokes war's brutality on a much smaller scale and yet with greater subtlety and closer attention to the impact of destruction on individuals.

Filmed in 1968, at the height of the Cold War, ""Shame"" portrays the ordeal of a young couple named Jan and Eva Rosenberg (Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann), who own a small farm on a remote island in Sweden and who struggle to survive as the conflict that ravages the mainland spills over and starts to engulfs them.  Jan and Eva are thoroughly apolitical and want nothing to do with the war.  While obviously evoking the competing totalitarian ideologies of the Cold War (communism & capitalism), Bergman's genius is that he never actually identifies what these two competing ideologies are.  By doing so, he creates a film that has no explicit political message except that that war is hell.  The film forces us to step outside our own narrow political prejudices and look directly at the effects of war on humanity, irrespective of politics.  For Bergman, belief systems are totally irrelevant.  By not even telling us what these people are fighting over in the first place, he focuses exclusively on the human tragedy involved.  Politics is extraneous to the issue at hand, which is that war destroys human life -- irrevocably and utterly.

Moreover, by setting this conflict in Sweden, an affluent Western country that has never been involved in a major modern war, Bergman makes us consider what war must feel like when it shows up in one of ""our"" societies.  This is no faraway place and it has not been ravaged by ancient feuds and incessant hatreds through the course of history.  It is as close to ""us"" here in the West as it could possibly be.  Furthermore, by setting ""Shame"" in a country as pristine and ""virgin"" as Sweden, Bergman brings home to us with quietly crushing force what most Europeans and Americans are now unable to fathom in hindsight due to so many decades of adjustment to it -- the savage, soul-splitting nightmare that devoured Europe whole in the 20th century and tore civilization apart at its seams.

The visual impact of this film is also stunning.  For while Scandinavian filmmakers had already filmed such incredible movies in color as ""Elvira Madigan"" (1967), Bergman chose to film this one in black and white.  The effect of the black-and-white still-shots of Sydow and Ullmann's faces is remarkable (and what a face Sydow has!).  The script and plot is phenomenal, alternating masterfully between understated and yet overpowering scenes of love and war.

A brilliant movie.  Five stars.",1074211200,,2934,4.934826883910387
491748,5,630264187X,"An innocent couple living on a farm in a place isolated from civilization suddenly find themselves in a war.  The film depicts in verismo style the changes the two undergo as events develop.  The shocking aspect is not just the brutality of the war, but that under the right circumstances people resort to animal behavior.  That's where shame comes in.
Warning:  be prepared to discover in very realistic fashion that the human race is not so noble after all.",1046304000,,459,4.772151898734177
491749,5,630264187X,"One doesn't think of Ingmar Bergman as a director of action or thriller (genre) movies.  But he directs the war sequences in ""Shame"" with stunning confidence.  It seems he could have made many more big (even epic) movies if he had been so inclined.  This film features Bergman veterans Von Sydow and Ullmann as ordinary people who are turned into refugees by a ferocious war in which they get caught.  They lose everything, are harassed, beaten and exploited.  Eventually the neurotic Von Sydow proves he will do anything to survive.  Simone Weil once wrote ""the great mystery of life is not suffering, but affliction.""  That is: suffering brings out the best in some people, others it turns into beasts.  This movie asks that most painful question: what would you do in the same situation?  The film presents a harrowing landscape of hell on earth that ends in a climax that will inevitably remind you of ""Titanic"", although Bergman did it first. It's more immediately accessible than many of Bergman's other movies because the anguish here takes external form, not just emotionally interior terror. A neglected masterpiece that should be seen at least as often as his other great works.",1042761600,36,1188,4.9296482412060305
491750,4,630264187X,"I don't care what people think of me after I make this statement. I don't care if people think I'm over dramatizing or if I sound pretentious. But, Ingmar Bergman, to me, is a cinematic genius! People offen ask me, why do you like Bergman? Aren't you a little too young to watch his films (I'm 18)? When asked these questions my answer is always the same. I watch Bergman's films because I simply love the way he shows the human condition. Unlike Hollywood filmmakers, I think his films are far more personal. He shows society at face values, our good sides and bad. As for me being too young. Well, do you have to be a certain age to have a love for the finer things?
 Bergman's films almost if not always conjure important issues. His films make you think. And, they, to me anyway, always have characters that we can relate to. His films leave an emotional impact on his audience. Watching films like ""Wild Strawberries"", or ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Through A Glass, Darkly"", ""Persona"", and ""Cries and Whispers"" they are all able to connect with the viewer. We feel for these characters. I've offen joked around and have said that the two characters in ""Strawberries"" and ""Seal"" are me! And ""Shame"" is just as powerful as any other Bergman film. The images we see on screen, grip us. They are intense, but, not like the way cop movies are. They are intense in a realistic point of view. ""Shame"" directed and written by Bergman stars Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman as Jan and Eva Rosenberg, former violinist, who have not played in some time. I assume this is due to the civil war that is happening. They live on a farm, far away from society. And, according to Jan (Sydow) that is a good thing. He follows the rule of, the less you know the better. He and Eva (Ullman) are having their own personal problems in they relationship. She wants to have a baby, and he thinks they should wait. They have no money, and it clearly is not safe where they are living. They can hear bombs being dropped and the sound of guns being fired. If all of this wasn't enough they are later accused of being in trust I suppose you can say with the enemy. Once you hit this point of the film it is the second ""act"". They are now put to the test to find out exactly what kind of people they are. Are they just or not? After a suprise ending we see that they have a lot of secrets they now must keep to each other, so they must live in ""Shame"" due to their actions. The cinematography by Sven Nykvist is wonderful. I feel his work really adds to the film. I found this film very hard to find. I actually had to leave Chicago to buy it lol. I don't know if anyone else had the same problem or not, but if you do, it's really worth the search. Great movie for those who haven't seen a Bergman film yet (""Shame"" on you! lol). Powerful, wonderful acting, great directing and photography. A Bergman masterpiece!",990662400,28,2879,4.341372912801484
491751,5,630264187X,"In conversations with Bergman, published as IMAGES: My Life in Film, Bergman says of Shame: ""Everything is shown in pictures, as in a nightmare. In a nightmare, I felt at home. In the reality of war, I was lost."" He feels that the first half of the film, showing the events of the war, is a failure, but that from the scene in the potato field onward, where the film becomes an interior work, showing how the weak fiddler becomes  ruthless while the strong woman falls apart, he's at his best. He wishes he had cut the opening half to ten minutes and expanded the second half. But while writing, shooting and editing, his superego could not allow the heavy weight of rethinking his master plan. He also comments that he lacked the precision to do the war scenes well, that he was not an American war film director who would have done them much better, nor had he the masterful ritual and matchless choreography of Japanese directors when they film violence (I suppose he means Toshiro Mifune in Yojimbo and Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, not the floating Hong Kong martial arts athletes---those films had not yet been made). I like this film very much but to be frank my favorite or most memorable moment is when Liv strips off her blouse and her beautiful bust swings forth. That was a brand new event in movies back in 1968, an actress showing her bust, and one could understand fully why Bergman had left his most recent wife, a pianist, for Liv---aside from for the glory of Liv's great talent.",980467200,5,1497,4.565055762081784
491752,5,630264187X,"I can hardly imagine a more bleak film, yet it is absolutely riveting to watch and there is something transcendent in the experience of seeing it.  As always, the performances are pitch perfect and the black & white medium ideal.  Scenes of horror and emotional brutality are then punctuated by moments of incredible beauty, humanity and redemption, but utlimately we watch two individuals and society as a whole disintegrate.  Bergman is reacting to many things here--including his and his nation's own mixed feelings of neutrality and complicity during WWII.  Yes, it's an anti-war fim, but it's much more.  Along with the earlier ""Persona,"" ""Hour of the Wolf"" and the later ""Passion of Anna,"" Bergman examines the awesome task of maintaining the integrity of our selves.",978652800,10,773,5.152
491753,5,630264187X,"How can I add to the comments above. They are all valid. Watching SHAME for me was as close to a real experience of war as possible. No other war film has had this effect on be except for Jansco's THE RED & THE WHITE.
The yellow subtitles are distracting. Turn off your colour and you will find the white subtitles just as easy to read.",972950400,3,336,4.106060606060606
491754,5,630264187X,"The details of this film pass with the gritty realism almost of a documentary.  Indeed of several documentaries: first about the intricacies of an ordinary marriage, then about the abrupt interruption of war, finally  a descent into brutality, some might say insanity. In all three regards,  the movie presents a powerful, because intimate, representation of the  human condition. Who cannot picture their own relationship with their  spouse at the beginning?  Who can watch the middle section without thinking  of Bosnia, or of Kosovo? Fortunately, most of us have been spared the  film's denouement (if denouement is the appropriate term here).
It is  from a structuralist perspective, however, that the film proves to be a  truly remarkable work. It is clearly allegorical, and like all allegories  it invites interpretation. It suggests many things, all conflictual: the  struggle of art against political and social brutishness (the broken  violin, the ruined hands, the smashing of a piano, etc.) It suggests the  defeat of simplicity (with an overtone of 'simple piety') in the face of  human complexity, and ultimately free will. Jan and Eva are not simple  people, yet they attempt the simple life as an escape from war. The war -  the human condition in extremis - catches up with them and takes them over  through death, prostitution, revenge. The film's most poignant moment  occurs as the aspiring mother, Eva, comes across a slaughtered infant,  mourns the death of innocence, as it were.
There are many other  allegorical levels at which this film plays, all of them valid  interpretations.
Yet it is as an allegory of love that the film held  greatest power for me. It's hardly an uplifting view of love, but then  Bergman never shies from the harsher portrayals of humanity. The film is  structured as a mirror turning upon itself.  At the begining, Jan is weak,  Eva acts. Jan has a dream, which reflects his inner turmoil and fear, Eva  listens less than attentively as she tries to get them to meet an  appointment with a ferry boat.  When Jan does attempt to act (by fixing the  radio, fixing the car, shooting a chicken) he fails miserably. She, on the  other hand, strides out into a river to procure a fish from her neighbor,  she cooks, she provides.
By the end of the film, it is Jan who is  acting, Eva who follows. Jan takes revenge, Jan kills for boots, Jan bribes  his way onto a boat, Jan steers.  The greater Jan's power to act, the  weaker and more dependent Eva becomes.
I am reminded of Sartre's  reflections on human relationships (etres pour autrui) where intimacy is  portrayed largely as a struggle between two beings for dominance.
What is  most powerful about Bergman's allegory here is the context in which this  struggle takes place. Eva's hegemony is one driven by the urge to nurture,  provide and give. Her great desire is to have a child, to give and nourish  life, an urge which she admits is instinctual. In Bergman's perverted  mirror, Jan is transformed into action by the destructive forces of war. He  takes life. At the end, wantonly. Eva's hegemony ends in the symbol of the  dead child.  Jan's in the unforgettable image of the dead floating  soldiers.
Love, in Bergman's allegory then, becomes symbolically a  struggle between life affirming forces and death. If the latter overcomes  the former, neither prevails.",944784000,13,3371,4.911032028469751
491884,3,630264187X,"Ingmar Bergman's 1968 effort SKAMMEN (Shame) is the auteur's only war film. Nevertheless, like all of his films from the Sixties, his main concern is human relationships. Jan (Max von Sydow) and Eva (Liv Ullmann) are two violinists living on a island off the coast. The country in which they live is fractured by civil war, and soon the islanders face an invasion by the other side. Jan is a unable to handle the threat of destruction, and is given over to crying. Eva hates this sensitivity and constantly rebukes him. Once the bombing starts, the divisions between them become even more polarized, especially once the local military commander Jacobi (Gunnar Bjornstrand) demands the attentions of Eva.

I love Bergman's work, but I find SKAMMEN rather disappointing compared to most of Bergman's output from the 1960s, in the main all masterpieces. His treatment of war lacks fluency, with the feeling that he is just using stock gestures of battle and confusion just to further the disintegration of the relationship. Another reviewer criticized Bergman's focus on the interpersonal when war is by its very nature something that touches all of society, and I agree. Personally, I think the scene in Bergman's earlier film TYSNADEN where the tanks roll by as the passengers are sitting in the train communicates the horror of war between than anything in SKAMMEN. And the role reversal at the end of the film, where Eva is the sensitive one and Jan has become cruel and confident under the constant violence, seems too pat.

Nonetheless, even poor Bergman is better than most other films, and there's a few praiseworthy things here. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, excellent. Bergman's fellow filmmaker and protege Vilgot Sjoman plays the director of a propaganda film, which I take as a wry jab at the director's art. The acting is fine, even if the script they are working with isn't the best. Gunnar Bjornstrand is especially memorable, since he finally gets to play a villain, and he plays him well enough that the audience despises the character.

The DVD includes a brief featurette which has a 2002 interview with Liv Ullmann and some commentary by Marc Gervais, with Bergman appearing from archival footage. Ullmann gushes about the film, saying it is the most important of all the films that she has acted in. But then one notes that Ullmann has a humanitarian bent, and sees in SKAMMEN a confirmation of her own cries for justice and better treatment of refugees. Gervais maintains a positive tone, but tries to lower the rhetoric a bit.",1251158400,,2562,4.939675174013921
491885,5,630264187X,"I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art, because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the simplistic notion that Ingmar Bergman's great 1968 film Shame (or Skammen) is merely an anti-war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex, and highly nuanced, film. Compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is seemingly a more classic film, in terms of narrative. But, the key word is seemingly, for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of Persona and the gaudy horror film homages of Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the best films ever made about war- and not as an anti-war film, nor a pro-war film. As such, it has to rank with Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films, as well as one of his best screenplays, if not the best.
  Although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it, it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod at the infamous American spies, whom many European intellectuals felt were innocent), two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out, and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island, content to working in a greenhouse. The country they live in is unnamed, as is the island they live on, although the film was made on Bergman's small island of Far, just off the northern end of the Swedish Island of Gttland. It seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province. This is all left deliberately hazy, as this war is meant to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen, as the credits roll. These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Era American military figures. After early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the coming of war, where even old men are conscripted, an aerial attack ravages the Rosenbergs' land, as enemy jets fly overhead, dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an Agent Orange like nature. One plane is hit, and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree. Jan, who starts off the film as a sniveling coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot. It seems he is, indeed, part of the invading, or possibly rebel, force. A bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home, as the Invaders are near.... there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level, such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the film commentary on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling, who has collaborated with the Invaders. But, this is clearly and demonstrably wrong, for Jacobi is with the original Fascist government. As proof, first off, the Invaders are repelled after they invade the Rosenbergs' land and shoot their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview, and words put into Eva's mouth, see the film as supposed proof of their treason, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, the Fascist Big Brother statists. Secondly, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps, for collaborating with the Invaders, and the Rosenbergs, again, are among those spared. Thirdly, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military, and clearly, if he was an Invader, he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state. Also, rebel forces are not official armies, and do not grant official leave. Lastly, Filip is clearly with the rebels, or Invaders, of the Organization, and why would he have killed a colleague?
  That Gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of Bergman's films. This is a wonderful and great film, and very high in the Berman canon, but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message, instead opting out for the cheap, lazy, and easy claim of its being merely anti-war, and a rather simple film in comparison to its two showier predecessors. And that, in the long run, is the real shame of Shame.",1221609600,4,4728,4.625

One day, invasion forces attack the country and the couple is forced to take a stand on the horrors of the war. When Bergman takes an interest in the outside world, nobody leaves without shame. It's not a war we see on the screen, it's WAR in its essence. Ingmar Bergman doesn't differentiate the soldiers, they look all the same and nobody understand why they fight. Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann must react and interact with the real world. Our world. Isn't it then frightening that our world looks like a dream to them ? Highly recommended.

491887,5,630264187X,"Bergman once remarked that he frequently wondered how he would measure up if caught in the chaos of war.  Could he survive, physically and emotionally, as a refugee?  ""Shame"" is his artistic exploration of the possibilities.

Released as the Vietnam War was entering its most brutal stage, the film was criticized by some as offering a too private view of war--Bergman, for example, refused to identify good or bad guys in his film, or even to hint at the cause of the war that serves as its backdrop.  But Bergman was trying to capture the experience of war on noncombatants:  the terror, the sense of powerlessness, the overwhelming chaos and radical contingency, the unpredictability, and the erosion of principle and identity.  Eva and Jan Rosenberg, played wonderfully by Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow, exemplify the way in which war destroys.  Eva longs for a child but recognizes that the new climate of death brought about by war precludes the possibility.  Jan, a weak-willed character at the film's beginning, becomes hardened and murderous toward the end.

The film closes with Eva, Jan, and other refugees adrift in the ocean in a small rowboat.  They've tried to flee their war-torn land.  But there's really no place to flee to.  War surrounds them, symbolized by a frightful slurry of drowned soldiers from a torpedoed ship through which their boat sails.  It's clear that the refugees will die out there on the water, alone and surrounded by death.  War has stripped them down to their ultimate nakedness, humiliating them in the process but also revealing who they--and we--are, just as Adam and Eve were stripped naked and ""were ashamed.""

Ullmann's acting has never been better.  Two scenes in particular are memorable:  toward the beginning of the film, when she and Jan share a meal and talk about having a child, and the final scene, in which she tells Jan of a dream she's had of burning roses.",1220054400,,1917,4.867283950617284

The couple of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine, as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused, and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war.

Shame is an excellent film but also the one which is almost impossible to sit through - that's how bleak, pessimistic, and hopeless it is.

491890,5,630264187X,"At the apex of the Viet-Nam protest, the Quaker College I attended conducted an anti-war symposium that included a screening of Ingmar Bergman's The Shame. Even as a child I was an avid (and oddly discerning) film buff, but at this juncture the world of foreign cinema, not readily available in my hometown, awaited my discovery. Well, after viewing this, my first Bergman film, never would I view cinema as a medium for artistic expression in the same way. So began my lifelong study of Ingmar Bergman's gargantuan contribution, not only to the history of world cinema, but art itself. Shame, in my opinion, ranks among Bergman's greatest achievements, outdone PERHAPS only by Cries and Whispers and Persona.

Now, as quickly as possible here: Shame is, on a superficial plane, one of Bergman's more accessible films. Detractors, never failing to complain about the fictional or peripheral aspect of the war Bergman depicts, are missing his intent, which, as always, is to underline the human element. Far greater minds than mine have examined Bergman's use of war as a universal thematic catalyst that reflects the degradation war visits upon our species--the very species that conceived and continues to deploy it. Simply put, one expecting to see the good guys waste the bad guys will be sorely disappointed.

Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman are brilliant, period. The film also boasts a superb supporting performance from the great Gunner Bjrnstrand. Sven Nykvist's photography has always rendered superlatives inadequate, but here especially. His contribution to the Bergman cannon, beginning with The Virgin Spring, is immeasurable. Finally, anyone not moved by the film's devastating conclusion must stand accused of lacking a heart--of insensitivity to a theme as timelessly poignant today as always.

491891,4,630264187X,"If you're like me and you've only watched a few Ingmar Bergman films, SHAME is going to take more than one viewing to absorb.  Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow play musicians Jan and Eva Rosenberg.  At least they were musicians.  Now they seem to be living a rural life, raising lingonberries and such to sell in town.  The movie opens slowly on their domestic home life.  Bergman spends some little bit of time introducing us to them, observing their not-quite perfect marriage.

 It takes a while before we see the first convoy of motorized guns pass by.  Longer still before we see someone in uniform, or a gun is fired.  It's slowly revealed that the land is undergoing a civil war.  Eventually bomb dropping planes will appear, along with paratroopers, interrogation squads, and quislings.  Throughout it all we cleave close to the young couple, especially Ullmann's character, and see the events through her eyes.  The war itself is never explained in any conventional sense.

 SHAME is the oddest anti-war movie I've ever seen.  Who is fighting and what is being fought over is never explained.  The two lead characters are affected by the war and change, but that change occurs at a snail's pace.  You have to lean into Bergman's movies, pay attention `cause he's not going to throw a lot of plot at you, and if you're in a hurry you'll be disappointed.  Of course, if you're not in a hurry you'll probably find yourself worn down by its grinding pessimism.

 I cribbed the title of this review from Marc Gervais's commentary track.  Like many good c-tracks, it helped me appreciate and get a handle on a movie that mystified me a bit the first time through.

Putting aside the context of a factional civil conflict, we are at war with one another and likely with our very selves. However much we try to escape the threats to our identity, as well as our physical and emotional well-being presented by the inherent instability of modernity, running away to hide out does not help. Salvation does not come (colonel Jacobi is not a charitable savior).

491893,3,630264187X,"This is the third Bergman film I've seen without encountering anything that might be called 'genius'.

Genius in film, however it might be defined, is something that's obvious. You can't watch five minutes of a film by Kurosawa, Fellini, or Kubrick (or Tarkovsky, to mention someone strongly influenced by Bergman) without knowing you're seeing something extraordinary. But with Bergman, you find skill, intelligence, ability, sensitivity... but nothing more.

""Shame"" is a war film made at the height of the Vietnam war. Whatever else can be said of the era, discussion of war was at its most intense and serious. So what's Bergman's contribution? Well, it seems that war is very tough on whimpering neurotics. (Von Sydow's character is such a crybaby you wonder why Ullman doesn't simply puish him in front of the next tank.)

There are good things in the film -- a clever scene in which Ullman's character is made to pose for a propaganda film without her knowledge, a truly frightening sequence of artillery firing in a wood. But none of it goes anywhere. In the second half, Bergman falls back on his true interest, personal relationships. It's as if he was saying that war has its roots in failures on the personal level (a not uncommon claim at the time). This is nonsense. War is a mass phenomenon and must be understood as such. To do otherwise is to try and understand a hurricane through close study of a raindrop.

With no other way to wrap it up, Bergman at last puts his characters on a boat in an attempt to flee the country. They immediately get lost on the high seas. Watching this tragic sequence, I was overwhelmed by the single thought: How the hell do you get lost in the Baltic?

Bergman was simply not a man 'o war. There are plenty who were. I'd recommend ""Ran"", ""Paths of Glory"", even ""Private Ryan"". ""Shame"" can be left to the devotees.",1128211200,2,1862,4.699386503067485

491950,5,630264187X,"Maybe I interpret this movie differently, but considering that it was produced in 1968--I feel it was an allegory for the Viet Nam war which was raging at the time.  With the nightly news  bringing war into our living rooms Bergman wanted to wake us up by showing the same horrors the Vietnamese faced--as inflicted upon Westerners--homes burnt, people displaced, enemies on both sides of the conflict etc

Had the suffering of the Vietnamese people resulted in an indifference--which when seen pepetrated on people of ""Our own kind""-seemed more horrible?

My interpretation aside, this is an excellent movie--the hell of war and the bleakness of life for those caught between factions and the ramifications of seemingly innocent acts.  Ullman is excellent as the apparently stronger wife and Von Sydow plays the part of the weak willed/spirited husband to perfection.  I haven't seen all of Bergman's films--but I would place this one between ""The Seventh Seal"" and ""The Passion of Anna""--all three movies being excellent",1126310400,,1022,5.201219512195122
491951,5,630264187X,"This movie is profound...far beyond any of his other works which I have seen...I've seen most of the ones which have been released.  I've seen this film 8 times, and still find new meaning each time.  Each person has to find his or her own meaning, of course.  I don't want to spoil your first experience with the film so don't read on if you are afraid of this.  However, if you want some clues and do not want to see it 8 times do read on.

Watch Eva's motivation....It is all motherhood...the mother giving nourishment to her unborn child and to the child men she encounters in this film.  She is, of course, tired of babying Jan.  She wants her own children, but realizes early that this can never be....her maternal feelings flow to the mayor and then to the young soldier.

Also, all of the dreams are very important!  From the first (from Jan) who just wants to ignore all that is happening and return to more pleasant times, to Eva's last when she essentially tells us that God is a sadistic monster (at least in this form) who enjoys the beauty of destroying life and motherhood's creativity... The beauty of the roses on fire:  A very Hindu concept which identifies the negative aspects of the Godhead. Even Eva's life is wasted because she cannot remember what she should from her last dream.  A wasted incarnation?

Does God feel Shame?  Note Eva's feeling early in the film that she is compelled to participate in someone else's dream...""what happens when the dreamer awakens and feels ashamed?""  Who is the dreamer, the people who are at war or God in his terrible fantasy of us, or both?  I think this statement is the origin of the title, ""Shame.""

And is this really a war movie?  The war is far away...although all around too. we see glimpses of carnage...but not really. We do see the dead child held by Eva. We get the feeling that Eva's and Jan's relationship is doomed from the start even if there were peace.  Jan is a narcissistic weak man and would  probably never father her children anyway. There are questions about his fertility. He wants to be her baby. He complains of his hurts hoping to get sympathy.  She wants a real man who can father her children, however.

My God what a bleak film and yet what insight from Bergman!
The acting could not be better...the photograpy is wonderful.  The last scene....well judge for yourself. Burned in my memory!

Autumn Sonata comes in as my second favorite...but this movie will always stay with me.

I am a psychologist.  I would not encourage people who are the least bit suicidal to see this movie.  So, if you are the least bit unstable...go on to happier stuff. But if you are adventurous and think you are of really sound mind...take a look and see if you can answer the questions about life in this film.  You will also note the parallels to today's world.

I'd say this film has impressed me more than any other film I have ever seen.",1110758400,5,2913,4.50763358778626
491952,1,630264187X,"After reading so much about Ingmar Bergman as a director, I was excited to view ""Shame"" for a film class. However, I was to be disappointed with Bergman's war movie. The characters are irritating at best, the plot slow and random. I could not find a coherent plot throughout the entire movie, and at times I wanted to slap Jan the husband for not being more assertive with his wife. This movie may be good for film scholars studying the subject, but for the mainstream movie-goer I'd reccommend staying away from this one.",1108425600,5,522,4.623655913978495
491953,2,630264187X,"Shame, was an in-depth view of a couple trying to make it through a civil war. Eva, ever the pessimist when the film commences and her often childish husband Jan seem to be an odd couple. Through the film the rigors of relationship and marriage are thrown at the couple as they see their life crumble around them. I found the plot to be very interesting, but the movie was a bit slow for my taste. It seems to drag at times and some of the shots in the movie appeared a bit odd. Bergman the director chooses some odd times to cut in and out of scenes and I was a bit lost at times. Some of the camera angles and shots were very well done on the other hand. Some of the eye level shots of them at the dinner table were very conducive to setting the mood and portraying the scene effectively. The use of dreams throughout the movie was also well done. The film begins and ends that way and it reminds the viewer of tragicness of the situation Eva and Jan are in. The film's most movie scene is not subtle in any manner. As the couple's boat wades through the water the dead bodies that suddenly engulf it is a disturbing site. It really burns an image into the viewer's mind of the harsh realities of war. All in the all I like how the film was shot, but the story was just a bit too slow for my taste.",1108252800,2,1300,4.08203125

Everything about the movie is great - the performances, the photography, the script etc etc. What disappointed me with the film was the lack of authenticity depicted in the war scenes. I guess before movies like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie would have been considered very realistic in the way the war was depicted. However Bergman had never done a war movie before and it shows. Still, the other aspects of the film are top notch and overall worthy of 4 stars.",1104710400,,593,4.5514018691588785

491957,5,630264187X,"Shame (Skammen) is a drama set in a pre-war and war where the film depicts the interpersonal relationship between Eva (Liv Ullman) and Jan (Max von Sydow) and how the present  circumstances affect the couple.  Jan is a neurotic dreamer who attempts to avoid anything that causes him any level of discomfort.  His wife, Eva, is a hopeful realist with dreams about a better future where they both can be happy.  Eva is the anchor that secures Jan in their mundane existence on a small farm on a remote island as they have withdrawn from public life.  Jan is the reason why they no longer live in an urban area because he does everything within his powers to stay away from people and civilization.  The solitude is wearing on Eva, which emerges every now and then in the shape of irritation.  However, Eva expresses her deep love for Jan by hiding her irritation and instead focuses on the happy moments that they have.  Eva and Jan are aware of the imminent threat of war as their neighbors inform them occasionally, but when the war breaks out they are not prepared for its brutality as it tears them apart.  They both realize that they distance themselves from each other as their characters slowly change.  Bergman personifies the rift that develops between couples as they emotionally part during a phase when change comes from dramatic situations.  The subtlety in which the confrontation between Eva and Jan is illustrated in is an example of Bergman's refined skills as a storyteller as he places them in a war where the couple does not wage war against each other.  Shame offers a painfully cinematic experience, however, this is Bergman's intentions as he brings another brilliant event to the audience.",1076889600,3,1711,4.782312925170068

Then the soldiers invade and their lives are massively changed.

Bergman set a civil war in Sweden, if Sweden is indeed the country where the fictitious film is set.  Sweden has never been the scene of a civil war in modern times.

What the farmers wish is just to be left alone, but the war catches up to them and ruins their lives.

Get ready for the horrors of war, which Bergman introduces (I have never experienced war and I hope that I never will but I imagine it is a lot like this), as well as the cruelty of the human race, which seems to know no bounds.

At the end of the film, the male farmer shoots a young man.  Has he finally become as evil as.the invading army of soldiers?

I may be insane, but I actually found a good portion of it powerfully, blackly funny, in a sort of 'Dr. Strangelove', Roy Andersson, dryly Scandanavian sort of way.

The surreal insanity of the behavior of the soldiers and officials around our normal working-class couple seemed so exaggerated, almost Keystone Cops with guns, that it DID seem effectively anti-war, but not in the way seen by those who cite it's unrelieved depression and misery as being where the film gets its power.

That said, it certainly seemed to grow ever more 'real', and by the end felt truly dramatic and haunting.

I wonder how I could so misread Bergman's intentions. Certainly, if we're supposed to take the early to middle completely seriously and literally the film would work much less well for me than it did, since the horrors these people are exposed to on a literal level seem like nothing compared to the victims of 'real world' wars, where they probably would have been dead very quickly.

On the main land there is an unspecified war going on and on the island preparations are made in case the war might spread to the island.
Eva and Jan are apolitical and do not understand much of what is happening or what might happen. They live quite an isolated life. Though their relationship is not always easy, they do have their tender moments.

This movie is not about heroism or revenge. It is about the impact of war on a man and a woman living together.
It all comes so close. For Eva and Jan - and for the viewer.
There is tenderness and there is the destructiveness of war, there is violence and there is vulnerability.

Despite of the action, this is basically a psychological movie with well-written dialogue. It is very powerful and atmospheric. And yes, it is bleak also. It is an unusual experience to watch it.
