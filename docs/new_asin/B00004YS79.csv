7927683,1,B00004YS79,"Hope really should have stopped making movies after The Paleface.  This one in particular is so mean-spirited and unfunny that all you can really do is gape.  Its view of marriage is right up there with the Three Stooges (remember the short films in which the three of them were married?) and enough to swear a teen viewer off the institution for life.  Yet it's one of those bad movies I like to turn on when it (rarely) shows up on TV, maybe because of the now-quaint 60s art decoration and costumes, maybe because rarely before or since have performers of such talent squandered it so egregiously.  (To its credit, though, I have to add that ""Cancel My Reservation"" makes this one look like ""The Magnificent Ambersons."")",976579200,7,723,4.669291338582677
