8151647,5,B000JLQQ4O,This documentary focuses on the daily routines of children who are taught kung fu at a Shaolin temple. The kids are very talented! Most interesting to me was watching their reactions while they were watching a kung fu movie. At least one of them looked very disturbed.,1346284800,,268,4.723404255319149
8151648,4,B000JLQQ4O,"This is a pretty poorly produced little documentary. - I mean the quality of the film. It's subtitled in English, and they speak Chinese (which is fine for me). The information is pretty cool, and seeing how difficult it is & what all the little fellows in the dvd have to endure is just amazing. These kids are absolutely amazing. I don't know what else to say besides that. I learned a lot from the documentary, about the shaolin lifestyle, what they have to go through on a daily basis, their training regiments, i learned a bit about Buddhism & etc. It's worth the money. :)",1212883200,6,578,4.462264150943396
