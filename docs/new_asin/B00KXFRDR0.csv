6453494,2,B00KXFRDR0,"It's good, except one problem, the frame rate, It's supposed to have a high rate like it did when it first showed up on TV on Nick, even on a SDTV, but on the DVD, it's 1/2.5 of the rate it shows, it's like the edited scenes on EVERY SINGLE PART, No wonder DVD always either caps the frame rate to that of film, which is 1/2.5 of Every Witch Way, or forgets to either interpolate it or click the 60 fps button and then burn it, the low frame rate is the only FLAW!
2/5 / 4/10.",1428710400,3,476,3.86734693877551
