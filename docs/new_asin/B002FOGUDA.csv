3923485,5,B002FOGUDA,"It's possible that only another musical virtuoso, like Itzhak Perlman or Wynton Marsalis, has the musical wherewithall to appreciate the sheer greatness of Live in Korea. You see, the soloing on this DVD is so over the top that, for example, somewhere between 51:30 and 55:00 you'll be needing a new pair of shorts--admit it.

You'd think that after all of these years Yngwie might slow down or maybe not pay that much attention to detail. Just the opposite is true. The speed, fluidity, and precision is at new heights in this performance. I believe that he even impresses himself inspiring him to play even better and more extremely. Yngwie never lets up in this gem of a DVD.

I always wanted to hear what WTEAW would sound like live and unexpurgated--Live in Korea is the answer. This is neoclassical stylings the likes we've never heard before--an A+ performance from start to finish.

This DVD isn't just another chapter in the life of The Maestro--it's a landmark event that should go down in history as the ultimate in virtuoso shred equal to anything Paganini could conjure up. I HIGHLY recommend this fantastic Live in Korea DVD!!",1256515200,4,1140,4.8061224489795915
3923486,4,B002FOGUDA,"I was expecting Yngwie Malmsteen's Live in Korea to be current/recent footage from his Perpetual Flame tour. I was disappointed when I received the DVD in the mail and found this was not so... at first.
After a closer look at the track listing I became very intrigued. Turns out this is concert footage from the War to End All Wars tour (2001). I know for many this was one of Yngwie's lesser studio albums (mainly due to poor mixing and weaker song lyrics) but hearing some of these tracks live was quite enjoyable. I was actually surprised to see how many tracks from this album he performed live. SEVEN in total! So this does make for a rare and unusual release. But no concert dvd would be complete without the classics as well which are all here.

Track list:

Rising Force
Catch 22
Crucify
The Wizard
Adagio/Far Beyond The Sun
Wild One
Miracle of Life
Bad Reputation
Trilogy Suite/guitar solo
Masquerade
The Seventh Sign
Acoustic guitar solo/Black Star
I'll See the Light Tonight

The only negative things I found with this DVD (which kept me from giving it a 5 star rating) was the lighting made it very difficult to watch in spots. Between too much smoke and the busy, wild lighting, (or lack thereof) you couldn't see much of what was going on. Also, this is really a bare bones release. Not even a menu or chapter selection.
But this shouldn't stop you from checking this concert dvd out!
 Also, this was around the time Yngwie was battling alcoholism and while his playing is sharp and he sounds as good always there are many that have given him flack for his bloated appearance around this time so if you're shallow enough for something like this to bother you then you're better off avoiding this one. This release is more for his dedicated fans. ;)",1256083200,14,1762,4.5664556962025316

Why do we need yet another YJM live DVD ???

8369303,3,B002FOGUDA,I always enjoy watching Yngwie live. However the quality of the recording left me disappointed.,1458086400,,95,5.4
8369304,2,B002FOGUDA,"I've been a huge YJM fan for many years and I try to see him in concert every chance I get, and also to get my hands on every concert video I can. This video, while I am glad I bought it as I'm always happy to watch Yngwie and his band perform, is by far the worst and least watched in my collection. The musicianship is awesome as always, but the video itself is as somebody mentioned bootleg quality, if that. At this moment as I'm watching it all I can see is a silhouette of Yngwie, and his arms and guitar neck have actually disappeared as they've been washed out by the intense blue lighting. A few times I've even seen just a blue screen on my TV.

A couple of people praised this DVD for its sound quality; I have to disagree. The keyboards are extremely loud, often drowning Malmsteen out. I had to check the DVD case again to see if Mats Olausson's name appears above Yngwie's on the front!

Another minor complaint I have is at the beginning of each track the song title appears at the bottom of the screen, and though I'm not keeping track of them I have noticed that some of them are incorrect (as an example, I believe they had ""Crucify"" labeled as ""Bedroom Eyes"", which is an entirely different Malmsteen song that isn't even on this DVD).

As I said, I'm glad to have this video to watch on occasion (maybe twice in the past year or so now) and I hate that I had to give it such a low rating. My favorite videos by YJM so far are the Live in Japan '85 and Live in Brazil 1998 (I've also seen it titled as ""Live Animal""). I'd suggest checking out those two videos if you get the chance, but don't use them as the standard to compare this video to.",1442793600,,1662,4.139318885448916

8369308,1,B002FOGUDA,"I don't typically write reviews for products, but I just couldn't hold myself back from commenting on this worthless piece of crap. I regret not reading the few reviews prior to my purchase which warned about the video quality. If you are hoping for close-ups of Yngwie's playing, you will be sorely disappointed since all you see is a silhouette washed out by many lights. There are some incredible solos in typical Mamsteen fashion; however Mark's voice is terrible. I absolutely loved him on Trilogy, but his high pitched screams throughout the show are revolting. Other's have said they would transfer the concert to mp3, but I'd have to find a way to remove the vocals in order to sit through the experience again. The only reason why I am forcing myself to kill a small part of my life is because I want to at least feel my few dollars didn't completely go to waste. I ordered Live in Brazil and the Budokan concert before watching this and only hope it won't turn out as crappy.",1344643200,,985,4.570621468926554
8369309,2,B002FOGUDA,"We can see why it took eight years for the coffers to run dry enough that this concert finally had to be released, with some sense of shame or embarrassment, one must assume.

Imagine taking a 2nd or 3rd generation bootleg VHS -- the sort fans used to trade -- then transferring it to a DVD recorder via $3 composite video cables purchased at Walmart, and you have some idea what you're being asked to pay for here. The quality is shocking for an official release, and the transfer is genuinely from an old videotape; if your TV is set to zero overscan, you'll see the telltale fuzzy tracking stripe at the bottom edge of the screen, plus many other artifacts betraying the tape source -- bands, flickers, flashes -- throughout the show, if you're looking for them. The image is also very soft; VHS had only 240 lines of horizontal resolution.

The bungled production of the concert itself does not improve the image. The stage is forever thick with obscuring dry ice, like some dreadful metal parody, and flooded with murky blue and lurid pink lights. As the crew seem to be without a spotlight, the result is like the later scenes of The Abyss: an endless, mysterious blue murk, populated now and again by undefinable signs of neon-hued life. I do not overstate this. You literally cannot see what is happening. Except when you don't want to.

Yngwie falls over at the beginning of Catch 22, after which he swaps guitars several times. Later, during Crucify, he fails his famous guitar twirl, getting the Strat stuck on his back, flailing his arms, trying to recapture it. Mark Boals refuses to sing the word ""Lucifer"" during Seventh Sign. The Wizard is labeled on screen as Bedroom Eyes. By the time Boals asks, at the halfway point, ""Ready for some more?!"" you find yourself seriously considering the answer.

But that would mean missing Miracle of Life, perhaps the best performance of the show, where everyone seems to give their best. A torturously good moment, one of few, that makes you want to love the disc; makes you wish it wasn't such a mess. This is one of precious few live Malmsteen videos free of overdubs, too, the way it should be. If only it was watchable.

I'm a huge fan. I have every album, obscure Japanese releases, training DVDs, two of his signature guitars, one of his pedals, even a knitted damn hat. The quality of this release insults us fans, who it is assumed will pay for anything. An artist (or management) who cared would have sourced the original broadcast tapes or a digital transfer of same, not just duplicated an old approval copy VHS laying around the house.

Needless to say: no 5.1 mix; no extras; not even a menu. Avoid unless you want to prove them right -- that we're quality-blind morons.",1265760000,8,2737,4.63298969072165
8369310,3,B002FOGUDA,"This show sounds awesome. Too bad I can't see what's going on. Cameras on floor or too far back and everything is covered in fog most of the time. Good quality of picture, bad camera operation and angles.
A great show to enjoy on CD after converting.

So, overall a C+.",1265155200,2,269,4.2745098039215685

8369312,3,B002FOGUDA,"I was originally going to say ""Only hardcore Yngwie fans should buy this"", but apparently others are not bothered by what bothers me.

While I agree with the other reviewers that his playing is over the top and intense, the quality of the video sucks! There are way too many lights flashing and it's mostly blue and red, not to mention the fire pots exploding. Basically YOU CAN'T SEE YNGWIE! All you see is a silhouette and only during short interludes (like when he's standing next to a fire pot) can you see his fingers, and any and every guitar player wants to see that and maybe get a glimpse as to how he does what he does.

As far as a song list, it's decent, although I can do without ""Rising Force"" for the trillionth time.

Again, great playing, but a very annoying visual experience. I'm just going to save it to MP3 and toss it on my iPod and enjoy it from an audio stand point.
