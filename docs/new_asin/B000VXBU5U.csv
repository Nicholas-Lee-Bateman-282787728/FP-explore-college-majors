8325822,5,B000VXBU5U,"Master Hirokazu Kanazawa 10th Dan, Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation is (with the addition of a very few) one of the last Samurai.

This excellent DVD combines a revealing and open interview with Master Kanazawa, along with footage of him teaching classes, demonstrating various types of Kumite from the Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation syllabus, Tekki 3 and Nijushiho katas. It also includes some VERY rare footage of Master Kanazawa practicing some Tai-Chi forms; an art of which he is also a Master of.

Master Kanazawa's humility and dedication to Karate-Do is evident in this excellent DVD.",1202169600,,616,5.473684210526316
