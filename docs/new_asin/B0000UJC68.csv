1946646,2,B0000UJC68,I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the DVD format is not user friendly.  You can't forward from pose to pose.  There aren't short or long workouts to choose from.  It looks like a 70s video tape stuck on a disc.  He also doesn't explain the poses very well and this dvd is definitely not for beginners.  But if you have experience the different poses may be relavant to your own personal workout.  I'm still can't decide if I want to return it or not.  It's just not very appealing.,1123545600,4,495,4.315217391304348
1946647,2,B0000UJC68,"Ok, so generally, it's not so bad. The poses are fun, although there aren't very many that you don't find on most yoga dvds, and the speed of the flow is good, slow enough so you really get into the pose, but not so slow that it gets boring.

The main problem I have with this DVD is that some of the instructions are inadequate, and the poses shown are often done in a way that can lead to injury. For instance, in Warrior I and II, the knee is bent to a narrow angle, not a wide angle. It goes past the toes, wich is really hard on the knee. Even in standing forward bend, Naader makes you squat so you sit on your heals, then come up in the forward bend. If you have knee problems, you know this is a bad idea. Also, there are no modification suggested if you can't do the poses like he does (wich, for the post part, is almost impossible unless you have alot of practice). If you have done alot of yoga in the past, you can just ignore the faulty instructions and do it the safe way, but I definetly would not recommend this dvd to a beginner.

Other minor problems I have with this dvd are the ugly background (flashy pink and blue, 80s style)and the absence of a good menu (you can only select to do one workout, even though it is divided in different sections that should allow for choosing the ones you want to do on a particular day). He also does a little prayer at the beggining (that actually ends with ""amen"") wich I personnaly thought was uncalled for.

Basically, this isn't a great dvd. It's not horrible, but there's much better out there. I would recommend Ali MacGraw's Yoga Mind & Body or Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti instead. They are both absolutely wonderfull. If you are a true beginner, I recommend Yoga Journal's Step-by-step 3 pack, which has the best instructions and great workouts.

Namaste.",1123113600,39,1816,4.316715542521994
1946648,5,B0000UJC68,"I first found this series when it came out on VHS and my husband and I began practicing.  It was our first taste of hatha yaga and we were HOOKED!  As a matter of fact we were so inspired we traveled to Pasadena, California from Montana to meet Naader Shagagi and take a class with him in person.  Well, we were so inspired by this man's complete and balanced understanding of hatha yoga, breathing and focus that we decided to completely change our lives and open our own yoga studio in our hometown of Bigfork, Montana.  The rest is history.

If you want to transform your lives and begin to study TRUE hatha yoga, buy this DVD!",1115078400,5,630,4.35042735042735
1946649,5,B0000UJC68,"This Dvd is phenomenal. Its purity and grace reflect the true art of Yoga.  Naader Shagagi demonstrates his amazing skill and ability to reach out to all levels. His one on one approach with the practitioner works beautifully.  Since he is the only one doing the postures I feel like I am experiencing a private lesson.  No other students to contend with or copy.  Just Naader and me. The gentle music in the backround flows perfectly with each posture.  His detailed explanations of each pose and how they benefit the body are wonderful.  His philosophy and gentle demeanor bring peace to the soul.  This DVD is for everyone.  Some postures are very difficult but as Naader says, ""Maybe that is all you can do for now"".  He never puts on any pressure just encouragement. He is truly a master of this art. Thankyou Naader for a DVD that will never just sit on my shelf.  The Power Of Hatha Yoga will leave you physically fit, mentally alert and spiritually awakened.",1107475200,13,966,4.629411764705883
1946650,5,B0000UJC68,"I have purchased many, many DVDs and tapes for practicing yoga at home, and LOVE this one the best! Though the full practice is about an hour and 20 minutes, it's broken into three sections that allows you to do a short practice or longer one (I usually do the long one when I do it!). I have felt a strong progression in my strength from doing this series that blows away progress made from power yoga.
I wish there were more like it on the market, for variety!",1089504000,25,462,4.202247191011236
1946651,5,B0000UJC68,"I am fortunate to be able to study yoga with Naader at his Pasadena, CA studio. I continue to be impressed with his well-rounded  yoga instruction, including an emphasis on breath, will-power, and concentration. This video is the next best thing to being in Naader's class. His visual and verbal instruction is very clear. His calm voice and inspiring words encourage you throughout the workout. If you practice with this video I guarantee you will improve your strength, balance, and flexibility.",1070841600,14,497,5.135802469135802

8003129,4,B0000UJC68,Bought this for my wife. She does yoga everyday and has enjoyed picking up some new exercises that she did not know before.,1384128000,,123,4.391304347826087
8003130,5,B0000UJC68,"This is one of my favourite yoga DVDs. The workout is hard and rewarding. There is a real sense of earnestness to the video which works, and a 1980s feel to the way the video looks but it doesn't change the fact that this is an excellent DVD. The teacher is calm and encouraging, totally unlike what you get in so many other yoga videos that are made by overly perky dilettantes who come across as phonies too tightly wound to practice, never mind teach, yoga. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who has practiced yoga and is past the beginner stage. I use this DVD on my ""hard"" day of yoga and intersperse other easier workouts in between, including Ali McGraw's yoga DVD which is great but unfortunately out of print. (It should be brought back, it my other favourite and shot beautifully. It's timeless.)
Be careful not to push yourself too hard. (I skip the inverted poses). I know that I look and feel 10x better when I am regularly using this DVD. It's great for trimming, firming and getting into a zen state of mind.",1355270400,2,1029,4.449735449735449
8003131,5,B0000UJC68,"I've tried many different yoga videos.

This is my favorite.

If you have done Bikrahm, the sequence will seem very familiar.",1272931200,,125,4.904761904761905
8003132,5,B0000UJC68,"All of Naader's DVD's are stupendous. Just make sure and pick the one that's right for your level of practice, and you can't go wrong.",1225065600,,134,4.4
8003133,4,B0000UJC68,"It seems the people who give this DVD bad reviews are unfamiliar with Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga generally consists of the same poses in the same order no matter who the instructor is. There shouldn't be a short version of the workout because the asanas should be done for a specific amount of time and in order.

Someone complained about the way forward bend is done but anyone who has been to a Bikram Studio has been taught to do it in the same way.

The background is, shall we say, retro but that's not what the DVD is about is it?

All in all I would say no yoga video should be the be all end all of anyone's practice only a supplement to proper instruction from a teacher. I know no one wants to hear that but it's really the only way to learn effectively.",1173139200,3,760,4.156462585034014

8003135,5,B0000UJC68,"This is great!

I disagree with the other reviewer that this is faulty instruction, but I do agree that it lacks the menu and chaptering. You need to know that this is an intermediate practice, so the poses are not explained in detail. It also assumes you are able to determine your own level of practice and what your body can endure (definitely an intermediate practice)!

I love this practice and Naadar Shagagi will give you reminders about the postures and especially your breath. You will increase your will, concentration, strength, and flexibility by practicing this routine. I also would like to mention if you practice Bikram yoga that you will enjoy this DVD. It is somewhat similar, but will take you a level further than Bikram's beginner's class. The sun salutation, shoulderstand, fish, and many other posture are not in Bikram's routine. I would recommend practicing in a warm room for the most benefit. I love the music, especially at the end.

The first 40 min are standing postures, then a rest, then on to floor postures. Total practice is about 1.5 hours.

Here's the sequence of his practice:

Standing Paranayama (Breathing)

Sun Salutation (2 rounds)

Half Moon (2 variations)

Akward Pose (Naadar's performace is beautiful!)

Eagle

Triangle ( 4 variations)

Wide Leg forward bend

Warrior variations

Tree

Savasana (rest)

Leg Lifts

Knees to Chest (with forhead to knees to activate your thyroid gland)

Forward Bend

Cobra

Airplace

Lotus

Bow

Full Cobra

Half Tortoise

Knee Reclining

Rabbit

Camel

Inversion (should stand and plough with a great, long hold!)

Fish (advanced variation)

Bridge

Backbend (I love this!)

Alternating 1 leg forward bend

Forward Bend

Easy Pose (legs cross and forward bend)

Spinal Twist

Kalibati (Breath of fire)

Relaxation

Your own Meditation

The only thing I might mention is with some of the standing poses Naadar is not able to keep his knees together. You want to make sure you keep your knees together, but since this is intermediate you knew that already ;o)

Naadar is a beautiful, kind person and reminds you that Confidence = Courage = Strength :o)

Please see my other reviews on Amazon",1160697600,42,2169,4.98314606741573
8003136,5,B0000UJC68,This is a great DVD.  I have had this DVD now for a few months and the postures I have learned from the DVD are incredible.  Practicing the Yoga techniques taught by Nadder has totally changed the way I practice yoga.  I am able to concentrate more and my nervous system is much more relaxed and at ease.,1132790400,,304,4.206896551724138
