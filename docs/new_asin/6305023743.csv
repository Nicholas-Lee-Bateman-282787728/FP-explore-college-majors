948738,5,6305023743,"I am a bilingual hungarian and have seen Macskafogo countless times. I haven't seen the english version yet but i am sure that it will never reach the hungarian level of humor or the use of the tone of voice, simply because it was written in hungarian for hungarians who are able understand the password to the mouse base for that matter and appreciate the cleverness behind it, which goes like this: egy aprocska kalapocska, benne csacska macska mocska. roughly means: a tiny hat, in it the filth of a silly cat. See the difference?
i do believe though that it will be worth watching in english and i look forward to it. Every time i watched it i had a great time and just couldn't get away from the telly. The characters'  voices are impossible to copy, best solution would be watching it with english subtitles. Enjoy it. :)",1061856000,4,827,4.513333333333334
948739,5,6305023743,"I'm an other hungarian, who loves it since childhood. The editorial rewiew absolutely missunderstands it (or the english translation is bad) takeing it too seriously. It's not in James Bond-style, it's funny and light. In wich James Bond-movie could happen, in example, that (in the middle of a battle in a city) the bullets and rockets at a crossover politely stops in the air and waits for the green light? The vampire bats aren't stereotyphicals: after listening their victim's tromphet solo decides to not kill such a talented young mouse, and at the end theye will become a jazz-band. I don't consider it a stereothype :).",1050624000,3,627,4.9245283018867925
948740,5,6305023743,"well, i want to start with this: i AM hungarian, saw the movie several times, but i cant seem to bored with it.... Dont anyone beleive that editorial review, its really stupid. ""Macskafog"" is a movie i enjoyed as a kid and enjoy as an adult too. I didn't see the english version but i beleive its not that good... there are lots of games with words in the original, like the password at the mouse hq, or almost every characters name... the names are playing with words in hungarian, english, and german, but you must know hungarian to understand those.... like the evil cat ""Teufel"", witch means 'devil' in german, but sounds almost like ""sour cream"" in hungarian... and everyone knows, cats like sour cream ;)
Anyway, its a really good movie.",1046822400,,743,4.593984962406015
7880661,4,6305023743,"This is a fun, well-made movie that certainly deserves more attention. (The elaborate song-and-dance number which introduces us to the villainous rats is a particular highlight.) The animation is not quite as crisp as more mainstream works, and the movie occasionally deals in somewhat dark themes (implied deaths/gruesome violence just off screen, etc.) which probably make it unsuitable for the youngest of viewers, but the comedy works great. Think James Bond on crack - the movie gleefully lampoons every Hollywood cliche in the book!

I don't speak Hungarian, but I'm going to try and hunt down the Hungarian version too - now that I know the plot and have a general idea of the dialogue, I can enjoy 'Macskafogo' the way it was originally intended! (The original Hungarian dub was not included on this DVD, which is the only reason I'm not giving it five stars.)",1440201600,,868,4.945205479452055
7880662,3,6305023743,"I was looking for this DVD long time ago. When I was young I loved the movie and I wanted to watch it together with my husband. But when I last saw it I was around 16 and back then I saw the original hungarian version with excellent casting, different text, different names... This english version didn't take far the same telling effect on the 36 year old of me. I was watching the hungarian version alone.. That was much better. :)",1292716800,3,433,4.2926829268292686
7880663,5,6305023743,"That's a Hungarian movie from the 1980's. I'm not sure how enjoyable it is if you haven't grown up in Hungary. Also I saw it in Hungarian, so I don't know whether the English translation was able to implement the jokes.",1278979200,,219,4.365853658536586
7880664,5,6305023743,"I've only seen Macskafogo in the original Hungarian, and it's hilarious.
The amazon editorial review completely misses the point - it was never meant to be serious or thought-provoking like the White mare's son. It's a light-hearted spy spoof, with good animation, and seriously funny lines (at least in the original) - and yes, it is from the '80s, what's more, from the communist '80s, so it's not exactly a miracle that it has a '70s-'80s feel.

The only reason I can imagine for a seriously bad review is if the English translation is rubbish - for which, admittedly, there is a good chance. A lot of the humour in the original hinges on the language, and I've read a few Hungarian novels (though not seen Hungarian movies) translated to English, and their translation has universally been abysmally bad.

I have actually been looking everywhere for a DVD with *both* English and Hungarian language tracks, or Hungarian with English subtitles. This doesn't seem to be available in or out of Hungary, and I think it's a great pity.
I want to introduce some English-speakers to Hungarian cartoons (and cinema in general, there are some quite good movies), and I don't seem to be able to find subtitled version of anything ... and, after my experience with books, I'm rather scared of how they may be dubbed.

I think I'll give this DVD a shot and see how it is ...",1273190400,,1366,4.683333333333334
7880665,5,6305023743,Hello there. I am a Hungarian 30-year-old guy who was brought up behind the Iron curtain back in the 80s. Therefore I am very grateful for the makers of this masterpiece. Back in the 80s it was impossible to imagine that an animation film can be made with American cooperation. Here's the prove: It could be done. And very well done. This is my all time favourite Hungarian animation film. I just can't be bored of it. And the good news for the fans of the film. In Hungary on December 20th the Cat city continues... The second part's called: Cat City: The cat of the Satan. I hope it will be as good as the first one. The first one is already a cult movie in Hungary and everybody who owns it on DVD is a lucky bastard.!!!! I only can give you one advice: have it as soon as it is available again!,1197676800,,798,4.15483870967742
7880666,5,6305023743,"I grew up with this cartoon, and still find it to be one of my favorites.  I have never seen the english version so I cannot comment on how the voice acting came across.  I have seen most of the animation done by Hungary in the past 30 years and beside Szaffi this is one of the best we have ever produced.  If you are a fan of animation from around the world this is one you should not miss.",1150848000,,392,3.875
7880667,5,6305023743,"review reminds me of a headline from The Onion: 79 Percent Of Americans Missing The Point Entirely. Unless the translation is really bad, it is one of the best cartoons ever made. At least as funny as Shrek.",1133136000,3,207,4.473684210526316
7880668,5,6305023743,"I've always loved this film and I was happy that I've finally found it on DVD in a store in Budapest. This film is an absolute favorite in Hungary and everywhere it has ever been to. I don't really see what the editor of the editorial has against it, he completely misses the point. This film is not trying to be anything. This is a film for itself, and a great one! Enough talking, get your copy and see for yourself!",1132099200,,418,4.172839506172839
7880669,5,6305023743,"Cat City is the greatest achievement of Hungarian animators. It has an action-packed storyline with plenty of humour. This cartoon, Cat City is now a cult classic and an often quoted one. That's not without a reason. The dialogues are brilliantly written and are hilarious, and the characters are likeable.

The original title (Macskafogo) means literally Cat-catcher. According to the story, the cats are planning the extermination of all mice from the planet. However, the mice have a superhero to turn to, a James Bond-like mouse with great physical strength, teeth hard like diamonds, a god sense of humor, and the cleverness of an Einstein.
He is sent to a Japanese-seeming city called Pokio, to get the plans of a new weapon from a mouse scientist. While he is working undercover the mice need another person to draw attention away from him, and this other mouse is also sent to Japan. He is a bit over-weight, but he is a very warm-hearted mouse, who devotes all his time to playing his trumpet. (Unfortunately, though, after a planecrash, he finds himself in the jungle, where he is kidnapped by vampire bats, who also turn out to be music lovers.)
In the meantime, a group of assassin rats are hired to find the mouse agent and kill him.

The cartoon makes use of many clichs of Hollywood movies, making the reader laugh again and again.",1123804800,7,1346,4.772532188841201
7880670,4,6305023743,"I'm a Russian (for a change!) who had seen the translated version of this flick probably 10 times (damn, it was a long time ago). It used to be immensely popular in Russia back in the day, and certain phrases from the translation made it to the street folklore. I haven't seen the English version yet I remember it as a lots-a-fun film. I'm going to get the English version DVD just for old times sake.",1080691200,4,402,4.302631578947368
