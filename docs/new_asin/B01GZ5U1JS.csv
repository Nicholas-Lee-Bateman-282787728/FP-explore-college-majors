With the help of legends like Ron Keel and others, follow the guys as they write and Release their new Bullet in The Chamber E.P. with Ron at the Production helm. A cool E.P. in true 80's Hair Metal style.

The Documentary features great Interviews with various Hair Metal legends such as Ron Keel, Lorraine Lewis, Roxy Petrucci, Lizzy Borden and more. Really cool stuff **** Starz!",1469923200,2,606,4.883495145631068
7771399,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"What a wonderful and thought-provoking documentary. My girlfriend and I watched last night in total awe of the dedication it took to make such a great movie. The project taking so many turns ended up better than what I thought, they thought it was going to be.  I highly recommend you seeing HAIR I GO AGAIN .  I promise you won't be sorry.",1468195200,3,340,4.380952380952381
7771400,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"This movie is very honest, funny, emotional, sharp and inspiring! I am completely blown away by how many of my favorite 80's artists are in this documentary and moved by the strength and struggle these two men shared. Highly recommend!",1468195200,,235,4.9
7771401,5,B01GZ5U1JS,Loved this film!,1468195200,,16,4.666666666666667
7771402,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Excellent film! Hair I Go Again is an entertaining and inspiring indie movie experience.  The documentary is an engaging story of two rockers--of Super Skate fame during the 80s--who long to get the band back together after 30 years.  The movie details their journey with advice from some of the music industry's successful 80s hair metal successes. From Tryxx to Bullet in the Chamber, the boys hope to live the dream!  Good stuff! Rock on, my friends!",1468195200,,453,4.857142857142857
7771403,1,B01GZ5U1JS,"Lame. Lame because all those big name rockstars were PAID to do & say all those things. Ya really think they would help out 2 ""never was"" hacks that can barely remember how to play their instruments.... out of the kindness of their hearts??? Nope. It doesn't work that way, folks... It's never worked that way.",1523404800,2,310,4.553571428571429

7771406,2,B01GZ5U1JS,"I was persuaded by the trailer to purchase this film to stream. It looked quite interesting from the onset; I am a musician & enjoy watching these kinds of documentaries about the ""underdogs."" The Anvil documentary is definitely the best I have seen yet. ""Hair I Go Again"" was not good or interesting to me because it was filled with alot of talk from 2 guys & no action or real movement in the story. Alot of drama that was not relevant to the action (or lack of action) from the story. The best part of the film was the commentary from all the famous 80's rockers (of which there were MANY). The story of these two guys trying to re-live a part of their initial rock'n'roll dream is promising, but this documentary just didn't go anywhere or have a good enough payoff in my opinion.",1515369600,,784,4.376712328767123
7771407,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"A great framed snap shot of an era of Rock n roll that created a lot of legendary events and babies!!

Inside this is a story of the drive and desire to win.

Be sure to catch this ... If you're a product who lived through the 80s do not miss !!",1512950400,,245,3.6923076923076925
7771408,2,B01GZ5U1JS,Kinda sad and depressing,1512864000,,24,5.25
7771409,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Yeah I'm 1 of those old dudes that never had the dream come true but I still have 12 guitars and 6 amps and no hair and really would love to have a time machine. The movie rocks,  it is true and a pretty good laugh. Good",1511913600,,220,3.6808510638297873
7771410,3,B01GZ5U1JS,I enjoyed watching this movie and it was cool to see the guys fulfill their dream...somewhat.,1511740800,,93,4.875
7771411,3,B01GZ5U1JS,"It was good, about an old nobody band trying to put it back together. I won't give it away but...not bad, decent watch",1510704000,,118,4.173913043478261
7771412,3,B01GZ5U1JS,"Fun at first but then something seems very unnatural about the whole situation.  Where are they getting the money to do this film when one guy supposedly lost his house?  Answer: it was crowd funded from inception of the idea.  Ron Keel and Paul Shortino are not going to do this film for ""favors"" from nobodies.  Keel is listed on the credits a few times.  At one point the band admits they are filming shows for the documentary.  doesn't feel genuine at all.  Like being cheated having sat through it.",1509926400,,503,4.522222222222222
7771413,3,B01GZ5U1JS,It's ok. You really have to like 80's metal rock to get into this.,1509235200,,66,3.7857142857142856
7771414,5,B01GZ5U1JS,This movie was inspiring on many levels. These guys not only persevered in realizing at least some of their music career dreams but also made an entertaining film about it and met a lot of their music heros in the process. If you like 80s metal you'll recognize a lot of the people who are interviewed and who help Kyle and Steve along the way. We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and you will too!,1505347200,,395,4.351351351351352
7771415,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"I am not very familiar with the genre of music that this film referenced, however that did not hinder the story from being a compelling one. I think most everyone can relate to growing older and having to take stock in one's life. Having a bucket list is typical for many, but the way these men went about fulfilling a lifelong dream took a lot of guts and was inspiring. Cinematically speaking, what I liked about this film is that there is some grit to it. It's not too clean which really lends itself to the story. I also enjoyed the fact that this was not a typical historical or anecdotal documentation, but rather a real story told in real time. If I were to offer a critique otherwise, it would be in the length of the film as it was a bit ""longish"", particularly in the middle of the movie. Overall better than most documentaries of this genre.",1505347200,,852,4.364779874213837
7771416,1,B01GZ5U1JS,Absolute train wreck.  Save your money.  Not redeeming enough for one star.,1505260800,,75,5.166666666666667
7771417,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"It's one of those movies I will watch many times.  The advice given by the artists throughout the film transcends genres.  It applies to anyone trying to make a go of it in the music business. Even people not in that style of music (my personal favourite), can learn from this the professional musicians in this film; and there's a lot of them!",1505088000,,344,4.444444444444445
7771418,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"As a guitarist from the late 70's to the last decade, I really enjoyed these guys efforts, perseverance and finally their music.  One hell of a metal documentary!!!",1503273600,,164,4.857142857142857
7771419,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Excellent movie, if you ever had that rock n roll dream you should watch this. Thank you for making this for all of us. Good luck in the future. Rent or Buy this movie. Horns up!",1502150400,,178,3.9722222222222223
7771420,5,B01GZ5U1JS,Hell Yeah!  The ending made it all worthwhile,1501804800,2,45,4.625
7771421,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Enjoyable documentary about two guys trying to reform their old unknown 80s hair metal band for one last chance at the brass ring.  There are cameos from lots of notable musicians, producers, and more of the era.  You see them contact former members they haven't spoken to since the band broke up.  You see them struggling to learn their instruments (vocals and guitar) after not playing since 1987.  You see them hook up with Ron Keel, who takes them under his wing (BTW read Ron Keel's book EVEN KEEL... it's great).  All in all this is an enjoyable doc that truly illustrates the importance of not giving up.  Kyle (the singer that looks like Mike Reno (JK)) is a really charismatic guy that has the drive and passion... he really is the heart and soul of the doc.  He makes the movie.  The guitarist seemed a bit out of place.  I mean... if he was ever passionate about being a musician, why didn't he continue playing guitar after the band folded?  I started playing about 1984... have been in several bands... and not being in a band never caused me to stop playing.  He never really shows passion like his bud.  Well... maybe a little.  But I digress.

If you love 80s hard rock... if you liked the recent ANVIL movie... you will probably enjoy this!  Recommended!

Kudos to Peavey, also!!!",1500768000,6,1297,4.54978354978355

7771423,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Read somewhere about this rock documentary and was happy to have found it for sale here on Amazon. Looks like a passion endeavour recreating an 80's (hair) metal band 25 years later. Comical, educational and entertaining all at the same time. Giving us viewers a unique insight into the doings that go on behind the scenes when overaged rockers pretty much try to recreate their heyday.",1490313600,,386,4.863636363636363

7771425,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"In a world filled with reality tv, which everyone  should know is fake, it was refreshing watching a TRUE story for a change.  Kyle and the guys grew up in the same era I did, so the bands and music in this DVD are among my favorites.  I
enjoyed taking this journey with a couple
average ""joes"" as they left their real lives behind
to pursue their rock and roll dreams.  All I can say is (devil horns in the air), ""Long Live Rock and Roll!""",1482364800,3,440,4.0813953488372094

7771427,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Being a rock photog, I frequently interact with many of the rockers in this movie and call a few friends as well. This movie gives us a new perspective on the music biz in general and on the music we all know and love; and will fight to keep alive and vital --- Hair Metal of the 80s!!
Our heroes in this epic adventure of lets get the band back together and take over the world of rock, Kyle & Steve, struggle so hard to make this dream happen, receiving stark advise from some of their favorites in the biz. They experience some awesome highs and some sobering lows along the way but, in the end, some great support for this project overall. The majority of the support comes from the Metal Cowboy himself, Ron Keel.  I, personally, think the original stuff they did sounded great and Id go to see it live. So we hope to see you all playing a festival somewhere soon  maybe in my Central FL area (?)  :-)
Ultimately, this is an awesome movie and well worth the watch for anyone who loves the 80s metal scene and just music in general. The moral of the story is : Never give up on your dreams!!

(Side note: Ive shot 80s in the Park in Melbourne the 4 yrs its been around, saw the Hair I Go Again guys there, wish Id spoke to them a bit more while I was there)  :-)",1474675200,,1266,4.109311740890688
7771428,5,B01GZ5U1JS,A journey of two long time friends in midlife trying to revisit their dream of youth and reunite their band and give things another try.  Very inspiring yet at the same time realistic in several aspects with how life just gets in the and the way the music business runs today complete with highs and lows of the goal and going to plan B...  Some very great words and wisdom from countless named musicians from the 80's/90's hard rock genre and perhaps one of the funniest catch phrases you'll keep in mind for some time.  You may not quite think of Loverboy the same way.  A must see for the hard rock genre fans.  Great documentary...,1474243200,4,635,4.439655172413793

7771431,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"Metal took over more than just the Sunset Strip and so did this movie.

8764317,5,B01GZ5U1JS,"this film is actually inspirational. These guys decided to give up their usual routine to go for their dream.

By the end of the movie, I found myself disliking the original members (especially the singer) and found the 'big show' to feel very staged and not realistic at all.  I'm sure if there was a sequel it would be the same guys still looking for that label deal that would make them the superstars they feel they deserve to be.....",1523750400,,421,4.185185185185185
