2890961,5,B000SUKPGQ,"I have the European Version with red ""King"" Cover and 30 Clips on it. I must say I love this DVD, because it's great to have all of this Clips on one DVD. It makes a lot of fun to watch it.",1194566400,3,189,3.5238095238095237
2890962,1,B000SUKPGQ,"I bought this DVD for the bonus features, the press conferences.
NEITHER ONE OF THEM ARE PRESENTED IN THEIR ENTIRETY!
the first press conference from 1960 is normally 45+ minutes in length, on this DVD you get just over 2 minutes of it and that is poorly edited!
You can get the entire press conference on the Graceland tour video, available through the official Elvis catalog or website.
The New York Madison Square Garden Press conference 1972 normally runs 20+ minutes, but on this DVD, you only get just over 6 minutes,
and it is presented in a ""rough cut"" form
I have been looking for an unedited version of this particular press conference on video/DVD for years, I thought that I had found it on this release, no where on this DVD, does it state that the bonus features are edited or shortened, so you think that you are getting the full unedited versions, WRONG!
The M.S.G. press conference footage presented here is also available on the DVD,

as well as several other DVD releases and on those, you get more minutes of footage.
You would think that since this is an official release, you would get better quality and that they would at least mention that the bonus features are not presented in their entirety, not so.
All of the other clips on Elvis #1 Hit Performances are readily available on other (much better) RCA-EPE video releases and the average Elvis fan, most likely already has them in their collection, so unless you are new to the Elvis world, AVOID THIS RELEASE!!!...
It was designed for the mass market, ""nothing"" new here!",1193961600,15,1747,5.133333333333334
2890963,2,B000SUKPGQ,"For Elvis fans...this appears to be very fun..a nice collection of clips from old TV appearances and Movies and the TWO BONUS press conferences are absolutely essential.  My huge complaint is that the clips from the movies and concert films are presented FULL FRAME..and cropped pretty severely in some cases (like Jailhouse Rock which was a very widescreen film). If you don't mind the cropping of picture then give it an extra couple of stars and enjoy!

REVIEW UPDATE!!
this is now available in the UK (amazon.co.uk) as an NTSC release..with a HUGE exception...it has 30 clips!!! plus the same two bonus features...
its  TWICE the material!!!  They call it ""ELVIS the king of Rock N Roll"" and has the gold sticker on the front with the #1's logo....",1193702400,21,752,4.8062015503875966

2890968,5,B000SUKPGQ,"Product was delivered timely far before Christmas. It was a gift for my mom.  She loved it, we watched it together and it was a good documentary of Elvis and the progression of his career. I enjoyed it as much as my mother who is a huge Elvis fan.  Great historical recording of Elvis throughout his career.",1326844800,,307,4.368421052631579

2890970,5,B000SUKPGQ,I absolutely love this DVD! I have watched it over and over again. I wasn't alive to see Elvis perform so this gives me a chance to see whatever it was he did that drew an audience. I would recommend this DVD to any true Elvis fan. A must have in your collection!,1279238400,,263,3.981132075471698
2890971,2,B000SUKPGQ,"The folks at RCA dropped the ball on this one. When considering the extensive amount of Presley footage, ""Elvis #1 Hit Performances"" is a half-hearted, slapdash effort. The DVD exists as a sampler for the uninitiated, with poorly edited ""bonus material."" If RCA had any integrity, they would pull this release off the market and start from scratch.",1209168000,17,348,5.017241379310345
2890972,3,B000SUKPGQ,"DVD is OK; it is a re-hash of some of his early performances.
Many are in B&W, or colorized.
All the music is not enhanced, NO stereo sound.
If you want to see Elvis in his original performances from the 1950's and 1960's, it is fine.
There are 15 songs on the disc.",1203897600,,266,4.037735849056604
2890973,3,B000SUKPGQ,"Well, the quality is not the best.  However if you wish a little sample of the king's performances this is the DVD.",1197072000,2,115,4.2272727272727275
