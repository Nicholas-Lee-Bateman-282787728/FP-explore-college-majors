3589332,4,B001FWRYVK,"This DVD is a show on the evolution of the 1960's Underground movement in England. It involves many artists from rock & roll bands, poets, drawing artists, to the writers and the young adults (15 to 30) of the time that drove the movement. Also the effect of the Vietnam war on the thinking of the time (early 1960's). Just what Psychedelic ideology did blossom, how LSD is a part and not a part, and why Psychedelic ideas blossomed in culture is explored through many insightful interviews. So it is a great teaching aid!

What this is not is a representation of any particular band's history and/or performances. The band, The Pink Floyd, is said to be the center piece of the so called UFO club. Their history is discussed but the are better films documenting that.

Interstellar Overdrive by ""The Pink Floyd"" in discussed in detail just how the band with Syd Barrett formed this song. From there, the band's history is explored and is the focus of the interviews (as well as Syd Barrett's history) in detail of the time period.

Bonus section has fuller versions of songs.

The English underground is said in this film to be driven by The Beat movement of the 1950's & early 1960's. Allan Ginsberg (Howl)(Appearance in 1962 in England)), Aldous Huxley (The Doors to Perception), are mentioned in detail on the Beatnik ideal. 1967, when Syd lost it on stage in the USA, is explored. David Gilmore does not appear in the actual film part.

Some Paul McCartney archive footage of his commentary at the time is featured too.
So as a documentary of the English Underground and the idea of the UFO club, the film gets 5 stars. But as a strict History of bands at the time, the film deserves 2 or 3 starts.

3589333,5,B001FWRYVK,"As a fierce, die-hard Pink Floyd fan, it was awesome to see NEW interview clips with Roger Waters and Nick Mason in this documentary. It was extra special to also see their longer COMPLETE interviews as BONUS material on this DVD! Unfortunately, in the hippie days, the film crew at the Technicolor Dream concert left before Pink Floyd played, but this documentary covers the whole 24-hour party with interesting stories, gossip, and fond memories.",1241049600,2,448,5.0675675675675675
3589334,2,B001FWRYVK,"Well, I purchased this DVD in hopes that the Floyd performances would include previously unknown footage.
Sadly, that turned out to not be the case.
There are some lengthy interviews with Roger Waters and Nick Mason, as well as Joe Boyd and a couple of other guys, and those were interesting, and they also went on at some length about Syd Barrett.
The Floyd performances, however, are easily available through unofficial channels in more complete form, and without the top and bottom of the picture chopped off to make fake 16:9 aspect ratio.
This footage, however, has been cleaned up, so it is likely to be the highest quality version of it that you can get, but (for some unknown reason) the producers chose to edit out all of the Hans Keller (the jerk who asks ""Why has it got to be so loud?"") interview with Syd, Roger, Nick, and Rick.
This could have gotten extra points from me, even though it contains footage found elsewhere, if they had not chopped off the aspect ratio, and if they had made the footage complete.
Sorry, guys, but I rate this nothing more than a C-.
Amazon, for their part, were exemplary, as always.
I had to get a reshipment because the USPS lost the first shipment.
Amazon rapidly sent out another, and I had it in my hands within four days of reporting the missing first shipment.",1228262400,18,1312,4.563559322033898

8302809,5,B001FWRYVK,this film follows the 60s London underground movement specifically a show that was a benefit for the London School of Free Thought called the 14 hour Technicolor Dream witch had lots of bands but of course the headliner was the Sid Berreit era Pink Floyd. There is live footage of Astromony Domine & Scarecrow.,1394323200,,310,4.7592592592592595
8302810,4,B001FWRYVK,"There are six or eight movies with Pink Floyd interviews that depict Syd Barrett as this creative genius gone astry with the medicine chest, but only one movie (""A Technicolor Dream"")gives deep context of significance around Syd's contemporary artists at that given point in time (1965-6)in the Notting Hill section of London. A very specific sliver on rock and modern culture.

8302811,3,B001FWRYVK,"A TECHNICOLOR DREAM is a 2008 documentary of 1960s youth culture that culminates in the 14 Hour Technicolour Dream, a London fundraising concert held on April 29, 1967 that marked a certain milestone in the British counterculture. It is essentially two films in one. One strand is the history of the counterculture in general. The other strand is the early history of Pink Floyd, whom the filmmakers call the ""house band of the underground"" and who played a set at the 14 Hour Technicolour Dream.

To paint a portrait of the London underground, there are interviews with such people as John ""Hoppy"" Hopkins, Barry Miles, Kevin Ayers (of the band Soft Machine) and Phil May (of The Pretty Things). Their reminisces start with the C&D movement of the early 1960s, proceed through the massive poetry reading of Allen Ginsberg and others at the Albert Hall in early 1965, the establishment of the London Free School, the launch of the International Times and the UFO club, and finally the organization of the Technicolour Dream for IT's legal defence. We go no further than 1967, as several people interviewed felt that by the end of that year, the counterculture had grown too commercial.

For the history of Pink Floyd, there are interviews with Roger Waters, Nick Mason and their first manager Peter Jenner. While they mostly discuss the talents of Syd Barrett and his ultimate descent into mental illness, the interviews do touch on some other themes as well. Roger Waters says right out that he wasn't in tune with the idealism of the age, he just wanted to be a big rock star with the perks that it brought. Nick Mason is less forthcoming about anything, really.

Both fans of Pink Floyd and those interested in the London counterculture will find this an entertaining documentary. However, almost everything here can be found elsewhere in greatest detail. Even the contemporary footage comes from early documentaries. Also, for viewers who already know quite a bit about the history of the counterculture, the lack of any interview with Jim Haynes (one of the founders of IT and the Arts Lab) is a big gap.",1347408000,,2109,4.852777777777778
