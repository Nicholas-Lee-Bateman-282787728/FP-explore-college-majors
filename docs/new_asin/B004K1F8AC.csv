4392157,5,B004K1F8AC,"1978 VERSION:Having made such an unsurpassable monster of a movie, it is no surprise that Meir Zarchi, after only one other film(rumoured to be disappointing), called it a day. This is a movie which has everything, even the lack of music shows how strong everything else is. You get extra scenic footage in glorious color at the beginning with this original compared to the later one. The only gripe I have is that the cover gives it away that the girl survives, part of the excitement of these sort of horrorflicks is wondering if the main character is going to make it. The compensation I suppose is that dudes can now watch both films and then decide which chick they would rather take swimming. Both girls are 10s but my nod would just go to Butler although Keaton looks otherworldly good in those bikinis. This is one of the original revenge movies and has always been highly rated by discerning moviegoers. The colors are very lush and the scenery is real eye candy, and one of the reasons the sparse music doesnt matter is because the girl and the roughnecks act so well. The interiors and exteriors are really tasteful, with the antique telephones and typewriters highlighting the various timeless period details. The church scene comes in at exactly the right time and confirms Zarchis superb use of varying locations. The rape scenes in both films are well staged and stop before they get boring. The revenge scenes in this one are not as bloody as in the 2011 film, but Keaton always knows exactly how to make the camera like her, even when the low lifes are chasing her through sodden wet wooded areas before she resumes planning her strategy to the strains of Puccini. She is really very physically gifted in this film. No complaints about the Bluray it enhances the original dvds color, and I didn't notice any differences to that excellent Elite dvd. 16/9 region A classified NR.  2011 VERSION:Its straight into the main course here, and this film is less good-looking than the original but makes up for it with even more realistic special effects. The scenery is greyer and the properties and interiors less attractive. The acting and direction of the players is well competent, and to be fair this movie does strive to be visually different to the original, so the critiscism I have just made might be unfair. When I watched these films after each other, as you can do because of their visual differences, I eventually found Butler marginally more physically attractive, not that Keaton isn't a 10 also, but thats just my opinion. I thought the louts in this version more threatening because they are quieter, but the Sheriff is definitely of the John Baxter school of sheriffing. Once again the protagonists pursue each other through wet woodland, but this lot of males turn out to be even more stupid, repeatedly refusing to see what God gave them eyes for. The Bluray is so good that at times it lifts the color to the levels of the original. There really is so much to watch in both movies. 2.35 region A classified NR. Interesting extras for both movies.",1349481600,,3076,4.717472118959108
4392158,4,B004K1F8AC,I was around in the 70's but never saw this movie.....too busy I guess. I do not like horror movies but I was curious about the revenge factor here.  WOW! You won't fall asleep during this movie.,1338595200,3,195,4.27027027027027
4392159,4,B004K1F8AC,We bought the double feature and watched both back to back.  The remake was surprisingly enjoyable.  Normally I find  remakes lacking but in this case it had a few laughable moments especially a few death scenes.  The remake looks a bit more polished but I still find it difficult to believe she survived on what she did.  The original doesn't skip time like the remake does and the set of the original feels a bit more isolated to me for some reason.  Both were enjoyable and interesting to watch and compare.  It is also nice having both in one case.  The special features include commentary and interviews which were ok but nothing I found jaw droppingly interesting.  We got two descent movies for a good price and in one package so we are happy!,1334707200,16,750,4.537313432835821

4392175,3,B004K1F8AC,"The only good reason to do a re-make is to make a better movie than the original. The original is superior to the remake. Siskel & Ebert were wrong in thinking that the original movie promoted or encouraged rape. Only an already degenerate mind would side with the rapists against Jennifer Hills. I don't agree that no jury would convict her, (per the promotion) however, since she let all her wounds heal and did not bring her condition right after the assault to the authorities when it happened (the audience doesn't count.) There is little question that she would be convicted if she were caught. The re-make did not walk the tightrope of making the revenge ""deserving"" of the crime in the revenge-movie sense. It lessened the brutality of the rape (more humiliation than brutality for the most part) and then went over-the-top with the savagery of the revenge. The victim, new Jennifer, then becomes far worse than the original criminals, more of an extremely sadistic killer in her own right. Not too clear how she could have escaped the river, gotten new clothes that fit her. If she is the one who stole the tape why didn't she turn it in to the authorities? Why did the Sheriff, logically, want to destroy the tape, but not prevent the taping in the first place?  Yes, there does need to be some logic even in a revenge picture.",1446508800,4,1337,4.641350210970464

4392198,1,B004K1F8AC,"Joe Bob Briggs, grindhouse movie guru and all-around funny guy, says on this movie's commentary track that the original I Spit On Your Grave is actually a feminist film in favor of women's rights--or that you can at least argue the point. I have to disagree.

The movie seems to follow the age-old cliche that women are hysterical creatures who can't control their violent passions. No matter how much a woman may claim otherwise, no matter how poised and controlled she may appear on the surface, sooner or later the ""crazy bitch"" inside will break her way out.

Director/writer Meir Zarchi subjects his female protagonist (played by Camille Keaton) to endless amounts of abuse until finally she cracks and becomes more violent and bloodthirsty than her assailants. Along the way, she tries to control her urges and reverse her degeneration only to collapse into total violence at the end of the movie. Her transformation from prissy, stuck-up city girl to bikini-wearing, blood-smeared, axe-wielding lunatic is complete. Just another crazy bitch, as some might say.

A true feminist movie would show her controlling her anger and fury. She would have gone back to the city. She would have reported her experience to the police. She might have organized women's groups to fight for her cause and also to represent other female victims of rape. The point is she would have proven herself better than her assailants precisely by controlling the same emotions that her assailants can't control within themselves.

Fortunately, this movie is so poorly made that you can't take its attitudes seriously. But the attitudes expressed in it are very offensive, just the same.",1408233600,,1667,5.072992700729927

It seems that many films emerged within the vengeance/slasher/snuff films after the Manson Family murders, The Last House on the Left etc, this film so they are basically cheap exploitation films feeding off the headlines of the times. I actually like the remake better than the original, and the only real strong point about the original is the actress, who is quite good looking... but her manner of murdering her attackers are quite uncreative and anti-climactic, the remake is much better but at least the protagonist's actions are more theatric and spitefull.
