2283707,5,B0009ESSF6,Very good movie with some funny and strange turns of events that could really happen.  Not like so much of the movies today,1338940800,,123,4.3478260869565215
2283708,4,B0009ESSF6,"This movie was a must own for me. I haven't seen many National Lampoon/gross out comedy type movies lately, but this one would be one of them. I remember just catching the last scene of this movie on a Canadian cable channel called Drive-In. This channel is no longer in service due to low viewership which is a shame. But, anyway the last scene was one of the sexiest I've seen in a movie in a long time. It involved one of the girls that the guys picked up while they were holding out their thumbs.

 When I received this movie from amazon I immediatly watched it from the beginning and happily I wasn't disappointed. I know myself that I barely ever laugh out loud at a movie ,but this one did it to me more than five times throughout. Of course my favorite part was still that last scene of the girl and guy up on the cliff right before the credits roll, but the movie was great as a whole as well.

 It had a Canadian vibe to it which was neat since not a whole lot of comedies do. Some of the locations visited by the characters I myself have been a patron of as well once upon a time. This movie stands up to many of the better teen oriented comedy films of the last twenty some years. I would easily recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh hard.",1315785600,,1255,4.131147540983607
2283709,3,B0009ESSF6,"brief plot outline:  buckle your seat belts for extreme comedy- National Lampoon is taking you on the road!  In the bawdy tradition of ""American Pie"" and ""Eurotrip"", this rapid-fire funfest is the ultimate coming-of-age experience, where the rules get broken, and the laughs come a mile a minute!

When three hard-up high school grads jump in an RV and skip town, they have no idea it's going to be the most outrageous ride of their lives!  Encountering every kind of cross-country craziness- from meeting beautiful hitchhikers and Avril Lavigne to running afoul of the law, two brutal bar babes and a bigwig on the music scene (Jason Priestly)- these helplessly hedonistic horn-dogs are in for the ultimate education!",1307145600,,718,5.059322033898305
2283710,1,B0009ESSF6,"this was the biggest waste of four bucks and two hours i have ever spent. national lampoon movies are supposed to be classically funny, and even though this seemed teen-movie genre (in the american pie tradition), i thought it would be fun to have playing in the background while i worked on an art project.
not only is this NOT funny and NOT sexy, the movie is completely pointless and the characters boring/trite.
i'm a bit too young to wish for the chevy chase days of national lampoon, but i can say that i feel this movie was a disgrace in representing my generation. & based on watching this, i will probably never rent another national lampoon movie w/o chase in it.",1213056000,,673,4.524590163934426
2283711,3,B0009ESSF6,"A fun movie. Could just as well have been a fun movie of the week. The old ""uncontrollable sex-crazed youth"" has been done to death. A little too much of it in this movie. There were a few disgusting parts (of the movie, I mean), but I guess that is a matter of taste. There is one part at the dinner table, with the farmer and his daughter, that goes beyond the pale. Using the dinner prayer , while the daughter ""does her thing"" kind of soiled the enjoyment for me.  Having said that, a lot of beautiful people trapse up to Canada so the one star crossed ex-virgin can propose to his snobby snooty girlfriend. The sabatoge attempts were ok, but one of the enjoyable parts was that of the characters who played Chritopher Jacots' parents. They did not have enough screentime in this campy yet enjoyable, forgettable movie.

The adventers, comedic forays, with just the right amount of ""he should be  with this girl, not the one he thinks he is in love with"" made me give this movie barely a -3-. If I can edit out one part, this is a keeper.",1191369600,2,1042,4.333333333333333
2283712,3,B0009ESSF6,"National Lampoons has always had the ability to put out mixed films. Some are good stupid and some are too stupid to even sit through like their genius movie Adam and Eve, which I turned off after 10 minutes. Here comes Going the distance which actually has some notable moments but most of them I can't write on Amazon. Going the Distance is about a teen named Nick who looks more like a 29 year old. Nick just got a special gift from his girlfriend on the night before she goes off to Toronto to intern for a slimy record executive who likes to take advantage of young interns. His girl doesn't tell him until the next day and Nick has no choice but to let her go.

A few hours later Nick decides to fly to Toronto and ask her to marry him but not before his friends and parents (who absolutely hate his girlfriend) force nick to have a few going away drinks. Somehow Nick's mom slips him something to make him pass out and when Nick wakes up he is in his trailer and his friends surprise him by taking a road trip to Toronto.  This movie is actually enjoyable but it could be way better if they picked a couple of better actors. Christopher Jacot playing the lead character Nick doesn't really fit him. I actually would have liked to seen Ryan Reynolds play Nick but he probably had better things to do. Chris was a dry actor for a National Lampoon film and he drops the films worth. The supporting characters were ok but you can feel the need for one more crazy character to boost the movies excitement. There wasn't enough funny stuff going on in this movie, just a little here and a little there. Going the distance is worth seeing if you have nothing else to do and nothing else to watch and you'll definitely get a few laughs, especially on the farmer's table scene.",1165190400,3,1774,4.324324324324325
2283713,4,B0009ESSF6,"Well, I for one really liked this movie. It is like a canadian version of Road Trip, and the characters are pretty cliche, especially tyler, but other than that I really liked it! Lots of good scenery and good laughs. I really think you should buy this movie",1153440000,2,258,4.395833333333333
2283714,2,B0009ESSF6,"This is as bad as Out Cold. I think most viewers, even if they just want dumb fun, will find this movie insulting to their intelligence. I guess maybe it's just a movie to watch while drinking with friends. Your brain would have to be completely turned off to be entertained by it. It's template derived, an endless string of cliches. The kind of script that draws inspiration from other movies rather than from real life or a creative imagination. The basic plot outline of a guy making an emergency trip across the country to save his relationship, while falling for another girl in the process, is ripped off of Road Trip who ripped it off of Overnight Delivery. Only in this movie instead of the other girl being wilder and broadening the guy's horizons she's more conservative, I guess a testament to the conservative mentality behind this film. The added bit of having to save the girlfriend from a sleazy record executive type = Wayne's World. The picking up girls who subject the unwitting guy to violent bondage = Tomcats. The popsickle scene was the only remotely clever part. If it was just the girl licking the popsickle seductively to tease the boy it would be really dumb, but because the guy was doing it too it had a certain inane random charm to it that I liked.
It's pretty tragic to think that hundreds of people spent months working on this. The only real problem is the script. It's a professional looking movie as far as the actors and cameras go, but it's all wasted effort because of the weak script. It's like building a mansion on a sinkhole.",1137628800,,1568,4.5836298932384345
2283715,3,B0009ESSF6,"I'm not too fond of National Lampoon's films, but this one was actually a Canadian film first. It's not bad. You have your average breasts and gross-out sexual humor (a staple of any teen sex comedy) In the end it's sweet and has a heart. Avril Lavigne's cameo is horrible, and as an American, I enjoyed seeing the sights of Canada.",1126310400,11,332,4.459016393442623

8059554,5,B0009ESSF6,Its a road trip movie across Canada.  I loved it because it was different.  there is a little gross humor which is typical of National Lampoon's movies.  I purchased it after getting it on Netflix DVD a while ago then renting it on amazon instant after that.,1434240000,,258,4.446808510638298
8059555,5,B0009ESSF6,"One of the best Lampoons withoit Chevy Chase. This is the story of a guy who loses his virginity and then falls in love & his parents do not approve. The guy drives to Canada to get his gf back from the cheap sleeze that she works for. They come across so much crazy stuff,strippers,fights,paintball,and stuff i cant mention. The parents sabotage the trip with a guy on their tail to get them to stop. Funny.funny stuff. Hilarious from start to finish. Must watch it is awesome and such beautiful scenery and beautiful girls.
