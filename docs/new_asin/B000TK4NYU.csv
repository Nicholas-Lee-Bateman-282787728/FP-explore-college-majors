Highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour who doesn't mind some-one who is outrageously politically incorrect.  Our school teachers were like that years ago, which is refreshing in our Nanny country.  Watch it!!!!",1331769600,,300,4.730769230769231
8209878,5,B000TK4NYU,"This is a brilliantly funny, fantastically observed character study and satire of the New Zealand education system, but don't worry, you don't have to be a New Zealander to get the jokes.  The characters we see, for all their exageration, are real enough to be universal.  The easily offended will be put off by its political incorrectness, but the program offends only to be true to its characters.  Buy this!  Rent this!  Just see it!  (However, don't bother with series 2, by which time the edge has gone, as has the humour).",1251590400,,528,4.684782608695652
