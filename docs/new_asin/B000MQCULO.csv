2738734,5,B000MQCULO,A very good HD DVD about a certain prides of Lions on an Island off the coast of Africa.  Covers the daily life concerning the lions relentless pursuit of their predominate prey - water buffalos.

2738735,5,B000MQCULO,"The first true nature documentary to be released on HD formats and, boy, is it excellent!

This is a 90-minute documentary on a pride of lions and their buffalo prey trapped on an island in the Okavango delta. There is an extrememly informative narrative throughout the whole program with some fascinating moments.

The picture is truly amazing in HD. You can see every hair on the lion's mane, every fly buzzing around a buffalo, and every blade of grass concealing the hunters. Incredible.

The sound is an achievement, too. You've got to have surround sound for this. The bellows of the lions, the grunts of the buffalo, and the laughs of the hyenas surround you and immerse you in Africa completely!

And the narration by Jeremy Irons is worth the price alone.

If you have a Blu-ray player, this is a must-buy! I absolutely loved it!",1175040000,36,838,4.712328767123288

2738749,5,B000MQCULO,"This is a movie about lions that are facing a unique group of buffalo that adapted to challenge and confront lions rather than run from them. With lions used to pray running for them, their mid set has to change to encounter a pray that fights back. As for the technical aspects of the movie itself, i.e. the clarity of the scenes, the clarity is superb.

2738767,5,B000MQCULO,"I found ""Relentless Enemies"" to be uninspiring. There is nothing exciting about lioness out of their normal element, looking very awkward running through deep swamps. This movie is about a certain lioness pride that specializes in hunting water buffalo. This movie looks real on blu-ray, but that's not good enough to carry this movie because, the content is lacking excitement. It's mostly a lot of jockeying to get the upper-hand, between the lionesses chasing the buffalo, and the buffalo chasing the lionesses.

I was very surprised to see the fear in the lionesses, they were scared, intimidated, chased away from their buffalo kill. Chased away by five Laughing Hyenas, who are masters of intimidation. I did get a sense that lioness and hyena's dislike each other, because they are at the top of the African food chain. They both are capable of killing the other if given the chance.

This documentary Relentless Enemies features nothing else, the movie producers found nothing else of value to shoot while in Africa, except this alleged lioness vs buffalo rivalry. The viewers never get a chance to see any other African animals, because this is all they focus on in this documentary. The movie producers, writers, movie camera crew, stick to the script, of lionesses chasing buffalo and nothing else.",1309305600,,1309,5.055555555555555
2738768,5,B000MQCULO,"This documentary is a very well done look at the lives and struggles of two magnificent species: the ""swamp cats"" and the Cape buffalo of the Okavango Delta in Africa.  It is such an epic and timeless struggle for survival as the lions try to find food for themselves and their cubs and the buffalo fiercely protect their herd and calves from the onslaught of attacks that seem to always be coming.  At 90 minutes in length, I really felt like I was immersing myself in their world and with the excellent narrative written by Derek Joubert and dramatically read by Jeremy Irons, I felt like I was viewing a vast drama as it played itself out on the flooded swamps of the Okavango. I could have watched it for several hours. Picture quality and sound are excellent, with bright colors and amazing clarity whether you are viewing an Oxpecker on the back of a buffalo or the bloody whiskered face of a magnificent lioness after a hard fought for kill.  I would not allow the kids to watch this as there are quite a few heart wrenching moments as the lions take down a buffalo calf and there is one scene involving a dead lion cub, but anyone who is into nature, wildlife, or Africa should purchase this Blu Ray A.S.A.P.

However, if you are intersted in what's the show is all about, then this documentary disappoints tremendously. It is all about lions killing buffaloes, FROM A LION'S VIEWPOINT.

It shows ""cute"" little lion cubs learning how to hunt, etc and the way the narrative and the shots are made, it will surely endear you to them. BUT THERE ARE NO SIMILAR SCENES OF BUFFALO CALVES. In fact, the repeated scenes of LIONS KILLING BUFFALO CALVES becomes quite sickening after a while.

The narrator said that the lions are there to cull the old, sick and dying buffaloes. BUT ALL I COULD SEE WERE LIONS KILLING YOUNG HEALTHY BUT VULNERABLE BUFFALO CALVES.

They are about a third larger than ordinary lions and muscularly built to take down their large prey. They take to the water like they were made for it, going after their only prey, the water buffalo. This documentary makes no apologies and can be upsetting to youngsters or the lily livered in its unrestrained delivery.

The close-up scenes are okay but the long shots are as blurry as 90's movies. Night scenes are grainy but not so bad that you will feel like skipping the chapter. The gap between two chapters could be shorter as well. So, in the end, if you already have it in SD, then HD not really worth it.

2738836,5,B000MQCULO,"First of all, make sure your HD DVD player is running the latest firmware otherwise you will probably not be able to view this disc. My HD-A2 gave an error code until I updated it, then the movie played flawlessly.

I've always enjoyed nature documentaries but this one is of special interest to me since it features lions. And you will see plenty of them: lions sleeping, eating, stalking, playing. The water buffalo is the prey on the menu, and you will see them face off against the lion prides. The video quality is superb, you will see detail in the HD version that the normal DVD cannot come close to approaching. Also forget the blocky, compressed video you see on Discovery Theater HD, this disc is of noticeably higher quality. The audio is also surprisingly nice for a documentary, it won't push the limits of your surround system but it will immerse you in the environment that you see on screen.",1199318400,,907,4.598765432098766

2738838,1,B000MQCULO,This Product is terrible. Do not order this if you have an Xbox 360 HDDVD Player or Toshiba HDDVD Player. It makes them freeze and stop loading correctly and then eventually Says CANNOT READ DISC!  I would much rather have had bought a Blu-ray version of this and have sill not watched it. I sent a letter to amazon and then recieved another copy of the same HDDVD. I do not recomend this product to anyone. I have spent alot of money getting HDDVD as they have first come out instead of waiting for the price to drop and this is what I get. I have downloaded every update and spent hours on the phone trying to solve the problem and there isn't one. I have since this problem boughten blu-ray because of this and will hopfully be getting this product on that format. But I feel stupid spending so much money for nothing. Dont make my mistake DON BUY THIS MOVIE IN HDDVD FORMAT!!,1199059200,4,879,4.327272727272727
2738839,1,B000MQCULO,"I used a mail order rental service to get this movie and it wouldn't play on my xbox 360 HD-DVD player.

Some say that they have problem reading the disc.  Nothing wrong with mine copy for sure.  I have Toshiba HD A-30.  Again great picture and great discount price (Bought BOGO Deal) Thanks Amazon.",1198108800,,488,4.415730337078652
2738841,4,B000MQCULO,"I just received this disc through one of Amazon's special offers. I was very skeptical to purchase it because of reviews concerning compatibility with Toshiba's HD-A2 player. I have the newest firmware for the player (2.7/T23M) at this time, and it plays flawlessly.

If you have an old firmware on your player (check by going into setup> general> maintenance> update), then you need to update to improve the player's functionality. There are 3 ways to update the firmware: (a)the ethernet port (b)an iso image update that can be burned to cd (c)request it from toshiba. The firmware update takes a LONG time, so I prefer option b over a, that way I know the update is complete when installation begins, eliminating possible problems from a dropped connection.

THE REVIEW:
Well, now about the actual content of the disk. First of all, the film features lions in real world situations - this is not the ""Lion King"" from Disney. It is not something you may want to watch with young children. This is lions, fighting for survival. These lions do not kill for fun, so this is not violence like what you witness in Hollywood films. I was enlightened as to the dangers that lions face, even though they are predators with great skill and power.

The picture quality is excellent. There is some grain in shady areas, but this is something that usually happens in darker scenes of most films. All in all, if you love nature specials and aren't afraid to experience the violence that is survival in nature, then this hddvd is well worth the purchase.",1198108800,,1542,4.746268656716418

2738853,1,B000MQCULO,I've actually had Netflix send me this twice and neither disc would play on my Toshiba HD DVD player.  I thought it might be just screwed up rental disks but obviously there is a manufacturing problem with a large number of these if the number of reviewers who say they don't play is representative of the larger user base.,1196467200,2,323,4.47457627118644
2738854,5,B000MQCULO,I hear great things about this movie. Be warned though. Relentless Enemies will not play on any of 4 different Xbox360 HD-DVD players we've tested it on. They all have the latest updates from Microsoft and still will NOT play this disc. Shame on the manufacturers for such lousy quality control.

2738856,5,B000MQCULO,"I watched this when it first aired on National Geographic so I can say this looks amazing... too bad I couldn't watch it on HD because my 360 HD player won't play it.  Speaking of... many reviews for this video state that they have the HD-A2... yet some work and some don't... so which HD player should I go with to get the best results?

Back to the review, and this will be based on the standard version I saw, the video was actually pretty awesome.  Even the sound was awesome.  I have no doubt that the surround sound and HD picture will look even more amazing on HD DVD.

Until you buy a player that you know will read the disc, I would say avoid buying it.
If you have something that works (many on here say the HD-A2), then by all means, go get this because it's definitely worth it.",1191715200,,790,4.171052631578948

2738860,5,B000MQCULO,"This is one of the best lion documentaries I have ever seen, the Jouberts have done it again. Several giant-sized powerfully built lionesses have specialized in hunting buffalo, massive bulls and newborn calves alike. The buffalo are equally dangerous defending their own. If you enjoy real world wildlife battles as opposed to fake, computer generated conflict this film is for you. The notorious hyenas make a cameo appearance but the lions aren't all that concerned about them. The angry faces of the lionesses are hilarious at times. And a dark side of lion life is exposed.

The commentary can be turgid and overwrought, but the cinematography is superb and the music complements the action well.",1190505600,15,701,5.095652173913043

2738887,5,B000MQCULO,"Let me begin by saying that those people who gave this HD DVD a bad review should really have their comments removed by Amazon, or at least change their comments to the appropiate hardware.
IT'S NOT THE DISC THAT WAS THE PROBLEM, ITS YOUR PLAYER!!!!!!
I almost didn't get this HDDVD because of you. Inappropriate or misapplied comments ruin things for everyone.
Are you kidding me? This movie is wonderfully shot, the close ups are in HD quility (it was filmed in HD not a transfer from standard def). It shows a pride of lions that specialize in buffalos, yet there is more to it than that. There was a rival lion pride that invades the territory, 1 lion took on a buffalo head on!!! A traitor!!! WOW! truly a great film. And the Cheetah extra is a superb bonus!
Yes, I needed an firmware update for my player, but my hd-a2 updated in minutes. I called tech support and they guided me through it, piece of cake!",1183939200,7,912,4.434523809523809
2738888,4,B000MQCULO,"The main documentary on this disc has lots of great footage of a couple of lion prides hunting, feeding on and sparring with a large herd of buffalo in their territory.
The film could best be described as a docu drama in that a story is told - of the struggle between the pride of lions and this herd - and the commentary is sometimes dramatised too much for my liking.
It is a very interesting film nonetheless and will not only leave you more familiar with the day-to-day activities of a pride of lions, but also leave you with an insight into the precarious balance of nature as we watch these lions' existence.

The extras on this disc also include a short documentary about the Cheetah, with a cameraman and his guide following a mother and her cubs around as she hunts and looks after her cubs.

The PQ (picture quality) is very good in both docus, especially taking into account the difficulties of filming some of the footage we get to see. Together with Planet Earth, this is a good addition to your HD DVD nature documentary library.

On a final note, this disc plays fine on the Toshiba HD-XA2 with firmware 2.0",1183766400,5,1122,4.463414634146342
2738889,5,B000MQCULO,"Having both the SD DVD and the HD(Blu-ray) DVD versions, I can say without a doubt that the detail in HD is fantastic with the clouds of flies that surround the buffalos being clearly obvious. The detail of the Lions is such that you feel they are in the room with you. The program is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your chair for the whole 90min duration. Who will win? as the tables are turned time and time again, the buffalos or the lions? Expertly filmed and narrated. In 5.1 Dolby Digital audio, so the sound is also fantastic.
As it is Region Free, this BD DVD can be enjoyed worldwide.
A must for wildlife fans.
The HD(Blu-ray) format is really suited to wildlife/nature programs, and hopefully a lot more wildlife programs in this format will be available soon.",1182297600,9,777,4.47887323943662
