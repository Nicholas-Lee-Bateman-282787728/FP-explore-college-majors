2279751,5,B0009E322K,"Well while Gilligan only lasted three seasons the fact that there is 98 episodes makes it four or even almost 5 seasons in today's shortened TV seasons.  Gilligan's staying power is really quite amazing considering it had no real major actors, no actors who went on to become larger stars, and was a borderline kid's show.  But this screwball comedy with the improbable plots and the professor building hi-tech items out of coconut cream pies is just darn funny.  The best episodes are always those where it looks like the castaways will be rescued until Gilligan screws it up again.

My Favorite episodes from season three are:

""Up at Bat""  Gilligan is bitten by a bat and thinks that he is going to become a vampire.

""The Producer"" This is one of my favorites as the great Phil Silvers guest stars as director Harold Hecuba lands on the island.

""Ring Around Gilligan"" famous 60's and 70's character actor Vito Scotti guest stars as a mad scientist who uses his rings to hypnotize the castaways.

""The Kidnapper""  Don Rickles guest stars as a gambler and thief who kidnaps the women.

""Gilligan Goes Gung Ho""  Gilligan is made sheriff of the island and ends up throwing everyone in jail.

""Our Vines have Tender Apes"" An Actor (Denny Miller) who is practicing for a movie part convinces the castways that he is a Tarzan-like jungle man.

""Gilligan's personal Magnetism""  A lightning strike cause a bowling ball to get stuck on Gilligan's hand.

""The Second Ginger Grant""  Maryann hits her head and passes out.  When she comes to she thinks that she is Ginger.

""It's a Bird, It's a Plane!""  A jetpack washes ashore the island but Gilligan ends up wasting most of the fuel.

""Bang Bang Bang""  A crate containing moldable plastic washes ashore that the castways use to make various objects not knowing that the material becomes explosive when it hardens.

The other great thing about the show was the guest stars: Rickles, Silvers, John McGiver, Strother Martin, Rory Calhoun, Sterling Holloway...it all added to make this show a classic.",1121212800,8,2040,4.7988505747126435
2279752,4,B0009E322K,"With the impending release of season 3, it only makes me wish there had been a season 4.  In truth, I rate season 3 as Gilligan's weakest, although there are a few real gems (The Producer, Pass the Vegetables, Court Martial, The Hunter). I've always rated season 2 as the strongest overall.  Still, it only makes you wonder how much wilder and 'way out' the show would've gotten if there had been a fourth season.  Unfortunately, the studio heads wanted to bring back 'Gunsmoke', and a thirty minute sitcom had to be sacrificed...Gilligan became that casualty.  Alas, we still have the 'Gilligan' TV-Movies, which I hope will get a re-release with a few extras.

Truly, one of the all-time 'guilty pleasures' TV has ever produced...thank you, Sherwood....",1119916800,10,755,4.913385826771654
2279753,5,B0009E322K,"""Gilligan's Island,"" while never a hit with the critics, is beloved today by millions of fans.

2279754,5,B0009E322K,"This is the one I've been waiting for.  Of course, I bought the first two, but this one has the ULTIMATE Gilligan's Island episode, my favorite, ""Pass the Vegetables Please"" (#71).  Two words:  wacky trombone.  Every time Gilligan displays superhuman strength, that infectious trombone music comes bouncing in, wackily.  This is the reason I NEED the incidental music from this show.  Well, that and the music whenever somebody (i.e. Gilligan) gets dizzy or sees double.",1119657600,11,470,5.2
2279755,5,B0009E322K,"Season 3 episode 72 - The Producer is my favorite Gilligan's Island episode.

(...)

72. The Producer
gs: Phil Silvers (Harold Hecuba)

Famous Hollywood director Herald Hecuba lands on the island during his world-wide talent search. The castaways put on a musical version of Hamlet in order to impress the director, with hopes that he will take them back to Hollywood when he leaves.

NOTE: The songs in the play are words written from music straight out of the classic opera Carmen. ""To Be or Not Be"" is sung to the words of ""Toreodor"". Who said there was no culture on Gilligan's Island?",1116979200,6,589,4.689320388349515
2279756,5,B0009E322K,"Well we knew it was coming, the third and last season of Gilligan's Island will be released in July. I, and many others will buy Season 3 on the day, or within the week of it's release. With great anticipation we will watch it, but we sadly know the show is no more after this.

Gilligan's Island is a show with it's own great history, but is unique in it's own way. Fans know that the critics and prodcuers hated this show. One reviewer from way back then even said something like ""It's hard to belive that this show is made by adults"". As usual with all forms of entertainment, critics just don't get it. Gilligan's Island was a fascinating, entertaining, and highly enjoyable show. What other show has never been off the air and has enjoyed sindication for over thirty years? I think it's sad that the cast has never seen a penny.

Who has ever channel surfed and come across Gilligan's Island? We all have, and most of us will put the remote down to enjoy it. Again, it's entertainment. We can escape our own world and enjoy a half hour in paradise. Sure we've all seen every episode a hundred times over, but who cares? We still watch it, and we'll watch it again and again and again.

Maybe the movies will be released on DVD, but if you're like me and Tina Louise is your favorite castmember, it just isn't the same.

So when we buy Season 3, remember you're not watching it alone, millions will be watching with you, we're family.",1115596800,12,1438,4.394736842105263
2279757,4,B0009E322K,"Season 3 contains ""Up At Bat"" with a great dream sequence with Gilligan as a Vampire. Also, ""All About Eva"" with Tina Louis in a dual role, ""Gilligan Vs. Gilligan"" with Bob Denver as the Gilligan double (a spy). ""The Producer"" with guest Phil Silvers and the great Hamlet musical play. One of my favorites ""A Second Ginger Grant"" where Mary Ann hits her head and thinks she's Ginger! This is a must and probably the best season.

2279821,5,B0009E322K,"WHAT A GREAT SHOW! This is one of those shows that I missed quite a few episodes of. In the 1960's when most people still had Black and White Television Sets, I certainly didn't see any of these episodes in Color. Of course every Gilligan's Island Fan know that this show has never been off the air. But even with that fact I only recall seeing one Episode from this Season: ""RING AROUND GILLIGAN"", which was years later. And it's needless to say that every single episode is hilarious. Among my favorites from this season is: ""PASS THE VEGETABLES, PLEASE"". While Gilligan and the Skipper are out fishing, they wind up reeling in a box containing Experimental Vegetable Seeds that gives anyone who eat the Vegetables grown from them, strange powers. It was funny when Mary Ann ate Carrots and could see a boat that no one else could see. Gilligan ate Spinach and wound up with Super Strength. And after Lovey ate Sugarbeets, she had an incredible amount of Energy.

The only thing I don't like is that the Discs, in this Season, are all stacked on one spindle. The way I handle this situation is, after I have watched each disc, I place it underneath the rest of the discs until the first disc is on top again. This also helps me to remember where I left off. This isn't the only Series that I've bought with all the discs stacked on one spindle. So far I haven't had any problems. But what a cheap way to go! Though the price I paid for this Season seems to have been worth it, this is the ""FIRST SEASON"" I've bought. When this series was first released it wasn't going for less than $35.00. At least from the local merchants. I bought this selection, along with some others, with the intent to save it for ""CHRISTMAS"". When I decided to buy more selections, I took this one out to watch and replaced this with ""THE DONNA REED SHOW"": SEASON FOUR. So now it will be ""THE DONNA REED SHOW"" on ""CHRISTMAS"" instead of ""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"". BESIDES, TWELVE OTHER SELECTIONS ARE ENOUGH. I sometimes list the Episodes and what my interpretions of them are about. However, on this SEASON, I decided not to. But if I get my hands on anymore ""CHRISTMAS CASH"", SEASONS ONE AND TWO WILL BE ADDED TO THE SELECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING UNDER MY TREE.

There was an intended Season Four, but ""CBS"" needed to find some room on the schedule for the show: ""GUNSMOKE"", which was the favorite show of ""BABE PALEY"", who was the WIFE OF THE NETWORK'S PRESIDENT, ""WILLIAM PALEY"". Well, it certainly wasn't/isn't my favorite show, western or otherwise. So ""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND"", like tons of other shows, went out of production and or off the air without closure. Of course years later the movie: ""RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S LAND"" finally got ""THE CASTAWAYS"" OFF THE ISLAND, ONLY TO SHIPWRECK THEM AGAIN, BACK ON THE SAME ISLAND, AT THE END OF THE MOVIE. Well, at least RESCUE PARTIES would have known where to look.",1473724800,,2888,4.551923076923077

What turned me off watching it this time was the that Gilligan had to be the one that always fouled up and the way the skipper would treat him at times. I felt that if I were Gilligan I would have found a place on the island where I could be alone. Of course the Gilligan in the show would probably not have survived very well alone.
I know this is pure fantasy but all the clothes the Howell's had was unbelievable and the money!!! But then I guess it wouldn't have been as funny if it had been more like a reality show.",1402358400,,663,4.03030303030303

It is simply too unrealistic to be taken seriously.  Why was a millionaire on the same cruise as a farmer girl?  Where did they get all the clothes? How are the Howells able to live in comparative luxury without doing any work?  How can the professor make every conceivable contraption, yet can't even fix the boat?  Why is it that sometimes the reasons they can't get off the island is that there is no transportation, but other times they simply need the right directions?

2280121,5,B0009E322K,"Fifty years after first hitting the airwaves and with only two of the original seven cast members (Tina Louise, who played Ginger, and Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann) still alive, Gilligan's Island is still going strong and still building its fan base.  I'd love to see any modern show, with all their violence, gore, and profanity, still so popular after fifty years.  Gilligan's Island has none of the second two, and what passes for violence on the show is a few gunshots that never hit anybody, a few explosions that never kill anything but fish and palm trees, and a handful of fights which never take place on screen.  And of course, the Skipper smacking Gilligan with his hat, which he does whenever Gilligan screws up, which is every time Gilligan does anything, naturally.  My favorite ""fight"" is in the episode ""The Little Dictator"" from season two when a Latin American dictator takes Gilligan prisoner.  As they march behind a large bush, the sounds of a scuffle can be heard, and a cloud of dust rises, followed by the dictator marching out with his hands held high, and right behind comes Gilligan, now brandishing the dictator's pistol!  Of course, this is Gilligan we're talking about, so when the pair passes behind the next bush, the scene repeats itself, only now when they emerge, they are back to their original positions.  This show proves what today's directors and producers seem to have forgotten:  A high body count and constant swearing and sex talk are not necessary to make a movie or television show popular.
  Gilligan's Island also serves as yet another reason for me to wonder just what it is the movie and television critics are smoking. They love to point out the idiocy of the show, it's heavy reliance on slapstick comedy, and the improbability of it all.  Guilty on all three counts.  After all, that's what makes it so hilarious.  Yes, it's highly unlikely that the Howells would have brought along a chest full of money and enough clothes for three years on a three hour tour, or that Ginger would have brought a range of glitzy dresses, or that the Professor would have thought to bring along books on every subject known to man, or that he could create Geiger counters, explosives, vaccines, battery chargers, etc. from nothing but coconuts and palm leaves, but couldn't figure out how to patch a hole in a boat.  It's equally improbable that a tiny uncharted island would play host to a constant stream of visitors who somehow never take the castaways off or remember where it is, or that after months and even years the castaways would still be discovering things on the island they had never seen before.  Having said that, is it any more fantastic than many popular movies and shows today?  A couple of ""good guys"" who are crack shots taking on dozens or even hundreds of ""bad guys"" who somehow are unable to hit the broad side of a barn from ten feet away?  Zombies?  Vampires?  Space aliens with the technology to travel across the galaxy and crush every military on Earth but are unable to defeat a tiny group of humans armed with comparatively primitive weapons?  Seriously???  And Gilligan's Island is unlikely?  At least the events of the show, however improbable they may be, are mostly within the realm of possibility.
  Yet once again, it's the very unlikely nature of Gilligan's Island that makes it so funny and appealing.  I could watch every episode a hundred times over and still never get tired of it, and that seems to be the general consensus from pretty much everyone I've ever discussed this show with.  If you're looking for a break from our insane modern world with it's focus on sex, violence, and profanity, plenty of good, clean fun, and hour after hour of laughter, you can't go wrong with this timeless classic.",1396396800,,3784,4.7301829268292686

There are obvious and 'on purpose' flaws in each episode so you understand that the cast is playing with the audience.

Amazon is the best place to find older, hard to find stuff! The only thing i didn't like was that season 3 was in 3 separate large boxes instead of a box set with thin cases, which takes up more room on your shelves.

Picture quality is very good, especially if you are playing on a PlayStation 3 or an up-converting DVD player. You notice details that you didn't notice while watching on broadcast TV. Lagoon scenes (the waterfall) reveal that a lot of work was put into building a lagoon on the back lot of a studio and close ups of the cast look richer than broadcast TV by far.

2280724,3,B0009E322K,"This is the final and third season of Gilligan's Island,from /66-/67. Gilligan's Island was never a shining or bright moment in the history of television by any stretch,but it has since taken on a life of its own and has lived a good re-activated life in syndication. It's appeal? It is simply plain and innocent fun. Creator Schwartz never set out to harm anyone nor to make a statement. It was just the funny antics of seven stranded individuals trying to cope and get along on a tiny island until rescue came.
The eps in this season are really not much different in tone and execution than the others except instead of keeping most eps pinned to island endeavours,this season finds more and more eps taking place in dream like states allowing the cast to stretch a bit more. There are also seemingly more visitors to the island this season than last,but none alas ever effect a rescue. There is one ep however called ""The Hunt"" in this season that has to be given the ""most bizarre"" award for any comedy show,let alone Gilligan. It starred TV and screen actor Rory Calhoun as a hunter who arrives on the island. He doesn't hunt wild game but human beings and Gilligan becomes his main target. If there is any humour in it it is of the very,very dark variety. It belonged more on a Sci-Fi show than on a lighthearted show such as this. Truly strange.
As with other seasons also Laurel and Hardy are certainly in the house as Bob Denver and Alan Hale Jr. do their best imitations of the legendary team. Hale especially successfully channels Oliver Hardy right down to the camera looks,the body language and finger movements. The professor is absolutely amazing with the inventions he comes up with this season(and they couldn't make it off the island?)and the rest of the cast are,well,themselves as usual.
This season looks the best of them all as they are quite clear and crisp and there is an opening intro by creator Schwartz and a featurette on the series. The set contains three dreaded two-sided DVDs. I know companies do this for strictly financial reasons,but they are the worst way to go as they are terribly prone to scratching. Also the last disc here has only one operating side to it which begs the question:Why was it not made a single disc?
Wherever your feelings may fall about this series place in television history good or bad,Warner Brothers has at least done the series proud and done a good job of transferring them to DVD.It took me a long time to get an entire set of the series(season by season)that wasn't plagued by scratches and scuff marks mind you,but it finally came together. I hope you have better luck than I did little buddy!",1289001600,5,2662,4.618143459915612

2280726,3,B0009E322K,"Gilligan's Island was so well written, or so poorly written, that it has withstood the test of time.  It has been about 45 years since its debut and the comedy is not dated.  The concept of this type of humor: THAT is dated.  Physical humor is barely evident outside of Desperate Housewives.  We don't have the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the 3 Stooges, Abbott and Costello.  Today we have PC humor, so measured and careful it could not possibly be funny.  In light of what passes for humor today, the simple writing of Gilligan is not bad.  THe lines for Mr. Howell were always the best; his snooty asides were very reminiscent of the snooty asides of Popeye(for those that paid attention), among others.

A goofy show, but endearing, like Lost in Space. We all know these plots were implausible and thinly portrayed, but we also remember every episode by heart now.  The show was fun and if you want to restore that sense of fun, you might want this collection.  The comedy of the days of old is still good...",1284681600,3,1017,4.538461538461538

2280748,5,B0009E322K,"Gilligan's Island's third and final season...that sounds really weird doesn't it. After only three seasons this legendary sitcom was cancelled for re-runs of Gunsmoke. But even though only three seasons were aired, in all there are ninety eight episodes we can watch again and again and they will never be forgotten. This show never had a high point or a low point, what am I saying! The whole series was a high point for the show, and the physical never got dull. Thirty episodes were aired for season three and there really is no ending, and to be honest, I'm glad there isn't. Do they get off the island? We'll never know unless that is, if you watch the full length movie ""Rescue from Gilligan's Island.""

Season three's box set is in just as high quality as the first two, nice photographs of the cast and helpful episode descriptions on the inside of the DVD case. I know you probably already know this by now, but unfortunately the discs are all double sided so there easily scratched. But that's really not too big a problem, and I still haven't had too many problems with these discs yet. Again like season two, there is an introduction by Sherwood Schwartz to get you ready for the third season and he also did a commentary for episode four ""The Producer."" I was excited about a documentary on disc three called ""Gilligan's Island; A Pop Culture Phenomenon"" but it was unfortunately a bit short but still an interesting bonus feature to say the least.

One of my favorite episodes is from season three, it's ""Pass the Vegetables, Please"" when they all eat experimental vegetable seeds and they develop strange powers. I must have watched this one ten times, I just love that episode. I was also excited that Sterling Holloway (the original voice of Winnie the Pooh) guest starred, he's is featured in episode twenty-eight which is called ""The Pigeon."" Down below I'll list season three's episode descriptions so you can remember your favorites.

The cast of Gilligan's Island will always be remembered portraying there unforgettable characters, and I'm glad that Bob Denver loved his character.

From Harold Hecuba to Lord Beasley, the Kupakai Headhunters to radioactive seeds, season three will have you laughing outloud and shaking your head at the brilliance of the writers and actors.

It appears as though the writers ran out of island related topics and had to resort to centering shows around strange and bizarre dreams. For example Gilligan dreams he is a vampire, a super spy, Mr. Hyde, an admiral, a cave dweller. Mrs. Howell dreams she is Cinderella. There are a few good episodes but there are too many goofy plots. The strangest show of all three seasons is the one where a professional hunter comes to the island and makes a deal with the castaways where by he promises to rescue them if Gilligan can avoid being shot and killed. This was a little disturbing and not all that funny. With that being said, Season 3 is still better than anything new you see on primetime TV today.",1172016000,9,854,4.4113924050632916

2280803,5,B0009E322K,"Sadly for Gilligan and the castaway's, the three hour tour has finally come to an end. The final season of ""Gilligan's Island"" contains the remaining 30 episodes of this classic television show in amazing color. Just like seasons one and two the video is outstanding. The colors are sharp and vibrant and the sound is clean and crisp and comes across nicely on my sound system. Once again all 30 episodes and bonus features are crammed onto 3 double sided discs but the quality is really consistent throughout the episodes. As for the bonus features, I didn't care for them. Sadly the loveable ""Gilligan"" played by Bob Denver passed away in September 2005 and he will be missed by fans of the show. However, thanks to these DVD season sets he will live on as the loveable goofball Gilligan forever. Why didn't the studio include any DVD interviews with Bob Denver or the remaining aging cast of this classic show? Any interview from Bob Denver about working with Alan Hale or the cast would have been nice bonus or a where are they now featurette would have been even better. I can't help but wonder if the cast knew the show was coming to an end, because the episodes got even better in the final season. The one major complaint I have is that the made for TV movies were not included as bonus discs or features for the season sets. The studio seemed reluctant throughout the DVD release to include bonus features of any kind. The season sets would truly be complete if all of the made for TV movies had been included. Overall ""Gilligan's Island"" was good clean light hearted fun and pure entertainment for the entire family.

It was supposed to carry on for a fourth season,but CBS decided at the last minute to give it the axe(the ratings were high when the series finale aired in spring 1967). But we do see the cast rescued in a subsequent TV movie that premiered,I think,in 1978(entitled RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND). Despite the three-season run,GI has been relentlessly syndicated since CBS last aired it. I dedicate this item to the memories of Bob Denver(Gilligan),Alan Hale(the Skipper),Jim Backus(Thurston Howell III)and Natalie Schaefer(Thruston's wife Lovey Howell).

2280818,5,B0009E322K,"As others have already noted in their reviews, Sherwood Schwartz's sitcom ""Gilligan's Island"" was prematurely canceled after the 1967 television season, in order for CBS to make room on their prime-time schedule for one last season of the hit Western series ""Gunsmoke."" It would be wrong to praise Gilligan's Island by bashing Gunsmoke, since the latter is also a classic (and unlike Gilligan's Island, a long-running) television series, but it is certainly an interesting ""what might have been."" By the third year of their adventures on an ""uncharted"" island, it was clear that, far from running out of ideas and rehashing the same stale material over and over again, the castaways actually seemed to just be hitting their stride insofar as off-the-wall, so-idiotic-it's-hilarious comedy went. Gilligan's Island could have probably gone on to last at least six or seven seasons overall, but the very brevity of the show, and the lasting impact of the fewer-than-100 episodes upon millions of viewers worldwide, have served to make it a cult phenomenom -- something akin to the short-lived 90s series (and Clair Daines' star vehicle) ""My So-Called Life"" -- only without the pretense to realism or unnecessary histrionics.

Gilligan's Island is a gloriously, unapologetically stupid show, and that's why it's so great, and in no season is its greatness more wonderfully showcased than in the final year of its prime time life. Of particular interest in the third season are the increased number of guest stars on the island, the increase in the number of dream sequences (the episode where the Professor dresses up like Sherlock Holmes and calls Maryanne -- dressed as an 1890s street-urchin flowergirl a-la Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady -- an ""ugly old lady"" is priceless), and the increased involvment of the whole cast in getting into zany situations. In the first season, each of the castaways played straight-man to Gilligan's wild eccentriciries, with the exception of Mr. Howell, who is for me the most amusing character in the show, but in the second and especially in the third all of the other characters get a chance to behave in a silly (and fun) manner.

Each season of this show had many unforgettable episodes, but the third year -- and especially the episode where the castaways produced their own version of Shakespeare's Hamlet -- goes over the top, and in a good way. Other reviewers have already gone over the episode plot synopses, so I won't get into that, but trust me -- if you love Gilligan's Island, the episodes you'll find in season three are probably among the biggest reasons why.",1148601600,15,2610,5.011520737327189

Bob Denver, who will forever be remembered as Maynard G. Krebs on Dobie Gillis and, of course, Gilligan on Gilligan's Island, passed away on September 2, 2005 in a North Carolina hospital where he had undergone quadruple bypass surgery.  He was 70 years old.

Rest in peace, Good Buddy.

I believe that efforts should be made for the release of Dobie Gillis on DVD.

Like, rest in peace, Maynard.",1125964800,10,438,4.7105263157894735
2280840,5,B0009E322K,"The Gilligan's Island series is a must-have for collectors of classic television shows. Although I could find nothing to indicate that they've been remastered, the quality is quite possibly too good. Small details that were invisible on the small screens of years past are quite evident with today's technology; especially the make-up. I'd never really noticed it before, but we're talking full-throttle ""drag queen"" make-up here. Nevertheless, it does not distract from the great writing (especially those lines spoken by the Howells), clean comedy, and pleasant experience of watching these episodes commercial-free.

2280841,5,B0009E322K,"As with most DVDs, I tend to tune into the extras first, so I was anxious to see the documentary from the Gilligan's Island 3rd season set entitled ""Gilligan's Island: A Pop Culture Phenomenon"".  The box set has it clearly listed as being on Disc 3 Side B.  Well I popped it in.....and waited....and waited.  Hey was there something wrong with my DVD player?  It's been almost 10 minutes and nothing's happening!  As it turns out, I discovered the documentary is on Disc 3 Side A and there is absolutely nothing on Side B.  Looks like Gilligan had a hand in designing the box art work.  As usual, he goofed!!",1122940800,10,608,4.472727272727273
2280842,4,B0009E322K,"My son and I have been waiting for this set all summer since it contains his favorite episode - the one about the radioactive vegetables.  When we picked it up the other day we were surprised at the video and audio quality of most of the episodes.  The picture was clear and colorful and it appears they really worked on the sound of most of the episodes - very clear and full.  My son made the comment that it seemed like music sounding so good didn't fit a show this old!

Why only four stars then?  First - not all of the episodes have had the sound / video work done.  Some still sound muffled, which is OK since that's how they sounded when I watched them years and years ago.  I just like consistency!

Secondly - As with the old Columbia House VHS set that I have, some of the episodes have the opening title song in the wrong place.  Beginning with the spy episode and all of the episodes that followed, the title song came AFTER the opening scene, not before as in all of the previous episodes.  Some of them have been re-mastered correctly, others have not.  A giveaway on some of them is the ""Gilligan's Island"" title card that pops up at the opening of the first scene.  These were meant to let the viewers know what show it was (as if we wouldn't know!), since the title song had been moved to after that scene.

All in all, a great set.  Would have liked to have had many extras, such as old commercials, etc., but I guess that's what TVParty.com is for!",1122854400,10,1468,4.252707581227437
2280843,4,B0009E322K,"We all know how much of a classic GI is and I am sure many of us have seen every classic episode countless times. However , these 3 DVDS could of been so much more satisfying with more bonus features and more cast and crew interviews. The 3rd DVD side ""B"" was left blank which is totally inexcusable. How difficult would it of been to get Dawn and Bob or Russell to do a voice over on their favorite episodes. Who knows maybe even Tina might of finally had something positive to say after 40 years...well maybe not lol. I would of loved to see a final tribute to each and every castaway but Warner Brothers came up very small in the special features department. It would of been truly great to see the surviving castaways plus Sherwood all together for one last final get together.",1122595200,8,781,4.3561643835616435
2280844,5,B0009E322K,"Unlike many other shows of the 60s, Gilligan's Island went out on a high note, leaving good memories of a show that didn't tail off in quality after a 3-year run. Surprising, considering that watching it, you realize how much of a one-joke slapstick it really was. Despite its observable limitations, it proved itself popular enough to warrant the show a significant spot in the pantheon of archetypal TV comedy and endless re-runs that never seem to get stale. Sherwood Schwartz (Funnyman who was the genius behind Hogan's Heroes) turns in a different comedy gem with Gilligan, showcasing how a simplistic premise can be stretched for 3 years and stay on top of the quality barrel. It's Saturday night circa early 60's and right after The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS comes `Gilligans Island'.

When it first aired about the only two well-known members of the cast to the vast majority of viewers were Bob Denver who had appeared as the beatnik Maynard G. Krebs on Dobie Gillis and the multi talented Jim Backus. Russell Johnson who played the Professor was one of those actors that would appear on various TV shows. Its run on prime time was three seasons but thanks to re-runs Gilligans Island has in fact never left the airwaves. The 98 episodes play over and over yet they still hold up well today and one can still find themselves laughing at various episodes even though they may have seen it dozens perhaps even hundreds of times. The highlight, is of course, Bob Denver's fantastic comedic timing, coupled with some of the most original writing of the era. And let's not forget that fantastic theme song that has stayed burned in the memory of many fan's brains. A truly classic show that deserves its title, and the DVD extras are very welcome for a show that's almost 40 years old. This is essential TV comedy classic.",1122336000,39,1827,4.7272727272727275

2280846,5,B0009E322K,"I am THRILLED to complete my ""Gilligan's Island"" DVD set with Season Three.  This set is my most anticipated one because of episode #4, ""The Producer,"" with Phil Silvers.  This is the episode where the castaways perform a musical version of ""Hamlet"" for Broadway Producer Harold Hecuba. When I was very young I loved to sing ""Neither A Borrower Nor A Lender Be, Do Not Forget, Stay Out Of Debt.""  Years later in my early twenties I saw my first opera, Bizet's ""Carmen."" I was stunned to hear the SAME music that the castaways used to perform on their tiki lite stage!  To be honest...I'd prefer to watch a Gilligan's Island episode over an opera any day (my apology to opera fans everywhere!)

Many of us have seen ALL of the Gilligan episodes, having watched for decadeds and taped on vhs.  Gilligan's Island is now getting its due respect as one of the greatest all time comedy shows. The writing is simply brilliant and the acting is superb. Denver and Hale will go down in history as one of the greatest comic duos.  There is a good reason that Gilligan is the most re-run show in history: it is simply that good and is very, very funny. I can't wait to finally get the 3rd season on DVD and complete our collection. My two boys love Gilligan and the show is a tradition in our household.",1122076800,6,699,4.369230769230769

Seven original castaways are stranded on an uncharted island. Approximately once an episode the encounter a guest that just happens to stumble on the island and adds to the mix.

The is lots of slapstick and off the mark jokes. They also have an endless changed of closes including furs for the tropical island.

Re-watching at first you may think did I really watch this stuff for years. But then you find yourself anticipating the next guest and thinking where did I see him/her/it before. I remember Prof. Roy Hinkley Jr, Russell Johnson (19242014) as Hank Chapman in Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957.)
