An adult can look at it without expecting too much, and if this is the state of mind, she/he can appreciate the poetical aspects of the plot and the wonderful landscapes, that I understand are in Puerto Rico.

A young boy, living among banana groves in what looks like paradise, does not want to accept his mother marrying a stern midlle age man because he still admires and loves a father he thinks has died. With his two very funny friends, a girl and a boy, he messes up the wedding in a breathtaking scene. Out of the blue an airplane falls with a misterious American pilot. The boy falls in love with the airplane and its aura of freedom and adventure, he helps the pilot get it back together again and learns many things in the mean time....

Garbriel Garcia Marquez lovers will find a little bit of magic in some characters such as a strage old hermit, and in a few surreal situations, which I believe add some zest and humor to the plot.

Children appreciate questioning reality and are stimulated by unexplainable situations.

Try the recipe the boy's mother proposes with bananas, shrimp and bacon!

Good movie for a Sunday afternoon with kids.",1152403200,,1281,4.528138528138528

8217707,2,6305999473,"The Flight is a charming little movie, mostly about a boy and how he reconciles himself to the way his life is vs how he had wished it would be.  Gabriel (Kristian De La Osa) is upset that his mother is about to marry a very stern man, Frank (Miguel Sadoval).  When Clay (Dean Cain) crash lands in the field near his home, Gabriel is enamored with the prospect of flying and with the plane that seems to understand Gabriel's problems.  Clay is young, handsome, and full of flying stories that fill Gabriel's head with new dreams of a dad who will be fun and loving.  But like all tall, dark and handsome strangers, Clay has baggage with him that cannot allow him to fill the role Gabriel wishes.  As this all works out, Gabriel comes to see the softer side of Frank and to understand himself better.  Although this is billed as a Dean Cain film, his role is secondary to the story of Gabriel.  It is a sweet coming of age film and Dean Cain does a credible job as the dashing young pilot, but the film doesn't really showcase his talents.  If you are a Dean Cain fan, I would recommend ""No Alibi"" over ""The Flight"".  If you are looking for a coming of age film, you will enjoy this one.",969926400,14,1186,4.258928571428571
