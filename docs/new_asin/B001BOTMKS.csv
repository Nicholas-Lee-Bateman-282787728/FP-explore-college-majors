3496657,4,B001BOTMKS,"There is new information in this 3 DVD series, presented by the ancestors of Crazy Horse.  It is well produced, appears well researched by the family, and informative.  It is the family's version of historic events, and if you are interested in getting a feel for all that occured during that time period, this is an important piece of information, differing some, but definitely adding to the knowledge base that is ""out there"".

I spent this summer touring Wyoming Territory forts and battlefields and museums, reading books, listening to stories from re-enactors, visiting the Crazy Horse Monument, and visiting the sight where Crazy Horse was killed.  This DVD series added greatly to that experience.  It also filled in some gaps, as it dove-tailed with historical events, and provided new information I had previously never been aware of.

The series explains in detail the geneology of the Crazy Horse family.  It also narrates many of the important fights or battles of that era from a different perspective than I (we) have previously been exposed.

Why only four stars?  It seemed a little expensive.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1222905600,12,1149,4.9375
8283981,5,B001BOTMKS,"Finally,(!!) after so many (!!) claims to the actual history of this man, the family has come forward with the truth and the facts that tell the heretofore , untold genuine story of this man, as told by actual family members. Untold numbers of books and articles, even movies, have fictionalized and distorted his life story, which is an incredible dishonor to this hero of the Lakota people. Thankfully, we can now read the untarnished truth of his life and history leaving any future writings of him by others subject to abiding to the actual facts as described here...Wopila Lo!!",1477008000,,582,4.83
8283982,5,B001BOTMKS,Great historical lesson and a solid look at Crazy Horse's family tree. Great for future generations of his family and a great legacy to pass on.,1464134400,,144,4.576923076923077
8283983,5,B001BOTMKS,Enjoyed this DVD so much we bought the other three in the series.,1444003200,,65,4.076923076923077
8283984,5,B001BOTMKS,"This first of three videos in the series is very interesting and includes some spectacular scenery and some fairly common photos of Native Americans that appear in many other publications, because Crazy Horse did not allow anyone to make a photograph of him.  I purchased the set of three videos but I haven't watched the other two yet.  The set is an oral history of the life of Crazy Horse from members of his family.  From what I have learned and read about Crazy Horse, this set of videos seems to add some plausible information about his life, much of which is not well-documented.  While the set claims to be ""authorized"" it should be made clear that the video is authorized only to the extent that the information presented by his descendants is clearly remembered and is otherwise accurate.  In defense of the videos, I learned of the set while reading a well-written book about the life of Red Cloud (The Heart of Everything That Is by Bob Drury and Tom Clavin) and purchased the videos based on their reference.  If you are interested in Native American history, I recommend purchasing the set.",1439078400,,1104,4.694300518134715
8283985,5,B001BOTMKS,"There are, in all, four films in this series on the Crazy Horse Family.  Created by William Matson as a result of a death bed request by his father, also himself a writer and film maker, they are at the moment obscure and not as well known as they should be.  These films should be in the collection of or available for purchase at the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian; in schools and educational institutions all over the country, not just those dedicated to the study of Native history.  Let's just start there, then on to the world.
The essence of these films is the bedrock spirituality that has existed in an unbroken chain within this family (and many others) since time began, as manifested within those who bore this honor name, Tashunka Wit'ko.  ""Roland with an Eagle Bone Whistle"", he's been called; ""the Sioux Christ"" or the ""Indian King Arthur"" - understandable comparisons from the viewpoint of the white world, but there is much more to it than that.  Spirit brought these films about, and for a reason.
As these films reveal, he not only lived, he lives now.  And will live again.",1438905600,,1104,4.635897435897436
8283986,5,B001BOTMKS,Real good stuff.  Read a lot of books.  This has info I've never heard.,1428105600,,71,4.0
8283987,5,B001BOTMKS,So glad to see Native Americans speaking out these days and telling the true history. This was not about the death of Crazy Horse as much as it is about his life from the Indian perspective.,1427241600,,190,4.305555555555555
