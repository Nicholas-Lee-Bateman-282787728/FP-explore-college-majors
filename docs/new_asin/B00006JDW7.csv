8739034,4,B00006JDW7,"Hip-hop 4 Life is a movie that many people can relate to. Even though the movie is based in the Hip-hop realm, it is mainly a story about choices. The main character Devon is forced to choose between music and his friends, girlfriend, and school.
The movie also tries to show the amount of practice and dedication it takes to make it in the music business and that here is a lot more to it then just talent. It also introduces new things in the underground battle scene such as the prop test and tag team battles, two things you have to witness.
Overall this is a good movie for teens and adults to watch, there are a few intimate love scenes, but nothing too graphic. I'd recommend this move to anybody who wants to watch a good story. Don't let the Hip-hop in the name fool you. Everyone can enjoy this film even if you don't listen to Hip-hop music.",1088380800,,852,4.298136645962733

For anyone trying to get down in the hip hop game, this is a MUST SEE.  The MC battles and the ""prop test"" are the fire!  I can't wait to see what this new director has in store for his next film.",1035676800,,310,3.7384615384615385
