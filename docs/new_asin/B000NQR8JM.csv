2777594,5,B000NQR8JM,A GREAT SHOW. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. BUY THIS ONE WITHOUT HESITATION. WELL WORTH THE MONEY & TIME.,1223683200,,95,5.0
2777595,4,B000NQR8JM,"This is a fun item that needs a low-brow sense of humor to appreciate. I enjoyed it quite a bit but I did think the profanity often didn't serve any purpose.

The style of entertainment you get from this is comparable to ""Wild Arms"" or ""Those who hunt elves"". Though neither of those are as lewd as this is.

Some dialog is so painfully funny (at least from a guys perspective) that I actually had a tear in my eye from laughter.

There is a scene very early in the anime where the anti-hero of the show meets another mercenary who is generously endowed with a triple X sized bra cup. He speaks to her, and in about ten seconds he manages to make a statement that both greets her, and at the same time uses every possible slang synonym for ""large breasts"" in the entire english lexicon. It was quite funny.

This anime doesn't take it self too seriously. Which is good because it makes the humor believable.
A statement ""remember this from episode one"" is actually said by one of the characters. That the characters are aware they are in an animated series, states definitively that this shouldn't be taken too seriously.

Also the large bouncy breast thing is over done but it doesn't seem to get tired the way it did in ""Mizuki Chronicles"" (Which I thought was total crap for many reasons but two come to mind that relate to this anime. Not only did the ""Mizuki Chronicles"" take itself WAY too seriously, almost every single female in the entire show had triple D sized overly bouncy mammaries).

Thankfully ""Desert Punk"" only has one set of ridiculously sized breasts to work with and it is enough to be fun yet not insulting to ones intelligence.

Is it a work of art? Well... you'll have to judge... I would argue no... worth a laugh? Yes.

This really isn't appropriate for kids in my mind. I'll let my son watch it when he turns sixteen.

It is good for a laugh and the box set quality is comparable to ""Trinity Blood"", ""Basilisk"", or ""Avenger"". The collectors tin is nice too.

Over all it was good, and I liked it, but like ""Trinity Blood"" it is a bit pricey for what you get.",1204416000,24,2085,4.40625
2777596,5,B000NQR8JM,"I thought it was very entertaining, if you take it for what it is and don't pick it apart the story is brilliant. The setting kind of reminds me of Trigun even some of the combat in the sense that there are a lot of good gun fights. Also there's some adult humor in it but it's on an almost childish level. Funny none the less though.",1194912000,10,334,4.0
2777597,4,B000NQR8JM,I have seen alot of anime and this one I have to say ranks in the top ten of the comedy section.  If you like sexual inuendos and good old dirty humor then this is one for you.,1193529600,15,176,3.6315789473684212
2777608,5,B000NQR8JM,"I've only watched a few episodes so far, but am loving the dirty humor!  It's not in a South Park, over the top style, but more in a sarcastic and witty way.

There are some great lines in this series, it is almost better watching the English dub first, that way you can get the humor a little easier than reading the subtitles and processing the jokes.  I did like the letter to the enemy gang leader: ""PS: your mother's a whore.""  He also says about 10 euphemisms for breasts in about 45 seconds in once scene.

The main reason I am pre-posting this review before finishing the series is to note that this is the same as the new re-release, only in the collectible metal tin.  Currently this is cheaper than the new version.  I bought mine used like new for $12 with Prime shipping.  Better than the $30 re-release.

But whether you buy this set or the Viridian collection, it's a zany, wild anime series with a lot of dirty jokes.  Not quite as over the top in the 'poke fun at other anime series' as School Rumble 2 or Excel Saga; but it does poke a lot of fun at action films and action anime.  Great series for those with anime watching experience and an open mind and a good sense of humor.",1345852800,,1197,4.252212389380531
2777609,5,B000NQR8JM,"This has to be one of the funniest animes I have EVER watched and I've watched plenty. It has it's ""dark"" humor so if you're not into that, then don't get it, if you are or don't mind then by all means get it! This anime will make you piss your pants, truly a fantastic anime, you won't be disappointed.",1338076800,,303,4.066666666666666
2777610,5,B000NQR8JM,"This series is totally underrated and has got to be the funniest I have seen, the plot is interesting and the characters even more so, the ending is awesome and definitely true to sunabozu's nature. This series is a rare gem and should not be overlooked.

The thing I look for most when buying an anime series is if it has any re-watch value and this set has it in spades. I cannot recommend this series enough, if you could get it for under $35 it is a must buy 9/10",1314662400,,467,4.131868131868132
2777611,5,B000NQR8JM,"Rating:
R(This is not for children, not only is it inappropriate but a lot of the jokes you kind of have to be older to understand)
-Sexual themes
-language
-Violence
(There are some other things that give this R rating justice but you can find that on your own, it's really in opinion by the viewer)

Alright here's the breakdown of this anime:

-Great dub

-Amazing plot, but sometimes can drag on for a little bit but makes up with a great ending

-Funny as hell, almost every episode brings me to tears in laughter

Alright on the negative side for viewers that want to be cautious about before buying this:

A big thing about this anime is that you really have to appreciate being a guy. Not only does it have many sexual themes it almost brings in nudity but just leaves us with cleavage and very revealing clothes. Another thing you should know, Desert punk is a horny bastard, excuse the language but that's the clearest way to describe him. (Don't get me wrong, this is a great anime it just has many moments that you really shouldn't watch with your wife or girlfriend, most of all your children, it's rather awkward)
Other then the main character being a douche and kind of an idiot at points you really can't go wrong with this anime.

Over all this anime will make you roll on the floor with laughter, acquire many colorful words into your vocabulary and just have fun.

Sincerely,
Robert Riegel",1296518400,,1408,4.515748031496063
2777612,5,B000NQR8JM,This series is really an amusement park ride from the first to last episode. It really has a charm all of its own. Usually I shy away from goofy comedy type animes but this one does a lot of things well. It actually makes you laugh. I wish there was a second season I can't get enough of Junko's succulent rack of... lamb... ah yes... she's a good cook. She's a very good cook.,1294185600,,377,4.108108108108108
2777613,5,B000NQR8JM,This is about a young man who wanted to become famous only a few things are on his mind making a name for himself getting rich women and paying off his debts he go through the seert finding guns and such he can sale doing jobs to pay back his debt he finds a kid who he mentors he gets in trouble because he a womenizer and always thinking about women the ending was good its kinda action gun shooter type story he finds himself in alot of trouble yet gets out its fun to watch worth having,1286064000,2,490,4.010204081632653
2777614,5,B000NQR8JM,"I just LOVED this DVd collection set. I can not tell you guys how funny the Desert punk anime program is.. The humour is really hilarious and the jokes are out there- it has a little crashness but it is not lewd- funny yeah--- and the stories are good and usually contained within each episode- which i like. If you like the City hunter anime - then you would like this- becuase both heroes are searching for ""a good time"" if you get me- and both seem doomed as they fight bad guys and just TRy to get a little loving on the side-- haha- Watch it- i loved it",1279238400,3,558,4.081818181818182
2777615,5,B000NQR8JM,"Hilarious anime, and for the first time that I've seen, the liberal English dubbing is actually better than the more exact translation.",1272240000,3,135,5.181818181818182
2777616,4,B000NQR8JM,"To be frank, the main character is a cynical, manipulative, depraved, black-hearted pervert.  His only positive features are his tenacity and dedication to work. Besides that he is a pretty wicked person.  Desert Punk is simply a raunchy misadventure in the desert. Nothing more and nothing less.  Its pretty offensive, but quality wise it could have been much worse.  Know what your getting into before buying this series.",1271376000,,423,5.176470588235294
2777617,5,B000NQR8JM,"I had never heard of Desert Punk before seeing it here and reading the reviews. I don't regret this purchase at all. Its kind of childish , but definitely not for kids. The humor catches you off guard and sometimes I'm like ""Did they really say that"". So if you want a 6 disc set thats not too much more than a new release movie , then buy this set. You get several hours of viewing , a collectors tin and cool art. A win in my book.",1269907200,4,433,3.9318181818181817
2777628,4,B000NQR8JM,"I watched this back a few years ago and loved it, put it on my wish list, and got it in the tin for xmas, downside is no disc one. Other then that great quality show, I just can't really re watch it with the first episodes MIA. Other then what I am hoping is a rare problem I highly recomend this tin box set.",1261699200,,309,3.769230769230769
2777629,4,B000NQR8JM,"Bought this as a gift for somebody who likes obscure anime.  From my brief exposure to it, I would say it is very entertaining, combines some good sci-fi overtones, but is not an anime classic.",1258070400,,193,4.514285714285714
2777630,5,B000NQR8JM,"when I was recommended this series from a friend. I dodnt know what to exspect. but I must say it was highly enjoyable. the characters were well written, the action scenes kicked ass, and it had one of the most interesting plot twists out there. If ya like post apocolyptic series like Trigun, this is your bag.",1253836800,3,311,4.473684210526316
2777631,5,B000NQR8JM,"I can't remember the last time I've laughed at an anime so much. FUNimation did a fantastic job dubbing this in English with a very mature, crud, and witty dialog. From the cover I thought it was going to be a drama, and I'm happy it wasn't. Too many anime's are heavy and dark, and don't get me wrong I love those, but this was like a breath of fresh air. I'd recommend it to anyone, not just anime fans. This may now be my favorite anime.
*The dialog is similar in crudeness to Shin-chan so if that offended you (grow some balls), you'll probably want to avoid this, as well.*",1250467200,,578,4.216216216216216

2777633,4,B000NQR8JM,"Desert Park is NOT for children, or for anyone that's not into some very crude humor.  With that said, you'll probably laugh when the first episode is over and wonder what'll come next.  While devoid of a real plot except the last 5 episodes, this anime is pretty good.  It has fanservice thanks to the busty Junko and Desert Punk spends his time trying to woo her....and failing miserably (perhaps they get together by the end of the series?).  This anime is the funniest anime I ever watched, but its crude humor....don't watch if you're easily offended by the humor.
  Desert Punk is known as the ""demon of the desert"" and is a very skilled bounty hunter and merc that goes around doing jobs while trying to survive the savage heat of the desert.  This is set thousands of years in the future after something wiped out the last civilization.  The people of the desert call our time the ""dark ages"".  A highly enjoyable anime if you're looking for something a bit different.",1233273600,3,976,4.595375722543353
2777634,5,B000NQR8JM,"Okay... so recently I bought this product, and it's a GREAT series, I'll give it that, it's got comedy, fanservice, action, everything really.

But inside my box when I opened it up, I noticed I have disc 1, 4, 3, 4, 5, and 6... no disc 2, but two disc 4s, and unfortunately there's no real way to like... correct this so I'll prolly just have to buy a seperate disc 2 and swap it out for the extra disc 4(and hopefully the individual dvds are the same as the ones that come in the box set), unfortunately the individual discs no matter where I've gone cost more than I paid for the boxset itself. And it was factory sealed, so it's not like someone swapped it, it is just an anomally that occured and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else?",1231977600,,752,4.222222222222222
2777635,5,B000NQR8JM,"O.K. First you need to be mature and have a good sense of humor to watch this anime. Second, it helps if you're a guy. Third, girls will probably begin to like it if they watch it long enough, I say, starting around episode four.
K. So your main character is a mercenary who gets his job done by any means necessary, and you should see some those by any means necessary if you think you can handle it. His later to be apprentice is a little girl who wants to be tough just like him, but in her own way. She gets treated like dirt at first, but it pays off in the end. Desert Punk loves hooters, especially big ones like the milk jugs he's rival, love interest, friend, and bully Juno has. This is another girl in the series that might attract girls to watch this anime because she's already at a state Punk's apprentice wants to be. Just about all characters in this anime are rivals to each other and can only be forced to work with each other. They don't really care if the other one dies. I mean, they'll write ""Go to Hell"" on their tombstones even though the day before they were helping each other out in a mission. But that's because their world is a desert land where water is so scarce people go months without taking a bath. The main story slowly unfolds with passing episode which almost gave me a hard time to really get into it, because I couldn't guess what the big problem was in the first few episodes. It was hard to point out the main boss or threat in this anime. In fact, I'm still kind of confused. I guess this first box set was just to introduce the characters and the situation at hand. I was left wanting more, much more. Just like other great anime have done to me, also. Such as FLCL, Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, Samurai Champloo, and Trigun. So check this anime out and have a blast.",1231372800,3,1818,4.257225433526012
2777636,5,B000NQR8JM,"This is the craziest series I've seen in a while.  It is for Mature audiences, but they mix things together to give you something funny to laugh at.  How about a tough enemy and the Desert Punk fighting each other and then they end up throwing rocks and shooting rubber bands at one another.  It sounds stupid but if you saw this fight, you'd die laughing at how funny it was.",1231200000,,376,4.267605633802817
2777637,5,B000NQR8JM,"This is a great anime if you like boobs and crude humor which I do. It really is more something a guy might like, but I really usually relate to my guy friends humor more than my girl friends. It has a lot of jiggling boobs, an anti-hero main character, and some really amazing ideas of how to get out of tight spot. If you looking for semi-light hearted entertainment this is great! I say semi-light hearted only because they are living in a merciless desert and survival is everyone's main priority.",1225411200,,501,4.456521739130435

8180710,5,B000NQR8JM,"the following review is about the packaging of the desert punk tin set, not the anime itself.

to start the review, the tin that holds the DVDs is vary sturdy and has wonderful art on it featuring the main characters. when you open the tin, you'll see a fold out case (that's covered in cool artwork) that has the DVDs, opening the fold out case revealing 4 sections. the first section holds the art booklet, the art booklet has the box art of all 12 Japanese desert punk DVDs plus a few extra pieces of art, sections 2-4 hold the DVDs (2 per section)

overall this is a really good set any anime collector would love to have in their  collection  but it's kinda rare nowadays so if you see one for a good price, snatch it up!!!!

if you want to know if the anime itself is any good, just read the other reviews, most people have the same opinion i do!

This is a Action/Comedy/sci-fi/post apocalyptic anime with the focus being a lot on the Adult humor, fan service, and crazy attitude of the ""Desert Punk"".

The story...Well is small and almost nonexistence.

The Entertainment was more then made up for with the Comedy.

The first half of the series is full of fun comedy and adventures of ""Desert Punk"" The second half takes a slightly darker and less humorous approach (You can tell with different opening and ending music.)

Over all there is a a lot of adult humor, some action/violence, some fan service, and some blood I took a chance with this anime and was not disappointed.

So I do recommend this for the adult anime lover.",1363305600,,942,4.610778443113772

It's got pretty good fight scenes but it's not all about fighting it's about the hilarious journey of a teenage assassin with a thing for Tig ole Bitties.
