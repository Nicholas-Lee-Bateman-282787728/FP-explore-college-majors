2893691,4,B000T2OWWG,"As with the first GBD DVD, there are some true gems on this volume. Others....not so much. It seems that this one is getting better, maybe if they do a volume 3 they will have hit it on the mark.

I will list which performances, in my opinion, best capture the spirit of Gothic Bellydance:

Laura Rose - her music choice (Wumpscut's My Dear Ghoul), whiteface, costuming, are all very goth. Her combination of jerky, swooning, and controlled movements is very well done and fits the music. And check out her sideways belly rolls. Wow.
Blanca - I didn't like her in the first GBD, but in this one she dances to Corvus Corax's Filii Neidhardi, and I thought she captured the spirit very well.
Shakra - My favorite! They do two numbers in a row. The first is to Maduro's Discordia, and it is deliciously creepy. Watch it and see. The second is Wumpscut's March of the Dead, where they stomp around in platform boots. I love it when the dancers dance TO THE MUSIC, not just in time with it!
Tempest - I had the chance to meet Tempest a few weeks ago and she is a wonderful person, genuinely nice. She dances to Jill Tracy's You Leave Me Cold and Collide's Wings of Steel. I'm not sure about the plastic extensions in Wings of Steel but I always love her fluid and dynamic dancing.
Ariellah - She has amazing isolation, and knows how to use her music. I preferred her dance to Die Form's The Hidden Cage to the other one (it just clicked better to me).
Mavi - I prefer the Isis wing dance to Corvus Corax's Mille Anni Passi Sunt, very dramatic. The sword dance wasn't a good fit with the music and dancing style.
Sashi - Her style of dancing is not my favorite but she is very good at her style, small, precise and controlled. Her music and costuming choices fit very well within the goth genre.
Jeniviva - Her first piece is more of a music video (but it's Clan of Xymox so I'm OK with that!) but her second piece is a Karslimar, and she is very playful and flirty, and knows how to dance to a 9/8.

These are the performers I think were way off the mark. Not that they are(or their dancing is) bad, but these performances would fit better with the Evening of Experimental Middle Eastern Dance than with Gothic Bellydance:
Bellyessence and Sarah Skinner
Ayshe and Adrienne
Elsa Leandros
Sherene-Vismaya
Isis
Maiiah
Neon

All in all, I enjoy watching this DVD. There are only a few tracks I skip.",1193097600,16,2390,4.388261851015802
2893692,1,B000T2OWWG,"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD and am now regretting it. Wearing black doesn't make a 'gothic' belly dancer. There are some good performances on the disk but they're few and far between. I ended up skipping through all of the interpretive dances, isis wings and standard cabaret routines trying to find something remotely 'gothic' or even something unique. Of the 23 performances, only 4 I would watch a second time.",1192752000,9,434,4.878378378378378
2893693,5,B000T2OWWG,"The variety of dance styles presented in this DVD, and the sheer length of it (105 minutes) give you your money's worth in entertainment, though if you are looking for an ""only bellydance"" presentation, you may be disappointed, as some of these numbers are dramatic and interpretive, and owe more to Isadora Duncan and Theda Bara in their heritage than traditional middle eastern bellydancing. There are also different levels of skill in the performances, but even the lesser ones are enjoyable, and watching the DVD with an artist's eye, I find something visually interesting in all of them. What makes this a 5 star DVD is not only having this pastiche of marvelous dance and musical styles, but also the 11 superb numbers by 8 performers that are standouts, as well as several more that would be in the 4 star category.

The standouts are:
1: Neon is a shimmering knockout in her 2 numbers (tracks 12 and 17), with stunning costumes, her long blonde hair, and the precision of her movements. Track 11 has her dancing with a lit candelabra on her head, with such amazing ease.
2: Anything danced by Arielah is captivating. Here in tracks 10 and 22, she delights us with the musicality of her undulating movements, and her totally unique style.
3: Tempest is a favorite of mine. There is a sensuality and beauty in her arms that is exquisite, and I never tire of watching her. She does 2 numbers, tracks 13 and 23.
4: Blanca does a stellar dance in track 4 (she is also in track 6, but this is a number that has little dancing).
5: Sera and Solstice (Laura Parker and Melissa Randazzo) are sensational in a synchronous piece.
6: Maiiah is riveting in her cape and snake dance! (track 14)
7: Jeniviva's second piece (track 16) is excellent (her first, the opening number, is dramatic sequence at a masked ball, and is mostly atmospheric with little dancing)
8: I thoroughly enjoy the elegance of Isis in the final number (track 24)

Among others that are good are Sa' Elayssa (track 7), and Mavi's dance in which she deftly twirls and balances a huge sword (track 18). Most of the dances are presented on a bare stage, and are well lit. For a look at the many facets of contemporary bellydancing, this is a great DVD to watch. With so many different styles, you may not appreciate all of it, but some if not most of it will delight anyone interested in diverse forms of dance, and the music that accompanies it.",1191974400,20,2411,4.578703703703703
2893694,5,B000T2OWWG,"Wow and I do mean WOW. I enjoyed this Gothic Bellydance Revelation DVD better than the first one with dancers like Jenviva, Sashi and Isis what's not to like. Jeniviva told a story with her dance and it was beautiful. This dvd shows that bellydancing can be different. You can make it what you want. there are no hard and fast set rules. These performers have made their styles their own while still exploring their love of the dance. The costumes and use of props were sensational. Bravo.

2893695,3,B000T2OWWG,"i am a gothic belly dancer so i'm always looking for new videos to watch and study. while several of the dances in this video are really awesome to watch, probably 2/3 of it i didn't finish watching because it was so boring. they think that by wearing gothic clothes or just ""black"" they can say they're gothic belly dancers but a few of these women are super boring, have no spirit and just look like regular cabaret belly dancers wearing red. for the ones that are good though they're worth watching. i'd try to youtube the dancers first because i'm not sure it's worth the $ to buy.",1264291200,,585,4.376146788990826
2893696,3,B000T2OWWG,"This DVD is worth buying if you can get it cheap/used.  I wouldn't pay full price.  I treasure it for the Shakra performance and one other exceptional dancer (Blanca?).  If you like Shakra as much as I do ... their piece makes the DVD worth owning.

After those 2 pieces, I found the other material a bit pretentious or boring.  Your mileage may vary - especially if you are more into goth culture than I am.  I judge only the Dance and Choreography.",1262131200,,450,4.36144578313253
2893697,1,B000T2OWWG,"Horrible horrible horrible. let me first start off by saying that i am a dancer and also into the goth scene. I purchased this thinking oh wow gothic bellydance?? so i watched it and it was such a disgrace. the dancers lack skill, they look like theyve never danced ever in their lives, and don't know how to use the props. whats so cool about laying next to an ankh and shaking like your possessed to a terrible wumpscut song? where is the dance in that? One girl has really cheap wings and just spins in a circle for like ten minutes. One acts like shes having an orgasm then a DETECTIVE comes out of nowhere and she ""smokes""? are you kidding me!!!?!?! we need to be cautious when we label something bellydance and IT IS NOT. this is simply gothic dances, ritual dance, and no not the ancient goddess type. These dancers look like they're only doing it to look cool or something, ruining the dance just to inflame their own ego. It's sad that with their ads in gothic beauty magazine people who never even knew what bellydance is truely all about, are going to buy this dvd get into bellydance and think that a lame-o is their inspiration like tempest. Ugh i need to stop before i make myself sick. hope this review helped.",1253577600,12,1225,4.400881057268722
2893698,5,B000T2OWWG,"If you're looking for a traditional bellydance performance video or have strong opinions about what is and isn't ""gothic"" or ""bellydance"", this video is probably not for you. If you respect creativity and are open to different styles and interpretations of dance no matter what its label, you'll love it. It's a treat for me since although I've heard of most of the dancers, I hadn't seen the majority of them perform. Categories, styles and labels aside, this DVD contains some amazing performances.

Two of the performance pieces are mainly theatrical and contain little bellydance. Jeniviva's first piece is more like an introduction to the DVD that includes many, if not all, of the other dancers. Everyone's got masks on so it's hard to tell. You can spot Neon by that blond hair and bangs and there's a clear shot of Blanca. A tattooed arm might be Tempest or Ariellah or a number of others. Jeniviva does all of thirty seconds of actual dancing and we're cheated out of getting a better look at her fabulous costume, but the piece is dark, sexy and very well done. Her second piece is an amazing solo with pure, joyous energy that highlights all of her skills and more than makes up for the first one - if you didn't have your heart set on it being ""Gothic."" Blanca's (the main reason I bought the DVD - she's one of my favorites) two performances also show both facets and both are mesmerizing in their own ways although they are completely opposite. The more I look at her slow, theatrical piece the more I love it.

If I was going to get all nit-picky and choose which piece was true to the DVD title, I'd have to say that it's Laura Rose's. The music and costuming are perfect and she is an amazing bellydancer that I want to see more of. She does an amazing horizontal belly roll that absolutely must be seen and all of her moves are pure belydance incorporating several different styles. She's really gotten creative with Khaleeji movements.

Shakra performs a very dark piece that leans more toward the theatrical with some more great bellydance moves than I initially thought. After viewing the trailer for their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakra-s-Industrial-Strength-Dance-Workout-Tribal-Bellydance-World-Fusion/dp/B0016C7E0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakra's Industrial Strength Dance Workout - Tribal Bellydance, World Fusion</a>&nbsp;I was embarassed that I hadn't realized that some of the movements are based on African and other cultural dances. I am fascinated with their style and want to see more of them. Part of the second half of the performance reminded me of an aerobics class for zombies with its big, energetic and robotic movements and the six inch KISS-style platform boots that make the dancers appear larger than life. They look like they had a lot of fun with this creatively choreographed and perfectly performed piece. As a trio, their moves are perfectly in synch and if there are any mistakes, they're not obvious. I definitely want to see more of them as well - a performance DVD would be nice.

I was also very impressed that this DVD includes a performance by a ""mature"" dancer, Elsa Leandros, but disappointed in that this is the only performance that I'm disappointed with. Elsa does a medieval style routine to Jehan's Metal Mix music in a costume that simulates chain maille. I get the intent and the energy, but her dancing looks somewhat awkward and as if not a lot of thought went into the choreography. The props are a bit too large and the routine would have been a great one for sword instead. The length of the skirt in the costume is also at fault. The knee-high gladiator sandals under a mid-calf-length skirt detract seem to draw the eye downward and away from the hip and belly movement. The skirt is an odd length and snug fit and not at all flattering to the dancer. In fact, I don't think that it would look good on anybody. A longer, fuller skirt or even Melodia pants under the skirt would have made a significant difference - or maybe even just getting rid of the sandals.

Neon's first track left me wondering, ""What the hell was that?"" but as always, her unique style and energy prevail. Instead of music, Neon is dancing to a poetic spoken piece with music in the background. She calls this a photo-novel, I believe. There is a part with some fast moving still photos with balloon quotes. You have to pause and move through these slowly to read them, which you should to make the rest of it make a bit more sense. I don't think I've ever seen this done before and had to watch it a second time to appreciate it. Her second piece is that typical snakelike snappy Neon energy and of course, another one of her unique costumes.

The majority of the remaining performances are closer to traditional and tribal bellydance and I can't find fault with any of them. I'm blown away by Ariellah, so much so that I plan to buy her instructional DVD as soon as I can. Sarah Skinner and Bellyessence's piece didn't seem to ""fit"" at first but the more I watch it, the more I understand and appreciate it. I'm impressed that this DVD attempted to include a mix of ages and body types of dancers. The beautiful Isis is amazing, and I love Tempest because she has my body type. We're pretty straight up and down - no amound of weight gain gives us hips and no amount of weight loss will shrink our waists.  The costume in her first performance is gorgeous and the skirt has the necessary layers and draping around the hips to help us cheat a bit.

I enjoyed all of the performances and the DVD makes me want to see more of these dancers. Most of them are new to me. Unlike others I've purchased, this one lacks dancer bios - although it does list their websites - and I would have appreciated them. The DVD includes more than twenty performances, so even if a few aren't quite your pair of zills there's still plenty to enjoy. If I like it this much after the first few viewings, I'm sure that I will enjoy it even more as time goes on.

The performances include almost all of the props as well - candles, wings, sword and even a snake! There's lots of creative use of fabric, including a hooded cape, and the music, including a few selections by Jehan, is incredible. I'm a strong advocate for artistic creativity and artists who are not afraid to step outside of the box, and I'm giving it five stars.",1234915200,2,6405,4.6912811387900355
2893699,3,B000T2OWWG,"This DVD is more of a show to appreciate every aspect, including music, costuming and scenery with belly dance than to really focus on the dancing.

Most of the DVD is quite good and you can really appreciate every movement and the dancers really get you into the goth vibe, but is also a piece that is not even closely related to dance, they are just standing still looking from one direction to another for the whole piece.",1234137600,,425,4.448717948717949
2893700,4,B000T2OWWG,"Although some of the dance on this disc is more interpretive dance than belly dance, I would purchase this disc again just to watch Sashi. There is definitely a variety of skill levels represented on the disc, as well as a variety of musical styles represented.  Each dance is a drama in itself.  All the dancers have their own unique style and their performances are creative and inspiring.  Don't even get me started on the clothes -- to die for!  The disc wasn't quite what I expected, yet I am completely satisfied and will watch it repeatedly.",1233705600,,548,4.618556701030927
2893701,5,B000T2OWWG,"Though I'd agree there were some dances I did not like, I feel that more of the dances made me want to get up and dance than not. This is the first belly dancing I've every watched, so I obviously don't know much about it, but as an ""outsider"" it's very entertaining, beautiful, and fun!",1231977600,,287,4.236363636363636
2893702,5,B000T2OWWG,"This is so good I'm obsessing about it.  In fact, Ayshe's first piece is like architecture with fabric--it's one of the neatest dances I've ever seen.

However, this also narrowly avoids being Mr. Frowny's Compendium of Angry-Faced Dancers:  the potential for inadvertent humour in Goth anything is pretty high.  There are a lot of dances in this, that on second viewing are technically very sound--and the first time you watch them, they remind you of your friends who used to make fun of the Goth kids.

So, watch this for the innovative clothes and dances, and the technical brilliance, but also notice what makes you want to laugh the first time you see it--there are some really good dancers in this that miss the mark for taking what they are doing over the top just a little bit.  (The live snake?  I really worry about the live snake.)

Despite its foibles, this is very inspiring;  it's one to watch over and over.  I kept hoping that all the dancers on this had their own teaching DVD's.",1228003200,,997,4.613636363636363
2893703,3,B000T2OWWG,"This DVD has a few great performances.  Several good performances.  And a couple that made me wonder what in it is considered belly dance.  Camera angles don't get too weird, lighting is creative, choreography is fun to watch, the songs are interesting and varied to say the least. I have had the great privilege to take a seminar with Ariellah and she is my favorite.  I was happy to have purchased this used, however, paying full price would have been disappointing.  All in all, I enjoy it for the price I paid and have watched it twice in the 2 weeks I've had it.  I totally plan on using a few steps in my own choreography. I would certainly recommend this DVD.",1226620800,,666,4.418032786885246
2893704,5,B000T2OWWG,"This is a mind-blowing production and a must have in every goth bellydancer's collection. Whether you're just delving into the world of raqs gothique or just a goth enthusiast, this is the video for you.

My favorite highlights: Jeniviva at the masquerade ball, Sera and Solstice dancing to ""Lobeknocker"", Mavi as the dark blue winged creature of the night, and a very interesting performance involving Viking maces swinging in time to a punk rock version of ""Shashkin"".",1217635200,2,470,5.103896103896104
2893705,5,B000T2OWWG,"I really enjoyed this one!  It is not all bellydance, though.  There is a lot of interpretive dance, but I really enjoyed watching it!  My son thought parts of it were ""a little too weird"", but he is not a fan of modern dance.  I will say that if you love Halloween and love bellydance,
GET THIS!  I have to show this one to my favorite ""Halloweenies""!  I just know they will ask me to perfom something similar!  Get ready for your Haflaweens girls!",1213920000,,449,4.273809523809524
2893706,4,B000T2OWWG,"Getting interested in bellydance had me surfing the youtube videos. I was actually looking for Tribal Fusion when I cam across WDNY Gothic Bellydance. I was intrigued, so I ordered one. The dances are very dark, captivating, sensual, some are even quirky like ""Dear Ghoul"" and I really liked ""march of the dead""- Freakin creepy! The dancers are talented, and although there is a fine line when to call it bellydance, (I could call it ancient connections fusion). The music is great! I bought a couple of the music CD's, Like Corvus Corax and House of Xymox. You gotta like Goth to like this Vid, or at least be appreciative of experimental dance. I do! I dare you to see it!",1209427200,2,674,4.578512396694215
2893707,5,B000T2OWWG,"Even though I am not a goth person, I still bought this DVD out of curiosity. I actually liked a lot. Even though a few (very few) of the performances were boring and repetitious, the great majority of the dancers came up with some unique and out of the ordinary numbers and costuming. For Goth, Laura Rose and Shakra were the hard core real thing. The others brought out their dark side expressing it in their own individual way. I loved Blanca's performance in the black costume and Elsa Leandros idea of using cane or stick dance steps applying them to the Medieval spiked flail maces is pretty cool. I was particularly impressed with her Turkish drop while swirling those things at full speed. Great zills also. My favorite was Ariellah, I just love the way she moves. Overall, I'm glad I bought this DVD.",1203206400,5,809,4.586206896551724
2893708,3,B000T2OWWG,"I was really quite disappointed by this DVD overall. There are some real highlight dances (and they luckily make up for the rest) which is why I've given it 3 stars. The performances which held my attention and had more variety of pace were Ariellah, Sashi, Shakra, Sera & Solstice. I also liked the Mata Hari Dance by Sarah Skinner which was interesting and told a story, and Elsa Leandros dance was mesmerising if only to see if the spiked balls would hit anything. The rest felt very much that they were 'posing' and 'posing with props' and with little real skill or substance in the dances, or they lacked pace and variety. I would have liked to have seen more of a story and links between the dances - The Dark Masquerade with the Venetian masks hinted at a mystery which never materialised...",1200873600,5,798,4.548611111111111
2893709,4,B000T2OWWG,"I was very excited to see this come out and finally got my hands on a copy.  I ignored most of the whiny reviews about ""that's not bellydance"" or ""platform boots suck"" or ""black does not make goth"".

Some pieces were exceedingly tough to watch. As much as I like Tempest, for some reason I wasn't able to handle watching her dances on this very well. They were too slow and too homogenous, if that makes sense. Granted, both were different, but for some reason, they put me off. Elsa Leandros is another tough-to-watch performer. It took me multiple tries to watch. The costuming was rather unflattering and the morning stars made her look very clumsy and unattractive. Once she switched to zills (I got this far on the 4th time I tried to watch it), she opened up and it was much easier to watch.

On the other hand, there were some performances on this DVD that I just CANNOT get enough of. Shakra's set, for instance. Creepy-cool.....kinda Clockwork Orange feel for the first half of the set. Then switching to a very earthy african- style fusion. It's incredible. Sera and Solstice do an impressive performance. I'm not a fan of East Coast Tribal or Sera so much, but this is another dance that I just cannot get enough of. It's precise (though one of the dancers seems intent on being off anywhere it's not sharp precision), and it's breathtaking.

As for the rest: Ariellah is fantastic as always, as is Neon. Blanca has some incredible work, and Jeneviva is fun. Maiiah and Isis, while both incredible dancers, seemed out-of-place on this DVD, but the performances are very nice to watch.

All in all, I'd say it's worth it. Just remember things like ""This is tribal-fusion"" and ""This is gothic bellydance which is very much it's own thing"" and ""Must have an open mind"". I don't regret owning this in the slightest.",1200614400,4,1822,4.628482972136223
2893710,3,B000T2OWWG,"I have to say, I was just a tad disappointed in the DvD. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that great either. Some of the dances were not really related to bellydancing. I think it could have been better, but I think Revelations was much better than 'Gothic BellyDance - The Darker Side of Fusion.'",1200096000,3,297,4.321428571428571
2893711,4,B000T2OWWG,"My,my, the versatility of belly dance. From snakes, to keys that unlock things,basically the elements are there,
it is just taken into a deeper realm, perhaps one that most are not ready for.
Gothic? Not all of it. Merely a blending of a rainbow colored in different hues, expressing dance as movement, embraced by those who love it.
This is a performance dvd, with many well known belly dancers. There is tremendous talent and artistry in the hour and about 45 minutes. I found this dvd entertaining, the performances original, some predictable, and others trendy and right for the day.
If I had to choose a favorite, Blanca and Sera and her group deserve to split the blue ribbon for best choreography and Ayshe and Blanca in the veil number are tops for creativity.
As a dancer, upon reveiwing the dvd, I focus on my personal love for the art and try to find the positive- such as learning new combinations,adapting to non-traditonal styles,and appreciating the love and expression from the dancer herself. It is her pulse, her heartbeat, her rhythm and interpretation for the world to see. She is the instrument being played by the music- full of variety and variety is the spice of life.",1196985600,3,1192,4.763285024154589
2893712,3,B000T2OWWG,"I was really excited when this came in but I have to say I was kind of disappointed. I don't dislike it but it's not something I want to watch again, the first one was. Some of the performers on here I have seen enough to be able to guess what moves they are going to do and when, and I don't like that. Some of it did not seem gothic at all to me. The platform boots worked for some people but against others, making a usually fluid dancer seem clumsy. I was impressed that there was a slightly older dancer on here but I don't think the music actually fit her style. If I saw her do her usual style I bet she would be quite impressive. Anyway, it's not bad but I don't really care for, I'm going to see if one of my friends wants it.",1196553600,4,735,3.9066666666666667
2893713,5,B000T2OWWG,"I loved this performance video.  The sheer number of dances and the exquisite variety in Gothic styles make this a great value.  All of the dancers are professionals and most have solo videos that are separate from this compilation.  The music is appropriate and the camera work complements the dances and the dancers.  I have 3 tribal type performance DVDs and this one is my favorite.  The other two are:  ""Evolution"" and ""Bellydance Underworld"".  To really understand the genre purchase all three if you can.

8207601,4,B000T2OWWG,"The producers of this CD have made good some of the more egregious flaws in their first effort, and this is a much better overall selection.  Bellydance has been advertised for a long time as a good way for ladies to keep fit, and certainly all the ladies who perform here are fit (in both the U.S. and British senses of the word) and most of them are beautiful (a few are starting to show their age), although they strut their Goth creds with a lot of synthetic falls, Transmuter platform boots and tattoos.  AND most important, most of them seem like they really enjoy what they're doing, especially Neon, who has a impish air even when she's being serious, and Jeniviva.  If you're expecting something involving obsession with sadness and death, it's not really here any more than it is in a lot of what's ""Goth"" - the performances have a wide range, from classical bellydance to artistic wanderings reminiscent of Isadora Duncan with hip-swinging added.  Some of it is impressionistic, some of it is evocative, some of it is erotic (although certainly not pornographic),and some of it is frankly puzzling (at least to me).  Everyone will have their own favorites here, and mine range with those of other reviewers - the two ladies mentioned, Ariellah, Maiiah, Shakra and Tempest. But all in all, this is a good selection for getting introduced to the field as well as a good buy for the price (24 performances, several of which involve more than one song).  Some highlights: the three girls of Shakra lurching around like hip-swinging zombies to ""March of the Dead""; devil-horned Ariellah shaking it to ""Cold Room"" while wielding two burning tapers (no, it's not flaming baton-twirling); Maiiah, with a realistic-looking python draped around her, undulating like she has some snake blood herself to ""Khundas""; Mavi belly-dancing to ""Akkadian"" with a (presumably non-sharp) scimitar balanced delicately on her head; and the true classical bellydance of Isis to ""Blood Oil Gold"" (try watching it with the sound off to get an appreciation of the delicacy of her hand and arm movements).  As the inimitable Liisa Ladouceur puts it, Goth girls ""who prefer their hip skirt made out of fishnets"" are a growing factor in bellydance and they could do a lot worse than to start here, while even non-dancers will appreciate it.",1400371200,,2320,4.888040712468193

8207603,2,B000T2OWWG,"This video is basically just a really, really long dance show.  Some of the dances are interesting, but a lot of them are boring.  Blanca is an amazing dancer, and I bought this dvd when I saw that she was in it. But, she is not featured dominantly as the cover might suggest.  I was hoping that there would be drills or a choreography to learn, but there are not.  This dvd does not seem to be put together in a professional manner, some of the dances are even interrupted by strange video sequences.  This video could be much better.  This is not to say that the dancers are not talented beautiful dancers, they just could have been showcased in a more professional way.",1346112000,,672,4.379032258064516
8207604,1,B000T2OWWG,I was hoping for instruction of some variety. The very beginning is like some strange wannabe orgy... and the dances that happen after that aren't anything like I would expect from a published work. I am very disappointed in this. 23 dances? Only 2 I might watch again. Total let down.,1328745600,,285,4.607843137254902
8207605,3,B000T2OWWG,"I guess when I bought this video, I expected it to be new and unusual, but not as unusual as it turned out to be. At first, I was quite surprised and had my finger on the fast-forward button, as some of the dances were really strange, in costume, choice of music, and type of dance.

The first dance was not really a dance at all but an acted segment in which a girl goes to the a gothic masquerade ball only to be transformed into a vampire. This wasn't really unexpected, and they used it to introduce all the dancers, albeit disguised in masquerade masks.

However, when the real dance pieces actually begin, it got too strange, too fast. It was as if the editors of the film wanted to say, ""yeah, this is a gothic DVD so prepare yourself for the REALLY weird!"" I've grown up Goth but even this took some getting used to. The first dance was of a woman, Laura Rose, dressed like a zombie, her costume consisting of mummy-like wrappings, and dancing to some techno-electronica, and doing some rare side-to-side stomach rolls, while making grotesque facial expressions. It was a bit hard for me to watch, especially since I am a fan of the more traditional belly dance, so I ended up skipping that and skip it every time I watch the dvd.

The second dance tones it down more with Sarah Skinner, who is wearing a much better costume, one that resembled something from old films of belly dancers (but not in the Victorian fusion style, this was more like a cross between a Pharaonic and Indian style costume). I had a problem with two things in this dance, however (and remember that this is only the second dance!) one is that she was doing some kind of pagan worship imitation. I'm all for portrayal of other religions, however, I'd like to watch a dance without feeling as though I have to try to understand the religious significance of it, if any. Second, she starts doing a type of story-telling style of stripping, perhaps as women's sexual liberation statement, which was also not what I expected a belly dance story to be about, at least, in the beginning of the video when audiences are expected to warm up to the dances first before being thrown into all these debatable subjects.

From then on, there is a decent variation of performances, fusions and styles, costumes, choices of music, and level of professionalism. I have something good and bad to say about all of them. Blanca's dance failed to impress me. I think she was doing too much of everyone; too much costume, too much kicking and punching the air, and was overall unconvincing. Her second dance, in which she wears white, was much better and had more story to it, but was not really belly dance at all.

Shakra's two consecutive numbers did not contain much belly dancing either, but their acts of behaving like less-than-human beings (weird smiling creatures in the first, zombies in the second) were quite convincing, and I found that I liked them despite being unusual and devoid of belly dance.

Ayshe and Adrienne's dance of a sorceress and amazonian warrior was rather neat, but the pretend fighting and stabbing got boring quick, and the warrior's thong costume was distracting. I would have preferred if she at least covered her butt more.

Se'Elayssa had a great dance, though she could have followed the music a bit better, but I could tell that she is very talented. Her costume was neat and resembled a cross between a mermaid's outfit and a tribal belly dance outfit. I liked the silver choli top. The music was good until it got repetitive, blowing out my sub woofer, almost.

Both of Mavi's dances were sub-par. She made Mille Anni Passi Sunt into a rather boring dance, instead of bringing out the song's true power and seductiveness, and her sword dance was basic at best. To be honest, no one would have noticed her absence.

Sera and Solstice do a hip-hop number in tribal-inspired costumes. I think it could have been better; it lacked any kind of wow factor. They just looked a bit stale.

Ariellah has great stage presence and very subtle movements, but she could have chosen better songs in my opinion. The Hidden Cage was kind of hard on my ears.

Sashi irritated me and I often skip over her numbers. She seems to be undergoing a bit of a rut in her life, at first glance, because she is not a young woman, yet she attempts to hide this with way too much make-up and way too much costume, which is half-hidden beneath her dreadlocks and fake fairy wings. On top of this, the songs she chose to dance to seem like the type of songs a rebellious adolescent would listen to, one of which was titled ""Slut"". If Sashi lost some of her over-powering costume pieces and chose better lyrics (or none) I might have watched her.

Tempest, in all the performances I've ever seen her in, I was never pleased with her. She is so lacking in grace, her movements stiff and her face stale. She falls short in just about all categories, from presence to persona to dance style, and just seems to be borrowing from other dancers rather than having her own unique style. Sadly, viewers will have forgotten her.

Maiiah's dance was, well, alot of costume and not enough dance. She begins the dance completely covered in a druid robe, then awkwardly does a type of peep show from beneath it, then later appears with a snake. As much as I love snakes, she did not know how to control it, and the snake can be seen taking hold of her arm and forcing it down so that she could not dance properly. They even cut the scene, moved the snake, and had her continue the choreography from there. The change is well edited but close observers will notice.

The warrior dance with Elsea was something that, at first, I was like ""what is this?"" but then I felt drawn to the concept. While I end up skipping the dance most of the time because of the annoying rock music and brutish appearance of the woman (who is not young) I feel as though she could really kill me if she wanted. If it wasn't for the awful rock music, I might have enjoyed this one more, simply because she pulled off the persona well.

This is the first time I've seen Neon, and needless to say, I was impressed. Though, her song ""Dance of Mind"" leaves you wondering if she was originally dancing to another song but they dubbed over it with this (which is a story recited, which doesn't make much sense to me, but I think it's about a secret spy who is a Russian vampire that falls in love with a NY cop/agent, or something). Her first costume would do well without the leaves, then it would be perfect, lace-up sidings, spikes, and all.

Sherene Vismaya was amateur at best, gracelessly throwing around a veil, made worse by her annoying top-knot, awkward stares into the camera, and cheesy music that one might find in an old cartoon portraying stereotypical ""fat Arabs riding camels"". She really does a good job at embarrassing herself; I truly felt embarrassed for her. She has as much belly dance talent as my one-year-old daughter.

Lastly, Isis was a dancer featured all the way at the end of the video. She had great talent, but were hidden beneath too many layers of clothing. She chose to wear a kind of chainmail veil/coif and a plain, black long-sleeved choli, and tied in the front to hide her belly more than it was already hidden. She could have gotten a better position if they moved her dance toward the middle of the dvd, but I feel like people might be tempted to skip her into the credits, especially since her song is rather calming and quiet.

In conclusion, this video is not for the ""faint of heart""; people who are looking for traditional or near-traditional dances, or who are looking for absolutely flawless performances, because there is plenty of mistakes and flaws in this video. Camera work is okay except that the zooming in and out is done with a shaky camera, but you will be able to see all of the dancers. Occasionally the backdrops overpower  the dancer, like Isis, already wearing black, put against a black backdrop, or Sherene put against a bright red backdrop (if you plan on not skipping her altogether). Also, if they reordered some of the dances so that viewers have a chance to settle in with the unusual themes before throwing in the weird stuff, it would have been better for first-time viewers. As for me, it took a while to grow into it, and I could have easily watched it once and then left it on the shelf to be forgotten or ignored, but I gave it a second chance. I still end up skipping some scenes, even though I've had this dvd for a year now.",1316304000,,8534,4.515544041450777
8207606,2,B000T2OWWG,"After watching a myriad of gothic bellydance videos on youtube, I was severely disappointed by this DVD. Ariellah's routines were great, as were Shakra's, but that was about it.

Neon's, in particular, will make you wonder what the hell you bought. Her first 'number', set to an incredibly obnoxious track of talking and rhythm, has an interlude of what looks like MSPaint comics. Yeah, seriously.

And then there's the ""Feminine""...things. Which are, at best, ridiculous and at worst, obnoxious and boring as hell. Unless you're interested in watching some sparkle-clad chick run around and fondle herself in a bodysuit, two badly painted ladies wiggle around a bedsheet for five minutes, or whatever that last one was (I skipped it, I couldn't take it anymore), either avoid this DVD entirely, or be ready to punch the ""Skip"" button frequently. Very frequently.",1315785600,,863,5.1571428571428575
