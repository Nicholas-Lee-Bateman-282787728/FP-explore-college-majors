5881526,5,B00E00W4QE,"We own 3 of his c.d.s and my girls listen to them over and over. He is funny, engaging, and seems to have a grasp on teen culture. We watched this for family night and we all laughed a lot.",1388707200,,189,3.75
5881527,5,B00E00W4QE,"I'm a big Hank Smith fan. He is an excellent teacher, has excellent stories, and he has an excellent spirit about him. I've listened to his CD's (which are all WONDERFUL!), and the DVD did not disappoint. It was fun to see his expressions as he talked. Even though his target age group is the teenager (12-18-ish), as a 33-year-old parent of kids under 7, I really enjoyed watching it. It's a great reminder to stick to your values, AND it will help me as I'm raising my kids. Hank Smith is entertaining and definitely worth watching for anyone any age!",1380153600,,553,4.485148514851486
5881528,5,B00E00W4QE,"I discovered Hank Smith while searching for audio discs for my family to listen to on road trips. I have since become a huge fan. He has an exciting, funny, warm way of getting my kids' attention and teaching them how to live high standards and be good people. Hearing Hank Smith is great, and seeing and hearing Hank Smith is fantastic. My children frequently quote or reenact all the Hank Smith stories they know.  I love the one about taking Sarah to breakfast on this DVD! Can't wait for the next one!  mmm-hmmm, Amen!",1380067200,,522,4.484210526315789
5881529,5,B00E00W4QE,"I have a family with 5 kids ages 3 to 18 and we all loved this DVD.  It is the perfect length and Hank Smith's sense of humor keeps you engaged the whole time.  His connection with teens is wonderful.  My 18 year old introduced us to Hank and now his voice is heard in our cars, and in our home.  It's one thing to listen to his stories, but it's amazing to hear his stories and watch his facial expressions as he tells them.  When I would listen to his CDs I would often say, ""I wish I could see his face while he tells this story.""  And then my daughter saw Hank's DVD.  She bought it immediately and we watched it immediately.  A definite must, especially if you have teens (I have 3).  I Recommend this DVD and all of Hank's CDs.  You'll find yourself laughing as you recall his great stories.",1380067200,3,797,4.116883116883117
5881530,5,B00E00W4QE,"Listeners will not be disappointed. If you've never listened to Hank Smith, check out You Tube and then buy this DVD. Hank speaks at many Especially For Youth Conferences. These conferences are attended by many Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints youth. You don't need to be a member of the church though to understand many of the concepts that Hank speaks about. It is relevant for mainly 12-18 years old. However adults will definitely be able to relate. This is great to watch as a family or have the kids watch it on road trips. Either way you will probably watch it more than once. Even better share it with a friend or extended family.",1376870400,2,649,4.555555555555555

8599677,5,B00E00W4QE,"What is not to love about Hank Smith?!  We've listened to many of his CDs and decided to get a DVD so our family could watch him give his presentation.  It was wonderful.  He is a great speaker for youth and adults.  He is funny, and does great impersonations of some fun characters that teenagers and adults can easily relate to - our whole family (with young kids, teenagers, and adults) all love to listen to his CDs and DVD.  He speaks about great values and ideas and would be beneficial for anyone, no matter race or religion.  Thank you Hank Smith from Utah!",1471564800,,565,4.384615384615385
