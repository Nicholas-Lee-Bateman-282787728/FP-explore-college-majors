4979367,5,B0068RZD42,"I don't normally review movies, or write about them, but this was just a great documentary. If you love boxing, you will recognize a couple of faces in the sport. The interviews are inspiring because that is exactly what boxers think. It really is the only sport that is world renowned and anyone can understand it, but not many people can participate. It requires a certain love for it, and as a boxer myself it was really heart felt and really put together well for others to get an inside of the sport. I highly recommend this documentary to any fan of boxing.",1342051200,2,563,4.475728155339806
4979368,5,B0068RZD42,"Before I watched this film I had no idea about a subculture of legal and non legal Hispanic immigrants, boys and girls, who box to find their way to grasp the ""American Dream"" as so many other ethnic groups have done in the past. Not only does the writer, producer, and director, Justin Frimmer, unfold his outstanding skills in film making, he also captures the up close ""shots"" and sounds of real boxing and especially the battle about young men seeking to develop their potential. This film evolves into a awareness of the struggles by each of the characters, some in a good home, and others off the streets, to make it to the top as well as conquer the fight within. This documentary will open up your mind and provoke thoughts about the day to day struggles each ethnic group(Jews, Irish, African Americans, Russians, Germans, Asians, Hispanics, etc.) have had to endure to come to a nation were you can have a better life and the incredible venues those groups embrace to make the dream come true. In addition Mr. Frimmer saw the potential in a set of twin brothers, one who made it to the Olympics and is now a professional boxer and was recently seen boxing on Showtime, as well as the trainers talent, persistence, connection, and devotion with each of the student boxers. This is another example that if you fight hard enough in this country, do not give up and really try, you can have the American Dream. Go see this one. This film is not only about boxing but a much broader theme that everyone, whether male or female, a boxing fan or not, will understand and will come away with a new insight about a sub-culture that most do not even know exists. You are not only watching an eye opening documentary but seeing the development of the next De La Hoya and a trainer that will go down in history and be known as the person who made winners and Olympic contenders.",1323043200,2,1876,4.520588235294118
