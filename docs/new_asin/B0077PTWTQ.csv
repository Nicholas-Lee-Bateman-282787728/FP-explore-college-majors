5062658,5,B0077PTWTQ,"I like this film. I've always loved animals since i can remember. My only complaint is the ones i really like are short films. I love films well over 1 hour. I like how they threw in all these animals. I live in Alaska so it's always nice to see alaskan animals in National Geographic films. You get to see wolves, bears, caribou, eagles, moose,buffalo, elk, cougar etc in here. I enjoy this film. I have other dvds of different animals of the National Geopgraphic animal films. I have yet to purchase other films.",1380672000,7,514,4.4787234042553195

8512035,1,B0077PTWTQ,"I saw that this DVD was PG.  I assumed that it was for violence (animal kills).  They say a** at least twice, spoke about an animals balls, and used sexual inuendo in the commentary.  I found it completely inappropriate for this movie.  I believed National Geographic to be a completely safe thing to show my children.  I do not feel like this is appropriate for children or to show in a classroom setting.  I was horrified that a movie about animals would be like this.",1524441600,,470,4.470588235294118

8512039,5,B0077PTWTQ,"Movie ranks animals on a ""scale"" of toughness. Pretty good, though. I thought the ""ranking"" system of the animals made it pretty good.",1486252800,,134,4.869565217391305

8512041,3,B0077PTWTQ,"The photography is excellent, but the concept and script are silly, and the experts are there to showboat. America's Greatest Animals? What they mean is America's most fearsome animals. It's an excuse to show interesting footage from their vaults.",1436313600,,247,5.358974358974359
