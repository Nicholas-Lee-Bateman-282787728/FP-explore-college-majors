7866462,4,6304227523,"I like this tape, and hope that it will be remastered and chaptered on DVD soon.  But, please, Ms. Austin, do not have your commercials in the front--that's the most annoying thing you've done on recent DVDs.

The tape quality, as others have noted, is not the greatest. Why?  Because a lot of her tapes were recorded in Extended Play mode, not Standard Play.  Also, especially in the segments where she is right on the beach, the camera is apparently not anchored very well, and moves a lot (like the weather cameras on the tops of buildings do), which is annoying.

The 10-minute workouts are great--it would be nice if it were issued in a DVD format that allowed you to pick and choose which order you wanted do them in.",1147824000,,723,4.488549618320611
7866463,3,6304227523,"I watch fit & lite on lifetime every morning. Its an easy way to get started on an exercise routine. I wanted to try one of her videos, but the quality is so bad its distracting. I thought there was something wrong with  my vcr, but it was the same on the one in the bedroom. Whoever produced  this video should really pay a little more attention to detail &  quality.",957830400,,368,4.154929577464789
7866464,3,6304227523,"This video is actually 4 x 10 minute work outs.  1. The first set is a warmup for when you have just woken up. It isn't likely to create a sweat though although could still be used to get you motivated.  2. The second  set is a warmdown. It is quite a good set, compared to the rest of the  video.  3. The third set is for a warmup or warmdown. I would use it as a  warmdown and then do a few more stretches. 4. The last 10 minutes is a  relaxing/meditation set. She included some good stretches but it would be  more peaceful if she was quiet for even a moment.
Having written all  this, it is not a bad video and you could use it. I don't believe it is one  of her best.",956534400,2,672,3.8394160583941606
