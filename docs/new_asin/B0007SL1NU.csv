8051107,5,B0007SL1NU,"Lupin continues his escapades in this volume involving four jobs and pulling double duty in a two parter.

I Melt With You
-Lupin is in a pinch this go-round. Torn between his love of the world's largest ruby and his love of his backstabbing love of his life Fujiko. He has a choice; give up the ruby to a man who'll use it to flood the world or let Fujiko die? What's a gentleman thief to do?

Mercy Mercy Me
-Lupin is out again to steal a priceless golden statue from a Japanese Temple. Zenigata's on the case, but he ain't coming alone. Calling upon a seasoned veteran cop who used to hunt Lupin himself. This duo of crime fighters may be able to put their half-wits together and snatch their long time foe

Kookie Kabuki Pt. 1 & 2
-How does one steal from the world's greatest thief? The Gang of Five are out to prove that. These thieves are wicked yet honorable and are out to rip off Lupin's score of the 36 Views of Mt. Fuji. Even worse, Goemon throws his lot in with them! With Goemon playing the traitor and Fujiko the damsel in distress, this Kabuki show may be the curtain call of Lupin's career

Alter-Ego Maniac
-Things are rotten in the status quo. Lupin's always been a little hot-headed at times, but murdering targets of his heists in cold blood? Has Lupin finally tossed his moral compass or is something more sinister at play?

Gettin' Jigen With It
-A heist for some ice is all in a day's work for Lupin and co. But stealing it from a ballerina in the middle of Soviet Russia with trigger happy communist soldiers is another story. Lupin gets the ice, but an unlucky Jigen gets the girl. Now it's a race to the border with all of Mother Russia on their tail, Jigen always pays his debts, but this may be one where he comes up short.",1523664000,,1752,4.296969696969697

Anyway, this very nice and clearly out-of-production DVD is a real treat.  It contains episodes #53 ~ #58 of the second Lupin III TV series, which are all fun episodes.  My only real complaint here is that I've never been fond of the supposedly 'clever' changes made to the titles of the episodes.  Really now, why was that even necessary?  Also, as can be seen in the case of episodes #55 & #56 (a rare Lupin III two-parter) - renamed 'Kooky Kabuki' - they can get almost disturbingly patronizing.

Here are the REAL titles:

#53: ""The Mad Fantomas Mark III""
  Another descendant of a fictional character - in this case Marcel Allain & Pierre Souvestre's Fantomas - is brought to the screen, then sent over the top and completely out of control.
#54: ""Detective Hanshichi's Ten-Year Promise""
  Lupin has a run-in with a detective he first met when he was younger.
#55: ""Falling Cherry Blossoms - The Mysterious Gang of Five (Part One)""
  A gang of five thieves claims to represent traditional Japanese values, and they sucker Goemon into turning against Lupin.
#56: ""Falling Cherry Blossoms - The Mysterious Gang of Five (Part Two)""
  Continuation of the above.
#57: ""The Computer or Lupin""
  Zenigata begs for Lupin's help in returning some coins he stole that had once belonged to his own ancestor, Heiji Zenigata.
#58: ""The Border is a Look of Farewell""
  Jigen is stuck behind enemy lines in the Soviet Union and can only escape with the help of a ballerina who hopes to defect to the United States.  As I recall, this episode created a bit of controversy with its less-than-flattering portrayal of the USSR.",1460678400,,1757,4.717105263157895

8051111,5,B0007SL1NU,"Now that I have 79 episodes, I'm waiting for episodes 80-155 to be in English dubbed. I love the Geneon voice actors that do better with Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, Goemon and Zenigata. I hope Discotek Media will get Lupin the 3rd (2nd TV series) episodes 1-155 on DVD soon.",1417478400,,268,4.489795918367347
8051112,4,B0007SL1NU,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average. I will wait for next volume.,1142467200,,891,4.681528662420382
8051113,5,B0007SL1NU,"In these episodes, the animation is improved from what was shown on adult swim, and there's some interesting character development as well as great plots!

6 entertaining episodes are on this volume.

Episodes on Vol. 11 are (titles are translation of the Japanese titles, actual titles on the DVD might be different):

53. The Mad Fantoma Mark III
54. Detective Hanshichi's Ten-Year Promise
55. Falling Cherry Blossoms - The Mysterious Gang of Five (Part I)
56. Falling Cherry Blossoms - The Mysterious Gang of Five (Part II)
57. Will It Be the Computer or Lupin?
58. The Border Is the Face of Farewell (AKA International Farewell)

Awesome episodes! Goemon challenges Lupin for a duel in the episode ""Falling Cherry Blossoms - The Mysterious Gang of Five (Part II)."" Jigen gets a little more screen time in ""International Farewell."" Lupin and Fujiko's relationship is tested in ""The Mad Fantoma Mark III."" More fun an action in this volume than most previous ones! You can't pass this one up.

The volume has an English dub as well as the original Japanese with English subtitles, so you can see the episodes in their original form if you wish.

Overall an amazing set of episodes that has a lot of surprises and character development that'll make for a wonderful evening of entertainment. This is easily the best volume out of the 11 currently released!",1108944000,9,1356,4.873913043478261
