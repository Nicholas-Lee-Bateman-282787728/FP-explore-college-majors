185637,5,1563453789,"This was a beautiful short overview of Maine.  I enjoyed the scenery and brief narrated segments.  While watching I paused several times to google islands, lakes, and towns mentioned.  My imagination and curiosity were sparked by this film.",1417737600,,240,5.2631578947368425
185638,3,1563453789,"My complaint is that they should have spent more time on the ground at each general area of interest. There was too much to see in a single video and it felt rushed, maybe they should have divided the state into geographical areas and focused one video on each area. Reducing the number of  highlighted areas in total on each video to do each area justice. This would have yielded three or more videos, but each video would have been more interesting and given potential visitors a better idea of what was available and allowed them to decide what area they wanted to visit. After all a weeks vacation could never cover the entire state.

Puts new meaning on the term 'fly-over'.",1409443200,,679,4.557377049180328

185640,5,1563453789,I enjoyed the videography as well as the commentary.  For someone who is from New England and now living in California it brings back wonderful memories of Maine.  It would also be an excellent introduction to the beauty of Maine for someone who was thinking about vacationing in Maine.  I recommend it very highly for anyone who just appreciates the ocean and a rocky coast.,1369180800,,375,4.7384615384615385
185641,5,1563453789,This DVD is great. It is very relaxing and interesting. I have never been to Maine but this video sure does make me want to visit. It's well done with excellent narration from Jack Perkins. It also lacks the annoying soundtrack high on Maine has. Great from start to finish!,1274140800,2,274,4.5
