2582448,1,B000FQJPRI,"My son absolutely loves Elmo, so I thought that this would be a good way to purchase more of his dvd's.  You can't beat three for the price of two, or so I thought.  Head to Toe is obviously an early one, the set isn't very good and Mr. Noodle is a little creepy.  The others are better, but a little more annoying than the dvd's I already have.  They use Elmo's camcorder too much and it makes me a little motion sick.  But my son doesn't seem to mind.  The Pets segment is also included on one of the best dvd's, so I have two dvd's with it now.  I think that the Families, Mail, & Bath Time, and the Pets (Pets, Dogs, & Cats) are way better.  My son thinks so too.  He doesn't really like the new ones in the set.  It's definitely not the ""best"" of Elmo.  It's the dvd's that they couldn't sell individually.",1174953600,47,811,4.037735849056604
2582449,5,B000FQJPRI,My kid (18 months) and I (30 years old) love Elmo and this DVD collection is great.  9 episodes of Elmo.  Lots of fun.  Recommand to all Elmo's fan !!!,1174608000,,151,3.966666666666667
2582450,5,B000FQJPRI,My grandchildren just love all the elmo videos.  My daughter says it really keeps them occupied even after the unpteen time.,1173312000,2,124,4.904761904761905
2582451,5,B000FQJPRI,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a 2 year old and he loves them all. They are the typical Elmo video. If you child has seen one before and likes it, then they will be sure to like these.",1171411200,,190,3.658536585365854
2582452,5,B000FQJPRI,well everyone knows Sesame Street... these DVD's are cute and funny and my daughter loves watching them over and over again. and they're not too annoying as a background track for Mom and Dad which is a significant plus in my book.,1170288000,2,231,4.523809523809524
2582453,5,B000FQJPRI,"My 21-mo-old daughter is absolutely obsessed with Elmo, so this 3-pack was the best DVD investment we ever made.  Each DVD has three episodes of ""Elmo's World"", each episode focusing on a different topic.

Topics are:

Disc 1 - Jackets, Hats and Shoes

Disc 2 - Birthdays, Games and Pets

Disc 3 - Flowers, Bananas and Hair

Anyone who has ever seen an episode of ""Elmo's World"" will know what to expect.  Every episode has the same format, so the 'repitition' criticized in an earlier review shouldn't come as a surprise to a regular Elmo viewer.  And, as each episode is at least 15 minutes long, I certainly wouldn't expect an active toddler to sit through the entire disc (nearly 50 minutes).

So, if your child is a fan of the ""Elmo's World"" segment at the end of every episode of Sesame Street, this collection is a must.",1165104000,291,827,4.533783783783784
2582454,3,B000FQJPRI,"My son loves Elmo, his favorite is Kid's Favorite Songs 2. I thought by getting the 3pk of DVDs it would be MORE, but no it's NOT. It's just three different themes w/ the same pattern & format as the other 2 ( in the pack). Talk, sing a song, show somes pictures. Kid's I would think like variety,not repetition. The movies lose my son's attention. I find him wandering off somewhere. (He is 18 months). Sure he picks up new words here & there, but I expected way more. DISAPPOINTED. But I highly recommenD Kids Favorite Songs 2, I love it,my husband loves it, & my son, we all sing together. Get it ASAP.

2582459,4,B000FQJPRI,"Pretty nice quality. After one show ends the next one immediately starts, but each one doesn't have the beginning song before each show.

I got this for my 5 months old nephew and he hasn't been able to watch it because it says it only plays in the USA and Canada. So it pops up a message saying to check the region code..

2582487,3,B000FQJPRI,"My daughter loves these DVD's so we got her these for watching in the car. Unfortunately 1 of the 3 disc's was already broken when we opened the package (thus the rating) so we paid a high price for just 2 watchable DVD's. I know we can return the whole set but we're stationed overseas and it's a huge headache to ship stuff back out and it likely won't arrive back stateside for well over a month. Hopefully we can find the Birthday, Games and More DVD elsewhere by itself as a replacement for her.",1387929600,,500,4.273684210526316

There are three videos in the package, and they each have three different topics, so you aren't constantly changing out the videos, to put in another!  I also loved the fact that they are ""grouped"" into same categories and not just hodge-podges of collected episodes.

I bought this collection and took it with us on a recent family vacation so that we would have somethling to entertain her when needed. She just loved it!

My husband and I wanted to get our daughter a variety of other Elmo's World dvds, mainly because we had the first one memorized so we also needed something new. She absolutely loves Elmo. He is her favorite Sesame Street character. It keeps her entertained while I cook dinner. Every time we come home from daycare the first thing she says as we walk in the door is ""Elmo!""

She has the elmo doll. I highly recommend the Elmo and Abby's Birthday Fun dvd too. Abby Cadabby is her 2nd favorite character.

I watched them with her and I liked what was taught and in the way they did it as it keept her attention and excitement for longer than I thought possible, teaching always good things. Looking for other videos like those I could not believe I found this set of 3 for the price of one.

My only problem was that with one of the dvd's, there must have been a production error because it freezes and then skips a bit during one of the segments. It did that the first time we put it in, so I know that it wasn't because we scratched it.

He just loves Elmo and the whole cast, who are each exciting and interesting as only a little, red, furry monster can be to a child. (Wait ... that's another episode ... involving a parade ...)
Anyway, Elmo is a great educational tool and my son's personal favorite character in the known universe ... well, it's a tie between Elmo, Mr Noodle and Dorothy. And since my son has only been in the U.S. for two months and doesn't speak much English yet, that is definitely saying something.

2582570,5,B000FQJPRI,"Elmo's World is exactly what the title states; each episode illustrates how the world is seen through the eyes of a young child (or a cute furry red monster).  Elmo and his pet fish Dorothy tackle everyday objects and concepts (e.g., pets and birthdays) in a lively, colorful environment that resembles a child's crayon drawing.  It is clear that a lot of attention was paid to the detail of each episode (e.g., the aquarium decor in Dorothy's fish bowl is changed to match the subject of each episode).

My daughter absolutely loves these videos, and often requests to share them with her friends at daycare.  As a parent, I am pleased that Elmo's World continues in the great Sesame Street tradition of providing a quality educational program for young children.  Although, I think Elmo's World is targeted to a younger audience than Sesame Street and may be overly simplistic for older preschoolers.",1180396800,3,902,4.907894736842105

One day while flipping through the channels Elmo was on the screen and my daughter stopped in her tracks and was quiet for the entire duration of the episode. I was shocked. I immediately went online to find more dvd's we could use so I could get some cleaning, cooking, and much needed relaxation time.
This DVD collections covers hats, games, shoes, jackets, pets and so much more. We only watch one or two episodes a day but with this collection it's as if we never have to repeat the same episode. My older daughter watches Spongebob and I'm convinced she watches the same three episodes recycled. I prefer variety and mixing up the episodes and educational experiences.
My 13 month old prefers Elmo to any other Sesame Street character and she actually laughs whenever Mr. Noodle is on. I'd recommend this to anyone. It's even pretty entertaining to the parents and doesn't annoy me like a lot of other shows. Fundamental learning tools. No wonder it's been around so long.",1462924800,2,1148,4.7164179104477615
