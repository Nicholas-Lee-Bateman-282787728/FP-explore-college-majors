4653664,5,B005CNSJ3K,I really enjoyed the Da Vinci Code and found this to be an awesome companion piece to the film. This is basically like going backstage and seeing the raw materials from which the story was constructed. For those who want to know more about the life of Christ as I did I think you'll find this an invaluable resource.,1368835200,2,316,4.372881355932203
4653665,5,B005CNSJ3K,I found this dvd when looking to buy the original movie. I was pleasantly surprised and have rewatched this video a couple of times. Check it out.,1354492800,,146,4.444444444444445
4653666,4,B005CNSJ3K,"The bloodline of Christ is an incredibly relevent subject, with all the natural disasters and political upheaval today it is more important than ever to fully understand the man that was Christ.  This covers as much as is known on the subject.",1353369600,,243,4.785714285714286
4653667,4,B005CNSJ3K,"The DaVinci Code Exposed -

This is a 3-disc set looking into the source material behind The DaVinci Code, starting with the murder of Mary Magdalene!  From there we go to the Knights Templar and the secret bloodline of Jesus, then on to numerous numerological codes and a whole bunch of other hints at the truth, if you can handle it.  Lots of clues indicate exactly what I'm not sure, in the first disc led by none other than Dan Green, who wrote the DaVinci Code--but wait, that was Dan Brown, wasn't it?  A bit confusing, but it looks like this fellow Callum Jensen is having a bit of a hoot calling himself Dan Green as he describes (this part's serious, I think) how the Gothic Cathedral of Lincoln, England, fits into the whole conspiracy.

Professor Hugh Montgomery is up next.  His research into the genealogy of Jesus is a fascinating mystery, told well.  He connects Jesus to the Vikings, European royal families, George Washington and even himself.

The final DVD is an extensive interview with Tim Wallace-Murphy, whose book was one of the sources of Dan Brown's DaVinci Code.  Right off the bat Wallace-Murphy praises Brown's book as a wonderful work of fiction.  Then he goes on to discuss the scholarship behind The DaVinci Code--both his and other sources.  But beyond that, he talks about religion in general, reminiscent of the Joseph Campbell interviews with Bill Moyers.  For my money, this third disc is golden and worth the price of admission, even if you don't ever bother with the first two.",1321488000,3,1516,4.744274809160306

8465691,1,B005CNSJ3K,SUCKS BIG TIME!!!!!,1522627200,,19,5.666666666666667
8465692,2,B005CNSJ3K,Could have been much better with at least an introduction and totally getting rid of horrible background music! Definitely did not need it! It overrode the interview to make it hard to understand. Had to stop watching because of it giving me a headache trying to hear! The content would be good otherwise.,1520985600,,305,4.773584905660377
8465693,1,B005CNSJ3K,"I could not watch more than 10 minutes! There's terrible theme music, then you get thrown into an extremely amateur video interview, with terrible audio and not much better video. Who is this guy being interviewed? Who's the interview being done by? Terrible!",1520467200,4,259,5.046511627906977
8465694,3,B005CNSJ3K,I just watched the first episode.  Sure wish I could have HEARD it!!!!  I struggled the whole way through trying to hear what they were saying.  The music was unnecessary and LOUD!!!!!,1520035200,2,184,4.6875
8465695,3,B005CNSJ3K,Would've been more enjoyable had the music not been playing over the interview sections.,1519948800,2,88,5.357142857142857

8465697,1,B005CNSJ3K,Has great potential but the interview has no introduction. It just sort of throws you into the interview and I'm still not sure who the person being interviewed is. Classical music that is too loud plays throughout the entire interview and most of the time you can't understand what the interviewee is saying through all the music. Totally unnecessary. Not worth the time to watch it unfortunately.,1497139200,2,398,4.955223880597015
8465698,1,B005CNSJ3K,"Terrible audio, amateur video. This is nothing but poorly recorded interviews. Don't waste your money. I threw it away.",1464480000,2,119,5.315789473684211
8465699,4,B005CNSJ3K,I didn't see the movie until long after it had come out in theaters. I've since gone back and read the book and must say this is a great companion piece that brings some fresh insight into the discussion.  Recommended.,1368921600,,218,4.45
