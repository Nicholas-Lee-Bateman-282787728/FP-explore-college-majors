if you like much random jokes and a wizard that says the same word almost every time he use magic then its for you.

even if it can be a little lame some times is it a pretty funny anime so its worth 4 stars",1400630400,,252,3.6666666666666665
3619708,5,B001GT9DR0,It was hilarious and I loved every second of it. It does not follow the manga or continue on from the original but it I vision of its own and completely random. It is good to watch if yo want a laugh. And if you are in a bad mood. Well for me anyway,1399680000,,249,3.6296296296296298
3619709,5,B001GT9DR0,I can say this anime series is good.  Made by Ken Akumatsu the same guy who made Love Hina.  A must have for any anime fan for the good old days.,1398470400,,145,3.6451612903225805
3619710,4,B001GT9DR0,"After reading the rather lurid plot synopsis on Amazon, I nearly passed up this video, but the presence in it of several of my favorite voice-actresses got me to give it a try, and now I'm glad I did.

Firstly, ignore all the talk about ""temptation,"" in the synopsis; the series is quite wholesome. Beyond a couple of schoolgirl crushes, there is no sexual content in the video at all. It is a magical adventure series, and it does that very well indeed.

Only one thing kept me from giving this series the five stars it would otherwise have earned, the presence of my least favorite thing in anime, the comic pages, or anywhere else: talking animals. Aside from the ferret who seems to be channeling Joan Rivers, there is a frog and a cat, though the only way to tell with the latter two is that they say so. These animals add nothing to the show, and could easily have been omitted.

Now for the good stuff. Somehow the writers managed to give each of the 31 students her own personality, something some script-writers can't manage with even four or fives characters. Character development happens mainly with the ten or twelve main students, but even this is a monumental achievement. The story itself, moves right along with elements of mystery and intrigue, and the end of each episode had me impatiently scene-skipping to the start of the next. One warning to parents: there are scary elements which probably wouldn't be suitable for younger children.

You can't tell a book by its cover, and you can say the same for some plot synopses, apparently.",1392163200,,1555,4.664233576642336

3619714,4,B001GT9DR0,"To be honest, I am deeply disappointed by this anime. By giving the name Negima!? see it quite the same as Ken Akamatsu's Negima and it is inspirrert of it. However, it is not similar at all. This is much more barnevennelig and at first seems the biggest threat a flower.

It is not as much ecchi as the original, but it fits so incredibly well with small children.",1384387200,,365,4.2898550724637685
3619715,5,B001GT9DR0,I was hoping that I would've gotten the TV series instead of this but I love it just the same. The TV series has more of a story build up to it whereas this series seems to leave some story lines out that would help make this set a bit more complete. But it's a fun story to watch nonetheless. I'll just get the other series later. It'll make the whole series longer and even more enjoyable. :-),1382745600,,395,4.076923076923077

3619719,4,B001GT9DR0,Great series. Negi is a ten year old professor at an all girls classroom at Mahora academy. That is where the fun begins. The sound track is great.

3619721,5,B001GT9DR0,"This is a really fun anime to watch.  It has a lot of charm to it, and is especially good if you have seen the original Negima anime, so you kind of have an idea about all of the characters.  Many things are done differently, and I think it was done better.  The first series took some things too slow, it seemed, but this one has a great pace to it.",1362960000,,350,3.9014084507042255
3619722,5,B001GT9DR0,"I love Negima!? Especially this season it's so silly, with all the love plots and a little side of seriousness thrown in, and I loved the whole mystery about the Darkness and the star crystal. I wish they had continued it, but I'm reading the manga too which is awesome, so i would recommend this to those who like romance/comedy types of animes",1362528000,,345,4.492063492063492

3619725,5,B001GT9DR0,"exactly what i was looking for!  the story is different from the manga, true, but its still a great story with really charming characters and really bright and well done artwork.  there are over 30 main characters and each one has a distinct personality which makes the whole series fun to keep going through.  the subtitles for the original japanese dub are well done and credit where credit is due, this actually has a really well done english dub!  its know, i was surprised too!  but its genuinely good and quite often funnier than a lot of other shows.  the action is pretty well paced, the music is good and the main character negi is neither arrogant or ignorant, a big bonus",1356739200,,682,4.549180327868853
3619726,4,B001GT9DR0,"I was trying to get the one I saw on Netflix but this one wasn't it. (It was the one they call season 2. which isn't really a second season just a different version of this one)  I did like them both though. This one has more detailed stories about the girls lives and more school related episodes. (the other one is more about the contracts with girls, chupcabra's and magic stuff)",1355875200,,382,4.305555555555555
3619727,4,B001GT9DR0,"Negi Springfield has graduated from magic school and is sent to Japan to further his studies. He ends up being middle school homeroom/english teacher. One of his students, Asuna discovers his secret. If a person discovers his secret magic powers, Negi must make a contract with them by kissing them. This also gives the partner magic powers. Not to long after that he has a run-in with his father's old enemy. With Asuna and a few other girls at his side, Negi can better fight the enemy. Before that happens, pretty much all the girls in his class know the secret of Negi's magic. If he wants to avoid having his magic taken and turned into an animal, he must make a contract with all the girls in his class. Life keep getting more and more complicated for him.

This is a very off the wall series. It combines action, comedy, fantasy, harem, and drama. It's pretty stacked. There was a previous series called Negima. I haven't seen it, but I understand that this is a crazier retelling. You can tell the difference by the ""!?"" after the title. The newer version has the ""!?"" after it. This series is extremely silly. It reminds me a lot of PaniPoni Dash. If you have seen that series, you can expect a similar scenario. The main difference is that we have a boy teacher instead of a girl, and there is a magical world theme as well. The animation in this series is very well done, so is the soundtrack and the voice acting. There are a lot of very cool characters too. This anime has a lot going for it. The only thing they could have improved on is the plot. I think the story gives way to off the wall comedy and silliness most of the time. That's not a bad thing though. This series is still quite good and a lot of fun. I think just about any anime fan can find something to like about Negima!? I highly recommend it!",1353628800,,1823,4.330409356725146

3619729,5,B001GT9DR0,"I really liked this series. People who hate this anime are hard-core manga fans who wanted a story fully based on the manga's story. This version takes a new take of the manga with an original story. The story is very fascinating and i got caught in it fast! I love all  this drama and i firstly watched the entire series on FUNimation's youtube account when they had the whole dub on there. I loved it so much that I just had to buy it!
Story- Negi Springfield is a new professor who is 10 at an all Girl SCHOOL! He is able to make contracts with the girls that give them powers by kissing. A magical item that is very powerful is stolen and the criminal is after Negi! Negi will need some help from all 31 girls in his class to solve this mystery.
If you like Harems and wonderful comedy and animation get this. I highly recommend this series!",1337472000,,845,4.216049382716049
3619730,2,B001GT9DR0,"I usually wait until after I've watched a series a couple of times before attempting to review it, but since that's not likely to happen - at least not anytime soon! - here goes.

First, let me say I AM a fan of: Ken Akamatsu's manga and anime Love Hina ( including the disliked Love Hina - Again anime ); 3/4 of the previous version of Negima!; and most of Moon Phase.  So I had great hopes for THIS - but once again, I find I was mistaken.  Having read some of the manga this is based on, I'd hoped this series would correct the problem I thought the first version suffered from, divergence from the ""original"" storyline.  Instead, Negima!? ( the ? part of the title is well-deserved because you'll be wondering just how any of this could possibly be related to the original Negima! ) almost completely abandons the original story, going off on unending random tangents that do nothing whatsoever to advance any over-arching plot or character development.  Indeed, as with the equally disappointing latest version of Tenchi Muyo!, most of the previously-well established and liked characters ( Asuna, Nodoka, Eva, and others ) are either ignored or suffer considerable personality changes.  ( And to parody Motsu's favorite expression, I DON'T mean that in a GOOD way! )

As all-too-often with anime series based on currently-running manga, there is literally no end in sight, forcing the anime writers to improvise.  With the original series it meant inventing a story arc involving an unlikely ""death"" for one of the main characters, followed by an anticlimactic final episode.  Here, there are repeated crises, climaxes, regressions, reversions, conversions, etc. ad nauseum resulting in a ""who cares"" attitude towards the characters, the setting, and entire storyline.  It doesn't even bother to give any but the barest ""backstory"", and that in the first 3 episodes, assuming viewers are already familliar with characters, situation, and plot from the previous versions.  From that too-little effort it then diverges into its own ""universe"", never to return.  The ONLY saving grace ( though actually a BIG part of the problem ) is the beautiful and clever animation from the same studio and director that gave us Pani Poni Dash and Moon Phase. I thought the original Negima! bore too close a resemblance to Love Hina; the sound and look of Negima!? is totally different, befitting what is in all-but-name a totally different production.  Unfortunately it may be viewed as something of a victory of ""style over substance"", of which there is virtually none. I was only too glad when I'd finally made it all the way through this tedious mess!",1332720000,,2645,4.93018018018018
3619731,1,B001GT9DR0,this is false advertising this is not the second season of negima i read the second season of negima in the manga and he's much older in season 2. this is just a re-image of the first season and this one is boring. stay with the oringinal dvd set season 1. read the manga.,1331510400,,272,4.055555555555555
3619732,4,B001GT9DR0,"This go around for Negima...the show focuses more on the comedy & less on the fan service. There's little to no fan service (not counting the scenes when the contracts are activated). Even though it has a TV-MA rating, to me, children can watch it. My 9yr old nephew loves the show just like me. It's consistantly funny. I can watch this over & over mainly because there's a lot of stuff that the characters say on the sly.",1311292800,,423,4.367088607594937
3619733,4,B001GT9DR0,"Technically, there's already been an anime series -- ""Negima"" -- about preteen wizard/schoolteacher Negi Springfield.

But apparently that isn't stopping them from creating another parallel series, rebooting and revamping Ken Akamatsu's bestselling manga into the visually lush, fantastical ""Negima!?"" (see, the question and exclaimation mark mean it's a different show!). And this series is a vastly different creation -- while it's rarely faithful to the original manga's storylines, it's still a solid fantasy story sprinkled with some fun comic relief. And chupacabras.

Negi has been assigned to a vast all-girls Mahora Academy in Japan -- but things start going wrong before he even starts. Half-asleep student Asuna witnesses a small magical display, and a vampire is attacking students. A vampire who is also his student.

Even worse, the vampire Evangeline and her robotic partner Chachamaru are targeting Negi, since the boy is her only ticket out of a curse that binds her to Mahora. Even worse, her suppressed superpowers come back at the full moon -- and soon Negi's only hope of defeating Evangeline is by forming a Pactio (a magical contract). Asuna is the logical choice since she already knows about his magic, but will the stubborn girl agree before Evangeline's icy magic smashes Mahora?

But there's more trouble when a pair of disguised wizards bring news -- the legendary Star Crystal has been stolen, and it may be related to odd happenings at Mahora. As Negi tries to avoid erminehood, he must deal with a kindly resident ghost, the dangerous Library Island, camping trips with his Pactio partners, and an evil fairy that is attacking the school -- and even transports them to another dimension. Can Negi keep his class safe from whatever has stolen the Star Crystal -- and avoid being turned into an animal?

For the record, ""Negima!?"" isn't very faithful to Ken Akamatsu's original manga -- the first few episodes loosely follow one of his storylines, before spinning off in a totally different direction with the whole Star Crystal storyline. And rather than use the comedy and romantic woes, the first thirteen episodes choose to focus on all the magic that can be crammed into thirteen episodes -- transformations, spells, enslavement, vampires, aerial battles and chupacabras. Well, sort of.

Fortunately ""Negima!?"" never feels overstuffed, even though there's plenty going on here on many levels (personal, magical, and Pactiowise). The various subplots mesh together very smoothly right up to the cliffhanger, and the writers patch in stretches of quiet time where the characters talk, plot and occasionally go to class. And of course, we get some spectacular magical battles and creepy magical creatures, with one highlight being the flashback of Negi's father battling Evangeline in a ruined city.

And though the focus is on magic and action, there's still plenty of comic relief -- chupacabra clubs, meatball-shapoed spies, goofy Pactio transformations, and a hilarious scene where Negi tries fruitlessly to erase Asuna's memory. His life becomes entertainingly chaotic as more and more girls learn of his magic powers, and he's forced to make more and more Pactios.

Even if ""Negima!?"" had a really rotten storyline, it would be worth watching for the simply stunning animation. The entire series is soaked in dark jewel tones and swirling magical spells, with erupting jungles of ice and hedgey mazes where evil creatures lurk. Mahora is a shadowy, vaguely gothic place with lots of dim streets and a city filled with starlike lights. And the level of detail can be breathtaking -- while casting one elaborate spell, Asuna can be seen clearly reflected in Negi's glasses.

Negi proves to be a likable little hero -- earnest, courageous, unselfish and a bit tightly wound, while Asuna proves to be stubborn, brash, eccentric and almost superhumanly strong. And though there's a vast cast, they all get a measure of fleshing out -- Konoka and her hard-nosed bodyguard Setsuna, serene ninja Kaede, bookish Nodoka, and even a ghostly student who's still hanging around. The best is undoubtedly Evangeline -- especially since the writers pause to reveal what a tragic, lonely life she has.

""Negima!?"" is a stunningly animated revamp Negi Springfield's adventures -- and while not terribly faithful to the manga, these dark-edged magical adventures are definitely worth watching.",1311292800,,4412,5.236543909348442

As stated above, I generally find most ""reversioning"" comes out worse than the original. This is one of the few I sort of liked though. It does violate a lot of the basics set up in the first series and (worse to my mind) changes some of the personalities of the characters to some degree, lesser or greater. In this case it was done well enough to make a new story that stands up well, if not as good as the first series. Still worth buying and I don't regret having done so.",1284249600,,625,4.305084745762712
3619737,4,B001GT9DR0,"Negima!? is the second series loosely based off of Ken Akamatsu's manga of the same name (thought without the question mark). This series is a complete reboot, beginning anew and taking the plot in a totally different direction than the first anime.

This time it's brought to us from the fine people at Studio Shaft, makers of such anime as Pani Poni Dash, Maria Holic and Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei. As any viewer of these series can tell you, they have a very distinct animation style which often features stylistic changes during specific events which could be anything from a color change to complete transformation of the drawing style. This may annoy some viewers, but fans of the studio would be disappointed without it (I know I sure would).

I won't go into much of the details on the plot, as it has already been well described by another reviewer, but I will say that the series is very funny, enjoyable and at times rather clever. Having never read the manga, but knowing that many details were changed, I can not say whether this is due to Ken Akamatsu or the studio. Probably a combination of the two.

The high point for me though is actually the ending theme song. I've honestly put on the DVD just to listen to it again and it's interesting to compare the different versions (each closing credits is sung by a different group of students).

So in closing, fun show, delightful ending theme... though I would suggest avoiding the dub.",1269820800,,1448,4.666666666666667

While dealing with weird problems in his class (ghosts, camping trips, Library Island), supernatural goings-on plague Mahora -- and the school is shifted into a series of surreal other worlds, where ""Dark Seeds"" attack on a regular basis. The Star Crystal is being awakened by a sinister force, and Negi may be the only one who can stop it.

For the record, ""Negima!?"" isn't very faithful to Ken Akamatsu's original manga -- the first few episodes loosely follow one of his storylines, before spinning off in a totally different direction with the whole Star Crystal storyline. It's basically split down the middle between fantastical goings-on and slapsticky comedy -- transformations, spells, enslavement, vampires, aerial battles and chupacabras. Well, sort of.

Fortunately ""Negima!?"" never feels overstuffed, even though there's plenty going on here on many levels (personal, magical, and Pactiowise), although a few feel like they were made just to fill a quota (the giant Evangeline episode). It's full of spectacular magical battles (ice tsunami!), goofy comedy (Setsuna skids right into a dish cupboard), and the occasional bit of romantic entanglement. But we never quite forget that there's something malevolent is approaching -- and the ending is nothing short of brilliant.

And the animation deserves a special shout-out -- the entire series is soaked in dark jewel tones and swirling magical spells, with erupting jungles of ice and hedgey mazes where evil creatures lurk. Mahora is a shadowy, vaguely gothic place with lots of dim streets and a city filled with starlike lights.

Negi proves to be a likable little hero -- earnest, courageous, unselfish and a bit tightly wound, while Asuna proves to be stubborn, brash, eccentric and sometimes quite ditzy (chupacabras!). There's also a wide cast of likable supporting characters, including the sweet Konoka, hard-nosed Setsuna, the serene ninja Kaede, bookish Nodoka, and the tragic child-vampire Evangeline (whose sad, lonely history is briefly explored).

""Negima!?"" is a stunningly animated revamp Negi Springfield's adventures -- and while not terribly faithful to the manga, these dark-edged magical adventures are definitely worth watching.",1261094400,,3366,5.447216890595009
3619739,5,B001GT9DR0,This season was great. It contained more action and a better plot line than its counterpart. It was funnier and a lot more fast paced. Overall I think it's a great addition to any Negima lovers collection.,1245715200,,205,4.5675675675675675
3619740,1,B001GT9DR0,"The original Negima series, while not particularly outstanding, had many touching and enjoyable moments. With this series, the assemblers (you can't call them creators) have decided to travel the same path, but in dung-covered boots. If your IQ has dropped 50 points since you saw the first series, you might enjoy this rehashing with additional screeching and irrelevant digression and repetition.

As one by no means exceptional example, compare the handling of Sayo the Ghost in the first and second series. In the first series, the diligent work of the class reporter Kazumi uncovers a typically Japanese story of sacrifice and love, leading to the class being able to see and include Sayo in their activities. In the second series, the reporter behaves ridiculously, sort of like an US Weekly boor, and no background story ever emerges.

At one point, a character in one episode says ""I don't know what this episode is about"". How true! And I don't know why anyone would have spent the money to package this tiresome drivel when so many better series, like the second season of Moonlight Mile, are waiting to be brought to North America.

You don't have to waste your money like I did.",1240876800,,1190,4.881188118811881
3619741,4,B001GT9DR0,"This anime is a new series - different from the previous ""Negima!"" series that ran. You can call this series a ""reboot"" of either the previous anime or the manga due to the vastly different storyline. Also different is the animation and art of the series.

Possible sticking points for some people may be the accelerated nature of the plot (the Evangeline arc is over very quickly in this series), the lack of certain trademark Negima plot points (particularly Asuna, who no longer has those mysterious qualities that she possesses in the manga), and the decision by Funimation to do the openeing and closing songs in English (while not bad by any means, some would undoubtedly still prefer to have the original Japanese versions).

However, I would like to say that this anime should be taken for its own merits. It is an anime that does not take itself too seriously, making this series fun to watch even in some of the more dramatic moments. The style is a refreshing interpretation of the orignal material's art style that utilizes rather dynamic coloring, making the bright moments more vivid and the darker moments more dramatic.

Ultimately, it may be far from the greatest anime ever seen, but it is definitely a very likeable one.",1238976000,,1239,4.807511737089202
3619742,3,B001GT9DR0,"I liked the animation style better than the first show, and I don't mind the faster pace of this new one. The art and story are closre to the books than the other, but the grafitti in the back round confusing and distracting.",1238803200,,225,4.255813953488372
3619743,4,B001GT9DR0,"Well, a lot of people critisised the first anime about it's crappy animation and bland artwork.  The exact opposite of that is displayed in Negima!? though.  Negima!? is packed full of vibrant colors, and precise animation.  The artwork is spectacular, and the humor is absolutely spectacular.

Then there's the plot.  It's a but hard to follow every place this anime jumps to, and trust me, it jumps around ALOT.  You can randomly go from a class to some weird place in the middle of England, where you see a bunch of characters that don't make any sense at all.  I suppose this is the biggest fault to the anime.

Also, they added 2 new characters, which I thought were absolutely adorable.  A little cat thing, and a frog, both of whom are mean, stuck up, and strict.  They follow Negi around trying to get him to spill the beans of his magic to anybody he can so that he'll be turned into a Chupacabra.

Most of the humor is during the Chupacabra club lessons taught by Asuna, who is absolutely obsessed with them.  She buys hundreds of shirts which she finds out later she doesn't need, and tries to get anybody she sees to buy one.

Unlike the first one, this anime doesn't really follow the manga at all.  What people should understand though, is that if it did, we would have just had an amped up version of the first one.

One more thing I feel like I should add is that they totally switched around the style of Nodoka's hair.  Not sure why, but everytime I see Nodoka on this I feel like shouting ""Use a cob, stupid!"".

Overall, I give Negima **** out of five, one missing due to the crappiness of the plot.",1233360000,,1618,4.393939393939394
3619744,5,B001GT9DR0,"I bought this anime with a few fears in mind but I have to say it is simply amazing. The Show is ridiculously well animated, it has great humor that isn't forced to vulgarity or sex to make it funny, a deep story line, and unlike a lot of animes everything meshes together very well. The plot starts out similar to the original before bending off into its own little story (and for some reason skips to year 3 after the 3rd episode) and like an above review mentions it does seem to assume you know a lot of things about the series. As I've mentioned before the plot is simply amazing all the characters are really fleshed out and seem so much deeper then they were in the original with a lot of things going on but they all work together very well but now I'm just rambling I guess the bottom line is if you were a fan of the original DEFINITELY buy this.

One more thing DOES ANYONE KNOW WHEN THE SECOND PART COMES OUT THE CLIFF HANGAR AT THE END IS DRIVING ME NUTS.",1230595200,,968,4.148936170212766
3619745,5,B001GT9DR0,"First of all, I love the Negima manga series.  The U.S. release is now up to volume 20 and it has been a fantastic ride the whole way through.  The first anime series was ok.  For the most part it followed the stories laid out in the first few volumes of the manga pretty accurately.  Then for the final few episodes they created original material to wrap up the series.  Overall, it was fun to see a great manga series in animated form with voices and music, but they really only scratched the surface.

This second Negima anime series starts over and pretty much tells its own story.  Some might complain because they want to see the Manga better represented, but I see no need for this.  I can enjoy the anime series as an alternate storyline, and this one is just all around fun.  The animation is fantastic and the characters are well represented.  Since it's a new story I get the same sense of wondering what will happen next that I do when reading the manga.

One bit of advice.  Going into this series it would help to be familiar either with the manga or the first anime, because this series spends a lot less time explaining things.  I would probably be confused if I had just jumped into this series without my previous knowledge of the Negima universe.  The creators really seem to assume the viewer already knows thw who's and the what's of it all.  So it's not truly a sequel because it starts over, but it's not completely independent from previous versions either.

I look forward to the next DVD release continuing this series, as well as the hopeful eventual release of the live action Negima series.",1230508800,,1619,4.493150684931507
3619746,3,B001GT9DR0,"I own the original anime, as well as part one of Negima?!. It does not bother me that the new series is not even as faithful as the first series (and that one was only partially faithful)although that is what it was originally supposed to be (according to advance press releases). What bothers me is that the producers took a great story (the original manga!) and dumbed it down to a child's level. I would let a 6 to 12-year-old kid watch this, but I honestly would not recommend it for an adult, unless you like light comedy, and only virginal interaction between the characters. For adults and older teens, stick with the manga and the first anime.",1230422400,,651,4.52542372881356
3619748,5,B001GT9DR0,"Negima!? is pretty much a brand new anime, but includes the same characters as Negima! (Note: Negima! is Season 1, Negima!? is known as Season 2, though they are entirely different)

Season 1 was based on the manga, where Negi needs to teach at an all girls school to complete his magic training. The whole series seemed to rely on fan service to me, but was also quite funny.

However, this version of Negima is nothing like the manga (after the first 3 episodes). This series relies on complete randomness to be funny. If you don't like randomness, stay away! There is pretty much no fan service in this season, making it much more family friendly and fun, though there is still plenty of romance (including a girl girl one).
There is a story, but its confusing and seems to only be brung up when the writer couldn't think of something random to add.

The characters mostly have the same personalities and traits as the manga/Season 1, though Asuna isn't as smart and has become obsessed with Chupacabras and is often portrayed as being an idiot.

Overall, I loved this season much more than Season 1.
(Though this is just the first part of the Season. I don't know what the last reviewer was complaining about pricewise, its the same price as other anime part 1 sets such as Ouran High School and School Rumble)",1230336000,,1314,4.578723404255319
3619749,4,B001GT9DR0,"Technically, there's already been an anime series -- ""Negima"" -- about preteen wizard/schoolteacher Negi Springfield.

But apparently that isn't stopping them from creating another parallel series, rebooting and revamping Ken Akamatsu's bestselling manga into the visually lush, fantastical ""Negima!?"" (see, the question and exclaimation mark mean it's a different show!). And this series is a vastly different creation -- while it's rarely faithful to the original manga's storylines, it's still a solid fantasy story sprinkled with some fun comic relief. And chupacabras.

Negi has been assigned to a vast all-girls Mahora Academy in Japan -- but things start going wrong before he even starts. Half-asleep student Asuna witnesses a small magical display, and a vampire is attacking students. A vampire who is also his student.

Even worse, the vampire Evangeline and her robotic partner Chachamaru are targeting Negi, since the boy is her only ticket out of a curse that binds her to Mahora. Even worse, her suppressed superpowers come back at the full moon -- and soon Negi's only hope of defeating Evangeline is by forming a Pactio (a magical contract). Asuna is the logical choice since she already knows about his magic, but will the stubborn girl agree before Evangeline's icy magic smashes Mahora?

But there's more trouble when a pair of disguised wizards bring news -- the legendary Star Crystal has been stolen, and it may be related to odd happenings at Mahora. As Negi tries to avoid erminehood, he must deal with a kindly resident ghost, the dangerous Library Island, camping trips with his Pactio partners, and an evil fairy that is attacking the school -- and even transports them to another dimension. Can Negi keep his class safe from whatever has stolen the Star Crystal -- and avoid being turned into an animal?

For the record, ""Negima!?"" isn't very faithful to Ken Akamatsu's original manga -- the first few episodes loosely follow one of his storylines, before spinning off in a totally different direction with the whole Star Crystal storyline. And rather than use the comedy and romantic woes, the first thirteen episodes choose to focus on all the magic that can be crammed into thirteen episodes -- transformations, spells, enslavement, vampires, aerial battles and chupacabras. Well, sort of.

Fortunately ""Negima!?"" never feels overstuffed, even though there's plenty going on here on many levels (personal, magical, and Pactiowise). The various subplots mesh together very smoothly right up to the cliffhanger, and the writers patch in stretches of quiet time where the characters talk, plot and occasionally go to class. And of course, we get some  spectacular magical battles and creepy magical creatures, with one highlight being the flashback of Negi's father battling Evangeline in a ruined city.

And though the focus is on magic and action, there's still plenty of comic relief -- chupacabra clubs, meatball-shapoed spies, goofy Pactio transformations, and a hilarious scene where Negi tries fruitlessly to erase Asuna's memory. His life becomes entertainingly chaotic as more and more girls learn of his magic powers, and he's forced to make more and more Pactios.

Even if ""Negima!?"" had a really rotten storyline, it would be worth watching for the simply stunning animation. The entire series is soaked in dark jewel tones and swirling magical spells, with erupting jungles of ice and hedgey mazes where evil creatures lurk. Mahora is a shadowy, vaguely gothic place with lots of dim streets and a city filled with starlike lights. And the level of detail can be breathtaking -- while casting one elaborate spell, Asuna can be seen clearly reflected in Negi's glasses.

Negi proves to be a likable little hero -- earnest, courageous, unselfish and a bit tightly wound, while Asuna proves to be stubborn, brash, eccentric and almost superhumanly strong. And though there's a vast cast, they all get a measure of fleshing out -- Konoka and her hard-nosed bodyguard Setsuna, serene ninja Kaede, bookish Nodoka, and even a ghostly student who's still hanging around. The best is undoubtedly Evangeline -- especially since the writers pause to reveal what a tragic, lonely life she has.

""Negima!?"" is a stunningly animated revamp Negi Springfield's adventures -- and while not terribly faithful to the manga, these dark-edged magical adventures are definitely worth watching.",1224115200,,4413,5.236543909348442
