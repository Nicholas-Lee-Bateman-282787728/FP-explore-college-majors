Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. Whereas Hera Pheri relied on some very humorous situation comedy; Phir Hera Pheri was a slapstick comedy. Very different from the original and not nearly as funny. I think I might have cracked a smile a few times but that was it.

I hear Akshay Kumar was involved in the editing of this film which doesn't surprise me; he clearly has more scenes than Suniel or Paresh. I wouldn't be surprised if some of Suniel's and Paresh's best moments ended up on the cutting room floor.

Hopefully the sequel returns to the humor I enjoyed in the original.",1179792000,,713,4.642857142857143
