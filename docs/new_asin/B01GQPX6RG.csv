8763323,3,B01GQPX6RG,Wasn't sure about Jillian Michaels. She's okay. I have watched the dvd's but haven't used them for workouts yet. Maybe down the road.,1506729600,,133,4.826086956521739
8763324,2,B01GQPX6RG,"So far I've only done the am workout with the 7day Shred video, so I can only rate that one for now.  The AM workout is tough, I loved the challenging moves of strength training.  However, the pm workout is not that great.  The assistants in her video are not coordinated and seem to not have done the excersises before taping.  It looks silly, so I think I'll stick with running for my cardio and only to the am/strength training part of the video.  More importantly this video was suppose to come with a 7 day meal plan.  Well, when I typed in the URL, that is noted on the video under ""Meal Plan"", It says, ""Page Not Found"". So when I go directly to Jillian Michaels website and click on the Meal Plan tab, you have to purchase the meal plan via a subscription.  This seems like a bait and switch.  I'm disappointed with the misleading advertisement.",1501113600,3,853,4.3544303797468356
