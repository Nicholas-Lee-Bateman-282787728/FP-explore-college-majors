4111924,5,B003DLTBWG,"Three-disc set includes ""Mist: The Tale of a Sheepdog Puppy,"" ""Mist: Sheepdog Tales: The Round Up,"" and ""Mist: Sheepdog Tales: The Great Challenge.""

Mist is (of course) a sheepdog puppy who grows up in the first film, learning the rules of being a good sheepdog. She exemplifies the power of focus, courage, and attention, and gently teaches those lessons. Added to this is a setting that will calm your spirit with beautiful photography (set on the coast of Devon, England?).",1281312000,9,477,4.9625

8394830,5,B003DLTBWG,I purchased this movie for my 3 grandkids for Christmas. They have watched it so many times I'm surprised it still works.,1357776000,,121,4.545454545454546
8394831,5,B003DLTBWG,"What can I say? I've purchased all the mist DVD's that I can find.  Such innocence, wonder, beauty, kindness and patience and the love of a shephard for his sheepdogs and sheep................fantastic!!!",1357776000,,204,5.375
8394832,5,B003DLTBWG,"3 DVD set, several episodes about sheepdogs and sheep on an English farm.  My girls love these!  I highly recommend them.  The set was shipped quickly and in good condition.",1356652800,,173,4.7
8394833,5,B003DLTBWG,"Our children love this series. Uncle Jake alone (voiced by British comic Paul Litchfield)is worth the price of these films. The voices match the dog's personalities perfectly - very expressive. It's not saccharinly sweet. The under current of adult references keeps it fresh. We enjoyed the others in the series and recently purchased them for our godchildren.

I found the camera work to be sketchier in the first film (""Tale of a Sheepdog Puppy""), but I believe that was for affect, viewing the world from the dog's perspective. This wasn't so with the later films.
Our children range in age from 1-7 years old. The littlest ones like the ""cuteness"" of the animals, while our 7 year old is picking up on the humor. Great for all ages. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.",1343952000,,771,4.753731343283582
8394834,5,B003DLTBWG,"I am NOT a fan of talking animal films as a general rule, but the beautiful scenery, good natured dialogue, and vivid characters of this series got past all my barriers and left me totally charmed.  I highly recommend the episodes in the three-disk set.  I just ordered two additional singles to relax with at the end of a busy day.  Animal lovers of all ages should enjoy these simple stories of sheepdog life on a very rustic farm.  Be prepared to find yourself within a smiling glow that lasts.",1334275200,,497,4.488888888888889
8394835,5,B003DLTBWG,"This was one of my daughter's favorite movies when she was 5.  We rented it from Red Box until they took it out of circulation.  When we learned there were sequels to the original we got them all.  The stories are well told and have delightful real animal characters (that speak through the magic of voice overs).  There is drama and action as Mist encounters other animals that are gruff, elderly, stupid, mean spirited (all the characteristics we humans can take on).  Mist is an inspiring heroine as she is plucky and willing to take on a challenge and persevere.  Mist role models behavior that you wish more humans would take on. This movie is a nice clean family film and would be best enjoyed by the 10 and under set...of course dog lovers of any age would also enjoy the films.",1332979200,,785,4.492957746478873
8394836,5,B003DLTBWG,These dvds are very appropriate for children.  My 7 year old niece who loves dogs just can't stop watching them!  Gather the family around and make the popcorn!,1320969600,,160,4.678571428571429
8394837,4,B003DLTBWG,"dvd's were in great condition. great price. my 5 year old daughter LOVES these dvds. we had rented mist from video store. it became a obsession for her. it was so exciting to find out there were more stories. now she has the original movie she fell and love with, plus many more stories! and yes, i like them too. particularly jake and mcpherson the ram:)",1303084800,,355,4.393939393939394
8394838,4,B003DLTBWG,"First DVD was our favorite - 2nd one cute too - but 3rd "" can live without"". Our family has always been a shetland sheepdog ""owner and lover"" - now our sheltie is our first bi-black - which is why Mist the puppie border collie sheepdog brought major smiles to all of our faces. Truth - even tho children can be safe watching these DVD's - only the ""older"" children in our family and our own ""age"" friends enjoyed much more. Not a major $$$ loss when you buy this 3DVD value pack. IMHO - better than spend more $$$ on three seperate ones. Was boxed and shipped safe!",1288483200,2,565,4.192660550458716
