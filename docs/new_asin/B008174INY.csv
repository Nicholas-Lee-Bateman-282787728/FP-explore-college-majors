I say that in spite of a very decent performance by Sharman Joshi as the ever-sincere doting single father, and Boman Irani as the grumpy, TV-glued grandpa, complete with white beard and glasses!

Actually, I have never seen a story where every bit of emotion is so forced and magnified you actually don't feel anything but annoyed. Giant close ups of events that are meant to make you feel moved, such as the boy falling over during a game of cricket, in seemingly very slow speed camera, cued with sad piano. This sort of thing happens again and again and again during the film until you feel like smashing a piano to bits with a cricket bat.

Every bit of humour is forced and feels so cued that you don't feel like laughing. Most Hindi movies are invigorating, but this one is so bland. Hard to rate it very highly.

There are some good scenes with bit-part actors such as the bumbling car attendants and the scoundrel who is a Politicians son, but the overbearing emotional magnification weighs the whole thing down.

The father and grandfather keep talking about going to London with a big tear gently squeezing out the corner of their eye that the viewer ends up hoping he doesn't go, only to see the film's ending, an oh so slow-speed shot of thousands of people cheering the boy as he walks onto the cricket pitch, trying desperately to drum up the emotion, but failing. I don't think it could even rate two stars.",1358208000,,1541,4.508960573476703
