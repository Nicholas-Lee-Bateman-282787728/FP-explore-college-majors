5391671,5,B00A705BKC,"This story, one must be warned, is a bit spicy.  Most Korean dramas the kiss is @ the end & is very chaste.  This drama has an actual sexual encounter, though tastefully done, it could be a shock if you didn't know it was there.  I thought it was really interesting as there wasn't a clear cut answer to who ends up w/ who.",1364688000,,323,4.015625

5391681,3,B00A705BKC,"Could have been a great movie.  I don't know if it was the terrible subbing or bad editing, but it did not flow well and parts were really confusing.  I love Shin Min Ah and Ju Ji Hun and would watch them in anything anyway.",1409702400,,224,3.9555555555555557
5391682,4,B00A705BKC,"Light drama with good acting. Not too deep but not shallow either, entertaining.
Strange title and some (very few) odd subtitles but it didn't take away from the film.",1408579200,,167,4.793103448275862
5391683,3,B00A705BKC,"In THE NAKED KITCHEN, director Jeong-hoon Kim takes the conventional triangle of a wife, her husband, and the wife's lover and spins a tale that begins logically but unfortunately ends illogically. The wife Ahn Mo-rae (Min-a Shin) has been happily married for one year to Han Sang-in (Tae-woo Kim). She runs a parasol store and he quits a lucrative job to fulfill a life's dream--to become a chef. To help him obtain chef experience, Han Sang-in asks a twenty-three year old French-trained Korean chef Park Du-re (Ji-hun Ju) for help. Quite by accident Mo-literally bumps into Du-re while both are hiding in a crawl space. Within moments their clothes are disappearing and the affair begins. Given that Mo-rae was supposed to be happy in her marriage it is a stretch to think that she could so easily begin an affair with a handsome stranger who coincidentally enough happens to be her husband's partner as a chef.

Since Du-re is staying as a house guest with Mo-rae and Sang-in, it is inevitable that the husband learns of the affair. Sang-in vacillates between accepting/forgetting the affair and getting jealous enough to brawl with Du-re. The middle part of the film is an odd dance between Du-re continuously attempting to repeat the affair and Mo-rae leading on then rejecting him. Finally reality intrudes when Mo-rae announces her pregnancy. The last few scenes do not flow logically or thoughtfully from the precedent action. One would think that when faced with choosing a comfortable conventional marriage to the predictable Sang-in or a passionate if unpredictable marriage to the youthfully exuberant Du-re, Mo-rae would choose one or the other. One would further think that the question of the baby's paternity would be settled. One, however, would be unfortunately wrong. The closing scene leaves both troubling issues unresolved. Further, Mo-rae's confession about her infidelity to her husband does not ring true since a guilty conscience is rarely the cause of such an admission. Ultimately, THE NAKED KITCHEN had the potential to unveil some human frailties but the unwieldy ending fizzled away any such hope. Not recommended.",1407628800,5,2146,5.148997134670487
5391684,4,B00A705BKC,The movie over all was ok. I think it could of had more romance. Who was the fathers baby. It could of been either of the guys. The ending was strange.,1400284800,,151,3.903225806451613
5391685,4,B00A705BKC,Good movie but I didn't really like the ending. I really wished it was longer. Also the title of the movie was like wha?!?!,1372204800,,123,4.166666666666667
5391686,4,B00A705BKC,"Absolutely adored the visuals of this film, wardrobe, interior, color correction, camera shots and all. I also loved the soundtrack, which matched the movie quite well. But the film disappointed in outlining its most important component which is the storyline. I enjoyed the mellowness and the style of this project; but the plot altogether didn't click for me, and probably didn't for many others. All in all, this is an enjoyable film to watch during a lazy summer afternoon.",1368230400,2,477,5.050632911392405

8547549,4,B00A705BKC,"This follows the formulaic modern charmer in South Korean rom-coms, and this is a good thing here; sometimes it is a little too over the top with feigned innocence and frailty in this form of TV show. I could watch Shin Mi-na in anything from My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, to not too well rated police dramas, Korean ideas of a rom-com and best of all ""The Magistrate and the Ghost"", loosely translated title on my part. Love. She is a talented actress and able to take on any role and add her own special charm. Watch The Naked Kitchen. You will have fun.",1479168000,,553,4.326923076923077
