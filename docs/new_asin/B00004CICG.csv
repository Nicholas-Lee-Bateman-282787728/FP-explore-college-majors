1338982,3,B00004CICG,"`Born of Fire' is an obscure, surreal film from '83 starring Peter Firth (Equus). Based on Arabian Mythology, the tale delicately unfolds of a young man who travels to the Middle East in search of the mystical Master Flautist bent on destroying the world through sound.

This film is definitely not geared to the general audience. It's extremely slow and the storyline is ill-defined and difficult to follow. However if you give it a chance you'll discover it has a unique, melodic feel all its own that will draw the attentive viewer into it's mystical world and leave its audience a lingering memory of mood and texture if not understanding.

My Rating: -3  Stars-.",1208822400,8,667,4.833333333333333
7919788,4,B00004CICG,"Few movies are unpredictable but this is one that manages to pull that off a few times. It's an interesting movie where bits of Luis Bunuel, Sufi mysticism, and Hammer Horror films complete with heaving bosoms ripping their way out of various articles of clothing combine to create a film that feels like a vague religious tract while also feeling like a horror film. Needless to say that it gets more than a little haphazard.

The basic story is about a flutist who has to figure out why he's being haunted. It leads to him meeting a love interest and them meeting a guy with some severe birth defects in a cave in Turkey who leads them to a Sufi guru that explains parts of the movie. Only barely though, you get a little about the Islamic tradition of how Satan became Satan and a little about where Djinn came from but mostly he just demands the guy play his flute. None of the above is boring though cause it's peppered with lots of extremely surreal and uncomfortable dream sequences that eventually bleed into reality.

It's an interesting movie from a form of Islam that's slowly dying as the fundamentalist reformation takes places within that religion. The ISIS and Sharia law types out there were probably angry about the music and twirling dervish stuff long before the nudity and magic took place. If anything, it's a fantastic cultural artifact and it's really nice that Mondo brought this out. They did a great job on the DVD. Worth buying if you can find a copy.",1467590400,,1478,4.59469696969697
7919789,4,B00004CICG,"Different, unusual but quite gripping. Has the much underrated Suzan Crowley in a major role.
However it was probably a flop at the cinema though maybe because it is unlikely it was shown often.
Cannot suggest you add to your collection unless you are looking for something different",1447632000,,283,4.916666666666667
7919790,4,B00004CICG,"I don't think most people reviewing this understand that Born of Fire (1987) should not be attributed to Islamic Horror. Yes, there's shots of some of the Sun symbolism footage but it was not even close to being Horror. Director Jamil Dehlavi is responsible for this aspiring feature. It would have been just as interesting as a mystical documentary.

Born of Fire (1983) is pushed as being an ""Islamic horror movie"" but it has nothing to do with horror. Far from it, it's more of an opaque, religious/surrealist art film. What it is, is a metaphorical journey that examines the duality of good and evil in man.

A Flautist (Peter Firth) is having dreams of the end of the earth, he meets up with a bewildering astronomer (Suzan Crowley) who predicts the eruption of fire that will destroy the earth.

The locations in Turkey resemble some far away planet, complete with odd caves and strange mountains formed by wind and water. There's not much dialog, which helps tremendously in the amorphous and obscure details.

The Master Musician fills in as a tempter or crudely, a ""devil"", who lives in a fire cave underground. Nabil Shaban as The Silent One is an interesting character, as he is deformed but kind at heart.

The scenes have a strange artistic merit, especially to note is a skull transposed over a bleak moon. The film is along the lines of Alejandro Jodorowsky (The Holy Mountain (1973), El topo (1970)), Andrzej Zulawski (Na srebrnym globie (1988) On the Silver Globe (USA)) and Federico Fellini (Satyricon (1969)).

I didn't like the quotes from the Koran towards the end, as they diminish the enigmatical nature and reduce the ending to religious determinism. Other than that this is a unique and beautiful film.",1384819200,3,1727,4.83728813559322
7919791,2,B00004CICG,"Billed as an Islamic horror film this work is very slow, bland and hard to sit through. There is little in the way of story, plot or dialogue. Nothing is really explained. It is not classified as horror now for good reason. It's almost like a video from the international tourist bureau. It's an art film but not a movie. Imagine vast stretches of time where we see no people and hear no dialogue. This was one of those movies I had to read the box cover a few times to understand anything. Amazon rates it 3.5 stars but I doubt the other reviewers like horror movies.",1378425600,,568,4.317757009345795
7919792,3,B00004CICG,"A little confusing.  But, the end wasn't too bad.  The case was a little beat up from the mail.  But, still watchable.",1367020800,,118,4.2727272727272725
7919793,3,B00004CICG,I love the actor Peter Firth and have watched many movies and shows that he has been in. I was very disappointed with this movie and ask myself why Peter would pick such a movie to be in. It doesn't have a story and frankly is pretty weird.,1334534400,,240,4.020833333333333
7919794,4,B00004CICG,"Badly written, but the writing isn't the point. Born of Fire, a feast of inspired, striking imagery and ideas, isn't quite like anything I've ever seen before, although it's somewhat reminiscent of the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky. Some of the reviewers here say they wouldn't classify this film as horror, but it does sustain an eerie atmosphere, and there are moments when it comes off almost like a surreal Islamic version of The Exorcist. The Turkish locations are amazing and otherworldly, and, combined with the director's eye for visuals, go a long way toward establishing the oneiric feel of this remarkable film. Director Jamil Dehlavi succeeds in creating a unique world, which is no small accomplishment. I see that Born of Fire only rates 5.1 out of a possible ten stars on IMDb, which is disgusting. It's sad how many people are blind to visual poetry and incapable of engaging with a film that isn't plot-driven.

Mondo Macabro's DVD transfer of the movie looks fantastic, and the interviews with Dehlavi, and actors Peter Firth and Nabil Shaban are all worth your time. Highly recommended.",1277164800,2,1105,5.005434782608695
7919795,5,B00004CICG,"I don't see this film so much as horror but as Sufi fairy tale... the Rumi quote at the beginning of the film really sets the tone for theme of the film. Yes, the symbolism (if you want to call it that) is hard to follow, and really, the only way to understand the film is not to take everything literally. I don't know what else I can say about this film, it's very surreal and gorgeous and sensuous and mystical and fiery, all at the same time.",1267488000,2,446,4.079545454545454

7919797,4,B00004CICG,"Yes, you read correctly. This is, to my knowledge, the only Islamic Horror movie. Now, Muslim nations such as Pakistan, Turkey, etc. have produced plenty of horror movies. But this is the only one that presents the genre of horror from truly Islamic mindset. All the others were copies of Western / Christian based horror.

In a nutshell, a concert flautist and his astronomer girlfriend go to rural Turkey to investigate a solar disturbance that threatens the earth. While there, the flautist is taken under the wing by a Sufi (Islamic mystic) who helps prepare him to battle a powerful djinn (demonic spirit) - and they do battle using nothing but music as their weapons.

The film has a few flaws, and the symbolism will be a bit confusing to some who are unfamiliar with the base material. But all is all, its a good film; and if nothing else, it holds its own as a unique piece of cinema.",1249948800,10,893,4.575
