8707384,5,B00UM7FWQ8,"Never thought that I would enjoy mysteries that force you to read the English subtitles.

8707390,1,B00UM7FWQ8,"Stunningly, stultifyingly boring with the worst pacing of any drama or it's genre.
On the plus side I did manage to catch some quality napping.
To be fair it appears to be my own damned fault for buying season 3, after watching the first and second seasons.
BORING! Sloppy acting. Poor direction. Scenery IS lovely, BUT that is nature not the producers fault.",1445212800,,359,4.714285714285714
