6426915,5,B00KH67BBI,GREAT ON TIME DELIVER,1408320000,,21,4.5
6426916,5,B00KH67BBI,"Since ""Sahara"" in 1943, which had Humphrey Bogart commanding an M3 Grant, this is the only movie until ""Fury"" that is built around an Army tank, a late-model Sherman in both cases.  I have seen this many times in the last 40 years, and for me it stands the test of time. The script is a little predictable when it comes to characters, but much of the action is unique.  Where has there ever been a duel between mortars in a movie?  Where have they stopped a truck convoy without shooting, so that the gasoline could be drained from the tanks?  The Chinese soldiers try to escape after killing the mortar team, and the British tank driver crushes the killer in a truck, driving the Sherman over it.
 At the end, they hold the hilltop with both air support from F-80 Shooting Star jets and then naval gunfire from an Iowa-class battleship firing 15 miles inland with instructions relayed by radio. The cast is superb, with many people who went on to movie fame or TV series- Richard Conte, Peggie Castle, Charles Bronson, L. Q. Jones and Chuck Connors. The mortar man nicknamed 'Strangler' is Aaron Spelling, who holds the record as the most prolific television writer and producer in US television history, with 218 producer and executive producer credits.  Abel Fernandez played Pvt. Geronimo; four years later he was Federal Agent William ""Bill"" Youngfellow on the 1959-1963 ABC Television series The Untouchables. They are not in the main credits, but are listed in the full cast at IMDB.
As you can see, I like this movie, and I am so glad they made a DVD for it.",1465171200,,1566,4.615107913669065

6426920,2,B00KH67BBI,"I lived thru the Korean War era, and have watched a number of movies on the subject. This one falls way short of ones like ""Retreat Hell"", for one example. All too predictable and cliched. Take a cue from the cast...these are nothing more than ""second bananas"".",1451779200,,261,4.574468085106383
6426921,4,B00KH67BBI,"Good movie with a good cast.  Aaron Spelling had a cameo as one of the ""Plumbers"".  I always had a thing for Peggie Castle when I was younger, even though she only played in ""B"" movies.",1444089600,2,185,4.111111111111111

6426928,5,B00KH67BBI,I saw this movie when it first came out and remember the kids cheering on the USA soldiers fighting in a last ditch effort.  It's well worth watching again!,1429401600,,156,4.379310344827586

6426931,4,B00KH67BBI,"The hills below are swarming with red Chinese while a harried mortar and tank crew attempts to hold them off as saber jets fly overhead In Target Zero. This Korean war-era film would have gone almost unnoticed back in the day, but for today's viewer it is a delicious war epic (on a budget admittedly but one that pays off in many ways). while Charles Bronson is not in as large a role as you are used to he's still present with a wide range of fellow actors of the day who performed very well enunciate clearly and or a gift to watch. The first two thirds of the film involve getting a tank to a remote hilltop held by the allies, and if it gets a little talkie it is at least punctuated by good action scenes. But once on the hill this film, made at Fort Carson Colorado, involves lots of extras and a heckuva good time.",1425859200,5,822,4.176100628930818
6426932,5,B00KH67BBI,I've been looking for this movie for a long long time. I joined the Marines after Wachting the moving.,1424822400,3,102,4.421052631578948

6426934,5,B00KH67BBI,"DVD arrived in timely fashion, etc. from Amazon. Never a complaint from me.
 Now this film is a really good story about the Korean War, filmed on location ( no, not IN Korea, but OUTSIDE, not in a studio all the time.) during some live fire training in 1954-55. Equipment and tactics are correct for the era. Well, one glitch in the gear is that the British tankers ( that's the UN international forces cooperating part of the story) are in a Sherman tank. An American Sherman, but one with what looks like a 90mm gun tube. Their outfit was badly mauled, so ""Yank equipment"" was issued according to the tank commander. Anyhow, a bunch of American GIs on patrol have discovered the ""Reds"" have made a push and they are now behind enemy lines as they hook up to the lone tank in the same situation. The tank in turn has picked up a babe who was working for a UN medical team that was cut off too. She is our female romantic interest. The GIs also learn that their whole unit was overrun and destroyed. Their ""Lt"" decides they must still push on to get back to the hill that was site of their company's last stand. ( Yes, so they can make a stand too...for the ""lost guys of Easy Company"" - hey, it always seems to be Easy Company when the situation is less than easy...script lovers must have love that line..) So the GIs, Lady, and Tank team up and do just that. Along the way is some pretty good action...not always predictable. The actors are Warner Brothers contract players of the 50s ( some soon to become stars in their own right) like L.Q.Jones, Chuck Conners, and Charles Bronson. And some who did not, but are famillar faces to the other baby boomer watchers out here. The star is Richard Conte, a hollywood star of the 40s whose star was a little tarnished with time and age, but still a known Hollywood name in the screen credits...don't fret that he's kinda old to be a first lieutenant in the Infantry...it's only a movie....with some great scenes of jets attacking ground targets, and so on...if only it had been color...but B&W is just as cool! The conclusion is predictable....we know who will get the girl...but you have to see the movie to watch the U.S. Navy save the ground forces collective butts!!!",1419465600,11,2219,4.452088452088452

8658754,3,B00KH67BBI,"Amazon's service and the quality of the video rate five stars, but the movie itself, only three (maybe two). This picture is basically 'Sahara' set in the Korean war, only this time the British have the tank, an M4A1E8, which itself offers a flawless performance. The fun is seeing Charles Bronson, Chuck Conners and others in earlier roles. Less than fun is the story line, which of course includes a rather unconvincing romance between a US civilian woman and the star of the flick (no, not the tank, the Lieutenant). Technically, it's fun to watch the air attack, but the tank crew is somewhat inept in that the loader takes his time replenishing the main gun and for some odd reason, both the gunner and bow machine gunner forget that they have automatic weapons at their disposal as well. Out of ammo? Unimaginative TC commands? Who knows. There's plenty of time to go to the bathroom or get a snack during the more mundane scenes in this movie. So, if you want a rather silly old war flick, put on one US boot and one English, lace them up and take a seat. IF you didn't like 'Battle of the Bulge' absurd story line, you won't like 'Target Zero'.",1484438400,,1152,4.516746411483253
