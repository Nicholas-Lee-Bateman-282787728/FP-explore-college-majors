8424542,4,B004CZZZ86,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was a teenager in the early 80's. I remember watching it on the late night tv movie. Man was I so pissed at Lorenzo Lamas' character in this film! I was so glad that his character got killed in the end. OJ Simpson's murdered ex-wife is in this film as well and wasn't credited. She's a passinger on the bus and had no speaking part, she was just an extra.  Watching this film, brought back some great memories for me. It's not a bad film, it's definately dated but well worth watching.",1425945600,,518,4.232323232323233
8424543,4,B004CZZZ86,"That's really all you can say about this movie. The acting, the plot, and the dialogue are all such low quality that you sit mesmerized that the someone or better yets someones agreed to pay for this movie to be made and I thank them for their horrible business acumen. My family had a blast pointing out all the cheesy lines and obsurd twists in the storyline. The first review sums it best. A great way to while away a couple of hours.",1389484800,,437,4.27710843373494

8424545,2,B004CZZZ86,"Detour to Terror (Michael O'Herlihy, 1980)

The stupid seventies disaster movie lives on thanks to the wide, wide range of cable channels to be found in even the most basic package these days. This particular piece of silliness is only notable for the presence of O. J. Simpson in a lead role, back towards the beginning of his acting career. As one might expect from the presence of Mr. Simpson, this movie is blissfully awful, but it's awful in a fun, cheesy sort of way.

The plot: three guys hijack a tour bus from Albuquerque, NM, to Las Vegas. Lee (Simpson), the bus driver, rallies the tourists and attempts to stand up to the hijackers.

As is usual with this kind of flick-- especially in its made-for-TV incarnation-- what you will likely wind up doing while watching this dog is thinking about how much more interesting it could have been had the screenwriter actually decided to take any of the obvious detours he could have taken with the plot. (I kept thinking that it would have been really cool had one of the passengers also been planning on hijacking the bus for some other reason.) But, like the majority of seventies made-for-TV disaster flicks, it's stupidly watchable, and you can while away an easy hour and a half if you happen to be lying around the house laid up with an injury or something. It's bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment, but it does what bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment is supposed to do-- entertain. Not one to go out of your way to hunt down, though. **",1359244800,,1496,4.724137931034483
