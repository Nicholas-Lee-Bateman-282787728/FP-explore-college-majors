2270745,5,B00097DXTO,"""Ronin Gai,"" is an excellent film. Set in 1836, the film follows the story of four ronin who have been stripped of their titles. Ronin, who are masterless samurai, became more commonplace in Japan when their services were no longer needed; especially as Japan had become united under the Tokugawa Shogunate; and therefore with warfare behind them there was little else for them to do; other than to sell there services to whomever required it. Yet, for many, there was no work period. With many clans no longer employing their samurai, and letting them go out on their own, many samurai, [soon to be ronin] became poor and cynical. The Bushido code was what the samurai aspired to, yet this did not put food on the table, or clothes on their families backs.

In the absence of strife, which would employ the ronin, the film opens showing the main characters who have fallen on hard times. There is 'Bull Akaushi (the late Katsu Shintaro, of 'Zatoichi' fame), Gennai Aramaki (Yoshio Harada), Horo (Renji Ishibashi) and Oshin (Kanako Higushi). When these four ronin are hired as thugs, bouncers, or anything to make a living to support their drinking, they fall into despair. As one of the reviewers wrote in his title, 'The Seven Samurai meet the Iceman Cometh.' As a result of having a lower status in society now, these ronin no longer look up to, or abide by the Bushido code: As they now must do whatever is necessary in order to survive. The consumption of large amounts of sake to help drown out their problems, while keeping the company of prostitutes, helps them to alleviate their misery.

The first 2/3 of the film basically deals with the brothel, and life of the ronin and Geisha's who are part of the established area that these ronin have now grown accustomed to, while the latter 1/3 of the film deals with more action. However, the character development and plots narrative follow a very good storyline in dealing with the two worlds of these ronin and the Geishas. However, something happens which will give meaning to these ronin. In the film, someone is murdering prostitutes in the nearby forest. The geishas ask the ronin for help in protecting them. Finally, there is a second chance for these ronin who have forgotten their code and dignity. The film, directed by Kazuo Kuroki, is an excellent morality tale of how these four ronin try and regain that lost honor, which they once lived by: Master or no master. The film is highly recommended, and belongs in your cinema collection.",1167609600,4,2503,4.751724137931035
2270746,5,B00097DXTO,"For a comprehensive and excellent review, see Kim Anehall's comments. A tiny bone to pick, however, is the assessment of the close of the opening duel, when the bystander rushes to the fallen duelist and exchanges swords with the slain man. After he absconds with his prize, it becomes clear that the sword he has left with the corpse is bamboo ( another character breaks it in outrage). This indicates the extreme poverty of the thief, since he has clearly been forced by circumstance to sell his sword and has carried a bamboo sword to conceal this disgrace . A similar circumstance occurs in the more recent ""Twilight Samurai"" when the viewer is told that Sanada Hiroyuki's character  had to sell his sword to bury his wife.

  The final battle contains some of the best swordplay ever filmed; and oh, that Katsu Shintaro, perhaps his most poignantly heroic scene ever!",1163894400,10,872,4.793333333333333
2270747,5,B00097DXTO,"I personally really enjoyed this movie.  Reminded me a lot of the old Toshiro Mifune films back when he worked with Akira Kurosawa.  As what the Amazon describtion said, it has aspects of Unforgiven, but it is wrong because Unforgiven was written way before this movie came out... unless this movie was written way before that one then I am wrong.  But nonetheless it is a good movie, it had laughs and action and drama and all the stuff that makes a movie good.",1154736000,8,462,4.476190476190476
2270748,5,B00097DXTO,"Excellent drama about down and out, displaced ronin (masterless Samurai) wasting away in a dive bar/brothel, drowning their sorrows in sake. Fate intervenes to give them one last shot at redemption and ""saving face.""

As the Amazon reviewer notes, it bears a passing resemblance to Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. Eastwood is an acknowledged Japanese film fan, so perhaps this is no accident.

In any event, it is an inspiring story for us middle-aged folk whose lives did not turn out the way we planned, but find solace in the Yogi Berra aphorism, ""It ain't over till it's over.""

2270749,5,B00097DXTO,"The setting, a poor area outside of Edo, a rundown restaurant and small time brothel.  Prostitues, drunken ronin and unemployeed samurai work, sleep and drink, spending most of their time trying to forget the past or plotting to enrich their future.  This film has been made with loving care and unmatched knowledge of the film craft that it is hard to put down how good it is, even with a thousand words.  It is gritty, touching, rude, lovely and ugly all at the same time.  Shintaro Katsu, not to be confused with Toshiro Mifune, plays Bull and really gives the character heart and soul.

2270750,3,B00097DXTO,"With a storyline that has so much promise, and as a tribute to the father of its genre (chambera/jidai-geki), I found this version of Ronin Gai to be both weak and disappointing. The editing and camera-work were dull, close ups that were cried out for failed to materialize, the incidental music was irrelevent, and characterizations while promising, never attained their potential.",1129680000,7,382,5.278688524590164
2270751,4,B00097DXTO,"It is typical of the Samurai or Chambarra style films; there is an enemy and of course this enemy is the dreaded state itself.  I bought this movie because of Katsu Shintaro, who does a great job as always.  This film is not about excessive fight scenes, in fact you have to wait until the end to see the spectacular fight (very gory), which includes some awesome iaido.  It wasn't my favorite Samurai film, but it certainly has an intriguing plot involving passion, lust, honor, and blood.  From what I understand this movie is a remake, I haven't seen the other film so I can't compare them.  This movie kept me awake, at even 11pm, which says alot. It has an engaging, yet predictable plotline.  I found myself very attached to the turmoil of the geisha in the film, and I felt even sympathy for the ronins.  If you want a beautiful film concerning Ronin protecting geisha you will find this in the film.  In some respects a very similar structure to a Zatoichi film, but more in depth.",1124236800,9,989,4.4860335195530725
2270752,3,B00097DXTO,"Good, but not great, really. If you're expecting this film to be full of action you'll be disapointed. Nice to have if you're a Shintaro Katsu fan and love period films.",1123459200,5,169,4.483870967741935
2270753,5,B00097DXTO,"Ronin Gai tells a story of four different ronins in 1836 that have no solid existence in life, as they have been stripped of titles, income, or meaning.  Their introduction into society's poor quickly bestows them a cynical perspective of life.  This place had no room for their high morals, Bushido, as it does not put food on the table, or provides a roof over their head.  If the ronins were to live by their high ideals in their newly assigned social class it would offer them nothing but belittling and public ridicule.  Thus, these bewildered and socially perplexed men of Bushido found themselves taking derogatory odd jobs to pay for the sake in which they could drown their misery and problems.

To fully understand Ronin Gai some historical, political, and cultural perspectives can help the audience through this remarkable cinematic journey.  In the 1830s the samurai purpose slowly faded away amidst a peaceful time after centuries of cruel and bloody clan wars.  Yet, the clan society still existed in a feudal system run by the Shogun who demands the clan's support, or they had to face war.  However, the wars have drained the lands and people's will to fight, which has given peace a chance to root.  This meant that there was a surplus of samurai, which often lead the samurai to become masterless either through the death of their master or more likely because the master could not afford them.  These samurai became known as ronin, the master-less samurai, who drifted aimlessly trying to find a purpose and hopeful meal ticket.

The samurai code, Bushido, originated from Buddhism, Confucianism, Shintoism, and Zen.  Through Buddhism the samurai gained the insight that death was not to fear, because death lead to incarnation and possibly another life as a samurai.  The unyielding loyalty of a samurai was derived from Shintoism while Confucianism gave them their principles of  human relations.  Zen gave the Samurai the knowledge of focus and meditation, which should help a samurai to learn one self and avoid personal limitations.  In addition, the samurai were to be righteous, compassionate, loving, and most of all have complete self-control.  Combined with all these values Bushido ascends the samurai to be a true and complete warrior.  However, the Bushido followed the same diminishing fate as the samurai where ronin had to find an existence among those that did not live or could afford to live by the Bushido.

Ronin Gai opens with a spectacular scene where rain washes away the dirt around a tree exposing its roots.  This rain provide multiple symbolical  interpretations suggesting that the samurai true nature is about to reveal itself and cleanse the blood from centuries clan wars.  Of course additional interpretations are available, as the scene quickly jumps into a duel where to ronin is about to fight to the death while the rain drenches both men.  After the duel, one of the story's main character advances to pray for the fallen ronin, but also takes advantage of the situation and exchanges his sword.  This further displays the disillusionment of humanity among the masterless samurai, as the sword was something samurai would guard with their lives.

In the absence of war life is flourishing in the little village outside Edo where the story takes place.  The main characters have fallen below in social status, to many thugs and thieves, as they struggle for the little income they can acquire.  These four ronin find themselves as hired thugs, bouncers, bird salesmen, and even taking advantage of women's generosity.  In this society very little has changed for the women, as they still face chauvinism and inferior positions in regards to the men.  The women are used to their low social standing while the masterless samurai display depression, confusion, and disregard of the Bushido code to be placed in such a low standard.  They escape their miseries through large quantities of sake and the company of prostitutes in the local restaurants and brothels.

The brothel plays an significant part where the geishas appear far stronger than the samurai.  When someone begins to ruthlessly kill innocent geishas for sport in the surrounding forest the geishas request the help of the ronin.  A chance for salvation arises for the masterless samurai who are sluggish in their attempts to prevent further killings, but eventually they come around to try to regain what they once lost.  It is evident that Bushido is about so much more than mere sword fighting, as these men have been stripped of what they once held in high regards - their morals, beliefs, and identity.

Kazuo Kuroki directs a stunningly beautiful tale of the masterless samurai and their lost Bushido.  The framing of the film displays several symbolical scenes and notions to ponder that go far beyond the script.  It is truly a pleasure watching this film, as characters and actions come together in a final conclusive decision supporting what they all believe.  Ronin Gai is a graceful film of self-worth that reaches beyond the cultural boundaries and leaves the audience to ponder several interesting ideas and beliefs.",1120003200,75,5149,5.021201413427562

8058390,3,B00097DXTO,"This is really another 2.5 star review, but leaning towards the two star scheme of things.

I saw bits and pieces of the big samurai fight on YouTube, and that's what sold me on buying a copy of the DVD.  But there's hardly anything in the way of sword play in this film until the very end.  And that's a downer.

Like a lot of Japanese films there's a very fine gloss and just overall high production values for the genre.  I'm always jealous that the Japanese are (usually) able to put together great films when it comes to the samurai genre.  I've never seen a bad one.  Some scifi, specifically the kaiju/monster genre, can be corny or hokey, or just plain laughable.  Even the detective or spy films from Japan can be a little off.  But the samurai genre endures.  It's like it's almost sacred.

As such a lot of the film is exceptionally well staged.  It's just that the story isn't very inspiring, and the film itself just drags.  We see the plight of the female characters, and the villainy of the elite Shogun retainers, and it's like one understands that there's a story here, but there isn't much exploration as to why that story comes around in the first place.

And the characters, as is typical with a lot of Japanese cinema, even the very well executed films, are a bit over the top.  There's a strong tone of seriousness that is very much offset by the character performances who are well composed one moment, then let loose with rage or some over the top performance in another.

That, and there's only one sword fight, and that's at the end.  So, as the film moves, we discover what's being done, who is doing it, and we get a sense of why, but we don't get the whole story of why there's an ongoing tragedy.  So the story lakes bit of motivation in the psychology department.  In this way the film is almost a throwback to a Japanese version of Beowulf; i.e. there's a fight, and the ""hero[s]"" have to deal with it at the end.  But, again like Beowulf, we're not really given a satisfying reason why this is all happening.  There's hints, some statements, expressions of dissatisfaction and what not, but nothing really concrete where we can say to ourselves that we get it.  It just is.

I guess the best way to sum it up is that this film is a well staged photoplay of a pretty thin story that has lots of attention paid to the victims and their protectors.  But there's nothing much beyond that.  We're not allowed into the heads of the bad guys, or not too much anyway.  And again, that's the real downer or let down.

Beyond that, it's an interesting film to see maybe once, but if you want a samurai action flick, then I'd recommend you look elsewhere.",1495065600,,2677,4.410204081632653

8058395,4,B00097DXTO,"RONIN GAI (1990) or ""Streets of the Masterless Samurai"" is an award-winning remake to Masahiro Makino's original. Directed by Kazuo Kuroki (Tomorrow), the film also commemorates the 60th death anniversary of Shozo Makino; dubbed the father of Japanese cinema. Shozo Makino is the one individual who revolutionized Japanese cinema by incorporating Western style and sidestepping the usual limitations of ""plays"" in cinema. This is also Shintaro Katsu's last role as the Ronin named Yagoemon ""Bull"" Akaushi. Shintaro Katsu is renowned for his roles as ""Zatoichi"".

Synopsis partially derived from dvd cover:
Set in the 1830's near the end of the age of the samurai, a small town is populated by an ensemble of colorful characters, social outcasts who patronize a restaurant and brothel on the outskirts of Edo. Among them are prostitutes and masterless samurai reduced to drunkenness and debauchery. The disgraced and disillusioned warriors get a chance at redemption when rogue samurai invade the area to murder the prostitutes.

We are all used to the usual Chambara films about the samurai code of honor, loyalty and duty. ""Ronin Gai"" takes a different approach; it is a Jidai Geki period piece that portrays the samurai legend in a very human and compromised level. Much like Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" with ronins finding redemption and Yamada's more recent trilogy who explores the thought of a petty samurai; this film goes the whole yards to portray samurai with an almost nihilistic tone of eccentric behavior. These men are commoners, in the lowest level of the social class, definitely not heroic. Ronin Gai (this film and the original) definitely changes the face of Chambara films forever.

These Ronin make their living in any ways possible. Gennai Aramaki (Yoshio Harada) is a drunk who depends on Oshin (refreshingly beautiful Kanako Higuchi), a prostitute in order to eat and drink. Horo makes his by testing swords for wealthy samurai by decapitating corpses. ""Bull"" (Shintaro Katsu) is one very interesting character; he serves as a bouncer and would go as far as letting the prostitutes' johns to hit him on his head in exchange for a meager amount of money. Bull shows a sensitive side as he also teaches the prostitutes to read and write. Obun's brother is a disgraced samurai who peddles birds to make a living. This may be a problem for the film, as these factors may form an unlikable trait from the audience. The film puts its focus on a small restaurant that is the home for prostitutes. In turn. It effectively portrays the effect of the decline of the feuding warlords that made the samurai obsolete and the dawn of the merchant class.

The film is quite visceral in its execution of swordplay. The direction by Kazuo captures the essence of samurai films in the early years. The swordfight near the end has the blood-splattering effect that we have all been used to. This more modern version may differ from Makino's original script but still retains the strong nihilistic and eccentric attitude established by Masahiro. The performances by the cast are actually quite excellent. If the director's goal is to annoy the viewer with the display of eccentric behavior, then it has been achieved. However, there is a balance to this factor as represented by the very sympathetic characteristics of Oshin, Tahei and Obun. You just can't help but be mesmerized by Kanako Higuchi's beautiful face and very conscientious character as the Oshin. Tahei (Michitaro Mizushima) is the tavern owner who also serves as the conscience and warden of the film's backdrop. Obun (Kauru Sugita)represents the status of a woman during that period, daughters of poor samurai could only hope to attain a better social status if they marry into a wealthy family.

I cannot go to any more detail without spoiling the film. Despite its cast of insufferable characters, I found that ""Ronin Gai"" to be a powerful piece of Japanese cinema. In its final reel, all the pitiful ronin who exhibit lecherous behavior, do ironically do rise up to serve honor and justice; becoming TRUE Samurai. Kazuo captures the essence of the heroism inherent in the most pitiful individuals in this manner. It also further cements the (counter) cultural traditions of the Jidai Geki that has been established by Masahiro Makino that was first brought to worldwide acclaim by Akira Kurosawa when he directed ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Yojimbo"".

Highly Recommended! [4 stars]",1206748800,,4453,5.068212824010914

In 1990, the film that may have gone a long way towards reviving the Samurai film in Japan was Ronin Gai.  Ronin Gai featured a solid cast that included Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi) in his last role.  The film was fairly well written and directed, and had some fine performances from the cast.  The mood that director Kazuo Kuroki created is almost perfect for the film.  The sets and atmosphere created give the film a genuine period look (unlike some of the lesser Samurai movies), and the cinematography is quite good.

But what holds the film back from being in the top tier of Samurai films that are named above is the script.  It's not bad at all, but lacks a solid central hero.  The drunked ronin who is played up as a potential hero has to be bribed to attempt to save the day.  The more honorable ronin who is in love with the female lead is reluctant to stand up for himself (until the end), and Shintaro Katsu's character is a tough guy without any confidence in his abilities, so he relies on his wits to resolve situations.  The screenwriters make it difficult to get behind any of these characters and root for them (again, until the very end, and even that isn't handled as well as it could have been).

The other issue (and it has been mentioned before) is the action/swordfighting in the movie.  The word used was, ""Sloppy,"" and that is true.  It stretches believability to think that the drunken ronin while falling down, slipping, tripping, and flailing away can successfully take on as many samurai as he does in the final sequence.  While Kurosawa's influence on this film is clear, what it lacks is the disciplined, well prepared and choreographed swordfights that most of the best samurai movies have.  None of these actors appear as athletic or coordinated as Toshiro Mifune or Tatsuya Nakadai, but that could have been minimized with greater preparation for the swordfight scenes.

Even with all that said, however, Ronin Gai is a good movie.  VERY good in spots, which earns it my 4 star rating.  Shintaro Katsu gives a remarkable performance, and the rest of the cast is good at worst, and very good at best.  As noted before, the mood created by director Kuroki created was very good and fits the story perfectly, so there are many, many positives to point to when discussing Ronin Gai.

Ultimately, while not the best film to introduce a samurai movie neophyte to, it is a movie that converted fans of the genre should watch at least once",1205280000,3,4141,7.05078125

The ending, where his character redeems himself, gave me a satisfying albeit somewhat sad feeling.  The movie itself was powerful, and the women's roles were ably portrayed and completely believable.  Whether you are a Shintaro Katsu fan or just a fan of the genre, in general, I do not believe this movie will disappoint.",1182124800,2,691,4.982608695652174
8058398,5,B00097DXTO,"""Ronin Gai"" is almost a metaphor for the entire Samurai genre.  Bereft of meaning, no longer following a cause, once powerful figures struggle to keep their dignity, or else they surrender to their despair and try to forget their faded glory in drink and easy pleasures.  Comparisons are often made between this film and ""Unforgiven"", as both are transition films that bridge a maturing genre from something that has become a parody of itself into something that can still have a powerful message.

It features the final starring role of the legend Katsu Shintaro. Once famous for his role as the powerful and charming sword fighter Zatoichi, Katsu in his middle age had become a bloated pleasure seeker, and is hardly recognizable under the layers of fat and handsome face ruined by hard drinking.  In perfect casting, Katsu plays the warrior Bull, a pathetic figure who earns money for his liquor by working as a bouncer for a local brothel.  His story is entangled with three other former samurai, Magohachiro, who sells birds for a living and is attempting to regain his position with a local lord, Gennai Aramaki, a powerful warrior who lives for nothing but alchohol and women, but holds the heart of a beautiful prostitute, and Gonbei Tanomo, the only one who reserves a vestige of dignity in his faded state.

The four are brought together when a overzealous band of retainers of the Shogun begin murdering prostitutes, considering them a taint on the honor of the samurai tradition.  Because of their status, they are untouchable by the local authorities, but for former samurai with nothing to lose find that they are not so far gone as to stand up for the lowly who cannot protect themselves.

The story of ""Ronin Gai"" is very dark, and deals with heavier themes than are usually found in the genre.  It still retains the pacing of classic chambara, with a long slow build up to an explosive finish.  The action and sword fighting are excellent, showing that even someone as weathered by life as Katsu Shintaro can still stand tall in the saddle when the old passion strikes.",1173052800,7,2086,4.801675977653631
