3118184,5,B0013N02YM,I loved the dvd as it was all about an amazing journey that started in Jerusalem about 600 bc and ended in Central America.  Scholars have taken the evidence in the Book of Mormon in the first book of 1st Nephi and traced the words in the book and put this with the geography of the placed they covered -- it is only an educated guess but it was a powerful yet thoughtful theory of their Journey and truly it was one of Faith as that would be the only thing that got them from Point A to Point B.,1373760000,3,496,3.96

3118188,5,B0013N02YM,"This video traces the route of Lehi's family from Jerusalem, across the desert, and into the land of Bountiful. It shows you where ancient relics are today that Lehi's family may have come across. You will also see where scholars think the Land of Bountiful is located today, and what materials Nephi used to construct the ship that they used to cross the ocean. You will also learn the significance of the name ""Nahom."" This video should be required viewing for all Latter-Day Saints! This video should be followed up by Part II, which is Journey of Faith: The New World.",1231027200,13,572,4.673267326732673

8252270,3,B0013N02YM,"This movie was good, with with lots of commentary by experts,  but it's a bit out of date now. As a follower of Old World Book of Mormon research,  I much preferred the 2015  released Lehi In Arabia : The Search for Nephi's Bountiful DVD released late 2015 which has more current information and actually features Warren Aston, the independent LDS researcher who personally identified the most likely Bountiful site of Khor Kharfot",1452556800,,431,4.876712328767123

8252274,5,B0013N02YM,"I wanted to see actual footage of the frankincense trail for a book I've been researching for a decade, and this video did not disappoint. I was elated to hear the various experts and scriptural professors and *see* the landscape and archeological ruins. Even though I've traveled through Jordan personally, I was SO GLAD to discover this video, since traveling through Saudi Arabia and Jemen and Oman are much more difficult to do these days. My whole family loved this video, thank you for making it!",1399507200,3,502,4.848837209302325
