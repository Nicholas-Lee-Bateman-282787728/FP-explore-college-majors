5880048,5,B00DZ4925M,"Brilliant 2 Part  Episode One - very moving with subtle and nuanced acting from a strong cast.
Well worth watching.",1399766400,,115,4.75
5880049,4,B00DZ4925M,"This is a family story as much as a series of mysteries.  The characters are quite compelling.  The views of Trieste spectacular.  It will make you want to put Trieste on the itinerary of your next trip to Italy.  Worthwhile and enjoyable.  The photography is less than wonderful and the production values so-so, but the actors carry the enterprise and make me wish there were more to come.",1388448000,,390,4.676470588235294
5880050,4,B00DZ4925M,"It's different from the usual cop show. I like the father and son angle and that the son is gay (no spoiler here, it's part of the premise). In the first episode - the only one I've seen so far -  this is a source of conflict but they are both good people and as time goes on, I'm looking forward to them renewing their relationship on different and more mature terms.",1383868800,3,368,4.111111111111111
5880051,5,B00DZ4925M,"We have gotten hooked on Italian mystery series (Montalbano, Don Matteo, Inspector DeLuca, etc.) through watching the MHZ network. (Hooray for MHZ, the best network around these days!). We ordered the Inspector Vivaldi Mysteries because we had missed most of them when first aired on MHZ. We were NOT disappointed with this series, as the story lines, the writing, the acting, the scenery are all wonderful. Frederico Vivaldi is an ""aging"" police inspector in Trieste, so one learns a lot about northern Italy in this series. His son is also a policeman, and Vivaldi is separated from his wife of many years. We watch the relationships grow and change over the several episodes. In each episode there is a crime (usually murder) that must be solved, and at the same time there is a long-running mystery/crime that follows through all the episodes, only to be solved at the end of the series. English subtitles.",1382572800,5,910,4.915584415584416
5880052,4,B00DZ4925M,"I found this series to be pretty good.  It is not, in my opinion, in the same class as Montalbano.  The main character and the supporting actors are not as interesting or amusing. The setting of Trieste is nice, and those of us who love the Italian language are happy to have this choice.",1381708800,5,288,4.314814814814815
5880053,3,B00DZ4925M,"I was hoping for a bit more of a mystery.  The story line is more about the Inspector and his relationship with his son.  The price was ok, but the series is just..ok.",1380758400,13,167,4.03030303030303
5880054,1,B00DZ4925M,"This mystery series from Italy was a disappointment due to its lack of real mystery and detecting.  It instead packs its stories with plenty of soap-opera drama.  The lead detective Vivaldi is obnoxious with an overblown ego and self-centered style, who thinks his lame insensitive jokes are funny and those who think otherwise are just too sensitive.

I'm familiar with other mystery series from Italy and found them to be good to excellent, however this mystery series is not recommended for those looking for good stories with real mystery and detecting.",1380240000,18,557,5.0989010989010985
5880055,5,B00DZ4925M,"This is probably not the best of all the Italian mystery series, but it merits five stars anyway.  The scenic shots in every episode are nothing short of magnificent.  The plots are fine, the acting is fine.  The ""personal"" side is a bit soppy in parts, and the subtitling is sometimes sloppy.  (There are a few typos and ungrammatical sentences.  There is also this inexplicable translation of the hero cop's advice to his assistant:  ""We have to remain calm if we want to frame him."")  Still, these episodes are breathtaking -- and you won't regret this choice.",1377993600,20,563,4.742268041237113
8599415,4,B00DZ4925M,"Very enjoyable if you love detective series, as I do.  Maybe not to the level of Montalbano, but nevertheless, worth viewing.",1509667200,,125,4.9523809523809526
8599416,5,B00DZ4925M,"Apparently this video series has be around for some time, but that didn't take away anything from the enjoyment this brought. We loved it and wish there was more. The acting, the plots, the scenary, are outstanding. Even with Italian subtitles it was well worth it.",1488240000,,265,4.782608695652174
8599417,2,B00DZ4925M,"The two stars are: (1) because it is in Italian (if you are interested in learning the language), and (2) because you get a few good views of Trieste.

Apart from that, it is an eight-episode story about relationships.  The main character being a detective, there is a murder included in each episode, the kind that is easily solved (i.e. the kind that is not very interesting).  There is an additional plot, concerning an 18-year old unsolved murder, with a denouement that just does not hold together.  The authors should have made a list of who was where, when, and who was working for whom.  (I can't tell you more without saying too much.)

If you like soap operas, this is for you.  If you prefer detective stories, forget it:  this is trash.",1454198400,2,748,4.571428571428571
8599418,2,B00DZ4925M,Very stagey and not as interesting as the reviews here led me to believe.  Endless stupid behavior which seems out of character for anyone much less a policeman.  We will probably watch all of it eventually but the first few hours were very long and disappointing.,1429401600,,264,4.717391304347826
8599419,4,B00DZ4925M,"Most enjoyable, wish it continued like the Brunetti series.",1427328000,,59,5.666666666666667
8599420,3,B00DZ4925M,"This was a new one for me, a sappy, soap-operatic detective series. Scenery (Trieste) is fabulous and characters are good-looking but music is dreadfully repetitious and many story elements are just hard to believe. Good Italian practice though.",1423008000,4,245,5.473684210526316
8599421,4,B00DZ4925M,very enthralling in a pleseant way.  fun time of enjoyable diversion. well done,1422662400,,79,5.076923076923077
8599422,4,B00DZ4925M,"I have just finished watching the whole series. I am really touched and surprised it is as good as, if not, better than, any American detective series around that same period. Though I have to stagger in between the Italian language ,which sounds beautifully soothing, and the subtitles, I did not get upset a bit and was attracted by the episodes entirely. Another Classic catch of mine. Hahaha...",1420588800,,398,4.867647058823529
8599423,4,B00DZ4925M,"Subtitles well done.  Easy to follow the story lines with the acting and
translation. Maybe more hopefully down the road.",1404950400,,121,5.05
8599424,5,B00DZ4925M,Really good family story line as well as the mysteries involved.  Great acting of entire cast.  So much better than anything on American television.,1401667200,,148,5.125
