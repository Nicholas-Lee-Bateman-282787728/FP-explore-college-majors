5677684,5,B00BVF8PPU,"I agree with the previous review- in that I had the book and kind of went through it and got some good results.  However - these new videos set a new benchmark for Kenny I believe- Kenny has really done an incredible job at getting these concepts across.  There are a few new key ""phrases"" he uses that really helped me tremendously-.  I  felt like I really experienced ""The Space"" in a very real way because of this new video series- I had an incredible time on the gig that first night after purchasing this-even as a novice at this concept -I felt more relaxed on the gig immediately- and ; like Kenny says,  I want to make this my goal in all my practicing and performing- it is truly Nirvana when you experience this.

I highly highly recommend this new video series from Kenny Werner-  Kenny has highly refined this concept so that it is simply and easily obtainable for anyone- I believe!!",1363996800,5,896,4.426829268292683
5677685,5,B00BVF8PPU,"To me, it is one of the most uplifting experiences to listen to music, creating that state of fulfillment inside you - where you end up with just a happy  Ok. Thank you. No more questions!"" - concluding life is just beautiful.  While listening to a beautiful (Free) improvised piece on Kenny Werner`s first of two instructional DVD Melody, Harmony & Rhythm"" (jazzheaven.com) this is definently the case.
Just a few notes, and my a foggy day in Cologne town (sadly waiting for spring to come)"" agony turns into a positive hmm ... - what am I at least waiting for? Let`s get to work"" state of mind. Anyway, let`s stay reasonable, and wait for actual instructions to come.""

It`s a few minutes later that I can`t avoid getting seated at the piano telling myself yes yes ... I`ll keep watching ... but it will cause no harm to let my fingers explore the keyboard a little bit along with Kenny`s talking ... ."" A few minutes later, as Kenny starts explaining his string concept, I experience myself pressing the pause button, since I cannot resist playing any longer; suddenly I feel enabled to create some of the most beautiful lines I heard myself play ever, almost on the spot, after just a few minutes of practicing. Oh, did I say practicing? Wasn`t it more of just fooling around, enjoying myself and the instrument, achieving amazing results?

I wonder, if one could ever expect more from an instructional DVD?

Years ago, Kenny`s book  Effortless Mastery"" meant an awesome step forward to me already: eventually there was someone speaking out on issues such as passion, our personal shakiness, spirituality, or even worse"": music and Love.

Bringing in account the musician behind the musician, the book was a milesstone. It stands next to the groundbreaking works of Heinrich Jakoby, the sadly underated giant in the history of teaching music (at least his works are only available in his native german language - as far as I know).

By having Kenny Werner available at my living room, whenever and as long as I want, many of the issues both of them point out, become more tangible - and real (I highly recommend to by the DVD forever"" instead of going for a 24 h or 90 days account).

The teachings at least remind me of the time that I was fortunately part of Bob Brookmeyer`s composers class at the Hochschule fr Musik Kln in the mid 90`s. It`s the same mind changing quality, only going a step further by Effortless Mastery: The 4 Steps"", directly adressing our state of mind while practicing or performing.

I sometimes heard musicians criticize Kenny for claiming a kind of a Guruship. On both DVDs I never had the impression this is the case. What I experience is a musician sharing his excitement and passion for all aspects of music. I find the teachings pretty much down to earth, real life"" orientated, and probably enriching for any open minded person interested in improvisation.

8574497,5,B00BVF8PPU,"I've read his book in parts over the past few years. I've always struggled with what Kenny calls the 'ego' for sure. If I'm practicing, I want to get it now, and if I can't, my frustration takes over and before you know it the horn is back in the case. I've read tons of books and seen tons of videos on practicing and I am learning that all of them for me are pointless if I can't learn to get over this 'ego' that is holding me back. In Kenny's video, he elaborates on the different steps taken to acquire effortless mastery for any material. It all begins with the initial approach to the instrument. I've never thought of truly approaching holding my instrument from an effortless, almost ""guided"" view, but it is something that I have found is truly difficult to do in practice. When doing this and approaching making sounds on my instruments (woodwinds) I can do so without judgement, fear, anger, impatience, doubt, and all of the other negative emotions I have come to associate with playing and practicing (despite the fact I love music very much!)

It is in this conflict that I sought help from the DVD I'm reviewing, and I believe I have gained another tool for my toolbelt that will help me on my musical journey.

Good luck to you all!",1402790400,2,1249,4.449781659388647
8574498,5,B00BVF8PPU,"I've had Kenny's book ""Effortless Mastery"" for years and tried to implement his advice, but I'm still a self conscious amateur jazz player.  I have a bit of distance/lack of trust with my instruments (piano, trumpet, violin, sax) and this DVD really nails how to get in contact with your ax.  Gosh, it requires patience and trust.  Kenny said this in the book but seeing him and most importantly hearing him on the subject got me to the point of actually doing what he says. Bonus points for showing how the 4 steps work on specific instruments as it's not always intuitively obvious.",1402617600,2,584,4.650485436893204
8574499,5,B00BVF8PPU,"I'm a trumpet/piano player in the Aspen, CO area.  I have two Jazz Heaven videos, both by Kenny Werner.  I don't go very far from them... ever!  I had a private lesson from Kenny, and these videos feel very close to being in the room again with him.  Though I've practiced these principals for a few years, having read the venerable ""Effortless Mastery"" book, it always helps to watch Kenny's demonstration of each step.  They are well produced, and thoughtfully put together.  Highly recommended!",1402531200,2,497,4.857142857142857
8574500,5,B00BVF8PPU,"The 4 steps is an eye opening and exciting demonstration of the famous 4steps from Mr. Werners' epic ""Effortless Mastery""
As one who has struggled for nearly 40 years to find an effective method to bring about real change in my playing, I have benefited deeply from all of his matierial. In this dvd we see not only him demonstrate the 4 steps, but  watch him guide others thru the same steps,in his usual wise, compassionate and genuine manner.
With a great sense of humor he disarms the boogeymen of our malformed egos, namely impatience,narcisscisum and the self pity from being overwhelmed, and inspires all to connect with our instruments as instruments of pleasure, not torture.
It is highly unusual to have an artist of this high a stature share their gifts so freely and effectively. All his matierials are must haves.  Bill Kahl",1392940800,3,837,4.805555555555555
8574501,5,B00BVF8PPU,"If you ever were sitting on your instrument and thought about what you actually want and should practice on, then this workshop will help you to focus on the important things to work on.

Kenny brings great ideas how you can open up yourself to look at your instrument in a different way. Especially for all who have ""practice fatigue"" that is the DVD to get.",1388188800,2,359,4.4393939393939394
8574502,1,B00BVF8PPU,"online view, don't purchase. It is a major hassle to try and view the video online...hence it is a waste of money. The video freezes up a lot. I couldn't get half way through it without it stopping endlessly",1386633600,,207,4.333333333333333

8574504,5,B00BVF8PPU,"""If one withholds love and approval from oneself, then the piano is an unforgiving, complicated machine with too many choices and no owner's manual.""

Does this resonate with you? If you already know the book ""Effortless Mastery"" then you know that there is a way to transform yourself and your music by practising the 4 STEPS which Kenny Werner described so brilliantly in his book. Now being able to see him demonstrate the exercises himself and with students takes the impact of his teaching to an even higher level.

Here's my tip: save your money that you would spend on yet another theory book, artist transcription or peace of musical hardware and treat yourself to building a solid foundation which will allow you to bring out the master you really are no matter what you play.

This is not about jazz, this is about you - could there be anything more important than that?",1369180800,6,880,4.701298701298701
8574505,5,B00BVF8PPU,"If you read and enjoyed Effortless Mastery (The Book ), this DVD - The Four Steps- follows that very closely, but it goes beyond what the book can do in a few ways.

First of all, the video continues what Effortless Mastery aimed to do, by really demonstrating how to get into the space. I read his book, and I was profoundly moved by it, but because my mind was always super conscious of what I was playing, perhaps overly conscious, attempting to reshape the place I played from continues to be challenging. What I really love about this video is that he demonstrates how to get into the space, and although it's just a video, it is a much easier medium to actually apply such an abstract approach, at least for me watching him and trying out for myself than simply reading about it. For the first time, since discovering his amazing philosophy a few years ago, with this video, I was able to actually get into the space, not all the time, but for brief moments, but enough to really hear a difference.

I highly recommend this video. He is great at describing how to get into the space, and how stay in the space while practicing. He demonstrates this lots of different ways, and unlike the book, I could actually hear him speak to me in front of the piano on what to do, have a chance to do it, and see what it feels like for myself.

An incredibly unique look into one of the most overlooked areas of studying jazz, the place in which you play from, how to find that place, and how stay there.

I have lot's of jazz material, and if you are like me, may consider that you already have enough stuff. You still haven't learned Giant Steps in all 12 keys at 450 bpm, so why get more stuff to practice? Well, for me, it's about finding great insight into practicing this music, and this lesson is absolutely gold !",1365379200,7,1815,4.329411764705882
8574506,5,B00BVF8PPU,"Kenny Werner is unique, in my experience, in his ability to translate into succinct linear thinking what an artist  does automatically and spontaneously.

Other reviews have covered  most of the descriptive details, so I will focus on my perspective as an  artist to describe what makes Kenny Werner's work-including thIs wonderful DVD- unique and extremely necessary in the world of music pedagogy.

There are in my experience two general types of music professionals : The artists and the craftsmen.  The artist has mastered the craft aspect up to his present requirements to perform and compose. He/she continues to work all his/her life on  technical expansion to suit increasing musical mandates. The artist has realized that he/she is music and that  the personality is a filter that acts as a conduit for the music to manifest to the external world (the audience).

 The natural childhood ability to live as music, during music making must be there in the adult life or one cannot experience music fully. The pure craftsman cannot experience  music fully as a creative professional. There is something missing which needs this connection with one's inner being to appear.

The effective methods to reach this state of awareness and full experience of musical manifestation are at the core of Kenny Werner's work as a master teacher. However, a master teacher who improvises and plays an instrument can also teach practical physical technique at the highest level, so there is also  in the DVD fantastically effective ways to practice, as your favorite idols do.

Most importantly, getting into the state of pure inspiration is the crux of the matter, as physical technique is mastered. That is the difference between an artist who is also a brilliant technician that reaches and audience deeply compared to  a brilliant craftsman that makes a very impressive  but forgettable impression on the same audience. Kenny Werner shows what he and any other jazz great actually does and how to think and act like a great  artist.

Much of the current academic methodology is great, and quite necessary, mostly for basic, intermediate and advanced theoretical knowledge; yet, given it's post factual analytic stance, falls way short in explaining creative methods and technical conception used by actual improvising artists. These artistic methods actually transcend basic and even the most contemporary advanced academic  concepts and go beyond, much beyond.

I have  the privilege of working often  with some of the world's most prominent jazz artists, and one of my favorite things to do, before gigs or during rehearsal breaks, is to chat informally with them about what one does. I've verified that all, do the same things taught on Kenny Werner's book ""Effortless Mastery"" and on this DVD.

The reader would  be very surprised if I told you who among well know jazz masters  has read Kenny's book and learned from it. In fact two days ago I was stoked on the phone with a world renown bass player and after I told him about these new DVDs he got very excited and was ready to order it after his headlining concert at Blues Alley.

I would like to say that the contents are very easy to understand and very fun to work on..as music should be for all!",1364947200,5,3253,4.966728280961183
