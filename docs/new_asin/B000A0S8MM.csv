8071786,4,B000A0S8MM,"The typical Faustian scenario of making a deal with The Devil, then renigging on that agreement, trying to cheat one who was gracious enough to help the applicant in their heartfelt wish. There;s always some kind of 'battle for the soul' at the end, where the dealee somehow worm their way out of the contract. All the while The Devil is a perfect gentleman, & of course would become annoyed when a business transaction is unfulfilled. An amusing Judeo-Christian mythological frivolity to be sure.

Released for the Halloween season, the tale of this animation is based on the short story The Devil & Daniel Webster by Stephen Vincent Benet, with a film with the same name and premise, except the benefactor of the first part is a farmer fed up with the stresses of his occupation. Other more well-known storylines with this scenario include '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tenacious-D-in-The-Pick-of-Destiny/dp/B000MCH5RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny</a>', & the song 'The Devil Went Down To Georgia' by The Charlie Daniels Band;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Charlie-Daniels/dp/B00009PJSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Charlie Daniels</a>.

The animation herein The Devil & Daniel Mouse is reminiscent of Rankin/Bass productions, and works very well for a children's fable. The Devil is portrayed as a beastly, richly ample Lord of The Underworld, complete with pentagram necklace, while his primary henchman is a rather fox-like weasel.

The Devil comes to the aid of Jan Mouse, distraught over being fired from the nightclub which payed the bills for she and her counterpart Daniel Mouse, granting her dreams of being a singing rock superstar, for of course, the price of her ""soul"", which she signs for in blood, of course. Daniel Mouse is nowhere to be seen until the latter half of the film, for a confrontation in a hellish court. One good turn deserves another, so the veritable deception on the mice's part is met in kind.

If any ""morale"" should be extracted from it, it is to honor your promises and don't lie, in this case, a business partner, especially a successful one for great mutual benefit, which is ironically the misplaced trait attributed to The Prince of Darkness, who materialized all your desires. Have character and honor your agreements. ",1346284800,,2400,5.582417582417582

8071789,4,B000A0S8MM,"This festive animated entertainment from Nelvana captures the 70's very well, from the music styles (be they folk, funk, or Kiss glam-rock), the hairstyles (dig that beaver's cool afro!), to the fashions (shag, fringe, & bell bottoms!).

Unlike _some_ animation studios, Nelvana managed to actually have good songs & music tracks on the projects they cared about.  The animation on the Devil is amazing and is most likely by the same animators who animated Mok for Nelvana's later Rock & Rule.  I don't own this tape but I do own the 22-minute version on the Rock & Rule 2 disc Collector's edition, which leaves me wondering what 3 minutes was cut out from this 25 minute original. If someone knows, please fill me in.",1164672000,3,718,4.774193548387097
