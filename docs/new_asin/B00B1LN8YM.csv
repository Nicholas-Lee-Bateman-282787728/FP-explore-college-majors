8560893,2,B00B1LN8YM,"If you are just looking for a bunch of episodes of the Smurfs then there is no reason not to buy this set.  What I don't like is that is says ""The best of seasons 1 & 2"" on the cover.  That would suggest these were picked for being important or the most entertaining.  They aren't even randomly picked as when I opened the case I could tell these were just the first discs from other sets.  Disc one says ""The smurfs season one volume one disc one"" the second disc says ""The smurfs season one volume two disc one"" and the third disc says ""The smurfs a magical smurf adventure disc 1"". I looked at pictures of the other sets and the art on the discs matches those. So this is just a repackaging, not a best of collection. Maybe it really isn't a big deal and two stars is too harsh but it annoys me.

If you are curious about what episodes are on here they are.
1. The smurf's apprentice / the smurfette / vanity fare
2. King Smurf / the astrosmurf / Jokey's medicine
3. St. smurf and the dragon / sorcerer smurf
4. The smufs and the howlibird
5. The magic egg
6. Smurfette's dancing shoes
7. Supersmurf / the baby smurf
8. The fake smurf / paradise smurfed
9. Sir Hefy
10. The purple smurfs / haunted smurf
11. Sideshow smurfs
12. Smurf van Winkle
13. Revenge of the smurfs
14. Magic fountain
15. Smurf me no flowers
16. The cursed country.",1364515200,26,1340,4.178294573643411
