4992196,3,B006IXRKT2,"Monster brawl is what it's title states, an all out ""Monster Mash"" of the creepiest, most disgusting monsters on the planet. O.K., i know i sound like a member of the publicity team for this film, but you must take it for what it is. Monster Brawl is a fun romp, with cool monsters, great kill scenes and some pretty decent special effects. The Cemetery set is really atmospheric and the back stories of each monster lends some needed light to their mystique. I took a gamble and ordered this DVD sight unseen and I am very glad I did. This is one film i will watch every time a bunch of family and friends get together for a rowdy, good time. Is it a classic, not by any means. Is it fun, different and entertaining..YEP!

There really is nothing to review here. The movie is pretty much a back story of the two fighters and then the fight. Think ""Celebrety Deathmatch"" meets ""Bubba Ho-tep"". This is kind of entertaining and a little funny but really nothing more then watching ""Wrestlemania"" with horror monsters. Since that is all this is there is really nothing more to say and since there is no real substance it is hard to review.

4992211,2,B006IXRKT2,"The concept for this movie is a decent idea, take classic monster icons and invite them to go one on one in a wrestling ring. Sounds like a movie that could do well, right? Well, here's why it didn't.

The back story is some small town promoter who lives in his moms basement wasn't getting much attention with regular wrestling shows. So he invited a bunch of monsters and mythical creatures to face off in the ring. Set out in a graveyard somewhere, no live audience, just 2 commentators, a referee, a bunch of cameras operated by what seems like no one, and Jimmy Mouth of the South Hart with 2 chicks in bikini's playing himself (says alot already) and stupidly voiced over like Shao Khan of Mortal Kombat by Lance Hendrikson.

Then introduce the monsters, and their managers. Do a stupid small mini back-story of how the monsters came to the event, and place them in a boring match even for small time promotion events standards. Take note of the extra padded ring floor and wonder why it wasn't used to an advantage?

The contestants are
- Zombie Man (brilliantly named, ey?)
- Witch B*%# (even better)
- Cyclops (oh, an original name at last)
- Vampire Girl (are they even trying here?)
- Mummy (not THE, just Mummy)
- Wherewolf (you can do Zombie Man, but not Wolf Man?)
- Swamp Gut (The Swamp Thing too hard to announce?)
- Frankenstein. (Played by Robert Malliet, the pro wrestler Kurgan if you remember him in the WWF Attitude era)

Unfortunately Dracula, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, Micheal Myers and Leatherface where busy playing Russian Roulette at Ghostface's that night. The prank went so well that Hannibal Lector offered to clean up the remains when they where done playing their practical joke on Ghostface. A movie concept that would be more humours to watch than the lack of humor found in this movie that obviously was meant to be a serious horror, but the direction of the movie was being led so poorly, they tried to pass it off as a comedy that was not meant to be taken seriously. Yeah, SURE IT WASN'T :P

So a couple of rounds of one on one fights happen to the death, and some pretty predictable events occur. All based around the stale area and it's atmosphere that would have people demanding their PPV money back the moment the first match was over.

The make up effects are pretty bad too. Cyclops looks horrendous, not in a good way. Frankenstein looks more like a dead version of Doctor Emmet Brown, Witch B^%$ looks like a pilgrim from a Monty Python movie, and if you have a dwarf named Troll, make him look like one then, would that be so hard?

The basic structure is the movie kicks off like the opening of a PPV, but has little flash backs to how the monsters got to the event, with a stupid word or two voiced over by Lance Hendrikson... every one of them completely pointless.  There will be 5 matches, two for light weights, and two for heavyweights, which the winners of the heavy weights will face each other for the belt at the end.

The commentary has a couple of slight chuckle moments when they say things you won't hear on professional wrestling broadcasts, but apart from a bit of foul language, it's not enough to save them from being a poorly acted drunk commentating with a stupid wild west gunslinger of the past.

Some of the monsters have managers, as I said, a troll that looks like one as much as he can finely act. A descendent of Doctor Frankenstein whom which I am willing to bet the actor has never even seen a Frankenstein movie before, and Kevin Nash who is a military man who has been secretly trying to train a zombie to be a lean, mean, wrestling machine.

There was a couple of small chuckles here and there, so I won't give the movie 1 star... however the ending was predictable, yet, cut short of what you expected to see at the same time. So, no 3 stars or 2 and half, as I never want to watch this garbage ever again.

Gore fans will get nothing out of it. All the effects are low budget, and seen done better even in movies with a lower budget. They should take some lessons from Lloyd Koffman to find out how it's really done. The acting all around is horrible, and there is no way this will even become a cult favorite movie. Probably the biggest disappointment is the fact you have potential to do some movie work for a wrestling themed situation. They can call cut here, use wires, trampolines, whatever to invent some great effects to show these guys have some super human strength .. yet, all you get is some kicks and punches and an occasional choke slam. The rest is pretty much foam tombstones being whacked over their heads. How could they film this, like filming a live show, and expect that would be enough to make a wrestling movie about monsters with super natural abilities? You only see one effect from one of the monsters, and it's pretty disappointing.

See it only if you can't resist the urge to see how bad it is for yourself. But by god, don't purchase it, don't even pay to rent it. And go in with very low expectations, and you won't be overly disappointed when it ends... don't get me wrong, you'll be disappointed for sure, but not overly.",1384992000,,5143,4.4643237486687966
4992212,2,B006IXRKT2,"Some ideas are better left in the imagination and never brought to fruition.  This is most likely the case with the 2011 movie from writer/director Jesse T. Cook, MONSTER BRAWL.

The premise here is that the movie is a televised pay-per-view event pitting famous monsters in history against each other in a series of deathmatches until one ultimate victor emerges.  It sounds like a winning idea.  Until you see the finished product and realize that's 90 minutes you'll never get back.

The problem here is the question of story.  Sure, we've got a concept, and we've got decent effects, and even a couple of recognizable names and faces, but we have no plot, no journey from point A to point B, no character arcs, nothing.  We don't even have someone to root for because, with no story, there's no identifiable ""hero"".

The movie is treated, literally, like a standard pay-per-view event.  And, while the focus is on wrestling, which I haven't watched in 25 years, I watch a lot of boxing, and am familiar with the format.  Before each match, we get a minute or so clip of the fighters' backgrounds, then go to the tale of the tape before the match begins.  The fighters battle it out, one monster is killed, and it all starts over again.

Providing commentary are Buzz Chambers (Dave Foley, ""The Kids in the Hall"") and Sasquatch Sid Tucker (Art Hindle, PORKY'S).  And that's it.  There's your movie.

MONSTER BRAWL takes the viewer through five rounds, two in the middleweight division, then two in heavyweight, ending with the title match.  There are two conferences, monsters and undead.  In the first match, middleweight monsters, Cyclops fights a witch, then in middleweight undead it's the mummy against a vampiress.  Heavyweight monster sees the werewolf battle the swamp gut, and finally it's Frankenstein's monster vs. a zombie.

I loved the idea for this movie when I first heard it, and was looking forward to seeing what awesome movie could be made from such a concept.  Unfortunately, what resulted from such an idea was a waste of time.

What makes matches like this work is having someone to root for, whether a champion, an underdog, or in the case of a Mayweather fight you just want to watch someone wipe that smug look off his face.  But there's nothing like that here.  I thought we would at least have a story in the background, a character somewhere, a cameraman, a producer, someone with a stake in the outcome.  Maybe one of the managers is in deep with a bookie and needs his fighter to win.  At least there'd be some drama there.  Hell, I'd even take the standard group of college kids who decide to go see the Monster Brawl over spring break or something, and find themselves caught in the middle of an all-out monster war they have to survive, only to be picked off one by one until the lone survivor destroys all the monsters in the end.  That I would have enjoyed, as clich as it would have been.  Instead, we get nothing.  Absolutely nothing at all.

I wanted so badly to like this movie, but Cook didn't give me anything to be invested in.  After a while I just wanted them to get to the main event finally so it could be over and I could get on with my day.  That's not the sign of a good movie.  I wish I could recommend this one, but you'd be wasting your time.",1384214400,,3297,4.562180579216355
4992213,4,B006IXRKT2,"Its definitely a different monster movie that's around its filmed like a UFC/WrestleMania deathmatch type event ,that doesn't have a live audience, between horror monsters and creatures in a creepy abandoned graveyard. It does make a really good use of makeup effects with some use of CGI There is humor and satire in it but there needed to be more. It would have been better if there had been a live audience just so there wasn't any dead air during the fights. Because of that the fights are really quiet besides what the commentators say and the impacts from the blows. The movie would've been funnier with the inclusion of a live audience that got mauled by the fighters from a missed attack and just make the fights seem ""realistic"". This movie isn't for everyone its still an original idea that shouldn't be ignored for those that are huge fans of monsters or wrestling this a buy, but for everyone else I would recommend renting it or watching it on Netflix to see if you like it before buying.",1383350400,,1001,4.597765363128492

4992216,2,B006IXRKT2,"Coming at you live from atop the Hillside Necropolis arena it's MONSTER BRAWL, a fight to the finish featuring eight of the world's mightiest monsters who will face off in hand-to-hand combat to decide who is the baddest of them all! It's ""The Fight of the Living Dead!"" MONSTER BRAWL kicks off with all of the mayhem and madness of a major sporting event as set within the dark confines of a traditional Gothic Horror film, but what could have easily become an instant cult-classic has instead turned out to be a major disappointment for both Horror and wrestling fans alike. Writer/Director Jesse T. Cook simply isn't equipped with the proper skills or resources to pull this off, which is a real shame considering the film's potential. The basic plot and cliched characters are to be expected, but there is no excitement to be found in any of the fights, and even our ringside commentators Buzz Chambers (Dave Foley) and Sasquatch Sid Tucker (Art Hindle) appear to be feigning interest in the event. Cook provides a moody graveyard setting and serviceable make-up effects care of The Gore Brothers, however the only real praise belongs to the team at Phantom City Creative, who bring the look and feel of a major sporting event to life in their post-production title cards. Given the continued popularity of mixed martial arts and professional wrestling around the world, it is a surprise that this project was not picked up by a larger production company, who may have been able to transform MONSTER BRAWL into this decade's Celebrity Deathmatch.

4992217,1,B006IXRKT2,"Holy crap. Monster Brawl might make history as being the worst film ever made - period. The cringe-worthy factor is that someone out there really believed in this movie and clearly put forth an effort to make this thing a reality. This is obviously a low-budget pet-project, but even given this the film is just plain bad. Centered around a wrestling ring in the middle of a graveyard, historic monsters battle it out WWE style - complete with clotheslines, body-slams, and the since-forgotten smack talk in front of a green screen. Really? REALLY? Yes, believe it.
The ""story"" if you could call it that, drags on. Each story-arc follows the same basic premise: 1)Introduce the two monster fighters via a short origin story (probably the best part of the film) 2) Show some hokey graphic of their vital stats as explained by two ring announcers who have some of the worst written dialogue I've ever heard. 3)Have each creature slowly lumber into the ring and do their man-dance for the crowd that doesn't exist (never mind the cheering noises). 4) More badly-written announcer dialogue. 5) The worst choreographed ""fight"" in a ring that looks like it's been purchased 2 hours before shooting from a boxing gym. 6) 10 minutes of pointless follow-up.

Sound boring? Well don't worry, you get to watch that exact same thing like 5 times. Then the movie ends. Have you ever had a piece of toast, but not enough butter, so you make a lame attempt to stretch that butter across the entire piece of bread? That's pretty much what happened in this movie. A pretty bad idea that could only have filled up maybe a 20 minute short, but instead stretched out into a feature length film. It literally is agony to watch. The only reason I kept watching is because is the same reason people can't help but look at a car crash.

I get that some people like wrestling and some people like monsters. Fair enough. But this movie falls flat on it's face and you'll waste your time by watching this. They should show this to potential filmmakers to explain how not to make a good film.",1358553600,,2064,4.652054794520548
4992218,1,B006IXRKT2,"The ""story"" From Wikipedia:
The film depicts a wrestling-style fight to the death set inside an abandoned and cursed graveyard, shown in a pay-per-view style atmosphere. The fighters are eight classic movie monsters - Cyclops, Swamp Gut, Frankenstein's Monster, Lady Vampire, Werewolf, Mummy, Witch B-tch and Zombie Man. Acting as play-byplay announcer is Buzz Chambers (Dave Foley) with color commentating by former champ Sasquatch Sid (Art Hindle). The Brawl itself is divided into two classes: The Creature class and the Undead class. For the Creatures: Cyclops, Werewolf, Witch Bitch and Swamp Gut. For the Undead: Lady Vampire, Zombie Man, The Mummy and Frankenstein. Also two WWF alumni: Keven Nash and Jimmy Heart.

Oh boy. I get how the concept for this can lure people into wanting to watch this (that's what got me) but... wow this sucks. The special effects are OK at times, but I've seen films do better with less. I get it's supposed to be like wrestling but the monsters playing to the audience doesn't make sense when there isn't one.

The acting is crap and not even the good kind of crap acting. They should have had music cues for the monsters' entrances. It wouldn't have made it better, but using well known songs that fit the monsters would have gotten a cheap laugh. using the Edgar Winter song ""Frankenstein"" for instance.

It's obvious that it's trying to be comedic, but it fails and ends up being boring. I laughed harder at some ""Simon's Cat"" cartoons on YouTube than I laughed at this film. The only thing I truly thought was funny was when the Mummy was cutting his promo -- his dialog was subtitled...in hieroglyphics.

A major flaw with this film some of the back stories for the monsters would have made for better films by themselves.
The backstory for the Wolfman is a bit cliche, but would have been better as a film itself. He was in the woods with his pregnant wife. She ended up getting killed by a Werewolf. The husband trains in the cabin, arms himself and confronts the Werewolf that killed his wife and child. In the fight he's bitten and turns into a Werewolf himself. However he keeps his mind as the Wolfman out of vengeance of what happened. But don't let that story fool you into thinking the film is any good.
The creatively named Zombie Man's back story is kind of good as well (like a good no budget direct to video film) a group of soldiers find a zombie. The commanding officer decides to capture it and wants to use it to make the perfect soldier.

This film's concept would have made a better video game. Especially since they rip-off ""Mortal Kombat"" by having ""Not Shao Kahn"" saying ""outstanding"" and other phrases after some moves are performed.

If you like wrestling, comedies or horror films... don't watch this movie.

Believe me, I like watching bad movies to make fun of them. This movie's so bad that I can't even make fun of it. In the end this film is like communism. It looks good on paper but the reality is something else entirely... and crap.

I've seen some high praise reviews for this thing... those people either worked on the film, have no sense of humor (or good film making) or they have a blood alcohol level so high that they would give a Vampire cirrhosis of the liver from a prick on their finger.

4992230,4,B006IXRKT2,"It doesn't get any cheesier than this: a wrestling pay-per-view featuring eight of the world's most terrifying (albeit generic) monsters: Frankenstein, The Mummy, Lady Vampire, the Werewolf, Swamp Gut, Cyclops, Zombie Man, and, of course, Witch Bitch.  There's no Michael Booker asking fans ""Are You Ready to Rumbleeeeee?"" but that's just as well since there aren't any fans there.  The monsters are sort of shy around crowds, and the last thing promoters want is for some fans to get their arms torn off, so the ring is set up in a creepy old graveyard - a cursed, creepy old graveyard - in Michigan.  But hey, Jimmy ""Mouth of the South"" Hart is there, and Kevin Nash joins in the fun as Colonel Crookshanks, the man who's been secretly training Zombie Man for the past decade.  Providing the funniest play-by-play since Celebrity Deathmatch are Sasquatch Sid Tucker (Art Hindle) and Buzz Chambers (Dave Foley).  Is it stupid?  Of course, it's stupid - but what glorious stupidity.

These are death matches, folks.  Two monsters step in the ring, and only one leaves alive.  The only rule is that there are no rules.  You just know all of those tombstones around the ring are going to be put to good use.  I don't know why the two middle-weight winners don't wrestle for a championship but, let's face it, we're all really here to crown a heavyweight champ.  That's right, the winners of Werewolf vs. Swamp Gut and Frankenstein vs. Zombie Man must return to battle it out for the Monster Brawl Heavyweight Championship.  And what a glorious fight it is, with both men - ahem - monsters showing remarkable resilience and unbelievable heart in a monster fight for the ages.

If you think monsters can't wrestle, think again.  You'll see a number of actual wrestling moves, including the Figure Four (my favorite, despite the fact that my neighbor used to use that on me every time we wrestled as kids), the Sleeper, multiple clotheslines, and all kinds of good stuff.

I thought the make-up on the monsters looked awesome, and loved how this was presented in a WWE/Mortal Kombat like style of fighting! I thought using an abandoned graveyard and putting a ring right smack in the middle was a nice touch and gave the film a dark feel. If you like horror films, WWE wrestling, Mortal Kombat games... you will probably love this!

It's the Monstermania version of ""Wrestlemania!"" It's so cheesy, it had to be filmed in Wisconsin, but set in Michigan. I suppose they make cheese too, but I wouldn't want to eat it. It's so stupid, it's hilarious, at least at times. It's so bad, it's good!

Yes, it's ""Monster Brawl!"" The movie you've been waiting all your life to see! The movie that pits ""Creature,"" against ""Creature!"" ""The Undead,"" against ""the Undead!"" Even in two weight classes! Middle weight & heavy weight! But wait, there's more! The winners of their weight class & division are pitted against the winners of the other division, so we have get two world championship matches! ""Creature"" vs. ""the Undead!"" Heavy weight vs. heavy weight. Middle weight vs. middle weight. Oh the horror, the agony, the ecstasy! The gooey dripping cheese from my flat screen!

All jokes aside, this is a fairly clever monster bash. The makers of this film intended it to be so bad, it's good, & their good at doing it! No, this is no classic creature feature, but it's a great idea that I'm surprised has not been done before. It lampoons professional wrestling & movies like, ""Godzilla vs. King Kong"" & ""Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, & current film series, like ""Underworld"" & ""Twilight."" Yes, the film makers have an agenda here, & it works a good part of the time, to induce a good belly laugh or two.

Their are basically four segments' of this film. You get a little biography on each monster before a match, but unfortunately, more than not, this is pretty weak, only inducing a smile or two. More because of it's total corniness, than any genuine laughs. You have the two wrestling commentators, a big wink at the WWF & WWE, this works better, but not by much, other than when the matches are happening, which works well. In a bigger wink, you get Jimmy Hart, ""the Mouth of the South"" with two hot vixens in bikinis. This is very corny too, but works in the context of things. Then you get the matches, which are frankly, hilarious! The monster's make up, suitably cheesy for this cheesiest of films. The cheese is running hot! I mean, you got to take this all in context as it was meant to be taken. The matches are down right funny in their lampooning silliness, along with the commentators yakking it up, makes for a lot of fun!

Of course, the makers could've went the straight route, but that in it's self could've been a real cheese fest (especially with their low budget), unintended & no fun. So take ""Monster Brawl"" in the context it is meant to be, pop a beer, eats some potato chips, & have some fun with it! I did!",1354579200,,2617,4.536016949152542
4992233,4,B006IXRKT2,"When this was first recommended to me, it looked pretty shady.  In the first few minutes, you think it will just be played out in a jokey way.  By the time the first backstory is complete, you get a better sense of what this actually is.  It's a combo of an old school WWF event with some Mortal Kombat mixed in.  The narrator/God voice makes the movie work - once he gets going (""Appalling"") you can't wait to hear what he says next.

This movie should be watched with a bunch of friends on Halloween night. This is the kind of movie monster fans will love because it's all about monsters fighting and beating the hell out of each other. There is no plot in this movie, so sorry to all you well written story fans. This is not your movie.

One of the best things I loved about this movie is how well done the make-up for each of the monsters are. They all look great and scary. I loved the look to the monster ""Swap Gut"" which looks like an evil out of shaped Swap Thing. The make up also seems to work fine  during the fights, but the actors might have been hot in them.

The fights themselves were a blast to watch because they were fast, unpredictable, and silly. Certain monsters win in ways you wouldn't expect. There was also a ton of gore in it too for all us gore hounds. They also used a few ""real"" wrestling moves like the figure four leg lock used by ""WHOO"" Ric Flair! So if you like wrestling and monsters, this fights are for you!

The acting is what you expect from this movie. Both Dave Foley & Art Hindle steal the show as the commentators who witness the fights. They looked like they were having fun with the lines. At times, it seemed improvised. For example, Art Hindle would slightly hesitate while saying something. ""She used a tombstone as a weapon! I haven't seen that done in.......25 years!"" It's funny and it makes it a bit realistic. Lance Henriksen provides his voice in a Mortal Kombat stlye. He'll say the names of the monsters, their stats and comments like ""Great!"" Kevin Nash is also in the movie for a brief but funny time as Zombie Man's manager. He says some funny things in the movie like ""Alright Frankenstien you stiched up bastard!"" Hulk Hogan's former manager, Jimmy Hart plays the ring annoucer in this film who is also a funny crazy character. The rest is just the monster actors who all look like they are having a blast playing this parts.

Some bits though could have been shorten like the some of the monsters backstories and sometimes the fights go on a little longer than expected. Those are only slightly personal nit picks though.

Overall, this is a fun movie to watch. It's especially fun to watch around halloween time. This is the kind of movie you turn your brain off and be entertained.

Don't listen to the negative reviews for this movie, they don't know what a fun movie is when they see it. I had a huge grin on my face watching this because it was done so well with tongue planted firmly in cheek. People looking for something dark and serious need to look elsewhere. For people who just want to have a good time and whoop it up, this movie certainly shouldn't disappoint.",1347580800,,479,4.217391304347826
4992239,5,B006IXRKT2,"MMMMMMMMM! This is the reason I started watching wrestling! Wrestling is a shlocky romp of juveline stupidity, and this movie not only revels in that. It wears it proudly like a badge of honor. All the acting is deliciously over the top. Everyone involved is visibly having the time of their life. The action and violences is beautifully graffic and hilarious at the same time. You really feel the power and the viciousness of these monsters as they do battle in the ring and litterarly tear each other appart. And the pre match interview with the Mummy, had my friends and I crying we were laughing so hard.

That's what this movie is. It's a wrestling show with classic Monsters. And NO ambigious endings. Each match ends with a monster being killed. The actors are mostly wrestlers (Frankenstein you might recognize from Sherlock Holmes) So they not only chew the set, they pour mustard on the set and eat it with a tall glass of milk and a fork!

In fact the only thing I can say against it is this: I really wish there had been an audiance watching the matches. it might have really completed the look and made the zombie out break in the middle even more enjoyable. But that's like asking for chocolate sprinkles on Belgian Chocolate ice cream. It's just extra.

So if you're looking for a hilarous violent wrestling show and a truck load of laughs. Look no further than Monster Brawl!",1346284800,,1391,4.600806451612903

Had the creators added some kind of subplot or other story line, we might have had a cult classic here. As it stands, this is a failed experiment. Jimmy Hart was funny though. He was the highlight of the movie.",1343606400,,459,4.411764705882353
4992244,2,B006IXRKT2,"When I first heard about this movie I couldn't wait to see it. The whole concept just sounded like the best thing ever, an exploitation movie that combined two different genres into one and had them duking it out. What could go wrong when you have classic movie monsters involved in the sport of professional wrestling? Well several things.

The idea we have here is a promoter who decides that the most interesting thing there could be would be a battle between classic film monster in the squared circle, the wrestling ring. During an interview you get the idea that this concept came up over many cases of beer and a love for both items. Thus was born the Monster Brawl.

Since the monsters involved would more than likely kill any spectators, they've set up the ring in a secluded swamp land where they battles will take place. There are two categories of monsters, the undead and the creatures. Eight variations of these two categories will fight, the first two matches just to determine a winner and the last 3 matches to find a grand champion.

The first match is the weakest with two creatures facing off featuring a lame Cyclops against a Witch Bitch. The make up is lacking on both and the idea that either falls into the category of classic monster is non-existent. Next up is an undead battle between the Mummy and the Vampire Woman. Once again the make up isn't fantastic but better than the first one. Here we have two iconic monsters battling rather than semi-monsters like the first match.

But the big battle is a face off to see who the supreme monster is. This time around representing the creatures are the Werewolf versus Swamp Gut, a swamp thing rip off with a huge gut that helps him emit noxious odors. The winner of this match faces off against the winner of the undead play off between Frankenstein and Zombie Man. The Frankenstein monster has been brought back by a mad scientist while the Zombie Man is under the control of a mad military officer played by professional wrestler Kevin Nash. SPOILER ALERT: the result of these two matches is a match between the two most classic monsters here, Werewolf and Frankenstein.

There is no plot to this movie so don't expect one. This is nothing more than a pay per view match between monsters. The color commentary is handled by two men more than up to the task: Dave Foley (star of TV's NEWS RADIO and member of KIDS IN THE HALL) and actor Art Hindle who's starred in a number of horror items including THE BROOD. Both do a great job trading comments about the matches and trying to make things as normal as possible. The same holds true for guest announcer and ringmaster Jimmy ""Mouth of the South"" Hart, the classic WWE manager who does a great job here doing what he does best, talking up the matches.

So why does this great idea disappoint? For one it probably would have held up had there been a plot to the whole thing. Glimpses of matches between two lesser combatants rather than boring matches that did little more than fill up time would have made it more of a movie. More of a reason than just an idea some friends came up with while drinking would have made it more interesting as well.

With the exception of the Frankenstein monster the make up was really low brow. The same holds true for the wrestling action on display even though the characters were portrayed by a number of professional wrestlers from low level wrestling groups. It may be that because of the make up the wrestling didn't matter as much but the matches seemed like the first ones seen on major events where people are just showing up as opposed to the top line matches. With that as the focal point of the whole film they should have been better.

But this is not to say there isn't some heart on display here. It's easy to see why this concept was a good one that could have been tremendous. Had the WWE been backing this film up with some major talent and a bit more money, this could have been a movie that brought in viewers. Instead it's one of those curiosities that draws folks into film festivals and then heads straight to DVD. If you're a fan of classic monsters and wrestling then you'll want to give this one a watch. Otherwise pass it by.",1342569600,,4211,4.50261780104712
4992245,4,B006IXRKT2,"I heard bad things about this movie, but I was still very curious to see it. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews, because this movie is good ol' fashioned cheesy fun. You got eight classic monsters (Cyclops, Swamp Gut, Frankenstein, Lady Vampire, Werewolf, Mummy, Witch Bitch and Zombie Man) that battle each other to the death in a boxing ring in the middle of an abandoned and cursed graveyard. Buzz Chambers and Sasquatch Sid are the play-by-  play announcers. Before each battle, we see the monster's backstory and how they got there. Like I said, this would be great to watch around Halloween. I highly recommend MONSTER BRAWL!!!",1341792000,,650,4.803571428571429

4992247,2,B006IXRKT2,"Remember when you were a kid and you would dream of your favorite monsters battling each other? You would sit in school daydreaming about what it would be like to see Frankenstein's Monster battle the Werewolf or the Mummy get into hand-to-hand combat with the Creature from the Black Lagoon. This is something you no longer have to imagine. Thanks to Image Entertainment, ""Monster Brawl "" takes those very childhood fantasies and puts them on screen.

The movie is simple to describe. You take all your favorite horror movie creatures and throw them in a wrestling ring to battle it out with each other to the death. Throw in some intro sequences to give each monster's back story and some emcees dishing witty retorts back and forth and you've got a film that should satisfy both horror fans and wrestling fans.

The ""Monster Brawl"" Blu-ray has enough special features to satisfy fans of the movie, making it a worthwhile purchase for those who enjoy it. The film itself starts to drag and loses its novelty effect after a half hour to 45 minutes. I will tell you that I'd rather watch this several times over that sitting through one evening of WWE wrestling.
