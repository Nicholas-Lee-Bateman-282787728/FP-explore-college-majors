5852708,5,B00DSAUN1A,"GAMERA, the titanic, flying, fire-breathing turtle's greatest battles have been collected into one six-movie pack! His most challenging foes, including Barugon- the gigantic ice-fog-belching lizard! Gyaos- the big bat w/ the turtle-slicing laser! Guiron- the knife-headed martian monster! Viras- the squiddly diddly critter from beyond the stars! And Jiger- the hideous beast that really gives Big-G a run for his money! Yepper, all of the classics are here! If you love GAMERA, and you don't already own these films separately (as these versions have all been previously released), then you owe it to yourself to own this collection...",1364256000,,636,5.5
5852709,3,B00DSAUN1A,"To start with, this is a 2 disc set with 3 movies on each disc. The discs are one sided, so that's good. Each movie has only 4 chapters scene select. Now as far as aspect ratio is concerned, 5 of the 6 movies are presented in 1.33:1 standard full screen. Only Return of The Giant Monsters is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen. I suspect the print for that one is from Shout! Factory double feature vs Gyaos/ vs Viras. It seems the only thing they did was paste a large title card of Return of the Giant Monsters over the original Japanese title. Gammera The Invincible, War of The Monsters, Destroy All Planets, and Attack Of The Monsters appear to be the same prints used by Alpha Video. Gamera vs Monster X is from whatever source it came from. What bothers me is the opening of the Gamera dn dn dn dn Gamera dn dn dn dn is omitted from Gammera The Invincible. If you have an interest in Gamera and don't have any dvds this is a good place to start. 6 movies for a very low price is a pretty good deal, but if you already have all the Gamera movies on better dvds then you really don't need this set. Before I forget, these are the AIP dubs. The bonus feature: The Monster Files is just an on-screen 1 page per monster written description.",1360022400,43,1238,4.227848101265823

Sure, the video quality isn't always great, but for the price you're still getting a good deal. As for the quality of the movies, I have to admit that Gamera movies defy critical assessment.

5852730,3,B00DSAUN1A,The discs I received were apparently used. I thought I was buying a new set and not a used item. One of the DVD's had several scratches and marks and one was scratch free and new. Fortunately so far it seems to play well. The DVD package was still shrink wrapped and unopened though.

I mean really these movies are in great shape even after so many years. Even the black and white version was good to see. I can't complain because the price is so cheap.,1438387200,,326,4.030769230769231

5852738,5,B00DSAUN1A,"Don't get me wrong, I love the shout factory releases. Having the films in wonderfully sourced HD quality is great. Also having BOTH English dubs of ""most"" of them is great also. However this set has the films as I originally saw them on TV in the late 70's early 80's. Also this is one way to get the original English Dub  of Gammera the Invincible & War of the Monsters  that the S!F sets did not include (there are other independent DVD's but this is an easy/inexpensive way to get them all together). Now... If only someone would release on DVD -Gamera Super Monster with the original Filmways title intro/end credits",1435190400,,621,4.535714285714286

5852740,5,B00DSAUN1A,"This DVD set has got mixed reviews so I thought I'd chime in. Yes, the images are fuzzy and yes the colors are washed out, but that was the technology of that era. Sure it could be a little better, but the movies are still great and entertaining as is, they are reminiscent of the old ""Creature Double Features"" many enjoyed as kids and can relive with kids today, my 7 year old enjoys them despite the ancient film quality.",1427241600,,424,4.3125

5852763,5,B00DSAUN1A,"very campy and corny.  Love it, from the camp of corn.  I you were like me and grew up watching movies like this on KTLA cable. video quality is low but that's how it was filmed.",1404086400,,178,3.9166666666666665
5852764,4,B00DSAUN1A,"if you're browsing amazon for good deals on a bunch of gamera films in one set, this may or may not not be for you.  It really depends most (i think) on one's preference for dubbing or original Japanese with subtitles.  I do like the dubbing, just because it adds to the campiness of it all, but it's important to know that the ones in this collection are all dubbed, often quite badly, with no option for original japanese. and while 6 films for 5 bucks is great, this set DOES NOT have Gamera v. Zigra and Gamera The Super Monster on it, which it should.  These two aforementioned films are available as a double-feature disc elsewhere on amazon, but for three times the price of this six film set. It's not like the two that are missing here come from the next Gamera era either, Zigra and Super Monster came later than the first 6, but they both had the same director as 5 of the films in the WotM collection. so it's kinda b.s. that they weren't thrown in as well.  But if you like dubbed Kaijus, get this.

 OR.  IF YOU DO NOT CARE FOR THE CAMPY DUBBY BEAUTY OF DUBBING.  You could have a look at the Gamera Legacy Collection.  like 9 bucks for 11 movies, all Gameras from '65 to '99.  But here's the catch (or the uber awesome bonus for the more purist personalities) the ones on the Legacy pack are all in Japanese with subtitles, with no other options.  So, if you like the movies in their original Japanese form, and have no interest in dubbing or American cuts of the film for their American releases, get away from the War of the Monsters set.  Go buy the Legacy collection. (Or look into Gamera on blu-ray, there are some awesome deals there as well, but, again, only for those who do not care for the dubs and just want to get their hands on the pure Japanese originals.  Can't say i blame purists, it's all a matter of how you like to take in the movie.)  Either way, if Japanese cinematic delivery is what you seek get the good deal that we dub-loving people cannot take advantage of, because of the lack of satisfaction that we would receive in the category of dub-loving.

it's a tough decision for a lot of people.",1404086400,5,2133,4.31077694235589

5852804,4,B00DSAUN1A,"This DVD set is decent. Not for the monster movie enthusiast/purist like myself. 5 of these 6 movies are not widescreen, which is good if you're looking to re-experience your days watching these movies during ""Creature Double Feature"". However, these full screen movies look like they are digitized directly from VHS versions of the films themselves. I would know, I've been putting my Godzilla tapes to DVD. The quality looks about the same, decent but washed out and with some grain.

Gamera vs. Gyaos aka Return of the Giant Monsters is the only movie on this DVD that even looks remotely ""remastered"".

That said, for the price, and the number of movies included, if you aren't worried about quality you will enjoy this purchase. Each disc has only one side, and has packed 3 movies on each disc (2 in total). This may explain why many of the movies are such low quality visually. But again, if quality isn't your concern for these movies then you'll be proud to say you own 6 Gamera movies among your DVD selection.

If you are a huge kaiju movie buff like myself, it's best to avoid this collection and save up your cash for the Shout! Factory DVD's which come in Widescreen AND have both the English dub and the original Japanese versions.",1381881600,16,1246,4.654545454545454
