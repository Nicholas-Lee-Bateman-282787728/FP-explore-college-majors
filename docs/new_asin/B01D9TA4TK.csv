7709657,1,B01D9TA4TK,Least favorite of all the American Girl movies. The filming was terrible and it looked like a amateur filmed it.,1465516800,6,112,4.65
7709658,3,B01D9TA4TK,This movie is not up to the quality of the past American Girl movies. Acting was just OK. Lea was too emotional when she left the tribe. It just didn't make sense that Lea would take off on her own in a rain forest and follow a trail that was dangerous. The movie was just too phony.,1465257600,6,283,3.982456140350877
7709659,5,B01D9TA4TK,My daughter and her friend LOVED it!!,1465257600,3,37,4.428571428571429
7709660,5,B01D9TA4TK,Great movie my 8 year old loves it,1465257600,3,34,3.375
7709661,5,B01D9TA4TK,My daughter and I really enjoyed the movie. My daughter is in 3 rd grade and her class just did a project on Brazil so she loved that the story was set in Brazil.,1465257600,3,162,3.7941176470588234
7709662,2,B01D9TA4TK,"My daughters - ages 6 and 8 - really disliked this movie, and as an adult, it was painful to sit through. From the overacting of the actors playing Lea and her brother, to the constant poor decisions made by all adults in the movie, this just didn't do anything for us!",1465084800,29,269,4.1923076923076925

7709667,5,B01D9TA4TK,I really liked this movie. I am a 20 year old  boy and I rented this ans I liked it.,1506211200,,84,3.2
7709668,3,B01D9TA4TK,She is too sassy and has bad attitude towards adults for my 7 year old to watch. Too many bad guys too.,1505433600,,103,3.727272727272727

7709671,2,B01D9TA4TK,"I came into the film hoping for more. The ploy was fine as American Girl movies go. I was able to get pass the acting, but not the cultural tropes. 1st: Outside of the opening shots, this is not Brazil. When Aki showed up speaking 1950's broken English and wearing a snake around her neck, I was like ""huh""?  Then they head back to her village to see the natives , who clearly look like Indian.. yes, the South Asian kind, I felt so disappointed. I have an issue with natives being such a throw away that anyone dark skinned will do. I wanted to like this cute little film, but left feeling insulted culturally. Why no just say the country is South Africa - it's clearly not Brazil. Nough respect to the actresses; not their fault that the Producer took advantage of them.",1503705600,,772,4.361111111111111
7709672,4,B01D9TA4TK,Movie was skipping so that was somewhat frustrating and disappointing.,1501459200,,70,6.1
7709673,2,B01D9TA4TK,"Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter. The main character, Lea is rude and obnoxious, has no respect for authority and constantly places herself in dangerous situations! I cant stand the kid! Not a good role model for young girls! One star for beautiful scenes of Brazil,the other for Lea caring about her brother.",1500422400,2,320,4.836363636363636
7709674,4,B01D9TA4TK,my 8 year old loves it and she said it was a little scary and does not like that animals in movie get caged up.,1500076800,,111,3.48
7709675,1,B01D9TA4TK,"Story was interesting but after about 30 minutes I couldn't take it anymore.  This 10 year old girl was disrespectful, disobedient, not grateful and had zero manners.  Exactly opposite of what I want to teach my kids.  I appreciate the fact they want to portray her as a brave young determined girl, which is fine, but they could have done it in a way where she was still kind and respectful to those that are watching her.  Awful!",1499126400,2,431,4.487179487179487
7709676,5,B01D9TA4TK,Great movie and really shows how much lea loves her brother zac even if she disobeyed her parents she did do it to save her brother who she loved and in the end her mom told her a d taught all the viewers a valuable lesson. I would read the book though that one teaches girls a lot more than the movies.,1496275200,,303,3.903225806451613
7709677,5,B01D9TA4TK,Enjoyed this movie as a family.  My 10 year old loves AG books.  My sons also enjoyed this movie.  Offers much adventure and action parts.  My kids are 5-10 years old.,1495670400,,167,4.290322580645161

7709679,5,B01D9TA4TK,My daughter has the Lea doll so we had to watch the movie.  It was a cute movie and I enjoyed watching it.  My daughter is 6 and she enjoyed it too.,1494720000,,148,3.59375
7709680,5,B01D9TA4TK,"The last time I heard about poaching and kidnapping it was on ""Law & Order Special Victims Unit"" add that to the fact that the likely survival of kidnapping victims reduced drastically in 48 hours, and you've got adult subject matter in a move for GIRLS. This definitely NOT what Feminists think of when they think ""Pink Aisle"" because girls are too ladylike to be morbid; and did I mention the kidnapping victim is a grown man?! Make no mistake, it's handled in a G-Rated way, but it's nice to think that American Girl thinks girls can handle Crime Stories just as well as boys! It's also a nice callback to their Period Films, which dealt with serious subject matter, and provided serious solutions, unlike ""My Little Pony Friendship is Magic"" I LOVE that Lea is so defiant and rude, unlike the perfect ""Mary Sues"" in the period films, submissive manners are pushed so much on girls... IT'S SEXIST! ""Felicity An American Adventure"" will help parents learn WHERE our ideas about rudeness come from, and how much of it is GENDER specific. Girls shouldn't have to be nice ALL THE TIME. Another perfectly shot film, with beautiful settings.",1493078400,,1138,4.752525252525253

7709683,3,B01D9TA4TK,"While I like this movie, I don't recommend comparing it to other American Girl movies as this is an adventure-genre film. If you're not interested in the adventure genre, don't buy. While she makes hasty and unsafe decisions in the wild, I don't hate her for doing that (Have you seen Dora the Explorer? She goes off alone all the time and no parents cared.) but I hate HOW SHE DOES IT. She has good intentions but isn't much more than an unprepared brat. Congrats to her for saving her bro, but she needs to learn a lesson as there are safer and better ways for her to reach her objective. Overall, she's a decent character but I wouldn't say she's a role model. Too bad",1491004800,,671,4.333333333333333
7709684,2,B01D9TA4TK,"Lea to the Rescue is about Lea Clark, the Girl of the Year from 2016.
I did not enjoy this movie too much. It was pretty unrealistic. Some of the other Girl of the Year movies can be a bit unrealistic, but this one was more so.
Lea was also pretty bossy and a little disobedient too.
I just really didn't care too much for this movie.",1490659200,,334,4.0

7709695,2,B01D9TA4TK,"Normally I love the American Girl movies, but this one had the lead character, Lea, making all kinds of very dangerous choices. I would definitely not want my girls making the same choices as the American Girl featured in this movie.

7709697,5,B01D9TA4TK,"I was hesitant to let our girls watch this after reading other reviews so my husband and I watched it first to make sure it was ok.  We thought it would be fine for them and I think we are generally pretty conservative as to what movies we think are ok.  For example, we thought the 'secret lives of pets' was horrible and won't let them see it again but this one we purchased and they can watch it over and over.  Great for anyone but one of our daughters does have the Lea doll so that makes it extra special I think.",1485129600,,519,4.019417475728155

7709705,1,B01D9TA4TK,"I agree with many of the other parents that found this to be the worst movie yet. My two little ones enjoy the American Girl movies but this one was very had to watch.

My mom decided to give it a try and we watched it this afternoon and were pleasantly surprised. The other reviewers complained about Lea being bratty and defiant, well she wasn't she was a determined girl just like in all the other american girl movies, intact I liked Lea better then McKenna, Isabel and saige. Lea is 10 years old and she once saved her dad in Brazil on their last visit. Well this time she saves her brother, he was kidnapped by poachers and they lo led him in a cage. Lea and her brother's girlfriend go into the amazon rainforest looking for him. They meet a young Brazilian girl who helps them, she let's them meet her tribe and Lea and her brother's girlfriend spend the night and sleep in hammocks. They get back to the city and they are chased by poachers. Lea saves her brother by doing a daring stunt, risking her life for her brother. It all ends well the police catch the poachers, Lea's brother is safe and Lea enters all her pictures she took in Brazil in an exhibit and wears the new white dress mom bought for her.

7709740,1,B01D9TA4TK,"My 10-year old daughter and I have seen all of the AG movies, and while I didn't care for some of them, we felt that there was at least entertainment value in most of them.  We thought that a few of them were pretty good.  NOT this one - I had a really hard time believing that AG actually put this out.  The only way I could salvage the experience of watching this incredibly awful movie was to turn some of the most offensive lines into comedy when my daughter and I discussed it afterward.

Here is a prime example, and the material for such jokes just keeps coming throughout the movie.  Situation:  Your family has a dinner guest from another country whom you are meeting for the first time.  She is sweet, clearly anxious to make a good impression, and too polite to let the family know that she is vegetarian - and your family is serving steak.  You, (the Lea character), choose to say:  a)  ""Some of my friends are vegetarian, I've had wonderful meals at their homes.""  b)  ""My mom makes the best salads, and we have lots.""  or c) (loudly and obnoxiously) ""Hey, Dad!  Can I have HER food?  Your steaks rock!""

You guessed it (or have witnessed it) - the answer was c).  And it all spirals downhill from there.  The obnoxious, blatantly rude, and downright bullying lines that the Lea character was given are unbelievable - I've never known any kid as bad or as poorly raised as this.  In the course of this movie, this obnoxiously defiant and inconsiderate behavior almost gets her and others killed.  Her brother's girlfriend (the aforementioned dinner guest) clearly saves Lea's life time and again, as well as her brother's, only to be treated like dirt by someone who is  supposed to be the heroine of the movie.  Why? - because Lea is so immature that she believes this kindly, intelligent woman will totally destroy Lea's position of being the one and only focus of her brother's life.  There is absolutely no positive role model here.  The Lea character in this movie is the farthest thing from any notion of a positive role model.

The only thing I can think of to explain this disaster is that the scriptwriters just got in way over their heads while spinning a very badly constructed plot, and there was no way to pull out and salvage the movie after a critical mass of money was spent.  I am guessing that they did, in fact, spend a great deal more money trying to recover some sense of a viable plot, because there was clearly nothing left over for to pay for producing scenes that would bring forward any semblance of the serious issues of wildlife poaching and habitat destruction.  The promise of a movie that could highlight these issues and demonstrate some effective ways in which they are being addressed was what my daughter and her friends were looking forward to.  As it was, the few isolated shots of some of the beautiful rainforest animals could easily have been purchased from an outside vendor, as far as we could tell.

I totally agree with all of the negative reviews of this movie, and I strongly disagree with all of the positive comments.  My daughter has been able to look any adult straight in the eye and hold an intelligent conversation with them since she was little.  She is not a submissive pushover - quite the opposite.  She has stood up to teachers when she thought they were mistreating classmates.  She has the confidence to deal effectively with bullies.  Among her favorite books are the AG books for girls - she has read the AG Guide to Manners for Girls multiple times.  She already knows full well that girls like the character Lea in this movie cannot reach their full potential, in large part because they have not learned basic manners and how to interact positively and constructively with others.  We learn manners because we care about our families and about other people - not because we are submissive or obsequious, for Pete's sake.  Most of us learned this in kindergarten.

Obviously, neither the writers of this movie's script nor the executives at AG who cleared this movie have bothered to read their own published guidebooks for girls.  So sad.  The potential of this story - including the character and the setting - was huge.  I'd have thought it would have been difficult to throw away the opportunity.",1476144000,7,4277,4.611920529801324

Also, the actress that played Lea is not the same model that was used in promotions ie: cut out at the American Girl stores etc.  That was confusing to my daughter.",1474243200,,258,4.244897959183674
7709747,2,B01D9TA4TK,"My 10-year-old daughter loves American Girl. We own all of the movies (both historic and GOTY), and especially since Lea is from our hometown of St. Louis, we looked forward to this movie.
Unfortunately, we both found the movie extremely lacking.
First, a major annoyance of mine is that Lea's brother's has more than a hint of an Australian or English accent. Couldn't they have found a speech coach for him? I don't expect him to have the St. Louis accent, but he should at least sound American.
Second, as others have pointed out, so much of this movie is unbelievable. Lea and her brother's girlfriend walk into the rainforest (even crossing a river on a board), and find a rarely-seen indigenous tribe. Of course. The tribe has the entire Amazon in which to live, but lives just on the outskirts of the city.
And Lea is a pushy little girl, putting herself and others into danger many times.
I read all of the Lea books, and while they didn't have the (completely unbelievable) drama of the movie, they were good, solid stories. I think the movie would have been better if they had stuck closer to the books' themes.
These movies can help drive sales of the doll and accessories. My daughter asked for and received the Grace doll and a few of her accessories last year after seeing (many times) the Grace movie. (Honestly, the only GOTY movie worth watching in my opinion). She has said she doesn't want the Lea doll, which is kind of a disappointment to me, again, since it's a St. Louis doll.
Hopefully AG will reach higher with any new movies they make.",1474156800,,1561,4.578571428571428

7709751,2,B01D9TA4TK,"I usually love American Girl. My daughter and I watch and play together. I had such a hard time with this script, though. The main character is not an example of a girl being brave; instead she's reckless and stubborn and doesn't listen. She doesn't just put herself at risk over an over, but insists that others also follow her into danger. I am all in favor of fun and determination, but lying to parents and blatant disregard for safety of self and others is not typical for AG, but is in scene after scene. It's just behavior that no parent wants to reinforce. I had to stop the movie to make sure my kid knew that in no uncertain terms was Lea Clark a role model.

She is disrespectful, disobedient, and flat out whiny. She gets herself and others into  potentially deadly situations, and the clueless/ineffective adults don't do anything about it!

If I had watched the movie first, we probably wouldn't have gotten the doll.  Lea is a sassy, selfish, spoiled rotten know-it-all.  She doesn't respect any adults or authority, disobeying everything her parents and other authority figures in the movie.  I couldn't believe it was even an American Girl movie! I don't ever worry about my kids watching AG movies, but with this one I felt the need to remind them that children DO NOT behave this way or talk to their parents this way. She puts herself and others in danger, doing whatever she pleases because SHE thinks it's right.  The movie was also extremely unrealistic.  Really? They stopped poachers that the police had been trying to catch for years? Please.

Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed in the movie ""Lea to the Rescue.""  Throughout the movie, she back talked to various adults and completely disobeyed them, such as when she was told to not to steal the raft and cross the potentially dangerous river, etc.  She was also quite sullen and often disrespectful.  I understand that this movie was attempting to portray a ""modern day girl"" but is this really the type of example you wish to set for impressionable young children?  Please don't  use an excuse which attempts to claim that children from previous generations were more respectful--it doesn't have to be that way!

She's 5 and only now starting to get into American Girl stuff, but I played with them as a child (Samantha, Molly and Kirsten!) and have a soft spot in my heart for the franchise. This was a very cute movie and very good production quality. The story was adventurous and empowering: a young girl traveling to Brazil and exploring the city and the Amazon to rescue her older brother who's gotten entangled in an animal poaching scheme. All the AG themes are there- friendship, family, confidence, honesty, doing the right thing, etc... I recognized the mother from Lizzie Maguire (and a guest spot on Golden Girls; wow I'm old) but the rest of the cast was very good. My favorite character was the young Amazonian girl- very talented!

7709801,5,B01D9TA4TK,"WARNING: This American Girl movie needs to be watched and talked about together or not watched at all. Lea did a number of things she knew her mother and others didn't want her to and it  worked out well in the end. Seldom does this happen in real life, but seldom is a person a hero by keeping them self safe. A hero is someone that sees there are some things worth taking some risk. Why not call the police a number of them said, but her brother seemed to act like he didn't trust his work mates or the police. I picked that up when he told her. It is one of the frustrations of our days. Police have a quota of tickets they must pass out on top of their other duties. Our police forces are run with profit and loss equal to service to the public and their hands are tied in so many ways. I knew this at ten and it's worse now then then. Lea is a good kid who loves her parents. That love restrains her to a point but when that love is threatened she will not be stopped from her goal. Most of the American Girl movies are about the changes of growing up. This one is too, it's about deciding to do what is right for you regardless of the norm.
First off let me say I've got all the American Girl movies, including digital ones of the two shorts of late. I've been into them since my girl was 9. She's 17 now. LOL. We wait eagerly for the next movie because so far we have had our own adventures with every one of them. We have used every one of the movies as a chance to grow and bond. Be it Cooking cupcakes or visiting the space and rocket Center or seeing old Jamestown it was time together that we will hold on to, for the rest of our lives.
This one was different. I understood Lea like no other American Girl. The same complains I hear from the people that didn't like the movie I heard about me. And Lea had the same problem I had, no body listened when she talked. The adults wanted Lea to listen to them and be safe but no body listened to her. I heard people say she didn't respect and stay safe. I say she did respect that's why she told them. They didn't respect her by listening and having been Lea I can tell you it made me do just the sort of thing she did,run off on my own and do it myself. Was it not Samantha's Grandmeir that said, ""It takes two to speak the truth, One to speak and the other to hear.""?
I think you need to sit down and talk with your child or children if and when they watch this film. Make sure they know what she did could lhave gotten her and her brothers girlfriend killed as well as the whole tribe of natives. That my friends is not good.",1469232000,10,2584,3.998065764023211

This movie had the potential to educate our girls about another culture and the beauty within, yet it did very little of that.  The majority of this movie was spent chasing bad guys and being exposed to dark elements. There's enough darkness in this world. We hoped this year's American Girl movie would shed light on the beauty and peace to be found.

Unfortunately, there is nothing in this American Girl movie that I hope my daughter emulates.  Lea goes against all good advice and good sense in trying to get her point across. When her mother did not listen initially, Lea went on to act in ways that were disrespectful at best and dangerous at worst, rather than find creative ways to express herself. Her actions, while well-intended, let her into situations that in reality are beyond dangerous for any real girl without the proper supplies and guidance.  Spunk and determination do not have to present themselves as recklessly throwing oneself into extreme danger.

I was concerned that this would be a ""dumbed down"" look at some of the issues facing indigenous people it actually did a fairly decent job giving a glimpse into another culture and just as importantly the need to preserve the privacy of the culture.  Where it fell short was that it glorified some truly terrible choices on the part of our main character (she could have been killed about 100 times over during the course of the film, and at least half of those would have been entirely her own fault) but since I don't anticipate that my daughters will find themselves alone in the rain forest any time soon I suppose I can embrace the message of ""girl empowerment"" that I know the film was trying to send.  Is it predictable?  Oh, yes...very much so.  Would I watch it more than once?  Sure.  Is it worth having in our American Girl collection?  Yes.  Is it the best in the collection? No.  Nothing will ever beat the historical films as far as I'm concerned, but it's the best in the past few years.",1467676800,,1019,4.372340425531915

My only real complaint is that Lea Clark - the girl of the year - was rude and bratty, disobedient to adults AND rewarded for it. What was the morale of the story? Disobeying your parents and other adults is ok when masked with bravery? She went against Paola, she disobeyed her mom. Her disobedience went unpunished, in fact it was celebrated. After all, if she'd obeyed, the brother may not have been found alive.
  Sadly, this is no different from most of the movies of this day. However, I've grown to expect the exact opposite from American Girl.",1467676800,11,649,4.436974789915967

She's SPIRITED. Aren't these qualities we want modern American girls to possess? To suggest that our daughters should be obsequious and do whatever we tell them to do is to ignore the reality about girlhood. Lea's mission in this film is to find her brother -- she's a HERO!

7709839,3,B01D9TA4TK,"Not offended by Lea's attitude, but storyline not the norm for American Girl

We are strict with the attitudes our kids view via movie/TV, but I allowed my 7 year old to watch this mainly because it is American Girl.  Lea does disobey her parents, and I do not love her attitude, but I would rather my 7 year old watch this movie than most of the Disney TV shows in terms of the characters' attitudes.  I do hope American Girl does not continue in this vein of movies as opposed to their usual movies that are historical or touch on a topic that my daughter could actually face in real life.  Fighting for an art program in schools (Saige), overcoming difficulty in dance class (Isabelle), while often exaggerated to an extraordinary level are much more realistic than my child running away in Brazil and encountering a tribal community in order to rescue a kidnapped brother.
Overall I felt Lea was a cute movie, I do not regret letting my 7 year old watch it. Please American Girl....go back to the historical girls or at very least continue with the scenarios that are more real life than the plot for Lea's movie.

The main character was an unmitigated, disrespectful brat who was rewarded for her bad behavior by showing that being obnoxious and rule breaking equals success.  The plot was totally idiotic with at least half the movie spent in dopey chase scenes and there was very little character development.  There were some Disney-ish scenes with a very well scrubbed and dressed Brazilian tribe that seemed poorly researched.  The acting was noticeably uneven bordering on poor as well but you could get over that if it wasn't for the rest of it.  A real disappointment coming from the American Girl franchise.

7709857,5,B01D9TA4TK,"We've heard lots about this movie, disrespectful, walked out early, etc. My review is to approach this from yet another perspective while clarifying that in no way do we condone disrespect/disobedience. (My children are NOT ''sassy'' or disrespectful. They have 'moments' like 'normal' kids.) I've honestly heard much worse from some kids out there these days! This was nothing like any of that!) That said, we saw Lea as passionate and deeply concerned for the safety of her brother. Sometimes adults don't listen to their children. Children are capable of listening to their instincts without always being able to express themselves to the adults in their lives. If you can get beyond the earlier parts that may seem ''sassy, etc.''  you will discover that Lea is correct and gravely, justifiably concerned for her brother. Back to reality, haha, this is an adventure about a doll with American Girl and company bringing the world of Lea to life, a continuation of her story. It's make believe with lessons incorporated. Poaching is a very real problem, issues in the Amazon, etc. and among it's peoples are very real. Maybe this helps to bring attention to those issues while enjoying seeing a popular, loved company bring this doll to life (as they have done with other character/doll movies) . It's easy to misconstrue the actress as ''sassy/disrespectful"" but we saw her as stated above and took the opportunity to discuss these issues between parents and children who viewed this. If you didn't watch the movie all the way through you missed some good stuff with the tribal people and the girl ""Aki"" and one really special moment about Lea's ""Ama""/grandmother. No it's not perfect but it was an ADVENTURE and that we LIKED :) GREAT JOB, Maggie Elizabeth Jones, Storm Reid-we LOVED your characters :) GREAT JOB everyone on this movie and thank you for a fun adventure and for sharing Brazil, the Amazon, etc. and it's people/culture with us  :)",1466985600,3,1950,4.942073170731708

7709872,5,B01D9TA4TK,"My daughters and I loved watching this empowered little girl fight to save her brother. I had read reviews that complained that Lea was sassy and defiant - okay, but did anyone else notice that Lea tried repeatedly to tell her mom and Paula what was going on?? The mother is just as culpable here! My daughters and I had a very good discussion following the movie about the importance of listening to EACH OTHER (not just them listening to me). Kids are smart these days and they should not only speak when spoken to. We tell our kids ""see something, say something"" - well, she did until someone (Paula) listened - and then convinced that grownup to help her. Lea is an example of a modern kid who didn't give up. This movie also raised many questions and started discussions about other cultures. Her friendship with the native girl was something nice to see. We would have liked to have seen more of that, especially in a time when American kids are witnessing the world turn against people from different cultures. Sure, there were a few leaps of faith to be taken on this adventure, but it's a movie ;-)
Thank you, American Girl, for giving us a character with a strong will, a friend from a foreign culture, and a fun, empowering story!",1466899200,2,1241,4.52
7709873,4,B01D9TA4TK,"We anxiously awaited the arrival of this movie: we had bought the Lea doll on New Year's Day when she was released.  She is beautiful, as are her outfits.  My daughter was really hoping this movie would extend the Lea storyline from the books.  While many of Lea's outfits are shown here in the movie, like her hiking outfit, pajamas, and celebration dress, we didn't see the big ticket items like the beach house or fruit stand.  I'd think that American Girl would want to throw these into the movie for sales purposes.  And how cool would it have been for Lea to have thqt beach house in the movie?  We were hoping that maybe they'd have some kind of awesome storyline where they showed up (maybe a big sale at the fruit stand to help finance a failing animal conservation group).  Still, how many kids are going to be so excited to point out that there are mathcing kid/doll outfits for this girl of the year doll?  I heard the squeals as we watched the movie: ""Oooh!  Look!  Lea's pajamas!  I have those for my doll, but they must make big ones too!  I NEED those!""  Wow, thanks, American Girl.

My daughter kept saying that the actress playing Lea didn't really look like what she had pictured--the doll is very tan and this girl is very pale in comparison,  Thankfully, her spunky presonality shines through.  We were a bit concerned about Lea's snippy/rotten attitude.  The eye rolling and backtalk were things that are no-no's here and I heard audible gasps from my daughter a few times when Lea sassed adults.

My daughter LOVED this movie.  I found it to be hokey and very unbelievable (really--a tribe out in the Amazon rainfirest that just happens to speak English? What kind of people go running into a rainforest to catch ""bad guys"" with no plans or supplies?  And why is a kid in charge of making life or death decisions?).  It just didn't add up.

If you're okay with watching sassy little girls defy the rules and be rude to adults, then I guess this is the movie for you.  I think the older movies (Kit, Chrissa, and Felicity, just to name a few) are much better productions and have valuable lessons to learn about friendship and family.  The best part about this dvd was that it came with a coupon for American GirlL $10 off a $100 purchase.",1466899200,,2261,4.485294117647059

7709904,1,B01D9TA4TK,"Amazing! Another educational story from American Girl! This movie in particular spoke to me personally. In the past, I had often wanted to do disobedient things behind my parents back, but I was always concerned about getting in trouble. This movie changed my perspective. The moral is very clear. As Lea put it at one point in the movie, ""It's time to stop thinking and just do."" I need to be like that. I need to stop worrying about how my choices will affect the future. It's this frame of mind that caused Lea to disobey and deceive her mom and do the dangerous things she did. Of course, my story may not end as happy as Lea's did. After all, it can be deadly for a 10 year old girl to tell her mom she's at a babysitter's house and then go chasing after dangerous poachers (equipped with only a camera) while swimming in a river with anacondas and numerous other deadly creatures. Most girls who do things like that end up dead, and- Oops. Sorry... I'm thinking again. I need to stop doing that! Don't think. Just do (as Lea insisted when her babysitter tried to talk some sense into her). It should be every girl's goal to be like Lea. She's strong, independent, deceptive, defiant, disobedient, and is disrespectful to authority. She told her babysitter off very forcefully when she asked Lea if she wanted a snack, and she relentlessly harassed her to the point of being completely uncontrollable as she ran into the Amazon rainforest with no plan or equipment. Bonus points for getting her babysitter out there in high heels, and with hardly any way to call for help if they actually did catch up with the dangerous poachers who kidnapped her brother. In the bonus features on the DVD, one of the actors said that they thought it was a movie that young girls can learn from. I absolutely agree! This movie can put a lot of ideas in a girl's head. 90 percent of the girls that get ideas from this movie won't be coming home, but at least they can disobey their parents and have an adventure without worrying about the consequences of their actions. Don't think. Just do. Every girl needs to see this movie. We are the girls of the next generation, and we refuse to let parents, rules, intelligent thinking, reality, and fear of the consequences keep us from having an adventure!

If you want to stay friends, then STAY IN CONTACT. Second, Lea Clark, is rude and kind of a brat.  Almost every AG movie I have seen the main characters are dramatic. Grace Thomas was the only girl of  the year as well as Chissa who were not dramatic. American girl has to returned to  this pattern of the girl of the years of being dramatic but instead chose to make Miss  Clark a brat. Well done AG! Girls should be friendly, kind, loving, sweet, obedient, respectful and just fun to be around to everyone, I mean EVERYONE. Not just your relatives.

7709946,2,B01D9TA4TK,"Really disappointed in this movie. My family has appreciated American girl in the past for creating characters that represent what we would like to see in our daughter.  Unlike the Disney channel tween characters, they seemed to respect their parents and other authority figures.  In this movie Lea refuses to obey any of her authority figures and the parents and sitter seem to know very little, painting the child as the one with all knowledge.  I would love to see American girl return to characters that show respect and honor for authority.",1466035200,50,545,4.9021739130434785
7709947,1,B01D9TA4TK,My daughter stopped watching. AG movies had good messages and interesting stories. This was a story about a brat kid making terrible life threatening choices. Trash,1466035200,8,164,5.346153846153846
7709948,3,B01D9TA4TK,"My daughter really enjoys the American Girl movies, but this one was the worst one we've seen so far. In this movie Lea was pretty sassy and sarcastic to her parents and older people. I haven't experienced that in any of the other AG movies. Such a bummer - we were waiting for awhile for this to come out and I was pretty disappointed with her attitude. That's what we like so much about AG is the innocence and integrity in the young characters. We did not find this as much in this one.",1465948800,54,489,4.212765957446808

7709962,1,B01D9TA4TK,"The child in the movie is disobedient and defiant. Her babysitter has no control over her and is forced to follow the child's lead. American Girl is a brand that was founded on realism and historical accuracy. This is the worst of the American Girl movies, and most of the ""adventure"" would expose a real child to serious danger.",1465948800,9,329,4.593220338983051
7709963,2,B01D9TA4TK,"Least favorite of all AG movies! Poor acting, unbelievable storyline, awkward pacing.",1465862400,3,85,6.166666666666667
7709964,1,B01D9TA4TK,"This movie was a complete disappointment. My daughter is almost six and has loved all the other AG movies we have seen- this one was way too scary for her and our 10 year old niece. The brother is abducted, bad guys and violence... It is just way too much for this themed type of movie. We had planned on buying the doll and accessory sets like we have the previous years, but my daughter is terrified of the whole theme after this movie.",1465862400,9,438,4.226190476190476
7709965,4,B01D9TA4TK,Very good little movie - a little more adventure/suspense than previous AG movies. Probably truly more for the 8 and older crowd as there are bad guys in it. Love the message of friendship and acceptance of differences though.,1465862400,,226,4.82051282051282
7709966,5,B01D9TA4TK,The movie was great! I am a 14 year old and I have always enjoyed the AG movies. I really enjoyed this one. I highly recommend it.,1465862400,4,130,3.8518518518518516
7709967,1,B01D9TA4TK,"It seems that American Girl is so confident in its brand that it will release a movie this awful and still expect it to sell product.  The casting and acting are horrible.  The actor playing the older brother is particularly bad - and as one reviewer accurately wrote, ""creepy"" - making you wonder if he's the only one that auditioned for the role or is in some way related to the casting director.  The story line is weak, predictable and quickly begins to insult your intelligence.

I'm a father and have watched all of the American Girl movies with my daughters.  Clearly some of the movies are better than others.  I've watched a lot of poorly produced movies with my girls, but Lea to the Rescue produced a determination in me to 1) actually write a review about it; and, 2) not buy any product associated with this movie.",1465776000,30,827,4.516778523489933

7709969,2,B01D9TA4TK,"This movie had so much potential, but missed the mark by a lot. Lea comes across as self-centered, jealous, unemphatic, and without any understanding of consequences. The adults in this movie seem to merely shrug and mutter dismay, then and go along with whatever Lea wants, which includes tromping through the Amazon rainforest without appropriate clothing, footwear, food, or any other necessary supplies as well as actively chasing poachers/kidnappers without ever calling the police. Lea breaks global, well established childhood rules...1) Listen to adults, 2) Go to the police if there is a problem, 3) Be prepared, 4) Be safe and stay away from ""bad guys"". My 6 year old and I got into an argument about this movie at the end of it. I kept trying to explain that Lea was UNSAFE in so many situations, and her actions were INAPPROPRIATE for her age, not to mention her life was at risk throughout the ENTIRE movie. She argued right back that Lea did everything correctly. I am completely dismayed that this movie was released. I much prefer Grace and Isabel's movie.

The acting also came across as forced--and the brother also gave off a very creepy vibe that left me feeling quite unsettled during his scenes.",1465776000,49,1217,4.879227053140097
7709970,2,B01D9TA4TK,"This American Girl movie is just too unrealistic.  A child and a young woman going into the Amazon Rain Forest on their own, finding a tribe that speaks English, confronting thugs, give me a break!  The list of unrealistic danger facing goes on and on.  Plus, seeing the dead grandmother in the midst of the tribal dancing, which is never explained, as just Lea's imagination, could be very confusing and even frightening for children.  If your children see this movie, you'll need to see it with them and be ready to do a lot of explaining.
My granddaughters are obsessed with American Girl dolls and love all the movies.  They think I'm a very cool grandmother for having all of the movies for them to watch when they come over. However, they will not be seeing this one.  It is just way too over the top.",1465689600,26,807,4.493150684931507

8755277,1,B01D9TA4TK,"I've watched a few AG movies with my daughter and they're usually enjoyable; this one not so much.  What's supposed to be a brave young girl who rescues her brother comes across as mouthy, rebellious, and fool-hardy.  The adults are portrayed as oblivious at best and stupid at worst.  Movies are full of kids doing things they ought not to or grown ups being a little dense, but in my opinion this movie takes it too far.  Lea is disrespectful and does dangerous things that could have really hurt her, not behavior I'd want my daughter to emulate.",1533427200,,549,4.571428571428571
