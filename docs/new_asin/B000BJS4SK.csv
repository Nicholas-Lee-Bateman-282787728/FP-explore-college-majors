It is, however, a classic of the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema.  It features the young, trusting, Lupita from the rural village of Penjamo in Mexico.  At a festival in honor of the composer who has made it from Penjamo, she sings some of his songs.  She sings them poorly as she is untrained, however, the composer encourages her to pursue her dreams and she takes him at his word.  More so than he originally intended.  Taking him at his word, she ends up in Mexico City in his house and so begins the Mexican variation of the Pygmalion story.  Fernando Soler portrays the taskmaster composer who falls in love with Lupita (portrayed by Rosita Quintana), but feels he can't act upon his love because he is old enough to be her Grandfather.  Lupita doesn't seem to quite understand his reservations, but she does fall in-love with a young engineer.  The conflict being that the engineer wants her to give up her singing career.  So which one will she choose?  In the process we are treated to some beautiful Mexican songs and some beautiful traditional Mexican costumes and dances.  The movie is in Spanish without subtitles, so bear that in mind.  It is a good movie and a clean movie, I was unhappy about the ending, but I enjoyed the movie, nevertheless.",1411689600,3,1373,4.532520325203252
