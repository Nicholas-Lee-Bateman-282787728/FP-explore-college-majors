8267884,5,B0017ZCETM,"I ordered this title from Amazon in 2011, for I usually check out any movies that have Georgia Jones or Celeste Star in the cast. 2011 ""Penthouse"" Pet Georgia Jones has never disappointed me ... and her scenes in this video are her hottest ones, even beating ""Resort Tales"". Celeste Star is hot in some videos but less hot in others, and I'm in luck with this one that is just behind ""A Genie's Dream"" and ""Roller Booty"" for her hottest scenes. Georgia is in two scenes in this one, and both scenes are red hot. I observe that my opinion differs radically from that of the first reviewer. He says Shay Laren is the hottest gal in this video, but to me, she is very far behind Georgia and Celeste, so I never play her scenes in this video or any of my many other Peach videos in which she appears. The same can be said of Samantha Ryan. Sasha Hart is new to me, and I think she's better than Shay and Samanatha but far behind Georgia and Celeste. I think there's a good chance that any man will find some scenes that turn him on in this video, whether he prefers Shay, Georgia, Celeste, Samantha or Sasha ... so vive la difference (of opinions)! Both of us reviewers agree the movie is hot, so check it out! To me, it's a MUST HAVE!",1326758400,2,1231,4.220338983050848

I can't say enough good about Shay Laren, both in terms of her acting ability (and you get very very little scripted acting in this...whatever it is, not a movie exactly) and her smoking hot body.  But there just isn't much here other than her. There are four other girls but none of them is really hot and one appears only briefly in the final vignette.

They do all show quite a bit and that's why I'm giving this four stars, but it's perilously close to being three. The vignettes are too long and dull. Pacing tends to be a strength of most of the older Peach releases but this thing feels tired in places and I even found myself fast forwarding as much as watching at the correct speed.

I've decided that I'm just not a fan of this direction that Peach has taken in an effort (so is my theory) to combat the success of the Actiongirls releases, which also aren't exactly movies. The older Peach formula, with far more women and far shorter vignettes, works much better.",1283817600,3,1078,4.375
