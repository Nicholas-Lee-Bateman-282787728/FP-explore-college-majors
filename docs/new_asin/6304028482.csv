7860253,3,6304028482,"One of the quieter storlines going through most of the NG seven year run  is LaForge's lack of success with women.  It seems that the only place he  can find a good woman that likes him is on the holodeck.
This is when he  met the beautiful Ms. Brahms.  He had used an image of her on the holodeck  in an earlier episode to help him with a technical problem.  He gave her a  warm personality which suited his desires.
In this episode he finally  meets her.  But she is somewhat cold and distant, and he soon learns she is  married, which naturally crushes him.
He is humiliated when she discovers  the saved program that Geordi created.  The storyline that accompanies it  is somewhat interesting, and some would say uplifting.
I would give this  episode 4 stars, but 3 is a better fit.  It just seems to miss something  that the series is so rich in.  But if you are a Geordi LaForge fan, this  is a must-have episode.",962668800,3,919,4.331360946745562
