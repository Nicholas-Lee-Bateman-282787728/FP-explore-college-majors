2499408,1,B000E6ESF8,"The screen career of the beloved LAUREL & HARDY went downhill...and downhill fast when they left the auspices of producer Hal Roach, for whom they had worked for over 14 years.

Their first films away from Roach were made by 20th Century-Fox, and (with one exception) these films have long been acknowledged by L&H devotees as pathetic and depressing. Fox did not know what to do with them, and the writing, pacing & timing that was the hallmark of their genius was sorely missed.

For the casual Laurel and Hardy fan, this set is a must to avoid, because there is very little to laugh at. For die-hard completists who want every film they ever made released on DVD, this will be a likely purchase.

It is to Fox's credit that they did include JITTERBURGS here, because that is the most tolerable of the films that L&H made at Fox. Vivian Blaine's charm, and a better script make the film almost as entertaining as L&H's lesser Roach features, but that's not saying much.

THE BIG NOISE may possibly be the worst film they ever made.

Sadly, most of L&H's best material is owned by Hallmark Entertainment, who have treated their boys' legacy shabbily with poorly packaged, terribly mastered releases that don't do their great Hal Roach films justice. Hallmark doesn't own the Roach films in Europe, where beautiful masters and loving care have been brought to their material.

But there is hope. A mere week after this lackluster Fox release arrives, a classy release from TCM via Warner Bros. salutes Stan & Ollie with remastered versions of two of their finest features, THE DEVIL'S BROTHER and BONNIE SCOTLAND, plus several excerpts from other films, and a delightful feature-length documentary about the history of short subjects that I've seen before on TCM that is loaded with Hal Roach and L&H clips. THAT'S the one to buy.....until Hallmark gets their act together, or even after Hallmark gets their act together, if such a thing ever happens.

Meanwhile, regardless of the fact that Fox's Laurel & Hardy films are as bad as they are, their issue on DVD is certainly going to make their hardcore fans happy, and there's nothing wrong with that...as long as buyers are aware the films are far from resembling what made Laurel & Hardy the screen's greatest comedy duo.",1139184000,80,2274,4.8005115089514065
2499409,4,B000E6ESF8,"While I am OVERJOYED that the Fox/Laurel & Hardy films are getting a release (although, I dislike GREAT GUNS - and like JITTERBUGS and THE BIG NOISE) PLEASE don't forget to release a SECOND VOLUME DVD with their OTHER three Fox features (A-HAUNTING WE WILL GO and THE DANCING MASTERS which are both great fun and THE BULLFIGHTERS, their last Hollywood film.)",1138320000,6,358,4.790322580645161
2499410,4,B000E6ESF8,"After Laurel and Hardy left Hal Roach studios in 1940, they signed with 20th Century Fox. Over the next four years they made six films for Fox, and two more for MGM. Many consider this period in their careers to be their worst. Laurel and Hardy had no control over the films during this period. However, the films deserve a second look. Some of the films are entertaining, and much better then the garbage called comedy these days. In this set are three Fox films:

Great Guns. From 1941, the boys are valets to a young man who gets drafted into the army. Stan and Ollie enlist so they can be with him. The young man proves to be good soldier, and Laurel and Hardy get stuck with a tough sargent. The story was weak, but there are some funny bits.

Jitterbugs. From 1943, the boys are zoot suited musisicans who get involved with con artists. They go undercover to make things right. The best film from this period, Laurel and Hardy perform their roles well. Ollie gets to impersonate a southern Colonel in a great scene with Lee Patrick (You will remember her from the Maltese Falcon) and Stan plays in drag. Vivian Blane also appears in one of her first films.

The Big Noise. From 1944, this was listed in the book, The Fify Worst Films of all Time. That is a list that needs updating badly. Not a great film, it does have its moments. The boys are janitors at a detective agency. An inventor of a new kind of bomb calls the agency to help gaurd the bomb. Stan and Ollie impersonate detectives to get the job. Some classic bits from early films are here, such as Ollie climing a post to see a street sign, only to see a wet paint sign, the passing the hat routine, and a funny recreation of the upper berth scene from Berth Marks, with comic drunk Jack Norton. A side note about this scene, when Jack Norton asks if he can smoke, Ollie replies, I don't care if you burn up! This bit was used in the Honeymooners episode Unconvential Behavior. Also watch for future murder defendant Robert Blake as a bratty kid.

On September 12, Fox will release The Bullfighters, Dancing Masters, and A-Haunting we will go in a three DVD set.",1138060800,12,2130,4.398477157360406
2499411,5,B000E6ESF8,"Fox is releasing three of its Laurel & Hardy features on DVD: GREAT GUNS (1941), JITTERBUGS (1943), and THE BIG NOISE (1944). These are among the team's later works, and Laurel & Hardy collectors and completists should welcome this boxed set.

GREAT GUNS is Fox's topical answer to Abbott & Costello's hit ""Buck Privates,"" with awkward rookies Stan and Ollie in the army. The script is rather lame, but there are some choice moments (you'll howl when Laurel stashes a live crow down Hardy's pants during inspection). Watch for Alan Ladd in a bit part.

JITTERBUGS is an engaging comedy with music, with Stan and Ollie as zoot-suited bandleaders who get mixed up with swindlers, and who right the wrong by adopting disguises for a sting operation. Vivian Blaine sings three songs, radio actor Bob Bailey is fine as the stingmaster, and Stan and Ollie are in good form (and fun to watch when they're in disguise). This is the glossiest Laurel & Hardy movie from this period, with a notable supporting cast.

THE BIG NOISE is a matter of taste. Some viewers regard it as merely a humdrum rehash of old routines, while others enjoy it as a virtual textbook of tried-and-true Laurel & Hardy material. Either way, it's loaded with vintage gags. The boys are janitors-turned-detectives, who safeguard a gadget-crazy inventor and his new high explosive. Watch for young Robert Blake as a mischievous brat. First-time viewers should enjoy it; if you know Laurel & Hardy you'll certainly recognize the jokes: an upper-berth scene with drunken Jack Norton is a highlight.

This DVD set also includes bonus material, including vintage coming-attractions trailers, and audio commentaries by author Randy Skretvedt. A special treat is REVENGE OF THE SONS OF THE DESERT, Alexander Marshall's Emmy-winning featurette about the international Laurel & Hardy society (founded by L & H biographer John McCabe).

Picture and sound quality in these DVDs should be excellent, based on the studio's former VHS releases in this series.",1137628800,57,2010,5.0604229607250755

2499499,2,B000E6ESF8,"Laurel and Hardy's quality work died when they left Hal Roach Studios. Their best work was made between 1927-1935, mostly 20 to 30 minute shorts, for Hal Roach Studios. These movies, made by 20th Century Fox in the 1940s, are an embarrassment. Stan Laurel, the mastermind behind their earlier films, was not allowed to help in the writing process, and the writers have no understanding what-so-ever of what made L&H so great. They are treated like morons, when they were always more like innocent, clueless (and sometimes violent) children. Stan HATED these movies, and for good reason - they are AWFUL. The only mildly amusing scenes in these films are pale imitations of bits from their earlier films. For QUALITY L&H look for their shorts made from 1927-34 OR the movies ""Sons of the Desert"" and ""Way Out West"". Unfortunately, due to a copyright battle, their best work is not currently available on DVD in the U.S. If you have the money, buy the British COMPLETE L&H DVD boxed set and an all-regions DVD player.",1297555200,2,1015,4.805714285714286
2499500,4,B000E6ESF8,"Having been a huge fan of Laurel & Hardy for over 30 years now, I have always avoided their later films with Fox and MGM like the plague.  All I ever read was how awful they were, and how they were a poor reflection of the team's glory days at the Hal Roach Studios.

I finally decided to bite the bullet and purchase this set to see for myself, and I'm happy to say it was a wise decision!  It's true that the three films in this set, plus the three in the second set, are not The Boys' best work, but neither are they the travesties that many authors paint them.

""Great Guns"", their first post-HRS film, is the weakest in this group.  It has some good moments, but as Randy Skretvedt's audio commentary notes, the one-liners and snappy comebacks were better suited for Abbott & Costello than the more visual comedy that was L&H's trademark.

""Jitterbugs"" offers up more typical L&H routines, a durable storyline, and the beautiful Vivian Blaine.  That's good enough for me!

""The Big Noise"" is often assailed as being the worst of their films with Fox, even by Mr. Skretvedt in his excellent book, ""Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies"".  But as he admits in his audio commentary, this film contains some great classic L&H routines, and on reassessment, he actually considers this one of their better post-Roach films.

All three films have received an excellent restoration.  Randy Skretvedt's audio commentary on all three films is interesting and insightful, and definitely worth listening to on a second viewing.  Other extras include a documentary on a convention of the Laurel & Hardy fan club, Sons of the Desert, newsreels, trailers, and photos.

I definitely recommend this set for any Laurel & Hardy fan!",1227657600,2,1726,4.713333333333333
2499501,4,B000E6ESF8,"I'll start off by saying ""Great Guns"" and ""The Big Noise"" are pretty bad movies.  Any comedy actor of the day could have been the stars of these movies and lord knows these movies would not be available on dvd today. But, Hey, it's still Stan and Ollie.  Most every Actor-Actress goes downhill late in their career. Did you see Bette Davis in ""Return from Witch Mountain"".  That was a Terrible Boring Movie.  Why was she even in it?  Let alone so was Christopher Lee.  My point is that not everyone buys Movies(dvd's) just for the sake of :Is It a good movie or not?!?  I bought this set knowing what these movies were all about.  I'm glad they were cleaned up looking and sounding good and above all... They all had commentary by Randy Skretvedt.  Anything L@H is worth getting especially if you are a true fan of their decades of acting.",1207267200,3,839,4.431372549019608
2499502,4,B000E6ESF8,"The saga of Laurel & Hardy's post-Hal Roach years as they fell in line at Twentieth-Century Fox (and did their best to entertain during WWII) is finally chronicled here in this trio of films. The offering is a mixed bag, demonstrating the difficulties the boys had in their transition, ranging from good (""Jitterbugs"") to mediocre (""Great Guns"") to poor (""The Big Noise"").
Behind the cameras, the boys were not allowed to tamper with the scripts (similar to Buster Keaton's fate when he signed on at MGM). Stan, curiously, was not allowed to use his traditional clown-white makeup (which would've helped to make him look younger). What's worse, they were being humbled onscreen by the white-hot new comedy team of Abbott & Costello, whose antics, in comparison, seemed funnier & fresher than the often-pale material Stan & Ollie were given. And the release dates didn't help the situation either: ""Great Guns"" premiered months after A&C's smash debut ""Buck Privates"", ""A-Haunting We Will Go"" trailed behind ""Hold That Ghost"", and so on...all with similar themes & storylines.
This is not to say that Stan & Ollie didn't score laughs onscreen. ""Great Guns"", a typical service comedy, has it's magical moments: Stan shaving by the light of a bulb screwed into his mouth; a wild jeep ride as sacks of flour are dumped on them; and hiding behind a wagon used as target practice. But too much of it seemed mechanical, obvious stuff. It's a pleasant comedy that could've been better with stronger material. ""Jitterbugs"" is, by far, the best of their 1940's features. A breezy, clever comedy that gives the boys great comic opportunities to clown as travelling zoot-suited musicians who team up with a likeable con man to put the sting on some other cons who have swindled a singer's mother out of her fortune. It even overrides the boys' advancing ages by taking delightful turns in disguises: Hardy as a wealthy Texas gent, and Laurel as a fussy spinster. It will keep you laughing from start to finish. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for ""The Big Noise"", a comedy which probably looked zany & fun on paper, but turned out a strange mess onscreen. Even its offbeat plot is astonishingly dry of genuine laughs as the boys pose as detectives to guard a powerful bomb created by an eccentric inventor. Too much plot ""padding"" (the boys always did better with minimal plot), sparse comedy routines, and secondary use of the team make this one possibly the worst of ALL their features, including their 1950 swan song ""Utopia"".
All-in-all, in spite of the inconsistent content, a worthwhile DVD package to watch, thanks mainly to the inclusion of the delightful ""Jitterbugs"".",1197244800,5,2673,4.942222222222222
2499503,3,B000E6ESF8,"Just about any Laurel & Hardy biography or film book had the same opinion. ""Blockheads"" was the teams last great movie. Then the team was temporally split up with Laurel going off to produce B westerns and Hardy getting the lead role in ""Zenobia"". This was the dividing mark in their career. They re-teamed but the films their following films ""A Chump At Oxford"", ""Flying Deuces"" and ""Saps At Sea"" were all pretty weak. Then the Laurel and Hardy left Hal Roach for a contract at 20th Century Fox to make a series of movies and Fox executives sabotaged the team ( perhaps deliberately ) with bad movies that gradually grew worse until they hit rock bottom with ""The Bullfighters"". The boys also made a couple of movies for MGM studios but did no better as that studio had no idea how to make comedies. After a five year hiatus from movies the team returned to redeem themselves in the film ""Atoll K"" which was far superior to the Fox movies in plot but was hurt by Stan Laurels medical condition at the time of filming as well as the language barrier between cast members and crew. Another agreement was that ""Jitterbugs"" was the one good film to be made at the time but was nowhere as good at the teams weakest Roach movie, and another was that ""The Big Bang"" was the worst Laurel and Hardy movie ever made. Since the Fox and MGM movies were rarely shown on television and by the 90's had been out of circulation for decades there was no way for anyone other than film historians to make this evaluation. For the rest of us the only available Laurel & Hardy movies was ""Flying Deuces"" which was public domain and therefore shown many times on television,  and ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" which returned every year around Thanksgiving and/or near Christmas. Also about every five years Hal Roach would temporarily release several of his Laurel & Hardy movies to syndication and had allowed Blackhawk Films to release them to the home theater market. When VHS became a factor in the 80's Nostalgia Merchant, Video Treasures, and Cabin Fever videos released most of the Hal Roach sound movies while ""Atoll K"" which was public domain was released by just about every cheap home video company under it's American release title ""Utopia"". From what we saw ""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"" was a great film as the other Roach movies were of about equal quality, ""Flying Deuces"" was weak compared with those movies, and ""Utopia"" was weaker than ""Flying Deuces"" and disturbing. There seemed to be merit in the story that the Fox films were crap.

But then in 1992 MGM/UA decided to release the Laurel & Hardy movies they owned the rights to onto the home video sales market.  Previously they had made ""Bonnie Scotland"" available to video rental shops or anyone else willing to pay $90 for a VHS tape. CBS/FOX had released ""Great Guns"" and ""The Bull Fighters"" to the rental shop market as well. The high price of these videos kept them out of most video retail stores and very few rental shops bought them for their nostalgia sections as ""Flying Deuces"" and ""Utopia"" were available for $10. With ""Devil's Brother"" and ""Bonnie Scotland"" now mass produced and available for under $20 MGM/UA had a hit on their hands and quickly dug into their vaults for any other Laurel and Hardy movies they owned the rights to. They came up with ""Hollywood Party"", ""Pick A Star"", and the Robert Youngson compilation ""Laurel & Hardy's Laughing 20's"". And then there was ""Air Raid Wardens"" and ""Nothing But Trouble"" which were released a year later. For the first time the mass public had the chance in decades to evaluate the Fox era movies for themselves. I myself a Laurel & Hardy fan bought them out of curiosity and was surprised to see that they were not the horrible train wrecks that they had been made out to be. Perhaps it was the Fox movies that were crap? But then in 1995 Fox released ""The Big Noise"" to the home market. That movie was reputed to be their worse, so imagine my surprise when I found many parts of the movie funny. The truth is that the post Roach movies are not bad at all. Sure they do not live up to the quality of the teams past movies, but they do stand up to almost anything Abbot and Costello or any other comedians were releasing at the same time. They were the style of comedies that were being made in the 1940's, a time when these movies were filled with gangsters and Nazi spies no matter what studio you worked for. It is what the audiences wanted at that time.

Part of the reason why the later films get such a bad rap is because of the cult of Hal Roach. We are all lead to believe that Roach could do no wrong and if only Laurel and Hardy had stayed at that studio then they would have been making great comedies well into the 1950's. Leaving Roach was suppose to be their worst decision ever. This is far from true. Roach Studios did have an advantage over the other Hollywood studios during the 1920's and 30's as the comedians were given the freedom to craft their own movies. But that freedom began to erode towards the end of the 30's. Roach was phasing out shorts and was going into feature films. This meant more of an investment per picture and therefore Roach was increasingly taking a more hands on approach to each movie to protect his investments. ""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"" may have become an all time classic, but it was forced on Laurel & Hardy who would have rather been doing a different movie ate that time. More and more their movies were filled with romantic B plots with two other characters. ""Blockheads"" was just a fluke, a film that Roach had given Laurel full creative control over because it was only being made on the cheap to satisfy some contractual obligations that the studio had with Bank of America. The bank was giving Roach studios a loan, but since the papers were filled with rumors that Stan Laurel was ready to quit and break up the comedy team the bank refused to approve the loan unless they saw that another Laurel & hardy movie was in production and being filmed. Roach and Laurel had an agreement that the team start production on a movie immediately and once the bank approved the loan the movie would be abandoned and the team would go back to writing the pirate movie they were originally developing. Laurel ended up completing half of ""Blockheads"" and Roach decided to allow him to complete it and release it as a feature. Taking a look at the prior Laurel & Hardy movie ""Swiss Miss"" you can plainly see that the Roach movies were starting to go downhill with unnecessary musical numbers and romantic subplots. When Laurel returned to the studio in 1939 it was under the agreement that they would do streamliners which were 40 minute movies that were short enough to release as B features but long enough not to be shorts. Both movies were 20 minute plots padded out to 40 minutes, and Roach would later ask the boys to film 20 more minutes of footage for each movie so they could be lengthened to features. This explains their poor pacing compared to the previous movies. It is all possible that if Laurel had agreed to a team contract with Roach that they still would have made forced into making their own version of ""Buck Privates"" as they would later do at Fox. And lets not forget that Laurel always had the opportunity to resign with Roach to do any movies. The fact that he did not and continued doing movies for Fox and MGM indicated that he would no longer have the artistic freedom at that studio that Roach had given them in the past.

But most of the blame for the poor reputation the Fox era films got was from John McCabe. He was the teams personal biographer and had gotten the impression from comments made by Stan Laurel that the Fox moves were terrible and just got worse with each film. However, it is more likely that Stan was talking about working conditions and studio relations rather than film quality. When Everson released his filmography book ""The Complete Films of Laurel & Hardy"" he wrote as little as possible on the post Roach movies. The synopsis of each was reduced to as few sentences as possible and the commentary of each was no more than a paragraph which usually commented on how tragic it was that the quality was dropping off with each movie ( Everson's personal opinion ). This would continue in other books including Randy Skretvedt's ""Laurel & Hardy: The Magic Behind The Movies"" as well as being picked apart in Glenn Mitchell's ""Laurel & Hardy Encyclopedia"". In recent years film historians have begone to take a fresh look at the post Roach movies and are now realizing that they were still good efforts by Laurel and Hardy. For the most part they all had enough good moments to qualify them as comedies and compared to what has passed for comedies since the 1930's especially with current movies they all have more than enough laughs. No they do not have the wall to wall humor that the Roach films had but they are not the garbage that they have been made out to be. And for the most part the 1940's audiences loved these films and they did extremely well at the box office. In other words Laurel & Hardy did leave Hollywood as a success in the eyes of the public. Only the film historians who had access to all of their work, and in the 1950's could compare their 40's films with those from the 20's and 30's, only they knew that the later films were of less quality. For the general public the memory of ""Blockheads"" faded before ""Flying Deuces"" came out, and the memory of ""Saps At Sea"" faded before ""Great Guns"" came out. There was no television or home video. For all they knew each new Fox movie was as good as all the other Laurel and Hardy movies. Today's Laurel & Hardy fan has access to every one of their films with exception to ""Rouges Song"" and ""Hats Off"" and a complete version of ""Battle Of The Century"". Their DVD collection has every silent short, every Roach sound film ( from overseas unfortunately as Hallmark has not yet released a proper DVD collection in the United States ) and now can own all their 1940's films as both Fox and Warner Brothers are releasing them on DVD. ( they may have to fill their collection with some old and likely used VHS releases, but you get the picture. ) For the first tie we all can watch any Laurel and Hardy film at any time we want, and have the ability to compare for ourselves. In my opinion the later films are weaker than the Roach sound films, but that is like saying that I am weaker than the current Olympic heavy weight lifting champion. Generally I am not a weakling, but I and nearly everyone else reading it could never lift 500 pounds. Similarly the Fox and MGM movies cold never compare to most of the Roach movies. But is it fair to even judge them by comparison? Laurel and Hardy did perform well in their later movies. I would say they make a good introduction to the team for new viewers leading into their masterpieces at Roach a little later ( why not save the best for last? ). Newbies to the team will enjoy most of these movies and then will be in for a complete surprise when they see the earlier films. As for the rest of us who know better, this completes our video collection and despite what any of you may think about the later films they can still make you smile and occasionally break out in laughter, and that is still worth something.

For Fox's first box set they decided to start with the post Hal Roach movie with the reputation of being the best ( or closest to the quality of their past movies ) and combine it with what had the reputation of being the worst. ""THE BIG NOISE"" even has the dubious honor of turning up on many all time worst movie lists along with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Robot Monster"", ""Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes"",  and ""Terror Of Tiny Town"" among others. However in recent years with Fox releasing the movie on VHS and being made widely available for the first time in decades the film has picked up a reputation of being a lost classic and nearly equal to the teams work at Roach Studios. After viewing the film both during it's original VHS release and this recent DVD release I can say that it's bad reputation is unjustified. While not as well crafted as the Roach comedies it never the less has plenty of funny scenes including one that is a reworking of their short ""Berth Marks"" that actually improves with a better angle and the addition of a drunk who winds up sharing the berth. One gets the feeling that all the Fox and MGM movies were lumped together and one was randomly picked out as the worst. Perhaps it was the movies title that had it picked out over the others. The plot itself is pretty sound. A scientist has invented a bomb capable of destroying an entire city and worried that spies will try to steal it calls a detective agency asking for men to guard it. But janitors Laurel and Hardy are the only ones at the agency and decide to take the case themselves. As it turns out there is a gang of burglars living next door looking to steal valuables from the scientist and overhearing that he has the bomb decide to steal that instead. Laurel & Hardy manage to foil their plans and then lead the crooks on a cross country chase as the boys try to bring the bomb to the secretary of defense in Washington DC. The only true bad joke is when for no exact reason the matriarch of the home the boys are guarding tells Hardy that he reminds her of Romeo and for a few seconds we fade in to see Hardy in a Romeo costume. This joke is brief and fortunately most of the rest were lifted from past Laurel & Hardy movies. This is perhaps the only real complaint anyone could have about this movie; how most if not all the gags were directly lifted from past Laurel & Hardy films including ""Do Detectives Think"", ""Habeas Corpus"", ""Berth Marks"", ""Oliver the 8th"", and even a little ""Flying Deuces"". But on the plus side the romantic subplot is barely existent. In fact the scientist and the girl he has fallen for are abandoned a good half hour before the movie's end. The DVD's extras include commentary by Randy Skretvedt, interesting as in the past he has had nothing good to say about the Fox movies, but by the time this box set had been released had a change of heart and was admitting that the Fox films were worth watching. My only complaint is that Mr. Skretvedt spends way too much time in his commentaries giving the resumes of every actor and crew member involved with the movie instead of commenting on what is taking place on the screen. One example happens on the ""Great Guns"" disk where he does not get around to pointing out why Laurel and Hardy have entered a room disheveled because he is too busy commenting on the film career of one of the bit actors in the same scene. All the discs also include photo galleries which have very few production photos and lots of newspaper ads.  The other extras on this disc included the trailer for the movie and the documentary ""Revenge Of The Sons Of The Desert"" which has nothing to do with this movie or Fox studios, and is an odd addition considering that at the time this documentary was made the Sons Of The Desert were almost unanimous in the belief that Laurel & hardy should have never made the Fox films to begin with.

""GREAT GUNS"" was the first movie the team made at Fox and in effect was the studio's attempt to do their own version of Abbot & Costello's ""Buck Privates"". Laurel and Hardy are the servants of the films romantic lead. When he is drafted Laurel & Hardy decide to enlist themselves in order to watch over him. Just as in ""Buck Privates"" the movie concludes with a war game. Out of all the post Roach movies this has to be the most inappropriate when it comes to the Laurel and Hardy characters. Not only has screenwriter Lou Breslow failed to capture the screen characters of Laurel & Hardy but has also failed to capture the screen characters of Abbot & Costello which was the whole point of this picture. Instead we get Laurel & Hardy acting more stupid than any character had before in motion picture history ( with possible exception to The Three Stooges ). One example being where it takes both of them a couple of minutes to figure out that they are being shot at while lying behind a target. In past films Hardy would have figured this out after a few seconds while Laurel would have taken a few seconds more. They certainly would have not spent a couple of minutes wondering what kind of woodpecker the machine gun sound was coming from. Fortunately Laurel was able to shoehorn in a few of his own original jokes such as a white magic routine where he unscrews a light bulb and keeps it lit. And the movie does manage to have a few legitimate laugh out loud gags which I will not mention here as they would only act as spoilers. The extras on this disc include another commentary track by Randy Skretvedt, the film's trailer, a photo gallery, and a Fox Newsreel of the opening of the Freemont Theater which laurel & Hardy attended.

""JITTERBUGS"" has the reputation of being the only good post Hal Roach movie with Laurel & Hardy. The reason for this opinion started in 1943. After two movies that were direct rip offs of Abbot & Costello films Fox was finally giving the boys something original. Furthermore since the movie was also going to be a showcase to introduce their new star Vivian Blaine the studio gave the movie a huge budget. At the time reviewers were not fond of Laurel & Hardy so they would be judging their movies on originality and production values. ""Jitterbugs"" would have garnered better reviews than usual. In addition to this Oliver Hardy had fond memories of this movie and told biographer John McCabe that it was one of his best. This was probably due to the fact that it was one of the few movies that gave Hardy a chance to act outside his Ollie character. A combinations of better than usual reviews and Oliver Hardy's endorsement convinced McCabe that ""Jitterbugs"" was the only decent post Roach movies the duo made, and it soon became lore in their official biography. The film further gained importance three decades later when it began to be compared to ""The Sting"". The plot of the movie has Laurel & Hardy hooking up with a conman selling fake gas pills. The conman falls for Vivian Blaine and finding out that she herself was a victim of another conman decides to help get her money back. The plan is to enlist the aid of Laurel and Hardy and con the con men who took Blaine's money. While this is a good movie, it is not exactly a proper Laurel and Hardy film. While the first ten minutes seem more like their classic movies, the rest has them impersonating other characters with only a few moments where they revert back to their screen characters. ( I like to compare this movie to the holiday special ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" where Magoo is only in character for the first five minutes and as Ebenezer Scrooge for the rest of the show. ) And as for comparing this movie to ""The Sting"", without giving much away, there are two consecutive cons pulled of in this movie and in both instances the marks figure the con out almost immediately, unlike in ""The Sting""  where everyone including the audience do not realize the con has taken place. This is a good film and Laurel and Hardy are good in it, but it is hardly a Laurel and Hardy movie, and in my opinion it is definitely not the best of the Fox films. Extras include commentary by Randy Sketvedt, a photo gallery, the film's trailer, and an odd piece of footage of Laurel and Hardy at a ribbon cutting ceremony of a railroad, odd because it is the raw footage without the music or voice overs added yet for the newsreel.",1192665600,8,19658,4.4699331848552335

When I purchased the 21 dvd box set ""Laurel&Hardy Collection"" two years ago, I thought that almost all of the movies were included in this collection. Eventually, I realized that most of the movies from 1940s and some of the 1930s movies were not considered in this collection. Fortunately, I came across this new collection of their films which were missing in the 21 dvd collection. The three movies in ""Laurel&Hardy Giftset Volume 1"" are the movies made in 1940s. Though they seem a bit aged(Laurel) in some particular scenes, they still do a fantastic job. I think every Laurel&Hardy fun or simply the fun of classical comedies should get this ""Laurel&Hardy giftset"". ""Laurel&Hardy Giftset Volume 2"" has already come out and I also recommend you to get that one too. Great!

2499550,1,B000E6ESF8,"As a life-long fan of Stan and Ollie, I continue to be depressed at the relative absence of the availability of their classic works on DVD. Except for the thrown-together Hallmark volumes which , for the most part, use poor dupes of 35mm material and for Turner's L&H ""collection"" with FRA DIAVOLO and BONNIE SCOTLAND, two of their weakest Roach films, their is nothing readily available to show the genius of these two timeless performers. The continued release of the weak - and frequently execrable - films for Fox and MGM in the 40s will only cause the unititiated to think L&H are nothing beyond two aging, unfunny knockabouts.

Although the Fox/MGM films might have a place on the shelf of a completist, they are really just depressing. Why does not UNIVERSAL, who releases the ENTIRE body of their Roach work from 1927 -1940 release this massive and impressive set state-side?",1162598400,10,883,4.847682119205298
2499551,4,B000E6ESF8,"It seems like so many people have said that L&H's post-1940 films are awful for so long that even people who don't have any familiarity with them believe it, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Sure they'll never compare to their earlier glories like 'Pack Up Your Troubles' or 'Way Out West,' nor to any of their short subjects, but they really shouldn't be compared because they're in two very different categories.  People should see them as what they are, not what they're not.  And wouldn't one rather see L&H in a less brilliant vehicle than see the kind of stuff that passes for comedy today?

'Great Guns' (1941) can feel like a big let-down, since this was their first Fox film after so many wonderful years at Hal Roach, and the drop-off in quality is stunning.  However, it does manage to deliver enough funny lines and gags to make this picture worthwhile.  It may not be as funny or as classic as their earlier glories, but it's still entertaining regardless.  Great scenes include Stan and Ollie's attempts to serve themselves lunch at the dining hall, Stan stuffing their pet crow down the back of Ollie's pants when they're in formation, and the neverending plank of wood Stan carries during one of their military exercises.  Though this film was made somewhat prior to the U.S. entering WWII, it does seem to be anticipating that possibility, what with the ""Isn't the Army great and fun?"" theme, kind of making it into a subtle propaganda picture in case the U.S. really did join the war.  And it's painful to see how Fox just didn't understand Stan and Ollie's characters, making them aware of their dumbness, servile, not wanting to better themselves and rise above being servants, people who know their place and don't mind it.  Stan's stupidity and Ollie's weight are made into cruel needless joke after cruel needless joke as well.  Before, part of the joke was that Ollie was quite a big boy, but that he was so graceful in spite of it, and that Stan was in a special childlike world of his own, which Ollie often brought him out of with a choice word or look.  They're also kind of pushed into the background in favor of the boring would-be couple, more like supporting characters.  There's also a badly dated scene where Sgt. Hippo (whom I thought looked like Bob Hope) has his face blackened by exploding tobacco, and Stan and Ollie pretend to not recognise him, with lines like ""Look, they've assigned us a porter.""  Then their commanding officer comes in and yells at Hippo, asking him, ""What are you trying to do, put on a minstrel show?""  They never would have used this kind of cheap racial humor at Hal Roach!

'Jitterbugs' (1943) also has secondary characters assuming more importance in the plotline, though Stan and Ollie seem more their old selves in this picture, getting to have more of the main action instead of being pushed to the sideline in favor of some boring young couple and the villains, coupled with superfluous musical numbers (rather like what happened to the Marx Brothers in their MGM films).  It's also a lot funnier than 'Great Guns.'  Added bonuses are the scene where Ollie has to pretend to be a Southern colonel (he does it so well and convincingly, doubtlessly because he was a Southerner himself) and the scenes where Stan pretends to be Emily Cartwright.  It's always a riot to see Stan in drag, and he also gets to use his real British accent, which is an added bonus.  Probably one of their best Fox films, even though it might not be quite up to their old snuff.

'The Big Noise' (1944) suffers from being uneven.  A lot of the best scenes and gags are remakes of things from earlier shorts and features (such as 'Oliver the Eighth,' 'Berth Marks,' 'Habeas Corpus,' and 'Wrong Again!'), but they never really go anywhere.  The plot had a lot of potential, but just wasn't executed very well.  It also suffers from, once again, secondary characters assuming too much importance.  And the ending just occurs out of nowhere and leaves more questions than answers; additionally, Stan and Ollie would have never dropped a bomb on anyone on purpose, even in wartime, back at Hal Roach.  They just weren't that type of people.  Of their WWII-themed films, I actually much prefer the also-reviled 'Air Raid Wardens.'  However, I don't think this film is as awful as its reputation; it's certainly not what I'd consider their worst feature.

Extras include trailers, audio commentaries, photo galleries and press materials, newsreels about Fox Movietone News, and a short documentary on the Sons of the Desert, the worldwide L&H fan society.  Overall, this isn't something I'd recommend to a new or casual fan, but it's a must-have for more seasoned fans.  These films are better than their reputation (one should form one's own opinion about them instead of just parroting the popular wisdom; that's like letting other people do your thinking for you), and it's great to see that they've been given the deluxe treatment, restored, and released on DVD.  Hopefully people with open minds will be able to make up their own minds about their merit and worth, even to consider a critical re-evaluation of them.",1160611200,11,5164,4.773903262092238

2499553,3,B000E6ESF8,"I purchased this three-CD set for the Documentary feature and found it far less fun than the three later-career films which fans and historians have referred to with disfavor.
Yes, these 1940s comedies should have been much better - and it is sad to watch so many opportunities for characteristic stuff fall heavily by the wayside because of presumptive, yet well-documented restrictions on the creativity. In The Big Noise, for example, an unrealized situation occurs when the boys are working as Janitors assigned to a Detective agency. A call comes in for the employment of a couple of protective workers. Hardy picks up the phone and struggles to converse with the caller because Laurel is running the vacuum cleaner. Here is the chance for Ollie's mis-interpretation that Janitors are being hired to guard a weapon - the machine drowns out the caller. But, no, they're studying to *be* Detectives, so it sounds interesting. Bobby Blake plays the mischievous son of an eccentric inventor. There's an opportunity for him to switch the real with the fake bomb, which would have made a fun wind-up when the elated pair who successfully employed the weapon in an actual war situation, realize what the kid did - and chase him into a nice fadeout.
Another lost chance occurs in Jitterbugs: Ollie is the leader of a ""mechanical"" two-man band (including a certain gentleman from overseas); they meet with Vivian Blaine who is a great young singer. Later in the script she manages to convince a reluctant nightclub owner that she should audition.  Here was the obvious opening for her say to say that she can even bring along her own musical support - Laurel and Hardy! The lively opening sequence with the ""Jitterbug"" duo has absolutely no follow-up. Later on Laurel is given a chance to pose as Blaine's ""Aunt Emily"" so as to win back 10k from swindlers. Hardy, himself dressed as ""Colonel Bixby""(!), must coach Laurel in the art of feminine walking. He demonstrates in the hotel room. At the end of the display, a third party enters the scene. Why not have the guy walk in on this bizarre scene? Hardy's reaction would have been hilarious.
The Big Noise is one of three 20th Century Fox movies included and thanks to a pristine transfer and a great feature with noted author Randy Skretvedt, a running commentary mixing the history of Laurel and Hardy with the flow of the movie. This picture remains more infamous than famous among fans, but Randy brilliantly points out subtleties of production, costuming, and pantomine, which cause the viewer to reconsider the film as a whole. This effort features alot of L & H in often respectable bits which nullify the bad reputation.
We are *guided* by this authoritative writer through the three comedies, and we are easily convinced that these efforts thought of as pretty bad now seem not so bad - we are, after all, watching perhaps the most influential comedy actors of all time, so the enjoyment includes the viewer's opinion on where they manage slip in those ""Laurel-and-Hardy-isms."" Especially in The Big Noise and Jitterbugs (a film they appeared to enjoy making), like great singers who can make weak material into something compelling, they transform the proceedings by their own gifts of great timing and reaction.
Speaking again of lost chances, the commentary should have extended to a disgraceful scene in Great Guns, involving some racial ""humor"" so typical of the period. Ofcourse, films of the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and others, contained  material involving ethnic stereotyping, but the depressing business mentioned above should not be accepted simply as an unfortunate history lesson. Not to suggest that the producers and contributors to this package would not recognize the insulting bit of business, but just as in professional sports, movie making has some explaining to do, historically speaking.
This film is better than most of the post-Roaches but typically has many scenes which are very misguided. The script and situation may be sporadically okay but the Director does not understand the characters or their teamwork: early in the film, the Boys are at mess (no, Stan did not say ""this is a nice Mess"" to which Ollie delivers a camera-look). Laurel, in line, asks the attendant, [if his drink is] ""Sanka?"" The attendant says ""You're welcome"". Obviously, Stan's line. Should have been: (he hands Stan a coffee mug): ""Here's your Sanka"". Stan: ""You're welcome"". But no. At Inspection, they strike up a conversation with an Official, that's L & H, yes. But when they think he has not moved very high up the ranks, Ollie says he's finally met someone dumber than Stan. He could have said that to Stan directly (and Stan nods affirmatively!) but is overheard, resulting in the Sergeant's yelling. That's their style, Ollie always believing that dumb remarks are his *partner's* domain.
I disagreed with Randy on his point about an earlier script draft subplot in GG. Stan and Ollie were to compete for the attention of a young lady working at the Army Base, which the author says would split the teamwork. In a gem of a two-reeler from 1934, The Private Life Of Oliver The Eighth, the boys both set out to court Mae Busch, and the results were sensational. The writer also mentioned that Stan's suggestion that the upper-birth scene - a reworking that actually works! - would have benefited by a change in the setting from a train to a plane. Watching this movie and the good scene in which they do take flight with the ""Big Noise"", it's interesting to realize that this was perhaps a time when the studio *was* right. Another point on this under-appreciated effort: it's very possible that audiences enjoyed, as I do, the *nostalgia* element - it's fun to be reminded of classic business, even if it comes off a bit awkward.
By the way, the above-mentioned commentary Feature is slightly difficult to navigate. When ""Resume Film"" is accessed, the author's voice is engaged.

If you love this duo, read ""Mr. Laurel & Mr. Hardy"" by John McCabe (available from Amazon), written about 40 years ago.  He is passionate about L&H and speaks sadly of these later films when the STUDIOS prevented them from doing what they did best: making people laugh with their own brand of gentle and whimsical humor.

Let me quote just a bit from McCabe's book: ""On the set of Great Guns, they were given their marching orders: do it the studio way or not at all.  Any attempt to do things the old way, the Laurel & Hardy way, was not only resisted, but put down...their beautifully intelligent unintelligence is gone.  They exist simply as stupid boobies....Jitterbugs was worse...the plot and comedy of The Big Noise can be put in a sentence: The boys had to deliver a powerful bomb. They did....'What was there for us to do but get out' Stan asks with bitterness. 'We had no say in those films and it sure looked it...It was sickening.""

Do yourself a favor and find copies of Saps At Sea, Blockheads, A Chump At Oxford, Sons of the Desert or other of their classic Roach films...even better find some of their simply wonderful two reelers.

Laurel and Hardy may have lost some creative freedom in their later works, but they were still Laurel and Hardy.  People that criticise the later works are saying these great comedians were only as good as their material.  This is so far from the truth. These guys are masters at what they do.

2499580,4,B000E6ESF8,"This last month has been a fantastic one for fans of the greatest film comedy team of all time Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.

Turner most recently released a two disc set with two Laurel and Hardy classics 'Bonnie Scotland' and 'Fra Diavolo'on it. Preceding this release however was THIS one from Fox featuring three of the Boys features for that company 'Great Guns','The Big Noise' and 'Jitterbugs'.

All are wonderfully restored in picture and sound. 20th century Fox is to be commended for their obvious diligence in this respect. Also included on these discs are some enjoyable additions which include rare news footage of The Boys selling War Bonds and at a railroad opening and a nice little special on the Laurel and Hardy fan club the Sons of the Desert.

Regardless of where one stands in so far as ones' oppinions about these movies go,I think it is not only grand but historically important(especially in the L&H cannon)to have these films finally released at all. And I for one couldn't be happier to see them.

Stan Laurel was greatly discouraged and resented the way Fox treated them during their tenure there. Their attempts at creative input of any kind during the making of the films generally failed at every turn. Stan disliked that but he did NOT dislike the movies themselves. They were after all good money makers for Fox and Stan himself was not adverse to a little ""praise"" for some of them.(For an in depth and thorough look at this period in The Boys careers I highly recommend Scott McGillivrays' marvellous book ""Laurel and Hardy-from the 40s Forward"").

When I watch these movies I KNOW they aren't in the same category as their previous output from the Roach Studios BUT:

1. All of the films have numerous moments that are VERY worthy of praise and of the team as a whole and

2. They show two comedy PROs at work. They were very much in command of their comedy,characters and timing. Nothing in THEM had changed..it is the scripts/Fox system that are to blame here for any shortcomings.

In conclusion I highly recommend this wonderful set that Fox has released,on both  technical and historical grounds. It is very worthy of  Laurel and Hardy and very much worthy of a special place in your DVD collection. Let's look forward to their next and final release which should contain 'The Bullfighters','Dancing Masters' and ""A Haunting We Will Go"".

The boys are also shown participating in the grand opening of a mini railroad where Ollie has some trouble getting into the small cars.  Both of these clips were used in Movietone Newsreels, but the actual clips here are the raw footage (the railroad story is mostly silent, the narrator had not yet been added).

There is a wealth of stills & newspaper clippings, but the text of the clippings is soft and hard to read on a large screen TV.  Fox seems to have found 5 preview trailers for their 6 films (the A Haunting We Will Go pre-view is not here), this hints of Fox's intent to release the other 3 if this set does well.  Most of the preview trailers seem to be from un-finished negatives.  Only a few have the on-screen graphics, most don't.  These master negatives allow Fox to create pre-views for multiple countries in different languages.  While it would have been nice to see the completed English trailers with all of the graphics, it is good to have something to show us how the movies were promoted.

There is also a 30 minute documentary on the Laurel & Hardy fan club called THE SONS OF THE DESERT (of which I belong to two tents), it was produced in 1987 when some of the interviewed people who knew the boys were still alive.  This special may not be for everyone, like Star Trek fans watching a documentary about trekker conventions, but I enjoyed every minute (my wife left the room).  I hope the inclusion of this documentary will help increase attendance and membership to the local tents.  Anything that helps make fans of the boys aware of the organization of other fans is great for everyone!

Now if only Hallmark would treat the boys with this dignity!  I know the pre-view trailers for ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" and ""Babes In Toyland"" exist, maybe more exist.",1144800000,11,2239,4.5
2499585,5,B000E6ESF8,"As one who has never believed that Laurel and Hardy's Fox films were worthy of their terrible reputations (A-HAUNTING WE WILL GO excepted), I was anxiously awaiting this set, combined with much apprehension upon hearing that author Randy Skretvedt -- who positively ripped the Fox films in his nevertheless excellent book -- was going to do the audio commentaries.  I expected the worst.  Well, surprise, surprise, or to quote another Laurel and Hardy title, ""Wrong Again!""  Skretvedt's commentaries are knowledgable, enjoyable, and actually very apologetic as compaired to what he wrote so many years ago.  Particularly in regard to THE BIG NOISE -- which I've always considered an undervalued masterpiece anyway -- Skretvedt does an about-face to his written words and now declares it to be his second favorite (after THE BULLFIGHTERS) of all the Fox films.  He's even brave enough to admit that he wasn't able to actually see the Fox films when he wrote his book, and relied on memory to write he comments, something that always leads to problems. Regardless, no matter what one thinks of the films, Fox Video has put out a beautiful package, with excellent transfers, a documentary, and trailers.  There are even liner notes by Silvia Stoddard, who writes like she never even heard of Laurel and Hardy before she wrote the notes.  Even with that blot, it's a beautiful package, and I look forward to Vol 2.",1144713600,13,1410,4.974468085106383
2499586,1,B000E6ESF8,"...is, sadly, not ""worth seeing anyway"", as some folks claim. These are sad, dull, humorless films with two dull, humorless characters who don't look or act like Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy, all the more sad because they ARE Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy. Fox crushed all of the humor out of them and put them in weak Abbott & Costello ripoffs (GREAT GUNS) or gave them scripts that the Bowery Boys would've rejected. In 1938, they made one of their best pictures, the hilarious BLOCK-HEADS, for Hal Roach, and within 3 years they were washed up in films, thanks to horrible movies like these. As another reviewer mentioned, a week later Warners is releasing an L&H DVD collection with one of their best films, THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (FRA DIAVOLO) and some very funny sequences from other films. Skip this and buy that, but by all means order a copy of Randy Skretvedt's essential book on Stan & Ollie to go with it.",1141862400,10,909,4.58282208588957
2499587,4,B000E6ESF8,"The 1940s Laurel & Hardy movies have gotten a real bum rap in several books  about the team, but in truth, few people have actually watched these pictures in the past 40 years. They may not be classics, nor the ""best"" work of L&H, but they're amusing comedies and perfect family entertainment, especially compared to the ""comedies"" of today.

One of the movies in this set, ""The Big Noise,"" has been listed as one of the worst movies of all time, but in no way is that really true. It's in fact a great introduction to Laurel & Hardy for kids. I recently showed this picture to some kids and they loved it. I thought it had a lot of laughs as well.

""Great Guns"" was very successful when it came out and when I saw it recently, I laughed so hard I cried. I haven't seen ""Jitterbugs"" in about 30 years, but I thought it was funny when I saw it on TV in the '70s.

So, give this set a chance and you'll be glad you did! And I can't wait for Part II.  And then let's reissue the two 1940s MGM L&H movies as well.",1141084800,17,1009,4.075757575757576
2499588,3,B000E6ESF8,"Laurel and Hardy -- and especially Laurel -- would have been the first to admit that the movies they did for 20th Century-Fox in the 1940's were not their greatest work. That said, they did a lot of misfires for Hal Roach, too. (Watch BONNIE SCOTLAND, due out on DVD in April, and you'll see what I mean.) And the paucity of *any* L&H DVDs is so sad that even the announcement of Fox's DVD release of three of their middling L&H movies is cause for at least minor joy.

Of the trio being released, the one with the best reputation is JITTERBUGS, mainly because of its high production values and its hilarious L&H impersonations (Ollie as a windbag Kentucky colonel, Stan as a fuddy-duddy British aunt). It has its share of fits and starts but is funny enough.

The movie with the worst rep is THE BIG NOISE, long regarded by L&H buffs as their worst-ever movie. It rips off a lot of their old routines and has somewhat leaden pacing, but even this movie has its moments. (For total L&H character assassination, wait until Fox releases THE DANCING MASTERS.) The movie also stars a young Robert (""Bobby"") Blake, six decades before his own notoriety with a deadly weapon.

GREAT GUNS was L&H's first Fox movie and the first indication that things were awry in Stan-and-Ollie Land. The movie is an obvious rip-off of Abbott & Costello's then-current Army comedy BUCK PRIVATES, with L&H forced into war hijinx when the rich youngster they caretake goes in for the draft. But again, L&H manage to overcome the so-so script and create some comedy out of nothing (particularly Stan with his charming pantomime).

Laurel & Hardy are national treasures in my book, and the lack of DVDs of their best work (currently owned, and doled out sparely, by Hallmark Home Entertainment) is appalling. So pick up the Fox set, uneven as it is, and discover how even these in-and-out comedies play better than much contemporary stuff.",1140566400,20,1912,4.6985074626865675
2499589,5,B000E6ESF8,"While Laurel and Hardy's films at the bigger studios during the 1940s are often maligned as inferior to their classics of the 20s and the 30s.  When taken at their own merit, these later films are pleasant and enjoyable.  I actually think Jitterbugs is the weakest and least funny in this set, but it is by no means a bad movie.  Great Guns is a fun army comedy, and The Big Noise is not their worst film -- it is their most underrated.  Not a classic, but certainly an amusing feature.  Since this is Volume One, we can look forward to the release of the other three Fox films, including The Bullfighters, which is one of their best from this period, The Dancing Masters, which is amusing, and A-Haunting We Will Go, which is, indeed, a bit slow.  This review is written prior to the DVD release, so I can only assess the merit of the films.  This set, and its forthcoming volume two, are most welcome.",1139616000,8,903,4.37125748502994
