8655952,5,B00K5EFE0W,"This movie is mesmerizing, completely pulled me in, and shook me up!!  Great lead performers, entrancing cinematography, does indeed have some tricks built into the ending.  I saw it at QFest in Philadelphia, a LGBT festival and some of the audience was in a bit of a stupor when it ended.  It's an intense ride and keeps the viewer engaged to its ending, and for me, for a couple of days after.  Main actors are really sexy and the film shows all that can happen in the ""scene"".  Reminded me of how some gay life can exist in an underground, and (at times) alternate universe.  The question of whether a missing person might have simply stepped into a new reality, or dimension is explored in a unique way.  It's like a roller coaster that gets you going down a steep hill and just keeps going.",1400716800,6,795,4.441379310344828
8655953,3,B00K5EFE0W,"This is a German indie production and stars Fernando Tielve (`Pan's Labyrinth' and `The Devil's Backbone') as Luis. He has split up with his boyfriend in Madrid and gone off to Berlin to lose himself in a hedonistic knees up. Once there he goes out clubbing and runs into some Germans who all speak English as indeed does he.

Soon he has met Viktor who leaves a lot to be desired and also has clearly got something to hide. But Luis falls for him. We also have the story of a missing Greek boy and the search that his sister is carrying out to find him. Oh and yes they too can speak very good English. It is very clear very quick that there has been a connection with Viktor and the missing boy, but has there been foul play? Is it drug induced paranoia or are we all being left a lot of red herrings? Well I don't want to spoil the plot but this did require a lot of faith to get to the end. Luis just keeps doing the dumb things that any sensible person would run a mile from and you start to not really care towards the end.

There are a couple of plot holes too but also a major twist or twists that are deliberately confusing but clearly done intentionally. This is far from being a bad film but it is also far from being a great one. As I said, in English, Spanish, German and Greek running to 95 minutes. It has scenes of mild sex, some also mild drug taking and some trancy club music in case you don't like that sort of thing. One that was ok once so if in any doubt go for the rental - there is little to warrant a second viewing once you get the twists.",1399766400,5,1566,4.048387096774194
