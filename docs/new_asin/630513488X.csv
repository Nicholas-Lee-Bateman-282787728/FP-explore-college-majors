7883646,5,630513488X,Saw it on  TV  and  it was a  good  Biker  Movie.  Jamie  Woolfet  was good.  I added it to my  biker collextion,1464220800,,112,3.6363636363636362
7883647,3,630513488X,Saw this once before and was not too engaged with at all. But what heck I thought perhaps I'll try it again since it was on Amazon's prime list. Well the results were about the same.,1388966400,,182,4.083333333333333
7883648,3,630513488X,"Mark Dascascos takes a step away from his usual straight-to-video martial arts B-titles with this dark and disturbing drama involving a recently-paroled drummer trying to get his life together. After getting caught up in a bloody ambush involving drugs, Dascascos and his old cellmate, a strung-out junkie, played by Jaimz Woolvet, head on the road. Mark's character, Jesse, is hoping to earn a gig as a drummer for a band in Detriot but is unaware that he and his buudy are being tracked by the vengeful siblings of the slain drug dealers they left dead.
""Boogie Boy"" is a decent turn for Dascascos who is best known for his work as a martial arts movie star. There is some decent humor in here and the writing shows glimpses of wit though the film really never goes anywhere as far as overall storytelling is concerned. If you're looking for a good time-killer, this isn't a bad movie at all. For those wondering, the ""From The Academy-Award Winning Writer Of Pulp Fiction"" title on the cover sleeve refers to executive producer Roger Avery who co-wrote the first draft of ""Fiction"".",1078099200,5,1085,4.776595744680851
7883649,5,630513488X,"Boogie Boy delves into the world of drugs in a unique and facinating way. The fine actors in this film do an excellent job of revealing the characters' personalities. The director brings all the layers of friendship, devotion, betrayal, mystery and action in a believable and inspiring way. Mark Dacascos is finally able to display his excellent acting skills in the role of Jessie Page. Jessie is fresh out of jail determined to stay out for good. His best friend talks him into one last drug deal which goes bad. The storyline in Boogie Boy is very good. The ending is excellent. The acting, superb. The fight scenes are very well done. The humor is great. I highly recommend this film. This film is not for younger children.",993254400,5,727,4.6875
7883650,4,630513488X,"Mark Dacascos hooks up with his prison cellmate (and sometimes lover) Jaimz Wolvett (Schofield Kid from UNFORGIVEN), and agrees to come along on ONE MORE job.  Unfortunately, the drug-buy goes bad and Dacascos (whose  history in kung-fu flicks serves him well) wastes the double-crossing  punks.  Trouble is, the double-crossing punks were the little brothers of  some REALLY BAD hombres, who set out after Dacascos and the rest of  Wolvett's crew (which includes the always slut-o-licious Tracy Lords in a  stand-out role). Dacascos and Wolvett end up at a desert motel, occupied  only by the owner (Frederick Forrest), and his super-fey wife.  The  killers, however, are not far behind.  Let the bottom-kicking commence!  This film really incorporates elements of exploitation, prison-flicks,  martial arts chop-suey, and acid rock-n-roll movies and filme noir, and  does it in an INCREDIBLY skillful manner.  I LOVED this movie!  I rented  this expecting basically a kick-butt and shotgun-splatter buddy flick (and  wasn't disappointed in either regard), but there's a lot more here.  The  performances are really solid, especially kung-fu star Dacascos and  teen-porn-star Lords, who for me moved into the realm of ""real  actors"" with this film.  Wolvett, as always, is quirky and  fascinating, and Forrest is awesome as the doped up and margirita'd out  proprieter of the motel. Also, look for Joan Jett as a rock-n-roller (did I  mention this film is also partly THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM...?) If you  like movies about the dark underbelly of man's soul (is that a mixed  metaphor...?  Sorry...) ala THE KILLERS, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, and  THIEF, you should definitely see this movie!",920505600,7,1697,5.2706766917293235
