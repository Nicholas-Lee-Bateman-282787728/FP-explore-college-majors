They were based on the toys not vica versa but the stories were better than the toys as was the acting.  These were complicated, if at times camped with bad animation stories that were enjoyable despite the animae quality graphics the acting and plots were deep, for a kid's show and Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors never talked down to us(a rareity in those days) as much as I liked the vehicles, I liked the people more, and even at age fifteen the characters were more interesting than thier machines which is what the show was about.
