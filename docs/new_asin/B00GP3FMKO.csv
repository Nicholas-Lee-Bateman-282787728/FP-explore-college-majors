8625980,4,B00GP3FMKO,"This is a very entertaining film--hence the 4 stars, but I was disappointed to find that the Elephant Films/French Blu Ray would not play in my Sony BDP S1100 blu ray player (it did play the Elephant Films logo/intro--then nothing). There was nothing in Amazon's Product Description or Editorial Review sections to indicate it wouldn't work on my system. Maybe it's a problem with this particular model Sony player.",1441756800,,415,5.028985507246377
