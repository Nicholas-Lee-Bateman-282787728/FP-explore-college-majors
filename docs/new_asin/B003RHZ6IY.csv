8403644,3,B003RHZ6IY,"These rootless nerds meander through early adulthood without much passion.  The city of San Francisco becomes an imposing character of it's own.  It neither seeks to inspire them nor spoil their sexual adventures.  Friends of friends keep bumping into each other at the same parties, bars, restaurants, and theaters.  It can be with a sense of warmth, slight unease, or annoyed indifference.  What makes this film worth watching once is that they all seem to be hitting the exact stage of life where grand ambition has subsided, tedium and repetition has crept into their lives, but a mature self aware perspective has not yet developed.  If you are a mid 20's city dweller, it might seem eerily familiar.",1420588800,,705,4.932203389830509
8403645,5,B003RHZ6IY,"I saw this film when it played at BAM last near here in Brooklyn.  I found it very charming, and the story wasn't as familar as I expected.  It's a romantic comedy, but things end up more like real life than the usual film.  I thought it was quite funny, and I'd be glad to see it again.",1281398400,3,287,3.913793103448276
8403646,5,B003RHZ6IY,"I saw this featuure film at SXSW 2009.  ""Sorry, Thanks"" is a delightful un-romantic comedy set in San Francisco's Mission District.  It features a great cast and a whip smart script. An entertaining way to spend ninety minutes of your time.",1281398400,2,240,4.829268292682927
8403647,4,B003RHZ6IY,This is exactly the kind of movie I would buy and watch over and over again when I was single (and without cable tv).  It's funny and endearing.,1281398400,,144,4.142857142857143
8403648,5,B003RHZ6IY,"This is a delightful and all-too-real portrayal of several
20-somethings stumbling through their lives and doing the best they
can, but not really getting anywhere and not understanding why. Wiley
Wiggins does a great job as Max whose life is as aimless as his work.

It combines the Hollywood buddy and relationship movies without being
either exactly, but rather becomes more of a comment on how something
isn't quite there.

It's very well directed, acted and beautifully written with an
absolutely perfect ending. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even with all of my
cringing. And yes, I will see it again.",1281398400,5,602,5.01
8403649,5,B003RHZ6IY,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The acting is tight and it's interesting to watch and funny, which is most important.  Wiley Wiggins is great.  All of the actors are so good that you feel like you're watching some friends from behind a curtain or something.  It's a simple film but really really enjoyable.  I highly recommend it.  I'm going to give it as a gift to a friend of mine who loves woody allen and kevin smith movies.",1281398400,,426,4.397435897435898
8403650,5,B003RHZ6IY,"sorry, Thanks is a great film. It's like watching your friends tell all their secrets. You really feel like you know these people and it's great fun to watch their lives. Wiley Wiggins is great and now that he's older he's even better than the films he did with Richard Linklater when he was a kid. I have to be honest, I thought this was just going to be one of those talking heads films, but I couldn't stop watching because the acting was so good. Check it out.
What's great about it: It's real, funny and entertaining. What's not so great: I kinda wish things would end differently, but I can't say more!",1281398400,,608,4.342105263157895
8403651,4,B003RHZ6IY,"I love this movie! There was something extremely refreshing about it--excellent writing without being too writer-y. Just really funny and sweet and great. I think if you like romantic comedies, this definitely doesn't fall into the genre, but I daresay you'll find it ten million times better than anything that does. Wiley Wiggins is awesome in it, as is the guy who plays his friend.",1281398400,,385,4.938461538461539
8403652,5,B003RHZ6IY,"This is such a wonderful film - sweet, honest, funny and engaging - it's easy to watch and highly enjoyable.  Definitely NOT a typical cheese-ball romantic comedy with a predictable, boring ending.  I found so many moments to be real and easy to relate to.  The acting is great, it's beautifully shot and well composed.  Highly recommend!",1281398400,,338,4.87719298245614
