8619187,5,B00FXBYCA0,"The DVD is only in German - there are no subtitles (neither German nor English) and no alternate audio tracks.  So only if you are fluent in the German language should you buy this.
The movie itself is a very good adaptation of Martha Grimes' story and characters.  The scenery is lush and authentic (it was filmed in England) and the actors are talented.
Unfortunately for me, my German is only middling, and without subtitles I struggled with following the conversations.  But that's my own problem - not a problem with the movie.
And this is the only adaptation of a Martha Grimes novel ever, so that made it worth watching for a fan like me!",1478217600,,645,4.543103448275862
