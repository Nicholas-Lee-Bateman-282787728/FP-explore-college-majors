2290876,5,B0009I2OQG,I ordered this cd for my 3 yr old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves to sing and dance. She loves it!,1358121600,,105,4.0476190476190474
2290877,3,B0009I2OQG,"Disappointed with new Shortcake.  Too much magic and bad and/or evil characters. It was for my granddaughter, but sent it back",1355443200,,126,5.0
2290878,5,B0009I2OQG,This was a great addition to my daughters movie collection. She loves anything dealing with strawberry shortcake and she watches them all the time!!,1325289600,,148,5.208333333333333
2290879,3,B0009I2OQG,"The show itself is cute, and I think it has a great moral (as all the shortcake movies do) when the villain ""Sour Grapes"" learns that helping others is more fulfilling and enjoyable than deceiving them.  I had hoped it would be more interactive, (inspire my daughter to get up and dance with the movie, but it didn't)and my copy DID NOT COME WITH THE DANCE MAT THAT THE DESCRIPTION HAD PROMISED!!!  But overall it is OK; my daughter watches it occassionally, but it is not her favorite shortcake movie.  I think her favorites are Big Country Fun and Glimmer Berry Ball, just an FYI.",1312675200,,582,4.523809523809524
2290880,5,B0009I2OQG,"This was my daughter's first Strawberry Shortcake dvd.  She's watched it over and over; she was 2.5 when we got it and is now 4.5 years old and still likes it.  And she learned the dance moves, sort of.  She loves to dance along with the dance mat.  there's also a special feature with a music video where SSC and the friends play instruments, so my daughter likes to get out her guitar and pretend to be one of the girls.  My boys also like this video too and they were 5 when we bought it and still like it at age 7!.",1268179200,,519,4.0
2290881,5,B0009I2OQG,This is one of our favorite Strawberry Shortcake DVDs- the songs and messages are great!!,1243036800,,89,5.0
2290882,4,B0009I2OQG,This dvd will be a birthday gift for a granddaughter later this month.  It was a request from her mother.  The product arrived quickly and was in good condition.,1199577600,,161,4.517241379310345
2290883,5,B0009I2OQG,"""Let's Dance"" is another great Strawberry Shortcake video.  A few of the previous videos before this one have been lacking, but this one makes up for them.  It is now one of the best video in the collection so far.

The first part of the video is about the Purple Pieman and Sour Grapes trying to steal this years berries.  Sour Grapes pretends to be a famous dance teacher to keep the kids busy while Pieman takes the berries, but everything goes wrong for Pieman when Sour Grapes begins to enjoy teaching the kids.

The second part of the video is when the kids meet Apricot for the first time.  Apricot learns that you don't have to pretend to be someone you are not so that other will like you.  It really has a good message for being yourself and friendship.",1195603200,10,763,4.368794326241135
2290884,3,B0009I2OQG,"The movie was good and my 7-yr old daughter enjoyed it, but the bonus dancing feature was a little disappointing.  There is only one dance and it hardly even uses the provided mat.",1194220800,10,180,4.454545454545454

8061009,5,B0009I2OQG,My threeyearold granddaughter is very happy with this video.  Even her nineyearold big sister said it was a very nice story.  It is a sweet story line.,1427068800,,151,4.555555555555555

8061013,1,B0009I2OQG,"After Betty Hutton's smarmy, greedy success in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" MGM realized that they were stuck with with a truly non-musical star.  Girl can't sing.  Girl can't act.  Girl can dance a little.

So the studio threw her on to the ever increasingly creaking Fred Astaire.

It's an embarassment of a musical.  It's an embarassment for Fred Astaire.  It's an embarassment for MGM.

It's not, however, an embarassment for Betty Hutton, as she was too greedy to know any better.

In the end she found God.  I hope He helped her.

In the end, I found this movie in the bargain box at a used book-store.

Lousy score.  Astaire has no joy in him with this one.. A pedantic Astaire?  Who would've thougt?  Nothing about his dancing or the directing suggest innovation or inspiration.  For the Astaire afficionado's, one must agree that NOTHING is inspiring for him in this film. It's a shame and a sham.  You will be disappointed if you watch this horror of a ""musical"".  Ugh.",1367712000,,971,4.6117647058823525
8061014,5,B0009I2OQG,My 3 year old daughter loves this movie! The price made the deal even better. Will buy other movies of this type again.,1365120000,,119,4.217391304347826
