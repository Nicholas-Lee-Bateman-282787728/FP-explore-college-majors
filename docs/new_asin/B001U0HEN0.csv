8342553,5,B001U0HEN0,"This video brings the natural beauty of Africa into your home, the Landscapes and the Animals are truly magnificent. This is a relaxation video, for people who just want to enjoy and relax to the natural beauty of planet earth. The HiDef video is stunning, really brings out the beauty of HD. This is ""NOT"" an animal channel type documentary, if you want to see animals kill each other or hear a boring narrator expound upon the obvious then this is not the video for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in nature and its beauty in magnificent HiDef then this is a winner. Relax and enjoy with beautiful imagery and music. I got the Blu-Ray version and I love it.",1285545600,7,668,4.439024390243903
8342554,2,B001U0HEN0,"Scenes of the animals lacked action.  Some animal kills or chases, predators stalking, or life or death situations would have made the disk more interesting.",1273363200,2,157,5.28
8342555,3,B001U0HEN0,The DVD  background is music only.  I would appreciate narrative discussing the landscape.,1256256000,3,90,5.846153846153846
