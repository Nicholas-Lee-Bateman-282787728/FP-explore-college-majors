I was excited about watching this show and I got disappointed with the technical situation.

Best regards

6069941,4,B00GBJTK1E,"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Roxette. The first thing I noticed is that Marie seems to have lost most of her ability to move, jump and prance across the stage like she used to and she seemed to have aged too quickly. But that may be true for most of us fans as well. I know she had some health issues and it seemed to have robbed her of her confidence with her balance. But make no mistake about it, she still sing very well. And I feel happy to see her back onstage, in Blu-ray, even if she's not yet 100%. I read somewhere that Per is a David Bowie fan, but to me, his songs sounds like a cross between McCartney and ELO, which are also my favorites. The performance was excellent but the disc does not play on my Blu-ray player. I think it's the region thing but it did play on my computer. That's the only reason I gave this only 4 star. I had to find a way to make it play on my Blu-ray player",1395187200,,909,3.89247311827957
6069942,5,B00GBJTK1E,"I lived in Florida at the time of the 2012 tour that hit only 4 cities in the USA, I drove my ass to Boston to catch this concert at the House of Blues (same night as the MDNA Madonna concert at the TD North Center) and it was worth every cent to drive there. This cd captures the concert audio wise beautifully. The added dvd was worth the concert/documentary as well. Get it!",1391040000,,377,4.108108108108108
6069943,3,B00GBJTK1E,"First and foremost, this Blu-ray will NOT play on most U.S. players.  It is in PAL format and would only play on my region-free player.

I was fortunate to catch Roxette on this tour.  They sounded great and were backed up by a top-notch band.  The set list is very impressive on this disc, with 20 songs that include all the big hits Roxette fans know and love.  The audio on this Blu-ray is very impressive with several options including a DTS-MA 5.1 track that is clear and has plenty of punch.  There is also a nice hour-long documentary and a 16 track CD included.

Unfortunately, this is the worst video quality I have ever seen on Blu-ray.  The picture is grainy and colors are dull.  Many camera shots are completely out of focus.  Worst of all is the editing.  The camera angle changes at least every two seconds.  If you are prone to seizures this video may kill you.  There are also far too many close-ups of instruments and the performers backs.

I have been a huge fan of Roxette ever since they released ""Look Sharp.""  I was really looking forward to this Blu-ray but I'm really disappointed in it.  In the future, I will probably just play the Blu-ray for the audio and not even turn on the TV.",1389484800,8,1209,4.402714932126697

Neither worked.  One a positive note, returns were easy and customer service was very good on Amazon.  It did however cost me for the return packaging on both occasions and my time.",1399680000,,353,4.46875
