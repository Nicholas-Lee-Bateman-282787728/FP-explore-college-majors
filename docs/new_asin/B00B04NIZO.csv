5538920,5,B00B04NIZO,"I'm not going to write a long review with lots of spoilers, I will just say that this made-for-TV mini-series is one of my favorites.  It's family appropriate, but also has lots of one liners and innuendos that will keep the grownups laughing along too. This is a good old fashioned fairy tale...with lots of twists and modern touches.  It keeps your interest, it's funny and it's just plain FUN to watch!",1362441600,35,405,4.611111111111111
5538921,5,B00B04NIZO,"I have been looking for the 10th Kingdom on DVD for about a year that was at a reasonable price. I wanted to get it for my mom for Christmas, because it has been her favorite ever since it premiered in 2000. I held out since I didn't want to pay $30 for a DVD, but I bought her the VHS for 4 bucks. Now I've pre-ordered this at a great price, absolutely perfect! The movie is 6 hours of epic fantasy, with an amazing cast, and a creative and enticing storyline that mixes a modern family into a fairytale world that wasn't exactly happily ever after. I would recommended this to everyone of all ages!",1361836800,57,600,4.181034482758621
5538922,5,B00B04NIZO,"I just pre-ordered- absolutely loved it when it first aired on NBC in 2000, and I've adored it ever since. I'm actually repurchasing this because my current DVDs of the series have been so well loved they're a bit scratched. If you're into Once Upon a Time, you will really enjoy this. I cannot believe there has not been a sequel!",1360540800,52,331,4.442622950819672

5538925,5,B00B04NIZO,"I watched this show as a kid with my mom and we LOVED it! I bought one for myself and her as well and was so excited to see it again!
The only thing I didn't like was that the disks are stacked on top of each other rather than having the own space for each disk, but they weren't scratched and were delivered safely.",1523232000,,316,3.876923076923077
5538926,5,B00B04NIZO,"Great cast. Great story. Great mini series. I have been watching this since it was originally released and every year multiple times since.

5538981,5,B00B04NIZO,"I will always love watching the 10th Kingdom. It's an adult fairy tale with loads of humor. It is much cleaner than your average TV shows because sex is not the prevalent subject nor does it ever hit you smack in the face with obscene unexpected smut. There isn't a large spew profanity other than the phrase: ""Sunken Elf"" or anything close to a donkey, and the rest is left to your own imagination. I like watching it closer to bedtime when I am having a hard time falling to sleep because the entry song, ""I'm wishing on a star...."", is soothing, restful, and comes in on each new scene... Something about the movie is nostalgic and tends to keep your interest without drowning you in boredom.",1498435200,,695,4.480314960629921

5538987,3,B00B04NIZO,"*******SPOILER ALERT******

I couldn't understand why this was so highly rated. The acting is way over the top by the trolls and the wolf. It doesn't blend well with the rest of the cast. The storyline is weird. Why is the lead character getting pregnant in a kid's story? Why does the wicked queen end up being bad to the bone all the way to the end? I kept expecting her to do a ""gotcha."" Why does the female lead fall in love with the wolf? He's a liar. He's stupid. He's not very likable. The segue with the Peeps is strange. Anyway, the over all effect is okay, but I am not sure I'd watch it again.",1496620800,,604,4.11864406779661

5538996,5,B00B04NIZO,"The 10th Kingdom is a wonderful miniseries. Ive watched this series multiple times. Its that good, fun for kids of all ages. It ranks up there with my other favorite miniseries such as Band of Brothers, Pride and Prejudice (1995), Lonesome Dove, Return to Lonesome Dove, Comanche Moon, The Astronaut Wives Club, etc.

The guy who plays the wolf character in The 10th Kingdom had the thankless role of Max in the Gilmore Girls.

When Im not watching episodic storytelling Im reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy.

Sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ray Bradbury, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, William R. Forstchen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, George Orwell, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R.

5539009,5,B00B04NIZO,"This is the BEST miniseries I have ever watched.  It's fun and almost innocent (something many shows today are lacking), and that is part of the charm of the show. It has some sexual innuendo, some outright violence (though not graphic, and furthers the story line), and lots of mischeif.  For very young children, you may want to skip over the violent scenes and while it may impact the individual story line, it will not impact the overall story.  We have enjoyed this show as a family every since it first came out on DVD, and this copy is for a DD who is getting ready to spread her wings and fly and wanted a little taste of home to take with her.  I recommend this DVD to everyone.  Although I will never hear the song ""We will rock you"" the same way again!""",1488153600,,764,4.277777777777778

5539025,5,B00B04NIZO,"I love fairy tales and even those this is so super cheesy, I love every minute of it. It takes all kinds of fairy tales and stories from childhood, put a spin on it and put's it together. The wolf is my favorite. Again, it's cheesy, but that's why I like it!",1484611200,,258,3.980769230769231

It's wonderful for adults and older children alike!  It's a little dark for young children. Trolls & war in the kingdoms but very entertaining.,1483574400,,284,4.320754716981132
5539032,5,B00B04NIZO,"This is a fun series. Familiar characters from childhood stories and songs, romance, silly jokes, adventure, magic, lots of twists, turns, and surprises. It also contains some serious topics, such as prejudice, heroism, and greed. I have watched it 4 or 5 times, and each time I find more comments about society. 2 people in New York find themselves in a fairy-tale land, which is beautiful and dangerous. I don't remember Santa Claus being in the movie, but yes, Virginia, there is a Cinderella!",1483401600,,496,4.916666666666667

Not for small children, but older kids will enjoy the backstory of many familiar fairytales. One of my personal favorites.",1481846400,,296,4.4

5539051,4,B00B04NIZO,This is one of my favorite movies. It combines many classic fairy tales into one storyline. It is lengthy and can be easily watched over an extended time. It probably won't keep the interest of children.,1480723200,,203,4.666666666666667

5539060,4,B00B04NIZO,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the previews for this mini series. I thought it was to be a fluff piece on fairy tales. I was quite surprised to see the amazing make-up, the costumes and the scenery.
All those things make the series well worth the 4 hours. The storyline is interesting and has a number of fantasy filled subplots. The Trolls were scary and humorous at the same time. The clash of the parallel worlds was done well, with much attention to detail. The different 'kingdoms' were distinguishable and each unique and fantastic. I see definite Emmy nominations and awards here, especially for make-up, costumes, and script.",1479168000,,642,4.741071428571429

I don't remember it being as long as it is, but it's best to think of it like a bunch of little movies instead of one TV show as each episode clocks in at about an hour and a half. The acting is cheesy, the special effects are rough, but underneath, it's a great and entertaining show that has me watching it again after 16 years. For the money I paid, it was well worth a buy.",1474416000,,496,3.688679245283019

5539140,5,B00B04NIZO,"This has been one of my favorite shows for over a decade. The combination of a fairytale setting with a golden age that has decidedly ended and characters from a modern setting that matched our childhoods, if not our current day, takes my lifelong love for fantasy fiction and lets me watch a relatable young woman grapple with challenge of being thrown into the middle of one. Add some political intrigue and a wide range of tones--from comedic to romantic to grim to defiant--and this mini-series offers high quality content in a style I don't often get to enjoy in video. I love every episode.",1464825600,,596,4.685714285714286
5539141,5,B00B04NIZO,"This is one of my all-time favorite miniseries.  I adore fairy tales and this is a dandy.  I was always sad they didn't make a sequel to this.  I watch it several times a year and I never fail to be enchanted.  Lots of humor and great characters.  Wolf is especially one of my favorite characters in it.  If you haven't seen it, be prepared for a treat.  Of course, if you don't like fairy tales this may not be your cup of tea.",1464739200,,428,4.023809523809524
5539142,4,B00B04NIZO,I love this movie!! The only drawback is the movie case it comes in. I prefer the DVD cases with individual places for each disc. Not all three discs layered on top of one another. Much more likely to scratch that way. Otherwise a perfect buy.,1464652800,,243,4.304347826086956

My friend made me watch it with her a few years back, I was a little intimated by the length but once we started watching I couldn't stop.

I do wish though that it made all the episodes into one long movie like they did on her set but if that's my biggest problem I can deal with it.

5539176,4,B00B04NIZO,"I read several reviews before buying because I wanted to get a family movie I could watch with my kids.  I couldn't find a review that thought it wasn't appropriate so I thought I would give it a shot.  Although my girls (9 & 6) enjoyed the movie - I had to send them out of the room or fast forward it several times because there were a lot of scary parts.  It's definitely a fun watch - another side of classic fairy tales - but it has a lot of killing scenes (like a lot) and several sexual references that I thought were inappropriate (although I think they were over my kids heads?), also some down right scary stuff (werewolf glowing eyes/transformation, corpse queen that was sort of alive, huntsman that is obsessed with killing people, severed troll head and all the killing in lots of different ways).  Although there were a lot of enjoyable and funny scenes, the whole movie had a dark undertone and the culmination of the plot of the movie was when you find out why the main character's mother left her when she was seven was because she tried to drown her and then she ends up killing her own mother in the end.  Even though the movie sort of had a happy ever after ending - it didn't at the same time.  All fine for adults or older kids to process but prob not for the little ones.  It was a good movie - just not what I expected.",1459814400,3,1344,4.2265625

You know how when you see a movie the first time when it first comes out and it has an indelible effect on you? Well the reviewers of this thing saw it in their adolescence and loved it. Now that they've grown up, they still remember it the way they first saw it, and so are unable to be objective about it. I can say, though, that seeing this for the first time in this day and age, and with a more ""mature"" level of taste, it does not hold up well.

I loved it then because of the references to fairy tales, but now that I'm an adult, I can fully appreciate all the jokes that whizzed over my head. The acting is pretty good (Diane West makes for a devious Evil Queen), the story is original, I like the character development, and Wolf still remains my favorite character. Every friend I have shown the 10th Kingdom to has loved it, and the only negative thing I can really say is that it's a shame a sequel was never made in spite of the implication at the end that there was more to the story.

5539321,5,B00B04NIZO,"I've always loved this movie ever since I watched it air week by week on tv. I've owned the VHS and original DVD versions of this movie and bought this one because it was so inexpensive.

While it brought back the nostalgia of watching each episode of the miniseries air by getting to watch the introductions more frequently, I was a little off-put by rather cheap construction of the case its self. All three dvds stack inside a case the size of that which holds a single disc. I've only had this for a little less than a week, and while its already been viewed start to finish 3 times and seems to have held up well, I'm concerned for its longevity...",1440374400,,653,4.352459016393443

Other than the slow shipping process, I am over all very happy since I love this show so much. The quality of the picture is great on the TV and the computer. I just don't like how the DVDs are all packed into the same case, they are very hard to get out without the risk of scratching the DVD.",1439942400,,441,4.0227272727272725
5539335,5,B00B04NIZO,"I have to admit, this miniseries can be a little cheesy and the acting isn's always that great. But I grew up watching this with both my sister and my grandma, and I have many childhood memories filled with the scenes of this show. I love the characters and I love the concept. Much of the soundtrack is a lot of fun to listen to.

I would give this series a try, even if fantasy isn't really your thing. There is something for everyone in it, and I seriously doubt that you will regret watching this in the long run. Believe it or not, it is also good for long distance watching with a friend; both a close friend and I have a DVD copy of this miniseries, and we used Skype while we both watched it. Even though we lived a couple hundred miles from each other, we both got to share the fun moments of this miniseries together.

I don't know if you will enjoy it as much as I have, especially considering that you're likely older than I was when I started watching it. But it is great for the whole family! Not to mention that it has a pretty great cast.",1439856000,,1054,4.136585365853659

I have it on DVD as well, but for $5 I bought this so I could download on our tablets.  It's full of lots of fairy tale characters, but it's after the happily ever after.  Prince Wendel is the grandson of Snow White.  He gets turned into a dog and escapes to the 10th Kingdom (or New York).  Virginia and her father follow Wendel back to his world to help him get sorted out.

5539420,5,B00B04NIZO,"When I first saw this on television, back in the Dark Ages when it was originally released, I was completely enchanted. I never had the opportunity to watch it again until I happened to find that it was available on DVD last year - either it hadn't been out previously or I had just somehow managed to miss it in past searches. My boyfriend is severely ADHD, so getting him to sit all the way through an hour-long television
show is usually difficult, and a 2 hour movie is so traumatic for him to be even relatively still for that I hadn't really pushed him that much toward watching all of the movies that I love, but that he has never seen before. This holds true particularly as our tastes vary so widely when it comes to the genres and types of things we each prefer to watch - it's difficult (not to mention unkind) to force someone to watch something you suspect they will probably hate, no matter how much you may love it. But when I got this, I was completely emphatic. He HAD to watch it. And I didn't give out my usual ""if you're not interested in the first hour, we'll stop it"" because I remembered that this is fairly slow to start (take note of this if you've never seen it before), and you have to really force yourself to pay attention thru the first couple of episodes (at least) before it gets to the point where you're involved in the story. He acquiesced and managed to sit still during all of the beginning stuff, which I tried to help make interesting with things like the ""wolf scratch"" (which has become a little code we use to one another in public now) and really playing up the entrance of the Trolls. I was frankly amazed by how much I remembered after only one viewing well over a decade ago, but this is a memorable movie, with memorable characters, and VERY memorable performances by a plethora of outstanding actors. My guy managed to make it thru the first 2 or 3 hours, and ended up loving it so much that I now never know when I may be told to ""Go suck an elf!"" or see a wolf scratch from across a crowded room. He's even mentioned wanting to watch it again sometime this year!
I'm not going to try and review things like the quality of the DVD or whether the sound measures up to some particular standard. The only thing that I will say is that when you're ordering it, be careful and be sure that you're ordering the entire miniseries AS IT WAS FIRST AIRED IN 2000. It was released both on VHS and DVD in cut-down versions - cutting out a total of 2 hours from the whole 10 hour movie - that supposedly didn't contain anything that would change the plot, but which I've read elsewhere changes the entire experience significantly. After all, you can't easily cut out nearly a quarter of a film and not take out something important! The DVD that I'm reviewing also has a bonus feature by John Larroquette that takes you to all of the amazing places they took the cast and crew in order to give this film the true ""fairy-tale"" look that sets it apart from other movies. Aside from this one piece of practicality that I felt I needed to include as a ""buyer beware"", this movie, for me, is entirely about escaping our world and going far away into another. My only regret is that after the passing of so much time since this was created, the likelihood of the sequel that was alluded to (or at least the door left open for) in the final episode is fairly slim. Although you never know - one of our heroes here is currently doing a quite commendable stint as a very long-lived character from the land of King Arthur on a television series, so anything is possible. After all, if Trolls can still be Stayin' Alive, then I will cheerfully keep my fingers crossed that The 10th Kingdom may still be revisited, and even Cinderella might still put on her dancing slippers one more time!
If you have never seen this, I hope that the above told you just enough to whet your interest without spoiling anything, and if you watched it long ago and are considering whether it might be worth giving it another try - do so. If you didn't care for it then remember that tastes and interests can change drastically over time, and if you did like it but had just sort of forgotten about it, you'll find it well worth a 2nd (and 3rd and maybe even 4th!) viewing.",1431216000,4,4276,4.3395755305867665

It is an exciting mix of humor, romance, adventure and fairy tales, on par if not better than Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal. Plus, it's got Rutger Hauer in there being a bad boy--and we all know how much we like that! If you have six hours free, I highly recommend this movie--just watch out because as soon as it is over you may be wishing that your timeframe had actually been twelve so you could watch it again.",1429315200,,501,4.175257731958763

I was introduced to it when I was much younger spending a couple weeks with my Grandmother and cousins away from home.  Though a bit dated now as far as graphics go, this is a wonderfully charming story, with romance, adventure, strife, character development, and a giant dose of humor.  It has an oddness to it that I think takes getting used to, something about the made for TV quality about it and interesting story line of worlds where all the fairy tales did happen, but now these kingdoms are past their happy ending pique.  If you take the time to watch this series all the way through, however, it has a wonderful conclusion and is a well loved favorite among my friends and family.",1429056000,,776,4.521428571428571

Pros:  Shipping was fast, packaging was good.  Good price too.  This version of the DVD release has the extended run-time release, not the abbreviated version that was released not long after it aired.

Cons:  I had forgotten this show wasn't originally targeted for young children.  It has a deceptively charming fairy tale theme, but can quickly become embroiled in adult themes including language, adult situations and mild violence.  As this was aired on TV in 2000 you don't really see anything, but it pushed a couple boundaries at the time.  Also, it's ""only"" 466 minutes long.

Thoughts:  Good mini-series, it was lots of fun.  DVD release is awesome.  Now I can share it with my kids.",1426809600,,757,4.775193798449612

5539522,3,B00B04NIZO,"A miniseries that sounds terrific- mystical, romantic, adventuresome, and lots of special effects- but, at least for me, turns out kind of off beat and boring.

Hallmark puts out this multicasted, fantasy-adventure with pretty good special effects and a story that mixes fairytales and various strange kingdoms from another dimension with everyday New York City reality.  The heroine's a waitress; her Dad's a janitor and they cross paths with a Prince turned into a dog, mean Stoogelike trolls and other creatures from another 'Kingdom'.  It's good vs. evil stuff, and it sure must look good on paper, but I have several reservations about the whole thing.

First, I found the characters not particularly interesting to a point that I cared about them(very important to make a story watchable).  Most of the humor is kind of sour and repeated, especially with the trolls.  This is not a family friendly film for little ones in the room.  It's Hallmark, no blood or swearing, but there's killing, piking, threatening no end and a fair amount of sexual innuendo.

The storyline does pick up after the first few episodes, and is helped with some romantic bantering and interaction with hero and heroine; moreover, there are parts that are amusing.  Finally, there are some very good actors here and excellent sets and backdrops with castles and outdoor shots.

Overall, I wouldn't watch it again, and I know there are tons of positive reviews, and I'll get blasted for my lukewarm one, but what can I say.  A nice travelogue through mystical kingdoms, turn off the sound and ignore the characters and story, and I'll simply enjoy the scenery.",1423612800,,1640,4.970695970695971

I don't like it quite as much as OUAT, but it is pretty great.  There is quite a bit of adult humor, so I wouldn't recommend for young or immature teenagers.",1423440000,,290,4.142857142857143

5539540,5,B00B04NIZO,"Much like the ""Once Upon a Time"" series, the characters are recognizable but their back stories and interactions make this a very enjoyable show. This is a light-hearted story that doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't have as much drama as ""Once Upon a Time"" and the many story archs are much shorter (there are nine episodes) so you won't be locked in to watching a multi-season series. The mix of light humor, action, and recognizable characters make this a series ahead of its time. Probably not for young children but then neither is ""Once Upon a Time""",1422662400,,561,4.73469387755102

5539582,4,B00B04NIZO,"If you've followed Once Upon A Time, this may dampen your viewing.  I thot the first episode was cartoonish by comparison.  The main characters were sometimes more appropriate for young children, but as the story and episodes continued it got better.  I almost stopped watching after the first episode, but decided to give the production a second viewing.  The story in part two improved and kept me interested.  Today, we watched the last three episodes and gave it a thumbs up.  At the current pricing, it's worth buying the mini-series and watching it from start to finish.  I think Once Upon A Time is better, but this was a good precursor.  The trolls, the prince, and wolfie still got cartoonish from time to time, but the rest of the cast was excellent, and many of the plot-lines showed imagination and creativity.  I would probably give this 4.5 stars if I could.  No probs watching this with the whole fam, the kids won't get nightmares.",1419638400,,947,4.719512195121951

At the time, my then 11-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter watched it and they were hooked as well!  We watched it so much, and they watched it with their friends so much, that the tapes wore out and/or broke.  So, when it was released on DVD I happily purchased another copy.  Unfortunately, my daughter took that copy with her to college and I so I had to buy it AGAIN!  Can you tell I'm a fan?
Just recently, my daughter (she is now 23) and I watched a marathon....7.5 hours non-stop!  And it was as wonderful this time as the first time I ever saw it.
What's really great is that every fairy tale or fairy tale character you can think of or remember has been included and woven into the story.  And even as a 54-year-old wife and mother of two, I still enjoyed all of those stories all over again.
Now, I'm purchasing it AGAIN for my 13-year-old great-niece's birthday present.
Don't hesitate....if you think you might like it, buy it.  It is sooooo WORTH the price!  Enjoy!!!",1411084800,,1110,4.258373205741627

5539709,3,B00B04NIZO,"First and foremost, parents be warned, this is not a movie for children.  Other than the fact that it is based in a fairytale setting, its content is definitely of an adult nature...a lead character with abandonment issues, a sex crazed wolf that spends the entire series trying to get in her pants, an overtly slutty Little Bo Peep, a troll father who beats his children, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  I found it alarming that some reviews say they watch this series over and over with their children.  Even in the bonus features the actors express how it's ""a fairy tale for adults.""

On the adult side of things, I bought this movie because I enjoy the fantasy genre and because it had good reviews.  I was hoping it would be something along the lines of The Princess Bride (with Robin Wright & Carey Elwes).  Unfortunately, after watching it, I honestly thought to myself ""I just wasted 7 hours of my life.""  It was pretty painful, and the only reason I kept watching it was out of a sense of morbid curiosity to see just how bad it could get.  It really says something about NBC's programming standards if they ran this more than once.

I did give it 3 stars, though, because if you're into to watching really bad movies, this one is a winner in that sense - and I mean that in sort of a complimentary way.  As far as a fairytale goes, it's pretty ""out there"" and twisted and completely unexpected and unconventional.  I probably won't watch it again, but have to say it's definitely unique.",1410220800,,1507,4.463503649635037

5539712,3,B00B04NIZO,"This is a difficult miniseries for me to rate. I like fantasy and I like action but I am not a fan of action comedies. Without a doubt this is a fantasy/ comedy miniseries. The good news is that this miniseries is 7 hours and 27 minutes long on three discs with each disc inside a separate envelope is a secure casing. So it will be well protected for years to come. I am not familiar with many in this cast but Ann Margret, John Larroquette, Rutger Hauer and Diane West are all established role players in numerous films. The story telling portions of this miniseries are great, along the lines of classics such as ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Snow White"". This is also a family friendly miniseries for most ages. The children both boys and girls will laugh and/or find portions to be very cute. My wife enjoys this miniseries but she also finds certain characters to be so silly that she believes the series would be much better without them. Unfortunately for me, there are some scenes that are just too ridiculous to enjoy (think of an exaggerated Maxwell Smart from the Get Smart TV show).  The visuals are fantastic whether it is the scenery or the costumes and the mix of ancient times with modern times are very well done.",1409529600,,1224,4.513513513513513

PROs
Great locations chosen for filming
 France: Kayserberg, Riquewihr, Turckheim, and Ungersheim
 Austria: Salzburg (3 locations) and Hallstatt
 England: 8 locations

CONs
Almost everything besides the locations

I purchased this for 3 reasons: [1] Rutger Hauer, [2] $5 for over 7 hours of potential entertainment, and [3] fantasy can be mind-bending when done properly.

Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the $5. I made it halfway thru the series before throwing in the towel. The performance by Kimberly Williams-Paisley was fine (and if you like John Larroquette, then you might be able to keep from turning it off), but at the end of the day, the 10th Kingdom is a prime example of how miserable 20th century television could be (yes, I know it was released in 2000, but it reaks of bad programming from the 1980s-90s).

Who was the target audience? A show that both parents and their children can enjoy together? Perhaps. The 10th Kingdom surely would be enjoyed by individuals with severe cognitive impairment, so if you or someone you love fits that description, then go for it.

I imagine that the actors agreed to take part in this venture and adhere to the script so that they could get a free trip to quaint filming locations in Europe. Maybe that's why the 10th Kingdom was an estimated $44M (!!)

I'm trying to think of fantasy shows/ movies worse than this one, and am drawing a blank at the moment. Stick with OUAT.",1409356800,3,1441,4.813008130081301

5539741,5,B00B04NIZO,"Already owned the original 3 disc, fat box DVD release (got it when it first came out on DVD), but had to get this because the discs are presented as the original mini series, rather than one long movie like the original release. So the beginning titles (which are awesome by the way) will be seen several times, just as if you were watching every week when it aired. I wouldn't have bought it if not for the ultra cheap cost! Though beware, it's one of those single slot stacked on top of each other discs kind of case and not a three disc case or what have you. Had to buy a three disc case so that the DVD's won't be sitting on top of each other for ever. But I'm just picky that way.

The mini series features awesome star power, Ed O'neil (aka Al Bundy from Married With Children and Jay Pritchett from Modern Family) as Relish, The Troll King, the oh so gorgeous Dianne Wiest as The Evil Queen aka Christine White, a pre Brad Paisly wife Kimberly Williams as Virginia Lewis, John Larroqutte as Anthony Lewis, Scott Cohen as Wolf and Warwick Davis as Acorn The Dwarf among other stars.",1405641600,,1090,4.317073170731708

However - two of the three discs were scratched (I purchased it brand new) and had problems playing.

5539795,1,B00B04NIZO,"One of the worst things inflicted upon the American public are productions by the Halmi family. Starting with their disaster ""Scarlett"" and up to the present day, most projects involve a mixed bag of actors, poor direction, weak writing and producers that who think they are reinventing the wheel.

This specific movie has many of the worst qualities listed. Actors mugging for the camera with no direction and a story that feels like it is being made up as it does along. They could have easily sliced 3 hours from this and made it somewhat more coherent.

Halmi family- you are no Irwin Allen! At least his productions were so bad they were good.",1394668800,6,648,4.675438596491228

5539797,3,B00B04NIZO,"Oddly I have vivid memories of seeing the part of this series where Ann-Margret appears as the 200 year old Cinderella. It may be the only part I caught in the first run but it stayed with me. It is unlikely that much of the rest of it will linger.
As a small child I loved the Grimm fairy tales in all their gothic splendor. However even the most intricately illustrated book does not have the visual impact of graphic depictions of gore and references to heinous torture in a live action film. Even the ""good guys"" are pretty barbarous by modern standards. Making a woman dance in red hot metal shoes at a wedding feast? Oh what fun!
For the most part the colors are too garish, the costumes look like they are made on the cheap, production values are middling TV, and the acting, where some fine actor like Dianne Wiest or Rutger Hauer couldn't help being nuanced, is broad enough for parody.
Overall, I am not sorry that I have seen the whole thing, even more glad that I don't have to watch it again, relieved that I can put that nagging memory of Ann-Margret in context, and planning to give it away soon.",1394496000,,1111,4.371980676328502

Well, there must be something wrong with us (wife and I), because we weren't able to make it through the first episode. The opening was very promising, but then the way over the top, way too campy acting began (especially the trolls...or whatever they were).

The line up of actors is wonderful with Ed O'Niell as the Troll King, Diane West as the Evil Queen, & John Larroquette as Tony the Maintenance Man/Man Servant. The movie stays pretty true to the fairy tale princess stories with a fun modern twist. My favorite character is the poor tormented wolf.

5539816,3,B00B04NIZO,"I thought I remembered this miniseries better, so when it came out, I bought the set.
Hmmm.
It's a fun video for younger kids (except for the innuendo and some PG-13 stuff with the daughter and ""Wolf""), but man, it was really embarrassing!
The premise described 9 kingdoms, all magical, but a hidden 10th kingdom (our world) sometimes could intersect via a mirror (you'll find that mirrors seem to be the primary magic--a little disappointing). The main characters get caught in the magical world and then obsess in trying to get back, despite the fact that the father is wanted for a third degree felony his didn't commit. They discover (spoiler!) that the evil witch is really the daughter's mother.
The only believable characters in the whole mess are the daughter and, maybe, the father. The rest are goofy, typecast, and plastic (false). ""Wolf"" was an interesting, conflicted character, and you can't help but feel for him, but his antics weren't even funny!
Buy it if you like for the kids; keep in mind that you'll want to skip over the part that Wolf and the daughter chase each other for play. The price isn't bad for a few days of entertainment, but don't think that this is going to be more than a ""head-wagging, magical train accident in slow motion.""",1391817600,,1263,4.719457013574661

5539836,5,B00B04NIZO,"""The 10th Kingdom"" is a fractured fairy tale, and it is the absolute best in my long collection of fractured fairy tales. We love the corny, cheesy, hammy acting and the adventure of the whole thing. Most of all, though, this story can make the watcher experience a wonderful range of emotions. We laughed and we cried. We ""facepalmed"" and we laughed some more. Dianne Weist is so believable as the evil queen and Kimberly Williams-Paisley is brilliant as Virginia. Scott Cohen is such a lovable ""wolf"". John Laroquette's performance is brilliant.

As I read in another review, this is a great family show. Yes, there are innuendos but they didn't make me feel like I needed to leave the room or skip through them like a lot of shows do (at which point I usually just turn something off). The older kids ""got it"" but my five-year-old son had no clue.

5539852,4,B00B04NIZO,"Since this miniseries originally aired, I've had the multi-VHS tape set. And I've watched it many, many times. So many times that I my old tape player finally chewed up some of the tapes and it wasn't really usable anymore. So often I thought ""Why didn't I buy this in DVD back in 2000?!?"" Oh right, because DVDs were just becoming mainstream, I was a poor college student, and could only watch DVDs on my roommate's computer.

Anyhow, finally getting this re-release on DVD is wonderful! This series is just as fun as I remember it. It's fantasy, but done in a funny, often tongue-in-cheek kind of way. Who wouldn't want to think their life could be transported to the world of Snow White, Cinderella, trolls, magic mirrors and other great fairy tales, just by running into a cute little dog on your way to work?

There are 3 dvds all in one box. And as long as I keep them scratch free this time, I'm sure to watch them for years to come.",1387756800,,940,4.396551724137931

I wish they had done the case a little different as the first disk is on one of those pieces that snaps in and of course it was broke when I opened it but whatever. Love the series. I haven't watch the disk yet so I can't tell you about the quality of the picture and if it's improved from when it was on VHS but for the price? Come on. I would have bought in Blu-ray and still might if they ever bother to come out in Blu-ray but either way I'm really very happy with this purchase. This series is great, I watched it when I was a teen and my niece did when she was just a kid. Of course we had to break it down as it's a mini-series and it's several hours long but that's okay. Definitely recommend it to adults, kids, and teens alike. As far as what it's about? Well I recommend watching the trailer on youtube or the like as that will help more than anything I can say.

The first and second have the best cover, disc design, and menus and the second has the best packaging overall. This new release has got a terrible new look and instead of plastic casing to hold each disc, there are three paper envelopes which leave tiny scratches when one is pulled out.

I missed the first episode, and couldn't find it on Amazon in the UK. When I saw it here and it was under $5 I was most impressed. Unfortunately it got delayed, for some reason, but Amazon refunded my shipping costs, which were 200% of the initial cost of the product. It didn't fix things but it was a nice gesture.

Eventually it came a couple of weeks later. The packaging was interesting, like record sleeves, and I found it a little tricky to get the discs out. It was also good to see how it all began, but after watching a recent similar show (""Once Upon A Time"") it's easy to see how dated this is.

The effects are cute, and the story too, but - maybe it's because I'm growing up, but it's 4x3 format (full frame) and it's on DVD, maybe if my DVD player had been able to upscale it it might have seemed more impressive.

Nevertheless for the price it can't be beat, a nice trip down memory lane, and I found it very enjoyable to watch. The one thing that was lacking was the special features, or feature rather.",1380672000,,1133,4.211981566820277

It could be just a poor script & bad dialogue. There's an over-the-top werewolf that howls and acts like a horny toad, the trolls are goofy and stupid and stumble around and act like clueless, inner-city gangsters, plus there's a talking dog that's really third-rate, etc. The dialogue is atrocious; it's over-acted and just bad, bad, film-making. Reminds me of a late-night B movie that would make you groan. It may have an all-star cast (that's what tricked me; tons of award winners and I like fantasy & it had good reviews) plus it has a lot of disks (7+ hours) so seemed like a good value, but we couldn't even make it past 1-2 hours of the film. Kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It's not even good for kids, as the heroine's father uses profanity (""kiss my ass,"" etc.) and has a magic fridge with beer falling out of it, etc. and other things that wouldn't really be good for kids. I own top-notch fantasy/action like Lord of the Rings, Matrix, X-Men, Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Dune, Chronicles of Riddick, Chronicles of Narnia, and many more.

Don't get me wrong, it is not awful, it just isn't great.  The acting is *extremely* heavy handed, across the board, often so much so that it pulled me right out of the story.  Once again, don't get me wrong, not saying the actors are not talented.  They were ALL hamming it up and overacting which means it is a direction issue not an actor issue.

I also find myself astounded that apparently no one has an issue with the plot.  (Spoilers)

One of the main story lines is that Virginia is too uptight and not trusting because of her desertion by her mother when she was a child.  OK, I am cool with that.  I am not cool with the idea her not having a boyfriend at the ripe old age of 22 is ""bad"".  I am not cool with the ""resolution"" of her issues being for her to have unprotected sex and end up pregnant by a man who has demonstrated time and time again that he is not very bright and has difficulty being decisive, reliable, or trustworthy.  Wolfy is not a character you want anywhere near your daughter.  Ever.  Yes, I know, he rushed in to save the day on the mushroom island, and helps defeat the evil queen in the end.  But his motives were still entirely selfish; it's all about him.  His character does not grow up, at all.  Throughout the whole series I knew the two were going to end up together, and the whole time I kept thinking, ""She can't really fall for this loser, can she?""  Or ""How are they going to make Wolfy someone a grown intelligent woman should want to be with?""  Ladies, before you get all up in arms ask yourself if you would even date a guy like Wolfy, I mean really.  Seriously, some of you probably have and regret it.

The troll children were good comic relief, but I am glad they spent a while as a statue.

The best performances were by Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Daniel Lapaine.  I especially liked the shepherdess competition.  The other characters pretty much remained one dimensional throughout the seven hours.  Once again not the actors; the direction or writing or both.  Rutger Hauer is one of my favorite actors, and there is no question that he is a great actor, but you would not know that from watching ""The Tenth Kingdom"".

The opening credits are amazing, and I was not surprised to find they won an Emmy.  Ms. Stockley has an amazing and beautiful voice.  I actually went look to find the ""whole"" song from the opening and was quite disappointed to learn that what you hear in the credits is the whole song.

I give it three stars, and I think that is generous.  It is a pleasant diversion (especially if you spread it over a couple days), but Tolkien it is not.",1377302400,11,2744,4.365612648221344

I don't think any one realized at the time this would start a chain reaction that is still affecting our movie and television watching today. There have been so many fairy tale movies and t.v shows in the last 13 yrs but this one was the first I remember being so excited to see!!!,1375833600,,340,4.166666666666667

5539917,4,B00B04NIZO,This is different than what I was thinking it would be.  But it is really a good show.  I would buy it for a friend.,1375660800,,116,3.6
5539918,5,B00B04NIZO,"Love the show!  It is truly one of my favorites!  The DVD itself was just a standard DVD, nothing special, kind of underwhelming after my friend had the full box set, but the show is still the same... AMAZING!",1375488000,5,209,4.333333333333333

Other than that, great product.",1374192000,21,352,4.4375

5539927,5,B00B04NIZO,"I found this miniseries by accident on VHS, which finally wore out. After a lot of searching and waiting, this DVD finally became available at a reasonable price. Hooray! I enjoy the quirky offbeat characters and since the actors took their roles seriously the whole production came out extremely believable. It's a reinvented fairy tale for grownups. I loved the characters and the interesting plot line, (and the lack of blood and gore.) It's fun, not frightening. So grab the popcorn and enjoy!",1373328000,,497,5.0

5539929,5,B00B04NIZO,"The 10th Kingdom was such a spectacular miniseries in 2000. It's where I feel everyone fell in the with Wolf (Scott Cohen, whose career I faithfully follow)! The fairy tale magic, the evil queen, the story of love, the adventure of eluding bad guys & sometimes not knowing who the bad guys are, the twists & turns of a plot so captivating. I truly am so happy & excited to finally own a DVD of my favorite miniseries! The DVD has always been so expensive. I don't mind that there are 3 discs & commercial breaks are obvious. I finally own The 10th Kingdom! It has something for everyone! When it first came out on TV, I was afraid my husband would write it off as a ""chick movie."" Oh no. Not this miniseries! My husband enjoys it as much as I do. A plus is I have been able to show it to my teenagers (a boy & girl). Both of them fell in love with the miniseries. It was great to watch them as the story unfolds. They kept talking to the TV to get Tony to move, Virginia to fight back, Wolf to be the good guy. It was even more fun to watch them as I went back to The 10th Kingdom. The only complaint any of us have - is there wasn't a sequel! We all want, no need, to know what happened to Virginia & Wolf! Buy this miniseries & it will not disappoint!",1372723200,4,1253,4.016

5539933,4,B00B04NIZO,This is a great mini series. I fell in love with it years ago and have been searching for it on DVD for a long time. The only downside to this DVD set is the packaging which is a 3 disc set inside those paper DVD cases inside a regular DVD case. Its kind of a pain to deal with but other than that I love this.,1372118400,,310,3.6417910447761193

5539941,2,B00B04NIZO,This miniseries had just enough interest to keep me going. The direction of the characters was way too broad and seemed aimed more at children despite the generally adult themes. The series did have good production values and its intended comic pieces were sometimes actually not bad. There was just enough of interest to get me all the way through to its slightly unexpected finale.,1370995200,3,383,4.907692307692308

When I found it at Amazon at a very reasonable price, I purchased it as a surprise for my grandchildren. They told the children in my neighborhood about it and we had movie day.

5539951,5,B00B04NIZO,I loved this show. It's really corny and a wonderful escapist romp. Scott Cohen is a real ham and plays the wolf perfectly.,1368144000,,123,4.391304347826087
5539952,5,B00B04NIZO,"This is not your usual fairy tale.. it's a fractured fairy tale/ epic adventure gone entirely wrong, yet so very right.

5539954,5,B00B04NIZO,"If you love(d) fairy tales this will transport you there! Then you will yearn for more. I loved this on the TV event in 1999  & got the mail order VHS from the TV offer during the showing.  We wore it out, because there is so much flowing storyline going in several directions at once (but with great continuity) AND my 9 and 5 year old (at the time) wanted to see it a lot.  There were favorite scenes that caused a lot of fast forwarding and rewinding.  Which helped along the destruction I am sure!  I ordered this in VHS, DVD and a copy of the book that came out to be packaged with the VHS after the initial run and 'Order Now!' time period advertised during the television 'event'.  The DVD is a nice change in usefulness, the bloopers are great and the ""Making Of"" piece is nicely done, interesting and beautiful with information on the locations used.  You WILL want to 'Be There, Do That"" In the same way I have wanted (to this day) to open the wardrobe door, put on an old fur coat , step out  into falling snow and meet a faun named  Mr. Tumnis!  GET IT and be transported!",1367971200,,1084,4.193236714975845

5539956,4,B00B04NIZO,"I love the show, it came in perfect condition, and came very quickly. My only critsizms would be that the packaging was somewhat cheap- the three DVDS were in paper and plastic sleeves with a square holder in the case. There was only one extra, but that should probably be expected given that show was made before DVDs were popular. All in all, I was really happy with it.",1367452800,,372,4.405797101449275
5539957,5,B00B04NIZO,"The 10th Kingdom is one of my favorite mini-series along with Alice and Tin Man! The 10th Kingdom has it all! It's romantic, funny, adventuresome, and a theme of good vs evil. It's awesome!",1367280000,,189,4.588235294117647
5539958,5,B00B04NIZO,I originally saw this when it was on NBC several years ago.  It's great!!  My two daughters fight over it!!!,1367020800,,108,4.35
5539959,5,B00B04NIZO,"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful.",1366848000,,1463,4.7936507936507935
5539960,5,B00B04NIZO,"The whole mini series is in a three disc set, combined in a case the size of a normal DVD case. A tale that starts in New York City and then gets pulled into a land full of Fairy Tales thanks to an interesting twist.  I would have loved to see a sequel.",1366848000,,253,3.7735849056603774
5539961,4,B00B04NIZO,I remember watching this series when I was younger and in middle school. I continue to love this series....This reminds me of the pre series to Once Upon A Time. I think the only thing that has bothered me was that there are scenes that appear tacky and how this series has the theme song before each episode.,1366761600,2,309,4.344827586206897
5539962,5,B00B04NIZO,I was nervous when I went to buy this because the price was alot lower than I had seen it on other sites. I had also read reviews from other similar dvd sets saying that the movie had been missing chunks from the original show. However with this that was not the case. Every scene was shown perfectly.,1366588800,,301,4.206896551724138

The cast is great!  The script takes the old Fairy Tales and gives them a little twist - my favorite was the evil Peep family who stole the water from the town Wishing Well and took the magic for themselves.  You will recognize your old Faves - almost.  Trolls, Witches, Magic and  Wolfy, who is almost human and completely charming, is an unlikely hero.  John Laroquette is at his best with his terrible Magic Wishes as he bumbles his way through the movie.  Scott Cohen as Wolfy is wonderful - is he good, is he bad? He could go either way - especially when the moon is full!  We were so sad when it ended without a sequel!  What happens next?  We need to know!",1366329600,2,838,4.234177215189874

I was glad to be able to purchase it on dvd because i remember it was overly long watching it with all the commercial interruptions. I found it to be very funny at times, silly at times, a little risque at times, a little slow moving at times, and a little confusing at times. The locations used in the filming were breathtaking and the sets were fabulous. The ""Wolf"" characters gestures made the movie for me. Fun to watch, if you're in to fairy tales.",1366156800,,524,4.25

I remembered that I had really liked it when I saw it on the tube so purchased it.  I was not disappointed.  This film has held up well over the last thirteen years.  Even the CGI  still looks good.  I believe that the CGI still works because it enhances rather than dominates the film.  I want a ring that sings.  This is a modern adult fairy tale with lots of clever twists on the old stories we all grew up with.  The characters are well written and played by and outstanding cast in some fine costumes and imaginative makeup. The trolls are abfab baddies.  The tooth fairy is a dentist.  People in this tale are a complete.  No one is simply good or evil.  Queens, princes, trolls, wolves all have a flip side.  This series is much better than the current crop of fairy tale knock offs.  I highly recommend this film to an audience of adults and older teens.  If you have no other reason to buy this film get it for the opening credits that turn New York City into fairyland.  Since the film was made in 2000 you can still see the World Trade Center in the credits.  I was so glad to reacquaint myself with this movie.",1365984000,,1229,4.273913043478261

5539979,1,B00B04NIZO,"This movie will make children and adults even more stupid than the indoctrination of the public school system in USA. It reflects life in NY City. It cannot compare to quality classic movies such as the Wizard of OZ or Alice in Wonderland of Walt Disney. The heroes of this movie are not real heroes with character, but vapid idiots reflecting Mayor Bloomberg's artificial world of NY City, completely out of touch with all parts of the country. There are 3 DVDs and after watching 20 minutes of the first one I realized that it was not a reflection of the fairy tales as you could read from literature, but characters who conducted themselves in childish behavior. The movie does not offer needed heroes for children. For example, the father of the heroine has 7 wishes and asks for an unlimited supply of beer and other trivial wishes. If a father figure for a child is this man, lookout for the unlucky child!",1365033600,6,912,4.601226993865031

To my disappointment, by the time I had come to look for it online, it was out of print and very hard to find (or extremely pricey!!) I stumbled on this set after losing most of my hope. The price was good, so I bought it. Expecing to only contain one disc from the series...and to my great surprise, there was all three discs, brand new, and set up for my region of viewing... it was flawless and unexpected and UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP in comparison to others (including if you are buying the discs one by one!!)

That's how bad it was. The script leaves a lot to be desired. The plot or story line is extremely disconnected. I think that it was made for children, not for adults...just a thought in my efforts to try to find a reason for this monumental failure...a terrible waste of money!",1364860800,6,451,4.445783132530121

5539983,5,B00B04NIZO,"Before One Upon A Time magically dazzled the television screens, there was an underrated miniseries called The 10th Kingdom that aired in five-parts on NBC in February 2000. With a stunning cast with Diane West, Ed O'Neill, Camryn Manheim, John Larroquette, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Ann-Margret, Rutger Hauer, and Scott Cohen, one would think this lavish event would be a ratings goldmine, but sadly it received low-ratings despite the fact that it garnered good reviews from critics and viewers.

The miniseries was previously released onto a single VHS, a two tapes VHS set (several scenes were removed), a three disc DVD set, and later a single double-sided DVD, all which are out-of-print. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released a three disc DVD set of The 10th Kingdom, in which I received a free copy in exchange for my honest review.

The 10th Kingdom's plot twisted the classic fairy tales. In the opening, the Evil Queen escapes prison and turns Prince Wendell (the Queen's stepson and the grandson of the late Snow White) into a dog, who quickly escapes through a magic mirror and ends up in modern day New York. The Queen sends Wolf and three trolls after him. The Prince quickly crosses path with a young waitress, Virginia Lewis, along with her janitor father, Anthony Lewis. The Wolf's plans of capturing the prince comes to a halt when he lays eyes on the lovely Virginia, who he instantly falls madly in love with her. He joins Virginia, Anthony, and the Prince when they are forced to into the magic mirror and travel to the Nine Kingdoms. Many dangers and mysteries await them as they try to defeat the wicked queen, restore the Prince back into his body, and find a way home.

I watched The 10th Kingdom when it originally aired and I loved it. I bought the single VHS version, but the video quality was horrible. I was thrilled to get a chance to review the DVD version. Over the last few nights I have watched the entire miniseries and it is just as good as I remember it. My favorite is the part 3 with Lucy Punch as Sally Peep, but I also like everything else about it. As a bonus there is a Making-of Featurette. The video quality is great, except for the twenty-odd-seconds of waviness in the part one scene with Virginia and the Prince in the restaurant's kitchen, but it didn't persuade me from not giving this DVD release a 5 out of 5.",1364601600,,2369,4.676258992805756
5539984,4,B00B04NIZO,"I was so happy when I saw this was on DVD! I've been wanting it forever. And this version has at least an additional hour of cut footage that isn't available on the VHS or seen on TV, and though it doesn't change the story line it adds to a few holes. The picture quality is amazing and is instantly recognizable from the DVD. The only thing that could be better about this is if it was one disc. This series is separated on three discs and 5 sections, making it a very small inconvenience when watching all the way through, but fantastic if you can't and want to pick up somewhere in the middle. No more Rewinding =)",1364515200,,617,4.19327731092437
5539985,5,B00B04NIZO,This has been a family favorite since it first aired on television years ago.  It was the movie my daughter always wanted to watch when she was stuck in bed feeling under the weather.  She's 22 now and still loves it as much as she ever did and will be thrilled to have a copy of her very own.,1364169600,,293,3.9491525423728815
5539986,4,B00B04NIZO,"I've owned the original ""10th Kingdom"" DVD set for more than 10 years now and have watched it many times, so I mainly bought this newer 2013 edition as a back up (because at such a low cost, why not?). I've run through the discs to see if there are any differences in this new edition, and yes, there are some differences.
The main thing that I noticed right away is the presentation of the episodes: in the original DVD set, there where 3 discs, with the opening titles at the beginning of the first disc only, and the mini-series was presented as one, very long movie. In this new set, there are still three discs, but the story is presented in the way they were aired - as 5 separate parts. I personally would have liked the mini-series to be presented the same way as the older DVDs, but at least this new set allows the viewer to enjoy the opening titles with each episode (and those titles are amazing, I doubt anyone'd get sick of it).
The Special Features in the new set are fewer than the older set, but really, that won't matter much. The 20 minute making-of featurette is identical in both editions (it appears to have been a promo for the mini-series on NBC) and it's got some fun bloopers and such - It was the only special feature worth viewing on the old DVD set, so you really aren't missing out on anything here. The featurette is on the last disc instead of the first, but is not labeled at all.
The menu screens are fairly simple, containing the chapter selections (there are surprisingly few - about 6 chapters per 1.5 hour episode) and the 2 episodes.
The packaging is why I gave this item four stars. It is the most unusual DVD case I've seen. The case is the size of an average single DVD case, which is great, but the discs are held in separate paper sleeves, which are housed in a squarish plastic mold that holds the sleeve corners. You'll have to be pretty careful with the sleeve because if the corners get worn or flimsy, the plastic case will do no good. I really don't understand the logic here.

Overall, I definitely recommend this DVD set. It's a great deal for a 7-and-a-half hour adventure with comedy, drama, a few scares, and a romance fit for a fairy tale. You can't beat the price, and the whole thing is pretty family appropriate (see other reviews for more details on content). It's presented in Full-Screen (it was made for TV, so there probably won't ever be a Wide-Screen release), and the picture is clear.
The main plot is about a young woman and her dad after they magically travel to a land where the classic fairy tales actually happened. They try to find their way back home, but they've got a prince who was transformed into a dog as their companion, a half-wolf who's loyalties are complicated, and a mercenary hunter after them all. If you like modern storytelling with throwbacks to classic fairy and folk tales - complete with an evil stepmother! - you'll love this movie!

UPDATE: I reviewed the picture quality of a certain scene to answer a question in the comments, and the picture quality seems to be pretty good for a DVD (I played it in my BluRay player on a high-def screen), but in doing so, I realized two things, both negative.
First, the packaging is annoying! What I thought at first was just unusual has become frustrating and tedious. Switching discs is cumbersome, and without good lighting, good luck getting everything in/out of the sleeves and case.
Second, I was trying to jump to a scene on disc one, Part Two, by using the scene selection feature, but it turns out that selecting any scene from Part Two would take you to the same scene number, but in Part One! I was trying to get to the Snow White Cottage scene, but would be taken to the prison scenes from the other episode... Seemed a bit of a sloppy mistake, but one that would probably never really hinder your enjoyment of the show.

I have decided that I actually prefer the layout on the old set, where the whole miniseries is presented as one long movie, rather than this newer set's presentation of each episode separately. For newcomers to the series or the DVD, this won't matter at all, so if you're in doubt, the pros outnumber the cons - Buy it!",1364169600,217,4190,4.453125
5539987,5,B00B04NIZO,"I loved this on TV, I have the Video cassest version, and NOW I have the DVD.  This is a wonderful series to watch, and my daughter watches it everytime she is sick - stuck on the couch recovering and enjoying this lively story.

I HIGHLY recommend it - It's Funny, Touching, and has a cute twist on the well known fairy tales.",1364169600,,327,4.174603174603175
5539988,5,B00B04NIZO,"I watch this epic at least once a year.  When I watch it again, there's always something that entertains me that I'd forgotten.  There is some tongue in cheek dialogue and story lines.  It does take some thinking to remember all the fairy tale characters involved because they aren't quite as ""good"" as in the stories we were told as children.  Actors are believable in their roles and I'm always glad I watched it.  That's why I traded in my video for a DVD version.",1363996800,,467,4.447058823529412
5539989,5,B00B04NIZO,"Until the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, this movie may have been the most complex fantasy ever attempted.  In some ways the story rambles, but the intricate elements are woven together so coherently that they smoothly fit into the quest undertaken by the principal characters.

Virginia and her father Tony Lewis (Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette) live in a New York apartment.  One day a dog enters Virginia's life.  However, the dog is not just any ordinary dog, but Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine) changed into a dog by an evil Queen (Dianne Wiest).  Soon trolls enter the picture along with magic, and the story is launched.

Virginia and Tony travel through a magic mirror into the land of the nine kingdoms (with New York being the 10th kingdom).  It takes Virginia and Tony little time to realize that the world they have entered has very different rules from their own.  Their goal is to find a mirror that will allow them to travel back to their own world; the quest for the mirror forms the heart of the story.

As Virginia and Tony seek for a way back, they are both are on a voyage of discovery about themselves, though Virginia has much more to learn about her life than Tony does about his.  Through a series of vignettes they learn the history of the nine kingdoms, and learn there are mysteries related to that history.  One of the most startling revelations is that Virginia and Tony are somehow involved in the nine kingdoms, but it's not until we get well into the movie that we understand the nature of their involvement.

The plot is generally coherent and I had little trouble keeping track of the parallel stories.  I admit that there were a few things that confused me when I watched the story in its original television debut, but my confusion was cleared up by watching the DVD version without the commercials and all in one 7+ hour sitting.

The acting talent in this movie is phenomenal.  Rutger Hauer plays the Queen's woodsman, with his own poignant story.  Warwick Davis is Acorn, a criminal with a tongue-in-cheek character.  Ed O'Neil is perfect as Relish the Troll King.  Scott Cohen as Wolf took a little getting used to, but once I realized how he fit into the story I enjoyed his antics and characterization.  Camryn Manheim makes an interesting Snow White.  Ann-Margret brings class to Queen Cinderella.  This list is but a fraction of the cast possible by the epic nature of this movie.

The story is an adult fairy tale.  This movie includes violence, intense scenes, and some sexual content that is likely inappropriate for children below the age of 7 or 8 and perhaps for some older children.  However, for everyone else this movie is fun and complicated.  If you enjoy fantasy, and you can be open-minded about how fantasy is approached, this movie could be perfect for you.",1363824000,33,2822,4.69857433808554
5539990,4,B00B04NIZO,"From talking mirrors to magic beans, werewolves, wishing wells, and troll dust, The 10th Kingdom is an experience you'll never forget. With an all-star cast, incredible special effects by Artisan and a truly unique premise, this modern-day fairy tale will cast a spell over the entire family. It involves laughter, tears, many valuable lessons, and a shocking plot twist. This kind of modern blend between The Princess Bride and Snow White hasn't been successfully done until now... but Hallmark pulls it off with kid gloves.

Perky, blue-eyed Virginia Lewis (Kimberly Williams) lives on the edge of Central Park within biking distance of her workplace, a half-rate diner where she spends most of her time. Her father Anthony (John Larroquette), once a successful businessman, is now an underpaid, overworked and often ill-treated janitor at their apartment building. The two share a boring existence, barely standing one another and desiring for a more exciting life. Virginia has resigned herself to the fact that this desire will never come true... but little does she know the adventure that is about to envelope them all in mystery, magic, and danger. The 9 Kingdoms have lived in peace since the imprisonment of the Evil Queen, Prince Wendell White's stepmother. But with the young and selfish prince's coronation forthcoming, he has been asked to make the rounds of his province, including a routine visit to the prison. The Queen (Dianne Wiest) has awaited this moment and formulates a daring plan with the aid of the Troll King.

Wendell's manservant is murdered and the prince himself is imprisoned in the body of a dog, stripped of his rights and his voice. In his place, the Queen places an imposter... her doggy friend (Daniel Lapaine). But her plans go terribly wrong when the dog manages to escape into the cellars, and from there through a magic mirror into modern-day New York. After him she sends Burley, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, along with one of the prison inmates, a werewolf imprisoned for 'sheep worrying' (played by Scott Cohen). Prince leaps out of the mirror into the Park at the precise moment Virginia speeds by on her bike. There is a violent collision and she takes the dog with her to work, little knowing a pack of strange magical creatures will soon be on her trail. After that point, strange things begin to happen to Virginia... from a dog that seems to want to tell her something to three trolls who invade her home, terrorize her father, and steal her shoes, and even to a insane guy who breaks into her grandma's apartment and tries to cook her.

Through a series of comical and unexplainable events, Virginia, Tony, and Prince are forced to flee through the mirror and into the 9 Kingdoms where nothing is as it seems... talking mushrooms, wishing wells, invisibility shoes, poisoned apples, talking birds, evil huntsmen, and fairy-tale creatures run rampant, from a 200-year-old Cinderella to the Tooth Fairy. Unknown to all, the Queen has continued with her plans to overthrow the kingdom, seizing the magic mirrors that once belonged to Snow White's evil stepmother. Through them she can rule the world, and continue where her predecessor left off: by destroying the House of White. All Virginia wants to do is return to her normal life in New York, but each step takes them further from the mirror and deeper into this imperial intrigue. Although she and Tony may believe their only duty is to locate the mirror once more, they are in reality being guided by an unseen force... and their destiny is tied to that of Prince Wendell and his evil stepmother.

It has suddenly become a dangerous game of hidden priorities and Virginia must learn to trust her instincts as they are joined by Wolf. Someone or something is keeping them safe from the Evil Queen, but it cannot last forever. Magic, mayhem, and mystery abound in this eight-hour television epic who now has one of the largest followings of any miniseries ever produced. The story is alive with myth, humor, and surprisingly two-dimensional characters while packing every gag, fairy tale character, and pun ever invented into a hilariously amusing story with a surprisingly dynamic climax. If you can't see the humor in the werewolves, elves, fairies, trolls, dwarves and blind woodsmen that traipse across the screen, you won't understand the messages that the film also has to offer about family, friendship, loving compassion, and forgiveness.

There are numerous scenes involving a huntsman whose arrows never fail to pierce the heart of a living creature. People are killed by arrows, knifed, attacked by trolls, physically abused with punches and kicks, and poisoned. There are several instances where violence is hinted at but not seen. One chilling instance of a character's past is revealed in which a parent attempted to purposely drown them as a child; this may arouse further caution in wary viewers, since it pits child against parent, which in turn involves some emotionally-intense scenes and pieces of dialogue. Language is mild but does include minor abuses of deity. There is some sensuality played through innuendos, a suggestive shepherdess, and a scene handled delicately in the woods where two characters tousle. They giggle, nip, and roll around before the camera cuts out, returning to find them straggling into camp disheveled and exhausted. (Later one implies they'll have to get married to give their child a proper upbringing.) The first hour in New York is the most squeamish content-wise thanks to Tony, but if you can get past that, you've cleared the most major hurtle. Magic is made much of but is usually on the side of evil. Wolf makes one thought-provoking remark about magic: 'The more you use it, the more you want it.'

Viewers should also be aware of several scenes that may frighten or concern younger children. Virginia, Tony, and Wolf have their fortunes told by a gypsy, but the tables turn when the old woman then purposefully places a curse on the heroine. The Queen seeks guidance from Snow White's evil stepmother by visiting her grave. (Whether or not the former Evil Queen is actually dead or not is unknown; but she does move on occasion and speak.) There are numerous instances where the characters are attacked unexpectedly, and lives are placed in peril. (To be fair, most of these scenes are also laced with irony and laugh-aloud humor.) I liked the production for more than just amazing special effects, a dozen laughs a minute, and some memorable characters. The premise appealed to me merely for the psychological struggle that went on in each of the characters. For Virginia it's a painful loss from her childhood. For Tony it's realizing where he has failed at being a father. For Wolf it's choosing the path of right or wrong and perhaps sacrificing himself in the process. And Prince learns the true meaning of leadership and responsibility. Even the Queen has a few things to face. The humor lightens what is in actuality a very deep and emotional drama flowing under the pretense of fairy tale likeness.

The production is a captivating and highly entertaining saga of mystery, magic, and romance that actually leaves you with something to think about. Hidden beneath the silliness are true lessons about learning to trust yourself and others, forgiveness, not fleeing from your problems, and being courageous even when the stakes are down. Now that's magic.",1363824000,,7423,4.981451612903226
