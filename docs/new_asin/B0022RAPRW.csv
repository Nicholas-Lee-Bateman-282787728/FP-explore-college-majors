8349680,5,B0022RAPRW,This movie has a non-lineal styles mixing pass and present in a way that reminds me 21 Grams.  A deep drama with outstanding acting.,1466467200,,132,4.5
8349681,4,B0022RAPRW,"Typical European dark comedy. Recommended for adults only, lots of drugs, sex, and death.",1445385600,2,89,5.428571428571429
8349682,5,B0022RAPRW,"This movie is an expose more than a stereotype.  While not all Finns represent the unflinching look at alcoholism, apathy, and psychiatric instability, it's equally true that not all Americans are irresponsible, uneducated, pill popping unfit parents.  Portrayals like these give you a look into the parts of a given society that are never printed on a brochure.  The unfortunate events in the film lead back to a selfish, quasi-predatorial junkie.  Who, in the end is able to appear innocent. An entire family is destroyed and people suffer needlessly, or do they?  Based on Tolstoy, it is more firmly rooted in the dark side of The Eastern European experience that everyone wants to dismiss but should be discussed.  Wonderful but difficult to watch.",1363564800,,752,5.073170731707317
