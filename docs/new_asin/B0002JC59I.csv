8028209,4,B0002JC59I,"This is a retro-look of the 60s counterculture movement set in China as if the acid rock movement delayed arrival by three decades to the East, told through the eyes of two drifters, each of a different class but with a single desire to find themselves. The creative camera work depicts the chaotic, frantic impulses driving the participants; one group, the band of drifting rock musicians looking for the first big contract, the other a lost songwriter desiring to lose himself to the forces, study and analyze them while going 'underground' to escape the establishment expectations of affluence in his home in Beijing. Daniel Wu plays a wealthy, 'preppie' songwriter who hitches his star to the rebellious band (a captivating Shu qi helps), lead by Geng Le (as Road) and his tagalong girlfriend, Shu Qi (as Yan Yin) who says little in the first hour but shimmers anyway in this B-look at rebellion and free expression. I enjoyed this look at dreamers trying to catch the James Dean/Jack Koureac currents to success. It all ends too abruptly as if to avoid a weak denouement, leaving a sketchy romance between Wu and Shu Qi hanging. I enjoyed the carefree, drifting bandmates until the finish, wishing for a climactic ""Purple Rain"" finish. And so, you are left at the edge of a cliff. An alternative ending fails to explain the dissipating story. When Daniel Wu captured his infatuation moments with Shu Qi on camera that was fine with me, so full of visual charm, in desperate need for a musical lift. Sadly, the producers made no musical shift to provide sufficient story thrust to conclusion. Yet there was one scene that could have been pivotal to that shift, when 'Road' quits the band and for just a moment the band shifts into an upbeat number. But, for whatever reason, the band stayed downbeat and uninspired. Until Hollywood does something substantial with this diamond among sand pebbles (Shu Qi) they are relegating talent to mere stage props for cultural reasons. I give the story 3 stars but Shu Qi 6 for sparkling anyway until the script ran out.",1396310400,,2062,4.811267605633803

Interesting but scattered  4*

As the film opens, we see Michael [Daniel Wu] being driven in a taxi or limo through Beijing, with stereotypical Chinese music soundtrack and travelogue-style images of touristy Chinese life.  The impression given is certainly that he is just arriving in the city, though given the music-video style and structure of the film it's hard to say for sure.  If so, the next scene is some time later, when Michael is at a nightclub with a band onstage led by a long haired, bare-chested singer, and a blonde-wigged dancer / hanger on.  For no apparent reason the manager has the singer's mic cut off, he objects forcefully, and an argument then brawl ensues.  Yoiks! the fuzz is called, and the band (and blonde) make their escape ... on bicycles! [Er, what happened to their equipment?]

Michael then talks to the camera, and tells a bit of his story.  Raised in Hong Kong and the US, both his ""Chinese"" [by this does he mean Mandarin? Cantonese is the major dialect in HK.] and English are poor, and his father brought him to Beijing to improve his Mandarin and make connections.  The father is a ""builder"", a big shot in HK [and obviously with influence in Beijing also].  Michael has aspirations as a singer/songwriter, but little success so far.  He has been involved in a mysterious incident in a poolhall and has to remain in China until his court date.

Next thing, Michael runs into the band at an outdoor restaurant, still carrying a pair of drumsticks he picked up at the imbroglio.  Introductions are made -- the band is Moonwatchers, the singer is ""Road,"" the girl is Yang Yin, Road's girlfriiend and a dancer for ""The Glorious Sun Dog"", and each member gives a mini-bio, an interesting and varied crew.  Michael ingratiates himself, and is adopted as a sort of mascot, but also distanced, not taken seriously, because of his silver-spoon, foreign origins.

One day Michael follows an advertising truck to The Glorious Sun Dog, a sort of carny or travelling vaudeville outfit, and during Yang Yin's act (a ""striptease"" in which nothing much comes off.  sorry, guys!) she starts a fight with a heckler and winds up at the police station.  Aha, we see a pattern here!  the feisty temperaments of Road and Yang Yin both bring them together passionately and cause inevitable friction which drives them apart.

The Glorious Sun Dog goes on tour, and Moonwatchers goes with them to help pay off Yang Yin's fine.  Michael wangles his way into the band and onto the tour.  And inevitably Michael begins to fall for Yang Yin ... well, what sefl-destructive young man wouldn't?  She's beautiful, has a gaeity and playfullness that entice, and at the same time an underlying pathos that brings out the protective instinct.  And thus ends the setup.  How will Michael's legal troubles work out?  What will happen with his, and with Road's, musical careers?  How will the triangle between the three resolve?

The acting is by and large excellent.  Geng Le adds both charisma and nuance to the role of Road.  Shu Qi is perfect as the wild, upbeat mother hen with a bruised core. The rest of the band members are sharply defined, and it's too bad they don't get more script.  Daniel Wu is subdued and low affect as Michael -- maybe that's just the character as written, but he could have been more interesting, made us care more.  The music is not bad, both Moonwatchers and the other band or two we see in the background (without speaking Mandarin, it's hard to judge Road's lyrics -- are we supposed to see a progression from rather silly and forced to actually pretty good? or is that just in translation?), and the street and bar scenes provide an interesting view of non-tourist Beijing.  The relation between the three main characters is well done, and each has a backstory (though to some extent these seem kind of forced).

But the the major event of the end game is also forced, not flowing from the plot but just happens.  Neither of the endings (there is an alternate ending extra) really provide much in the way of resolution, just a rushed sort of winding down. Also, the story of Michael's poolhall incident is dragged out in snippets throughout the film, a conceit which is inobvious until near the end and which hardly seems to add much, much less be necessary -- when we find out what really happened it doesn't change our perception of the main thread of action, nor would it have hurt to know much earlier, in a simple flashback say or even as the introduction of the film  But what really causes me to back off from 5* to 4* on this one is the style, or maybe lack of consistent style.  The film doesn't seem to know whether it's a music video with a DIY handheld consumer cam aesthetic, a travelogue, or a straight narrative feature, and comes across as a disordered hodgepodge of effects, kind of like the newsletter with twenty fonts produced by someone on their first word processor outing.  As with the poolhall incident thread, too much seems done for effect, because it could be done, not to communicate.

So, in summary, worth seeing for a well conceived core story, the acting of Geng Le and Shu Qi, and the Beijing setting.  But unfortunately diminished by an inconsistent style, some unclarity of the time line, and a rather forced, tacked on, ending.",1217894400,,5370,4.7005347593582885
8028211,5,B0002JC59I,"A son of a Hong Kong tycoon moved to mainland China attracted with local Western-style rock band tunes to escape from a father's shadow and establish himself as a self-made-man. Accepted by rockers, travels and works with musicians, experiencing personal matters and witnessing strange realities of newly re-united country.

Probably, by so common in rockers' environment motorbike incident (in 1992 Victor Tsoj of Russia, more known regionally among these tragedies) having a death of an innovative band front-man inflicted, an idea of impossibility to speedily modernize a huge populated country is somehow being attempted.

Relatively young age of characters-twenty-twenty five years-allows suggestion that a next movie sequence will reflect a fulfillingly-developed careers of talents in new China, in spite tragedies they overcame at the century fall.

Personally, I like this movie for a vibrant, youth-optimistic, sexy saturation it spreads around.",1189641600,,955,5.807142857142857
