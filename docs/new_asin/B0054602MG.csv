4560860,3,B0054602MG,"I will say I never saw the first movie. I was confused as this movie assumes that you did see the first installment. I was asking basic questions such as ""Who is Chromeskull? Why is Chromeskull? Why does he kill? What is this organization behind him?"" I felt behind and found myself going back through scenes to see if there was something I missed.

Once I got over that, I have to ask...Seriously. If you are going to kidnap someone, wouldn't you think about checking them for a cell phone before you lock them up?
The cops have various clues and leads and are hunting down Chromeskull as he, or I should say his slightly inept apprentice, prepares his next victim.

If you watched the first one, and made it through 5 or so Saw movies, you don't need to be reading reviews, you know you are going to watch it anyway. If you haven't seen the first one, I would recommend watching it before attempting to watch this one.

4560862,5,B0054602MG,"If you liked the first, you will probably enjoy this one as well. Fantastic gore effects and a good movie to top it off. I recommend this to any slasher movie fan!",1316649600,,163,4.125
4560863,3,B0054602MG,"Horror movies, especially slashers, have always been a huge guilty pleasure for me. It probably has something to do with growing up with them and being terrified of the Jason Voorhees, the Michael Myers, and the Freddy Kreugers at a young age. Most of these horror movies were made during a time when horror was still scary. And sure, fifteen to twenty years later, these movies are more than a little cheesy and you laugh at the fact you were ever scared of them to begin with, but it's that nostalgic factor. Deep down you still have that feeling of terror, of respect, and of admiration. ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 attempts to tap into that sense of nostalgia and mostly succeeds.

Laid to Rest 2 picks up immediately after the first movie ends at the gas station with ChromeSkull presumably dead while the cops arrive and the two lone survivors make their getaway, but things aren't exactly as they seem. ChromeSkull works for an organization that is completely behind every sick and twisted fantasy he could ever even think of wanting to videotape. At the head of this organization is Preston (Brian Austin Green), a guy who takes his job a bit too seriously and initially wants to become ChromeSkull himself. As Preston tries to pick up ChromeSkull's remaining loose ends, a new victim named Jess (Mimi Michaels) presents herself. Meanwhile, Tommy (Thomas Dekker) is still trying to keep it together three months later. Paranoid and convinced he's being followed around every turn, Tommy is terrified when he's dragged back to the police department one day and informed that ChromeSkull is not only alive and well but has returned in the most gruesome way imaginable.

It was pretty crazy seeing Brian Austin Green; that guy that married Megan Fox and became famous for ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" in a horror movie? Expectations are probably low, but he's actually quite good in this. Preston is kind of overly demented. He is absolutely obsessed with not only his work, but ChromeSkull himself. The way he evolves throughout the film, his body language, and facial expressions are all pretty unnerving. Thomas Dekker is the other side of that coin and just as good. Tommy tends to use his terror and paranoia in any ways necessary to survive. He just wants to move on with his life and forget the ChromeSkull thing ever happened, but he keeps being pulled back in. The only character that didn't sit well with me was Jess. After watching the special features, it's obvious that Mimi Michaels was completely submerged in her character and her performance proves that. The way she was written on the other hand just isn't so great. The eye surgery thing, how she was going blind, and how she had a working cell phone on her the entire film was interesting, but everything else relating to the character felt incredibly clich of every other female horror character in history; she screamed and cried at EVERYTHING and was somehow able to survive because of it.

The kills are stupendously nasty. They tend to last longer than most kills in other horror films and fake you out by cutting to black and then showing you everything anyway or making you think the kill has ended and then taking it a step further. There's a scene in the movie where Preston has his weapons guys build him this spring loaded star blade because he's incapable of spinning the blade on his own like ChromeSkull. This weapon is utilized in the most delightfully repulsive of ways and delivers the most memorable and horrendous death of the film.

Despite Laid to Rest 2 being a vast improvement over the original film, it still has its flaws and most of it probably lies within how it's written. At one point in the film, King (Owain Yeoman) tells Tommy that he doesn't have to worry. They have a lot of cops and a lot of guns. Yet up until that point only three cops are shown on screen and even later only three more are shown. ChromeSkull wiped out an entire police department on his own, but if each department only has six officers then that's a little less impressive. ChromeSkull's mirror scene is a must-see though. One of the only scenes you HAVE to see other than the kills. The way he lurks in the shadows is really fantastic, as well. A little homage to Halloween is never a bad thing. But the thing that doesn't add up is we see ChromeSkull come back into form; he puts his mask back on in the second half and he is reborn. We watch him slaughter a guy and three police officers while wounding two others and the last remaining girl. Yet somehow this clumsy, borderline-blind girl who's been stabbed through the back of the calf is the one who manages to one-up ChromeSkull? Maybe he underestimated her or didn't give her enough credit, but it still seems a little farfetched.

ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 delivers everything the original film did and then some. The cast is better than expected, the writing has taken a step in the right direction, and the blood-soaked kills are grotesque enough to satisfy any die hard horror fan. With its drops of nudity and use of both digital and practical effects, Laid to Rest 2 contains all of the elements and framework of a cult classic yet lacks that nostalgic factor that most films like this yearn for. But as far as independent horror goes, ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 is nearly as good as it gets.

Special features are somewhat small, but enjoyable. There's audio commentary with director Robert Hall, co-writer Kevin Bocarde, and star Brian Austin Green. It's fairly interesting, as well. Commentary always drops little bits of information you'd never know otherwise. Information like the FBI building and the basement where the coffins were are the same building, Mimi put rocks in her shoe to keep up her limp even between takes, and there was a blend of digital and practical effects for most of the kills. If it's one thing commentary is it's informative. A Cut Above: Creating ChromeSkull is nearly thirty minutes in length. It's mostly the entire cast discussing how much they enjoyed working on this project with Robert Hall explaining a lot of the behind the scenes stuff. The tattoo in the film is actually real, but not to Brian Austin Green (Nick Principe, the man who portrays ChromeSkull, actually received the tattoo). The feature also goes into detail about how they improved this one over the original, ChromeSkull's makeup, and Robert Hall not wanting to explain absolutely everything. There's also a Jump to a Kill feature, which is exactly what it sounds like. Two minutes of deleted scenes, three and a half minutes of bloopers, and the original trailer wrap up the special features. Lastly, there is an after-credits scene which (according to the commentary) was the original idea for the sequel. Be sure to check it out.

ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 is the unrated director's cut version of the film. It was originally released as a rated R version for strong bloody violence, language, and some nudity. The unrated version does contain material different from the original R rated version. It's available in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Uncompressed PCM Stereo sound with optional English or Spanish subtitles. It's presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen 1.78:1 and also available in 480i Standard Definition. It is approximately 93 minutes long. ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 will be released Tuesday, September 20th in both retail stores and most online retailers.",1316390400,,7429,4.79921875

this film was a great ride gory creative and fun what more could you ask for just one thing give us part 1 and blu ray as well or at least a double pack
cuz i've moved onto blu ray and i really hate to have to buy part 1 on dvd and 2 on blu ray .

4560865,2,B0054602MG,"I will presume you have seen Chromeskull 1? If you haven't, then I really do recommend you see the first one if your are into a decent slasher flick... however, I wouldn't highly recommend this confusing sequel. This one takes place right where the last one left off, however, the events that follow I found hard to swallow, even tho slasher often take a route along these lines (I won't mention what exactly, as it would be a spoiler) but this one I found to be pretty hard to beleive.

For the next half an hour I was rather bored, sure, the first one was a low budget movie, but this one seemed like it had an even lower budget, and focused too much on boring character dialog or inserting drug use scenes for the hell of extending scenes longer then they needed to be. I was just about ready to turn the movie off at this point, but then comes a nice little kill scene that looked gory enough to make me say ""cool"". Then it dragged a little more, and another decent kill scene, then repeated itself. So many of the kill scenes seemed to be focused alot on the left side of the face; I guess the make-up/special effects department really favored that side? I was beginning to think they would all do that, but then a few heads fly, a couple of skulls ripped in half and a complete rip-off kill from Jason X (Friday the 13th part 10).

Towards the end I was getting rather bored of the whole thing, wondering what the heck was going on and who is who and what those guys where meant to be? In the end I think it made sense. However what it is setting up for in a 3rd movie seems, to me, stupid and I am not looking forward to a 3rd installment now.

When the first movie came out, a lot of us became instant fans of the film, and wondered how a sequel would play out? Most of us thought it would be a prequel to the first movie, but no, this one does kick-off where the last ended. But I don't think any of us expected this?

The gore and death scenes are pretty good, but the pacing of the film is what kills it. It really did seem like a low budget film this time around. It had very little pace, and scenes that where not needed to just get the whole thing rolling in motion. By the time the final act came, things had picked up a little, and I stopped rolling my eyes around wondering when something was going to happen again... But then after the final act, in the wrap-up scenes, it just left me thinking the writers have killed this from becoming a classic franchise, especially if I told you what the wrap-up has indicated the next film will be about, if it gets made.

I discovered this movie with excitement, not even knowing another one had been made, but after watching it, I left rather disappointed that this was the best idea they could come up with? They really should have listened to fans and gone backwards, and not done the stupid idea that has become this movie.

I give it two and a half stars... I wouldn't say I didn't like it, least not all of it, but I wouldn't say it was OK either. It's somewhere in-between. Surely not one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and had it been a movie on it's own not trying to continue on from Chromeskull 1, I might have barely let it slip into a 3 star rating.. but what they have done here... sigh... just not what we expected to see.

Rent it if you are interested.. the very few (3) other reviewers have said they enjoyed it more then I did, but no one has given really any detail as to what made it good? I'd have liked to have seen more reviews from people who loved the first one, but I guess the movie only has us few reviewing it so far, which might tell you something about this film if you decide to watch it.

I am not looking forward to a 3rd sequel, but if it does get made, I probably will check it out, so I guess the movie hasn't killed Chromskull all together for me, but again, I am not really looking forward to it.",1315699200,2,3901,4.150793650793651

4560867,3,B0054602MG,"I had the highest of hopes for this sequel seeing as I loved the first installment.
Chromeskull'Laid To Rest 2' was confusing and muddled and completely wasted the talents of Danielle Harris by casting her in a role that was unnecessary and coma like in dialogue and acting.

One bright spot in the movie would be the gore and gore effects. They were done really well,not as well as the first but pretty close although they were abundant.
Also actress 'Brianne Davis' was great in her role as a nearly blind girl and 'damsel in distress',she was another bright spot.
Brian Austin Green was in my opinion another disappointment. His acting was lackluster and his performance added nothing to the film,an unknown with good acting skills would have served better.

The last 30 minutes really picked up and got me interested . Before that I was just going through the motions of watching and hoping it would get better or make more sense.
The ending was somewhat confusing but the very last scene was ironic and clever. If your a gore lover I strongly suggest you see it ,if you want a movie with really great concept and depth I suggest you see Stake land (which in my opinion includes Danielle Harris' best performance to date) or The Clinic.",1313452800,8,1240,4.657534246575342

4560908,4,B0054602MG,"OK so I'm reviewing both the first and second in one shot...as they are quite similar to one another.
In the first LTR we have a woman with amnesia who is attacked by a man in a mask and manages to run off.
She is then picked up by a stranger on the road who brings her to his house,,, and from there the story sets off.
There is no explanation as to why the killer is doing what he is doing nor why does he where the mask nor why does he film all his murders with a camcorder attached to his shoulder.
But who cares because without him there's no movie.
Both movies have flaws in them...some flaws are inherent to slasher movies and so we expect them and through years have come to except them.
For example the terrifying killer in these movies is a slow walker he makes Terry Fox or Robocop appear downright speedy.
Seriously, a ticked off thirteen year old with a baseball bat or golf club could take him out no problem...first take out a knee and then go for the head.
Although not immortal like Jason, this guy can take some punishment...eye gets stabbed out, gets shot multiple times to the chest, stabbed in the back of the neck multiple times and shruggs that off no problem, and finally rips off his own face and then gets his head bashed in with a metal baseball bat.
He never speaks...only through texting and there is absolutely no explanation to his motives.
Also in the second one like in most movies the police are painted as absolute morons...sending a lone detective to investigate an area where they
strongly believe their killer maybe hiding alone, not realizing that they haven't heard from her in awhile...not calling for back-up when they should...letting one of their witnesses be kidnapped by a moron in their own police station...and finally having the worst reflexes in history...when you're a cop looking for a killer and out of nowhere he shows up and knocks you on your ass then maybe just shoot him and forgo the warning.
All these are what I call standard crap for your standard slasher flick.
As a matter of fact this movie is downright standard in many ways.
They tried a twist in the second one where there's this whole organization that apparently works for Chromeskull...weaing full on business suits and  everything... the main boss being played by Brian Austin Greene (Yay!!!!) (sarcasm) and his competitive colleague played by Danielle Harris.
I'm not sure why she is in this movie, her character was not all that important to the story. It seems that her name alone would attract attemtion and I can't help but feeling a little insulted as I'm not all that impressed with her as an actor...seriously for some bad acting on her part watch Hatchet 2 or 3.
Also they don't even try to explain why a bunch of people dressed as lawyers are helping a mute, mask wearing sociopath kill off anyone he wishes to.
What's the point of throwing in a none standard aspect of a slasher movie and not elaborating on it?  It just made it more confusing for nothing.
The gore FX are the real stars of these two movies.
Easily some of the best I've ever seen and obviously the real reason for the making of these flicks.
That's all there is to it.
If you don't like alot of gore in your movies then stay away... on the other hand if you like gore to the point where you don't care that the story is retardedly shallow and really just a vehicle for the gory kills then these two treasures are for you so check them out.",1394236800,,3440,4.458730158730159

4560911,3,B0054602MG,"After nearly being killed by his would-be victims, ChromeSkull is revived by the secret agency that he has hired to assist him. As he continues to recover, one of his agents runs rogue and begins a murder streak of his own using the infamous trademarks of his homicidal employer. Robert Hall returns with CHROMESKULL: LAID TO REST 2, which unfortunately is only a mild improvement over the original. Outside of his semi-autobiographical surprise hit LIGHTNING BUG, Hall continues to prove that his major strengths lie in make-up design and special effects, and not writing or directing. This time around, there are more interesting character struggles and a stronger principle cast, but they are both outweighed by the logical inconsistencies and unresolved plot points. While Thomas Dekker puts in another passable performance, Mimi Michaels becomes entirely unnecessary, and Brian Austin Green shoots way over the top as the ambitious Preston. At least we can thank Robert Hall for delivering on the gore, with even more inventive kills and a body count that nearly triples ChromeSkull's overall score. Stuntman Nick Principe remains the strongest element in the series next to the special effects as the man behind the mask. Like with Adam Green in HATCHET 2, Robert Hall has not learned enough from fan criticism or his own experience to make this a successful film, but it does provide enough blood to guarantee him a third shot in the next sequel.

A fairly simple slasher story with a unique twist and terrific gore effects has now mutated into a big bloated mess.

Chromeskull, a potentially great iconic character, is now the leader of a massive underground shadowy corporation that kills girls for sport?? Or something??

Somehow co-producer and former ""90210"" star Brian Austin Green is now the center of the action, not Chromeskull who is convalescent most of the time. Almost all of the kills belong to B.A.G. and not the actual title character who doesn't bother to show up until the last reel.

On top of this, the gory kills have an really unpleasant misogynistic vibe. Almost all of the victims are women whose boobs pop out while they are being gruesomely gutted, so we can watch them bounce frantically while the girls struggle to cling to life before invariably being stabbed in the mouth.

In short?  ...Ick!

Very little about this installment supports the setup of the first film.  Instead of keeping the mystique of Chromeskull intact, they lose themselves trying to construct an elaborate back-story to explain things they never actually bother to explain.  For example, Chromeskull is put back together like the Six Million Dollar Man!  He apparently has an entire team working for him.  Odd, considering most serial killers don't work by committee.  Among the battalion of helpers, Chromeskull has a tiny sycophant aid (played with little to no ability by Danielle Harris who is still trading on her one claim to fame: Halloween), and a stupid wannabe (played with little to no ability by TV actor Brian Austin Green).  It was distractions like these that helped tank this sequel.  First of all, if it isn't broken don't try to reinvent what you know already worked.  Don't limit the story by bringing in elements that are absurdly impossible (no amount of reconstructive surgery could bring back Chromeskull's head!).  Having the victim in this piece practically legally blind was also redundant; especially considering the final showdown took place in the dark!  Making the police a notch above the Keystone Cops added an element of hilarity I don't think they were trying for.  In the entire cast only one actor (Thomas Dekker) took his part seriously and acted appropriately in the given circumstances.  The rest of the cast just floundered, flopping around like dead fish.

I rented Laid to Rest 2, and boy was I pleasantly surprised.  Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't a Gone With the Wind caliber movie, BUT for its genre, it's really not too bad.  Shot and made on a shoestring budget, what it does provide are some very creepy moments and some kills that are just brutal.  Part 2 picks up where Part 1 stopped.  But, Chromeskull is taken to an ""underground"" hospital and revived.  It seems that Chromeskull is a creation of some sort of organization.  Why he has been created is not answered, nor is why he does what does.  That's too bad, because I think that would have given a little more ""oomph"" to the overall story.

Brian Austin Green plays Chromeskull's biggest, most ardent fan--cleaning up his messes he leaves behind.  Trouble is, he also wants to BE Chromeskull and, well, there's only room enough for one of them.  Danielle Harris, usually the screaming victim-to-be in the Halloween series, plays nursemaid to Chromeskull.  There is a scene between the two of them--and it has not one drop of blood--that was the most disturbing scene I've seen in a long time.  The girl who plays Chromeskull's unintended victim reminded me of Marilyn Burns, who played the only survivor of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Her nuances in playing an almost-blind, terrified out of her mind victim was very real.  As with Burns' character, I just wanted her to stop screaming!!

This movie is UR and lasts 93 minutes.  It was directed by Robert Hall.  For all you gorehounds out there, let me just say this:  there are two kills in this movie that actually made me wince!  So, go enjoy yourself.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1323820800,,1889,4.7446153846153845

No comparison.  The death scenes are rather lame, give or take one or two, the story is ridiculous, the acting is pretty bland, and the end is just laughable.  The beauty about the first movie was the fact that it felt like they weren't really trying, which made it feel actually believable, and the mystery behind this chrome masked man was pretty cool.  However, this sequel tries WAY too hard to be ""clever"" and complicated, which just makes it blow in the worst way possible.

4560941,2,B0054602MG,"I haven't seen CHROMESKULL's predecessor so it's hard to give this sequel a totally objective review.  Accordingly, when the film begins, it's like walking into the middle of the first movie.  Without knowledge of the premise underlying the plot, it's difficult understanding what's going on.  Suffice to say, this is a brutal and sadistic movie, with lots of gore and dismemberment.  The movie is chaotically filmed and directed with little style or imagination.  A cast of usually reputable actors can't overcome the overall inadequacies of the script.  Owain Yeoman (THE MENTALIST) plays the lead detective in a zombie-like daze; 90210's Brian Austin Green swaggers through a role that makes no sense; Gail O'Grady (BOSTON LEGAL) looks like she just woke up from a bad dream and Mimi Michaels so whiny you can hardly understand her.  Only Thomas Dekker's performance as the victimized teen manages to give credence to his role.
I know sequels are often worse than the original, but this movie doesn't inspire me to go back and view LAID TO REST.",1320105600,,1048,5.023121387283237
4560942,2,B0054602MG,"The sequel to FX guru Robert Hall's surprisingly good Laid to Rest is finally here, and sadly, it's a mammoth disappointment.  Picking up shortly after the first film left off, ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 finds our mysterious chrome-skulled killer back at it with a vengeance as survivor Tommy (Thomas Dekker) becomes a target, as well as a girl (Mimi Michaels) who is slowly losing her eyesight.  In the middle of all this we learn a little more of just what ChromeSkull is and how he gets away with his ghastly deeds, which make little to no sense.  Brian Austin Green is on board as well as a pseudo-employee, and has gleeful fun in his role, but other than that there really isn't anything here that does much justice to the original.  While there's copius amounts of ultraviolent gore effects, the film is much more sadistic in tone than the first, which makes it all the less enjoyable to boot.  Not to mention the fact that a decent chunk of the film is just plain boring.  It's a shame that this sequel doesn't measure up to the first, because there was an opportunity here to do something really special.  Instead, the end result is this disappointment.  Also featuring genre stalwart Danielle Harris in a vampy role.",1319760000,,1226,4.643518518518518
4560943,4,B0054602MG,"great gory slasher, better than the 1st, it has SAW elements check it out you'll see what i mean. the plot was ok, a little confusing about chromeskulls orginization/cult(BIG PLOTHOLE) who knows. the casting was fine they brought back the guy from the 1st one but a different woman was cast in this one(the other survivor that killed chromeskull). they kill her off at the beginning. Danielle Harris and Brian Austin Green work for chromeskull, no explanation why. But other than that its a great slasher i have seen in a while(also check out SCRE4m), check it out. Also watch after the credits there's more.",1318464000,,608,4.8
4560944,3,B0054602MG,"I have seen the first movie, and it was quite good for a slasher flick.  This movie however, was mostly a drawn out mess.  It took way too long to really get to the good stuff, and Brian Austen Greene was just a little too over the top in this.  If you just love the gory stuff then you'll like this, it has plenty. It doesn't, however, deliver on scares.  It was kind of boring, and the whole ""organization"" angle didn't really add anything to the story. Overall, just okay.",1318118400,,475,4.2444444444444445
4560945,4,B0054602MG,"Overall a great movie much better then the first esp the acting in this one actually makes sense and doesn't sound like the actors are insane. I love how the story picks up from the first one and it explains chromeskull's back story. The Gore is much better then the first and does have alot of kills better then most horror movies now a days. Also I like how this is a NEW idea and not a remake like most of the horror movie are. Some people don't like Brian austin green ,but he fits the bill in this movie for the fact he is take care of chromeskull and fixing up all the loose ends It's nice to see he plays a role where he can be the nice guy then this insane whack job who loves to kill. The special features are good esp the bloopers and the making of the movie. Can't wait for part 3.",1317168000,,792,3.9874213836477987
4560946,2,B0054602MG,"Light on the gore. Shallow and unlikeable characters. A Boring and entirely
illogical explanation of the title character's purpose. It's a shame too
because the first film had some shocking gore, top-drawer special effects
and well-defined and likeable characters. Basically, this film loses just about all that
made the first one good.

Rent this movie before buying it.",1316908800,4,371,5.396551724137931

I think being in a cadaver lab would be more entertaining.  So right, not my cup of tea. And I did see and like the first one.",1505088000,,300,3.9166666666666665
8456308,4,B0054602MG,"Considering that I wasn't expecting too much, this kind of did better than my expectations. I did not see the first one at all and after watching the extras I will not be watching it but this as a stand alone movie worked okay for me. Brian Austin Greene made this movie for me to be sure. He has this bad guy vibe down pretty good.  If I had to say the one thing that bothered me was the almost going blind girl who is taken by the bad guys and all she does is make a ton of noise and whimper and cry and scream. No matter how many times she is told to keep it down she just never stops and it really did annoy me, oh and not to forget the boy sacrificing himself for the girl....again. The killings are pretty good and very gory and violent. For all my fellow horror fans, I do give it a recommendation.",1495584000,,805,3.9691358024691357

8456315,3,B0054602MG,"I don't know how I feel about it. It wasn't terrible but it lost my interest throughout the movie. The gore scenes were good, but they almost got too predictable. Predictable as in, ""you know it's going to be extreme and ridiculous"" so it doesn't surprise you when someone else dies in a brutal, horrific way. But at the same time, I like those kind of gore movies...but eh, it wasn't the most exciting.

I liked the idea of the chromeskulled slasher guy, but I feel like he needed someone else to make him into a horror movie.
He deserves to be on the big screen in a more expensive movie, in my opinion. With real actors and better film editing and directing...
because I find him bad ass.

All in all, it's OK. Maybe not worth buying, wait for a price reduction.",1453507200,,765,4.3426573426573425
