1000873,5,6305263671,"Dreadnaught is really a film to remember and perhaps a piece worthy and notable in any collection. As a martial arts enthusiast I looked for impressive fight sequences, great technical choreography, and of course, originality. This film employs all these qualities. Yuen Biao is in top form as well as the legendary Kwan Tak Hing. The story line actually has more substance than the vanguard of films in this genre, and it embodies typical chinese humor and culture. The film marks one of the more notable ones in Yuen Biao's career, and the footage no doubt proves it. In respect to the previous reviews, I agree with Mr. Ryan and disagree with Phil. Perhaps he is right with his analysis of a different type of martial arts film in mind. This is a classic film, traditional, or rather, old school. For the enthusiasts out there or even the ones with questions-I emplore you, watch the film. My first image of it was a preview from a film I can't remember. That drove me to watch it and I consider it to be one of the greatest films of its type. By type I specifically mean traditional wu shu, no wire work, Chinese settings and time period, etc. If you enjoy, I recommend Drunken Master, Magnificent Butcher, and Young Master. Thanks for listening to one man's words.",979603200,13,1269,4.619469026548672
1000874,3,6305263671,"I am in general, always diasagreeing with 'Phillie'. My views on martial arts films seem to be the opposite. This film shows technically astute and well choreographed scenes, featuring some of the best names in Hong Kong, in portrayal of one of China's Legends, Wong Fei Hung. I like all martial arts films with good, technical, impressive fights and choreography, and sometimes a few laughs along the way, whereas mr phillie seems to like cheesy comedy more than the art forms we are supposed to be watching! This as with all Sammo, or Yuen Biao films impresses with its mastery of Martial Arts. Lets take thos film for what it is, not put down fight scenes if you don't understand them.",979430400,4,688,4.694214876033058
1000875,1,6305263671,"I didn't like this movie at all....I thought it would be a good movie , because it had Yuen Biao and ""Beardy"" in it..but they don't show off any skills...the fightscenes are really pathetic...better skip this  one!",964137600,2,214,4.783783783783784
1000876,4,6305263671,"Early 1980's movie by the Yuen clan,with Woo Ping directing. This movie starts out with a notorious criminal named White Tiger(played by Yuen Hsin Yee) and his wife being attacked by the police. White Tiger is already a  little crazy but when his wife is killed,he escapes seeming to be almost  completely insane. He gets help from an old business partner(played by  Phillip Kao) who runs an opera troupe,and allows White Tiger to hide out in  the troupe. In the same town lives a washer boy named Mousey(Yuen Biao) who  is a coward. His sister teaches him Eagle Claw kung fu but he doesn't know  it. He is actually training while washing clothes. He's scared of almost  everyone and everything. After being attacked by White Tiger(who paints his  face up in opera make up) in an alley for ringing a small bell(which makes  White Tiger go a bit crazy because his wife was wearing a similar bell when  she died)which he considers his lucky charm,Mousey's best and only friend  Leung Foo(Leung Kar Yan) decides to ask Wong Fei Hung(Kwan Tak Hing)if he  will teach Mousey kung fu. The police are still looking for White Tiger and  ask master Wong for help. While Leung is looking in the opera house he is  attacked and killed by White Tiger,who has decided to help Phillip Kao kill  master Wong. Mousey, finding that his best friend has been killed by the  crazed opera killer,finally gains the nerve to face White Tiger. When Mousey  basically falls into the criminal's trap,master Wong saves him but is hurt  by a dart and can't fight. So Mousey takes over and fights White  Tiger,rubbing his skin away and literally beating him to death. He utilizes  the washer techniques he learned from his sister and does a lot of damage  to White Tiger. Yeun Cheung Yan has a small role as one of the police  officers. I didn't see Yuen Chun Yeung or Yuen Yat Chor anywhere,but I  believe they helped with the choreography. Speaking of choreography,it is  great as usual,with Yuen Hsin Yee taking(and giving) some hard  blows. Overall it's a great movie not to be missed.",957744000,4,2059,4.684357541899441

7886428,5,6305263671,"This is another simple kung fu flick plot but it is well done and the picture quality is very good.  The kung fu exhibitions are excellent and the choreography, camera work, and editing are pretty darn good.  Fun to watch and entertaining.",1486857600,,239,4.666666666666667

7886430,3,6305263671,"It is an average movie. I always Yuen Biao's movies especially when he was the main character. I like his fighting style, but the plot and action scenes in this movie was as strong as I would like to see. Otherwise  it is a good martial art movie.",1484092800,,247,4.145833333333333
7886431,5,6305263671,"Great Chinese lion fight scenes in this movie with a good story.  There are two types of Chinese lions when it comes to the Chinese dances done by kung-fu schools, one is from Bejing (Yellow and Red) and the other is from south China such as Canton and Hong Kong (colorful).  In this movie the two types of lions fight from two schools. The colorful one comes from the famous school of Wong Fei Hong, a real historical person who is considered one of the highest quality Chinese kung-fu personality of his time. In this movie, he is a Eastern doctor/healer.  Wong Fei Hong is a modest character and trains students to be good people, and the other school has no morals and only wants to show off to be the best known school.  This movie has really good choreographed kung-fu.  Saw this movie as a kid and it's still as good the second time.",1483833600,,840,4.393548387096774

Only regret that no option for English dub.
But definitely worth having as collection reference for Yuen Biao",1370390400,,273,4.934782608695652
7886434,5,6305263671,i had the prevelige of seeing this film at a cinema in birmingham when it  first came out and i was speechless its  a top draw film in my opinion,1171238400,,145,3.8
7886435,3,6305263671,"This is a star-packed occasion, and when that happens, no matter what the genre, the end product is usually dissappointing.  ""Dreadnaught"" is no exception.  If I were rating this movie on kung fu alone - and if you are looking to add to an ""old school"" collection, this movie is not worthy - a single star(I beg to differ with an earlier reviewers).  If you are looking for a decent movie with good acting (for a kung fu film)then this is not too bad.  I will breakdown my rating a bit more:

Original Chinese:  gives one star

Old Wang Fei Hong:  Great job - would've like to see him in more fight scenes.  The same actor plays Wang Fei Hong in another movie (I wish I could remember the name here) and is much more active and creative.  (star number 2)

Decent Story:  1 star

Remember:  If you are buying this as a gong fu flick - DO NOT BUY.  Yuen Biao and Lueng Ka Yan have much, much better movies (Knockabout, The Victim)... you can actually buy both for the price tag on this film!",1154736000,,989,4.241935483870968
7886436,4,6305263671,"This is not your average kung fu classic, more of a comedy chase caper.  Yuen Biao does his normal share of amazing stunts but what makes this film cool is the unique fighting styles and the endearing relationships between the bumbling protagonist and those around him.  Not as hard hitting as YOUNG MASTER or MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER, this film is still a gem worth having in the finest of kung fu collections.",1059609600,3,406,4.704225352112676
