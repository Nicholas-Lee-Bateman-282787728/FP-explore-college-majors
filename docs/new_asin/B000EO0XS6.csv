And the typos -- ""Back In The Eggs?""  Come on, if you want to fool people, you need to do a little research and know how to spell titles correctly.

I recommend buying the legitimate, professional and crystal-clear ""The McCartney Years"" 3-DVD set instead.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-McCartney-Years/dp/B000VRJ37I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The McCartney Years</a>",1271030400,,585,6.864864864864865
8166156,1,B000EO0XS6,"I was just about to.............but then upon closer inspection, I realized there were a bunch of people that were duped into buying this as an authentic item. They were all selling this on a very very well known auction website. Anyways, honestley If you are going to bootleg leg something even if its old VH1's video clips, atleast don't have the temerity to list all the information on the back of the case with one single ERROR. IT PIPES OF PEACE......not pipes of SPACE. Also for the time period they covered they excluded the videos O'uest Di Soeil & Put it there,(which is one of my favorites, by the way). Save your money on this,if you want the real thing your going to have to wait for Macca to release the whole load as a compilation DVD one day. Till then you'll just have to do what the Japanese do, Laser disc collect.",1166140800,2,832,4.444444444444445
8166157,1,B000EO0XS6,"Only Astro has any credibilty of the reviewers here.

Read the reviews of the ""other writers."" They all penned their ""other reviews"" on the same day, and they were written by a PR firm, not a real fan.",1166140800,2,201,4.2894736842105265
8166158,1,B000EO0XS6,"Just to correct the erroneous information here. Firstly this is a bootleg, made up exclusively of VH1 tv recordings. The audio is dolby digital stereo at 192kbs. A rather low bitrate audio. At the very least they could have bumped the bitrate up to 448kbs to give us better sound. It isn't surround sound by anyone's stretch of the imagination. The fact it's not made by any major record studio should be the first giveaway. The Beatles' record studio was EMI. If anybody would release a collection of videos, it would be EMI. That isn't to say the songs or videos are bad, they're OK for TV recordings, but let's not make this to be something it's not.",1157673600,7,653,4.5423728813559325

8166161,5,B000EO0XS6,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! If you're a Paul McCartney fan, you can't go wrong with this excellent set performance. If you're particularly blessed with a large screen TV and accompanying surround-sound speaker system, crank up the sound and let 'er rip! I went to bed with it in my mind, woke up with it still in my mind. Enjoy.",1141171200,2,330,4.426229508196721
