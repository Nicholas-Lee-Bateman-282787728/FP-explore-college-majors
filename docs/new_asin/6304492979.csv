7873169,5,6304492979,"I love this video as it has some of the best songs from the Disney Renissance. Although I wish it had songs from The Great Mouse Detective and Oliver & Company and other songs from the other films. It seems weird to have Hercules songs on this volume since they weren't released in the US at the time, but in other countries the songs had been in a foreign Disney Sing Along Songs volume, ""Hercules"" (which was never released in the US although Zero to Hero would be in ""Honor to Us All"" a year later). Here is the list of songs:
1. Circle of Life (The Lion King)
2. Be Our Guest (Beauty and the Beast)
3. One Last Hope (Hercules)
4. Under the Sea (The Little Mermaid)
5. A Whole New World (Aladdin)
6. Topsy Turvy (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)
7. Colors of the Wind (Pocahontas)
8. Prince Ali (Aladdin)
9. Part of Your World (The Little Mermaid)
10. Zero to Hero (Hercules)",1375142400,,874,4.271084337349397
