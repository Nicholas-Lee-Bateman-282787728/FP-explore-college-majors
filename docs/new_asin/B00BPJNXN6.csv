Other reviews have mentioned that it could be a boot leg copy; to that I say. if it is,  it is masterfully done. It is a complete and wonderful collection of Sailor Moon that I'm happy to own.",1405123200,,289,4.254545454545455
8572285,1,B00BPJNXN6,"Please do not be fooled! This is 100% UNOFFICIAL, it's a bootleg! As the other reviews says, discs are out of order, images are wrong, etc.",1403136000,,139,4.384615384615385
8572286,3,B00BPJNXN6,"First off I've been a fan of Sailor Moon ever since it aired for the first time in america, now that I'm in my adult years I figured I might as well recapture my childhood memories of watching my most favorite show. This complete box set has all of the five seasons (1) Sailor Moon, (2) Sailor Moon R, (3) Sailor Moon S (4) Sailor Moon Super S (5) Sailor Moon Super Sailor Stars), including the main Three Sailor Moon movies all are Dubbed in english. However while viewing all dvd's which are not in correct order I did discover  that where Sailor Venus's image is placed on the DVD case which should be the first seasons episodes, the audio is all in Japanese! it does not come in english. I didn't mind that the 5th season came only in japanese audio because I understood it was never dubbed in english. But I was upset that the first season did not come in english audio. So if you are planning on purchasing the whole complete box set I'd advised to be very aware of dvd's that do not come with specific episode listings. I give this product three stars only because it does give you all episodes, it's fun to watch anime and third well it's Sailor Moon.",1400716800,2,1159,4.31651376146789

8572288,5,B00BPJNXN6,"I've always wanted the whole collection of sailormoon, it was soo hard to find back then in a DVD format.. and I found it :) . It sometimes skips, idk why. but glad I bought the series.",1382140800,,185,4.027027027027027
8572289,5,B00BPJNXN6,I will enjoy watching this series again and again and it is just like I remember from watching it on the television.,1381449600,,116,4.318181818181818
8572290,1,B00BPJNXN6,"The product arrived on time and was in desired condition however, I have to rate it low as the DVD was a bootleg copy not the original as I was lead to believe from the discription. There is way too many episodes on each disc and the art work does not fit the season. For bootleg the episodes are of superior quality but the sound isn't quite right. I encourage anyone one interested in theproduct to purchase a season at a time if they desire high quality sound and pictures. Regaurdless piracy is just not cool. Please consider that when you look into this DVD collection.

Those points aside the seller did a great job with both packaging and even included some items as gifts I didn't order very cool. Just not as cool as legit copy sorry.",1380067200,8,743,4.384057971014493
8572291,5,B00BPJNXN6,"These are fabulous, and I highly suggest them to anyone! Just how I remember it from my childhood days :)",1376092800,,105,4.3
8572292,5,B00BPJNXN6,"I gave this five stars for the mere fact of its existence.  Repro is excellent throughout, aside from a slight 'break up' in the OP of series 1 episode 1 (also present in the 'extra' box set 1 I somehow inadvertently ordered, so presumably a flaw in the original master).
Series 1 & 2 (Sailor Moon R) are the edited & censored, 82-episode DIC ('deek') package, which did not distinguish them from one another.  Several episodes were omitted from both series, and episodes 45 & 46, the series 1 conclusion, were cut down into U.S, 40.
The adaptation is fine, with good vocal performances all round.  Typically for TV anime at the time (1995 that is), the chara names were 'Americanized' and the original music replaced, with a greatly rewritten 'cover' of the theme song (repeated over the end titles).
---
Curiously, I ordered these separately (before discovering the box sets), but what came, in the same package, were uncut, subbed versions of series 1 & 2, re-authored from the 2003 AD Vision releases.  Not that I'm complaining, mind.
---
Sailor Moon S & Super S (series 3 & 4) were re-authored from the dual language Pioneer releases, while the R, S & Super S movies, also dual language, are Pioneer dupes (the latter two shorn of the FBI warning & Pioneer masthead).
Sailor Moon Sailor Stars (series 5), previously ordered separately, is subbed only (it was never dubbed; being impossible to air here due to 'content' impractical to 'clean up', no U.S. company would touch it), with an excellent translation.  The Toei internet address at the end of several episodes suggests that they produced it themselves.
And I guess that's that...
Or it was, till I recently learned (relative to this 8/14/14 writing) that Viz Media has licensed all 5 TV series and the three movies, along with the new series, Sailor Moon Crystal (a remake of the first TV series, alas, rather than the reported sixth season); dunno when Viz is going to start releasing them, but can't wait.",1371513600,7,1970,4.765395894428153
