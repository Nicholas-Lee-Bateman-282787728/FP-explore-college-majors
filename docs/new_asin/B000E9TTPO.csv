2511272,4,B000E9TTPO,"In the past the French have produced some great crime films, Rififi, Grisbi, Cercle Rouge and Le Doubos spring to mind. However in recent years if they have keep up this tradition, it has not come to the attention of the English speaking film watching world.

36 Quai des Orfevres (the French equivalent of Scotland Yard or Number One Police Plaza) may not come up to the standard of the very best of the past but it is certainly a film worth watching.

The story revolves arround two cops, Vrinks (Daniel Auteuil) and Klein (Gerald Depardeu). Each heads a section of the French police and both are keen to catch of gang of brutal armed robbers. It is clear that at one time they were friends and maybe rivals for the love of Vrinks' wife. Now they are bitter rivals willing to undermine each other in order to get the glory of catching the robbers. The prize of becoming the new Chief of Detectives for Paris is also behind their rivalry.

Both are ruthless and willing to step outside the law in order to catch trhe bad guys. For Klein however ambition as become all. Vrinks whatever his faults is still for the most part motivated by the need to catch criminals, even if he is willing to do some violent and illegal things to catch them.

Auteuil and Depardeu are perhaps the biggest male stars in French cinema today. Auteuil gives his usual fine performance, for Depardeu this is his best performance in years and proof of what a powerful actor he is. Without speaking he can convey more with a look or a glance that most actors can with a ten minute speech.

I am not sure that the English subtitles give a accurate translation from trhe French. Can it be that the robbers go to all that planing and cause all that mayhem for a paltry 100,000 Euros?

All in all a film worth 4 stars, it would have got five had Depardeu been in it more.",1144281600,6,1842,4.402941176470589

Vivid characters, believable situations, slam-bang action, brilliant acting by the entire cast, especially Daniel Auteuil.

The original Quai des Orfvres came out in 1947 and proved to be a crime film noir classic. Seeing both is well worth the effort.

2511288,3,B000E9TTPO,"Former cop Oliver Marchal's classy French policier has in its favour two great performers on top form in Daniel Auteuil and, especially, Gerard Depardieu (who gives surprising depth to what appears to be a seriously underwritten part consisting mainly of troubled glances) and the neatest set of moral bear traps to face a movie cop since the original Insomnia as the two veterans compete for a promotion with disastrous consequences. Yet while the performances are strong and the script better than average for the genre, the musical score is a major problem that unfortunately works so strongly against the film that it ends up drowning many of its good points. It's not that the main theme is bad, but does it HAVE to be used without variation in almost every single scene in the last two thirds of the picture? Sadly, this is by no means an exaggeration, and the repetition does the film no favours. (Thankfully Marchal's much better followup with Auteuil, MR73, released by the Weinstein Company under the absurd title The Last Deadly Mission, doesn't have the same problem.)

A US remake with a no-doubt sleepwalking Robert De Niro is in the offing, but while you're waiting, the French DVD boasts a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer with optional English subtitles on the feature, although Marchal's French audio commentary is unsubtitled.",1255219200,,1346,5.0358744394618835

This is a great film. The acting is superb and it hasn't got that ""Hollywood cop show"" feeling about it. The French can make some really good flics, which don't seem to get the distribution that most of the rubbish that is pumped out of Hollywood does.

2511291,4,B000E9TTPO,"**** 2004. Written and directed by Olivier Marchal. Eight Csar awards nominations. Paris. Two policemen try to find a dangerous gang with their respective team. In the Jean-Pierre Melville tradition, 36 QUAI DES ORFEVRES is a really great French thriller. You'll also have the opportunity to admire the face-to-face of the two French stars Grard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil who are especially good in this film. Highly recommended.",1224201600,,432,5.367647058823529
2511292,5,B000E9TTPO,"First at all, this movie is since its release a true classic; a film that will involve you since the first shot due its powerful realism.

Two veteran police officials (Klein and Wrinks) have countless merits to occupy the role of Director of the Police. Both have their own methods out the law, where corruption, double cross and underworld's informants allow him to survive in the asphalt's jungle.

But Klein has a serious problem with the drink, his wife left him by Wrinks and that will be the dramatic spark that will ignite the screen when the opportunity makes its appearance.

A thriller of majuscule intensity and sober maturity, where the inner violence is by far, even major than the physical. Auteuil and Depardieu conform a splendid team hard to find in the world. Both are the majuscule actors of the French Cinema, plus the brilliant and brutal script make of this movie an outstanding and original thriller filled of innovativeness due its intense realism.

A must - see.",1209686400,,988,4.828402366863905

2511294,4,B000E9TTPO,"Paris' ""36 Quai des Orfvres"" means London's Scotland Yard and this gritty French neo-noir is part inspired by real-life events that happened in January, 1985, according to the director Olivier Marchal, who formerly worked as police officer during the 1980s. The film stars Daniel Auteuil as Lo Vrinks, the leader of BRI, division of the Paris Police, and Grard Depardieu as Denis Klein, head of BRB, another division of the same organization.

The premise looks familiar; Lo and Denis chase the same heavily-armed ruthless robbers who terrify the city, but Lo, who knows the underworld of Paris better than anyone, is always one step ahead of power-hungry Denis who desperately wants to arrest the criminals to get promoted. The intricate relations between the characters involve Camille (Valria Golino), Lo's wife, to whom Denis seems still attached.

The tension slowly but steadily rises as the story unfolds, and when the gangsters are finally found, one of the characters does one unexpected thing, which triggers a chain reaction of the events beyond the ill-fated characters' control. Despite some unlikely behaviors of some characters and several coincidences, director Olivier Marchal (who briefly appears as one ex-convict Christo) did a fine job in keeping the tension and slick pace of the film throughout the story.

""36 Quai des Orfvres"" is a slick crime drama with tight storyline, supported by great performances from the actors, especially Daniel Auteuil and Grard Depardieu. The film is not without predictable places, but still the intense conflict between the two leading characters is always fascinating to see.",1171324800,6,1632,5.317829457364341
2511295,1,B000E9TTPO,"Although this film held great promise, it was, in the end, a huge disappointment.  What went wrong?  There was Auteuil and Despardieu, the cover was classy, and the story was intriguing.

Midway through the film, I decided to start again from the beginning, as I was completely confused.  The second time around what was happening became a little clearer, but then it got fuzzy again as I passed the mid point. What was the problem?  For one thing, all the villians looked alike, although their differences were important to understanding the plot. Some were Daniel's snitches, some were Gerard's, some were members of a gang unconnected to both, and so on.  Although they all looked Balkan (not a Frenchman among them), it was difficult, even at the end, to sort them out.

Good and evil was absolutely divided between Auteuil and Despardieu, and the story seemed to be simply that some people are good and some are evil.  This was crude, and hard to believe, given the fact that both are very subtle actors. The music was promisingly minimalist, but after a while became incredibly irritating.  No matter what was happening, the music was exactly the same.  It added nothing to our understanding of the story, and seemed only to exist to tell us how avant garde the film was.  The love between Auteuil and his curly headed wife allowed an out-of-the-blue sex-in-the-shower scene.  It also seemed a way to say how wonderful Auteuil was, and how awful the normally lovable Despardieu was, since he did not seem to like his wife and they did not have sex-in-the-shower.  Gerard's wife actually was quite pretty and seemed to care for him, and had much more normal hair. The film's denouement was totally manipulated and hard to believe.  Could Daniel's wife really have been so stupid, under all that hair?  Is that why he loved her, because it made him seem so smart?

It was quite a shock to see Daniel's child seven years later, all grown up.  She had the same curly hair as her by now long dead mother, but otherwise was not recognizable as their progeny.  Although, from certain angles you could just made out a shnoz worthy of Daniel.

This was a film which promised much, in fact, everything, but was a huge disappointment! It was unnecessarily confusing, pretentious, and, in the end, trivial.  Too bad!",1161302400,2,2310,4.756281407035176

8107781,3,B000E9TTPO,"If your looking for solid films with some real old school movie making, don't count on us americans to deliver right now. We seem to be in a real slump lately and it's pretty sad. The best films seem to be comming out of other countries. Japan, France, Germany, brittain, even Norway, but not here, that's for certain. Thank god we still have some die hard film makers who still know how to make a good movie now and then. We still have Scorsesse, Fincher, Mann, Spielberg, Tarantino, and some others who once in awhile turn out some real great films. Right now though the French are really putting us americans to shame. This movie has a similar feel to gritty cop flicks like Heat, The French Connection, The Seven-ups, Black Rain, and a list of other gritty police thrillers. It's not as good as those films but it sometimes comes very close. I really like the male lead in this movie played by Daniel Auteuil, who is like a cross between Roy Scheider and William Friedkin. Here he plays the classic hero whom represents the true meaning of justice. On the other hand we have Grard Depardieu, who through a series of events becomes a very corrupt cop. The fil has some great gritty realism at times, some welll executed action sequences, but near the last 3rd of the film get's kind of bogged down a bit. I felt the music didn't seem at times all that ""First Rate"", and there were a few sillly moments that irritated me, such as a scene where a bunch of drunk cops shoot at a mouse skiddling along the backdrop of a bar. That almost ruined the film for me. None the less this film has some seriously well executed moments, and some great acting. it's no where near the tense and action packed film 'Heat' from Michael Mann, but it's still pretty good and chock full of that classic movie making style that has been missing in american films for the past 15 years.",1367625600,,1866,4.443148688046647
8107782,5,B000E9TTPO,"36th PRECINCT (36 QUAI DES ORFEVRES) is a 2004 film that is available to watch on Amazon instant Video: it should do very well with audiences who enjoy fine thriller/suspense dramas that depend on brilliant acting as opposed to endless pyrotechnics and CGI gimmicks. This film was inspired by a true story as related by director and actor and writer Olivier Marchal (with Franck Mancuso, Julien Rappeneau and Dominique Loiseau) of some corruption uncovered in the Paris police in 1985. The film is tense, forces the audience to think as the action jumps around showing simultaneous events in a smoothly cut and paste method of cinematic magic, and is populated with some very unforgettable characters who are a able to make us believe the fact that good cop/bad cop is a matter of interpretation in the vagaries of police action.

There are repeated serial heists in the criminal underbelly of Paris, hijacking and murders that confound the headquarters of the Paris Police headed by Robert Mancini (Andr&eacute; Dussollier). Two departments are challenged to put an end to the madness: the BRI headed by L&eacute;o Vrinks (Daniel Auteuil) and the BRB headed by Denis Klein (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) who are competing to head the police division now that the head Eddy Valence (Daniel Duval) is retiring. The personalities of these two competitors are quite different and the tone of past mistrust pervades every conversation and confrontation they have. Each is determined to be the one who brings the heinous group of criminals to justice. The violence escalates when Eddy is killed: the policemen are devoted to Vrinks who has considerable connections with the underworld such as Silien (Roschdy Zem) who seems to pull Vrinks down with an unexpected incident. Klein is the power obsessed cop who seems to stop at nothing to assure that he is responsible of the end of the hijackers/murderers, even to the point of involving Vrinks' wife Camille (Val&eacute;ria Golino) in an event that results in Camille's death. Vrinks and Klein each commit blunders that result in a chain of events that blurs the lines of morality and enters the realm of vendetta and revenge.

In addition to brilliant performances by both Anteuil, Depardieu and Golino there are memorable cameos by Francis Renaud as Titi, a cop with a heart, Anne Consigny as Klein's wife H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, Myl&egrave;ne Demongeot as the sassy older tart with a heart Manou. Daniel Antueil's daughter Aurore Auteuil who plays his screen daughter Lola as well, and even director Olivier Marchal as the criminal Christo. The musical score by Erwann Kermorvant and Axelle Renoir is unusually fine as is the cinematography by Denis Rouden who appreciates the importance of closeup shots of the intense psychological aspects of both Anteuil's and Depardieu's faces. This is a film for those hungry for intelligent and thought-provoking dramas. In French with English subtitles. June 12",1339286400,,2943,5.167714884696017
8107783,3,B000E9TTPO,"I wanted to like this movie - the reviews are pretty universally positive, it boasts an excellent director in Olivier Marchal and a great cast headlined by powerhouse actors Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil - but it fell short of all that promise.

If the viewer knows that the plot is based on a true story, it helps paper over what appears to be a choppy storyline, unclear motivation, and two-dimensional characters.  Auteuil's Leo Vrinks, makes an enormous error that will have grave consequences for himself and his family, and that seems drastically out of alignment with the rest of what we know about him.  Depardieu's Denis Klein, meanwhile, appears like some sort of evil charicature, a supposedly tough cop who demonstrates suddenly terrible judgement and poor impulse control.  Valeria Gallino's Camille, a woman intelligent enough to be a doctor, no less, makes some decidedly odd choices.  The list goes on, with the story hinging on a number of actions and events that seem to betray what we know about the players.  One such might ring true, but even if everything in the true story is captured here accurately, the sheer volume in the movie strains the credibility of the plot.

While it is, as one would expect with the talent on hand, well-acted, the script is full of maudlin sentiment and melodrama.  The cinematography is excellent, the action scenes are top-notch, but the series of ham-handed flashbacks in the final act bring down the quality of the storyline's execution.  It is, in my opinion, frustratingly inconsistent.

To be sure, however, this is not a bad film, and it is worth a look for fans of anyone attached to its production.  But viewers who are ignorant of the true events underpining the plot - like myself, going in - may find the film doesn't stand up well on its own.  36 Quai des Orfevres is not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, but it's not something I'll watch again, and definitely not the classic for which I had hoped.",1336608000,2,1977,4.748538011695906

The unpredictable nature of scenes in this movie, the sheer brutally within them, and the sense of `being put right into the deadly action where anything can happen' - all elevate this `high voltage' film to be considered as a Modern Classic in its own right. Masterful cinematic work by writer/director (Olivier Marchal) and deeply moving, incisive performances by renowned French actors, Daniel Auteuil and Grard Depardieu - drive the plot in and out of Dante's Inferno.
