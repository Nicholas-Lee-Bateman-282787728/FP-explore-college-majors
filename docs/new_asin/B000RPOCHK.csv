It's a British spoof of British spy movies, how much better can you get? There are a lot of quotable lines in these episodes much like Monty Python.  Not for American kids, maybe not even for British kids, but definitely fun to watch for the silliness, spoofiness and over the head remarks.  Amazon says that a percentage of people who bought B5: Lost Tales bought this, I am not surprised.

However, I simply can't get over the Italian Stiletto. It doesn't make sense to me. I just can't bring myself to watch it. It will be all wrong. I simply don't think it made any sense at all to make a special Region 1 release of DM without adding the US-aired version of Stiletto with a Cockney accent. At very least, it could have been provided as an alternate audio track. I guarantee all of us in Region 1 were best familiar with the show as aired on Nickelodeon with the Cockney-dubbed Stiletto.

2874783,5,B000RPOCHK,"This set consists of 9 discs, comprising all 10 seasons of this show. I recently finished them all and must say that if you're thinking of getting this out of a feeling of nostalgia, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well the shows hold up in your adult years. The humor style alternates between madcap and clever subtlety, both done with exquisite care. I don't know how the A&E compilation holds up to the BBC 30 year anniversary set, but I was more than happy with this one. The episodes are the original British versions, not the American ones (which most of us U.S. customers remember). The only difference I could see is that Stiletto, Baron Greenback's henchman, has an Italian accent instead of the Cockney lilt he was given for U.S. audiences.

At the price point here, you'd be foolish not to get this set, whether for yourself or for your children.",1325030400,2,863,4.640522875816994

I don't need or want the introduction song and beginning and ending credits for EVERY 5 minute episode! It made the whole thing unbearable after 3 episodes. It's still funny English satire comedy, but neither myself or my niece and nephew wanted to continue watching when it felt like we were spinning our wheels and barely getting anywhere. Being used to full length Disney and Pixar features might have ruined us, but this series would be much better if it ran the credits and then the entire multi-episode story arc, and then credits.

TIDBITS
I can happily report that if you hit the skip button, you will bypass the theme song. The never aired pilot is a feature on disc 1. It isn't exactly: it turns out to be the rough draft of the episode with bagpipes and the Loch Ness monster, albeit with different voice actors. The extra Count Duckula episode, sadly, is not really very funny. There appears to be a final episode (The Galactic 174, but unless you are British, you will never figure out the title), but it is not the American-style, flamboyant series finale: they simple destroy London and the Mark IV.",1315785600,,807,4.422818791946309

I remember when I was little my parents would every once and a while let me stay up and watch the cartoons.  And I was excited when I saw that they had finally, after all this time, released this fantastic little cartoon on DVD.  And the set doesn't disappoint.  Dangermouse is classic British humor and each episode has Dangermouse and Penfold fighting the evil Baron Silas Greenback and other villains.  Along the way Dangermouse and Penfold parody everyone from 007 to Sherlock Holmes.  Each episode is full of laughs.  I highly recommend this show and DVD set.",1308960000,2,735,4.607692307692307

With ""Danger Mouse,"" sadly, I didn't know this and picked up all of the individual season boxsets when they were released, and only now a few years later did I sell them off and finally pick up this superior Complete Series collection.  This box set contains exactly the same DVDs as the previous releases, but packaged in half the space with each season contained in a single DVD case.  They could have gone even better by packing them in slim cases, but it is still a big win for taking up less of my valuable shelf space.

Working within severe budget restrictions, the animation combines cut-paper illustrations reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's work for Monty Python's Flying Circus with traditional cel animation and spot-on voice acting.  Because of budget restrictions, the animators had to get creative so Danger Mouse and his assistant Penfold often found themselves in dark rooms, where only their eyes were moving around, or in white snow-bound areas where no landscape was needed.  More often than not things just got wacky.

These DVDs have some cool extras, including the never-aired pilot episode ""The Mystery of the Lost Chord"" that features a different voice cast and shows just how important Sir David Jason (Danger Mouse), Terry Scott (Penfold) and Edward Kelsey (Baron Silas Greenback) were to the production.  There are other nice features, like character profiles and the fantabulous ""Theme Song Karaoke"" because we all know that the Danger Mouse theme song is one of the best ever written.

The only disappointment with this collection is that it is not really ""complete,"" and edits out some of the material.  What is missing is the funny narrator intros and outros that appeared between segments, which I remember well from the original run.  A&E also released edited versions for their ""Nero Wolfe"" boxset, which is a bummer.  If you are going to label something as ""complete"" then I wish it truly were!

OK A&E, now I am just waiting for the ""Count Duckula Complete Series"" set.  I am not going to be fooled again into buying individual season boxsets when I know you are going to put out a better release eventually!",1276646400,3,3413,5.989711934156379

2874798,5,B000RPOCHK,"""Danger Mouse"" is the ultimate British cartoon serial for children and adults alike. Much like Bullwinkle's finest episodes, there are elements here accessible only to adults without ever taking away from the unadulterated fun of the silliest rodental superhero ever to emerge from the British empire. It's somewhat as if Monty Python and Ian Fleming had teamed up to make a cartoon series starring an impossibly suave mouse in a white jumpsuit and eye patch in various sleuthing activities.

Danger Mouse and his reluctant assistant hamster Ernest Penfold tackle a bewildering and funny set of nefarious evildoers, my favorite of which is the quintessentially evil archenemy Baron Silas Greenback, an evil toad who has both a large caterpillar-like sidekick (Nero) and an enforcer crow, Stiletto Mafiosa. The cast is largely rounded out with DM's boss Colonel K, who is ostensibly a chinchilla, though he looks more like a walrus (!) and several other lesser criminals such as Doctor Augustus P. Crumhorn, a lunatic mad-scientist wolf; Count Duckula, an image obsessed vampire duck (and my personal least favorite of the regular criminals), and lesser villains such as Doctor Frankenstoat, who is a stoat with world domination on his mind and slippers on his feet.

The episodes vary widely in length and complexity, but are always a treat for their uniquely British humor and whimsical touches: I was always especially fond of the concept that DM and Penfold lived in a mail box (""pillar box"") on Baker Street. The DVD set includes all ten seasons, and a staggering number of episodes plus several extras like ""Count Duckula"" episodes, the ""lost"" pilot episode, theme song karaoke (more entertaining than you might expect,) and more.

This is a great DVD set, and is perfect for any age.",1242259200,3,1789,5.098976109215017

2874801,5,B000RPOCHK,"Brian Cosgrove, in the late 1970's, created a wonderfully satirical send up of nearly every spy/mystery/science fiction story: Dangermouse. The writing is witty; the throw-away lines are superb; the situations, outrageous; the characterizations stretch the limits of stereotyping. We have Dangermouse, the one-eyed hero in a teflon (C) suit; Penfold, his inept assitant with semi-detached eyebrows; the evil Baron Greenback, the terrible toad and Stilleto, the henchiest of henchmen.

Not every episode is a total gem, but that may be because some referents escape me. However, even those episodes that are not my favorite are fun. The complete set even has a couple of episodes that I either missed or were not aired here in the US.

Dangermouse became my favorite cartoon when my daughter was still in her highchair. She would watch DM at the table while I cooked dinner. Recently, she took the role of enabler and ""talked me into"" buying the series. Her ulterior motive is that I have to lend her the discs.

2874804,5,B000RPOCHK,"I don't think there are enough words to express how much I loved watching Danger Mouse when I was little. The last year my sister and I were allowed to dress up for haloween, I simply had to dress up as Danger  Mouse, even though I'm a girl. I actually won a costume contest at Chucky Cheese that year. :)
I hold this show, along with The Tomorrow people,  entirely responsible for my life-long obsession with British TV shows, and was thrilled beyond belief when I found this box set.
I Actually had the UK 12-disc set first, but my problem with that set was that the episodes were in totally random order, and I could never remember where to find the episodes I wanted to watch.
So, I went ahead and invested in the US set. I'm so glad I did! the episodes seem to be in chronological order, there are lots more navigation options and best of all, there are more funny bits of narration to enjoy. I am, in fact, finding a ton of episodes that I never saw when I was little, so am having a ball watching this set.
The jokes, some of which even I have to admit are pretty bad, absolutely never get old for me. As an adult, however, I think I most appreciate the spectacular voice talent, especially that of David Jason, that was a part of this show.
The only flaw I can think of with this set, and it holds true with the UK set as well, is that on the ancient Danger Mouse VHS tapes I used to have, there were some really great narrator segments in between the episodes. The one with the studio fly immediately springs to mind. I've got a friend who has a DVD recorder/vcr, and am hoping that he can transfer the VHS tapes onto a DVD for me, just for those little extra segments that are sadly missing from the DVDs.
In spite of this one mild disappointment, I would rate this DVD set 10 stars if I could. It is so wonderful to have Danger Mouse back in my life.",1226275200,25,1861,4.181058495821727

My 3 year old also loves it, and can be heard saying 'crikey' all the time, which is hilarious!",1223424000,3,258,4.03921568627451

2874808,5,B000RPOCHK,"When I was in college watching these cartoons on Nickelodeon I found a way to get my friends interested in them as well. It's a variation of the drinking game ""Hi Bob"" from the old Bob Newhart show. I called it ""Penfold, shush"". Everytime someone says ""Penfold"" you take a sip of your drink. If they say ""Penfold, shush"" or some variation of that, you finish the drink. There are episodes that will kill you if you play by the rules. Seems wrong but it kept me from looking like the creepy old guy watching kids shows after class. And lets face it, beer is good.

I have always loved British comedy. I started with Monty Python and The Goodies on PBS and have never looked back. Dangermouse incorporated much of the same dry, British wit and also had an element of Bullwinkle to it as well. For years, the only versions I could find were on VHS, and even that was a chore. They were okay, but lacked much of the narrators commentary between episodes and had the more politically correct version of Stilletto (without the bad Italian accent. The DVD sets are fantastic. It's the original material in all it's glory. And now that my 4 year old has discovered them, I've got someone to watch Dangermouse and Penfold save the world from the nefarious Baron Greenback without having to get them drunk.",1211328000,37,1296,4.514893617021277

I'm nearly deaf and I'm american, so sometimes the language is a little hard to follow with the accents.
