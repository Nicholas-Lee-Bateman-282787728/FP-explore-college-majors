2529699,5,B000EQH26A,I've had this DVD for a year now and I still love watching it--I saw the show up at the Mondavi Center where it was taped.  Taiko Project is seriously one of the best taiko groups in the U.S.  They even won the Tokyo Taiko Contest last year and beat out like 50 Japanese taiko groups for First Place!,1142899200,10,300,4.067796610169491
8113319,5,B000EQH26A,"With a wonderful sense of self knowledge, these artists have applied the timeless values of Taiko to their modern identity and life.  We are so proud of them!",1389139200,,158,4.642857142857143
8113320,3,B000EQH26A,The video is fun to watch but I was a little disappointed by it overall.  It would be a good video to rent but I likely won't watch it again.,1316131200,,141,3.7
8113321,3,B000EQH26A,"I'm an old-school grumpy buddhist bastard, so
if you are young & socially-centric,
ignore my review,
but if you're old &
love the sublime forget-oneSELF / drumming BECOMES oneself Taiko,
then this review will likely make sense to you...

As a result of this DVD,
I now know there are at-least 2 major kinds of Taiko:

SOCIAL-taiko, to me the taiko of ""children""
( those who haven't found their deep roots, yet, whatever their age ), &

zen-TAIKO, the sublime push-oneself-until-there-is-no-SELF drumming.

Kodo sometimes gets the sublime TAIKO
( or perhaps I should say that some IN Kodo get it, and some don't )

This, however, is sooo socially-centric,
that they're paying as much attention to social-attention on them,
as they are to drumming!

Yes the enthusiasm is wonderful,
yes the Actually Doing It is excellent,
but this *isn't*, to an old buddhist,
TAIKO, all-capitalized...

---

As for the format of the DVD,
it is a mixture of performances, dedications, interviews, etc,
all interleaved,
so one can't sit through a drumming concert with this DVD,
unless one knows which chapters to select, and does so,
instead of auto-playing/wading through the whole thing...

informative, but it reduces the ""re-play"" enjoyment of it

( iow, I'd have organized it differently,
perhaps making 2 versions of it, one music/performance only,
the other *including* the music/performance,
but also including the interviews & dedications, etc... )

Yes I expect to get hated for knocking down a notch, the buzz about this,
but I HAVE to be loyal to what I know & love as
true, beyond-self TAIKO,
and this isn't it!

Blessings & Cheers,",1312156800,5,1627,5.007434944237918
8113322,5,B000EQH26A,"This is a delightful group. Energetic and cheerful and powerful. An assortment of styles are presented--a fusion with American scat and hip/hop, San Francisco style, San Jose style, etc. I really loved the duet that included two of the male drummers in ""fundoshi""--a white, twisted sort of thong that exposes the beauty of these athletic physiques and is not at all hard on the female eyes. :) Oh, sorry, where was I? heh...

And the performance of, oh--er--i forgot the title, but it's this WONDERFUL dance-with-drumming sequence with male and female performers taking turns with the Odaiko as well as clacking their bachis (drumsticks) as they go through a dancing routine that includes kneeling and stylized armwork. Very pretty.

The special features includes a subtitled look at the sort of verbal notation of sounds used by the drummers, including pauses. It is a resource for taiko drummers to replicate the performance. Very interesting.

For those who enjoy dance and theater, there is a piece with a stylized lion costume inhabited by a performer (and he does a terrific job) with two other masked dancers threatened by the beast--but with humor--as drummers do their thing in the background.

A beautiful sequence of excellent drumming and fine performances. I will watch this repeatedly. And I apologize that my knowledge of drumming and Japanese culture is so limited that I cannot do the descriptions justice. Just trust me and watch it. Lovely.

8113323,5,B000EQH26A,"As a taiko fan, these rising stars of taiko have been a pleasure to watch these past years since TP was formed. Having seen both Rhythmic Relations shows live, this DVD was definitely a treat--and the fact that it is treated as an entire stage production instead of only a musical performance makes it that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend this to anyone with even a vague interest in taiko, as it truly depicts the importance of taiko in the lives of the Japanese American community in the United States and these fabulous performers.",1222646400,,542,4.71578947368421
8113324,5,B000EQH26A,"I thoroughly enjoy this dvd of Kodo.  I fell in love with Taiko Drum music while living in California.  I watched Kodo on a PBS program.  I believe, it was Kodo at the Acropolis.  I have started a collection of Kodo dvds.  When I watch these taiko drummers, I realize what dedication means and it encourages me.  The music represents to me, my cultural heritage.  Sometimes I miss my home of Hawaii, and watching the drummers reminds me to be strong and face life as it comes.  I now live in Missouri, worlds away from Hawaii.  But thanks to Kodo, I am reminded of home.",1218585600,,570,4.352380952380952
8113325,4,B000EQH26A,"this dvd is entertaining for the drums alone. the players are a little cheesey. the perception of what they think american audiences want is a little cheesey. maybe perfect for children.nevertheless, a well rehearsed and talented group of people.",1181347200,,246,5.333333333333333
8113326,5,B000EQH26A,"Every single time I watch this DVD I learn something new.  The energy of this taiko group radiates through your television and you can feel their passion of taiko. I love it! I've seen a couple of their performances live and no matter if it's on TV or LIVE TAIKOPROJECT has the best combination of traditional and modern taiko.

The extras are even great. Clever way to interact with the dvd. And you get to learn OMIYAGE which is a gift to the taiko community. Thank you TAIKOPROJECT!!!",1164758400,7,487,4.5227272727272725
8113327,5,B000EQH26A,"TAIKOPROJECT is truly one of the preeminent taiko groups in the United States and the world!  The artists are young, energetic, innovative and creative, and their talent shines in this very special DVD.  Every time you watch it, you'll find new things to enjoy.  Their originality, combined with their technique and homage to traditional taiko, bring a freshness to their performances.  Whether you love taiko, or have never seen a live performance, TAIKOPROJECT: (re)generation is the show to see.",1159920000,4,498,5.265822784810126
8113328,4,B000EQH26A,"I have watched my copy of Taikoproject several times and each time I have enjoyed it all over again. The photography is not as sharp as it would have been had it been filmed in 2006 but the energy of the group and the excellence of the performances kept me glued to the screen. The final number is completely hypnotic and when it was over I was shouting ""encore"". I will be watching this dvd for years to come.",1151625600,7,410,4.2025316455696204
