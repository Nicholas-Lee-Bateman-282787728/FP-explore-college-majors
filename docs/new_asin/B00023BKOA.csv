8475504,4,B00023BKOA,Full of great information. Its fast passe keeps my kids attention. We do however feel we will need to watch it a few times to get all of the information to stick. Great for review. I would have given it 5 stars but I felt it was a little high on the price.,1462147200,,256,3.849056603773585
