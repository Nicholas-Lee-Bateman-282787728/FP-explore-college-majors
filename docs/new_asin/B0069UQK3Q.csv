4980999,4,B0069UQK3Q,I thought the movie was pretty awesome :),1432166400,,41,4.25
4981000,3,B0069UQK3Q,"Great Story, SubPar Performances, culminate in my 3 star review.  Crime is commited every day in New York, and the story follows the Men and Women who use unique, and sometimes shady, tactics to fight it. Although Fat Joe does make an appearance, the real Antagonist is Big Ed. Rather than focus on the story, I would simply like to quickly ask anyone interested in Police, and their side of things, to watch this movie. Put yourself in their shoes. Having a badge does not shield you from harm. I thought the story was good, and had some great moments. Give it a try, but overlook the ackward pauses, and perhaps you too, will find NARX a worthy B movie. Peace",1431648000,,661,4.462809917355372

4981004,1,B0069UQK3Q,Dont buy this DVD.  We bought it because it was recommended by the Police paper we get but it was a waste of money.  The money goes to families of deceased police officers but I would have rather send a donation.,1354147200,,212,4.146341463414634
