8345018,3,B001UTVP7M,"No one has ever overcome the difficulties in reducing to a cinematic presentation a phenomenon as complex as the French Revolution.  Probably no one ever will.  ""La revolution francaise,"" filmed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of that revolution, comes as close as any ever has or is likely to do, but it's still weakened by a number of factors including frequent and irritating cuts, which I can only assume were made to accommodate the film to a 2-disc format.

I first saw this film in 1989-90, when I was living in Toronto.  It was shown in original form on the French networks, and with subtitles on English networks.  I was impressed with its reach, even though that reach exceeded its grasp, and with its obvious intention to tell its audiences as much as possible in the amount of time allotted.  As I watch it again now, much of that laudable intention remains intact, but it also remains true that a much longer film would be needed to encompass all the historiographical niceties that need to be observed if a fully credible representation of the revolution were to be attempted.

The casting and acting are lamentably uneven, the latter clearly not helped by the need to dub the lines of non-francophone performers.  The outstanding performances are those of Claus Maria Brandauer as Georges Danton, Jean-Francois Balmer as a Louis XVI who is surprisingly sympathetic to the aims of the revolution in its earlier manifestations, and Andrzej Seweryn as Maximilien Robespierre, whose radical sympathies ultimately destroy his former political allies, leaving him brutally exposed to the enemies who bring him down.  Sam Neill, as the conflicted marquis de Lafayette, is unimpressive, as is Jane Seymour as Marie Antoinette.  (To be fair, the two latter are among the performances most adversely affected by dubbing.)

I was surprised and disappointed by the number of cuts in this DVD version.  Some scenes are eliminated altogether, while others are now interrupted in mid-stride or begin there, making hash out of the film's continuity.  The character most damaged in this way is Marie Antoinette, many of whose tribulations during the revolution are now unseen.  It is well known and attested, for example, that guards at the Temple prison were in the habit of blowing pipe smoke in her face as she went out of the building for the daily walk she and her family were allowed, and when she returned when the exercise period was done.  A scene in the original version of the film depicted such moments, and also showed the king and queen walking in the courtyard discussing the possibility of rescue by foreign armies.  That entire sequence is missing here.  Likewise, the queen's trial is interrupted at the very moment she rises, after the accusation against her that she practiced incest with her young son, to appeal to the mothers in the courtroom.  The historical record shows that this was a pivotal moment; Antoinette's anguished appeal abruptly swung the women's opinion in her favor and she was, briefly, cheered.  All that was shown in the original version, but all of it has been eliminated here. So has the film's account of the brutal last moments in the queen's cell when her guard refused to look away while she changed her undergarments; to preserve some shreds of modesty, she had to do so by crouching down next to the wall, shielded only by the maid who still served her.  That scene now begins only as the queen kneels down, but the viewer has no understanding of why she has to do so.  The queen's ride to the scaffold is also shortened; to torment her as much as possible, the route to the scaffold was extended to expose her to as much abuse as possible from the watching crowds.  The ride was graphically shown in the original version; here it takes barely 2 minutes, and we are denied even the vignette of the artist Jacques-Louis David making the famous sketch of her riding in the tumbril, which did appear in the original version.

As I said above, these cuts were probably implemented so the film could fit on 2 disks.  They rarely affect truly important events in the Revolution but, again as I noted earlier, they are confusing and damage the film's continuity.  More objectionable are certain representations that openly contradict the historical record.  Again to focus on Marie-Antoinette, simply because she is among the more prominent figures here, the film shows her observing the severed head of her friend, Mme de Lamballe, as it was paraded on a pike outside the queen's prison window.  This never happened.  To prevent the royal family maintaining contact with the outside world, the streetside windows of their prison were kept shuttered, so they could not see into the street.  Antoinette heard the tumult in the street outside, but didn't know what was happening; the king asked the guards to explain and was told that the crowd had come to show Antoinette her friend's head.  The queen did hear that, and fainted; but she never saw Lamballe's head.  (The graphic scene in the film notwithstanding, it is entirely untrue that Lamballe was tortured before her death; she was murdered and her body gruesomely dismembered, but she was not subjected to the kind of treatment the film suggests.)

The second major problem with this film's presentation of the revolution is its failure to address much of anything that happened outside Paris, which was the revolution's dominant political venue but not the whole of France, nor the whole of the revolution.  Nothing is presented here, for example, about the uprising in the Vendee nor the appalling measures that were taken to repress it. I was left, however unwillingly, with the feeling that the producers wanted to suggest that whatever Paris decided to do during the revolution was most important thing---and the right thing.  Another curious factor is the bloodlessness of death on the guillotine, one of the aspects of the French revolution with which many people are most familiar (and not without reason).  We see plenty of heads fall in the basket, but never a drop of blood.  This is peculiar; the superb film ""Danton"" with Gerard Depardieu, released in 1983, unashamedly displayed decapitation's horrific immediate aftermath, with blood falling from the scaffold onto the street below.  I can't understand why this film drew back from that realistic approach, unless it was a feeble attempt to downplay the violence into which the revolution ultimately descended.

What the viewer has here, then, is an occasionally impressive but unfortunately more often uneven film that ends up being less than the sum of its parts.  It's effective from moment to moment, but not consistently enough to merit more than 3 stars.",1397088000,7,6731,4.938775510204081
