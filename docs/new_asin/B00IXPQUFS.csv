6303940,5,B00IXPQUFS,"I grew up with Transformers in the 80s, watching the G1 cartoons every day religiously after I got home from school.  As a kid I found the stories entertaining albeit often very simplistic.  I longed for more complex storylines like those in some of the Marvel comics, that delved deeper into the characters and their motivations.  I got some of that with the 1986 animated film (Transformers the Movie) but still imagined that more could be done.

Many years later, as a thirtysomething adult, my wishes were fulfilled when I stumbled across Transformers Animated.  I hadn't thought about Transformers for many years but read some good press on the series and found some episodes floating around the web.  Pretty soon I was hooked.  The first two seasons were good albeit a little goofy, but Season 3 is where the storytelling really takes off.  Instead of a commercial for gimmicky action figures like the G1 series ultimately became, this whole series feels like a legitimate work of fiction in its own right.  The robot characters have complex motivations and very human failings, which makes them susceptible to pitfalls that lead to challenging moral questions.  The episodes all build upon each other to reach an epic conclusion.  Exciting endings are a challenging thing to create but this series nails it.

If you are at all interested in Transformers fiction, this IMHO is a great place to start.",1404259200,2,1406,4.9361702127659575
6303941,5,B00IXPQUFS,"I thought Season Three of Animated was by far the best, and would have loved this DVD four years ago. Kudos to Shout Factory for releasing Season Three by itself for those of us who purchased Seasons One and Two years ago, as well as the Complete Series. This series has possibly my favorite finale of any TF series.",1402531200,,316,4.372881355932203

8646084,5,B00IXPQUFS,Great series. Wish this had a Blu-ray release but worth owning. This is the best of the post-Bayverse TF cartoons. Pays lots of homage to G1. Has a great sleek and simple animation design too.,1509235200,,192,4.514285714285714
8646085,5,B00IXPQUFS,"I haven't seen this show since they aired the last show before they completely removed the line up. I did manage to buy season 1 and 2, including the one hour special that started it all. I waited years to season 3 to be in stores, when it did I didn't have the money to buy it, but now I have a second chance to purchase it and finally complete my collection.",1493596800,,360,4.013888888888889

8646091,4,B00IXPQUFS,"It's Transformers Animated Season 3! I didn't have cable TV at the time this series aired so the DVD release is the only way I got to see it, so pretty much I've been waiting five horrible years for this last season (aired 2009) to appear. (Okay, I watched them on YouTube around 2010 when it became obvious no release was forthcoming). But now my collection is complete, bwah hahahaha!

I've been a Transformers fan for a long time, but not all of the cartoon shows have interested me. I saw the ""G1"" show in the 80's of course but re-watching it as an adult is difficult. The most recent show, ""Prime"", takes itself too seriously, in my opinion. I loved ""Beast Wars"" for its sense of humor and how it felt like anything could happen to its small stranded cast. ""Animated"" jumps back and forth between serious and silly, it's a good show with fun, stylized character designs (that some fans hate, but kids don't care). Season Three largely dropped the ""human villain"" gimmick of the first couple years. Stories include further developments with their human friend Sari, more machinations from Megatron, attempts to capture the fugitive Wasp, and a unique story where the team is turned into humans. Unfortunately, the season ends on a cliffhanger.

Unlike the earlier DVDs of Seasons 1 & 2, this one is in widescreen for modern LCD TVs. (Don't get me started on all the other animated shows currently produced in widescreen that are being put out on DVD cropped to ""Full Screen"".) The concurrently released ""Complete Series"" is also in wide so you have an incentive to replace your old DVDs; I bought only season 3 'cos my finances aren't so hot these days and $10 (at Target) for 2 discs is easier to take than $30-35 for the whole smear. I'd appreciate a Blu-Ray release more anyway. Special features are limited to some audio commentaries. As a plus, the cover design is roughly the same as 1 & 2, so it won't look out of place on the shelf.

Edit: the only episodes with commentaries are the opening three-parter, ""Transwarped"".",1404604800,,2033,4.657381615598886
