8023032,1,B000260MQ4,"Four men are at a lodge preparing a meal for their female partners who are at a gym working out. They all get together later to discuss, mostly, their sexual relations and problems. Pretentious intellectuals discuss (lots of talk, talk, talk) sex and brag about their affairs. Awkward entanglements. Canadian movie in French with really bad, mismatched English dubbing. Boring, silly dialogue, amateurish acting. I know theres a deeper psychological meaning to this film, but its not worth the agony of having to watch this film to fully understand the point this film is trying to make. If you want an example of an artistically terrible movie, watch this. (Please dont.)",1470614400,,672,5.063063063063063
