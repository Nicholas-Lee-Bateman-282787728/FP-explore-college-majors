7030084,5,B00U7M7UPY,"AN EMOTIONAL AND ARTISTIC RENDERING APPROPRIATE TO THE SUBJECT  --- BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR EVERYONE

INCLUDES SDH SUBTITLES

This 2014 film depicts the latter part of the life of English painter J.M.W. Turner and is remarkable for more than just its dramatic portrayal.  The film absorbs some of the reputed surely personality of Turner himself and the use of light in the film's cinematography and landscape echo his paintings.  The film even seems to pause at moments to show us gorgeous views of seascape and landscape in haunting light from settings that also inspired Turner.  It is the cinematographer's ode to the painter.  The mood of the film is artistically brooding as was Turner (even occasionally abstract like his paintings) in that the story can slow to the background while simply expressing his personality in certain scenes. At other times the clouds part and we see the surprisingly touching and compassionate side of Turner that we also know existed.  This is something that is also a tribute to the tremendous acting talent of Timothy Spall as he embodies the personality of Turner, and expresses the director's artistic device in making the movie a microcosm of Turner and his work.

In terms of artistic expression of a real subject, this movie is a masterpiece.  Some readers here may be surprised to see widely varying reviews with even a fair amount of one stars.  I would like to explain a little further so each viewer can assess for themselves if this movie is for them.  The process of capturing the spirit and essence of Turner also means this is not necessarily the bright and happy period drama some unfamiliar viewers may expect.  As the boorish side of Turner is depicted, a few viewers may perceive the film in the same way.  The artistic expression and development means the story may not move as quickly as some might hope.  However, I appreciated the skillful device and am a great fan of the film.  I think understanding it before viewing will help people appreciate the movie more, or decide if it won't meet one's taste.  For example, the drawing room scene where Turner himself sings impromptu with a woman playing the piano is intentionally almost painful in a way, yet a bit humorous.  Turner's voice is brooding and very unpolished (I'm being kind), but his act is the softer side of his personality.  This well designed scene is an early hint from the movie that under Turner's crusty faade there is also a deeply poetic and loving spirit.  Those two sides are expressed at the exact same time in that scene.  For those like me who love the movie, I am not saying this to denigrate the film.  I mention it as an example of skillful filmmaking, while also warning some people just won't find it palatable.  I still felt the purpose was very well described by the end.

The performances in this film are absolutely exceptional.  Timothy Spall gives one of the performances of his career and Dorothy Atkinson as his housekeeper is one of the quietest, but most compelling characters of the entire film.  The occasional backdrops of landscape were gorgeous uses of light in cinematography and fitting homage to the painter. The Director states in the special features that the movie depicts the tension between the man and his own work.  I think it is an excellent expression of Turner's artistic style in general.",1426896000,67,3358,4.815008726003491
7030085,5,B00U7M7UPY,"Loved watching the faces. Many movies and TV shows feature faces, and hair and bodies (and clothes), carefully, continually, at cost, worked over, cosmetic surgeries included: so neat, symmetrical, tight, plastic smooth, pleasant yes, often not unattractive, but too often expressionless, or nearly so except for insipid smiles or frozen-face cool. Bland, dull.

Not in this film. We get faces, and bodies, lopsided, floppy, wrinkled, lumpy, blotchy, psoriasis-scarred, bad teeth, etc.. Hair unkempt, greasy, not perfectly in place. And expressions also which don't seem at all concerned with, self-conscious about, the view they present to the millions of us out here in medialand  no fashion model chic, no TV-commercial happy-pretty.

Without descending into mere satire or parody, we get a cornucopia, a feast of expressions, seemingly (artfully) spontaneous and sincere, eccentric only to us but not to each other, and as rich, as full as Turner's paintings with ""yellow mess"" (Queen Victoria's disparagement of a Turner work), with chaos, character, art, mystery, splendor both squalid and sublime. (I'll not soon forget housekeeper Hannah's face and its sad progress.)

P.S. Doesn't the sly performance, presentation of housekeeper Hannah raise the film to the level of pathos, tragedy? It's not grand spectacular tragedy in the manner of Oedipus or Hamlet. Nor in the manner of Bruegel the Elder's Icarus in which a sensational, heroic event and person end unnoticed by others in the frame. And not in the manner of Arthur Miller's Salesman in which the little person's tragedy gets large, loquacious treatment. But it's the tragedy, pathos of the unnoticeable hardly noticed, the unremarkable minimally remarked on. The mostly silent gets mostly silent treatment. Almost as when we casually slap away a bug. Little thought for a little thing. But who didn't notice? Who didn't (or won't) have just a little thought lingering long after about what's brushed over or smudged aside in that grand quest for ART?",1426464000,3,2016,5.350157728706624
7030086,5,B00U7M7UPY,"One of the highlights of a trip to London in 1971 (yes, during Nixon's infamous Wage-Price freeze) was the discovery of J.M.W. Turner's breath-taking art in both the Tate and British Museums. When commanded by a JayFlix.net participant to ""SEE THIS MOVIE!"" I did just that.

Written and directed by Mike Leigh (""Secrets & Lies""), this Oscar-nominated film has so many things to recommend it I don't know where to begin. I think I'll just itemize some of them.

  * Brilliant acting: Timothy Spall has mastered a growling grunt which tells us he is an impatient and rude fellow. In addition, the moment he walks into a scene, his unique stride tells us the same thing. Anyone who is a fan of Masterpiece Theatre will recognize a host of familiar faces.
  * Amazing landscapes: As a scene starts, it's impossible to tell if Dick Pope (Director of Photography) is introducing an actual location or one of Turner's paintings. Colors and locations in the UK are dazzling!
  * Unspoken emotions: We see Turner visit a brothel and use that sojourn to vent his unexpressed grief at his father's death. In addition, we see his devoted housemaid serve him in a variety of ways even as we see her health deteriorate and witness the spread of her horrific eczema.
  * Wonderful dialogue: In the movie theater, I had a Closed Caption device, so was able to relish an elegant use of the English language that is rarely used these days! But I had to look up scrofula!
  * Authentic production design: Never for a moment do we doubt that we are in the early 1800s. His equipment, transportation, clothing, medical attention and surroundings all are convincing.

Celebrated by the aristocracy and later satirized by the commoners, we follow the rise and fall (and rise again) of a genius who is the forerunner of Impressionism.

Our ""hero"" has no use for celebrity, nor will he yield to public tastes. This film is deservedly R-rated but offers the biography of a brilliant artist who never marries, travels incognito, has several associations with various women and spends his final 18 years in Chelsea with a widow named ""Mrs Booth."" It's hard to mourn the curmudgeon, but we cherish his legacy.",1426464000,118,2180,4.778666666666667
7030087,3,B00U7M7UPY,"At the risk of inviting a hailstorm of opposition, I must say that there were elements of this movie that were disturbing.  First, speaking to the good: the sets and costumes are fabulous!  For their sakes alone I wished I could watch the movie again.  In addition, there are several simply breath-taking shots of the ocean and coastline of England.  But then, sadly, we must deal with Mr. Spall's characterization of J.M.W. Turner.  Spall, you may recall, played Peter Pettigrew, who shape-shifted into Ron Weasley's rat, in the ""Harry Potter"" series of movies.  Sadly, it's a hard image to overcome.

The painted portrait of Turner shown on the Internet shows a fair-haired young man of pleasing countenance.  In contrast Spall, showing Turner in the latter third of his life, is scowling and unattractive in almost every way possible.  He's fat and slovenly.  In addition, he doesn't speak so much as growls or grunts reminiscent of a rooting hog.  In fact, Turner is portrayed as a man of few words, convivial only in the company of his fellow movers and shakers in the London Art World.  At home, contending with the rare visits of his former lover and their two illegitimate daughters, he is a cold, dismissive curmudgeon.  With his poor, weak-minded but loyal wretch of a housekeeper he is a brutish pig, fondling her and mounting her at will, then ordering her about without regard for her feelings.  Strangely, she doesn't seem to mind it, like a mis-treated dog loyal to the only master it has ever known, and she may even nurse an unrequited crush on her employer.  Even more distracting is an eczema-like rash seen slowly spreading from her neck to her face throughout the length of the movie.  What?  Is it a real disease of the times or is it a metaphor?

Turner journeys to Margate where he takes a room overlooking the ocean in a boarding house owned by a tirelessly optimistic woman and her aged husband.  Sophia Booth is any man's dream of the perfect wife: a practical and impeccable housekeeper possessed of a warm and loving disposition, a true care-taking personality coupled with a steadfastly pleasant demeanor.  I would have married her myself.  As it turns out, Turner developed a live-in arrangement with her after the death of her husband which lasted until Turner's death.  Inexplicably, she sees a kind and sensitive inner core beneath Turner's unkempt appearance and abrupt personality, a core that Spall failed to convey to me.  Au contraire, I found him singularly repellent.

Not so his artwork, of course, much of which is featured in this film, showing the inspirations for some of his greatest works.  The whole film is a visual feast, but if this was a realistic portrayal of Turner, The Man, then he was pretty awful.

There were a few directorial details that kept me at an arms-length distance, particularly in the early part of the film.  There is an overly long opening shot of two Dutch women walking along the bank of canal in Holland and chatting as Turner is shown above them, sketching the horizon.  The viewer is left waiting forsomething.which never materializes.  Then, the scene cuts to Turner's return to his London home (quite elegant, by the way, showing he was already a commercial success) and his warm welcome by his father with whom he was very close.  Their relationship is the only cue, other than Mrs. Booth, that Turner even has a heart.  The two men speak in such a thick dialect that they are almost unintelligible to the average American, and it took me about ten minutes before my ears adjusted to their speech, despite the fact I'm a confirmed watcher of BBC mystery shows on TV, and I thought I'd heard every British accent possible.  Lastly, the dialogue in the movie seemed stilted, particularly in the first half hour, and I thought perhaps it, and the movie, were developed intact from a stage play, as though I was watching a play within a movie.  This impression seemed to fade as the movie progressed.

All in all, I felt like I'd eaten at a four star restaurant only to come away having experienced a mediocre meal.  The table was exquisitely set, the food a visual feast, but the enjoyment and satisfaction were lacking.",1426377600,19,4198,4.775312066574203
7030088,5,B00U7M7UPY,"A wonderful portrayal of the life of the genius 19th century artist Joseph Mallord William ""J.M.W."" Turner. Timothy Spall spent over 2 years learning the fundamentals of painting so that he could take on this role and his acting is brilliant. Turner was truly ahead of his time,  a child prodigy and artistic visionary living through some of the most significant technological upheaval during his lifetime including the coming of steam and the invention of the first cameras. Mike Leigh's film touches on the artist coming to terms with this as well as exploring the other aspects of Turner's character throughout this life such as the denial of his children, a love-hate relationship with the Royal Academy and his later life romance, despite his strangely erratic communication skills.
A truly inspiring film.",1426291200,9,811,5.143939393939394

7030092,5,B00U7M7UPY,"There are few truly effective artist biopics and generally speaking, the greater the artist, the greater the chance of clich, over-reverence and hackneyed melodramatics. The filmmaker has the virtually impossible task of illuminating the greatness of the art while simultaneously not compromising it with a fleshing out of the man and the damaging encroachment of erroneous apocrypha (those things set in stone which everyone thinks they know about the subject). Mike Leigh delivers magnificently here in a film which embraces to stunning effect the central contradiction between J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851), the visionary English painter of sea and landscapes, and plain old Mr. Turner, the secretive, porcine curmudgeon who refused to support his old housekeeper Sarah Danby and the two children she bore him, and who possibly carried on sexual relations in the second half of his life simultaneously with two further women who he did not marry  his later housekeeper Hannah Danby (Sarahs niece) and Sophia Booth a merry soul twice widowed who he partly lived with in Chelsea in his final years. Leighs film is astonishingly well-acted, superbly shot by Dick Pope, beautifully scored by Gary Yershon (that insinuating clarinet theme) and is arresting from beginning to end in its celebration of Turners art and in its journey into the man behind it.

One can never fully replicate the astonishing sensory overload of standing in the Clore Gallery blown away by the incandescence of Turners great legacy, but with Pope Leigh comes as close as possible to achieving a visual texture that matches his subject. The film is studded with glorious sunrises and sunsets, starting in Flanders (Turner was a well-travelled man), moving through Margate, the River Thames (especially the  admittedly fictionalized  recreation of the sunset blazing behind the Fighting Temeraire as she is towed to the scrapyard) to the final moving depiction of the man painting in the early morning light after his death. Leigh skillfully matches his beautiful vistas of nature with Turners canvases. The artist observing an early steam-train billowing out smoke in the early morning mist magically leads into his famous work, Rain, Steam and Speed The Great Western Railway (1844), while close-ups of a canvas hanging on the Royal Academy wall with Turner furiously layering on white paint dissolves magnificently into real white cliffs as he walks along the seashore.

With Leighs production designer Suzie Davies working wonders on a (by Hollywood standards) miniscule budget, early Victorian England is convincingly rendered with short exterior urban scenes alternating with longer country scenes and even longer interior sequences. Theres one absolutely stupendous set depicting the interior of the Royal Academy exhibition room with every inch of wall-space crammed with glorious canvases created by the greatest British names of the day. Rather than give in to the temptation to make a simple heritage picture, Leigh uses his locations and sets as a backdrop to emphasize Turners greatness through a careful depiction of the social milieu he inhabited. The Royal Academy scene is a perfect example of this in the way it underlines Turner as both a traditionalist (he loved the Academy and actually taught there for many years) and a renegade as he rudely strides about issuing greetings and advice in equal abundance as everyone listens to the undisputed master of the day. We get very skillful vignettes of famous painters of the time from Benjamin Haydon (Martin Savage) to George Jones (Richard Bremmer), and an absolute gem of a scene with John Constable (James Fleet) who is put down with one rude stab of red paint. This is a scene which ostensibly works on tired clich (the mad artist) and we may groan, but process it a second and we see Leighs point which is to underline the central difference between the two greatest English Romantic painters that many people might not know  one was fastidious and worked very slowly toiling over his canvases leading to a small output while the other worked at lightning pace on the inspiration of the moment leading to an extensive legacy of work.

As per usual Leigh worked without a script, but he does organize the narrative tightly around sequences which make clear various facets of the great artist. Turners inquisitiveness and ability to take onboard new concepts and ideas is shown by in the visit of Mary Somerville (Lesley Manville), the famous scientist (at a time when women were not tolerated in the profession) who conducts an experiment which confirms Turners belief that everything in the universe is somehow connected. And then theres Turners visit to J. E. Mayall (Leo Bill), a pioneering photographer whose camera provokes endless questions and the correct prediction that one day everyone will one day wander the world with cameras as opposed to portfolios. The scene is lengthy and seems to connect with Leigh dwelling on the very origins of cinematography. We also get a fair grasp of Turners understanding of the monstrous capabilities of the human species when the origins of his canvas The Slave Ship (1840) are laid out through a chat with an old sailor who used to work on slave traders.

Those who know Leigh will be familiar with his fascination with social class and this bursts to the fore in a hilarious scene where the working class son of a Covent Garden barber puts down the stinking rich mummys boy toff John Ruskin (wonderfully played by Joshua McGuire), a distinguished art critic at the time and Turners greatest champion. Leigh takes Ruskins priggish reputation and has a bit of fun at his expense in a conversation which reveals that he knows not the difference between a Claude Lorrain and a steak and kidney pie. This scene may be interpreted as Leigh having a dig at his own critics, and it may also be linked with the unfortunate penchant of stereotyping toffs which mars some of his work (especially for me Vera Drake, an otherwise impeccable film), but Ruskin pays a small role and there are other upper class figures including Queen Victoria and Prince Albert themselves who are treated sympathetically and balance the total picture. Her Majesty might dismiss Turners painting as A yellow mess, but she at least recognizes the artists work on sight which is a lot more than can be said for the artists whose work surround it.

Whenever I watch a Mike Leigh film I am always astonished by the results of his famous method which has actors immersing themselves in their roles for months or even years to the extent that when they are before the cameras without a script they are able to just be the very people they have been asked to play. They inhabit the screen to a degree which is almost frighteningly real. The fact that the speech in this film is also Dickensian and requires actors to have a real knowledge of his language as well as their characters makes the final result even more impressive. There are several extraordinary performances (incarnations?  performance suggests an element of pretense unsuited here) in this film topped of course by Timothy Spalls marvelous Turner. He studied painting for 2 years before he went before the camera and his portrait of Turner as a bent over, wheezy, cantankerous, inarticulate (Dickensian English filtered through a guttural cockney accent), feral beast with a penchant for grunting animal noises is as believable as acting ever gets. Leigh plays the last 25 years of Turners life as a take two tale of the artist first watching his father William (Paul Jesson) die all stuffed up with bronchial problems and then the artist gradually meeting his maker in the same fashion. Turner is at his most lovable when with his father and Spall and Jessons sparring off each other is a delight. Also anchoring the main story are the three stories that make up Turners love-life, past (Ruth Sheen spellbinding in her affronted indignation) and present. It is the contrast between Turners use (and abuse?) of Hannah Danby (Dorothy Atkinson) in love with her master but fading away in loneliness and psoriasis (a skin disease), and the cheerful ever-optimistic Sophia Booth (Marion Bailey) equally in love with her man (the sunrise he never painted perhaps) which paints in a background which clarifies and humanizes the central subject with true conviction. The performances of both Atkinson and Bailey are deeply affecting and the way Leigh closes his film to underline the closing of two love stories is heart-breaking. I can write at great length about narrative structure, themes and ideas, but when it comes to acting I am really at a loss as to how to really do justice to their craft. For most directors they are simply deployed to say their lines and do what is expected, but in Leighs hands they are co-creators and he is as reliant on them as they are on him. When the chemistry is there (as it obviously is here) the results are breath-taking and I can do little more than put my pen aside. Like other top drawer Leigh, this is a film to be seen and seen again.",1509926400,,9091,4.975

That the sun is god

Bring me my sketch book.

Lashed to the mast-
One cannot fear death
No more than sausage;
Miraculous light;
I want to be obsessed by light
Like Turner- the light on steps/seascapes
I want to run from my death bed
Because of some new slant
Of light, that recognition!!!
Recognition of light,
Last words of light
Good bye to light.

7030123,4,B00U7M7UPY,"4 1/2 stars -- James William Mallord Turner (1775-1851) was some kind of great man and certainly a great painter -- as great a one as England ever produced -- and there are elements in his life that make him an intriguing subject for a movie.  In particular., he lived an odd double-life and maintained two abodes for reasons that had nothing to do with criminal activity or the need to hide secrets.  Mike Leigh's movie focuses on the last 26 years of his life, from about the time of the death of Turner's father, to whom he was close and who served as his helper in getting and preparing paint and canvases.  The movie suggests -- without feeling the need to explain anything -- that his father's death initiates the double life and causes him to leave his home and the female servant Hannah Danby (Dorothy Atkinson), whose relation to him is at times sexual) and take up with Sophia Booth (Marion Bailey), a twice-widowed landlady in Margate on the south coast of England where he loves to paint.  The Turner we see making these moves is an awkward, shambling, rather unkempt figure, given to grunting and snuffling, but effortlessly capable of times of kindness and an elegance of language that is always surprising.  Then there's yet another Turner, still a bit unkempt, who treads the halls of the Royal Academy in London, is respected and perhaps somewhat envied and feared by his fellow-artists, with whom he interacts easily, as he does also with members of the aristocracy who are patrons of art.  In these interactions, he's never polished, but he is absolutely comfortable, speaks with wit and precision, and seems to enjoy his esteem and status as a member of the Royal Academy, even if the young Queen Victoria is condescendingly sniffy about his work.  In other words, he's a genius, and even a bit of a wild man, who is not in the least ""alienated"" as an artist from his social world and his peers, no matter how awkward and murky his private life is.

Mike Leigh's main focus, though, is on the artist -- Turner striding along with his equipment, in Margate, London, and elsewhere, is a constant visual motif, the stride getting a bit more labored as he gets older.  As an artist, he always seems to know where he's going and why, and Leigh goes to great lengths to let us see Turner in relation to the real situations out of which grew the great pictures like ""The Fighting Temeraire"" and ""Rain, Steam, and Speed.""  The cinematographer Dick Pope won an award at Cannes for the look of this movie -- the way his shots of the scenes seem at times as textured as the paintings that Turner would make is unusual and very effective, and his ability to capture onscreen the ways that sunlight and water appear in Turner's paintings is uncanny.  Timothy Spall also won an award at Cannes for his portrayal of Turner, and it is quite an achievement -- one of the great screen performances, I think, for an actor who is as compelling as he is unglamorous. What went into it in terms of preparation over years is indicated in a ""special feature"" that comes with the DVD, and it really is essential viewing if you know little of Turner, or of Mike Leigh's methods.  The other actors, especially the women, are excellent too.  The men who play Turner's fellow artists are essentially in cameos, but each is distinctive.  The exception is Benjamin Robert Haydon (1786-1846), played by Martin Savage.  Haydon owes Turner money, insists on painting second-rate historical canvases -- and yet Turner  supports him and always insists that he should paint what he wants.  Their last scene together is very well done.

A great subject, then, with great acting and cinematography -- but maybe not quite a great movie, albeit an intelligent and very interesting one.  What are the limits?  First of all, the narrative element of interest -- the multiple lives -- is basically simple, and it stretches out over 150 minutes without surprising us much in the later stages.  A bigger drawback for some viewers will be the fact that Mike Leigh assumes our prior interest in, and some knowledge of, Turner's times and paintings.  For example, the whole scene on the water involving the Temeraire assumes that you know that painting already -- and if you don't, you might be at a bit of a loss.  For all that, though, it remains true that Mike Leigh has never made a bad, uninteresting movie or one that isn't engaging to look at.  Read up a bit on Turner, google some of his paintings, then see this!",1478736000,,4492,4.649810366624526
7030124,4,B00U7M7UPY,"This wasn't a Hollywood movie.  I think the movie is simply looking at Turner through his own eyes.  An unblinking and unromantic portrait set to an unromantic score.  I can't help thinking the actors cast in the movie look like people Turner might have painted.  And I thought it was funny how he laughed at Pre-Raphaelite Millais' paintings while his greatest masterpieces were exhibited in the anti room, as he also hangs in the Tate.  If you know what to look for, the movie tells you a lot about JMW Turner.

The episodes in the Royal Academy were instructive, but really?? allowing Mr. T to deface art as it is presented under RA sponsorship???  Can that be true??  There was nothing about the person, as pitched, which would entice me to invite him as a houseguest to Petworth more than once.  The snorting??? How to develop such a character?  The cognitive dissonance between himself and his conquests really defies imagination.

 If any of this is true, then we must separate the man from his art.  But methinks credibility was sacrificed for crudity and the tale.",1478217600,,708,4.816666666666666

The slow pace, the great acting, beautiful photography and realistic feel of the historic settings add a lot to the appeal of this film, and it shows some lovely scenes of Turner in front of the canvas. But what truly motivated him as an artist, and how he developed his unique style remains untold. The story starts when he is already quite old and an established artist, and follows him until his death. The viewer observes everything he does during this time, but we are never allowed inside his mind, never quite get close enough, always remain on the outside. At least that's how I felt when I watched it, and it is a shame because someone who speaks so eloquently through his art must have had a deep and interesting mind and personality. And Timothy Spall isn't allowed to do much more than look grumpy and grunt - a different director might have allowed his main character to have more color.",1476662400,6,1022,4.590163934426229

In fact, although Turner could be unfriendly and difficult to some, pictures of him by his contemporaries reveal a relatively handsome man (over-weight, but quite unlike Spall) and letters have shown him to be kind and very civilized when among friends or children.  For a less insulting and seemingly more authentic portrayal of Turner, see Leo McKern's ""The Sun is God, The Life of J M W Turner ""(1979), which presents Turner as a sensitive artist rather than a clumsy caricature. It is unfortunate that viewers unfamiliar with the real Turner, should take Leigh's and Spall's Turner as the real thing.

It wants to be honest that he was not a good husband or a satisfactory father. It seems he separated from his wife and this caused her distress and hardship.

But there is really no need to show him behaving like a bull mounting a cow in a field. without warning and standing up, This is mere crudity. If the point is that he made use of her and gave her nothing emotionally or financially, that point could be more subtly made. He is shown as generally gruff and blunt with no social graces.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: One Old Master deserves another. And so it is that one of the finest films of 2014 finds English filmmaker Mike Leigh taking as his subject English painter J.M.W. Turner. Mr. Turner, like Mike Leigh's equally sublime Topsy-Turvy, revives an era in astonishing, delicate detail, then moves through the space with a documentarian's eye. Mike Leigh takes Mr. J.M.W. Turner out of art history and puts him back in the world.

MR. TURNER [2014] gives Director Mike Leighs Academy Award-nominated biographical drama arrives in the high-definition Blu-ray format to give viewers the definitive look at the celebrated 19th century British Romanticist landscape painter Mr. J.M.W. Turner.

On their surfaces, Mike Leigh and Mr. J.M.W. Turner, the artist at the centre of this Mike Leigh film, and Mr. J.M.W. Turner could not seem more like polar opposites. The 19th-century English painter created colossal landscapes of ships and seas, odd impressions that feature little in terms of human life. Mike Leigh, the director of Naked, Topsy-Turvy and Another Year really works on a microcosmic scale, investigating psychology through dialogue and camera movement, finding precise moments at which the human shell can break. But both are perceptibly searching for the in-between or, as one character in the film suggests, turning particles into chaos. These two artists search for the essence of life through the blending of the material building blocks of the world, offering much to ponder without necessarily asserting their own importance. Even if the artist is a fool, the work will always stand.

Specifically looking at the last 25 years of his life, the meticulously researched costume period film starred Timothy Spall as Mr. J.M.W. Turner. The devoted actor brings to life the rotund, grumbling curmudgeon so authentically that he actually spent two years learning how to paint in preparation for the role. The true co-star of the 150 minutes effort is cinematographer Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C. who borrowed Mr. J.M.W. Turners colour pallet when crafting the beautiful look of the film. The digital transfer breathtakingly reveals the result and is most apparent during every one of Dick Popes outdoor, landscape shots.

Mike Leigh's role as cultural historian more commonly focuses on contemporary life in lower-middle-class English low life people, but his obvious fascination with and affection for his fellow artists, perhaps especially the grouchy ones, and their pains are evident. Though Leigh isn't likely quite as cantankerous as Mr. J.M.W. Turner, he's well qualified to see Mr. J.M.W. Turner for his faults as well as his genius, to understand both and guide his cast through a well-honed process of improvisatory rehearsal to arrive at life's reflection caught on camera.

Mike Leigh opens on a beautiful landscape with river and windmill, and soon enough, we see the man regarding it with a thoughtful scowl. This is what passes for peacefulness for Mr. J.M.W. Turner [Timothy Spall], who only seems truly happy in the merry company of his beloved father [Paul Jesson]. A coarse, grunting grump, Turner nevertheless remains consistently, quietly, compulsively driven to paint his landscapes and his seascapes, and to perfect his form through thoughtful regard and restless experimentation.

Mr. J.M.W. Turner is as much about a way of viewing as it is about Mr. J.M.W. Turner, and it's fascinating to enjoy Mike Leigh's entirely distinct viewpoint and technique in dialogue with Mr. J.M.W. Turner's. Mike Leigh is a dedicated, unblinking observer not of nature but of human nature, and he allows us to draw our own conclusions about what he shows us of Mr. J.M.W. Turner's topsy-turvy interactions with his world and his peers: his deep love of his father but his denial of his own illegitimate children, his sensitivity to nature and his brusqueness with people, including his sexual exploitation of women and disinterest in marriage, his total dedication to art and his iconoclasm within the English art world, dominated by the standing-on-ceremony Royal Academy of Arts.

This tension drives Mike Leighs portrait as the artist travels around England, capturing the most gorgeous of landscapes in an early form of impressionism in the Romantic Era. Mr. J.M.W. Turner becomes essentially obsessed the paradox of the sublime of the landscape and fitting for an artist with a love of modesty while abhorring class and social intellectualism. Mr. J.M.W. Turner constantly rejects any chances to enter the upper crust of society, mocking both high-minded intellectuals and a sequence with a young, high-minded Mister Ruskin, who resembles your freshman seminars worst nightmare, is one of the films hilarious highlights and those who cannot truly appreciate their art, instead seeing it as grotesque. Turner even defies the process of art as some beautiful craft by throwing his paintings together in blunt gestures and with non-traditional materials. In one magnificent sequence, Mr. J.M.W. Turner mocks a fellow tinkerer by splashing a giant slob of red paint right into the middle of his piece, leaving everyone in disbelief until he returns to transform the slob into a gorgeous buoy.

Mike Leigh's narrative approach tends to the episodic, with little interest in conventional ""drama"" and every interest in nuances of behaviour and meaning, applied with gentle brushstrokes. Just as Mr. J.M.W. Turner had a penchant for moving incognito, Mike Leigh wants to be a fly on the wall of history as his time-travels through Turner's last quarter-century of life, up to and a bit beyond his ""famous last words."" The collage of scenes accumulates M. J.M.W. Turner's character, from moments of great emotional impact to those of passing fancy, like Mr. J.M.W. Turner's fascinated encounter with a camera: wondrous new technology destined to evolve into the vehicle of Mr. J.M.W. Turner itself.

It is a gorgeous world that Mr. J.M.W. Turner encounters, even if Turner is not. Leighs camera searches this world through slow and ponderous movements; every gesture by an actor as carefully calculated as the forceful actions Mr. J.M.W. Turner throws onto his canvases. Director Mike Leigh and regular Director of Cinematography Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C. zoom around these magnificently art-directed spaces, often focusing on the windows that become the magnificent landscapes of Mr. J.M.W. Turners canvases and magnificently staged through the long takes sequences that define the essence of Mr. J.M.W. Turner. They appear only rarely, but the precise timing of the edits and changes in composition highlight the unspoken psychology of the characters with piercing honesty; an early piano duet between Mr. J.M.W. Turner and a woman takes on sensual qualities simply through the careful positioning of director Mike Leigh that interacts between the two characters.

Mr. J.M.W. Turner has been often been quoted and described as ""painting with light,"" a terminology also applied to the art of cinematography. Accordingly, Mike Leigh's right-hand man Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C. delivers the most stunning cinematic images, like the paintings of Mr. J.M.W. Turner, which rightly of course collected the Best Cinematography Oscar Award. But no less deserving, is the actor Timothy Spall, who sadly only garnered a couple of Nominations for Best Actor, who has always been a career character actor and Mike Leigh insight into the life and times of Mr. J.M.W. Turner with a rare totality of presence, with a depth that insists that we love Mr. J.M.W. Turner, despite his many warts, for being so thoroughly, unapologetically himself; for being redeemed by love and vocation; for having, like Mike Leigh and Timothy Spall, the soul of an artist.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Entertainment One has done us proud with releasing one of the best films of 2014 with this Blu-ray disc edition. The 1080p encoded hi-definition digital-to-digital transfer ably handles the year's best cinematography and the lovely evocation of Mr. J.M.W. Turner's worlds on and off the canvas that excels in rich hues and bracingly sharp detail, especially in texture of the materials used in the film. Anchored by a rock-solid black level, the pretty picture loses nothing in translation to what you view. This Blu-ray of the film MR. TURNER is presented as gorgeous and impressive images as I have seen in a very long time. We hear that Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C.s approach to the film was primarily to evoke the stunning approach to the man and his paintings, and not only just to witness in seeing the artist reproduce his works. To do this Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C. sought to find a way to use the same kind of palette and colouring as Mr. J.M.W. Turners paintings for the film. Mr. J.M.W. Turner used warm yellow in the highlights and blue/teal in the shadows as his two main complementary colours. Indeed this seems to be borne out by the chart of colour pigments available to him at the time and as displayed at Tate Britain. Mr. J.M.W. Turners use of these two complimentary colours adheres very well to colour grading theory, in that if you add yellow to your highlights and blue to your shadows, basically split toning the highlights and shadows, you change the world around the subject but skin tones remain the same. And kudos of course goes to Dan Taylor's Art Direction, Charlotte Watts's Set Decoration and the Costume Design by Jacqueline Durran. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Entertainment One has given us in the audio department, the brilliant and wonderful 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix that does not miss a beat in its clarity and immersive soundscape. Discrete placement of sound effects in the mix strongly but subtly evokes period and place while clearly prioritising dialogue and giving a full treatment to music when present. The impressive score was done by Gary Yershon, who Mike Leigh's used in the excellent film Happy-Go-Lucky, and augmented by Henry Purcell's Dido's Lament from the Opera ""Dido and Aenas"" and Beethoven's ""Sonata Path&eacute;tique."" This is where the track sounds rich and wonderful and the atmospheric score helps the classic mood for the period of the film itself. The only slightly negative aspect to the audio presentation is that sometimes Timothy Spall sort of grunts and his speech sometimes is not quite clear and at times I had to turn up the volume.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Making of The Many Colours of Mr. Turner [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1 / 1.78:1] [30:32] Here we have a look at the long process of getting the film from idea to screen, a glimpse into production meetings, Mr. J.M.W. Turner's period and style, his character contrasts, secondary characters and their relationships with Mr. J.M.W. Turner, the core events of the timeframe the film depicts, Timothy Spall's painting tutorials, costumes and shooting locations, borrowed and replicated art and images, the cast and their characters, sets and shooting locations, and much more. We also get some of the filmmakers, including director Mike Leigh, discussing the production hurdles and desired look, which helped to make the film look rich and totally satisfying experience. At the start of this wonderful intimate documentary, Mike Leigh talks about why he wanted to make the film MR. TURNER, which came about just after finishing the film TOPSY-TURVY, and at the same time Mike Leigh was reading the autobiography about Mr. J.M.W. Turner and felt his paintings were very cinematic. Mike Leigh also felt the character of Mr. J.M.W. Turner was a very complex character that was ideal to be made into a film and they battled for many years to get the film off the ground. Georgina Lowe [Producer] also tells us that they were so keen to make the film and when they went to the Cannes Film Festival with the Mike Leigh film ANOTHER YEAR [2010] it was there that they announced they were going to make the film MR. TURNER, and in order to also try and raise the funds to make the film. Richard ""Dick"" Pope, B.S.C. [Director of Photography] informs us that he felt the film was not about a portrait painter or someone who is not into still life, it is more about a painter who likes a broad canvas that are visually widescreen in dimension, as well as being epic about his work. We get to visit Wentworth Woodhouse [Grade I listed country house] that is situated in the village of Wentworth, near Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England, which they use as the location for the Royal Academy of Arts, which was an art institution based in Burlington House on Piccadilly in London in 1768, but is now housed in Somerset House, which is now located in the Strand, City of Westminster in London. Timothy Spall [Mr. J.W.M. Turner] tells us that when he lived in Battersea in London as a child he had never heard of the painter Mr. J.W.M. Turner, which is a sort of stone throw away from the Tate Gallery which Timothy use to visit and while wandering around eventually came upon Mr. J.M.W. Turner amazing paintings, which at first Timothy thought they were Impressionist paintings, which of course was a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists, but eventually realised the painter was English and was bowled over by what Timothy Spall witnessed, but despite that at the time he did not know much about Mr. J.W.M. Turner. We also find out that Mr. J.W.M. Turner was a very hard and dedicated towards his artistic work and because of his dedication there are estimated to be at least 20,000 paintings, which also includes personal drawings and sketches. We find out from Jacqueline Riding [Consultant Art Historian] that Mr. J.W.M. Turner is a man of his training of the Georgian period, although many people have described him as a Victorian artist, and this period was when Romantic British Landscape paintings really came into their own, because over on the Continent of Europe there were wars going on, so artists would travel more and more around the United Kingdom. Timothy Spall says that he had read around 20 to 30 books on the artist Mr. J.W.M. Turner, especially the biographies and especially what other artists influenced Mr. J.W.M. Turner. We find out from Paul Jesson [William Turner] that the Father was successful businessman as a barber and wig maker, but by the end of the 18th century his wig business was in decline and that is why he wanted to dedicate his son into pursuing a career as an artist. When Timothy Spall started to look into his character he was to play, Timothy did a lot of detective work on the life and times of Mr. J.W.M. Turner and how this person worked. Mike Leigh tells us that the film looked at the last 20 years of the artists life and the relationship he had with the Margate landlady Mrs. Booth, which was a great influence in the life of the artist, but sadly people at the time did not understand his paintings, especially Queen Victoria. Marion Bailey [Sophia Booth] talks about her character as Mrs. Booth and there is a lot of information about this particular woman and her involvement with the artist Mr. J.W.M. Turner, who dedicated her life to Mr. J.W.M. Turner and in his well-being and Mr. J.W.M. Turner found great peace with Mrs. Booth. Dorothy Atkins [Hannah Danby] was the niece of Sarah Danby and went to work for Mr. J.W.M. Turner at the age of 23 years of age, and Sarah Danby was the first mistress of Mr. J.W.M. Turner and Hannah Darby stayed loyal to the artist for 40 years as his housekeeper and was left the house which was in the will, but died a year after the death of the artist. The reason Mike Leigh wanted to make the film on the life and times of Mr. J.W.M. Turner was because he felt the man was honest, dishonest, totally truthful and thoroughly disingenuous, who also liked to embrace the truth, but sadly was in total denial with his children. Mr. J.W.M. Turner was also a person who was very emotionally upfront and at the same time could be very difficult. Here we get to see Timothy Spall with his painting tutor Tim Wright and teaching how to paint like Mr. J.W.M. Turner and try to make him feel like the 18th Century painter and Timothy Spall spent well over 2 years learning how to paint like Mr. J.W.M. Turner and Timothy found it very difficult to concentrate while being filmed and also had 56 people watching him while being filmed, but even more so having Mike leigh watching him also and over time Timothy got more confident. We also get to meet the artist Charlie Cobb who prepared the paintings that Timothy Spall would work on and you see how the paintings were prepared and when you see the finished paintings, they are of course only reproductions. Timothy Spall was really bowled over by Suzie Davies [Production Designer] and her work in making the Royal Academy of Arts look real and seeing all of the paintings on the walls and ceilings, which were able to be recreated because they had the original catalogue of the actual layout of the paintings in the 18th Century. We meet Jane Brodie [Art Department Assistant] and talks about the involvement in the film and we find out that they had to display over 250 paintings to recreate the look of the real thing and if they had to actually recreate the paintings for real, it would have taken them to paint four paintings a day, but instead Mike Leigh and his team contacted as many people who had the original painting around the world and loaned the paintings out free of charge. We also meet the other actors who were representing the artists in the film and they were Fred pearson [Sir William Beechey]; Roger Ashton-Griffiths [Henry William Pickersgill]; Clive Francis [Sir Martin Archer Shee]; Tom Edden [Charles Robert Leslie]; Jamie Thomas King [David Roberts]; Mark Stanley [Clarkson Frederick Stanfield] and Martin Savage [Benjamin Robert Haydon]. They eventually found this old house in Woolwich in London to represent Mr. J.W.M. Turner home which was luckily empty and they gutted the whole place and painted it in the colours of the time, which helped Timothy Spall get into character. We also go on location to Pentworth House, which is in the parish of Petworth, West Sussex, England, and is a late 17th-century Grade I listed country house that Mr. J.W.M. Turner use to visit a lot and the national Trust were very helpful in allowing them to film inside the building, especially as there are loads of paintings by Mr. J.W.M. Turner on the walls, so giving it so much more authentic provenance for the film. All the cast and crew were asked to name their favourite Mr. J.W.M. Turner painting, and it was very difficult to name one, as there were far too many to choose, but most liked the scenes of the storms and seascapes. So all in all this was a very fascinating documentary on Mr. J.W.M. Turner and of course the film MR. TURNER, but we also got a fascinating look behind-the-scenes on the making of MR. TURNER.

Theatrical Trailers: You get to view four trailers when the Blu-ray has loaded up, and they are as follows: SUITE FRANAISE [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:16]; THE WATER DIVINER [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:36]; THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1.59] and THE HOMESMAN [2014] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1.59].

Finally, Mike Leigh is one of the best filmmakers and director working today and MR. TURNER is right up there with Topsy-Turvy as one of his biggest undertakings ever in terms of size. But it does not quite have the narrative of the brilliant Topsy-Turvy film, relying more on cinematic atmosphere than actual narrative and sometimes such an approach can result in great things. Running for two-and-a-half hours, the conversations and gestures in Mr. J.M.W. Turner are packed with such intense thoughts, while never taking on a sense of grand proportions, that attempting to take it all in on a single viewing can prove overwhelming. Contemplating the sublime, especially one with such deceptive crevasses, may require a lifetime. And the films final turn toward the age of mechanical art  steam engines and, most frightening to Mr. J.M.W. Turner, photography and places him in a context of a man caught in the wrong time. Its not that these sequences lack the majestic rigor of Leighs artful camera movements, but that Mr. J.M.W. Turners most refreshing aspect, an elusiveness of meaning, evaporates in order to bring closure to the character and the film. Highly Recommended!

7030154,5,B00U7M7UPY,"There is a cosy charm of domestic bliss in the Turner household as comfortable as an old pair of boots. Under the watchful and darting eyes of a mousey and twitchy housekeeper, the old and senior Mr Turner, and the aging JMW Turner, tag along together -agreeably well, and enjoy morsels of meat and discuss measurements of canvas.

The film appears as a colourful slideshow of moving images in picturesque details of striking and visual colour - and I loved the opening scene briefly set in the marshlands of Holland. JMW Turner is ideally played by Timothy Spall gruff; stout: focused he struts along and grunts his way to impose his authority.

Overall, the film has to be admired rather than be criticised: overly long, with repeated episodes of trips to Margate  but here we are rewarded with the seascape of orange sunsets with boats and ship: with a curious mix of fisherman, and locals with rich dialects.

The film could be described as a study of an aging JMW in domestic life. A slowly paced film with occasional meetings of fellow artists at the Royal Academy: and a fleeting scene with a moody John Constable. We get to see and study all sorts of characters....an impetuous and pretentious John Ruskin....the oddity of the housekeeper Hanna Danby....moments of intimacy with the landlady in Margate  and oddly again....strong encounters with his estranged family who visit JMW in London?

I think I get the picture: and will be happy to view again for its visual content and stunning details -with the accompanying sounds of violin as background music to the film score: The film itself has a calming, but a sleeping affect as though we are on holiday in extended time on a visual treat of art from a bygone age? Timothy Spall captivates the temperament of JMW Turner, and we are drawn in fascination to his character.",1465603200,,1830,4.775316455696203

7030156,2,B00U7M7UPY,"""It's NOT you; it Me. I just simply unable to connect. I am sorry. Goodbye""  How does a person explain that she was totally unable to watch a film about her lifetime artist because it did not engage her and that it is hard to describe the reason why? This low score only reflects my feelings about the story in that I was not able to engage with it sufficiently to watch more than 30 minutes.

 I was not able to emotionally engage with the film, even though it looked great. The actors were quiet believable in their roles and I am a long time fan of Timothy Spall. The scenery was - as always in England - extremely beautiful because that is the nature of the English countryside, in that it is always a draw.

JMW Turner has been my favorite artist for several decades and I was excited about seeing a film about his life.  For whatever reason, I was simply not able to emotionally engage with this movie and turned it off after a half hour.

I am sure that I would have stayed if the story had been about the years of his beginning and early successes, rather than only his last couple decades. As a person who has painted for most of sixty+ years, I am still more interested in the efforts and experiences that bring discovery than in the places which are easily achieves and there is no struggle.

But, again, this is totally an emotional response to the subject and the film may be most enjoyable for others.",1464134400,,1415,4.316981132075472

Hollywood sex at the expense of the truth. Not much is known about Turner's personal life, and it's his personal life that this movie promotes. Since the 1970s Hollywood promotes the depraved as the model of humankind, replacing the ideal. Turner loved the poetic and brought Claude and idealization into his work.

If one accepts that Turner preferred grunting to talking or that Ruskin was a horrible bore, that viewer might still feel that the pace of the film is so slow and the film is too dependent on the moods of characters with their backs to the camera. All in all, I think I'd prefer to see Simon Schama's episode about Turner in his Power of Art series -- or better yet, go to a museum that has some works by Turner.",1459382400,2,565,4.339622641509434

7030174,1,B00U7M7UPY,"I am a great fan of Turner's art, but this movie was the most boring, incoherent and uninformative art movie I've ever seen.  I thought the movie would be about his art and his development as an artist, but it was not.  The lead actor grunted and mumbled a great deal and was impossible (at least for me) to understand without subtitles.  Many of the other characters seemed to be caricatures of the roles they were playing; e.g. the John Ruskin character.

The most bizarre scene in the movie involved Turner's visit to a brothel.  When he and the woman got to her private room, her ordered her to undress and lay on the bed in a certain pose.  He then proceeded to sketch her and began sobbing while continuing to sketch.  There was never a hint of a reason for this unexpected behavior.

While numerous artists work in preparation to exhibit their work, they join and discuss and do the finishing touches to their paintings. The development of this sequence and its impact is fantastic!

7030210,5,B00U7M7UPY,"Timothy Spall is marvelous as British painter JMW Turner. He grunts, groans, spits, copulates, and grumbles his way thru this film like some kind of phantasmagorical Dickensian villain. He is so unwholesome I was surprised that he wasn't flatulent as well. (Before this film, I'd only seen Spall in bits parts. Now I'm a fan. A HUGE fan.) I have no idea how accurate this depiction to the real Turner, but the character portrait is so unlikeable that for the first hour of the film I was making grand sweeping indictments of the entire British class culture. But, therein lies the FUN. Every sequence in this film is almost side-splittingly hilarious with morbid pathology. I couldn't stop laughing and smiling. Trust me. This film will not appeal to you unless you have a warped and completely off-kilter sense of humor.

There is really not much to say about the plot. It's insignificant. He loves, he hates, he paints. This is a vulgar and twisted character study about a very unpleasant, egocentric, and unusally talented painter.

The cinematography is remarkable. The artistic representations from the era are arresting. The direction is superb and the performances are just flat-out delicious. These are roles that actors live & die for. Special mention must be made to Dorothy Atkinson as Mr. Turner's lovestruck maid, Hannah Danby. She gives a riotous performance. Everytime she wandered thru a scene craning her neck I was shrieking with laughter.

Subtitles are a MUST. You won't make it thru this without them. You might also need a dictionary. You're likely to encounter words such as ""crepuscular"" and ""scrofula."" What a brilliant script.

If David Lynch, Monty Python, and Charles Dickens collaborated on a film together, this might be the result. It's absolutely bizarre and hilarious. And I loved every bleeding minute of it.

Possibly the most intrusive, inappropriate, and downright awful score to a major motion picture that I've heard in decades.  What possessed Mike Leigh to utilize it continues to baffle me, as the moment the discordant strings enter, they take you right out of the picture and whatever is happening on screen.  If I could make a copy of the film while removing the score, I'd watch it again.  The ""score"" makes Webern, Berg, and even Cage sound like Mozart.

7030223,3,B00U7M7UPY,"A very peculiar film!  People who know nothing about Mr. Turner will get very incomplete ideas about this man. Others, like me, who have worshipped his work for years will be disappointed. Before I make my point, let me say that some the acting is great, and so is the camera work, the music, etc. But Turner comes off as a mighty peculiar man (which he probably was in some respects) -- it must be said that no human being should be defined by his peculiarities alone. The whole movie supposedly covers only his last twenty years or so, but in such an incomplete manner; it is a pastiche of vignettes, as if Mike Lee (the Director) had purposefully only cherry-picked the unappetizing incidents in Turner's Life.  What happened to his voyages on the Continent and specifically Venice? To leave that out of this film is almost criminal. To define Turner as merely a painter of marine scenes is laughable. There must be more to say about a man who produced circa 20,000 pieces of the most exquisite work and  left them to the British Nation. I know of no other artist who has ever done this. Doesn't Turner deserve better? I don't want to see a romanticized Turner, but neither do I want to see only his 'warts'.

Regarding  the acting, yes, Timothy Spall deserves an Oscar for turning himself into such an ugly, miserable human being.  I also loved the portrayal of John Ruskin as the crashing bore he really was, despite his fame as the father of modern art criticism. Both the housekeeper and Mrs. Booth were ""done to a turn'. The rest of the acting wasn't particularly outstanding - I would rather call it 'competent'.

7030264,5,B00U7M7UPY,"The film explores the last quarter century of the eccentric British painter J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) who had risen from the streets to become the toast of the aristocracy.  He travels, paints, rubs elbows with the gentry, visits brothels, and is a contentious member of the Royal Academy of Arts. At one point, he has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm. In life, he was both celebrated and reviled by the British establishment. One adoring magnate offered him 100,000 pounds for his entire body of work, but Turner refused. Turners personal life was as eccentric as his artwork. He was secretly loved by his housekeeper, even though he exploited her sexually. He abandoned his first wife and then formed a bigamous relationship with a seaside landlady in Chelsea. He maintained two or three false identities.

This is a strange, haunting, and beautiful film. It lacks a plot or storyline, but the excruciatingly beautiful scenes and the impeccable acting keep you enthralled. Its like spying on the 19th century from a time machine. Every frame of the cinematography looks as if it were shot by Vermeer. The sun becomes a character in the film just as it did in Turners paintings.  Two things do fail the film, however. First, the episodes are stitched together like disjointed vignettes, and second, Gary Yershons musical soundtrack is a disaster. Despite this, Timothy Spall as Turner and Dorothy Atkinson as his housekeeper give academy award level performances. Dorothy in particular is simply mind boggling as she stands silently to the side of the action and yet steals the scene with her subtle expressions. If you like splendid acting and glorious painterly scenery, you will enjoy this movie. It is actually a work of art. As Turner says on his death bed, The sun is God!

Many of his lines were comprised of snarling grunts, but he certainly passed on a great range of feelings with those snarls and snorts.  He was a difficult character to like and I can't say that I did like him, even a little bit, yet he came across as a very layered human.  He was selfish, cold, and self absorbed.  He loved his father, but treated him like a servant.  He was a man who stuck to his principals.  He could be kind in a gruff way.  He was, above all, a genius.

I like films that encourage me to reflect on important questions, ideas and issues.

Perhaps at the time, it was not expected for the public to care about brushwork or details in pictures. Snobbish patrons who desire only what they expect and not what the artist desires show how times have changed in the art world. Although, such expectations still remain today, at times.

Perhaps this is an accurate portrayal - but it wore very thin and grating shortly into the film. A character piece is usually dialogue driven - and this main character's ""dialogue"" was 90% grunts and growls. I also found the editing very choppy - as it cut abruptly from one time/event to another - with little resolution of many details that were brought up and then abandoned. (E.G. What was up with his long-suffering maid's festering face?) Unless you are really into Turner's art - or you just love a long, drawn-out (non-verbal) character exposition - you will likely be bored.

The (digitally shot) photography is breathtakingly beautiful and the film itself is well-acted, but is pretty boring, even if you know something about the great painters life and works.

Mike Leighs Mr. Turner is not really a bio-pic in a usual sense. It only covers the last days of Turners life, and it is done in an episodic way. We see the painters hatred for another painter John Constable in the scarlet buoy scene, but we don't know why this rivalry should be so huge. The scene itself is, though a bit lengthy, intense enough to interest us thanks to the fine acting from the cast including Timothy Spall as Turner, but it after all goes nowhere, followed by another episode, giving not much insightful observation about the man or the society he lives in,

Probably this rather disjointed narrative is a natural result of director Leighs unique method of filmmaking, that is, improvisation by the actors. We are left to imagine (or research on our own) why this grumpy Mr. Turner has to travel to a seaside village, incognito, and have a sexual relationship with the landlady.

You may say this plotless realism is the style of Mike Leigh films. Maybe so, but in his previous films like Vera Drake we could meet much more interesting characters who have a story to tell.

7030305,3,B00U7M7UPY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Biographical films about painters can be problematic, and Mike Leigh's 'Mr. Turner' based on the life of the prolific British landscape artist, J.M.W. Turner, is no exception. One should first ask the question, should Leigh have actually gone ahead with the project in the first place? Couldn't this have worked better as a documentary? I had the same feelings about the recent French film, 'Renoir', which was beautifully shot, but was sorely lacking in the drama department.

Leigh begins Turner's saga as he has already reached the middle age of 50 in the 1820's. Turner's travels to lands far from England where he discovers all those marvelous landscapes which become the subject of his paintings, all ably highlighted at the beginning and throughout the rest of the film.

Leigh seeks to show the contradictions in Turner's character by damning his treatment of his ex-mistress and two daughters whom he barely acknowledges as well as his housekeeper of 40 years, Hannah Danby, whom he takes advantage of sexually. (In the sex scene between them, Danby clearly is not happy with Turner's tendency toward premature ejaculation.) In contrast, Turner apparently had a warm and loving relationship with his father, a former barber, with whom he lived with for many years, up until his death in 1829.

Later, Turner shacks up with Sophia Booth, a two-time widow, whom he ends up living with for 18 years, up until his own death in 1851. I found Booth perhaps the least interesting of Leigh's characters, despite the necessity of including her in the narrative. Indeed she has little to do except be a supportive presence to Turner; perhaps more importantly, Leigh is emphasizing that in his relationship with Booth, Turner was perfectly capable of forming a normal, caring relationship with a woman.

In one of the stronger scenes in the film, Leigh does well in showing that Turner was not always the gruff and impatient curmudgeon who often turned up in social circles. After his father's death, Turner visits a prostitute. But instead of having sex with her, has her pose clothed in bed, while he begins to draw her in his sketchbook. Suddenly tears pour down his face and he begins sobbing; clearly the the death of father has affected him greatly.

Leigh occasionally becomes so enamored with the history of the denizens of the mid-19th century English upper-class as well as the era's technological advances, that he drags out sub-plots, to the detriment of the overall narrative. Case in point: the drawn-out focus on Benjamin Haydon, a rival painter who was perennially in debt throughout his life and ultimately committed suicide. Haydon is there mainly to highlight either Turner's stinginess or financial prudence, depending on your point of view. Nonetheless, there was a little too much of the bankrupt painter for my tastes.

Another scene which seemed unnecessarily long was when Turner visits the newfangled daguerreotype shop where he has his first photo taken. (He then goes back to the same shop with Sophia so they can have a photo of the two of them taken together.) Turner remarks something to the effect that he is becoming obsolete due to rapid advances in technology. But Leigh drags scenes such as this out far longer than necessary as the awe in which these 19th century folks must have felt when they had their first picture taken, has little to do again, with advancing Turner's story.

Leigh is on more solid ground when he depicts Turner's interaction with colleagues at Royal Academy exhibits, in social conversation at home and at public venues, such as the theater. In one memorable scene, Leigh shows off his skills as 'editor' of his ensembles' often improvised dialogue, as the various artists debate their art at the Royal Academy and end up marveling at Turner's 'sleight of hand' (Turner mischievously appears to ruin his painting in front of his colleagues, by appending a red splotch in the center of one of his masterpieces, only to turn it into a buoy, bobbing in the ocean). The inane prattle of his contemporaries -- including the overly witty, noted art critic of the time, John Ruskin -- is ably highlighted. There's also a very nice scene when a theater troupe makes fun of Turner in skit and song, as Turner sits displeased in his private box.

Ultimately, Leigh doesn't quite pull off the Turner biography. This is mainly due to the fact that there is no singular or even group of antagonists that Turner is pitted against throughout the narrative. Turner's opponents, such as his mistress and two daughters, have brief cameos and are underdeveloped as foils for the 'great' artist. There is also no great conflict between Turner and his fellow artists that could lead to rising tension at the end of the second act and an exciting climax. Instead, Leigh is left to depict Turner's sad decline as he becomes more eccentric and mentally unstable, prior to his death.

If you're going to see 'Mr. Turner', see it more for the production design and the brilliant cinematography, which mimics many of Mr. Turner's grand vistas. 'Turner' has its moments, but the plot is bare-boned and overly dependent on isolated historical episodes.",1437868800,,5224,4.946408209806157

7030309,4,B00U7M7UPY,"This is a beautiful movie  not glossily beautiful in a Hollywood sense, but perfectly designed, perfectly formed and like Turners paintings it is not so much easy on the eye as having beauty which arrests the senses, alongside more prosaic reality which grounds the senses.  Even the very opening scene could be one of Turners pictures, such is the effect of the cinematography and design.
The ace in the hole here is Timothy Spall, who delivers a performance that is completely lacking in self consciousness.  He portrays a man of eccentricity  noisy, grunting, even cruel when it comes to his daughters, and as far removed from an elegant gentleman as possible, and yet at the same time a man of feelings, capable of sensitivity, and above all an artist who has a unique view on colour and on what paintings and art should actually convey.  Curmudgeonly would be kind, but his genius also shines through.  Spall isn't the only one who excels though.  There isn't a weak member of the cast, and the production design and cinematography are superb  we believe both the reality of the period down to the smallest detail, and at the same time revel in the occasional moment of profound beauty as Turner is inspired.  The language is of its time  which, while challenging on the ear (Ill admit to rewatching some scenes with subtitles) was educational and had a ring of authenticity.
All that aside, the movie seems rather too languid for its own good.  Two and a half hours seems more than I was prepared to enjoy Mr Turners company.  And though his artwork is fascinating, his life turns out to be less so.  The link between significant events in his life and the impact it had on his work are not fully explored, and the movie feels more like a mood piece than an exploration of a mans life. This story in anyone elses hands would probably have been a turn off, but with Spalls performance and the cinematography and sheer verit of the scenes, it is really worth watching.  I didn't feel enamored as the movie came to a close, but it has lingered with me, in a good and thoughtful way.  Turners work wasn't appreciated at the time, when artists were supposed to paint things the way they're supposed to be, but its impressionistic and less obvious nature exploring inner consciousness rather than outer form became more appreciated as time went on.  I feel Mike Leighs film has had precisely the same effect on me.",1437609600,,2414,4.658018867924528

7030340,3,B00U7M7UPY,"This is my first look at Mike Leigh's (""Another Year"") latest film.  It was released in the spring of 2015 in the U. S. to rave reviews, but was ignored or deplored by many theater-goers.  Put me somewhere in the middle.  In a wonderful performance, Timothy Spall (""Harry Potter"" films) plays famed British artist J. M. W. Turner.  The film covers his life from the age of 50 to his death at age 76.

Set in the early 19th century, we find Turner holed up for the most part in his studio near London.  His father, William (Paul Jesson) lives with him and helps him acquire his painting materials.  They are assisted by housekeeper Hannah Danby (Dorothy Atkinson) who allows the younger Turner a fondle when necessary and even quick sexual encounters.  She clearly has feeling for him, but he ignores her for the most part.  Turner is a bit of a cad to be sure.  He has 2 daughters from an earlier relationship with a widow.  He barely acknowledges them.

After William dies, Mr. Turner becomes depressed and even more grumpy than usual.  His vocalisms are often mumbled gibberish or a series of moans and grunts.  Revered and reviled by much of society, he is acknowledged as a great artist, especially for his portraits of sailing ships and the ocean.

He has occasion to travel to Chelsea where he spent a portion of his childhood.  He likes the setting and inspiration it brings.  There he meets a woman named Sophia Booth (Marion Bailey) and her husband (Karl Johnson).  He regularly rents a room facing the harbor and after Mr. Booth dies, takes up with the widow, adapting her name, at least while in town.

The film is filled with numerous encounters with fellow artists, common folk and royalty.  Admittedly, some of those are much fun.  I would suggest that unless you are totally literate in archaic British versions of the language of the day, you might want to engage the subtitles.  Once I did, I was inundated with phrasing and words I had never heard before (conundruous).  The deep mumbling of Turner and others comes to life.  Even conversations coming from the sidelines.  Like the story itself, it seems as authentic as the life Turner led.

The film is very long at 144 minutes and yes, it felt like it.  Much of the film moves glacially as in the walking speed of Turner in his later years.  The acting is first rate and the cinematography masterful.  The story for me was too bland but provides some insight into one of history's great artists.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and rates 1080p video resolution.  The look of the film is excellent with slightly drab colors enriched by terrific detail.  You can see the quality of the set design and the various knick-knacks sitting around the various rooms.  Excellent flesh tones including the reddish psoriasis that attacks Ms. Danby as she ages.  The black levels are excellent as well.  Audio comes in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it is excellent also.  There are many outdoor scenes including one with Turner strapped to the mast of a sailing ship to get a sense of what it's like, for a future painting.  The audio captures this nicely as it does with other scenes along the waterfront.  Interior scenes are also well represented.  Subtitles come in English (thank you), English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.  Extras include a commentary track with Mike Leigh, a short called ""The Cinematic Palette,"" another called ""The Many Colours of Mr. Turner,"" a deleted scene, a trailer and some previews.

However, as a portrait of an artist, it was painted too broadly and attempted to cover too much ground (admittedly, a major problem for any biopic dealing with an artist whose work spread over decades).  Turner's style was so innovative and revolutionary, that a movie focusing primarily on that would have served Mr. Turner better.  It also fell into the same trap as ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring"" - the movie sets/scenes were constructed to mirror the images in the paintings, so that each artist was turned into nothing more than a talented scribe, aping what was already fully formed before his eyes. Considering Mike Leigh's previous efforts (and he has quite the resume) this was a little disappointing.

7030365,3,B00U7M7UPY,"A physically beautiful movie with wonderful cinematography, solid acting and memorable performances, ""Mr. Turner"" tells the story of a famed British artist during the period of the early to mid 1800s. While not a documentary, the story is essentially biographical and meanders from event to event depicting Turner's somewhat sad and solitary life. What the film lacks is any coherent moving story line; it basically rambles from event to event with no clear connection between them. I kept waiting for the story to stitch some coherence together, but sadly, that never happens.

Timothy Spall - who is best know for playing Ron Weasley's rat - Peter Pettigrew - provides a stellar performance throughout the piece making Mr. Turner who is taciturn and abrupt, a very human character.

7030382,4,B00U7M7UPY,"""Mr. Turner""(2014) is directed by Mike Leigh (Naked). This film is about the British romantic painter J.M.W. Turner. This prolific painter, who has some 20,000 pieces of art at the Tate British in London, is portrayed in this film during the last 25 years of his life when his career was well established. The film has a droll melancholic style that is infused with a haunting score. The personalities presented often come across with the manneristic exaggerations one might find with stage actors so despite the melancholic flavour of the movie the characters often seem like humorous depictions of human misery as if out of a Dickens novel, and at times it is hard to take these depressive characters seriously since they seem so morose. This gives the film a sardonic quality that is anything but romantic. Turner seems to live a rather miserable life surrounded by unglamorous characters. There is little heroic in this depiction. This might be a turn off for many. It certainly is the opposite of a film like ""Surviving Picasso"" which is a film filled with so much robust life. Turner is shown plugging along sketching continuously like a little train that can't stop. There are, however, many scenes of beauty in the landscapes around him, which contrast with the depiction of his arduous, and collapsing life. Turner is played by Timothy Spall who took art training for two years so that he could realistically depict an artist. His decidedly unromantic depiction of Turner may turn some people's stomaches as we see him spitting on canvasses, or groping and humping his maid with his overweight body with animalistic urges that show little care or tenderness for others, or wheezing from one moment to the next from poor health. This portrayal of the artist's late life is probably not one that we may have expected or wished to have seen on the screen. Never the less, this movie is interesting since it gives us a glimpse, however fabricated, into the life and motivations of one of the great artists in history. Also the care for details such as in the recreation of the salon with its 250 or so paintings is marvellous to see, as are the multitude of scenes where the director tried to recreate images that inspired Turner.

This blu-ray has many special features, including commentary by Mike Leigh, deleted scenes, and two documentaries about the making of the film with interviews with the director, actors, production designers, and cinematographer.",1435881600,,2465,4.925480769230769

Making a film about Turner's life was not necessary, but showcasing his art is.  J M W Turner's art reached beyond the canvas and touched our inner spirit.  His painting called ""The Slave Ship"" was painted in 1840 when slavery was still raging in England and his painting brought light to the savagery of owning another human being even when it was unpopular to do so.  In a sense this is what the film is about... how artists help shape history with their art.  What motivates one individual to spend over half their life painting.  The incipient need to create is very strong with artistswhether it's telling a story with sound, literature, or just brilliantly colorful paint.

History books tell us that John Ruskin, for example, was nothing like the lisping fop that he appears in this film, so how accurate is Leigh's interpretation of Mr Turner himself? It 's good to look at, but the digitally manipulated color filters that take over many scenes are often distracting. I imagine they're meant to suggest Turner's great paintings, or the way he views the world - but why is everything suddenly green? It took a long time to involve me  mainly because I couldn't understand some of the dialogue, but I'm glad I stayed with it.

one occasion. Breathtaking shots you wished could freeze so you could fully take in every piece of the image. There was an exaggeration to each
of the characters that wasn't necessary, as though it were a rehearsal of sorts that would be tamed later. This is the fault of the director. Timothy
Spall is one of those actors that rarely misses a note - if ever, and his continued grunting throughout the entire film didn't feel authentic, but more

Right? I also didn't understand why there was no mention of his marriage to Jane Fonda or the fact that he was pretty good in some sailing competitions he entered. Instead, we are given a dull portrait of some sort of painter who tarted himself up in the sort of frilly gear that would embarrass Prince.

Best scene: Martin Savage as Benjamin Haydon when he tried to repay his loan with a 10  note. All in all, a terribly long and disappointing movie.

as a watercolor painter myself, i delved rather deeply into turner's life and works, and attest that the selection of episodes and anecdotes that the film has chosen to represent the man is both clever, humorous and (in the best sense) sentimental. viewers today may find odd the art culture of the era -- the chockablock manner of hanging paintings, or the fact that turner could paint ""improvements"" into another artist's work -- but that's how they rolled in the old days. unfortunately historical background is necessary to recognize, for example, that the young woman sniffing critically at turner's paintings is the young queen victoria, or that the lisping ginger haired dilettante (john ruskin) was the major champion of turner's art (in his several volume ""Modern Painters""), or that turner innovated the business practice, free of patronage, of selling his own works in his own gallery, or that he had occasional sex with his scabby housekeeper -- and so on. dozens of details throughout the film made me smile with recognition -- ""wow, leigh even included that!""

the film's style of showing rather than telling the people and practices of another era may leave some viewers feeling a bit stranded. if your taste runs to the ""magical heroism"" of ""Taken"" or ""Fast & Furious"", you'll be bored by ""Mr. Turner."" for those willing to watch closely and let themselves be drawn into another time and another place, a fascinating experience awaits.",1433116800,2,2093,5.0813953488372094

I was warned off by my LA friends, but I just thought, Oh, that's so LA. Well, they were as right as rain: this movie isn't worth watching. The story line is somewhat compelling; however, many Englishmen are difficult to understand--especially those with Cockney accents, and this one--mostly grunting, and only from time to time actually phonetically making a cogent sound--becomes so laborious that by the end, when he's floundering about ill, the viewer is stirred to wish to kill him merely to end the damn movie!

7030524,5,B00U7M7UPY,"I liked this film. Then again, I watch nearly all biographies and enjoy them. I especially enjoy biographical films about artists. I found this film fascinating as J.M. Turner's artwork, to look at it, doesn't reveal a man obsessed with views to the degree he would go to them regularly to sketch what he would see. Who was somewhat fascinated and a bit dreadfully bothered by the advent of the  daguerreotype camera. And that his wife was an art cretin who absolutely found nothing to appreciate in either his artwork or his need and desire to express himself with the brush.

The movie reveals that J.M.Turner had a brash, exceptionally difficult crusty personality that endeared him only to his devoted father and a very sweet lady from seaside Margate who he met when going to the seaside to sketch as he would. After Mrs. Booth's husband died he became closer to her and it was that he could take off his hat and coat with her and be a relaxed version of himself. Never mind that for the relationship started out that he presented himself, incognito, and she learned to love him for himself rather than his fame as an artist.

Aside from his endearing relationship with Mrs Booth, he seemed like he didn't have a romantic bone in his body, and was more of a lummox than a feeling man.

My favorite scenes were when Turner was walking in the green pastoral valley and saw his first steam engine, chugging forward enveloped in voluminous smoke and watched it go by and out of view, smoking up the view so bad that it dimmed the green and obliterated the view. He painted that dreadful scene. As he perceived it. And I would imagine, as a political/social statement. And then submitted it for a viewing in a gallery presentation. When Queen Victoria saw it she spited it with hatred that it was the ugliest thing she'd ever seen being nothing more than a mess of yellows. With Turner off to the side stewing in his own satisfaction.

I found it interesting that Turner had an incredible opportunity to sell ALL of his painting, sketchbooks...everything...to an wealthy American for a sum that was unimaginable back then. Turner was utterly flattered and immediately turned down the offer because he had already arranged to bequeath all of his art to England after his death.

All in all, I thought Timothy Spall was amazingly convincing. He always is anyway.",1432944000,,2360,4.688405797101449

Turner painted nature, which director Mike Leigh notoriously hates (as in his film ""Nuts in May"" deriding ""eco-freaks"") so you don't see much connection between the boorish Turner here and the beautiful landscapes Leigh has to frame occasionally.  Even those are in short supply: most of the film is set inside, with various nasty, creepy goings-on.  It is a tiresome repetition of the ""great artist as egocentric crusher of philistines"" stereotype-- ""throwing a chamber pot in the face of the public,"" to paraphrase Ruskin, another great nature-lover whom Leigh makes look creepy. He should stick to things he likes, as in Topsy-Turvy--  throw some more chamber music at us-- the best part of this film.",1432857600,,843,5.043165467625899

7030547,5,B00U7M7UPY,"I love this movie and wanted to see it after hearing Timothy Spall's Fresh Air interview.  There are many great performances in the movie, and the script is terrific, I think.  I'm not sure how accurately the film portrays the painter, his relationships, and the manner of speaking at the time, but I enjoyed these aspects.  I had to turn on the subtitles in order to understand everything that was said.  The language is colorful, and I enjoyed the classical references, like ""throw myself into the arms of Morpheus"" and ""mighty Apollo moves across his heavenly tract,"" especially in the accent that was used, not an aristocratic accent.  The last part of Turner's life overlaps the early Victorian era, so you see the beginnings of industrialization and impact of inventions like the railroad and photography.  In the movie, Turner appears afraid that photography will make painters redundant.  At the same time he is fascinated by these discoveries, and his canvases anticipate impressionism.  The other characters, such as Mrs. Somerville, Ruskin, and even the young Queen Victoria, not depicted as a fan of Turner's work, add to the richness of the piece.  The relationship between Turner and his father is particularly touching.  Though gruff, Turner is shown as a humane sort, appreciated by his peers, interested in the world and who seizes every day.

If you're among the majority, where this will be a first introduction to the artist, you'll find yourself sleeping through a lot of the film and/or walking away asking yourself, ""so what?""

The inn owner, whom Turner takes up with was played by an actress who was just too old.  This may have reflected what happened in real life, however, it drew the wrong kind of attention to the relationship, detracting from the flow of the story.  Another issue - maybe I missed it, but the relationship between Turner and the mother of his children was not defined - a sentence or two of dialogue might have cleared up my confusion.

I had never heard of Turner before the movie, I'm obviously not an art historian although I love art museums and learning.  Don't expect an edge of your seat action film however I think anyone would enjoy learning about an artist who some think is the first impressionist.
  Rather than words Spall's dialogue often consists of knowing grunts but when combined with his facial expression and body language or what ever actors call it he can communicate deep understanding, insight, emotion and story telling so clearly it cuts right to the bone emotionally.  I wish I had seen it on the big screen, maybe it will come around again but see it now, I think it is going to be one of those films we keep hearing about.
  Not for kids, the sex scenes are rather I guess unforgettable, not a lot of skin but not for kids.  I love Timothy Spall  and it is about time he got the leading role and the recognition he deserves.  Hope he gets more.

7030572,5,B00U7M7UPY,"I think this is a brilliant film about the last 25 years of John Mallord William Turner's life.  But it is a fictional film that ""represents"" the truth of his life rather than trying to be a documentary biography.  As an example, one of Turner's most famous canvases is the national treasure ""The Fighting Temeraire""  And the film shows him with friends seeing the scene in real life and his friends telling him that it would be a good subject for him.  But the painting Turner created is a fictional construction - a metaphor of something - not a literal representation of the end of the Great Warship.  By then it would have been demasted because the masts were always re-used by the Admiralty and not sold to the ship breakers.  And there is more.  But it is a scene that many people can imagine and millions, like me, love.  I attended a show on this painting on my first trip to London in the 1990s and have a book just on this painting.

What I also appreciate about this film is that it asks its audience to rise to it and seek to understand what it is portraying rather than laying it out with no more than 8 bright crayola crayons.  For example, why is Turner's father shaving the hoghead they are going to have for dinner?  I guess it might be part of the preparation of the hogs head for cooking, but he is shaving it with a barber's razor and collecting the bristles.  Why?  For PAINTING BRUSHES!  And Turner's misanthropy is portrayed in a clear way but is never discussed, it is shown.  He is respected and loved by some, but returns little.  To be with Turner is to give, not receive - other than to be close to his art.  This is never more true than in his relationship to his longtime house servant.  A woman he uses for decades and abandons towards the end of his life.  The last scenes with her alone are heartbreaking.

I did appreciate seeing Turner at the Royal Academy with his contemporaries - some of them anyway  - as they do their battles for priority with each other.  Again, it can seem a bit cruel.  And it is quite fast paced - you have to pay attention!  For example, on a vast canvas, Turner compliments one of his fellows for the instep of a left foot on one part of the canvas.  His abuse of Constable was brilliant and virtuosic, but cruel. We forget how many of the greats of that pre-Victorian Era were there TOGETHER.  And we see his fall from fashion because the young Queen Victoria sneered, ignorantly, at Turner's work.

And we see Turner live long enough to see the rise of the Pre-Raphaelites and stare wordlessly at the canvases and then laugh derisively at this new movement.  Why?  We have to think about it.  In my mind, I think he is comparing these brightly colored fantasy pictures and comparing it to how much work and sacrifice his generation had put into capturing the nuances of the real sky, real light, and actual nature and distilling its essence.  An now to be replaced or pushed aside by - well, THIS?

We also get a scene, wholly fictional I think, about him visiting a Daguerreotype shop and puzzling over the camera and having a couple done.  He expresses fear that such a device could make him extinct.  In fact, the kind of art he created was never photo realistic and created art that could never be captured by a camera.

I also, loved the scene where a wealthy man comes and offers him a vast sum for his art, but Turner explains that he has bequeathed it to the nation for the public to view.  The millions of us who have seen The Turner Collection know how our lives have been blessed by this gift to us.

The acting in the film is superb.  Timothy Spall is a brilliant choice for Turner and does a masterful job as does the rest of the cast.  I wanted to single out Martin Savage as the tortured Benjamin Robert Haydon, a painter you might want to look up.  A sad life with a horrible end for such a brilliant talent.  There is so much depth to this film, that I can't cover it all.  But the scene about Gooseberries is a masterstroke.

So, if you are in the mood to think, learn, and have some clue who Turner was and is, I think it is a brilliant achievement.",1431907200,,4133,4.333767926988266
7030573,5,B00U7M7UPY,"For a long time, I didn't like Turner's paintings. Then, I watched Simon Schama's series The Power of Art on paintings that changed the world; one of those was Turner's painting of the slaves thrown overboard. I don't like that painting at all, but after that I really looked at Turner's work and came to like it very much. The word here is ""like"" not ""understand"" or ""see the significance in"" but simply LIKE. I also knew from Simon Schama that Turner was more or less just a guy. This film shows that very well; he's liked by his fellow academicians. He has a great relationship with his father .He's lovable to women. He's tender hearted and generous and gruff; he's an ordinary person. He clearly (in the film) loves to paint and has exactly the eye that would engender the paintings. I thought it was a reasonable, possibly even realistic, depiction of Turner. It is NOT a film about his art.

I am a painter and what I do not paint is what Turner was particularly good at -- atmosphere. From Turner I learned how growing up in a humid watery world (England) would create in an artist a different perception of air than would growing up in a high altitude desert as I did. I learned to look at the air, not just at the landscape... I am grateful for what Turner taught me to see. But I didn't learn that from this movie. It's not a film about painting. It's a film about ONE painter.

One scene I found particularly wonderful was the scene in which he has his picture taken. It reminded me how Victorian England shared many things with our world now -- rapidly advancing technology first and foremost.

If you don't like British accents (and this film has at least five different ones) turn on the subtitles. If you think artists are sublime creatures with rarified souls and appetites, don't watch this film. If you're hoping to learn technique, don't watch this film. It's not for everyone. After reading some of the one star reviews (most of which seemed upset that the director didn't make the movie the viewer wanted to see) I suspect this isn't most peoples film, but I liked it very much.",1431820800,,2100,4.5065616797900265

7030584,5,B00U7M7UPY,"Mike Leigh's brilliant film of the last years of W.M.J. Turner wrenches the viewer into an age where steam and sail dominate the world, where the romantic movement in literature and art caused conflict in the culture. Turner's radical, pre-impressionist paints shock the world, but the artist, played perfectly by Timothy Spall, lives a spartan, emotionally stunted life. Leigh's depiction of that vanished world astonishes and demands an immersion into a story that offers few hand-holds for those accustomed to be being spoon-fed their emotions by standard Hollywood films.  But if you go into this film hoping for an honest depiction of human experience, for an acerbic portrait of a hallowed figure, for an emotionally devastating film that doesn't sit up and beg, then Mr. Turner might be for you.

However, I do feel that Simon Schama in his account of Turner's life  ( Power of Art ) was MUCH more insightful and profound.

Mr Turner is represented here as an oaf of a human being; he grunts his way through most of the movie.
I would not care at all for this person if it weren't for his oeuvre...(which in many ways gets passed over).
Like so many other movies about painters ; there seems to  be difficulty in translating the genius of the paintings into film
(despite much scenery evocative of his work).
Even though I don't think the film was gratifying on the whole, it still held a few truly remarkable scenes.
One of these is seeing the Royal Academy in Turner's day . The rendition of the Academicians, the whole atmosphere of the place
and the seriousness to which painters sought recognition within it's confines is brought to life in glorious detail!!

The artist himself was a truly dreadful person, giving to raping his cleaning lady whenever he felt like it, ignoring his family, and setting up a second family on the side.

Unfortunately, despite its awards and its pedigree, in our opinion the film does not attain Leigh's usually high standards.  Perhaps the problem lies in its being a biography, yet Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy was also biographical, though much less stridently so.  Perhaps Turner's life required a written script rather than Leigh's usual free form dialogue.  Perhaps a genuine documentary on Turner's life would have been better, with a much greater concentration on the art works, his influences and influence.  The general sense of the film was cramped - cramped space, light and sensation.  In part this may have been because sweeping panoramas of, for example, the English coast around Margate would necessarily show much of the present day.  But a major reason, looks to have been the over concentration on Turner (scenes like his being tied to the mast in order for him to experience a storm at sea) rather than on what he saw.

7030645,3,B00U7M7UPY,"I double-checked online to see what the professional critics said about ""Mr. Turner"" after viewing this movie.  I remembered vaguely that the movie got very high marks by many reviewers, and that was intimidating.  I was bothered by the slow pace of the movie, and quite frankly, the rather plain life of the artist, and the expected eccentricities that seem to be de rigueur for any depiction of an artist by Hollywood.  Timothy Spall's constant grunting kept reminding me of Marge Simpson, or more graciously, Alexander Calder in his later years.

It was very much a beautiful story seemingly from the British genre of early 19th century, Jane Austen-style movies.  It had a very authentic look and certainly captured the mood of the time.  It was not didactic about painting but was enlightening about the social milieu of the contemporary art scene.",1431302400,,853,4.971830985915493

Timothy Spall does an excellent job of conveying Turner's irascibility; he is forever grunting and groaning and getting away with it because of his wonderful talent.  The movie is filmed in such glorious colors that each scene looks like an oil painting by a  master; visually this film is a delight.  The 19th century sets and costumes are also perfect.

 On the down side, each scene begins intriguingly but goes nowhere; there is no continuity or build-up to a dramatic end. But it is the man himself, Turner, that I found so utterly loathsome that I can't recommend the movie.  It does show many of his art works but everything is secondary to the repulsive blowhard himself.",1431129600,,932,4.935897435897436
7030659,5,B00U7M7UPY,"Someone criticized this film for its ""lack of conflict.""  Not enough action, some others said.  Boring!  This movie is none of these. The conflict is subtle and not marked by histrionics or dire acts.  There is plenty of action, just not of the physical sort that we see too often.  Mr. Turner is a superb film for anyone who is interested in art and a marvelous revelation to anyone who, like me, has revered Turner's works for years.  The fact that Turner was often boorish and crass in his dealings with others simply points out that his art was his life and anything else was simply a distraction.  Like Beethoven, his contemporary, Turner was a genius and a monomaniac whose pursuit of his art ruled his life.  In a very meaningful moment in the movie, Turner hears a Beethoven sonata played on the piano and recognizes the music as coming from a romantic much as himself.  Indeed, Turner and Beethoven introduced the world to Romanticism through their departing from the establishment and going their own ways.  This film is well-acted and a masterpiece of cinematography. So beautiful in fact, that I already want to watch it again and it was just yesterday that I saw it for the first time.

7030666,4,B00U7M7UPY,"To be honest while I love art I am sorely lacking in knowledge of great painters. So when I heard there was a movie out about painter J.M.W. Turner it wasn't a name I was familiar with. After watching the film MR. TURNER I went back to look at some of the art he created. So strange to share a last name with someone that talented and have no idea about him.

MR. TURNER tells the story of the artists in the last few decades of his life during that early 19th century. Having become a successful painter of landscapes, making it an acceptable form of art that it had previously never enjoyed, Turner went on to create something different. But that comes in the second half of the film. The first portion deals with his day to day life, the woman he sired two daughters with and then ignored and his father, a man he was as devoted to as the man was to him.

At this point in time Turner (Timothy Spall) is a respected artists among his peers. With pictures hanging in the Royal Academy of the Arts, Turner enjoys conversing with his colleagues as well as the gentry who seek out his art in return for rewards in both monetary and social circles. One segment in this section of the film display his visiting the home of a land owner who has purchased several of his painting and whose company he enjoys. Anther finds him visiting the Royal Academy and offering suggestions there to fellow artists.

As the film progresses Turner seeks inspiration by returning to a location he remembers as a boy. There he meets and befriends a couple he rents a room from, Mr. and Mrs. Booth (Karl Johnson and Marion Bailey). His friendship with them is shrouded in secrecy as he gives himself the name of Mr. Mallard. Later when Mr. Booth passes, Turner returns to the seaside resort to continue painting there. It seems that the location offers the greatest views of sunrise and sunset in the country, most of which his paintings involve at the time. As time progresses Turner and Mrs. Booth become a couple though unmarried.

The latter half of the film moves from establishing the characters and into the later days of Turners life when he began to paint quite differently from his earlier years. The literal translations of sights he saw and placed on canvas changed to his attempts to put feelings in his paintings, establishing himself as one of the early impressionist painters of the time. Ridiculed by his contemporaries for this choice he would later be hailed for his inventiveness and use of color and light.

The movie unfolds in a slow fashion and continues that way from throughout. But thats not to say this is a bad thing. There is no way to create an action film from the life of someone during this period whose greatest action involves placing brush to canvas. What it does is present the life of the painter, the good, the bad and the ugly. The screenwriting here takes us through the years of his life in a way that holds your interest until the very end. Extreme credit must also be given to Spall who brings this man to life on screen. He never portrays him as a saint but at the same time offers a man you feel compassion for throughout.

The major reason for watching this film though is the images that are captured on screen. Cinematographer Dick Pope captures the scenery that influenced Turner as if he were creating his own work of art and indeed he does. The hillsides and seascapes that he presents here come to life on screen making it a visual feast of its own. While director Mike Leigh may get credit for bringing this whole project to fruition, it is Popes visuals that will remain with the viewer long after the film ends.

The movie might not be for everyone. Its pacing and story content feel more European than American. While in English there are times that the words chosen and accents used can make turning on the subtitles a necessary evil. But if you're willing to give it a chance, if you're looking for more drama than car chases then you might just find yourself enjoying this film. I know I did.",1431043200,4,4031,4.491132332878581

It's very slow, very dull, and most of the time I couldn't understand what the actors were saying.  There's very little insight into what made Mr. Turner the artist he was, and I just didn't care about the characters at all.  I usually am a fan of Timothy Spall and the other Leigh regulars, but it seemed like they weren't given much to work with.

I suppose you could say the lead gives a convincing performance as a boorish, boring brute who happens to be a genius, but so what?  The movie doesn't give much--if any--insight into the man, his art, his career or even his time period.  I've been told it's a tone poem.

Timothy Spall gives a career defining and masterful performance (it's a shame he did not with the Oscar for this role) and slips away completely into Mr. Turner.

It almost doesn't matter if the real life Turner was as crass, eccentric, and insensitive as portrayed here.  What matters is that such a person could have occasionally moved in and out of high society if he held enough talent.  Somewhat immoral and dishonorable people like Roman Polanski and Miles Davis have nevertheless produced a lot of great works in every era.  It's time that great artists be neither mythologized nor demonized in their personal lives.  Finally, like ""Vincent & Theo"" there is a serious attempt to show unusual landscapes and sunlight in such a way that the audience appreciates how the painters chose them.",1430870400,5,804,5.0606060606060606

I am not quite through this latest film of the master film maker, however, I have found myself understanding the language and all the harumphs quite well and have found my self chuckling to myself as I find that I am finally getting it.

This is another hard movie to review. I did like this much more than I expected to and Spall did a great job. I'm sure Turner was a really neat person and obviously an amazing painter but I'm not sure his life needed to be made into a movie.

7030689,5,B00U7M7UPY,"Mr. Turner covers the final 25 years in the life of Great Britains most celebrated painter, J.M.W. Turner (Timothy Spall). The painter of nature is depicted as a dedicated artist, turbulent lover, family man, and flamboyant carouser. The film gives us a solid look at an artists life, from his in-home studio, an overheard conversation by Queen Victoria about his work, to his association with The Royal Academy of Arts. Nineteenth-century period detail is beautifully rendered by director Mike Leigh and cinematographer Dick Pope.

Spall, who has been a familiar presence in films as a supporting player, undertakes his first leading role with Mr. Turner, and he is spot-on perfect. From his physical appearance to his grunting manner of speaking to his arrogance, he embodies the temperamental artist without resorting to cliches. Because the movie balances Turners craft with his private life, the portrait is complete. We see the man not merely as a creator of masterpieces, but as a flawed individual who created beauty on canvas that he lacked in real life.

We meet Turner already established in his profession and, without much conflict or development, we follow him to the end of his life.  Aside from his prodigious artistic talent he was, at least as the movie presents him, largely ordinary and uninteresting.  This is no criticism of the man (and even less of the gifted actor who portrays him); merely one of the makers of the movie who, if they couldn't find a story to develop or a character to disclose, should have done something else.  Similarly, there is nothing in the movie that offers any insight into his particular artistic gifts.  We see beautifully photographed seascapes and then Turner's pictures of similar seascapes but we get no insight about how he, more than thousands of other artists who painted (and still paint) the sea, stood out.  Oh by the way, with no plot line, no character development and no artistic sensibility -- the move runs for an interminable two and a half hours.",1430265600,4,1063,4.682795698924731

7030694,5,B00U7M7UPY,"As I post this review of the BLURAY version of this wonderful Mike Leigh film, I see that there are already 10 reviews posted here  though the BD and DVD release date is not until next week  May 5th. (I was provided a screener by the distributor in order to post an honest review.)That is because Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film (theaters, streaming, DVD and BD0 together and listing them on ALL the format listings. Since DVDs and BDs often have Bonus Features (This one does) that are not even on the streaming version, I always suggest that potential customers sort by Newest First (there is such an option) and then also look at the format that the reviewer is discussing. With that said, Ill concentrate on the BD (with a comment on the DVD as well).

I saw the film  Mr. Turner  on a large screen during its theatrical run and loved it. The recreation of scenes from Turners paintings was made for the large screen. I was concerned it might not have the same impact on my 42-inch flat screen television at home. Now that Ive had the opportunity to watch it on my TV, I can say I shouldnt have been concerned. Many of Turners paintings were not huge (though many were!) and the quality of the BD image on my screen is high. And, I was able to hit the pause button at various points to marvel at the photography  something you cant do in a theater. Also the film is long  at just under 2  hours  so you can watch in segments.

There are significant bonus features on both the DVD and BD. Both have a commentary by writer/director Mike Leigh, one deleted scene (just a minute long and of no real importance) and an excellent 31-minute featurette titled The Many Colours of Mr. Turner in which you will learn  among many other things  that the film was not scripted in advance of production. Leigh writes as he goes and writes the dialogue during rehearsals! Youll also learn that CGI (to recreate the light and shadows of Turners paintings was rarely used. And, finally, the story is based  mostly  on fact, though the sexual relationship that Turner had with his housekeeper was fiction  added by Leigh.

The BD release adds one more bonus featurette on the Cinematography of the film. This is 16 minutes long and features comments from the cast, the producer, and costume and production designers plus the Director of Photography. Its nice, but not essential. If you have an HD TV though, yiu  ight want to go for the BD because of a higher resolution image. (After all this film is about an ARTIST!)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7030696,5,B00U7M7UPY,"The is a parable surrounding the life of English artist, Joseph Mallord William Turner, known mostly as William Turner. It is a moral fable about a deeply-flawed and supremely-brilliant man and artist, in that order. It tells us of life in late-18th to mid-19th Century England, where class and status were more important than life and death itself. William Turner was not of the upper crust, but was very crusty, indeed. A man who refused any conformity in art, as much as he rejected any station in life, not of his own choosing and making. He was at once revolutionary and profoundly inhibited, sexually, psychologically and physically. At once conceited, and greatly altruistic, he was enigmatic as his paintings, rich with colour and meaning, and yet a maelstrom of feelings, that even he could not comprehend. Scorned by some (mostly at the top echelons of society) and beloved by others (mostly middle-class patrons), he was in equal measure, derisive of false airs, rival artists and businessmen out to market his paintings. He was a sadomasochist, before the term even existed. And he was the greatest English painter of modern times, foretelling the arrival of European impressionism, abandoning in its wake Renaissance realism, which he considered devoid of meaning and lacking any natural elements, a key component of his art: The rough waves of the sea; the hot sun bearing down on a field of grain; the tempest between ship and captain. All elements of no interest whatsoever to the wealthy, who essentially wanted paintings of themselves, while Turner made paintings of the world as he saw and experienced it, and not as he might have wished it to be otherwise. In this, his artistic honesty was unassailable, as much as his marital fidelity was based on the simple principle: ""If you can get away with it, why not"" ? This led to one and one half wives, several children out of wedlock, and the ill-treatment of his first wife, who waited on him hand and foot, and the slightly better treatment of his lover, who waited on him hand and foot, but was the wiser of the two women. While his final ability to express normal emotion to his lover may be applauded, his callous and abhorrent treatment of his spouse was immoral and deplorable. Again, we have the man as artist and we have the artist as man, neither exclusive of the other. Mike Leigh has surpassed all his other films by a long mile. Each frame, itself, a Turner pastel in rich colours and English inflectional nuance, the musical score kept to a minimum, in order that each character and painting provide the necessary sound. The cinematography, editing and costume design flawless; so much so, you start yourself to speak in middle-English to your spouse. The acting all superb and perfect, but a special note about Timothy Spall. There is NO bad Timothy Spall performance, ever. I cannot even begin to describe the layers of nuance, emotion, sensitivity, pain, subsumed anger, sexual inhibition and sexual depravity, that is displayed by Mr Spall. Either he really IS William Turner or perhaps William Turner was Timothy Spall, in another life. There are outstanding performances and there are performances that will last for generations to come. Mr Spall's performance was, without question, the latter. It is simply one of the finest displays of acting in the last half-century. It is THAT good that Mr Spall deserves NO Academy Award just to entirely validate the Hollywood maxim that no brilliant performance goes rewarded. Imagine Sir Lawrence Olivier as artist, and you get a sense of what I mean. Other than Sir Michael Caine, I doubt any Englishman, removed to Hollywood, would have the slightest clue what Mr Spall has accomplished. This is a long movie, at 2.5 hours, and it is a slow movie, just as Turner was a slow artist, Mike Leigh (like Turner) daring you to sit enthralled and patient, silent with no complaint, as you watch an actor in his prime work cinematic and artistic magic before our eyes, and perhaps before the very rough seas, that informed his work. If you miss this film, you will be at a very great loss.",1429660800,80,4113,4.84375
7030697,4,B00U7M7UPY,"MR. TURNER is a visual delight; a 19th century painting brought to life.  The film, written and directed by Mike Leigh, was Oscar-nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, as well as Best Original Score, and all of those accolades were richly deserved.

Unfortunately, Timothy Spall, who brilliantly plays the title role and won top awards from the Cannes Film Festival, New York Film Critics and the National Society of Film Critics, was overlooked by the Motion Picture Academy.

The film spans the last twenty-three years of Britains most revered painter,  J.M.W. Turner,  a complex man whose relationships with his family, fellow artists and lovers were often as tumultuous as the canvases he painted.

Certainly the most compelling moments in the film come during its second half when Turner discovers that his once admired paintings are now going out of fashion.

My problem with MR. TURNER is that I was not really that familiar with the man, his work or the time in England in which he lived, so for the first half hour or so of the movie, I was somewhat lost as to what was going on.

I had the same experience the first time I saw the initial THE LORD OF THE RINGS movie.  I had never read the books, thus I was unfamiliar with the world that Tolkien had created.  That situation changed when I saw the film a second time, an extended version on DVD, which better explained the back story.

Indeed, perhaps MR. TURNER would have been more accessible had Leigh better framed his story to compensate for the fact that there are certainly many more viewers like myself who are new to Turner and the era in which he lived.

Aside from Spall, the excellent cast includes Dorothy Atkinson,  Marion Bailey,  Paul Jesson and Lesley Manville.

The Blu-ray disc from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment includes audio commentary by Leigh, a deleted scene and two Making of featurettes.

7030698,5,B00U7M7UPY,"One of the ten or twenty best movies I've ever seen.  It's like a fine novel:  repeated viewings on a big-screen in a darkened movie theater reveal just how masterfully and honestly acted, filmed, and directed this motion picture really is.  Seeing it on DVD with all the distractions and screen limitations inherent in home-viewing may interfere with the film's absorbing quality.  Director Leigh and his actors (Spall et al.) have given interviews (available on-line) that show how much thought and preparation went into this movie.  The cast is superb through and through  This will be one that is remembered in years to come.  The cinematography does honor to its subject and to the locales he sought out.  A worthy successor to ""Topsy-Turvy"" -- with all of its own keen insights into the quirkiness and perhaps the element of randomness entailed in creative (and in that case of Gilbert & Sullivan, also performing) art.
Four scenes in particular are visually striking (once again, Dick Pope was Leigh's cinematographer):  (1) Turner trudges uphill against the sky as a line of a half dozen horses enter the frame from the lower left -- and then the viewer is shown a view of the sky and sea from the crest, only to have the camera pitch downward to reveal the steep slope down to the beach with the small figure of Turner sketching:  the inversion of sea over land and the interpenetration of sea and land recall Proust's Narrator's description of Elstir's seascape in which land and sea interpenetrate -- Proust was a great admirer of Turner; (2) Turner and others in a rowing craft see the HMS Temeraire of Trafalgar fame being towed by a steam vessel to a wrecking yard -- the fortuitous capture of fading light is, well, ""Sublime"" (to use an aesthetic term Turner would have recognized) -- it is the film's only resort to digital imagery (the vessels on the horizon) is tastefully done; (3) the vernissage (varnishing day) scene where Turner, to the uncomprehending shock of others gathered in the gallery, seems to deface one of his marine paintings, only to give it the sharp focus it had lacked; (4) not a single scene so much as several scenes showing the gradual accumulation of tenderness and emotion between Turner and Mrs. Booth (a building of emotion that is realized with consummate restraint by Spall and that subtle marvel Marion Bailey).  It would be interesting to hear more from the director and actors on the theme of Turner's complex but undemonstrative relations with women:  for example, Hannah Danby, Mrs. Booth, Mrs. Somerville, Miss Coggins (the pianist), his daughters and their mother -- and the uncast role of Turner's mother who died in a Bedlam but who pervades the emotions of the film.",1428969600,7,2724,4.8469827586206895
8704618,2,B00U7M7UPY,"Visually stunning, and the Academy part is the best. Otherwise a crazy quilt of episodes, under powered by scenes of rape and sexual molestation. Horrible to watch, wit the end result being a profound dislike for Turner and his art. But are these sexual encounters true?  Who can say. They should have been left out entirely.",1532390400,,325,4.803571428571429

8704621,5,B00U7M7UPY,Timothy Spall is  amazing as William H. Turner.  I purchased this film after watching  a BBC special on the making of Mr. Turner. Spall spent 2 years  learning to paint in the style of  Turner to prepare for the role and his paintings are used in the film. The  research that went into this film is amazing as well.  The cinematography is spectacular.  Even the music in this film sighs the loniness of Mr. Turner .

I had hoped to gain a little knowledge about the painters creative process and techniques but instead found a movie chronicling the daily dalliances of an aging curmudgeon.  Perhaps a movie about his middle 25 years would have been more interesting than the last 25.  2 stars is for the scenery.
