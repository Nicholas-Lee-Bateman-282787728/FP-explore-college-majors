8118290,2,B000F6ZCHA,Great information- except when they describe the brothels and show numerous pictures and statues with huge penises.  The penis part of the movie made it impossible to show in school.,1416614400,3,182,5.066666666666666
8118291,5,B000F6ZCHA,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,2,367,4.447761194029851
8118292,4,B000F6ZCHA,"As expected, the dramatic documentary was a great preparation for our visit to Pompey.  Historically accurate and using shots really from the archaelogical site it gives a visual historic record.  The director created stories around the plaster casts of bodies trapped in the eruption.  Great for kids (but caution some of the shots with skeletal remains scared our 4 year old daughter)",1194220800,13,386,5.193548387096774
