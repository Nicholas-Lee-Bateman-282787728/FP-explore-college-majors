8213346,5,B000UI6ZGK,"I purchased this VHS version of volume 1 to replace an aged over-used copy. This is GREAT material I have used for years. It is a little dated now (clothes, etc), but still GREAT. I would suggest the DVD version, you can sometimes find it on Amazon for about $100 ($125+Shipping from CareerTrack). The research, goals, and strategies  of Rick & Rick are timeless and very practical.",1417478400,,382,4.701492537313433
