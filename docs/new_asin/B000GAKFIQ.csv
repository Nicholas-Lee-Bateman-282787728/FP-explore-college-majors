2603790,5,B000GAKFIQ,"I originally borrowed a copy of Source Power to try it out. I've done martial arts since I was a child and yoga for about nine years, the idea of a fusion of both is fascinating to a fanatic of both disciplines like me. I had tried Budokon with good results but it is simply a good yoga session followed by a basic karate session. (Budokon is highly recommended but hardly the fusion it promises to be).

Source Power is the most advanced yoga DVD I've ever done. As preface I'll say that the very first time I tried it I had just (literally) gone through a painful break-up and needed to get ""my body moving"" lest I fell into a sad stupor. By the time I finished I felt better than I had all day. I jumped into the full workout without having first watched it (something I recommend people do). The video is shot in black and white and is aesthetically pleasing. Intermingled with the workout are a series of close-up footage shot in 9mm (not something I've ever seen in a yoga video) to better show the poses. The work-out is also shot in a diagonal angle to the viewer, which if different, it's also a little frustrating when trying to figure out some of the moves that are first done opposite the viewer. After the first couple of sections (Energy, wrist stretches, etc.) I felt good and thought I was on easy street. Then the real fun began!

The following sessions included a series of hip-openers, kicking and handstands woven into a challenging series of sun salutations. Wong keeps a certain amount tension in his body, reminiscent of some Chinese martial arts, something I am not used to and don't really like but time will tell if there is something to be learned from that. One does not perform this workout to learn how to fight, but the influence of martial arts is well developed; one does not feel the gears grinding from going from yoga to kicking/punching, they are part of a workout that flows extremely well, very seamless. Wong performs them flawlessly and his mastery is something worth shooting for. I felt ""fight ready"" when I finished.

I expected the session to last the usual 45 minutes (like every other ""long"" yoga video/DVD I own) but this thing went for almost two hours! There are however, two other shorter workouts to choose from which are basically the long workout broken into particular segments. Wong finds a way to take the more generic salutations a step further and make them more challenging than anything I've done outside a class. He keeps this in mind and often reminds the viewer ""Something to work towards"" or ""This is intense""... Yeah, no kidding, Duncan!

There are several poses, such as handstands that I never thought I'd see on a DVD. Most inspiring is that Wong directs you in such a way that with practice (albeit a lot of practice) one can achieve the same mastery; this DVD gets you moving along toward that goal.

Like most things well done, there are several layers to Source Power. The workout is decisively physical while the mudras help you (supposedly) to connect to more subtle energies. I don't buy that stuff as much as I used to as a teenager but knowing what the mudras mean and putting one's intention on the attribute they represent helps the mind strive for it. There's nothing metaphysical about that, it's just how the mind works.

The end of the workout is a little halting. Wong leads the viewer to a small meditation (twice) and then goes on to a Crow pose and some other poses, before finally ending with Shabasana (sp). I thought this was a little askew; going from one extraneous workout to meditation to a few more poses (which at that point don't add to much) seems a bit unfocused. Then again, the fact that so much care went into this video makes me think there might be something to that strange sequence and I'll be sure to edit these comments when I've had a chance to become more familiar with the workout.

Power Source gets big points for conceptual originality in presentation and in the workout. This is not the cookie-cutter Yoga DVD/video Gaiam kept putting out years ago (although I still recommend those, in spite of some outrageous flaws). Wong is pushing the paradigm here and hopefully others will take notice.

The only thing I can think of that could have improved the DVD is the camera work. The angle works for me but a second camera shooting from the opposite angle would help better understand some of the poses. Also, the cover mentions, ""massage"" as one of the ingredients in the fusion, but it only appears once in the entire workout. A fact I'm willing to overlook since I didn't like it.

For my money, Power Source is the best and most advanced yoga DVD I've ever done. Kudos to Acacia for putting out this series, which along with Shiva Rea's, are the most original, well thought-out workout DVDs in the market right now.

---Update 6/28/08---

I'm updating this review as I said I would after working with the DVD some more. I have to admit the session felt better before; my personal style is trying to achieve full relaxation while performing poses and Wong's approach seems to use too much tension for my taste. It should be said one does not have to follow all his movements to the ""T"" but at least I like to be ""in sync"" while I'm being taught something.

The ending (meditation/Crow pose/meditation again) did not feel right to me then and nor does it now. It is disjointed from the rest of the video and Wong seems to be following his own personal preferences rather than something people watching would benefit from. I personally don't.

For fairness' sake, the tally for this review says 20 people have found it helpful. If ""not helpful"" votes appear they're likely from people who don't agree with the update. : )",1178928000,49,5735,4.583414634146341
2603791,5,B000GAKFIQ,"Just like his first in production, beautiful quality & content, the workout feel, pace, etc. is the same, just goes a little harder then the first. Just like his first, this is foremost stretching, body awareness, yoga & some martial art poses.
The entire DVD is played in B&W in a beautiful studio w/Eastern sculptures & art. Duncan is on a simple hardwood floor with a natural mat & narrating the movements with simple, beautiful Eastern fused music. It has an artsy feel, beautiful use of lighting, very beautiful. The menu selections are: Full Workout, Source Flow Workout, Source Force Workout, Chapter Index, Bonus Fatures, Audio Setup (w/ or w/o narration).

FULL WORKOUT:
Intro, Prana Prep, Energy Practice, Wrist Therapy, (Gluteal Ground Work missing here), Shoulder Session, Warrior Salute, Kicking Sequence, Standing Set, Hip Openers, Core Floor Flow, Back Bends & Finishing Poses, Savasana/meditation, Credits.

Source Force: Energy Practice, Warrior Salute, Standing Set, Back Bends & Finishing Poses, Savasana.

BONUS FEATURES:

Adjustments: Same studio, him helping a woman into poses such as downward scorpion, cobra roll prep, standing cobra roll, swan pose, double pigeon pose & giving additional detailed instruction.

Beautiful pictures seperating each portion, he is great w/body awareness, knowing muscles to stretch & best way before moving on. There are many stretches I've never seen before that felt great.
This second DVD is much more physically demanding then the first in terms of both flexibility & physical strength (a lot of crow/holding body up with just hands, some handstands, etc.) This is best for people who are at pretty flexible or very, at least a beg/itnermediate or better yoga practitioner & almost no or no joint limitations. Other then muscle tiredness, I had no trouble keeping up or doing the positions or exercises (skipped over any handstands though & only doing 2-3 portions at a time).

I felt much more energized, calm, centered & grounded whenever doing even part of this workout.

You can get idea of this DVD with very beautiful video clips on his site at yogicarts for wrist therapy, warrior series building, etc. that look similar, but not exactly to this dvd.",1175385600,19,2706,5.25
2603792,5,B000GAKFIQ,This is the next step from power yoga.  If you're fairly athletic and enjoy Ashtanga yoga you'll really appreciate Wong's form.,1174608000,9,127,5.0476190476190474

2603804,5,B000GAKFIQ,"precise instructions from a great Master, very empowering flow, intense practice, beautiful and skillful combination of martial arts, yoga and therapy.
 I started yoga 2 years ago and have only been following Duncan Wong in my practice so far, and in just 2 years such a progress, both on the physical level and spiritual.
When I first saw this dvd 2 years ago and tried to follow I couldn't do it at all... And was crying because I thought I was hopeless :) Now I'm doing handstands, padmasana and many other. Mastering the movement is helping me to master the mind. Always believe in yourself! You can do everything :)",1388707200,,620,4.636363636363637

2603806,5,B000GAKFIQ,"My sweet friend in Maui took a workshop from Duncan and highly recommended him. I bought all his DVD's and they've changed my life. Wow. His healing techniques are so unique, detoxing, challenging and perfect in every way. Finally I can incorporate Tai Chi and Yoga. Rad. Thank you, Duncan!",1371600000,,290,4.82
2603807,5,B000GAKFIQ,I am a yoga instructor and Duncan Wong is a energetic yogi.  This is intense and separated into sections so you do not have to do the whole workout.  You can zero in on abs or upper body etc.  He has some moves I haven't seen before and it always helps to bring fresh ideas to my class.,1367971200,,286,3.896551724137931
2603808,5,B000GAKFIQ,"I purchased this DVD after taking a class lead by Duncan Wong at the Telluride Yoga Festival in July 2012.  In person, his style is fun and playful, yet can be quite challenging.  Also Duncan clearly has a depth of understanding the dynamics of asana, the body and breath and clearly articulates during class as well as throughout his DVD's.  This DVD is well worth the money for the seasoned yogi or yogini looking to shake up the Flow and take your home practice to a new level.  Featured in the video the beautiful, wood laden room provides a warm, simple, setting, with a number of sizable, well placed Hindu statues in the background.  The dramatic black & white, smokey, cinematography is a pleasure to watch over and over again.  His voice is smooth and steady with just enough instruction.  Multiple camera angles provide a clear visual in addition to the vocal instruction.  His mastery of asana provides inspiration as he effortlessly pops into handstands, arm balances and what not, throughout, landing as light as a feather into the next asana.  The DVD options include participation in a full 100 minute workout, or choose to take the break down into two 50 minute workouts or segment selection of certain body parts (shoulders, hips...etc.) depending on physical needs and/or allotted time.

The full workout starts with intelligent breath work, slowly building heat in the body, working in segments and moving into a dynamic practice including many different variations with arms/legs etc. with ""no rest for the wicked"", as he moves at a steady pace from move to move.  Special features include - audio options with instruction with music or music only.  A Gung Fu demonstration, 12 of Duncan's favorite mudras, with a 12-page booklet of program notes and photos of mudras.  For teachers, such as myself, adjustments of various poses is included too.  The fusion of Yoga and Martial Arts makes for a yummy blend.  This has become my new favorite, go-to video for home practice!  My students have enjoyed learning and benefiting from this practice too!",1353369600,,2066,4.927745664739884
2603809,2,B000GAKFIQ,"I've been practicing traditional Ashtanga yoga for 14 years.  I saw a clip of this video and thought it was beautiful, pleasant, and well-done.  I downloaded it and was sorely disappointed.  If you're a traditional Ashtanga practitioner, this is not the video for you.  If you're new to yoga, or do Bikram or other variations, this is probably a good video to buy.  I think Duncan Wong is talented and gifted.  Yet he does not practice traditional yoga, in its purest sense.  i don't know that he even claims to.  This is his variation and projection of yoga and he is entitled to that.  If he were to make a traditional yoga DVD done just like this one, I would buy it in a heartbeat.",1337990400,,685,4.416
2603810,5,B000GAKFIQ,"This is the best yoga video I've ever practiced to. I love the breathing/energy/bandha exercises to clear the mind and prepare for the flow.  It moves into wrist strengthening and shoulder opening to prepare for the more challenging poses. When I'm done I feel like I got a great workout, but I'm also centered and stretched and flexible.  I've never felt so good after a yoga routine!",1327276800,,385,4.731343283582089
2603811,4,B000GAKFIQ,"a very good DVD workout, event though I'm a bit disapointed in the lack of arm balances. the only arm balance included is crowpose and handstand, even though the introduction and view of duncan beforeyou choose pour program shows more advanced balances...",1289088000,,255,5.095238095238095
2603812,4,B000GAKFIQ,"Its good, wish Duncan Wong would slow down a little bit, His moves are fast it doesn't feel like he's in the room with you,(like P90x and Insanity)but overall pretty good.",1284768000,,171,4.548387096774194
2603823,5,B000GAKFIQ,"I consider myself and intermediate yoga student, I have been practicing a few years and am at the tail end of a year long yoga teacher certification program.  This DVD is both challenging and inspirational to me.  The workout is long (1 hour 40 min) - but can be broken into two 50 min sessions (power or flow).  I am not yet able to do all of the moves - however I am always able to do a variation of the pose that is correct.  I believe this DVD is gear toward the student who either has some previous yoga knowledge OR is willing to do a little research into correct alignment (I reccommend an Iyengar book or Sivananda Companion).

Over all I think it's a powerfully physical advanced DVD, the cues and encouragement ""This is something to work towards"" ""That's it!"" make me feel although I'm not there yet that I will be if I stick with it.  In addition it's beautifully shot, the background music is not distracting.

I recommend this to any beginner as an inspirational video (to watch!) to any intermediates as a practice, and I guess I can't speak to the advanced yet!  Love the practice 10/10!",1275436800,,1102,4.420792079207921
2603824,2,B000GAKFIQ,"This is just too complicated for me. It must be designed for people who have been practicing and exploring yoga regularly for more than 2 years. And when I say regularly, I mean 3-6 times a week. I also didn't like the atmosphere I found it very dark and not motivating. I didn't enjoy it. Even if I would progress, it would probably not become one of my favorite. This is probably due to a lack of affinity with the yoga master. Sorry.",1275350400,2,436,4.265060240963855
2603825,1,B000GAKFIQ,"Duncan Wong is obviously a very skillful yoga practitioner, and this DVD shows it -- but that's pretty much all you get: a pretty show of Wong's abilities. If you're a beginner, forget it. There's no instruction for any of the moves, he just jumps right in and goes -- and he goes fast. You have no idea if you're doing anything right: are my feet right? Am I breathing right? Is my torso right? Nothing. I thought I would just follow along, but I had zero confidence I was doing anything correctly, so whats the point? I don't know what Wong had in mind when creating this DVD, but its certainly NOT an instructional DVD. Don't waste your time.",1272326400,7,645,4.383333333333334
