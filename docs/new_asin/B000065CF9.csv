1707171,4,B000065CF9,Bought this for gift for my mom so she can have a few laughs and she has really enjoyed the DVD! She did comment that she would like to hear more music on it but enjoyed the comedy as well.,1389052800,,189,3.75
1707172,5,B000065CF9,"Perfect for ""G"" rated hilarious humor that won't offend anyone.  These are the type of video cds I collect - brilliant entertainers who are no longer with us.  I highly recommend this video series.",1388620800,2,197,4.764705882352941
1707173,3,B000065CF9,Victor Borge is a great piano player. The Act was not great as it is a collection of Shows which changed scene. The Feature button does not work on the beginning of DVD.. I would next time buy a complete show. I am very happy with the Seller.they preform outstanding shipping to me...,1388361600,,284,4.377358490566038
1707174,5,B000065CF9,It was a gift and the receipent was delighted with the DVD! I know that the person liked it because they smiled,1387152000,,111,4.090909090909091
1707175,5,B000065CF9,Feel good after viewing this DVD.  They broke the mold when Victor Borge was born.  His misinformation (and information) about musicians and music is hilarious.,1380931200,,160,5.36
1707176,1,B000065CF9,Unfortunately this dvd isn't.  You can better performances via youtube.  And it's free!  Save your money.  Don't buy this dvd.,1365120000,,126,5.15
1707177,5,B000065CF9,"very funny, I purchased the classic collection and this was included in that collection, so extra DVD, this sucks I have to write more crap......",1359417600,,145,4.84
1707178,4,B000065CF9,"I remember watching him on the Ed Sullivan show, and thought he was really wonderful. I was hoping to find good representation of his great talent. This DVD has only his most popular comedic bits, and while I like it, it was still not quite what I was hoping for. I would recommend this to anyone who has never heard him.",1356912000,2,321,4.278688524590164
1707179,5,B000065CF9,This  was for my husband who has spent hours laughing with Victor Borge. His style is unique yet still enjoyable.,1339372800,,113,4.65
1707180,5,B000065CF9,Too many laughs to count. This has been fun for the whole family. He is a master of old school slapstick and is also a brilliant piano player.,1322870400,,142,4.107142857142857
1707181,4,B000065CF9,"The Victor Borge DVDs are as entertaining as expected. The quality of picture sometimes reflects the era in which they were filmed, but this tends to add to the ambience. For one buying sets of Borge , it pays to check the contents carefully as there is an overlap in content.",1316736000,2,276,4.431372549019608
1707182,4,B000065CF9,"It's kind of a low budget production, and many of the clips are very old, even black and white.  But if you're a fan of Victor Borge or like the older-style comedy, it's pretty entertaining.",1265414400,,190,4.428571428571429
1707183,1,B000065CF9,I was disappointed.  I remember Victor Borge on television as being very funny.  This video didn't show him the way I remembered. I won't order any more Victor Borge videos.,1235260800,3,173,4.733333333333333
1707184,5,B000065CF9,"Oh, Dear Victor! All I have to do is play your music and watch your mastery of the comic art,,,,,,and voila! I smile with contentment and giggle with abandon.",1231632000,2,158,4.482758620689655
1707185,5,B000065CF9,My kids and my wife and I just adore this DVD.  They really love the autumn leaves routine.  It's great fun.,1215129600,,108,4.095238095238095
1707186,4,B000065CF9,"Bad picture, funny man... just turn of the screen and listen, its almost better that way.",1214438400,,89,4.625
1707187,5,B000065CF9,The video was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.  I used Mr. Borge's Phonetically Speaking segment to help reinforce punctuation usage with my students.  I thought it was fairly effective with them.,1198281600,,210,5.53125
1707188,5,B000065CF9,"Victor Borge was a genius. This DVD shows why he was so popular, so loved and so admired. Funny, funny and clever.",1192752000,,114,4.2272727272727275
1707189,3,B000065CF9,"OK, Victor is definitly on of the funniest performers ever.
Nevertheless, after seeing through this one, I really miss the most funny clip ever, namely the Singing-Punctuation part with Dean Martin on Deans show. No collections are complete without that one, but luckily you can check it out on YouTube.",1188950400,12,303,5.08
1707195,5,B000065CF9,"I have watched Victor Borge on PBS for several years and am looking forward to this DVD I just ordered. I have no doubt it will be great. Like the other reviewers, I agree this is great humor appropriate even for children. I don't have to worry about vulgarity which is so common among the so called great comedians these days!",1175040000,2,327,4.377049180327869
1707196,5,B000065CF9,"Anyone who doesn't know Victor Borge is just too young and missing out on the best entertainer ever.  This is a showcase of Victor's best funny moments, all of which I never get tired of watching!  However, Victor was also a very accomplished pianist and serious entertainer - if you get this (and you definitely should), make sure you get additional DVD's that show Victor's other serious talents.",1173398400,8,398,4.838235294117647
1707197,5,B000065CF9,"Both a brilliant pianist and an exceptional comedian, Victor Borge is scintillatingly, if not outrageously, funny in several of his most famous skits.  Well worth the cost, and worth the time to watch, if you like clean humor.",1173312000,,226,4.947368421052632
1707198,3,B000065CF9,"There is another version out there, maybe the 2000 edition (not sure if this was the 1996 edition?) that was much much better. This DVD was dissapointing and the best part was at the end of the DVD where they just jumped into the middle of his performance and only showed about 2 minutes of it. I do not recommend this version.",1170547200,22,327,4.290322580645161
1707199,5,B000065CF9,"I enjoyed Victor Borge in person, many years ago.  This DVD brings back many funny memories.

Hope to expose the grandkids to this great musician.",1169769600,3,146,4.8
1707200,5,B000065CF9,"My family enjoyed the performances by Mr Borge very much. He is humorous, witty and a musical genius. Good, clean wholesome fun.",1168819200,,128,4.863636363636363
1707201,5,B000065CF9,"If you love pure comedy, you'll love this video.  He was not only an accomplished pianist but a brilliant commedian.  These snippets of his funniest moments will make you want to watch this video all over again.",1168300800,3,211,4.675675675675675
1707202,5,B000065CF9,"Great entertainment, (pht) by a great artist. Well worth watching, but make sure you are sitting down or you might fall over laughing.",1156982400,7,134,4.869565217391305
1707203,5,B000065CF9,"Victor Borge was possibly the funniest stand-up (with the occassional sit-down) comedian of all times...he combined superlative piano-playing, with even more superlative humour, with a sense of timing & panache that most comedians would give their sense of humour for.

This DVD has some classic episodes (with the Muppets, an old, but rib-tickling episode as Liszt, and of course, his classic Phonetic Punctuation, An Opera by Mozart & the pianoforte duet played with a Turkish Pianist).

All parents should vaccinate their children with a regular dose of Borge, to demonstrate how humour can be outstanding without the use of excessive vulgarity or tastelessness (which seems to be the rule today).

Bravo, Mr. Borge, may your humour never die !!!!",1121644800,98,750,5.285714285714286
1707204,3,B000065CF9,"Very good, even if in ""The Timid Page Turner"" the scene with the ""William Tell Overture"" it has been broken away from this publication.",1101772800,8,135,4.666666666666667
7960886,1,B000065CF9,"Do not make the mistake of buying this version.  I have not had the chance to see other versions, but none of them could possibly be as bad as this slipshod compilation hastily thrown together without any context or theme.  One example:  an excerpt of his famous and brilliant phonetic punctuation act is presented without including the traditional introduction in which he explains how it works (which is equally funny), leaving any first-time viewer with no appreciation for the cleverness of the bit.  Very, very, very disappointing.",1505347200,,536,5.126436781609195
7960887,5,B000065CF9,"I got this for my adult son who had had some little exposure to Victor Borge.  He was laughing so hard by the end that he had tears rolling down his cheeks.  We loved the whole thing, but like many others, would have liked the whole clip each time.  The silly language interpretations were the BEST.",1478649600,,299,4.303571428571429

7960889,5,B000065CF9,great deal,1470614400,,10,4.5
7960890,3,B000065CF9,"Victor Borge is a great musician who is different from most  famous musicians. He will give you an enlightening view of music.  However, as this is a collection of his memorable performances, I would advise you to try other DVDs of Borge. This DVD is a history.  T.K.OHSKA",1468108800,,272,4.625
7960891,5,B000065CF9,Liked him since the seventies! Always great clean way to have fun together with the family!,1467936000,,91,4.75
7960892,5,B000065CF9,"This was a gift for my husband.  We had a VCR version of this and am very glad we were able to get a DVD copy.
Love Victor Borge. Very funny, very refreshing.",1458432000,,158,3.787878787878788
7960893,5,B000065CF9,My VHS wound up damaged and I found this DVD replacement. I'm a long-time Borge fan since seeing him on TV as a child. All these years later I still find his talent amazing and love watching him over and over again.,1447718400,,215,4.142857142857143

7960895,5,B000065CF9,This guy is one very funny pianist!  I laugh over and over again when viewing this or his other DVD's.  He had a real talent for facial expressions combined with his music abilities.  I would recommend this to anyone of any age.,1445385600,,228,4.380952380952381
