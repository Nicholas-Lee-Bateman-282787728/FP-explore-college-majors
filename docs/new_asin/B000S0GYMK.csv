2878553,5,B000S0GYMK,"This is a great addition for any paranormal collection. I especially enjoyed the ""The Haunted History of Halloween"" and "" Salem Witch Trials"" from the History Channel. If you like to know the history end these 2 are for you. From Vampires to Hauntings this collection has it all. I give it an A++.",1211241600,28,297,4.518518518518518
2878554,5,B000S0GYMK,"I love when the History Channel begins airing its stable of paranormal shows heavily around Halloween. This is a great bargain for five DVDs. ""Vampire Secrets"" is the excellent 2-hour program from 2006 (100 minutes), while the other four are hour long shows (50 minutes). This is worth it just for ""Vampire Secrets"" and ""The Haunted History of Halloween."" Either one of these two DVDs purchased separately cost as much as this entire set. The others in this series are quite good too...they include slightly older shows from the mid 90's about poltergeists, hauntings, etc. Some of which I don't remember seeing before. For the price, it is well worth it!",1207785600,64,655,4.90990990990991
2878555,5,B000S0GYMK,"I purchased this DVD set for a friend of mine who is into the hauntings, vampires, etc. She thought it was the neatest gift that anyone has ever given her!

2878569,4,B000S0GYMK,I like the ones I have watched so far but I haven't seen all of them.  I'm not really interested in Vampires so I haven't seen that one.  The others are interesting and informative.,1389398400,2,181,4.294117647058823
2878570,4,B000S0GYMK,A great addition to a halloween library. I had to grab this when I saw it was available to buy. I had seen part of the series on tv so to own it now I can watch it when I have the time.,1386028800,,185,3.3255813953488373
2878571,5,B000S0GYMK,"Enjoyable collection of videos from the History Channel.  The collection was less expensive than buying each video separately.  My young teens enjoyed these as they were informative and condensed into hour-long programs.  While they aren't extremely in-depth, they cover the basics of each topic well.",1383350400,2,301,5.644444444444445
2878572,3,B000S0GYMK,It's a decent DVD set but wish they would've put more then 1 movie per DVD since shows are only 45 mins or so long. Kind of annoying to have to changed DVDs so many times,1382832000,,170,3.75
2878573,3,B000S0GYMK,"This was a pretty good series. A Haunting is even better though, as is Unsolved Mysteries, so if it comes down to it, grab those series' instead.",1377302400,3,145,4.407407407407407
2878574,5,B000S0GYMK,"Each disc features an hour long (tv hour, anyway) episode on this topic, as seen on History channel. I am very pleased.",1376697600,,119,4.454545454545454

2878578,2,B000S0GYMK,"Half of the DVD's are decent: Halloween, vampires and especially Salem.
The other stuff is not worth seeing - buy the DVD's separately, if you have to.",1366070400,,151,4.62962962962963
2878579,5,B000S0GYMK,I loved all these video's. They are great for getting into the Fall season and understanding the history behind it,1353888000,,114,4.75
2878580,5,B000S0GYMK,These are some fun videos I got for Halloween.  The history of Halloween is a fun one to watch.  The witch trials DVD was really interesting.  I was able to visit Salem in my 20's and the video was a good reminder of all I saw and experienced.,1353283200,,243,4.020833333333333
2878581,4,B000S0GYMK,"Though these are all TV episodes that aired separately, they make for a nice collection to watch every fall. Well, any time really, though it seems apropos to view them around the Halloween season. Poltergeist is probably the weakest installment in terms of wanting to watch over and over. The rest are very good, and you just might learn something you hadn't heard before. There is nothing particularly scary in any of the videos, maybe a little gross; Countess Bathory, for instance, in the vampire episode. If you want a little more than the Great Pumpkin but a little less than slasher movies, you might be happy to own this box set.",1346976000,,637,4.696428571428571
2878582,4,B000S0GYMK,"I liked this collection, a little shorter runtime than I expected but the documentaries were good. If you like stuff like this I would highly recommend ""a haunting"" season 1-4, you can buy it here on amazon.",1337644800,,207,4.621621621621622
2878583,5,B000S0GYMK,"Somehow my review of ""A Haunting"" seasons 1-4 got mixed up with this review of Haunted Histories.  I have just edited it becuase I was raving about ""A Haunting"", not Haunted Histories.  I have never seen that.",1333929600,,209,4.621621621621622
2878584,5,B000S0GYMK,I found this series to be very intriguing. I was not aware that Halloween as we know it is a blended tradtional holiday. Very informative.,1330732800,2,138,4.56
2878585,5,B000S0GYMK,"I love the History Channel, especially when they have something about the occult and paranormal. My favorite one of the five is the Haunted History of Halloween.",1330128000,,161,5.0
2878586,5,B000S0GYMK,"I DO love documentaries and this priced-to-move set from the History Channel was one I couldn't pass up.  Did I learn anything new?  Not particularly, but this collection is ENORMOUSLY entertaining and fun to watch - which I will be doing for many spooky years!",1323388800,,261,4.777777777777778
2878587,5,B000S0GYMK,"I bought this box set a few weeks ago to help me get in the Halloween spirit, so to speak.  I found it to be a great purchase. As per usual with the History Channel, the narration, imagery and general flow of information are all quite satisfying.
The hauntings and poltergeists discs seemed a bit dated (many of the interviewees had hilarious 80's hair & unfortunate outfits), but the other 3-- Halloween, vampires, and witches, were all fantastic.  Since I only paid $20 for five full length documentaries, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these films.  Probably wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers due to the gore and scary factors, but if you're looking for some fascinating history lessons with a liberal dash of spookiness, you will enjoy this buy.",1289692800,2,771,4.825757575757576
2878588,4,B000S0GYMK,"The History and A and E presents come great tales on dvd.

The Haunted History of Halloween started with a rich detailed history of Halloween. However, like most biographies it starts strong and the ending is rushed along. This could have been extended to an hour and half or maybe two hours. Hauntings was a very good dvd in the vein of A Haunting on Disovery Channel or Unsolved Mysterys.
I enjoyed this program alot. Poltergeist contains a story that was on Discovery Channel's A Haunting. I cannot recall to much about the program. I've yet to watch Salem Witch Trails but i'm sure it's just as good. Each program is at least 45 minutes.

Vampire Secrets didn't really interest me at all, it's longer then the other four programs and runs an hour and twenty minutes. I did like the beginning but when it started talking moderen vampires I got bored and chuckled at the idea.

Overall, a very well done setand i'll be looking foward to purchase the other in the Haunted History series.",1262044800,2,988,4.6022727272727275
2878589,5,B000S0GYMK,"I really enjoyed my Haunted History videos.  They were both informative and interesting.  Since Halloween is one of my favorite holidays, I especially enjoyed that video.  I would recommend this set to anyone interested in hauntings, vampires or witches.  They give a historical account of all these ""scary"" things.  Very nice set to own.",1260230400,4,338,5.185185185185185
2878590,4,B000S0GYMK,"I bought the HAUNTED HISTORIES COLLECTION DVD set because it was on sale here on Amazon. I love the History Channel and since it was October, I figured I'd add this set to my DVD library.

With the exception of ""Vampire Secrets"" (with a printed running time of 100-minutes but more like 90-minutes) all of the episodes are under one-hour. The five shows are in plastic clamshell cases and come in a larger cardboard cover box, like in the photo.

Even though I enjoyed the shows, I would only advise buying this set when it's on sale. Most of the episodes were produced in 1997 and don't have the fancy digital gadgets featured in most of the paranormal shows on television today, so the shows ""Hauntings"" and ""Poltergeist"" seem a little dated.

""Vampire Secrets"" was pretty cool and, if the copyright date on the back of the cover is correct, is the most recently produced show of the bunch. Even though it covers the history of vampires and the romantic idolization of the fabled blood-sucker, it was created much too early to cover the new vampire craze with younger girls and boys--like with the ""Twilight"" books and movie, and in anime.

""The Haunted History Of Halloween"" was the show I enjoyed the most because there was great footage of Halloween parades and ""trick or treaters"" from yesteryear. There was also press footage of celebrity Halloween parties and you get to see children of the stars, like Liza Minnelli and Candace Bergen when they were kids. It also talks about how Halloween came about throughout the years.

Get it when it's on sale!",1257120000,13,1558,4.713235294117647

2878595,4,B000S0GYMK,"I always like programs from the History Channel.  They do a very good job of gathering both the obvious information and the little-known background stuff.  I particularly like ""Vampire Secrets"" and ""Salem Witch Trials"".  Well worth the price if you're interested in the supernatural.",1240185600,,283,5.386363636363637

If you are a History buff or have some knowledge on these topics, these DVDs are not for you.  If you know little about these subjects and would like a very brief lesson on these subjects, then you will enjoy these DVDs.

2878601,4,B000S0GYMK,"While this wasn't the Haunted History programs from the History Channel, this collection provides a spookey and interesting insight into things such as hauntings, the witch trials, and the history of Halloween.
The video quality of the discs isn't exactly stellar, but considering most of it was shot in the early '90s, it's in the best quality possible.
The biggest downside of the set is the fact that all five discs come in bulky, full-sized cases.  There are no real inserts to speak of, so why the massive cases?  This set would greatly benefit from  being in 5 slim cases, or even better, 3 slim dual cases.

Otherwise, it's a good set at a great price.  If you're interested in this stuff, I recommend it.",1226793600,2,712,4.664
2878602,5,B000S0GYMK,Haunted History was purchased primarily for the Halloween segment which I had my substitute teacher show to my World History class on Oct 31st while I was away on a trip.  I previewed the video before showing it and felt it gave a nice treatment of the subject.  The other videos I consider a bonus and made this a good buy.
