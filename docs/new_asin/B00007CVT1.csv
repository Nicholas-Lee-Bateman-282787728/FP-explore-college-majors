8135068,4,B00007CVT1,"I enjoyed this movie far more than I thought I would.  I only bought it because it seemed like such a departure for Hasselhoff's usual roles.  But the story was pretty riveting, and I truly empathized with his character.  I also found a lot of the dialogue entertaining; I've always been a fan of one-liners.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the slow pace at the beginning.  Otherwise, I'm sold on it.",1378425600,,432,4.35

8135072,5,B00007CVT1,"Beyond the goofy pun in the title Layover is a rewarding journey that explores Plato's famous theory of the soul. Being a huge aficionado of Platonic discourse it is rumoured that Hasselhoff jumped on this project feet first. This moving movie basically contemporizes the Greek philosophers incendiary response to the licentious Sophists who sought to use their philosophies to manipulate morality. In this movie McElroy and Hasselhoff delve into this issue reminding us the importance of morality, and the way in which it shapes our ability to be truly happy.
Beyond the rigorously researched script McElroy employs some top-notch cinematic techniques. One of the hottest scenes I have been witness to in the last decade of my life (even hotter than the Stone vs. Stallone shower scene in '94s box office smash The Specialist) is the smouldering seduction of ""Dan"" (Hasselhoff) by bearded barman Donald Scufffofi (played by hoary enchantress Yvonne Scio); not only does this scene titillate  (in the most tasteful manner) it also challenges us as viewers. The seduction occurs in a ""baggage"" room, and not only is it ""baggage"" its ""lost baggage"". The room symbolizes for us the emotional load Dan (Hasselhoff) is carrying around with him, but not only that, it is the baggage that is misplaced after years of being a negligent husband. This type of symbolism is skilfully employed throughout the movie, especially found in airport, police station and superette robbery scenes.
To conclude, between Hasselhoff's passion for acting and Platonic discourse and McElroy's skilful direction and dedication to a truly scholarly script the screen explodes with daring, sexy action that is edifying and exciting. Gentlemen, please take a bow.",1073174400,4,1734,5.282608695652174
8135073,4,B00007CVT1,"This is one of many movies that are slow yet you can't keep your eyes off the screen. So I found myself talking to my four legged kids why the character Dan (Hasselhoff) was married to this woman. Hasselhoff's character tried endless reasoning with his wife to no avail she even starts an arguement when he calls her from the airport.  In one scene David Hasselhoff wears (""wears""?)less than his swimsuit has a brief encounter at the airport with a woman of all places in the baggage store room. Things begin to keep you glued to the set after Hasselhoff's character meets the womans husband once again. The ending is just not what you expect and of course it's not what Dan(Hasselhoff) expected either. Although if you're not paying attention to what Dan's (Hasselhoff) occupation is you will find yourself feeling pretty stupid at the end of the movie.  You'll be talking to yourself or your four legged kids and saying ""duh, I totally forgot about that"".  Just remember all the characters are having an affair, no one is who you think they are. The only person who really fairs at the end is Dan (Hasselhoff). I would give David Hasselhoff five stars for this movie I think he's been underated as an actor and a singer it's just the movie was slow it really needed something to pick it up. This is a good acting movie for Hasselhoff he shows us his dramatic side...would I think twice about buying the movie? No, before they are sold out I would purchase the dvd make a bowl of popcorn draw a blanket around you and hope the 120lb dog remembers he's not a poodle, he's not a lap dog the movie and popcorn are yours. Good date movie. Congrats David.",1046217600,5,1651,4.51505016722408
