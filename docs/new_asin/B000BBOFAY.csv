8084482,5,B000BBOFAY,A classic movie!  The characters are great and the acting is very authentic. A very well written script. Looking forward to finding the sequel.,1394496000,,143,4.958333333333333
8084483,4,B000BBOFAY,"Very genre specific, I enjoyed it because it was filmed close to my hometown, part of the draw of the movie for me was seeing the places near my home, and the use of local actors and actresses as extras.  This movie was shot before hurricane Sandy and features shots of the Jersey Shore that you can no longer see.",1354406400,,314,4.233333333333333
8084484,2,B000BBOFAY,"This movie is worth owning if you can find it cheaply and you're an American Pit Bull Terrier enthusiast and want everything related to the breed.  That's the best I can say about it.

Otherwise, hang on to your money, or rent a copy.  I've got an old VHS version of this movie, and in all the years I've had it, I believe I've only watched it twice.  (And I think it likely that the 2nd viewing was just to make sure that I hadn't missed any redeeming qualities that the film didn't appear to have.)  The high point for me was when one of the characters couldn't pronounce Durango.  The rest of the movie was so bad I've blocked most of it out.  Just chalk it up to an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.

Sorry I can't give a more detailed review, but that just gives you an idea of how lame this movie is.  I can't remember anything about it except the basics of the plot.  And nothing about it would inspire me to go back and reacquaint myself.",1221436800,,965,4.085106382978723
