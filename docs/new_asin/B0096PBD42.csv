5274044,5,B0096PBD42,"When Charlie's Angels came out we could get the first four seasons. We all waited for season five to come out for a long time, but what they released was the whole series box set, as if we would not ever see a season 5. Well, later they released season 5 after everyone bought the entire series. Looks like they are messing around with the Hart to Hart series as well. Why can't Sony just release seasons 3, 4 and 5. I want the 8 Hart to Hart movies but I want to see all of the original series first. And we shouldn't have to rebuy some of the Hart to Hart stuff just to get the other part we don't have, which is what happen with the Charlie's Angels DVDs. So beware people. Also the Charlie's Angels box set has all white, completely blank DVDs. No graphics on them at all. I don't know if the HH movie collections are like that or not. I would have to buy them to know. Please release seasons 3, 4 and 5. And finally, I'm not paying the stupid prices for the movies when a whole season of Hart to Hart is now less than twenty dollars.",1372723200,15,1038,4.068292682926829

5274047,2,B0096PBD42,"Thank goodness I bought Hart to Hart Seasons 1 AND 2 a few years ago from Half Price Books.  They might have been around $10 for each season, but I KNOW they were under $20.  And now they are $75?  I wasn't sure how to do the star rating -- definitely a 5 for the series itself, but the price is ridiculous.",1351468800,4,307,3.9193548387096775
5274048,1,B0096PBD42,"To con't the review on Hart to Hart vol 2 tv movie series  Wow  reviews are pouring in for the demand of a product
Sony  75.99  on vol 1 and 2  over 150.00 dollars  who has that amount of cash!  MARKET ON DEMAND  apparently the public wants this product all of Hart to  Hart  Tv movies the series  We will buy the product however a few can only afford that price  perhaps marketing 101 should come into effect  Sony will get more money if the product is affordable to everyone's purse  Think about it Sony  Amazon help us",1350604800,,521,4.173469387755102
5274049,1,B0096PBD42,"I don't blame Amazon for the prices of these two sets of movies (Vol 1 and Vol 2). This is a problem with the people releasing these, Sony MOD (manufacture on demand)!! Not only did Sony decide not to finish the rest of the seasons to complete this excellant series starring Robert Wagner, Stefanie Powers and Lionel Stander by making them available at retail stores, now they insult the wonderful work done on this excellant tv series by making them so unaffordable that fans like myself who are on fixed incomes (like a whole lot of people out there!!) can't afford to buy them! Really a slap in the face to all us fans! Shame on SONY! RP",1348444800,46,640,4.432203389830509
