It begins with people dancing on a boat off Cape Cod. A young boy jumps off the boat to see an underwater creature! Twenty years pass. Men are unloading produce. A shipment of cherries was spoiled, the buyer gets satisfaction. [Is that any way to run a business?] The older brother is a salesman, the younger brother handles the details. Wheres Victoria? Freddy had an outgoing personality. Allen wants to go to Cape Cod. [A cab ride to Cape Cod?] Will he find trouble? Can he swim? Does that scientist have group skills? Wholl save Allen? Do you speak English? That long-haired blond girl swims like a fish! [No gills?] Back in New York business goes on. A woman walks toward the Statue of Liberty. A telephone call summons Allen away. Love at first sight? He takes her back to his apartment. Then he returns to work, happy.

Allens guest learned a word: Bloomingdales. She watches advertising, then visits another store. TV is educational. Whats you r name? She is a fast learner. Whats that? Cars brake for her. Madison? Where will she stay? Salt for her bath? Yes! She has a secret that she keeps hidden. Shy? Back at Cape Cod that scientist keeps working (there are comic scenes). TV is make-believe. [Dont many people forget that?] Madison gets a gift. They travel around the city. Allen wants to take Madison to an important political dinner. [Freddy is not in good physical shape.] Freddy has an explanation for Madisons appearance. Is something wrong with her? Back home Allen gets a big surprise. That scientist calls a meeting but is not believed. He has a plan. Unless he makes a mistake! Allen has a plan to get around immigration laws. Madisons table manners are noteworthy, and attract attention. Shes really hungry.

We see ice skating in New York. Will she marry Allen? No. She has only three days left. It begins to rain, Madison seeks shelter. [We see the old World Trade Center towers from across Brooklyn.] Madison returns to say Yes. Will that scientist make another mistake? There is dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria for the President. The Secret Service men are on guard. That scientist manages to spray Madison and she is transformed! The press crowds around. Scientists experiment on Allen. [Who is crazy here?] Madison drops in too! Interaction fails.

The press crowds around Allen foe the latest sensation. Freddy gives unasked for advice too. Can he help Allen find Madison? They go to the American Museum of Natural History and find Madison. Dont let anybody in that room! But their trick is discovered, soldiers are sent to get her back. A car chase adds action. Kornblue has a plan. Allen and Madison escape to lower Manhattan. Can they continue? Yes, but Allen cant come back. Leave her alone! Allen jumps in and is rescued. Can they live happily ever after? Will love conquer all? You have to imagine the ending.

Would a sophisticated New Yorker fall in love with a creature from the Ocean? They make it sound reasonable. Or was this comedy meant to be a satire about life? Notice the product placement. Can government forces grab a person off the street and imprison them without a trial? Was this a subtle warning about the actions of the Reagan administration? Maybe not at this time. Isnt there too much comedy for what was intended to be a fantasy story? Can there be an unusual marriage between spouses?",1395100800,,3361,4.748287671232877
