8449773,4,B004ZH34W0,"I saw this 1975 film when it first came out under the English title of END OF THE GAME which literally describes what happens but is not nearly as appropriate as the original title of THE JUDGE & HIS HANGMAN. If you are familiar with Swiss playwright/novelist Friedrich Durrenmatt (THE VISIT, THE PHYSICISTS) then you know what to expect. Durrenmatt is like a Swiss Samuel Beckett with a little of Harold Pinter thrown in for good measure. On the surface this is a standard murder mystery that isn't that hard to figure out. That isn't the point. How it arrives at its solution, the past incident that drives it, and the neatly absurdist dialogue that the major characters exchange are what END OF THE GAME is really about.

Maximillian Schell, who is much better known for his acting, directed a handful of films of which this is undoubtedly the strangest. In fact it is splendidly strange. That is why it plays better today than it did then. Most Americans (certainly the reviewers) didn't get it at all. The scene with Donald Sutherland as a corpse, his rain soaked funeral, and the verbal exchanges between Martin Ritt and Jon Voight and Ritt and Robert Shaw should have tipped them off. This is no ordinary run-of-the-mill mystery even if the murder turns out to have been extremely ordinary.

The movie is one of those international or Continental films that were so popular in the 1970s with a mixed cast of British, American, and European actors. Some of the dubbing leaves a lot to be desired and that is even true of the original German soundtrack but it doesn't really detract from the proceedings. It actually adds to the strangeness. Jon Voight, Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Shaw were already well known performers but casting director Martin Ritt (who had acted early in his Actors Studio days) was definitely an eccentric move but Ritt acquits himself well. Schell himself makes a brief cameo appearance (playing the piano for Pinchas Zukerman) and there's another cameo from silent screen star Lil Dagover (CABINET OF DR CALIGARI) as Shaw's mother. Fittingly she doesn't utter a word.

I have waited patiently for years for 20th Century Fox to release this title on home video but had to settle for a DVD-R copied off the Fox Movie Channel until now. As another reviewer pointed out, the lack of subtitles is unfortunate as it is clear there are substantial differences between the German and English soundtracks. I was able to access the special features on my American Blu-Ray player but without subtitles I can't understand what Maximillian Schell has to say about the film. Perhaps my wife, who speaks German, can interpret. Anyway, no matter where it comes from, I am delighted to have this in a more than respectable transfer with good sound. It has always been one of my personal favorites.",1461024000,4,2813,4.819875776397516

It's based on Friedrich Durrenmatt's own crime novella, ""The Judge and His Hangman"" (1950).  So if you've read Durrenmatt, you'll know he's sort of an absurdist like Samuel Beckett or Eugene Ionesco.

I liked the film at the start, it's oddly weird, especially the funeral of Donald Sutherland with musical mourners and precipitation.  It's hilarious.  Another funny scene is when Donald Sutherland is being driven in a car by a Swiss cop and he keeps falling over in the seat.

I think the problem ultimately is that the whole film seemed like some idiotic farce that was entirely pointless, and it threw it an ""unexpected ending"" type of denouement that was weak.

Donald Sutherland is some cop who's found whacked in a car, and a Swiss Kommisar, played capably by Martin Ritt (American director, Hud (1963), The Molly Maguires (1970), Hombre (1967)) snoops around trying to find out who did it.  He uses the aid of Jon Voight, who's another cop.  Robert Shaw as ""Gastmann"" is an ominous character who may or may have not done the killing.  There's plenty of fine acting and odd moments, good direction, but again, it gets bogged down too much in idiosyncratic reactions or convoluted conversations.

Martin Ritt and Robert Shaw made some type of bet involving the death/murder of some woman both of them loved.

Look for Friedrich Durrenmatt himself as some old ""self-playing chess"" crank who helps out Jon Voight.

It's worth a look for all its faults.",1460505600,,1498,4.873517786561265
8449775,4,B004ZH34W0,"An interesting film directed by Maximilian Schell and starring Jon Voight, Jacqueline Bisset, director Martin Ritt in a superlative interpretation and Robert Shaw as a creepy villain.  Good quality image and sound.",1428883200,,214,5.6875
8449776,2,B004ZH34W0,"A police officer (Donald Sutherland) is found dead in his car with a gunshot wound to the head.  Commissioner Hans Baerlach (Martin Ritt) and Detective Walter Tschanz (Jon Voight) both investigate the crime but each seems to have his own agenda--Baerlach plants evidence at the scene of the murder and Tschanz immediately beds his dead colleague's gorgeous girlfriend (Jacqueline Bisset) and reacts violently to hearing the man's voice on an answering machine message.

Actor turned director Maximilian Schell directs the first half of End of the Game as absurd comedy--Donald Sutherland famously took a cameo as a dead body in this film but there are some Weekend at Bernie's style hijinks as the body is transported from the scene of the crime, giving Sutherland a lot more to do than you would expect considering that he's playing a corpse.

Maximilian Schell who also co-wrote the screenplay fills his scenes with odd dialogue and bizarre character behavior that makes End of the Game feel more Alice in Wonderland than Agatha Christie.  It's fun at first--Maximilian Schell clearly enjoys using Donald Sutherland as a gag in a way that wouldn't work if the role weren't cast with a recognizable star.  He also gets an uncharacteristically silly performance from Jon Voight who at this point in his career could mostly be counted on for taking himself way too seriously.  Unfortunately all the scenes that seem to go round and round in circles because of the absurd dialogue and broad performances become tiresome and repetitive after a while--then Schell tries to change the film's tone when villain Richard Gastmann (Robert Shaw--the best thing in the film by a wide margin) is introduced.

Robert Shaw is allowed to play his part straight and End of the Game seems to turn into an entirely different movie after he appears on-screen.  The problem is that Shaw's Gastmann illustrates how dark the central story of End of the Game actually is which makes Schell's decision to play the first half of the film for laughs seem both frivolous and ill-advised.  It's possible a more skilled director like Roman Polanski could have pulled off the combination of dark humor and unexpected tragedy that Maximilian Schell seems to be going for but Schell doesn't and the longer one watches End of the Game the more it feels like the writer/director has no control whatsoever over the tone of his film.

It's likely just an interesting bit of coincidence that Maximilian Schell was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar the same year this was made for starring in a film adaptation of Robert Shaw's play The Man in the Glass Booth.  Still Robert Shaw completely owns this movie despite the fact that he doesn't turn up until the second half--he makes for a wonderfully evil villain and his scenes opposite Martin Ritt's weary Commissioner Baerlach are so good I found myself frustrated that Maximilian Schell didn't choose to play End of the Game straight from scene one.

If you enjoy crime films End of the Game is certainly an unusual addition to the field and might be worth sitting through once for that reason alone but it's ultimately a frustrating and unsatisfying movie that never finds a workable balance between its twin impulses towards absurdist humor and mournful tragedy.",1426550400,,3276,4.958029197080292
8449777,4,B004ZH34W0,"Let's get the technicalities out of the way:
This is a release of a 1978 production. The Blu-Ray disk will play on American (and presumably German) Blu-ray players. There are two audio options - German and English mono soundtracks: that's DTS 1.0, despite what it says in the Amazon description. Mono: just like the original film. The quality of video and audio is very good. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find subtitles. This is slightly annoying, since we were hoping that we could use the film to augment our German course (we're using the book as a text). We've also been unable to activate the 'extras', which may or may not be caused by the fact that we're watching the film from an American player. These are minor problems.

As for the film:
Maximilian Schell's production made a few modifications to the original text: some players had a bigger role, some had less, some died, but these don't detract from the story, and it's clear that Duerrenmatt didn't mind, since he has a cameo appearance as the Writer. I'm going to avoid any spoilers, for those of you who haven't read the book, but drop a few hints, for those of you who have.

Anna, Schmied's girlfriend, has a much more important role than in the book, but since this involves an excuse to introduce Jacqueline Bisset, it has my approval.

Donald Sutherland, on the other hand, has the most thankless cameo in film history, as Schmied's corpse. No change to the book,but his performance as the Chinese Sage was worthy of an Oscar.

Martin Ritt's Brlach was spot on - he showed the aging detective still ahead of his game, despite his terminal illness. The Last Supper was disappointing - just Wurst and Sauerkraut, rather than the courses described in the book.

Brlach's opposite number, Gastman, was ably portrayed by Robert Shaw, as a smiling sociopath.

John Voight's portrayal of Tschanz was suitably... disturbing.

The production fills in some blanks (which is unusual for a film), where the book left a few holes.

For completists, there are plenty of occasions in the film, where the action does not exactly match the book, and there are a few references at the end where we are forewarned about the events in  der Verdacht, the next Brlacht mystery.

If you're familiar with Duerrenmatt's book, give this film a try. It's an attempt by a sensitive, intelligent director to express the book's main points in cinematic form.

Strongly recommended.",1369872000,4,2431,4.805755395683454
