This film offers a unique, historical look into former East Deutschland ~ Sachsen Anhalt. However, the DVD is narrated in the German language only, without [English] subtitles. In addition, most of the footage appears in black and white, which may be suited to its archive.  Also, the disc malfunctioned in some of our DVD players, but that may be related to its supply-on-demand manufacturing (?).

However, this DVD is still very much recommended, offering one-of-a-kind footage into the beautiful city of Halle, and its remarkable history.
