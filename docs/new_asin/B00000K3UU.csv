1241144,5,B00000K3UU,"As a fan of Adam Sandler, I feel that he's really come into his own with his portrayal of Sonny in ""Big Daddy"".  His character was the same immature type of slacker, but it had a very human side.  It was a real  character, someone that I believed in by the end of the movie, kind of like  Robbie in the ""Wedding Singer"".  Sandler non-fans will probably  care less for it than Sandler fans, but who cares?  Another Hit!!!",937094400,,420,4.2405063291139244

1241269,5,B00000K3UU,"Big Daddy sees the beloved Adam Sandler play as Sonny Kaufax, a 32 year old unmotivated, unreliable slacker who's spent most of his adult years trying to avoid adult responsibilities the world brings. Sonny's severe case of Peter Pan syndrome causes his girlfriend, Vanessa to break up with him and leave him.

Upon losing the one person that always had faith in him, Sonny decides to try to prove a way he's ready to mature--and that's where fate steps in. One morning, Sonny wakes up to find a 5 year old, Julian at his apartment. A note comes with him from his mother explaining that she no longer wants to care for Julian and is handing the responsibilities down to Kevin, Sonny's roommate and allegedly the biological father of Julian. Kevin however denies being the father and is unable to care for Julian at the moment due to a business trip he's attending in China.

Sonny, not left with much of a choice, decides to adopt Julian---mainly as a means to try and impress and win back the heart of Vanessa. However, he's disappointed to discover that not only is she NOT impressed with him adopting a kid, but that she's already gotten with someone else who seems to be much more mature than Sonny and has his life figured out with a 5 Year Plan. Impressive.....right? Suddenly Sonny feels like he's been thrown in an unfortunate situation but before he knows it, he becomes attached to the little guy and forms a near unbreakable bond with him",1448755200,,1449,4.612403100775194

I believe it is one of Adam Sandler's best movies because of him working with the twins in this one. He has his normal crew like he has for all Happy Madison produced movies, but the story is a little different than usual for him. He assumes the father role for a kid who claims to be the child of his roommate (a very young Jon Stewart) who is engaged to be married to a different woman. He tries to pretend to be his father to try and protect his friend's relationship. Having the kid element in the movie is so funny and Sandler is great at working with them (the Sprout twins). I would give the movie a 4/5, I couldn't really give an Adam Sandler movie higher than that but it is one of his best.",1440547200,3,839,4.0

1241433,1,B00000K3UU,"A year before Johnny Knoxville even dreamed about trying to kill himself, Adam Sandler came up with the idea of flushing his brain down the toilet before jackass did. Big Daddy has Sandler living the contemporary American dream by living off of somebody else. Somehow he got a girlfriend (she probably felt sorry for him). Tired of him being such a loser, she dumps him. Somehow he ends up taking care of a kid who doesn't talk in order to prove he is responsible to get his girlfriend back. The kid doesn't respond to anything until Sandler accidently gets run over by a car. The way the kid laughs at people's possible injuries, he would probably have an orgasm if someone died. After he realizes the kid's potential, and starting him out at a young age, Sandler gives him full-on loser training. He continues entertaining the kid featuring a stick placed strategically in a skater's path with him tumbling down and practically breaking his neck. I heard a rumor that suspected terrorists at Guantanimo are subliminally tortured with Adam Sandler movies and makes them beg for water boarding. Sandler eternally becomes known as the original jackass as he trips, falls, and no matter what he does or says, there is always people proving their low I.Q.'s by showing up in droves for his movies as they chew bubble gum and text message all the way through. After ""Big Daddy"", the media exploded with real and fake versions of intentional, predictable, bodily harm resulting in a new sensation of people having to break bones, or bleed to make us laugh. I guess we got too bored with regular comedy. The vhs of ""big daddy"" needs to be pan and scan, mono audio, black and white, with no chance for a dvd release, but unfortunately it is on dvd.",1363737600,,1741,4.6742671009771986

 The movie is very funny, well-written, and a joy to watch with your children.

1241512,3,B00000K3UU,"Growing up is sometimes hard to do.  You leave behind the carefree days when someone else was still responsible for you as you took your first steps towards independence.  Our parents did the best they could in cutting the umbilical cord and sending us on our way.  For most of us, this transition felt normal and was achieved without much pain.  However, for a few, growing pains continued beyond what was considered normal or prudent.

Over Memorial Day weekend, I sort of had an old movie watching extravaganza and ended up watching a few films.  One of these films was Big Daddy.  Big Daddy was produced in 1999 and featured the Sprouse twins (Dylan and Cole) playing the same role of  Julian ""Frankenstein"" McGrath who is a 5 year child sent from Buffalo, New York to be reunited with this father who he has never seen.  His mother has passed away and she wanted Julian to be with his biological Dad.  Of course, this is also a big surprise for everyone including Gerrity.

The unfortunate thing is that Dad (Kevin Gerrity' who is played by Jon Stewart) does not know anything about Julian or in fact that he even exists and as fate has it is on his way to China on business.  Sonny Koufax played by Adam Sandler is the one who opens the door and finds the five year Julian on his stoop.  Sonny in the end finds more than Julian that fateful day and learns a lot about himself.

Adam Sandler as his typical funny self plays a bright would be lawyer who  is an irresponsible slob; a guy who cannot get it altogether even though all of his friends have moved on with their careers and lives sort of leaving him far behind.  Adam is feeling this particularly when he opens his door and finds Julian standing there; since Sandler also just found himself losing his girlfriend to boot.

The film shows Adam at his funny best and if you are a Sandler fan you will like this movie. Layla Maloney played by Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet role and Adams in this role reminds me a little of Renee Zellwegger in Jerry Maguire.

In the final analysis, love wins out and everybody lives happily ever.  The movie promotes family love and values and is a feel good movie which most likely if you are a Jon Stewart or an Adam Sandler fan will not disappoint you.

Some coarse segments as another reviewer mentioned which influenced me and was one of the reasons that I did not give it four stars though I enjoyed the movie on the whole very much.  It was funny, light and kept you laughing.  If you intend to watch this flick with your children, there are more than a few stunts that you may not enjoy your own children doing or getting any ideas about.  So be forewarned.  But overall still a funny film.

Three stars for this feel good movie.

1241514,5,B00000K3UU,"Adam Sandler seems to spark negative opinions more often than not.  Some people don't like his style of humor, while other people just think he's overrated.  But in my opinion, he's a great actor who can be really funny at times, and sometimes not so funny.  It really just depends on the kind of story he's involved with for whatever movie he's in.

However, this is one really rare moment when his humor is not overbearing and completely tolerable for just about anyone to get into.  You have plenty of emotions where Adam and the child character communicate with each other in such a way where you can't help but enjoy Adam's character.  Every actor needs a movie like this in their long and winding career.

Sure, at the time we weren't sure if a comedian such as Adam Sandler would fit in with this kind of role in a movie.  Over time we see that yes, it worked very well.  Great movie.",1205884800,,891,4.41717791411043

Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.

The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good, though what was the point of incorporating a homosexual couple into this movie?  It came out of the blue and served no purpose whatsoever, except to taint the overall mood.

Sonny decides he can take care of him until Social Services can find an foster home for him, but Sonny falls in love with the kid and avoids Social Services. Then Social Services finds out Sonny was using Kevin's name and they take the kid away. Sonny tries to fight for him, but unable to get him and custody goes to the real Kevin who is in China for most of the movie. Juilan wants Sonny to be his dad, but Sonny says he can't, but he can always be his friend. So the movie ends at a happy note.

During the movie you'll have some laughs, giiggles and some tear jerking scenes. The funniest part of the movie is the court room scene, with Nazo, Mr. Hurley and the Bum. I almost cried when Social Services takes Julien away.

1241535,5,B00000K3UU,"Yes, I am an Adam Sandler fan, but I'm not obsessed about him as some of his other fans are. I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny. Most critics batter him for childish antics, bathroom humor, violent slapstick, and immaturity. True, he can childish and immature in his humor, but he is just lovable enough to get away with it. Anyway, the people I know like to laugh at the one-liners and antics of BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WATERBOY. but not a lot people talk about BIG DADDY as much, and that's too bad.

Meet Sonny (Sandler), a 32-year-old law school grad on the fast track to nowhere: Rather than take a high-paying job in a high-powered New York City firm, Sonny works one night a week in a tollbooth and hangs out with the deli delivery guy (Rob Schneider). Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five-year-old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law-school buddy Kevin (Jon Stewart), who's just left for China. No problem, thinks Sonny: A son will get his life on track and help him win back his wayward girlfriend (Kristy Swanson). But when a compromising situation arises and Sonny's girlfriend dumps him, Sonny gets desperate and has social services look for a family that can take Julian. Instead of letting Julian end up in an orphanage he volenteers to look after him, giving the kid options instead of orders, letting him dress however he likes, bathe when he wants and eat what he likes, but soon he realizes that he needs to set boundries for the kid in order for him to excell school. Sonny starts to bond with the kid. But after ignoring calls from social services, Sonny is taken to court for Fraudulently hold Julian under his biological father's name.

I think this is one of Sandler's best, not only because he's downplaying his humor impulse to stutter like Bobby Boucher, get violent like Happy Gilmore, or act childish like Billy Madison. But because he seems to have matured a bit as an actor and as a person. His humor is dry, but funny. Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy. Adam has really come a far way since BILLY MADISON, he's a hell of a lot more calmer, and a little bit more likable to the non-Sandler-fan community. Yes there is some bodily humor here, but it's marginal and it doesn't come from Adam, which is good because it wouldn't wear well on a man in his mid-30s as it would on a little kid. All in all, if you're not a Sandler-fan, you're better off not watching his earlier stuff first, because he can get carried away with the childish humor, so start off slow and watch BIG DADDY, THE WEDDING SINGER, or 50 FIRST DATES.",1145750400,4,2753,4.515030060120241
1241536,5,B00000K3UU,"The review from ""The New Yorker"" on this page is probably one of the most pompous and hollow reviews I've ever read. ""Big Daddy"" is a great movie.  I'm a long-time Adam Sandler fan but, put it this way, after seeing this movie, so is my mother. She's usually not into this kind of comedy, but this has become one of her all-time favorite movies.  So, saying that ""Anyone looking to solve the mystery of Adam Sandler's mass appeal is not going to do it here"" seems to be a ridiculous statement.

The movie is funny from ""all angles"".  The story is good, the cast is as solid as I've ever seen in a comedy, etc, etc... Whether or not you're usually into Sandler's brand of comedy, you will most likely appreciate this film. I feel that this is Adam Sandler at his best - and it is certainly one of his most successful projects.

Highly recommended.",1144800000,16,846,4.3630573248407645
1241537,5,B00000K3UU,"I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler. I am a huge fan of the Sprouse twins. I am a huge fan of Jon Stewart - lets face it, I'm a huge fan of everyone in this movie. But that doesn't make my review biased because the movie is what MADE me fans of them.

The story is a 30-something law-school graduate slacker named Sonny Koufax (Sandler) who finds a kid on his doorstep, Julian (Cole & Dylan Sprouse). Apparently the kid is his roommate's from a one-night fling 6 years ago. Perfect. His roommate Kevin (Jon Stewart) just left for China on business.

Realizing his girlfriend is about to leave him, Koufax gets an idea. He 'pretends' to adopt little Julian by calling himself the biological father, fooling social services. Too late, his girlfriend ain't coming back. Now he's stuck with the kid, so he tells social services to call him when a foster family gets lined up.

Over the weeks Koufax comes to genuinely love the little kid. When a foster family appears ready to take Julian (recently dubbed 'Frankenstein') away, Koufax is about to call it all off and make it permanent - but social services finds out he's not Kevin Gerrity.

Sonny ends up taking the whole thing to court.

I personally think this is Adam Sandler at his absolute best. It delivers the laughs that Sandler always promises, but also has a heartwarming, sentimental side - and amazingly, it doesn't take away from the comedy.

I can sum it all up in five words: YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.",1139961600,3,1458,4.503787878787879

Sonny wants to gain his girl friends attention. After finding a little child beside his door (Jullian) he soon becomes atatched.

Although Sonny uses him alittle for attention, he soon realizes Jullians position and is willing to take him in for good.

This movie has its funny moments and a plot that i can actual believe. The music was awsome with the Garbage song ""When I Grow Up""

1241541,5,B00000K3UU,"Let me start off my review by saying that Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian,and that I have all of Sandler's albums and I have seen and own a lot of his movies. Yes,BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are both hillarious and classic comedy films-but what is the best movie Adam Sandler has made? In my opinion,that honor goes to BIG DADDY-which not only has everything an Adam Sandler film usually has to it and is,but it also has everything any kind of comedy film needs. Read on for my review of this:

This time,Adam Sandler is Sonny Koufax,a young male living in New York City who has never wanted reponsibility. Koufax works at a toll booth,and his dad,one of the most respected lawyers in Florida,has been,as Koufax puts it,hassling him his whole life to get a job. Koufax is a grown man,so he doesn't exactly have to do what his dad wants him to do now,correct? Correct-but there is a problem. The problem is that his girlfriend,Vanessa,is sick of Sonny being so lazy and is not sure whether or not she should stay with him. Oh no...what is Sonny going to do now?

Sonny is not exactly sure what to do to make Vanessa want to stay with him...but then,something happens that Sonny thinks could help him get Vanessa to stay with him. One morning,a five-year old boy named Julian shows up at his Manhattan apartment after he has been dropped off by an older kid who is probably about fourteen or fifteen years old. After one of Sonny's closest friends,Kevin(Jon Stewart)claims that Julian is not his son,Sonny takes responsibility for Julian-and after he finds out that Vanessa has left him for an older man,funny,sad,and heartwarming events continue on for about an hour or so.

BIG DADDY is one of the best ""parenting"" films ever made. Some parents say that they don't want their children watching this film because some of the things they(Adam Sandler and the two twins in this film who played Julian,Cole and Dylan Sprouse)do in this film are stupid--OK,so that may be true,but WHO CARES???!!! It's a film-and it's a hillarious film also. With this film,Adam Sandler brought out the goofy kid he played in BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and helped make a film that already had a lot going for it really great,really sweet,and really funny.

This film,without question,is a must see film-no matter how old you are.",1120953600,2,2321,4.723456790123457
1241542,5,B00000K3UU,"Adam Sandler is always entertaining, but Big Daddy never really piqued my interest; looking back now, I think the previews of this film did it a disservice.  Certainly, Big Daddy has its course moments, but it's an excellent comedy that just so happens to have a heart.  Some would say this film sets a bad example for kids.  First of all, this isn't one of those education films of the 1950s that tells you how to be a good parent.  More importantly, though, what you have here is a guy who is more than willing to ""grow up"" and change his life in order to be a father to a kid he genuinely loves.  Plenty of fathers in the world raise their kids to be little gentlemen and ladies, but often it's more about a father not wanting his son or daughter to embarrass him than it is about genuine fatherly love.  To me, Big Daddy is - in its own quirky, Sandler-ish way - a tribute to all the fathers out there who genuinely love their children.

As usual, Sandler plays a character who has never really grown up; Sonny Koufax is a law school graduate, but he works in a toll booth one day a week and basically tries to live as if he is still an undergrad.  His girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) wants a man of means and goals, and he's trying to figure out how to get her back when little Julian (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse) is literally dropped at his doorstep.  It's not even his kid; the biological father is Sonny's roommate who has just left town on business.  Sonny tells his newly-engaged buddy that he will handle everything, initially planning just to keep the kid until Social Services opens the next day - but he can't let little Julian be tossed into an orphanage.  He doesn't exactly follow Dr. Spock's rules for parenthood, but Sonny soon comes to love the little tyke - even after it becomes clear that he and Vanessa are through.  When Social Services finds a family for Julian, Sonny can't give him up - until he's forced to.  The fact that he posed as the kid's biological father doesn't stand him in good stead when he tries to get custody of the kid, but he's determined to try.

Sonny teaches Julian a lot of dubious things, but he also does the kid right when he realizes that his laissez faire parenting method isn't what is best for the child when it comes to schoolwork and the like - and he comes up with some pretty ingenious ways to inspire Julian.  Before this film is through, there are actually a few heartwarming moments - which are accomplished without sacrificing any of the comedy.  The cast is great (even Jon Stewart isn't all that bad); Joey Lauren Adams in particular brings a special something to the film as Sonny's new girlfriend.

I don't, as a rule, enjoy comedies built around children doing some of the disgusting things that children do, but Big Daddy was a pleasant, very entertaining surprise.  You can't really go wrong with a Sandler movie - laughs are guaranteed, and there's almost always much more to the story than you might expect.",1120867200,5,2991,4.4568807339449545
1241543,5,B00000K3UU,"Big Daddy is a movie in which Adam Sandler stars as a toll booth guy ( Sonny Koufax ) trying to raise a kid on his own to impress his "" girlfriend "" Vanessa (Kristy Swanson).

Big Daddy is my favorite Sandler movie, and one of my favorite ever movies, simply because of its humor and simple enough story. Some people think that some intended humor in this movie was pointless and stupid, but I highly dissagree. There are jokes throughout this entire movie, even sometimes during ""emotional"" times. if you haven't seen this movie by now, I feel bad for you, because this movie even has Rob Schneider (Nazo), Sonny's ""best friend"", who is a delivery guy, and is funny throughout the movie. Steve Buscemi is also in this movie, playing the Homeless guy, who also adds some humor into the already funny movie.

Why do some people say ""this is a movie that creates bad examples for kids""? Well, yeah it might, but they also must forget the fact this is rated PG-13, so kids if they don't wanna shouldn't watch it then.

Anyways, obviously buy this movie. If you don't; "" I'll give you a crew cut mister. """,1120521600,5,1101,4.4405940594059405
1241544,3,B00000K3UU,"I own this DVD and I have to admit that I NEVER watch it. It was an ok movie but it's not aa good one to buy. It's a great rent with some very funny jokes that you'll laugh about for a while. But, because of the lame plot, and because it's lame at time and not funny, and because it's not a good but, I'm giving it 3 stars. The movie's about a guy that adopts a child to please his girlfriend. But she dumps him after cheating on him and doesn't care. The man doesn't have a big bond with the kid but it starts to develop. The man teaches his son a lot of bad habits like peeing in public, eating like a pig, and lets him name himself.

The movie has some funny jokes but the movie kind of is lame and very childish and pointless at times. I guarantee that it will deliver some laughs but I don't think that this is one to own. Like most of Sandler's movies, they're good rents but not usually good buys.",1120003200,,904,3.939890710382514

Besides it being an ""Insert Cute Little Boy"" movie, I would say that it does okay.  Even though the humor relies heavily on this...and Rob Schneider plays ANOTHER annoying man.

I'm tired of Rob Schneider.

I remember when it first came out, and everyone was relating everything to SCUBA STEVE! from the movie.  I saw the Scuba Steve........""joke""?.........and thought it was...okay....but not worth saying out loud a second time for people to hear.  This movie should be buried.  I like Mr. Deeds better.  You should see National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 instead of this anyway.  So what are you doing with this?  Go buy National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1.  It's much better.",1099958400,,818,4.840579710144928
1241556,4,B00000K3UU,"This movie is definitely a new direction for Sandler.  If you're tired of the nonstop big-kid antics in Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, then you'll probably like this movie.  Sandler plays a thirty-something law-school graduate who is unemployed, but relies on an accident insurance settlement for his income.

Until one day...

His roommate (Jon Stewart) has just left for China on a business trip, and his son by a one-night stand shows up on their doorstep.  Since Sandler's girlfriend has threatened to dump him if he didn't start to do something with his life, he decides to adopt little Julian (played by twin brothers) by claiming to be the guy who is really his roommate.  After taking care of the kid for several days, he inevitably becomes attached to him.  Just one problem: the Social Services Department finds out what he's up to, and tries to take Julian away.  It's a touching role that Sandler plays, as the guy who never grew up, but instantly gains 20 years in maturity when he tries to become a father.  With a great cast, including always-funny Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi among others, and a great music selection (nice to hear Styx in a modern movie, even Sheryl Crow covering ""Sweet Child O' Mine""), this movie will probably become a classic family movie, despite some harsh language here and there (just as much by the kid as the adults: you know how funny kids are when they repeat what the adults say without knowing what it means).  This movie is definitely one of Sandler's best ever.",1093478400,,1516,4.730038022813688
1241557,4,B00000K3UU,"Adam Sandler is not a great actor.  Like many of his compatriates, he is a personality.  In BIG DADDY, though, he appears to have worked on his thespian abilities, and after the movie gets into swing (after he adopts little Julian), he settles into the role and becomes rather convincing in it.  Although some of the humor is deliberately off color, one can't help but find it funny because a kid is involved.  How many times have we had to stifle a laugh because a kid has repeated something he's heard from an adult, and has no idea what he's saying?  That's the kind of crudeness delivered in BIG DADDY.  Along with Sandler, we get a delightful performance from Dylan and Cole Sprouse as Julian.  How can one not develop an immediate attachment to such a cute little kid?  Joey Lauren Adams oozes maternal sweetness as Layla, the girl Sandler falls in love with; Leslie Mann is perfectly bitchy as Corinne; Jon Stewart does well in his role as Kevin, the kid's real father; Rob Schneider is fun as the European delivery boy; and veteran character actor Joe Bologna is perfect as Sandler's disgusted father.  Add a nice bit by the reliable Steve Buscemi as a homeless man and you have a pretty tight cast.

BIG DADDY is another one of those raucous feel good movies (like THE HOT CHICK and JOE DIRT), and one can't help but get caught up in its shameless sentimentality.",1091577600,,1372,4.563265306122449

I mean, what are you supposed to do when a kid shows up on your doorstep and you're told that he's your roommate's son, but your roommate is off on a business trip? Julian is an adorable little guy, and you can really see that he got attached to Sonny, only to be told that he had to go away by the social services. That tugs at the heartstrings, especially when Julian is being led out of Sonny's apartment by the social worker repeating ""But I wipe my own ass!"", thinking that it was his fault he had to go away. Adam Sandler's character really showed a soft side when he gave that speech in court when it was going to be decided whether Julian would stay with him or with the adoption services.

Then I bought the movie.  This is not a family friendly movie becuase the language is to salty.

To take care of the child he decides to make a fantasy world without rules and obstacles; in other words, he loves the boy in a very special way. What makes you wanna keep on seeing the movie is that the central theme is seen as something not necessaryly serious, so it is fun to see what's gonna happen next with this particular pair of ""clawns"".

1241578,3,B00000K3UU,"I think that by this time in Adam Sandler's career, there are two kinds of fans: ones who either hate him, or love him.  And to be blunt, his roles in most of his movies are not that great.  For instance; playing the title character in ""Happy Gilmore"", he was a hockey/golf pro.  In ""The Waterboy"" he played a retarted waterboy.  And in ""Little Nicky"" he played the Devil's son.  Now, all of these roles are not ones that we can relate to.  But yet we still loved those films, and with good reason.
But in ""Big Daddy"", Sandler plays Sonny Koufax.  What makes this role so much better is that there's a sense of love from within.  When a young boy (Cole/Dylan Sprouse) is left outside his door, he takes him in and gives him a home.  And for anyone who saw ""Billy Madison"" you see the irony here.  Anyway, to make a long story short, it's the most well-rounded character he's every played.  It's a movie that anyone can like, even if they don't like Adam Sandler.  Grant it, he has the starring role, but he's with a great supporting cast.  It includes Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Rob Schneider, along with some Sandler-movie regulars.  Joey is particularly good here.  She provides more seriousness than most of his female co-stars from earlier films.
This movie is definetly a comedy--and it' a good one at that.  But it has more than just stupid laughs.  It's cute, it's sad, and it's something you shouldn't be able to hate.  The movie may be around 3.5 stars, it's better than just three.  The only reason it didn't get more is because of the ending.  I didn't think much of the ending, but I guess it was fitting.  Anyway, Adam Sandler does something in this movie that I hope continues for him; that being playing great roles.  So watch this movie, whether you like Adam Sandler or not.

One day she gets fed up up with him and tells him to grow up and get a decent job. As his girl friend left he went over to see his room mate and as he entered his house everyone wasted the suprise on Sonny. Everyone was very disapointed because they wasted it on sonny when they wanted to say it to the other room mate who was leaving to china for a few weeks. As the room mate leaves Sonny gets a kid sent to him with a note saying that it was the room mates kid. Sonny called the room mate up and told him he had his kid right here. Sonny ended up looking after him and raising him to become like him which was very funny. Later on in the movie he visits his ex girl friend and tries to impress her with his kid, though things start to go wrong as Sonny finds out she's sleeping with a old man. HOW WILL SONNY WIN HER BACK!!!!!!!!! one of the funniest parts in the movie was when Sonny had a little talk yo by the kids teacher and the teacher had some very bad things to say about the kid which where very funny. Another funny bit was when the kid goes daddy can i have my night light, and so Sonny turns on a lit up sign saying live nudes with an arrow pointing to the right. I really loved this movie, it was very hillarious with more than 20 hillarious bits. It is one of the most hillarious films i had seen and the ending was very sweet and even through out the film it was sweet.

When I tell people about this movie (guys in particular), I always tell them that this is NOT your typical Sandler comedy (ex The Water Boy, Happy Gilmore and Little Nicky).  This one has some funny parts but for the most part, it's a romantic comedy.
Sandler is Sonny Koufax, your typical guy that has the right ideas but not the drive.  After a kid gets dropped off at his apartment, he finds out that the kid is his roommates' (Jon Stewart)  Sonny than tells his roommate that he'll watch the kid until he got back from a business trip.  It's a really sweet and cute father and son movie with a comedy twist on parenting.
Now I went into this movie not knowing the story and me and my best friend saw this moving thinking that it was going to be another great Sandler comedy.  I can assure you that I was a little mad at first when half way through the movie we realized that it was a date movie.  I wasn't disappointed, but this is a perfect example for anyone who just goes and sees movies without  bothering to find out what the movie is about.
Other than that, I thought it was pretty good.  It has a good story, the cast is great and the parts that are funny are really funny.

Overall it is a very good romantic comedy movie and a must have. There are some priceless secnes in here and when has Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider ever upset us?I enjoyed this big hit and im shore you will too

However, this is probably my least favorite Adam Sandler movie for lots of reasons. Above all, it gets WAY too sappy. I mean most AS movies get sappy intentionally, but come one, the whole montage scene at the end was too much. Secondly, it strives for the kind of coolness factor ala the Kevin Smith films, Swingers, and the like. AS films were never meant to be as mentally challenging as those films, and I know I sound like the average AS fan when I say all this. However, not all is bad. There are some funny lines/scenes (all he does is eat and sleep, he's like a damn cocker spaniel) but mainly, the film fails because it tries to hard.

1241616,5,B00000K3UU,"To keep it simple, I am very sceptical about films when they are released. I never give a film a high score just because I like it, but this film is brilliant. Adam Sandler is a great comedian and screenplay writer and the whole cast fitted in nicely to the theme of the story.
I find it very hard to make any bad comment on the film. It is of such high quality that I find it is amazing. Sandler plays ""Sonny Koufax"" a thirty-two-year-old slob who intends on wasting his life with no job. He makes a living from the money he made in a cab accident and uses it for all worthless stuff. But then when his girlfriend says she's going to dump him if he doesn't grow up, he tries to sort things out by adopting a five-year-old boy (played by the adorably cute Cole and Dylan Sprouse, great actors to look out for) called Julian. Sonny's girlfriend dumps him anyway, for an older man, and Sonny finds it too hard to look after Julian. So Sonny tries to give him back to Social Services but to no avail. Just as Sonny grows close to Julian, with a very warm love, Social Services come knocking. Sonny goes to court and tries to get Julian back, but the judge will have none of that. Even though I tell you most of the story, you have to see it for yourself.
To say the least, a film well acted (Sandler does a great Sonny Koufax, and Cole and Dylan play their part even better) and well wrote. Tremendously funny and sad in parts. I remember when I first saw Big Daddy in the cinema, the response from the entire audience was breath-taking. I remember when Julian put up his hand when Sonny was crossing the road and he wanted him to hold his hand, people said ""awwww"" or ""how cute"". And then people laughed their minds off at the most funny parts of film history.

I wouldn't approve of a kid having a big neon sign in his room that says ""LIVE NUDES"", especially one at that age. I wouldn't want my kid to trip rollerbladers that go really fast. It would be funny, but I wouldn't want my kid dripping spit out of his mouth and slurping it back up. And I especially would NEVER allow him to become the smelly kid in school...that is just disgusting; every kid needs to take a bath, because even Adam Sandler himself wouldn't want to smell that kid every day, and each day, it gets worse and worse until you have to get him into a headlock to take a bath, but you're hesitant to do it because he hasn't bathed in three months and you don't want to smell yourself.

1241635,3,B00000K3UU,"It's hard not to like ""Big Daddy"", though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of  the comic actor. For although this film has raised the hackles of a number  of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive  parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged.  Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to  go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine  likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona. ""Big  Daddy"" might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily  to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan  portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden  fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.
Sandler portrays a  30-something loser living in South Manhattan, who has been milking a minor  foot injury to the tune of a $200,000 court settlement and whose life,  consequently, consists of miniscule employment, a general lack of  direction, and a girlfriend who's ready to move on to an older man with a  ""5-year plan"". When a little boy suddenly shows up on his  doorstep (the hitherto unknown son of a friend of his), Sandler decides to  temporarily take him under his wing in the hopes of winning his girlfriend  back. Thus, a man with almost no resources of adult maturity attempts to  instill skewed life lessons into a willing, highly impressionable young  mind. This leads to Sandler's teaching the boy to indulge in predictable,  but surprisingly timid, antisocial behavior such as urinating on public  buildings, staying up late, tripping unsuspecting rollerbladers etc. The  film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times, but  Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.
As Sandler grows to care  for his tot and the inevitable forces array themselves against him to take  the child away, the film veers off in the direction of sappiness and  maudlin tearjerking. One may be moved at times, but one also craves the  satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have  provided.
The movie does display an enlightened view of gays (though  Hollywood has yet to get past the point where gay characters can do more  than merely twinkle at each other), but it loses points for its rather  nasty tone towards old people. Still, any film designed to send Dr. Laura  into spasms of psychoanalytical outrage should be respected and  honored.
Overall, ""Big Daddy"" is a movie that, if it had taken  more audacious pathways, might have been a firstrate comedy. As it is, it  provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling - and that, given the  state of much of big screen comedy these days, is about all we dare allow  ourselves to expect.",964310400,,2840,4.951167728237792

1241638,2,B00000K3UU,"Eminent thinkers like John R. Searle have long considered the perplexing existence (or theoretical existence) of consciousness to be one of the great mysteries of life.  Equally perplexing a mystery is the popularity of  Adam Sandler and his abominable films, indisputable proof of the existence  of unconsciousness.  For a journey that thoroughly explores the utter pits  of refuse, feel free to watch Big Daddy, an eccentric piece about an  unmotivated slacker (Sandler) who develops a sense of responsibility while  caring for an abandoned child (Julian, played by twins Cole and Dylan  Sprouse).
Sandler plays the part of Deadbeat Big Daddy, showing the  five-year old how to, among other things, urinate in public and make bed  sheets out of old newspapers.  Most depressing is the apparent joy the film  takes out of exposing the kid to some predominantly adult situations,  including a constant barrage of tiresome Hooters jokes.  Tack on one of the  silliest (and longest) courtroom scenes ever put on celluloid, and you've  got yourself a real turkey.
That being said, Bid Daddy does have a few  clever moments.  The way Sandler tries to keep Julian away from drugs by  interrogating several of his school friends is hilarious and almost  heartwarming.  Rob Schneider and Joey Lauren Adams also turn in competent  performances.  Unfortunately, there is not nearly enough good to outweigh  the bad, so I cannot recommend this film.

1241649,5,B00000K3UU,"Now THIS is what a REAl comedy is all about! Adam Sandler plays a young man who recently graduated from law school.
Sonny (that's Adam Sandler's character's name) works at a toll booth on a high way. His girlfriend  breaks up with him because she thinks he's not responsible enough to get a  ""real job"" and act more mature.
When Sonny's roommate goes to  China, his dead wife leaves behind a little five-year-old adorable boy for  Sonny's roommate to take care of because he is the boy's natural father.  But since the boy's natural father is going away to China, Sonny tells him  that he will take care of the boy.
Of course, Sonny becomes attached to  the boy and the boy becomes attached to him. Sonny decides to adopt the boy  to prove to his girlfriend that he is responsible and mature and can do  things right so he can get her back. Even though the boy is not really  Sonny's son, he still loves and cares for him like a real father  would.
Through the laughs, there are heart-warming parts of the movie. It  is a really good movie and I think Adam Sandler did an excellent acting  job, and this movie was really hilarious! I especially love the part when  the little boy is jumping on his jumping ball and repeating everything  Sonny is saying while he's watching the hockey game. Then Sonny goes,  ""How much would could a wood chuck chuck could if a wood chuck wood  chuck would"". Then the kid stares at him like he's crazy! It cracks me  up!

It has worn thin, and so have his movies.  ""Big Daddy"" is disturbingly irresponsible.  Critics that call his  character ""a good father in his own way"" must not have seen the  movie I saw.  Adam Sandler crosses a line and does not make light of it or  even acknowledge it, whereas good comedies like ""There's Something  About Mary"" recognize that they have crossed the line, but set the  tone correctly as to make the audience feel good about laughing.  Laughing  at ""Big Daddy"" just doesn't feel right.  To see a movie that  finds humor in the more disturbing things in life, rent  ""Happiness"".

1241688,4,B00000K3UU,"The film was thoroughly entertaining and the special features that are also available on the DVD were OK.
I found ""Big Daddy"" an enjoyable comedy and I liked the way that the script was written with some  very clever one-liners.  If I am able to laugh out loud at a film, when I  am meant to I consider it a success.  The main characters that appealed  were Sonny and the tramp that kept appearing at all the right moments.  Adam Sandler is a very clever comedy actor who has a subtle approach and  does the job just right.
The children in the film are not too sickeningly  sweet and do not steal the film away from the more talented actors.  Julian  is a very likeable character and ""ahh"" was quite often used when  watching.
After the film there is the option of ""HBO's special on  the making"" and this deserves a completely different review and all I  can say is what patience both Adam Sandler and Rob Schnieder had with two  such hyperactive children.",954720000,,956,4.419540229885057

And I never  thought I'd live to see the day when a famous Hollywood actor would say he  supported gay marriages. That was VERY mature of him and I was pleasently  surprised.

The plot was okay, but the language and the content was  disgusting.  You must have a strong stomach to watch this movie.  There was  no real comedy.

The different role that I'm talking about is his character having to take care of a little kid. In Billy Madison  he was acting like a little kid,In the Waterboy his character was being  watched over by his mom. But,in this movie he had to take care of his 'son'  and when he has his son taken away he is upset. It proves that Adam can play  a character that isn't only funny. I think that this movie is great!

*Rob Schneider and Jon Stewart,though secondary,are very funny.
*The kid was cute and convincing.
Cons:
*Very dramatic ending. If it were funny,it would've been better.
*The jokes aren't  much.
Bottomline:When I heard that it was a comedy that grossed about  150-60 million dollars,I thought that it could be just as funny as Kingpin  or Dumb&Dumber. If you're an Adam Sandler fan,it's good.

The characters are the most Stereotyped People ever put on  film. (eg. Adams Gay friends, The foreign delivery boy) This could be  forgiven if they were funny, but they simply arn't.

I was surprised - It was very good!  Adam Sandler adopts a  5-year-old boy to prove to his girlfriend he's ready for the next stage of  his life.  She dumps him anyway, and Sandler realizes that he doesn't know  what he's doing, and so tries to give the kid back.  While he's got him,  though, they do all sorts of crazy things and have a lot of fun.  Rob  Schneider provides excellent comic relief, as does Steve Buscemi, who has a  cameo in this film.  In short, a normally irresponsible man grows up by  having to deal with the joys of parenthood.  A thumbs-up for heart, and two  thumbs up for humor and entertainment!

1241729,4,B00000K3UU,"I must admit; I was shocked.  My first thoughts were that this movie was going to be one of those formatted films that puts a kid in just for ratings; or one in which the attempt to be humorous is there but the actual humor lacks.  I never really have watched Adam long enough to compliment or  insult his acting; so in this film I made sure I was glued to my seat; it  was long after that in which I realized I was actually enjoying this film.  The fact that Adam is actually holding himself back from life, and this kid  makes him understand that the life he is living is not making him happy or  satisfying him.  It takes a 5 year old kid to get a 30-something year old  man to realize the truth about his own presence in his own little world,  kids; miracle workers huh! The end surprised me totally and I even cried!  When a movie can actually touch you so much that you feel the emotions and  you begin to express them; it's a film worth as many compliments as one can  give.  It's not just another comedy; for once Adam did a film in which his  true acting capabilities began to show.  You're a funny guy Adam, but more  important than that; it took this movie to get me to see; you're a hell of  an actor.",944179200,3,1213,4.089361702127659

However, in all fairness, the average person probably would not get a ""big"" kick out of this film....possibly some  youngsters will.  However,  Adam's character just seemed a little too calm  and not as excitable as many of the other roles he has become so well known  for.  To me Joey Lauren Adams stole the show.  She's a very pretty lady and  draws everyones attention when she's on the screen.  If you like her be  sure to check out a movie called S.F.W. she has a small but memorable  (partial nude scene) role in that film.",944006400,,619,4.333333333333333
