8619720,5,B00FZEHF4K,"I have been collecting some Vocaloid concert Blu-rays over time (not ALL of them mind you; I've mostly only gotten the Mikupa/Miku Live Party Blu-rays up 'til now, with the exception of Mikunopolis), but even though there are no live musicians here, and the dance animation quality is a litle janky every now and again (more-so for certain characters, but more on that later), I think this is my FAVORITE concert so far! This is a very unique concert; taking place for a small crowd of about 200 people in August of 2013, this production astounds with excellent song variety and stage effects.
As far as song variety goes, this concert excels. Normally, the concerts only seem to use songs from the Project DIVA game series, which is fine, but it leaves a lot to be desired as the same songs get performed over and over again. This concert blends familiar songs like ""Deep Sea Girl"", ""Senbonzakura"" and ""Tell Your World"" with some obscure songs that I'd never even heard of before this concert, and I don't think they were ever played live at any another concert: ""Sugar Bits"", ""Chaining Intention"", ""Crescent Moon Rider"", ""SWEET MEMORIES"" (which has an English section sung by Miku) ""Mad Lovers"", featuring Megurine Luka (in her only song, unfortunately), and ""Orange Intersection"", the powerful yet sweet ending credits song. The obscure songs are the best in the lineup because they are unique to this concert, and they are a breath of fresh air compared to the other songs which we've all heard a dozen times. Not to mention, some of the songs feature new tuning to Miku's voice, or an alternative music track backing Miku's vocals, which keeps even the ""Miku Mainstays"" fresh and interesting.
While the music is what your ears will be transfixed with, let's talk a bit about the eye candy in this concert. As far as I am aware (from experience watching these), compared to other concerts, this one does the most with background/foreground stage effects and character interaction. There is almost always something going on besides having the characters dance. The back screen often makes use of character close-ups, which offer a closer look, and sometimes an alternative view, to the main character's performance. During ""Deep Sea Girl"", an entire underwater set was created and projected in the background, with bubbles floating around MIku (she also makes bubbles of her own everytime she moves). ""Chaining Intention"" makes use of some electrifying and abstract effects, creating clones of Miku dancing in a line, and syncing them up together to the rhythm. Luka makes her appearance in a spinning chair, magically appearing during one of it's rotations. During the credits song, a moonlit bedroom is projected on the screen, which gives off a calm, and sort of nostalgic feeling that pairs perfectly with the acoustic guitar in ""Orange Intersection"". The best performance of the whole thing, in my opinion, is for the song ""Tsuki Kage Mai Ka"", an upbeat and catchy song with a somewhat traditional Japanese sound, where Miku is dressed in a kimono wih a large umbrella. Her long sleeves sway gracefully during the dance while Japanese lanterns, rows of bamboo, and large paint splatters are projected in the background, and there's a nice use of the stage lights that enhance certain moments.
Speaking of Miku, let's talk about the character models used in the concert. These are not the Project DIVA Arcade models, nor the generic ones used in the Magical Mirai events. These are known to fans as the ""Appearance"" models. They have adorable anime-style faces, which emote really well. Luka has highlights in her hair, and wears a revealing outfit with a more muscular-looking build than usual, making her stand out among the female Vocaloids; Rin and Len match each other perfectly, as they should, but Luka and the twins only get to sing one song each. Kaito is... just OK. He's only in one song, but he doesn't emote very well (also, his trenchcoat glitches out near the bottom and jitters a lot during his performance). Miku, on the other hand, is the main star of the concert, so not only does she emote well with her large thoughtful eyes, but her hair and clothing physics are solid (mostly), and she gets four different costumes to wear in addition to her regular attire. There are a couple times where her arms clip through her hair, but this was probably done to avoid her hair from spazzing out on stage.
To add extra value, this set also includes a gorgeous slipcase with watercolor style artwork on it, and a ""making-of"" DVD (this is locked to Region 2, so you'll need a region free player to watch this). Clocking in at about 20 songs (including the opening and ending songs) this is a fantastic concert with amazing production values that you'll want to watch over and over again! And at the time of writing this, you can find a copy here for about $30 or less. Obviously I haven't covered everything in the concert, so there will be some nice surprises when you sit down and watch. I highly recommend this concert to all Vocaloid fans; it's a unique experience you won't soon forget! Get the Blu-ray for the best experience, the picture quality is really good, and you won't miss a single detail.",1505433600,,5220,4.827008928571429
8619721,5,B00FZEHF4K,"This one is pretty cool because the animation on the characters is different than that of most concerts. Hatsune and all her friends are drawn cuter than normal and have almost a more natural look to them. In fact, I would say this is what they should look like all the time. This ""concert"" is live and seem to be a private party of about 200 people or so. Glow sticks and cheering accompany very awesome animations on screen. Can you imagine getting Hatsune Miku for your party? This guy is my hero.
 Not the best selection of songs (more Project Diva 2 style) but at least you get variety instead of her most popular songs which you should just buy ""the Kansai"" concert (which is the best).
But for those of us that have that blu-ray already and want more, this is a good one.",1433980800,2,778,4.328767123287672
