4207674,5,B003UV93M2,Ashland area in Oregon could be considered as one of the most beautiful places covered by other great movies like this one.

4207676,3,B003UV93M2,"The video is very nice but didn't show most of Ashland.  It kept showing the same area/park over and over again.  I would have gone a bit further.  Perhaps, made it a little more personal.  A little more inviting.  However, I like the personal touch of the autographed pic from the producer!

Good luck to you.",1294790400,,310,4.446428571428571

I have bought a few more to send to family. I really enjoyed it and highly reccommend it!!!",1279065600,2,256,4.354166666666667
4207678,1,B003UV93M2,"I bought 3 of these to give out at our family reunion, give folks out east a taste of 'back home'. Not only were the movies tacky and tourist-driven (i.e. didn't give a feeling of the town at all) but production values were HORRIBLE. Entire film seemed an amateur affair. Will not be making the mistake of buying from this line ever again.",1279065600,,339,4.396825396825397
4207679,5,B003UV93M2,"i've seen many movies related to traveling, and this one is indeed among good ones. the content is absolutely descriptive, so is the narration. the video has captured beautiful footage of the place and nature. i loved it, and you would too.",1305763200,,240,4.738095238095238

8406187,1,B003UV93M2,"It became evident half way through this video, the producer was more interested in bouncing boobies than the town.",1452988800,,114,5.052631578947368
8406188,1,B003UV93M2,"Only rented this from Amazon for $1.99 but really don't think it was worth that!  Bad quality. Narration was not good. Kept showing the same footage over and over again.  Bad, loud music throughout.  Actually, didn't learn anything that we didn't already know about Ashland from doing research online.  Still looking for a good guide to Ashland!",1428278400,,345,5.0

8406190,1,B003UV93M2,"Dont be deceived by the positive reviews. I was. Everything about this product has ""amateur"" written all over it: the filming (shots out of focus), the script (references to beautiful nature), and the production (the same shots used repeatedly throughout), even the packaging (the first claim to fame of the producers is that they're college graduates). Unfortunately, this is a high school product, at best. If you want to get a visual feel for Ashland, youd be better off doing a Google images search.",1390003200,,503,5.0
8406191,3,B003UV93M2,"I would say that the pictures need some help, brighter, it seems that all photos, video were kind of dull looking, dry I should say, need to emphasize more color, make it more colorful.
I want to move to Ashland and it did help some to show me around but I will need to come visit for a better look.
Thanks for your effort in putting the video together, helped me",1374883200,,363,4.126760563380282
8406192,3,B003UV93M2,"The good news is:  if you are specifically desiring information and a decent tour of Ashland, Oregon then you will probably enjoy this 25-minute travel DVD.

The bad news is that compared to the scads of high quality travel DVDs we have enjoyed, this DVD is not in high definition which speaks volumes about the quality of the cinematography. Too bad because there are numerous scenes that would have been just beautiful if their colors were vivid instead of washed out looking.  Yes, there are some scenes that are shown more than once and also some scenes did not match the narration but those errors could be overlooked if there were other qualities to ooooohhh and awwwwwwww about.  The narrator did a descent job of narrating but the background music would have been better left out.

I bought this Ashland, Oregon DVD as a gift for my son because he is thinking about relocating to Oregon within in the next couple of years.  He thought it was a good overview of Ashland but agreed with my cinematography and background music  comments.",1370736000,,1042,4.723756906077348
8406193,2,B003UV93M2,"I really wanted to like this, but there are just too many faults. The video looks very much like something someone would make as a high school project. The script has some jarring grammatical errors and the narration doesn't match up with the scenes much of the time (e.g. talking about wildlife while showing video of cows). Plus, the same shots are shown over and over (deer, ducks, etc.). All that being said, if you want a video about Ashland this is the one to get since I don't think there are any others. It's a beautiful town that needs a professional video that does it justice.",1319587200,,587,4.4953271028037385
8406194,5,B003UV93M2,"Great footage of Ashland. I want to visit Southern Oregon, it's such beautiful footage. The narration was really good. This is a great travel video!",1305849600,,148,4.96
8406195,5,B003UV93M2,"Loved it a lot! Was just what I was looking for. The narration wasn't boring like in some travel dvd's I've seen, and the video shots done were amazingly vivid and enchanting. Gave me some great tips on where I'll be heading to in my next vacation.",1305849600,,248,4.297872340425532
