I have had the VHS version and hadn't been using, knowing that I needed a DVD.
You made my dream come true ! Now I can continue enjoying Al Di Meola

Thanks !",1390780800,,218,3.9545454545454546
7831472,5,6302798655,"I grew up listening to Al, he gives some real chop busting stuff and explains it well.  This is another winner in my book.",1378252800,,122,4.083333333333333
7831473,3,6302798655,"I caught this DVD on sale.  It is a great instructional disc for those wanting to learn some of Al's guitar techniques and probably only average over all for those who appreciate the music of this great guitarist.  If you're predominantly interested in Al's music, there are other DVD's that are more worth your attention and money.",1356220800,,332,4.807017543859649
7831474,2,6302798655,I am a huge fan of Al Di Meola. I really liked  his book on chords and arpeggios. This video however was a huge let down. It felt less like instructional and more like a video of Al soloing with brief talking in between.,1239321600,2,220,4.0
7831475,5,6302798655,To sit and learn guitar from books and CDs is great but to have Al Di Meola give you a personal lesson on his playing style is as good as it gets! The DVD was shipped in record time and in great condition! It comes with a small music book (in tablature format for those that cannot read standard music notes)that disects what he does in the DVD. The lessons are absolutely excellent and if you are a di hard Al Di Meola fan you are going to want this DVD! I had been searching everywhere for it and was told that it was not likely I would ever find it in anything but VHS. The lessons are short but plenty of techniques to keep you busy for months! The live cuts of his playing are also dynamite and he even performs a couple of pieces of his music for you.  Absoluetly the best DVD for beginners and advance players (who love his music)!,1209945600,8,838,4.109756097560975
7831476,5,6302798655,I do not have a lot of guitar instructional videos so I don't have a lot to compare it to. I DO have John McLaughlin's new DVD set and I have to say that I think I like Di Meola's better simply because its seems so much more concise. It helped my technique a lot just to see what he was doing. He goes over improv most of the time and hes able to fit a lot onto one DVD as opposed to McLaughlin's 3 DVD set and for only a fourth of the price. I just don't seem to have time for McLaughlin's stuff. I found this on DVD for $35 at a local music store and am very happy with the purchase. The performances are also great to see.,1149897600,,625,3.7786259541984735
7831477,5,6302798655,Having bought the video... without hesitation I was hoping for the same on DVD but am happy to have it on VHS.,1036886400,,110,4.045454545454546
7831478,4,6302798655,"Filled with snippets of Mr. Di Meola playing guitar with his 'World Sinfonia' band, while also focusing primarily on his incredible technique, this video is ideal for both musicians who would like to know and play as Al does, as well as entertain any fan who is amazed by both his techniqual and composition skills. This video is a little old, about 10 years or so, and while the music is at least as old, it still is worth checking out. I feel that the 40 or so dollar price range is a little unacceptable, considering not only that the tape is rather old, but that the tape only comes with a 20+ page paperbacked booklet which only focuses mostly on solos. Still, though, it's the only instructional video that Mr. Di Meola has made so far, and you aren't going to find much better, as far as instructional videos from incredibly talented musicians go. I would recommend this product to either intermediate to advanced musicians, as Al's technique and mastery of the instrument far surpasses anything that a beginning guitarist could comprehend, and therefore I wouldn't recommend that a 'newbie' attempt to play these impossibly fast solos (although it is good for practice when slowed down!).",1030320000,4,1196,4.782608695652174
7831479,5,6302798655,"This is a great video for guitar instruction. Version 1 from Al.
Anyway this is a great video for all those which enjoy Al's style. Please pay the price it is worth it in the long run.
Good luck.",995068800,2,195,4.0256410256410255
