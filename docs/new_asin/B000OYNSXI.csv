8187726,5,B000OYNSXI,"This movie is in Mandarin (Chinese) with no subtitles unfortunately. However it is a classic movie from maybe 20 years ago. The story line is the typical Japanese arts vs the Japanese arts and the movie does justice to both. For the Chinese side the featured arts are Tai Chi, Ba Gua and some Xing Yi, the classical three main Internal martial arts. The techniques from my martial arts perspective (I have done martial arts since the 1960's including Chinese martial arts and Karate) are fairly good. The star of the movie is probably some kind of Wu Shu champion and not just an actress who learned a few movements to simulate fighting. The techniques are are good, with none of the flying around stuff or Chi lighting bolts coming out of the experts hands. Just plan good Wu Shu techniques. For the martial artist who has studied some Chinese martial arts, this is a good movie. But for the non-martial artist who is wanting to compare this to a Bruce Lee movie or a Tony Jaa movie, they may be disappointed. For me I give it 5 stars. Of course in the Chinese movie the Chinese win but these movies still give plenty of credit to the Japanese as they show the Japanese arts are very hard to beat since it takes the top in Chinese martial arts to beat them. For me I don't care who beats who but enjoy to watch the artistic display of Asian martial arts. It is rare to showcase the Tai Chi, Ba Gua and Xing Yi arts in combat. These are not garbage arts but it is hard to find good teachers of these arts. Martial arts is not about punching people in the face or seeing who can beat who in an MMA fight. A true martial artist no matter what kind is someone who is dedicated to putting in the art work to showcase his or her art. Of course some of the top people are happy to just train all their life, showing their art to nobody. So anyway a good Chinese martial arts movie that can be labelled as a classic for sure.",1485043200,,1918,4.257534246575342
8187727,3,B000OYNSXI,I think I was miss informed. Somebody told me this was a Bagua movie. Maybe I don't really know what Bagua is because I have not seen anything like what I think Bagua is.,1422144000,,170,4.029411764705882
8187728,5,B000OYNSXI,"The action sequences here (fights) are some of the best I have ever seen of northern styles. Yes, there are a few trampolines but the choreography is superb and there is just about every weapon as well. DVD transfer is dubbed and transfer is very dark but this is a great movie.",1402012800,,278,4.365384615384615
8187729,4,B000OYNSXI,"The video transfer here is 1.66:1 so it just about fills the 4:3 screen with only slight letter boxed bars at top.

I owned the VHS version for years and hoped to replace it.  The image transfer is pristine, and for those of us who are die-hard Wu Dang fans a must have...despite the one major serious flaw:
While the menu itself is all in english, there NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES (or any other subtitles for that matter - not even chinese characters!)

I'm debating whether to return it as it cost $15 from Amazon.  But, the dialog is crystal clear (both the pcm 2.0 track and the 5.1 DD track).  So, even with my limited mandarin, I can make out most of the sentences.

But if you speak no mandarin, and ""watching"" a movie without understanding what's going on is not your thing, you'll want to skip this version direct from China.",1220572800,5,828,4.4144736842105265
8187730,4,B000OYNSXI,"i personally think this is one of the best kung fu flix there ever was! realize when saying that though everyone has particular interest/likes/dislikes ect.. BUT EVERY actor in this film was Very skilled in martial arts and most of the boughts were hard to tell between choreographed and the real thing at times....
  The tie-in to Wu Dang (Wu Tang) was relative and accurate as well and just an overall enjoyable film to watch more than once. Personally I think martial arts fans wouldnt be dissapointed in adding this one to their venue at all. Zhao Chang Jun is/was truly and incredible artist of whom I hope to find more movies of as well.
