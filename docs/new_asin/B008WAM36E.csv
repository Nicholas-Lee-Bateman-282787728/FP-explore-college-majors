5186918,5,B008WAM36E,"I got the pack for around $26 with shipping. It's well worth it, I looked at a local retailer and its $99.99 so....I can't complain. Basically every episode is about each superbowl and the history of that year. It's pretty cool, and my finace is fine with watching it b/c its not like watching a full game its a long story with a game. So that's a plus.

However, there is not a full lenght game in the bunch. It is only a narrator telling you what football is and decribing what they call ""highlites"" of the games...believe me it was a total disappointment. If you want to see the actual bowl games, you won't see them on this set...you will, however, see some old film clips of interviews with fans and the famous personallities of the time.",1168300800,14,564,4.485436893203883

If you are a football fan of anytype i suggest getting this collection it shows everthing in these highlights you would see on espn plus more.

5187045,5,B008WAM36E,"I already had 30-39, so this was a perfect purchase. What is in here? A season highlight reel, plus the 22 minute Superbowl Highlight reel. The season highlights aren't as great for the first 15 or so, 1965-1980 something. Starting sometime in the 80's, the highlight reel for the season became ""ROAD TO THE SUPERBOWL"", which is the crowning achievement of NFL films highlights each season. It always airs the day of the Superbowl, it gives the story of the season, focusing on all the playoff teams, and their elimination, until you are left with 2.  Its 45 minutes long, an hour of commercial TV, just like all half hour shows are 22 minutes long commercial free.  From around Superbowl XVI it really gets good, mid to late 80's, really good footage, hard hits, great plays by those historically great players.  Superbowl highlights are as good as the Superbowls, but even the blowouts NFL films finds a way to make it compelling. The really great superbowls demand further viewing of course, if its your team you should purchase the broadcasts.

  Occasionally there's some great teaching. Don Shula narrated 1973 Dolphin highlight reel, how crossblocking overcame the Hall of Fame defensive line of the Vikings. I love that episode, even though the game was a blowout and repeat of the Dolphins.  The thing about Road to Superbowl and Superbowl Highlights: You only watch the greats, the playoff teams, division champs. So the Raiders, Steelers, Dolphins, Cowboys, take up much of V-XV footage. Which is great, just great!
  If you're big on NFL History, you need this.  But you also need XXX-XL, and those productions are slicker, cleaner, and better. Great Superbowls, like 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004.  Im a giant fan, so XXV highlight reel is my favorite, Ive seen it a dozen times probably. I tape recorded it off the TV as a kid and watched it until the VCR ate the tape.
 ALL of this was previously aired, Road to Superbowl day of the Superbowl, and the highlight reel aired the next week on NFL Films Presents.
 Back when NFL films did 'Game of the Week' NFL films is just all around awesome. I loved it my whole life, Id eagerly look to when Road to Superbowl aired.  It used to be close to the game, part of the pre-game coverage. But the last few years,  Its usually around 11am, so DVR it. Remember that, because set XL to L is going to take a few years. Im buying it as soon as its released.",1436572800,,2403,4.621176470588235

I wouldn't have bought it had I read the Reviews,  so that ones on me. In my excitement didn't research the reviews. Richard said it best as follows...

I purchased NFL Super Bowl Collection thinking it was a play by play recording of each Superbowl. What I received was a very well produced NFL Films RECAP of each Superbowl. While there was nothing wrong with the production, I am simply very disappointed with what I received.

5187147,5,B008WAM36E,"What is great when reading these reviews is people emphasize what isn't in the set or what it is not the  set which you see as low ratings.

What do you get when you are purchasing when you buy this set? You are buying a time capsule of the NFL in the Super Bowl era. If you love football or know someone who loves football, this is a must have. This is where generations of fans can sit back and watch highlights from all eras. The best part is you get more than the Super Bowl highlights, you get for the first 45 Road to the Super Bowls where you get a program that shows the absolute best from the regular season and how the participants got to the Super Bowl.

So what you get is highlights of men from Johnny Unitas, Vince Lombardi, Walter Payton, O.J. Simpson, Barry Sanders and so many more. So again you can truly bridge generations with this set. For those who love football you get to watch some of football's all time greatest do the absolute best...for example I watched the Road to the Super Bowl in 1994 the Barry Sanders run vs. the Patriots you see the art of Barry running, the eyes bright, the legs chopping. So awesome.

Now obviously you are not buying the set for the Season in Reviews/Road to the Super Bowls, you are buying this set for the Super Bowl highlights....essentially in your home whenever you buy this product it is Super Bowl highlight marathon in your house when you want them. The famous films all of us football diehards love.

For that and that alone is 5-star worthy. Now the package is elegant, the discs are really easy to remove and put in you get on each disc 2 Super Bowls and 2 Season in Reviews/Road to the Super Bowls (except for the 2011 season). The Bonus Feature for the entire set is the NFL Network's Top 10 episode ranking the Super Bowls which in itself is a great show and can lead to debate you get a wonderful package and a great set.

Now what I don't like about the set:
*they released this set 4 Super Bowls away from Super Bowl 50 (again no Roman Numeral), I have purchased the James Bond collection and the MLB World Series Collection and what was really nice about those sets that the Super Bowl Collection didn't incorporate was extra sleeves if you buy the Super Bowl Highlight discs. Which would have been nice.

*If you bought the 10 year sets they released 10 years ago almost they released I-X and XI-XX and XXI-XXX and XXXI-XL they had some really awesome bonus features that are not in this set. Grant you I don't want the same materials on this set what would have been a really cool twist been incorporate the NFL Films Highlight videos of the team that won the Super Bowl. Example would be 1979 Steelers you would have in the Super Bowl XIV area to watch the Super Bowl highlight, Season in Review Highlight and you have the option of watching the 20 minute season highlights for the Super Bowl champion which would be the Steelers.

Overall, this is a set football diehards will love, understand this is the great highlight films, if you buy this thinking these are full games, you will not like this.",1403395200,14,3078,4.387719298245614

5187303,3,B008WAM36E,"I too had problems with the glue holding together the packaging.

But by far, my biggest pet peeve was with some of the ""Road to the Super Bowl"" episodes.  In their original format, these are excellent, Emmy-worthy documentaries that hold your attention and capture your imagination.  However, for some unknown reason, the gripping, dynamic, original music that was used for several seasons has been largely replaced with cold, generic, unimpassioned filler. This occurred for the episodes for Super Bowls 22-24, and possibly more, as I haven't watched all the episodes yet.

Everyone knows that a big part of NFL Films' magic is the musical score.  As if they can just replace the award-winning music of Sam Spence with any old music selection and have you feel the same effect!

The song ""Road to the Super Bowl"" by Richie Havens is still featured in the segment about Super Bowl 22, but that is about the only original piece on that episode.

I have to think this was a problem with the copyrights of the songs.  I would hate to think someone at NFL Films actually changed the songs voluntarily.  Why tamper with something that's perfect the first time around?  I have seen old episodes of ""Road to the Super Bowl"" in recent years on ESPN, and the original music is in place.

If not for this problem, I would have given this DVD set 5 stars, hands down.",1336435200,2,1357,4.6835443037974684

8531484,5,B008WAM36E,"Excellent!! Seeing the old NFL Films presentations of the Superbowl from the very first brought so many great and sometumes sad (when my chosen team didn't win) memories!! And it was wonderful to hear the great John Facenda again!! The bonus year in review shows with Harry Callus narration were for me an unexpected but very pleasant surprise!! Again, great memories!! Seeing the football players I grew up with back in action, and seeing the game played like it used to be was very gratifying!! It's why I bought the set!! I'm very pleased!!",1496707200,,543,4.787234042553192
8531485,5,B008WAM36E,Great product!  I don't want to be mean but those who complained about it just being the highlights only have themselves to blame.  The runtime is listed here.  This is the perfect super bowl collection.  I enjoy watching the 30 minute highlights on NFL Network every year before the super bowl.  Now I own it! So happy!,1485993600,,320,4.543859649122807

8531491,5,B008WAM36E,"Oh wah wah. So many of you complaining that it misleads you to believing it has full games, when if you read the item description, it's pretty clear that's not the case... Great piece of NFL Films. The season in reviews are phenomenal and you can't get them anywhere else... Someone said u can watch them on youtube. Thats bs. Read the description next time before you buy",1462838400,2,372,4.485294117647059
