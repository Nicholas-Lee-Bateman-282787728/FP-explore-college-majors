8134122,3,B000GRUVU6,"Jean Jacques Machado is a Brazilian jiu jitsu specialist who happened to be born with one malformed hand.  Despite this, he has -- through sheer force of will -- become one of THE leading practitioners of this martial art.  If this was all, there would likely be no documentary made of him.  Yet, he has become a teacher, author and exemplar of what people can do by sheer determination and hard work.

For a compelling profile of a modern-day ""master"" of his craft, ""The Force of the Spirit"" is an inspiring tale that can help all of us overcome limitations and break throgh barriers.",1225497600,,585,4.596153846153846
8134123,5,B000GRUVU6,"Outstanding documentary. Fine job of balancing the man's story with the art of his fighting technique. Definitely worth your time if you are interested in grappling/jiu-jitsu.

I've seen a few other videos/DVDs on this subject matter and got nothing out of them; they are far inferior. On the other hand, this one inspires and motivates and is done well. How Machado is able to do the things he does is amazing given his ""disadvantage."" This video sheds light on this and makes you wonder why can't the rest of us perform as well given our lack of such a ""disadvantage"".

Good stuff about a good guy!",1157414400,2,600,4.650943396226415
