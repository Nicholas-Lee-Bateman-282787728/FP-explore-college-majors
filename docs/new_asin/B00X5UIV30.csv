7158891,5,B00X5UIV30,"I just received this as a gift and plan on picking up some more in this series.  For around $15, you get the Blu-ray/DVD combo, a hardcover copy of the graphic novel, a digital copy of the movie AND a digital copy of the book from Comixology.  If you bought this all separately, it would be over $40.  For someone new to comics, this would be a great gift for them.  DC, if you read this, please do more!",1441497600,3,404,4.075949367088608

7158893,5,B00X5UIV30,"This year ive been getting into comics. Ive read all of the justice league new 52 comics and ive started buying them since issue #40 along others as well. I got sucked it (-:

Anyways ive been meaning to buy this movie, and i cant find the bluray+dvd+digital download copies in stores anymore, until i stumbled upon this last month(i preordered it as soon as i knew this item was legit). Its great for those who are new to comics and also want to own the movies. So like me.
Im happy because now i own the movie bundle ive been wanting, PLUS the graphic novel that I probably would have never bought on its own.
Since ive read these issues online, its so great having a physical copy of the comics. The illustrations are amazing irl.

This review is probably all over the place but what i'm trying to say is that this is an amazing set, at an amazing price.

P.S. i read that theres going to be a box set that includes all of the movie+graphic novel bundles that are out right now. So if you can't decide which one to pick but don't own any of them, maybe wait for the box set? Its coming out in September i think.",1439856000,3,1114,4.196261682242991

8715111,5,B00X5UIV30,"In one product you get the hard-cover graphic novel, digital copy of the movie, DVD, and Blu-ray! I love that it comes with the graphic novel. I've watched most of the new cartoon movies, but didn't know where to find the comics that went with the story line. This presents it all as one great product!",1487030400,,302,4.410714285714286
8715112,5,B00X5UIV30,"Awesome Value with this combo pack. This combination combines the first volume of the New 52 Justice League run as well as the animated movie Justice League: War that is directly based on said volume. The New 52 JL opening saw the invasion of Earth by Darkseid's parademons. Due to the reboot/relaunch nature of the New 52 it also serves as a new origin story for the JL as they all end up meeting each other for the first time during this invasion. JL War is a fun animated movie that does the first volume storyline justice. The combo pack includes both a DVD and a Blu-Ray of the movie. Oddly enough, JL War replaced Aquaman's role with Shazam. Overall, a great starting point for DC newcomers though hardcore fans may not enjoy it as much simply due to the controversial nature of New 52 throwing out old DC continuity.",1476489600,,823,4.493333333333333

8715114,5,B00X5UIV30,"After the package arrived - upon opening the envelope that I had purchased this DVD already and it is one of my favorite movies. This will make a great gift for one of my nieces or nephews, the hardback comic is a great read along with the movies - the entire package is a buy. THANKS GERRY",1464912000,,290,4.105263157894737
8715115,5,B00X5UIV30,"What a good deal.  Love the Graphic Novel.  This is the way the JL should be.  Now DC is having yet another reboot this May (16).  But this is still a great looking story.  Plus a Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy for one low price?  Loving them all.",1464134400,,247,4.041666666666667
8715116,5,B00X5UIV30,This was an awesome adaptation of a great story that kicked off DC Comics' New 52 Justice League series. The comic was written by superstar Geoff Johns and drawn by legendary artist Jim Lee. Amazing talent level. All of that way translated to the movie with great care to make an awesome flick. The book and blu Ray combo set is amazing as you get an awesome deal. I love and have bought all of these DC Comics combo sets. You won't be disappointed.,1463443200,,449,4.357142857142857

8715118,4,B00X5UIV30,"Fantastic marketing decision. Excellent graphic novel, great adaptation, and digital copies of both mediums. Highly recommend!

Geoff Johns knows these characters better than anyone working right now, and Jim Lee's art is stellar.  Paired together, this origin story is solid.  The movie is a faithful translation, with only a few tweaks.

The combo is a bargain! Kudos, DC.",1459468800,,374,5.396551724137931
