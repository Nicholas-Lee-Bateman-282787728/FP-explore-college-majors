7872616,5,6304475276,"having had an interest in Japanese art since childhood, this tape is a true treasure. It depicts several ""living treasures"" of Japan, artists and craftsmen/women. From making a chawan (vessel for  Chado- tea ceremony) to the fabrication of Indigo fabric colour, every picture is informative and breath taking. The scenes are rare and give a glimpse into a world very few have seen and even fever understand.",1256169600,,407,5.074626865671642

7872618,5,6304475276,"Recently, I showed this video to my 6th grade world cultures students and they were really captivated by it.  I wasn't sure how they would like it, but they loved seeing the crafts and various artists of Japan.  The video is great, because it gives you short pictures of different important people and a real overview of all of Japan's amazing talent.  My students particularly liked the fighting puppets.
It was a BIG hit.  I would definitely recommend it.  We are watching it again next year without a doubt.",1054080000,3,510,4.685393258426966
