5179184,3,B008RA61TO,Would like to know when the series comes out on Amazon?  It has interested me so I would like to see more of it,1358467200,,111,3.625
5179185,4,B008RA61TO,"Matthew Macfayden left the very successful UK tv series called MI5 in the USA and SPOOKS in the UK.  He was the lead spy and he did a splendid job.  He left it to move into movies with his most notable role being Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE with Keira Knightly. But his movie career didn't really take off so now he's back on tv, which might be his best medium.

He is the lead in this series about police work in London AFTER Jack the Ripper. Right off the bat you notice how primitive everything is in policing. He has to find his own coroner and he can't even pay him.  He basically knows the goods on him though so can keep quiet about his past in order to use his services for free.  However, he can set up a mortuary for him. Again, this is all super primitive but this is how it all started, the forensics of policing. This coroner is the next most interesting character in the series.

The cases are interesting, the first one being a copycat for Jack the Ripper and a second involving an orphan who is accused of murder. I think this series just needs time to develop itself.  It is very promising.

5179200,4,B008RA61TO,"As an American of advancing age I have a fondness for the higher level acting/story telling that the BBC is capable of. I also enjoy the various accents in the UK and really its history especially the Tudor and Victorian periods. That said, I have a better understanding of it because I also read extensively (both from the Internet and the ancient method known as book-reading). And who doesn't love a good Ripper bit!?

I do not watch television. Absolutely despise commercials and have no patience for recording plus the DVD's can be watched over and over. Since the series can be replayed in little bits or great big chunks, I tend to buy into a series that has already proved itself by going past the ever-so-risky third season. This is the make or break time for the production as the money dries up when it is deemed a poor investment.

That makes the DVD a bargain. If your television set/computer allows for screen type, you can tell what the actors are saying even though they might be mumbling or saying something that is peculiar to the natives of the country depicted. And you can just play the scene over and over till you get it.

BTW, I would LOVE to know what ""skillet"" is! This from the episode on something that is killing a large number of poor and rich citizens which may or may not be a much feared plague such as cholera. The actor describes it as a simple flour and water concoction consumed by impoverished White Chapel folks. If he's trying to say that the evil product, white flour, is responsible (a twentieth century criticism), I have to call a flag on the play. White flour would be much more expensive than the unprocessed product and quite outside of the budget limitations of his precinct.

If they're trying to pin it on refined white flour, it would be much more difficult for the ergotism organism responsible to grow in something so bereft of nutrients. Hey, even bugs gotta eat! Barley, rye and wheat that was far less refined would be a great deal more likely as a vessel for contamination since it still has a certain amount of oil that can go rancid. This would make a much more likely vehicle for organisms. BUT, then they wouldn't get to prance and postulate on how horrible businesses and upper class people were in their concern or lack there of for the poor, another liberal trope.

In other words, let's just drop the preachiness. It's annoying and boring. If I feel the need for castor oil on a nightly basis, I can just fetch a bottle and get on with my life! Still, there's not too much for me to continue watching.

Favorites: Detective Sergeant Bennet Drake (manly but modest),

Hobbs (shame on them for sacrificing a great character for cheap weeping),

Homer Jackson/Matthew Judge (the episode where he cannot figure out what a medicine is so he simply downs it and begins dancing about the station, laughing uproariously while at the same time swinging a gun wildly is a treat.)

Long Susan (the madam of the whore house who manages to sound tough as nails and vulnerable as morning dew),

Rosie (one of Susan's ""girls"" who makes no apologies for her work),

Emily (the complex, suffering wife of the chief of detectives),

Miss Goren (the generous Jewess taking in White Chapel orphans)

and lastly, Edmund Reid (the preacher-in-chief).

I realize it will annoy a lot of Matthew McFayden fans but I really don't get much feeling from his very down-played character. When he's not making snarky remarks about the upper class people, he's shouting at everyone in a five mile radius. If he's sensitive about hypocrisy, he might try beating up suspects himself rather than blithely ordering his assistant to swing at them instead.

As for too much nudity, sorry folks, sex sells. I find it boring rather than offensive and the argument that it's just natural doesn't wash. So is having a bowel movement, but so far there hasn't been much of a market that wants to see it (thank the stars above!) Same for vomiting.

Gross wounds are neither here nor there as far as I'm concerned but hubby and I are in the medical biz. Been there, done that.

So, when people want to make money via the movie/television route, they have to assure investors that they are going to make money (first) and secure a demographic (second). Every single day millions of kids get a year older and they all want to see what grownups won't let them see. And since they are largely latch-key kids (coming home to no one every afternoon), they make piles of money showing them as much as they can. This insures brand loyalty, a much valued consideration.

Don't like that? Me neither. Therefore, ladies, GO HOME! Raise your own kids (maybe I should say don't have them so quick) and monitor their viewing habits. And would it be too too much to ask them to tell the poor tykes what sex is all about?",1476057600,,4824,4.609101516919487

5179218,5,B008RA61TO,"Oh, I love this series.  Why did I wait so long?  First and foremost... the writing.  It's extremely well plotted, with a fascinating layered main character, and beautiful handling of the period language.  And the production values are superb. 1888 London comes alive.  The use of the graphics and the music choices hark to the title sequence of the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movies, but this is not cheap derivation.  It's a very creative, beautifully realized, beautifully acted series.  No fake steampunk add-ons here, this is a well researched show.  I happen to be an author working in precisely this time period and I recognize the care and attention to detail that has gone into every aspect of this show from the forensic science available at the time (some terrific work on THAT here!) as well as the social conditions, and the politics surrounding the police and the Ripper case of the day.  Just a fantastic show.  Kudos to the creators and the deliciously sensitive performance of Matthew MacFadyen.  (Who I saw onstage in London playing a hilarious Jeeves in Jeeves and Wooster - this RADA trained actor delivers! )  Could not recommend this show more highly -- British television at its best.",1470614400,2,1200,4.8861386138613865

5179233,5,B008RA61TO,"Thought this was merely going to be a Ripper rehash but it's far different. Though revealing a great deal about life and manners in Victorian times, it also reveals exactly how primitive crime detection was...both the methods as well as all the political red tape obstructing justice on occasion.

Using the character portraying the detective who actually investigated the RIpper murders as a man obsessed with laying every crime committed in the White Chapel area at that villain's feet, the story centers around another policeman's struggle to solve the crimes and prove who actually committed them instead of merely mouthing his superior's words.

There's plenty of character development, even in the first episode with a bit of soap opera involving Inspector Reid's home life, and the relationship between Jackson and Susan, as well as what may develop between Reid's assistant the long-suffering Drake and prostitute Rose..

Occasionally a bit gruesome but the drama balances that. It could also be viewed as a CSI forerunner.

This DVD has been viewed as a rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1460851200,,1133,5.174863387978142
5179234,5,B008RA61TO,"I have now watched Seasons 1-3 and my admiration for this production has grown with each season. The storylines are rooted in late 19th century London, the sets, costuming, and, perhaps most importantly, the writing is some of the best I have ever seen in a popular historical drama series. I feel like I can almost smell the streets and after most episodes I want to check the bottom of my shoes to see what I may have stepped in while trying to keep up with D.I. Reid and D.S. Drake as they hunt the denizens of Whitechapel.

One of the best aspects of the production, I feel, is the writing which (to my ears) follows the vernacular of the period. It is sometimes hard for Yankee ears to keep up with, but no more than any other BBC-esque period drama. And I feel that this adds to the authenticity of the settings, much better than the similar, but inferior, 19th century New York police procedural, 'Coppers.'

The stories have an important sense of history, touching on actual events to build plots (the first season episode dealing with an early example of hazardous workplace exposure to women is a factual historical circumstance). That being said, some artifacts that appear occur out of time (some firearms, for example), but no matter. Many of the actors will be familiar to watchers of several HBO/BBC mini-series over the last decade and their performances are first rate.

Its definitely adult, grtty and sometimes gruesome in subject and portrayal and not for those seeking a Basil Rathbone Holmes who-dun-it. As a historical drama postulating the early development of modern criminology by tough men in a poor, urban, chaotic and violent culture, Ripper Street is a lot of fun. Don't forget your Webley, you'll need it.",1460764800,,1736,4.78

This takes place AFTER Jack the Ripper is gone and it's about how the people of Whitechapple move on after such a nightmare. People are still terrified and see him in every corner but life goes on. Not a pretty one and this doesn't act like it is. A lot of shows from this time pretend that everyone has money or only is about the rich. This show is about the poor, the dirty, the ones no one seems to care about. But one man Edmund Reid and his radical thinking tries to make a difference. It might take an episode or two to get going but it's well other it. I end up watching 2 or 3 seasons at a time and binge watch till I'm sad there is no more.",1455926400,2,815,4.006134969325154

The production values, the scripts the writing, the characters and the acting are as good as you could wish for. My only hope is that the series continues on for years to come.

Their ostensible purpose is a meeting of the stockholders of a failing shipping company, but other agendas are being served.  There is a vicious, no-holds hunt for both Long Susan and Homer Jackson.  The murder of a policeman will unleash Inspector Reid and his men to push the limits of their authorities, but they will be hard pressed to unravel the threads before a fateful confrontation at the police station. The ending resurrects the ghost of the Ripper and ties neatly to the season finale.  Highly recommended as good, gritty British period drama of a different sort.",1429401600,,774,5.070866141732283

Aside from unfortunate forays into hackneyed liberal causes - back alley abortions, war on women, union activism, general anti-Capitalist themes - the series is nonetheless genius. Despite its violence and darkness, the main theme has to be the power of love on a man, and how it can drive him to near insanity in his actions.

A great series, with a rather heartbreaking finale.

The chemistry between the three male leads is outstanding as they solve crimes together in each episode.

The writing, the acting, the production values, the plots that are somehow timely, though placed in Victorian England...all blend beautifully to create a dark, atmospheric, infinitely intriguing tale.

The interweaving of the personal back stories of the three leading characters is the strongest element, in my opinion. But there is much to impress and a lot to love in this show.

5179338,4,B008RA61TO,"I am a superficial person in a lot of ways. I bought this DVD solely because I wanted a Jerome Flynn (Drake) fix and in spite of the fact I usually avoid these shows because they tend to freak me out or be way, way to gruesome (or both) so it was quite a surprise to me how much I wound up enjoying this first season.
 While the cases can get pretty gross in the usual ways strangely I never felt like it was excessive or over the top it always felt like it fit into the story and the time period. Actually some of the cases were really interesting; some of my favorite episodes include, The Good of the City about the clearing out of neighborhoods to build the subways and secrets that come to light in the process. The Weight of One Mans Heart was a great showcase for Flynn concerning his love and his past relationships hinting at what seems to be a very violent military escapade. A Man of My Company is about corporate espionage but also delves into Jackson and Susans pasts its both fun and yet has one of the saddest developments of any of the episodes. What Use Our Work actually ends the season on a hopeful note despite its depressing subject and the fact that the storyline has Rose in trouble yet again...
 The one issue I had with the series was I never quite liked Reid or connected with him as the main character. Sure hes supposed to be the straight man (at least thats the impression I took) but to me it felt like Drake was the heart and Jackson; funny, brilliant, troubled and cocky was the brains and those two performances the ones that really stood out. I don't know the Reid actors other work but the character came off, to me, as such a hard-hearted hypocrite that I never really liked him even when he had more emotional moments.
 I would recommend this even to people who don't usually watch shows like this but want to give it a try. It would probably be helpful though if they were at least a little bit exposed to British television so they aren't completely shocked by the content.",1404086400,,2012,4.317460317460317

It is a man ahead of his time with a story and secrets of his own.  He is an honorable man which was hard to find during that era.  Many of the police there in White Chapel on the East End of London have great background stories, and it keeps you interested in the show.  The show starts off immediately after the Ripper murders, and is pretty accurate with how the police blamed every murderer caught afterwards for the Ripper murders and tried to tie them in.

The intrigue of human behavior that leads someone to murder is the most interesting part of murder mysteries.

5179353,5,B008RA61TO,I really love this series - its CSI meets 1889 with slightly more political drama mixed in- I would highly recommend this,1396656000,,121,4.545454545454546
5179354,5,B008RA61TO,"This dvd is great!!! A little more grisly, bloody and gruesome than most American audiences are used to , but this is really great.  The Victorian police force in 1889,  in the White Chapel area of London. The Coroner is an ex-Civil War  Surgeon on the run from the Pinkterton's, and this actor is as handsome as anyone has a right to be. Dark and swarthy!!!

The main characters are tough, sturdy and strong. They are faithful men, who are devoted to their police work and terrified that Jack the Ripper will return to his evil deeds. The costumes are lavish and period. The settings are often dark and gray, this is a cop movie par non. There is a lot of blood shed and a lot of violence, but not the type of violence just for its own sake. These are gritty streets, filled with hardened criminals in merry old England.

Poverty, ignorance and crime abound. There are plenty of street urchins, women of the night, and  evil doing men. There are very few honest police, and even less Magistrates who will listen to anyone tell the truth. The acting is wonderful, the costumes are fabulous and the story line is rough, tough and believeable. However, the stories are interesting and insightful, heavily bound up with history of the period, and really gruesome, at times. I loved it for the historical references and for the costumes, just look away during the violence.",1395964800,,1369,4.613168724279835

One of the most gritty, polished, every last detail to the cut of clothing, the extras, the psychology of life for this time is of such accuracy. Some of the episodes I cannot watch because of the subject matter but the others make up for them. This runs circles around the spoiled lot from Downton Abbey. I can't wait for series two and I sure hope there will be additional series.",1395187200,,430,4.3875
5179356,4,B008RA61TO,"I have been really enjoying this show, the characters are interesing, the acting is above average although, I must say, as much as I have come to adore Matthew Macfadyen, I find myself wanting more from his character.

If I could influence the writer(s) I would ask them to:

- make him (Mr. Reid aka Matthew Macfadyen) less arrogant & less pompous

- make him less iron-fisted with his staff
  - ie:  stop demanding that his Sergeant beat the life out of people by saying the tiresome ""again Sergeant"" over and over again while he either watches or leaves the room

- let him be more humane (he didn't even know Hobbs was married & showed no compassion to his widow once aware of her identity)

- less focus on his dry & overbearing temperment

To me, it seems like Matthew is awkward/uncomfortable doing his physically demanding ""angry"" scenes.  Those scenes seem forced and ""acted as if he is operating outside of his comfort zone.  His wife has said he is ""very laid back"" so maybe he struggles with fight scenes.

It seems like the writers are placing too much emphasis on him being the brains and his Sergeant being the brawn.  If Mathew was a smaller man then maybe that would work for me.  I just think his character needs to find more balance in his personality.

However, these are some very complex characters, multifaceted, and deeply thoughtful. The attention to period detail in the clothes and scenes and props is amazing.
I can highly recommend it to the more cognitive crowd. You knuckle-dragging Hangover lovers should stay away. (I did think Bridesmaids was hilarious though.)",1394755200,,603,4.98019801980198

5179363,4,B008RA61TO,"It's 1889, six months after the last Jack the Ripper crime, and the White Chapel area in London is slowly recovering.  The H Police Division needs to keep order and calm in the East London area and quickly solve crimes to keep hysteria extinguished.  Detective Inspector Edmund Reid (Matthew Macfadyen) leads an unusual team which includes Detective Sargeant Bennet Drake (Jerome Flynn) and a former US Army surgeon and Pinkerton agent named Captain Homer Jackson (Adam Rothenberg) who lives in a local brothel.  The brothel, and its occupants, figure prominently in the plots.

The scenery is  authentic and often has a sepia tone to it.  The sights and sounds reproduce images from the 1880's.  It's a gritty, dark area and the plots have grim and occasionally disturbingly gruesome elements.  It doesn't feel like you are watching a show; it feels like you are in the late 1880's and the events are actually occurring.

If you enjoy this time period and rather lurid crimes, you may want to sample the series.  Matthew Macfadyen is a delight - all of the cast are talented.  Season 3 has just been approved for production via Amazon and will be distributed by Amazon.",1393977600,7,1170,4.858585858585859

 I truly hope the BBC brings it back for a third season, so far they're saying not and that is just terribly disappointing. Again, this is one of the best shows on today and I could not recommend it highly enough to anyone who enjoys period piece crime/mysteries. Really a true hidden treasure.

Yes, I know it's set in Whitechapel not long after the Jack the Ripper murders. Yes, I know there were a lot of prostitutes. But every program being produced about this era is obsessed with hookers. It's not as bad as ""Copper,"" which is set in New York City's Five Points district; that show focuses way too much on a creepy child prostitute.

5179389,4,B008RA61TO,"The narrative is set in the late 19th century and the story begins with the tail-end of Jack the Ripper's terrifying reign of murder in the East End of London, however, the drama went on to examine multifaceted human motivations, to dissect the central characters and their lives beyond the police station. There is examination of what it means to be malevolent and/or human. The drama looked at the lives, and social ills of the people who lived in the area, and this was done through making the look and feel of the era in a really striking framework. For me the direction, writing and performance given, came together to make really interesting and finely tuned drama. I look forward with trepidation to season two - unfortunately there will be no season three. It is really sad that the powers to be at the BBC could not/would not fight try to keep this very good show going, I am sure it would have sold well in North America and Australia as well as other countries. It seems to extremely poor judgement to cancel the show. I guess in its place will be another repeat set of programming, which seems to be the unfortunate mainstay of the BBC today - all rather sad really.

Each person is quite different from the other on the active team, and I found myself quickly becoming attached to them all. The setting is London, the roughest and grittiest part of town, and there is the usual detective work. But is carried out differently.  It takes place after Jack the Ripper's last kill, but the people are still anxious.  It has been interesting to see the latitude and politics of the job then.  As classism was prevalent, you see how that worked and some of the ensuing problems. The show also maintains some long threads of story line which ebb and flow .  this makes for another layer of mystery and suspense. The human element is close at hand, and we are often given a sense of the emotional toll of not only being the law, but also struggling to make ends meet.

5179418,5,B008RA61TO,"Even though I thought this serie would be and in depth continuation of Jack The Ripper's murders, it tells the story of the H (homicide I pressume) squad on London from the Victorian era (1800-1899). The first of eight episodes starts indeed with a murder that might lead to think the ripper is back but each of the following episodes developes an individual  case  which is solved during the 60 min of every feature. This Squad is leaded by inspector Reid (McFadyen), his loyal sargeant Drake (Jerome Flynn) and the loose canon played by Rothenberg which is an american outlaw of obscure past with amazing forensic skills. Almost any case start with a body which is fully examined to obtain the proof to pursue the responsibles of such murder thru the streets on the east end of London. The way this serie is directed, shot and acted, really immerses you in the dirt, poverty and raw conditions of the people of this poor part of London. The three main characters are portrayed greatly, with their motivations, fears and issues, so you can understand them and learn to love them. Reid has a sad story on his back, Drake is hard on the outside but a good and loyal man inside, etc. The supporting actresses deliver great and credible roles to each episode helping to tell each story proficiently. Beatifully photographed this serie is a great portrait of a thrilling era in history with its lights and shadows.

5179437,3,B008RA61TO,"I LOVE the 'possibility' suggested by the name and the first episode, and therefore seemed to be the original premise, that Jack the Ripper may return.  It's a fascinating era.  The historical details could be so interesting.  The acting is good.  The writing is good.  The lead detective is excellent.  BUT, this show is overstylized and so very bloody.  I really can only take so much and I'm not a particularly prudish viewer.  Grisly, gruesome, gory...gross.  And lots of face punching and angry mob scenes.  And, although the opening credits theme music has a lovely lilting and intriguing 'Celtic' flair, the 'action' music throughout most of each episode is repetitive and crassly driving and ultimately boring!  Overall, it seems they were trying so hard to 'orchestrate' a great show that they neglected to just trust the viewer and allow the stories to unfold.  Style over substance.  Still, this show seems to be very popular and I'll grant there is a fair amount of attention paid to historical context and detail.  I would wish for even more of that...more historical references, more attention to detail...other than realistic vomiting and open wounds...yech.  I would be much more interested in what was going on in the world, in the 6 months after the Ripper murders.  Music, politics, social trends, police procedure, medical breakthroughs.  They touch upon the latter two, (a new 'death lab' for the forensic guy, fully loaded with electric lighting and running water), but then they spend much more time SHOWING putrefied and bleeding bodies.  Eeek already.  Also, why refer to Jack the Ripper and then let that thread go?  Why 'Ripper Street'?",1374624000,4,1663,5.044117647058823
5179438,4,B008RA61TO,"I will say Ripper Street and Copper are very similar shows. It's some times hard to keep them straight if you watch them both as I do. There are similar character structures and both are more gritty period police procedurales. Of the two I think I like Ripper Street better simply because the main characters are more likable, but Copper is good as well.
Set in London in 1889, the year after the famous Jack the Ripper killings for which the show is named, a group of detectives deal with the paranoia in the aftermath of the killings. Is the Ripper back? Will he strike again? Inspector Abberline believes so at every turn. And a return to the grisly fear of autumn of blood is the last thing that Whitechapel needs. Crime runs rampant and there are murders aplenty without the Ripper.
Inspector Reid, (Matthew Macfadyen), who lost his daughter while trailing a Jack the Ripper suspect, and Sgt. Drake (Jerome Flynn, Bronn on Game of Thrones), deal with murders and organized crime in London's East End slums.",1374537600,,1011,4.685393258426966

I've heard that ""Ripper Street"" is a misnomer, but I find it appropriate, as the main characters must work as part of the police force in a place haunted by Jack the Ripper. Though the Ripper is no longer around (at the time of this series), his work very much pervades the minds. Our trio must work the streets, solve crimes, battle their own inner demons that they don't share with anyone else, and save the girl(s). Over all that hangs the fear that the Ripper just must still be the cause of their problems, of which they must separate fact from fiction, before said fiction gives way to hysteria and panic.

5179454,5,B008RA61TO,"There are many things to like and enjoy about this series, but the 5th episode, 'The Weight Of One Man's Heart', was a particularly good piece of work. The writing, and direction (except for some extreme facial close-ups in one scene) and the video editing were all first class - as long as you can accept the dramatic aesthetic derived from the graphic novel or 'co-mix' which is becoming almost standard for 'action' films or thrillers these days, whether made for the cinema or for TV. This is certainly how the whole of this series comes across. I have to admit that I usually have a problem with this fast moving style which is frequently so dependent on sensational video editing, gruesome violence, and narrative short cuts or sleight of hand, but not in this case. It was perhaps the best justification for it I have yet come across when taken to this kind of extreme where each story has to fit neatly inside an hour.

My own special interest is in the attempt to achieve a dramatically useful and fairly convincing form of period dialogue which distinguishes itself from the usual embarrassingly flat contemporary dialogue which is all that we normally get from historical dramas (e.g. the Ken Folett historical 'epics' such as The Pillars Of the Earth and its sequel World Without End, or the over-praised Game of Thrones). In recent years and for this reason I have been very interested in, and much impressed by, the period dialogue of 'Deadwood' and 'Garrow's Law'.

In this respect the 5th episode was much more interesting than the previous one, which managed little more that a few inversions and the like, and which I assume had a different writer who was perhaps only half-hearted in his effort to carry out this aspect of the series brief.
But this episode which was the story, including the back-story, of the bare-knuckle prize fighting, ex-soldier, police sergeant Bennet Drake, had much more than period dialogue to offer, although without it I don't think it could have achieved the kind of intensity it did. That is one reason why this kind of dialogue offers such opportunities to the writer. It allows the writer to make the characters more articulate and therefore more conscious of the issues which are driving the drama. It's not just a matter of period dialogue for its own sake, nor is it a matter of its historical accuracy. It's more a matter of the dramatic effectiveness of a heightened and more dramatic dialogue which earlier, and yes often more educated, forms of speech make possible. Above all it's intelligent and goes a long way towards convincing you that the 'graphic novel style' that we have here is also intelligent in some way - as for example 'Dr Who',  the recent BBC serial 'Hunted', or now 'Musketeers' ( all also in the 'graphic novel style) DO NOT.
Although this episode was a powerful self-contained story it undoubtedly gained from our having got to know the character of the sergeant, and his feeling for Rose, in previous episodes. It's unnecessary for me to say anything else about the series as a whole, since this has been well covered by other reviewers here, except to say that although earlier episodes feature serial killers it does move on in later episodes to more social and political issues. The sixth episode which dealt with the activities of the Okhrana in London was almost as good as the 5th. Only at the end did it disappoint and fail to convince with its co-mix book climax.

For a very thought provoking discussion of the subject of literacy, language change and education over the last 150 years see 'Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music, and Why We Should, Like, Care' (2003) by John McWhorter. He argues and provides evidence for the level of education (or practical aspiration) in the 19thc, and later, as enabling even the 'lower classes' to express themselves in an impressively articulate and even 'literary' way, especially in personal letters; and equally capable of understanding what they heard or read, on a level more like the Guardian Review than the Sun.

I do not like the sub plot with his wife and dead daughter. It seems like every main character has to have some secret sorrow to give him depth and the way his wife is written really irritates me. I've been somewhat won over by the procedural parts of the show though. I've only seen 4 or 5.",1370822400,,552,4.168224299065421
5179457,5,B008RA61TO,"Nothing can make people appreciate modern infrastructure more than a look at the late 19th-century environment where Jack the Ripper cast his spell over global culture by his murderous spree.  London's Whitechapel district is the backdrop made palpable by this production series illustrating the paradox in the human condition when good men are willed to fight for humanity against the most depraved evils of any society.

BBC America's show creator Richard Warlow demands stars Matthew Macfadyen, Jerome Flynn, Adam Rothenberg, and MyAnna Buring deliver authentic-sounding dialogue characteristic of Urban Gothic sub-genre writers like Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, and Oscar Wilde.  It resonates with fin-de-sicle nuances while bearing some of the sound-bite expectations of the modern viewer--a difficult accomplishment.

Fortunately, this series survives for yet another season to entertain and inform.  Well worth the cost of purchasing the DVDs for multiple viewings, this series should be required for all secondary and post-secondary students--a bold statement considering how squeamish some American parents can be on one hand while permitting their children to engage in unsavory behavior on the other.  Perhaps learning how their predecessors lived, modern youth will demonstrate more willingness to conserve and treasure their good fortune for having not been born in a place and time when the worst aspects of social Darwinism ran ""red in tooth and claw"" and the late Victorian populace overwhelming embraced survival of the fittest as a truism.",1370822400,,1565,5.666666666666667

5179479,5,B008RA61TO,"First of all, I am a fan of Matthew MacFadden. But the only similarity between Darcy of Pride And Prejudice and Inspector Reed is that both characters are British. Ripper Street is gritty and grimey and England at that time was violent. But the story lines are so well written that while you might want to cover your eyes because of the violent clashes, you will not be yelling at the television because the story is written badly. British series are well written and clever. Ripper Street goes above and beyond in the writing, characters and visuals. It is interesting that the only man on Inspector Reeds team that carries a gun is an American. But, as an American, I would notice that. When it returns, give it a try. If you can find it  watch it.

5179489,5,B008RA61TO,"It seems today that the top television shows come from the BBC and this is one of the best. The acting and storyline are superb and the drama and suspense of the show just creates the proper combination for a real winner. Every episode is a mystery and drama story that stands on its own merit and they are first class entertainment.

The cinematography is perfectly done to show the era of the storyline and you can see how the poor and lower middle class survived in the hard times before the turn of the century. Every crime and murder lingers on the heels of the Jack the Ripper and he is the suspect in many of the cases but in reality he is not the criminal. The paranoia of the people in the city and of the police who are charged with finding Jack is always in the background of the times. The main characters are portrayed by splendid actors that bring the story to life in a realistic way.

The crimes are numerous and each one is a unique story unto itself with criminals from the rich to the poor being involved. Indeed there are even unscrupulous Americans involved in many of the storylines. Corrupt politicians to business people to common murders are investigated and resolved by the local police force that is understaffed and working in a very tough area. The storyline hinges on the weekly efforts of the police to solve the crimes and keep the peace among the residents of London's East End area. It is the beginning of the scientific area where police forensics is beginning to be recognized as a key to solving many crimes and punishing the right people for their criminal acts.

BBC simply has a lot of topnotch shows that are available today and this is one of the best. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely and I recommend it to you as an entertaining series. It is professional television drama at its best.

I was supplied a set of DVDs for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1366502400,3,1928,4.437853107344632
5179490,4,B008RA61TO,"Ripper Street and Copper are basically the same show separated by an ocean. Both take place in the same general time period (mid to late 1800s), both have cops looking for a missing daughter, both have a cop living in a whorehouse (more or less), and both have a forensic expert who is ahead of his time.
I liked both these shows but think I would recommend Ripper Street over Copper. Perhaps this is because I just finished Ripper Street and watched Copper about a year ago. Also I watched Ripper Street as a purchased series (probably an episode per day) and Copper on TV with a week between episodes.
The biggest difference between the two shows were Ripper Street has a crime of the week format (all of which were interesting) while Copper was more like a soap opera with crimes being solved (or stories unfolding) over several episodes. With Ripper Street you knew who the main characters were (three cops) and who minor characters were in the first show. In Copper you knew the lead cop was the shows star but was unsure how big a role the other characters would play. I just found I could get into the characters in Ripper Street more easily and enjoyed their back stories which developed over the series.
As I said, I enjoyed both these shows and if you liked one you will enjoy the second  with me the characters in Ripper Street were more memorable.",1366502400,,1359,4.524390243902439
5179491,5,B008RA61TO,"Initially I wanted to watch at least the first episode of this series because I'm a Matthew Macfadyen fan to see if it was something I'd be interested in.  After the first episode I was drawn in by the fabulous characters, story lines and authentic -looking locations, sets and costuming.  The actors are all top-notch, some of whom I recognized from other BBC productions or British TV series.  Adam Rothenberg's outgoing American character is the perfect foil to the Matthew Macfadyen character's tightly wound, repressed personality, and Jerome Flynn is so good as Sergeant Drake - an incredibly touching combination of seasoned warrior, pugilist and wide-eyed romantic.  MyAnna Buring is perfect as the scheming all-business madam and Charlene McKenna is a real bright spot in the production as the character Rose.  Season 1 was intriguing and I'm already wondering what the fate of these character might be in season 2.  Highly recommend",1366416000,,942,5.1644736842105265

Also, the focus on forensics to help solve the various different crimes makes each episode even more interesting.  The show's writers are imaginative and highly skilled. Matthew Macfayden has always been very good and doesn't disappoint as the lead here.",1366156800,2,426,5.625

5179499,5,B008RA61TO,"If you're in search of a show that re-presents the actual facts of the Ripper cases and how the Whitechapel police worked to bring him to justice, this is not the show for you.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a show that re-imagines events in the aftermath of what happened in an extremely imaginative way, this is JUST the show for you.  The writing is impeccable, the language superb and it just flows so well, it will carry you away.  You'll hear every accent and dialect in the melting pot of London, and it is a beautiful thing. From the highbrow, almost Shakespearean speech of Insp. Reid to the decidedly every day tongue of the common man you hear from Det. Sgt. Drake, the show is just pleasant to listen to The main characters of the show are portrayed so lovingly by this tremendous ensemble of actors, you will quickly determine which ones you love and which ones you can't stand.  There are plenty of both to root for and to revile.  I can't say enough about Jerome Flynn's job playing Bennet Drake.  I confess, it was him that first caught my eye and kept my attention.  Add Matthew Macfadyen (and his fabulous bowler hat) as well as Adam Rothenberg to the mix and it hooked me instantly.  Are some of the cases shown solved far more quickly and with a little more forensics capability than was I conjecture was possible during the time period?  Yes.  I can assure you it does not matter.  You might stop later and say wait, that's not possible.  You won't care, you'll be remembering the story that took place around the 'facts.' I would be remiss if I didn't warn you that one of the characters from the inner circle does not survive the whole of the first season.  No spoilers, just a warning...be careful which characters you pick to love.  Ripper Street is just a show you can enjoy and follow and look forward to.

Now I'm a fan of Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg too!  To me this show is a compilation of NCIS meets Sherlock Holmes, also two of my favorites.  There are surprises at every turn.  It's interesting to see the technology of that time period in use.  Reid says to Hobbs in one episode, ""Perhaps one day there will be shiny machines that wll do this for you"" -- the quote may not be exact but it was in reference to searching through documents.  I like that it's about regular people and not the upper class who live in mansions that have names and the servants who attend to them.  (I like Downton Abbey as much as the next guy, but who can relate?)  I hope BBC makes this a regular addition to their programming.

5179513,5,B008RA61TO,"If you watch only one new show in 2013, make it Ripper Street.  The cast is absolutely phenomenal.  I became a huge fan of Jerome Flynn due to his work as Bronn in Game of Thrones, but I believe that he's even better in his portrayal of Sgt. Bennet Drake -- he simply kills this role without even having to say much; in his hands the character can gut you with just his facial expressions or the look in his eyes alone.  Matthew Macfadyen is a commanding and utterly believable presence as the brilliant and morally upstanding Inspector Edmund Reid, and Adam Rothenberg is a comedic goldmine as the bohemian wild card former surgeon/former Pinkerton Agent Captain Homer Jackson.  The acting and chemistry of the three leads just couldn't be better, and even the actors handling the smaller supporting roles manage to shine more often than not.

The costuming and props are also top notch, and really help to fully immerse the viewer in the time and place in which Ripper Street is set.  The writing was for the most part excellent, particularly in terms of the dialogue, which was a veritable feast for the ears.  Aside from a few situations in which the plot got tidied up a bit too neatly, or too quickly, or a tad improbably, the stories were engrossing and well-paced.

So long as you are not put out by a series which is gritty, realistically brutal and violent, and at times, more than a shade on the lascivious side, this show is for you.",1364947200,2,1445,4.552123552123552

5179517,4,B008RA61TO,"There are many things to like and enjoy about this series, but the 5th episode, 'The Weight Of One Man's Heart', was a particularly good piece of work. The writing, and direction (except from some extreme facial close-ups) and the video editing were all first class - as long as you can accept the dramatic aesthetic derived from the graphic novel or 'co-mix' which is becoming almost standard for 'action' films or thrillers these days, whether made for the cinema or for TV. This is certainly how the whole of this series comes across. I have to admit that I usually have a problem with this fast moving style which is frequently dependent on sensational video editing, gruesome violence, narrative short cuts and sleight of hand, for these and a number of other reasons, - but not in this case. It was perhaps the best justification for it I have yet come across when taken to this kind of extreme where each story has to fit neatly inside an hour.

My own special interest is in the attempt to achieve a dramatically useful and fairly convincing form of period dialogue which distinguishes itself from the usual embarrassingly flat contemporary dialogue which is all that we normally get from historical dramas (e.g. the Ken Folett historical 'epics' such as The Pillars Of the Earth and its sequel World Without End, or the over-praised Game of Thrones). In recent years I have been similarly interested in, and even more impressed by the period dialogue of 'Deadwood' and 'Garrow's Law'.

In this respect the 5th episode was much more interesting than the previous one, which managed little more that a few inversions and the like, and which I assume had a different writer who was perhaps only half-hearted in his effort to carry out this aspect of the series brief.
But this episode which was the story, including the back-story, of the bare-knuckle prize fighting, ex-soldier, police sergeant Bennet Drake, had much more than period dialogue to offer, although without it I don't think it could have achieved the kind of intensity it did. That is one reason why this kind of dialogue offers such opportunities to the writer. It allows the writer to make the characters more articulate and therefore more conscious of the issues which are driving the drama. It's not just a matter of period dialogue for its own sake, nor is it a matter of its historical accuracy. It's more a matter of the dramatic effectiveness of a heightened and more dramatic dialogue which earlier, and yes often more educated, forms of speech make possible. Above all it's intelligent and goes a long way towards convincing you that the 'graphic novel style' that we have here is also intelligent in some way - as for example the recent BBC serial 'Hunted', or 'Dr Who' (both also in the 'graphic novel style) DO NOT.
Although this episode was a powerful self-contained story it undoubtedly gained from our having got to know the character of the sergeant, and his feeling for Rose, in previous episodes. It's unnecessary for me to say anything else about the series as a whole, since this has been well covered by other reviewers here, except to say that although earlier episodes feature serial killers it does move on in later episodes to more social and political issues. The sixth episode which dealt with the activities of the Okhrana in London was almost as good as the 5th. Only at the end did it disappoint and fail to convince with its co-mix book climax.

For a very thought provoking discussion of the subject of literacy, language change and education over the last 150 years see 'Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music, and Why We Should, Like, Care' (2003) by John McWhorter. He argues and provides evidence for the level of education (or practical aspiration) in the 19thc, and later, as enabling even the 'lower classes' to express themselves in an impressively articulate and even 'literary' way, especially in personal letters; and equally capable of understanding what they heard or read, on a level more like the Guardian Review than the Sun.

Reid, Drake & Jackson all have a complex past & demons in their closets which they don't necessarily want to face. Reid's past haunts him constantly, leaving him with a strained marriage to his wife Emily. I think the relationship between Drake & Miss Rose is quite endearing as he is in love with her but she is not with him, her job is to make a man feel good & nothing more. Now Jackson is a different kettle of fish altogether, he is a former US Army surgeon with a penchant for the girls that work at Long Susan's. Lastly we come to Hobbs, a young policeman who is always willing to do anything, including getting his hands dirty in the Dead Room with Jackson & his corpses, when Jackson points a gun at him & says 'Tell Reid it's Amphetamines'! you can't but feel sorry for him.

The show has given us a little bit of an insight into what it must have been like for the Police, at the dawn of the modern age with the advent of the telegraph machine & forensic science. I can't wait for season 2 to start.",1364428800,8,1143,4.195454545454545

I wasn't entirely sure if the ""Jack the Ripper"" setting would be too morbid for my taste. But, on the contrary, this detective series is a real thrill. Most of the story lines have little to do with Jack the Ripper himself, instead focusing more on individual murder mysteries. Many BBC period dramas can be slow-paced, but the writing here keeps you drawn into the story.

All in all this is an awesome mystery series with an American ""good guys vs. bad guys"" western feel set in Victorian England.",1364083200,2,629,4.566371681415929

5179532,5,B008RA61TO,"Let me start out addressing some of the haters first:

1. it's a simple thing. If you don't like programs with graphic violence or nudity (or if you really don't know that Europe has looser standards on nudity than the US) you won't like this show. Don't buy the DVD, don't watch it, and don't complain about it if you do.
2. What kind of people would watch a graphically violent show like this? Well, I help the poor and needy and have performed work in animal rescue. In my dealings and life, I have known those who have suffered violence and rape. Let me say this: I have noticed people who want violent shows or novels out of the way tend to treat victims of violence the same way. The victims are patted on their head and sent on their way, and the travesty of the mental, physical, spiritual and emotional damage done to them is never spoken of, addressed, or dealt with. It's treated like it's something invisible that never happened, out of sight, out of mind. People like that do not take evil seriously at all. You know why I occasionally watch programs that have such violence? Because there are good guys in the program that usually put a stop to it, a fantasy many victims never see in their lifetime. It's nice to dream that there is justice for even the worst of the worse (Do you think it's coincidence that some victims of violent crime relate to the Lisbeth Salander character in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"" so much). Evil like that depicted in this series exists and worse.

NOW ON TO WHY THIS SHOW IS EXCELLENT!

As I am sure is stated many times, in many reviews, the series takes place in 1889, six months after the Ripper murders. The show focuses on the aftermath and how it colors crimes thereafter...is it Ripper? IS he back? Even if it isn't, will this monster get away, just as Ripper did? Is there no stop to the evil?

But even better, and this very oddly took me by surprise, the lack of technology on the show is a perk. No radios, no cell phones, no computers,...well there is a telegraph which poor young PC Hobbs struggles with in the first episode (""Come on boy, this is the future,"" shouts Reid as Hobbs struggles to make the telegraph work). No Mass spectrometers, no GC's, or HPLC's, or DNA profiling. When the bad guy shouts, ""You'll never get there in time,"" it actually may be true and not cliched. There is no car or police helicopter to ferry the good guys in time...a horse drawn carriage at best? Will they make it? Or in episode 2, when Reid, Drake, Ms Goren and innocent children are trapped at the Jewish orphanage, completely surrounded by the boys gang and their Fagan, Carmichael,...no one at the precinct or anywhere else for that matter knows what's going on or that they are even there (Jackson knows, but that would be a spoiler). There is no phone or 911 to call for help. They have to wait it out until dawn and hope for the best. And when the boys gang breaks through and all hell breaks loose, will anyone go to save them in time?

I will say for all of us in the states I had no real clue how much BBC America cut, probably to fit in commercials more than censorship, until I saw the DVD. Suddenly things that didn't make sense became crystal clear. Anyone who enjoyed the series on BBC America should absolutely get the DVD set to see what they missed.

Its hard to pick a favorite episode. I can't wait for season 2. The only challenge to the show is some of the Victorian era slang, which is supplied below:

Cracksman - A burgler, a safecracker.
Crusher - Policeman.
Lurk - Place of concealment.
Molly house - homosexual, specifically transvestite, brothel.
Nipper - Young child.
Pig - Policeman, usually a detective.
Rookery - Slum or ghetto.
Scratch - Line drawn in the ground where boxers stand at the beginning of a round.
Snide - Counterfeit money.
Thomas - Prostitute's client.
Toff - well-dressed or upper-class person, generally male.
Toffer - High class prostitute.",1363996800,8,3944,4.484679665738161

It isn't quite addictive, since I am able to make myself not watch every episode all at once, but I do enjoy every minute and am looking forward to the second season.

5179546,5,B008RA61TO,"RIPPER STREET is a cop show.

Yes, it may be set in London's seedy Whitechapel District about a year after the infamous Jack the Ripper murders took place, but it is still a cop show.

It is also a very good cop show that transports viewers back to another time and place in such a realistic way that one almost feels that he should take a shower after watching  these episodes in order to wash off the filth and stench from that Victorian slum.

Since the Ripper murders were never solved, every time a female corpse turns up in Whitechapel, police and panicked citizens fear that the nefarious killer has returned.  However, Inspector Reid (Matthew Macfadyn) knows that there are other villains lurking in the East End streets, such as a perverted wealthy man whose hobby is strangling women after taking pornographic images of them.  Then, there's the ""Fagin,"" who virtually controls the streets of Whitechapel with his gang of murderous, feral young boys.

Assisting Reid is his sergeant (Jerome Flynn) and a troubled American doctor (Adam Eothenberg), fleeing from a dark past in the United States, who serves as the Inspector's medical examiner

RIPPER STREET is, indeed, an engrossing one-hour series, filled with fine performances and baffling mysteries.

The 3 disc, 8 episode DVD set from BBC contains several featurettes that look at both the series' production and the history of Jack the Ripper.

5179549,3,B008RA61TO,"NOT FOR YOUNG VIEWERS!!! Some nudity, some bad language, and LOTS of GRAPHIC VIOLENCE! (I thought BBC's COPPER was bad on the above but this seemed worse.)  Calling it Ripper Street is misleading. It takes place AFTER the ripper killings in Whitechapel, and of course the police are upset that they never caught the ripper. Except for the first episode where they wonder if the ripper returned, it really has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper. (It should have been called H Division, which is the name of their unit.)

One episode they wondered if they were dealing with a chollera epidemic and they were constantly showing people vomiting. I'm sorry, I don't find that entertaining. (They could have at least had people turn away so you knew they were throwing up without watching everything coming out of their mouths.)
There are only 8 episodes. Episodes 7 and 8 were toned down on the violence. Had all the episodes been more in the neighborhood of 7 & 8 I would have rated this show higher.

I don't understand why directors think they need to be so graphic on everything. They should realize less is more and leave a little more up to the imagination. I have not watched TV since 2007 and only buy DVD's now. I have to go by description and/or previews. The preview for Ripper Street looked really good, but I was disappointed. I thought there may have been more regarding Jack the Ripper, and of course they never showed (or listed) the graphic violence on the preview I saw.

5179559,4,B008RA61TO,"let me start by saying i LOVE this series! while waiting for new eps of Copper to start i was truly excited to see Ripper Street show up.

this isn't your every day period piece. it's dark, violent, dirty, gritty, intense and filled with intrigue...much like i suspect was going on during the period it represents. the cast and crew have done an excellent job of bringing the era to life.

the ONE 'complaint' i have [thus the 4 stars instead of 5] other than the fact that the series has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper [other than scant references thrown out about him here and there--more for convenience to the plot than to enhance it] is i keep feeling as if i've missed a whole lot of stuff, like there was something i should have watched before this season started. there are constant references to things that took place before we are introduced to the characters, i mean CONSTANT references! i always feel as if i've come in in the middle of a movie or something, and it drives me nuts.

if this is, indeed, the first season we've just watched, then i sure hope the writers spend the time until Season 2 comes out adding a LOT of back story to all of the characters. throwing out bits and pieces of something isn't going to get it for me for much longer. while i love a mystery as much as the next person, i really don't like not knowing what they're talking about when they refer to something i haven't seen or heard about.

that sounds like a lot of negativity for a 4 star rating, right? well, like i said before, the cast, scenery, clothing and darkness of the series saves it for me. like Copper, this isn't a series for the faint of heart. there are things that will really make you uncomfortable as you watch, but rather than being a downside for me, this only makes the era more real for me. i don't imagine England at that time was a pristine place to live, especially around Whitechapel. so now i will wait for new eps to come out, hoping that they will clear up the many mysteries and questions i have about the characters i've come to care a great deal about.",1363046400,3,2083,4.333333333333333

Though the setting is post-Ripper, it does reference the murders throughout the season, interweaving it with the various story-lines. Matthew Macfadyen plays Inspector Edmund Reid and apparently he failed in his efforts to track and find Jack the Ripper. He has other issues to deal with now, along with haunting memories of what happend to his young daughter.  Every episode has its own murder mystery to solve. Some are more complex than others, but all are very intriguing to watch. There is too much information to go in to, but I want to point out that the period details in Ripper Street are superb. The costumes, scenery and props look so authentic and it really helps to pull you into the show. I'm not sure what sort of money was spent on this series, but I love when little details like this aren't overlooked.  All the actors do a fine job and each one has their own story to tell. We learn a little bit more about each one as the series progresses. Though it may seem slow-paced at times, I never got bored or tired from it.

But regardless it's a great show on its own, though the characters have thick accents and sometimes speak softly/mumble so watching streaming without subtitles makes it a bit hard to understand sometimes and may require some rewinding/reviewing.  The setting and premise is interesting much like Downton Abbey set in the wake of the Titanic sinking and its impact on a family, this show is set 6 months after Jack the Ripper's last known killing.

The actors are very good, but the stories and script writing suffers from too many cliches and too many of the same tired tropes that have become commonplace in television and movies. My biggest problem with ""Ripper Street"" is that the heroes largely solve crimes through a mixture of luck and clumsy deus ex machina style writing, foiling the far more competent villains. I think this is a decent show, but the writers need to step up and devote more time to making the scripts as good as the acting.

Nor is it all set dressing; the acting is superlative from the leading cast to the most minor characters.

The actors are a cut above the common crime show, doing it just a little better than most. I like this as much as I do another UK offering, ""Copper"", which has an even darker feel than I think this one tries to reach. Crime and life has never been pretty, has it.

Really I would stay up late to see this if I had to. I like its unapologetic way of being a bit too much at times, almost silly for an instant, then horribly, sadly real. I think of the whole that I've seen the only moment that disappointed me, felt unbelievable and contrived to the point I actively disliked it, was when Reid's wife recovered from the poisoning so quickly and so well.

Tho, I liked the show very much, I found it confusing at times.  But I knew, of course, that I had seen another ""americanized"" cutting of a BBC show.  Just as with MI5, Whitechapel,  and more too numerous to name, the British series is even more amazing than I imagined.  Sometimes, I wonder why I bother watching the commercial cuts at all.  They are no more than a preview of the real thing.  Clearly, this is the whole point.  To get one to purchase ""something you can see for free"" you've got to add more.  I expect that. But, this may be the worst cutting I have ever seen BBC America do.  It's true: you get what you pay for.  Buy it. You'll love it.  (first review starts here):  Matthew Macfadyen back on episodic tv. Well, that took just way too long.  It goes without saying he will make whatever the show that much better just by his presence.  But, yay!  The show's really good, too!  The surprise ""finds"" are Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg.  Initially, found Flynn in ""Game of Thrones""  and was impressed instantly.  He makes quite his own the parts he plays in these two very different series.  Excellent understated acting.  Don't think I had ever seen Rothenberg before, but am looking forward to seeing alot of him in future.  The funny, brilliant, alcoholic medical man with a mysterious past.  You will truly enjoy every second he's on screen and wish there were more.  Macfayden is a true star and one will always want to see anything he's in. He is always that good and that interesting.

This show is more than plummy accents and good costumes-it's kind of like Gangs of New York in short form with varying stories and criminal forensics.

I loved the first 3 episodes and really hope Amazon picks up the others in the series as there are lots of unanswered questions that carry through later episodes that I'm dying to see.

5179614,2,B008RA61TO,"While this series boasts an excellent concept with a budget and actors that could easily have pulled off an outstanding period drama, from the first episode, Ripper Street comes off as a flashy Sherlock Holmes knockoff with a more authentically dressed cast. From the opening scene in a bare knuckle boxing ring that utilized similar choreography as the Robert Downey Jr. movie, to the music score and visual style of the credits - there is even a US army surgeon who plays the role not unlike that of Jude Law's Watson. Unfortunately, this series, or rather, the detectives therein and the mediocre scripting, falls flat of the challenge. Instead of being a Holmes inspired series with merits by its own rights, it comes off as nothing more than a sensationalistic, overly abrasive modern crime drama that happens to have Victorian era sets, costumes and speech (mostly). This was not a bad series, per se, but something significant about the time period was lost in the attempt to make this appeal to the average viewer.

How, then, does it fare as a generic crime drama?

Lukewarm, at best. The plots were nothing spectacular, only somewhat interesting, but did keep me watching, though there was often nothing but friction and shouting between the characters. While some tension is necessary, this was too heavy handed, and I confess the lack of chemistry between anyone is what eventually turned me off entirely. There were also a few convoluted plot moments, in particular a scene in the first episode where the detective pulls a piece of something from the victim's body, only to instantly declare it gelatin from a meat pie... how is this ascertained? Again, if they were going for the Holmesian deductions, those were always clear, concise, and followed by an explanation. This wasn't. It felt more like a rabbit pulled out of a hat than anything of cerebral merit. I am also still wondering as to what the purpose of that scene with the inspector's head between the legs of a prostitute was - besides a cheap bid for ratings, that is? In the tradition of some of the BBC's more recent productions, bits and pieces of this qualified as soft core porn.

Technically, I would give Ripper Street 2.5 stars, though all of them are for the period costumes, which were honestly my favourite aspect. Even the acting could not redeem this series entirely - and strangely enough, everyone seemed to speak with a cockney accent, irregardless of their station or social class. So while this was still very watchable, it's nothing memorable or of particular note. For anyone interested in British crime dramas of a similar vein but with better plots, scripts and a more character driven mystery, I would heartily recommend Whitechapel.",1359504000,6,2732,4.896328293736501

5179620,5,B008RA61TO,"I am totally hooked on Ripper Street, much more so than I have been for any BBC drama in the past couple of years or so.  The premise is simple:  follow a British police detective through the streets of 1889 London just AFTER the infamous Ripper murders.  Jack doesn't have much to do with this story as it's not a series about the Ripper murders, but rather a series about the area in which he committed his murders.  Although filmed in Ireland, the attention to detail is stunning; the viewer is left with a real sense of what the East End of London would have been like - all the crime, the poverty, the corruption, the filth - it's all there.

The strength of the series lies with the interactions between the 3 principle characters,  DI Reid, DS Drake, and American Capt. Jackson are three men who need each other's skills, and while Reid and Drake have a strong bond, Jackson throws them both for a loop on occasion.  Each of the men has secrets, and part of the compelling nature of the show is finding out just what those secrets are and how they drive and form the men who keep them.

I like the characters, I like the stories, and I like the whole premise of the show.  It is dark, it is gritty, and it is graphic - but so was London in the late 1880s.  All in all, one of the better BBC shows to hit the airwaves in a long while.",1359244800,9,1340,4.19921875

There is Ripper Street!!!  Can we hope for more than six episodes a year?",1359072000,14,415,4.269230769230769
5179624,3,B008RA61TO,"I really like this actor, Matthew Macfadyen, and his diction is by far the best among all the actors in ""Ripper Street.""  My problem -- and this problem may be ONLY mine -- is that I miss so much dialogue from not being quite able to understand their words that I wonder how much of importance about the thread of the story I am also missing.  Given that captions are not available, I am giving up on ""Ripper Street"" for now and will wait until the season comes out on DVD and is available from my local library.",1358985600,2,512,4.214285714285714

8530026,5,B008RA61TO,"We liked this series enough to buy Season 2 --and we'll be buying more seasons as soon as we finish it.

Each episode of the series has a stand-alone mystery that is full of atmosphere, character interaction, suspense, and even a little humor. The characters are all interesting enough, and likable enough, to make us care what happens to them. Yes, there is some ""blood and gore"", but nothing TOO excessive.

It was great to find a series we liked enough to continue into future seasons!",1527292800,,488,4.662790697674419

8530028,5,B008RA61TO,Amazing Series.  The  character's stories become more and more interesting by each episode.  The crime cases draw you in and never let you go until they are solved! I love the creepy dark London feel.  Mathew Macfadyen is one of my favorites and he does such a fantastic job. The chemistry between the 3 lead actors is what makes this series so great. Glad I added this to my collection.,1520899200,,387,4.485714285714286
8530029,5,B008RA61TO,I was mildly surprised at how great the characters and the show was in general. Great historical references and a great plot. Glad I purchased it,1510272000,,145,4.615384615384615
8530030,5,B008RA61TO,It satisfies my love of period pieces and superb acting.  Terrific writing and character development!,1507680000,,101,5.733333333333333
8530031,2,B008RA61TO,Can't understand the dialogue.  Is this English?,1503273600,,48,5.857142857142857
8530032,4,B008RA61TO,i agree with those who gave it three stars and those who gave five stars...i borrowed this from my sis and was bored with the storylines but got addicted to the acting abilities of mathew macfadyen and later with jerome flynn...so though i find the plots a bit lame the dialogue is intriguing (did folks really talk like that!?) and the acting keeps me wanting more...gonna buy season 2 and see if i still feel the same...,1501977600,,422,4.4935064935064934
8530033,5,B008RA61TO,"Great infusions of 19th century history in every episode and, so far up to episode 2 of season 2, imaginative stories.
Stupid me however, I found it on my Netflix and didn't need to buy the Amazon episode 1, Season 1.
Strange, usually if it's for sale on Amazon, it's not on Netflix and vice-versa.",1499817600,2,298,4.4363636363636365
8530034,5,B008RA61TO,A superb series which depicts Victorian life as it truly was. Great acting and story lines. Well worth it!,1498435200,,106,4.631578947368421
