7906535,5,B00000F0K0,"It's a wonderful movie.  I still love it.  Of course, I am a bit biased, since I was there (here) when it was filmed.  At least it shows life around the rez more like it was in the 80's (with a bit of a mystic twist) than some movies are won't to do.  A movie for the younger set to watch before they move on to Pow Wow Highway, Smoke Signals and Dance Me Outside.",1205798400,,364,3.8133333333333335
7906536,3,B00000F0K0,"I own video version of this movie. Also the DVD. Very disappointed with amateurish print on DVD. Color is way off- when we talk about ""red Indians"" , the people in this movie have bright pink faces!!! I have decent tech equipment,decent TV. Was this bootlegged in someone's basement????

The story is really good.",1100563200,6,313,4.796296296296297
7906537,5,B00000F0K0,"This is a great film, beautifully shot in the San Juan Islands featuring almost an all American Indian cast.  The story has some unexpected twists that make it a very enjoyable film.",979430400,,182,4.6875
