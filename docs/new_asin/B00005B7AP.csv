7936955,5,B00005B7AP,Johnny Cash not only was a fabulous singer but in this movie from 1980 he did a super job as a man who had a difficulty trying to learn to read. I wished this movie was available on DVD but I am glad to have in my video collection. Cash delivered on this movie! I think you will like it!!,1129334400,,288,3.816666666666667
