2961441,5,B000W4O32U,"This movie is a documentary that describes the California Zephyr from its inception, until its demise.  You also get to see the route it travelled over.",1364515200,,152,4.846153846153846
2961442,5,B000W4O32U,"I was lucky enough to take the CZ from Chicago to Oakland in 1953, at the age of eight.  Just old enough to remember much of the trip, but not old enough for a camera, unfortunately.  This video accurately captures the CZ story from beginning to sad end, and does a great job of explaining the business decisions for the train and it's shared operation and cost over three great railroads, now all gone.  Highly recommended for those who rode the CZ (I took it a second time in 1969, San Francisco to Chicago) and those who never had a chance to, but want to appreciate what a great streamliner looked and felt like.",1363392000,,616,4.385964912280702
2961443,5,B000W4O32U,Having ridden the Zephyr 8 times to Chicago from Calif it brought back memories {and tears}.  Flying cattle cars don't come close to the Zephyr.,1360454400,,144,4.76
2961444,5,B000W4O32U,"This particular train video contains interviews with the men and women who actually worked on this elite Zephyr train in its trips from Chicago to the West Coast.  Engineers, porters, hostesses, cooks....all were interviewed after many years of service. Business travelers as well as frequent tourists were also interviewed to give their perspective of the luxury of being a part of the California Zephyr experience.  I feel that this DVD is a must for anyone who is considering spending a goodly amount to ride in the luxury of this train.  The description of the DVD on Amazon's web site was spot on in enticing you to view the film(s) in preparation for taking the vacation of a lifetime to experience a train ride of a past era which still exists today.  Enjoy!",1349568000,,765,4.7727272727272725
2961445,5,B000W4O32U,"This is a professionally produced, fair-minded, and vividly photographed recollection of what many believe to be America's greatest passenger train, the California Zephyr (CZ), which operated between Chicago, IL and Oakland, CA from 1949 until 1969. A product of postwar collaboration among three railroads (the Burlington, Rio Grande, and Western Pacific), the CZ featured what many aficionados consider to be the most beautiful passenger railroad equipment ever built, gleaming in its stainless steel exterior and incomparably luxurious inside. The CZ's standard equipment included five dome cars, which enabled passengers to see the beautiful scenery (and the train itself, snaking ahead and trailing behind). Railfans will savor the brief, but rewarding shots of CZ consists and locomotives that aren't available in other videos, but this is a video that can be enjoyed by anyone -- it includes touching interviews with former Zephyrettes, a CZ diner steward, and the CEO of the WP, who was quite obviously still dealing with guilt for his role in putting the Silver Lady to death. To its credit, the film doesn't wallow in nostalgia -- it just tells the story, and does so even-handedly, without strident posturing or pointing fingers of blame.  If you're in love with trains and would like to give a DVD to family and friends to explain why, this is it.",1261612800,,1359,5.205479452054795
2961446,2,B000W4O32U,"I expected to see the trip that started in Chicago (or Oakland) and ended in Oakland (or Chicago), without cutting in to interviewing people, and various scenes. I have another California Zephyr video, and that one takes you to the beginning of this great ride starting at the Chicago station, through Denver, Reno, the Sierras, and ending in the Bay Area.

If you rather see a video like I just described, buy that one.  Otherwise, I would not buy this video (CA Zephyr Silver Thread Through the West) at all.  I would hope to find an Amtrak video that starts at Denver's Union Station and end in Grand Junction.  The train ride traverses the Colorado River there.",1251676800,3,665,4.6581196581196584
2961447,4,B000W4O32U,"The best thing about this film is that the California Zephyr is seen in the context of other trains that were part of a postwar bid by the railroads to attract new passengers. Right-of-way shots alternate with shots on board, and there are interviews with the president of Western Pacific and reminiscenes by the dining car steward, Zephyrettes (hostesses), and a curator from the Smithsonian. You don't get the impression that the train had to end as it did, but WP insisted on going it alone as a carrier and now they are part of the UP. The film ends with a folk song written specifically for the train. With two I have made myself, it brings to seven the number of films I know of on this subject.",1217548800,5,701,4.441860465116279

This one shows some such views which is nice but is much the same as other railroad videos.

2961456,4,B000W4O32U,"A very good documentary on the Golden Age of rail passenger service.

Rail fan or not, this is a great window into travel history.

8221264,5,B000W4O32U,"I have seen several videos about the California Zephyr and this one is, by far, the best.  My only problem was that I watched it on Amazon Prime and it was a bit ""blocky"" in spots.  That may, however, be due to my internet connection and not Amazon.  I subsequently watched a video about the Coast Daylight, also with the internet flaws but it, too, was excellent.  At the end of both videos, I learned that they were produced by the same people as the up-coming video about the 20th Century.  Now I'm looking forward to that.

The scenic shots are almost beautiful, but can't escape the low production values of the time.

8221270,5,B000W4O32U,"WOW, what can I say this was awesome.  I have NEVER rode on a train before and watching this makes me want to ride one.  The views, oh my God how wonderful God is.  Seeing the mountains, the rivers, the rocks, looking out as far as the eye can see.  I think I would rather ride a train, instead of flying in a plane. BUT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE IN A HURRY AND THEY TAKE A PLANE AND MISS OUT ON THE RIDE OF A LIFETIME.  Seeing trees, desert, valleys, then more trees, oh my goodness.  How do a person sleep on a train?  I mean, I would not be available to sleeping thinking I would miss seeing something, and thinking of the night time the moon, stars, the far away lights from a passing city.  Do anyone know if Amtrak comes to Yuma, Arizona?  I think I would like to buy a round trip ticket on Amtrak and see what it would feel like.  My birthday is in June and this would be a great gift to myself to buy a ticket and ride the TRAIN.  ALL ABOARD.  GOD BLESS YOU, AMAZON FOR MY PRIME TO LET ME SEE THIS AMAZING TRAIN.  Sincerely yours; Georgia",1420675200,,1039,3.9854368932038833
