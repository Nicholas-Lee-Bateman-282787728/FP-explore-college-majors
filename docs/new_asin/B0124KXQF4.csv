7342562,5,B0124KXQF4,Really great film.  Amazing in its simplicity and very deep at the same time.  A must see and gets better every time I watch it!!,1461542400,6,129,4.12
7342563,5,B0124KXQF4,I was completely entertained by this movie.  PTSD + Pot + Aliens = 5 stars,1460592000,5,74,3.933333333333333
7342564,4,B0124KXQF4,This was a different kind of movie. It had a good plot and storyline. Not too many movies are about alien pot fields.,1457136000,4,117,4.130434782608695
7342565,4,B0124KXQF4,"Here is a copy of what I posted on IMBD about this movie.  I found it fun with a deeper morality behind a lot of it.

*** This review may contain spoilers ***

When first introduced to the title I immediately thought of Cheech and Chong's Next Movie. Space weed and ""trippin'"" is what I had a feeling this movie was going to be about, and while that was part of it, it certainly wasn't anything like Cheech and Chong.

Star Leaf tells the story of 3 friends on a road ""trip"" to find a special strain of extra terrestrial marijuana, the Star Leaf. This drug, they hope, will help their friend cope with the effects of PTSD. Unfortunately for the group, there are rules to be followed when partaking of this cure and needless to say, some one always breaks the rules.

The story actually has multiple morals intertwined into decisions we may all face day-to-day one way or the other.

Primarily, if you use marijuana or not, it is difficult not to sympathize with a set of friends trying to help their buddy suffering from PTSD. The tolls of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq have left us with soldiers much like our veteran in this movie. Our veteran struggles with the idea of using a possible illicit substance, being an upstanding person, however, he is probably in the greatest need of the relief the Star Leaf will bring to his affliction.

Beyond the overt medicinal and or recreational uses of marijuana the story reminds us ""There are rules"". With great relief and or ""high"" comes great responsibility. And if you break the rules, there will be consequences. This is much like our politicians like to remind us, that if marijuana is legal, there are still regulations around it.

The consequences for breaking the rules are exactly when things go to hell in a hand-basket for our friends. While it is not quite a ""horror"" element, it definitely gets the point across. I would categorize this movie more as a Sci-Fi Drug Thriller.

Richard Cranor, who directed and wrote this film, filmed most of it right in the forests of Olympia Washington near where he resides. Ironically, Richard plays ""Ranger Dave"" a kind of law enforcement man watching over the ""rules"". Yet another not so subtle reminder, you can partake, but the law is watching.

What made this movie compelling for me was Richard Cranor's personal story. He has a brother who struggled with PTSD and Richard himself was stricken with cancer. Knowing this going into watching the film made me appreciate the personal connection he made with this movie.

I don't want to add too many spoilers, but I will write: Star Leaf is a movie with a message that resonates in my opinion. As indie movies go, I really enjoyed it. You do not have to be high or on something to get enjoyment out of the story, although I am sure the story might seem different if you were. I particularly like movies when things go to hell due to the characters bringing it down on themselves, and this movie delivers.

One can never go into watching a micro-budget movie expecting a full-fledged Hollywood flick. There is not unlimited cash to make everything picture perfect, so be forgiving. Take the story for what it's worth and enjoy the filmmaker's vision. I look forward to more of Richard Cranor's work as I think he has lots of story to tell.",1448409600,5,3287,4.609589041095891

7342571,3,B0124KXQF4,You ever ate a huge bag of potato chips in one sitting and felt guilty afterwards? Yeah well I stopped half way through this movie!,1524096000,,131,4.28
7342572,3,B0124KXQF4,"My Review is Biased since im medical and a stoner.
I enjoyed this film somewhat. A bit low witted comedy, but some. Well acted by all for this type of film.
The Alien Forest encounters were surprisingly good.
In all, the weed is considered sacred ayauasca DMT type of high; space portal back to our alien ancestors worlds, type of stuff.
The ladies (Asian fairy too) in the film were an added bonus. Good acting plus easy on the eyes.
All in all: a slow moving hippie culture flick with some laughs and scares.",1524096000,9,510,4.4361702127659575

7342579,1,B0124KXQF4,"Whoever said this was a good film MUST have been paid for their review.  The premise of the story was the only thing interesting.  The story, which could have been good, was just muddled through with unnecessary dialogue and needless scenes that didn't push the story along at all.  Many scenes were boring and useless.  I tried to finish it but it was torture getting to the one hour mark.  High school film classes produce better films than this.",1523404800,,448,4.620253164556962

7342581,4,B0124KXQF4,"This was overall an enjoyable film, which I can't say for most, even many that must've had far bigger budgets.

 Acting was mediocre to good.
 Directing mostly good.
 Plot was mostly good.
 Dialog was okay.
 The morality play elements were good other than the homophobic early on which garnered no repercussions.
 A couple of plot twists which weren't bad.

Warning: I seems far cornier than it ends up being. Some of the lines from supporting characters beyond the main three that make you think ""nobody would say that"" actually do make sense by half way through. Same goes for the ankle-grabbing trope. Makes sense later on.

To a degree it can be seen as satire of other movies in its genre.",1521590400,13,694,4.669421487603306
7342582,4,B0124KXQF4,"This is NOT another Pineapple Express or White Castle so if you're looking for a typical mindless ""pothead"" munchies movie, don't bother.

This is a strange little gem of a morality tale...largely a tale of two US Marines on leave after a tour as a sniper team in Afghanistan who go in search of some legendary super-dope and are confronted by and are forced to deal with their PTSD, through various hallucinogenic experiences.

Well acted, well written, and fully worth the watch.  This was a nice surprise, as I was actually looking for one of those mindless doper flicks.  If you're an adult...or sufficiently mature of mind to appreciate it...lease take a look, I think you'll enjoy it.",1521417600,12,690,4.822033898305085
7342583,5,B0124KXQF4,Disregard the negative reviews the movie actually serves a purpose to those of higher intelligence. However I really thought it was just going to be a typical stoner flick.,1520640000,5,172,4.9655172413793105
7342584,1,B0124KXQF4,"If it was meant to be a campy cult classic it failed miserably. WTF did I just watch? Worst movie ever.

Weak story telling.  Off the mark filming and editing.  Don't waste your money on this POS. If you do stumble across this ""gem"" and commit,  get ready to lose 75 minutes of your life to pure cringe and utter discontent. Trust me.

8725285,1,B0124KXQF4,"Overall, crap.

Cheesy special effects, America's most cowardly PTSD'd marines in history in search of mystical ""star weed"" in the rainforest of the Pacific Northwest.

Three friends, two buddies from serving in Afganistan, one is now a civilian with his girl, out to ride the surf. But first a slight side-trip. Inland, to procure the map to the magical, alien weed patch. Then just a hop & skip (smoke what you can on site & on to surf.)

It's a Quest, the map, as always with magic weed, is free--one need only follow three simple rules: Don't take weed, seed nor clone. No pictures.

The buzz is on illogic reigns...legal weed is a lot less comic.

Special effects circa the original Cheech & Chong movies..",1526515200,,711,4.656
8725286,4,B0124KXQF4,"This movie wasn't as silly as we expected, but we enjoyed it. The aliens are based on Casteneda's inorganic beings, which gives you some idea of the nature of the film makers. It is thoughtful, occassionally funny and occasionally scary.",1526515200,2,237,4.95

My favorite part is the tent scene (26.30m). It's funny and worth a second watch. Some of the CGI is amateur but its meant to be this way in my opinion. I actually like the actors, new and fresh. Give it a watch. You'll enjoy the movie from beginning to end!",1525737600,2,428,4.35

8725290,4,B0124KXQF4,"I expected a light hearted funny film to watch in the background while I worked on my thesis, but I ended up stopping my work and watched this instead.  I agree that the acting was pretty good; a nice surprise.

But the main thing I came away with was a serious and empathetic thread woven amidst the humor, which Ive never seen done before.  The movie deals with the subjects of PTSD, guilt, dealing with people who don't understand the former and treat the persons condition as a joke, confronting a haunted past, and finding forgiveness and redemption.  I actually cried at the end.  Thank you for making this film, Richard Cranor!",1525219200,3,634,4.625
