I mention the quietness of his voice, because if you're tired for any reason it might put you to sleep.  This doesn't really count against him, though.",1190246400,,414,4.554054054054054
8077812,5,B000ACQKRU,"Glen is a great teacher, good at breaking things down and making them easy to understand. He covers all the bases in a way that is great for both the non technical artist and any one already proficient in a 3D modeling environment. After going thru this DVD with Glen I have a much better grasp not only of Silo, but 3D concepts as a whole. There are allot of DVDs out there that are really good... but a bit beyond where I'm at some times, this one didn't leave me scratching my head.",1167782400,,485,4.170212765957447
8077813,5,B000ACQKRU,"I first had a look at Silo after seeing some of the very cool stuff people are doing with it. I thought I was happy with my existing modeller, but modelling with Silo is very much more streamlined, you do the same stuff,  but faster, and in some cases, more elegantly.

I also got the 'Get Into ZBrush' DVD  by the same author, so I knew it would be good. This DVD was very useful for showing me how to apply my existing modelling knowledge to the Silo environment. It took me from 'Not another tool to learn' to 'Wow - this is fast'

I found the session on the Topology Brush to be particularly beneficial as my current modelling package doesn't have this functionality, and I am always struggling to get the cleanest model.

Watching Glen work and getting a better understanding of the Silo / ZBrush modelling workflow has made me totally rethink my production pipeline.",1122336000,10,872,4.493670886075949
