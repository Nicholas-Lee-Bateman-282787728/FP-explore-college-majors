2626731,5,B000H4JH30,This season is even  better than the first as you get to know more about the characters personal lives.  Big drama this season too-check it out!,1169942400,3,144,4.5
2626732,5,B000H4JH30,"The CSI powers-that-be re-tooled CSI New York after a disappointing first season. What a difference! A program that was somber, dark and obssessed with post 911 themes is now loaded with suspense, crackling dialoge, clever plotlines and bright colors. One of the main characters was dumped in an excellent ongoing storyline that eventually concluded tragically at the beginning of season 3. While CSI and CSI Miami are suffering from trite plotlines, CSI New York has blown past them in creativity. Highly, highly recommended. Episodes are beautiful in widescreen and the extras are fascinating!",1169510400,5,595,5.408602150537634
2626733,4,B000H4JH30,"Placed in the mood of New York rhythms,this second season is as good as the first one. Each case is interesting and different than the Las Vegas and Maimi series. An all time classic for the fans of action combined with science! Too bad there are no subtitles available in the features because all foreign viewers as well as people with hearing problems really have a bad time understanding the story.(that's why 4 stars and not 5)",1169078400,5,431,4.6103896103896105

2626735,4,B000H4JH30,"I like all the C.S.I series ( Las Vegas, Miami, New York),and after watching the first season I wanted to know how it goes on now I'm waiting for the next season to come out because I'm hooked on it.",1168473600,2,199,4.0
2626736,5,B000H4JH30,I love this show and the second season was awesome.  I love watching it over and over again.  I think Gary Sinise is an excelent actor and he is great in this show.,1168300800,,164,3.9393939393939394
2626737,5,B000H4JH30,"The series' sophomore season comprises a lot of surprises and twists for some of the show's regular cast members, and includes some intricate plots as well.  Crimes include a murder in Grand Central Station; an apparent homicide in the zoo; karate killling corporate execs; the return of Aiden's elusive rapist; Aiden's exit from the series; a twist in Stella's love life with Frank; Danny's gangster brother's brutal beating; and a bomb that puts Flack's life in danger.

Gary Sinise, Melina Karakanedes, Carmine Giovinazzo, newcomer Anna Belknap, Hill Hunter, Eddie Cahill, Robert Joy and A.J. Buckley all turn in competent performances and even though the music for this season was more annoying than beneficial and even though the forensic scenarios a little too long, CSI NY remains a great entry in the franchise.",1161648000,11,819,5.196969696969697
2626738,4,B000H4JH30,"Season 2 of CSI: New York is a transition year. The show no longer is as dark as it was during its first season, the storyline involving Mac Taylor's mourning of his wife's death on 9/11 has disappeared, Dr. Hawks is now in the field, instead of performing autopsies, and Aidan Burn is fired and replaced Lindsay Monroe.

The producers seem to have stuck to the CSI formula for 2/3 of the season to allow the dust to settle. The last few episodes bring in some interesting character developments: the sexual chemistry between Danny and Lindsay, the relationship between Danny and his brother, the wrapping up of the rapist storyline, Stella having a relationship with a man that turns violent, and the revelation of a lighter side to Mac.

In all, Season 2 is a good year of cases and glimpses of what direction this show wants to go in.",1158537600,20,837,4.573333333333333

2626755,3,B000H4JH30,"Second season was a lot stronger than the first, with a number of improvements. Dr. Hawks out of the lab and on the street doing investigations brings a vast improvement and his character is really enjoyable to watch. Likewise I think the departure of Aidan was a good move, as her character had some of the same unappealing faults as Tim Speedle's character from CSI:Miami. The CSI lab also feels less cloistered and cave-like, which in a way is good, although part of me misses that claustrophobic feel the environments seemed to have in the first season.

Overall the episodes aren't bad. Some are a little over the top and completely implausible but to me its really the characters, namely Gary Sinise, as driven and focused as ever, that help make this program worth watching.

One thing I noticed though, is that while I loved the 'CSI: Miami' crossover with Horatio Caine in NYC, I really felt like they dropped the ball on this one as all Horatio really does is charge around the city with a gun. More than anything, I would have loved to see a Michael Mann 'Heat'-style coffee chat with Mac and Horatio, talking about anything. Both are amazing characters, both the actors and the characters they play, that more of a conversation between the two would have been incredible.",1446076800,,1283,4.723214285714286

2626778,4,B000H4JH30,"Why do good shows feel like that in order to be watched in successor seasons feel like they need to beef up their sexuality? CSI: NY will hit a string of shows every now and then that feel like every show has either a modeling-studio, or deals with prostitutes, or people going above and beyond PDA in public places. Granted, you are DEALING with the slums of NY, but I definitely know it's intentional in trying to sell with sex.

CSI:NY has good story lines, and I like it's shows it's just I feel like season 2 is a leap into more sexuality that it really did extremely fine without. The raunchier scenes are perhaps fewer and farer between, so you're still more about the CSInvestigating itself, but still. I just felt like this was not as prevalent in season one, I could be wrong, and just didn't notice it.",1403827200,,813,4.42

2626781,5,B000H4JH30,"I am a fan of CASTLE so when I started watching CSI NY I really wasn't sure what I would see.  Glad to say I am VERY  pleased
with what I have seen to  far.  I am early into season 2 and I find it very engrossing and at time a little gory.  They don't leave anything
out.  Usually there are two crimes to be solved in each episode and being a resident of Gotham it makes me a bit more appreciative
of what the NYPD people have to go thru to nail the creatures of the nights that roam the streets and  allyways of NYC.  A great cast
including Gary Sinese who is perfect in the role of a chief crime scene investigator.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  The
stories are very gritty and often very grim, and it does bother me at times to see so many young lovies be done in at such an early
age.  But Sinese always gets his man (and sometimes woman).  I see a bit more of the human sides of the investigators in this
second season and I like that.  There are nine seasons all told in CSI NY programings  I have them all (From Amazon) and they
make perfect companions with  my CHICAGO PD series (on Amazon video library).  Dark, gritty and extremely interesting are
these two crime shows along with graphic realism.  Worth watching if you like crime fighting programs.  Five stars!!!!",1397347200,,1291,4.178861788617886

When you throw in the crazy boyfriend of Bonasera...excellent 2nd season.  The first season seemed too grey and impersonal, but once they moved everything out of the tomblike atmosphere it became a much better show.

Vanessa Ferlito is on board for a few episodes then is dismissed for tampering evidence and replaced by Anna Belknap, a forensic expert from Montana. Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes again do the heavy lifting and work well together and the entire cast is very good. There are six CDs and each has four eposides and 2 through 6 have an added special feature and behind-the-scenes looks. As with the first season, this set has no Spanish sub-titles, which doesn't make sense at all, given the ethnic make-up of New York City.",1283299200,,670,4.885964912280702

However, newcomer Anna Belknap is fine as ""Lyndsay."").

Otherwise, CSI-NY continued to have the least amount of soap opera material of the three CSI shows, and I appreciated that. After it is a crime show, so I liked the fact that the NY guys stuck primarily to solving the crime.  The only character in which I noticed a change was Melina Kanakaredes ("" Det. Stella Bonassera)who began showing more skin and acting a little edgier. Thankfully, was zero change in ""Det. Danny Messer"" (Carmine Giovinazzo) who is always the most likable guy  on the crime-solving team.

Overall, a solid show and the best of the CSIs at doing one thing - concentrating on the crime.",1265760000,,885,4.758169934640523
2626814,4,B000H4JH30,"Season 2, where do I begin? Let's start with the gatefold, It would have been nice to have the cast photo In front of A real New York building. What Is this anonymous structure of which they were put In front? Season 1 had A beautiful panorama of Manhattan Island. There Is more anonymity on the discs with the castmember photos next to another anonymous building. For A C.S.I. set In New York, why not have each disc, the Empire State, the Chrysler, the Hearst Tower, the CitiCorp, the Zipper, Macy's Herald Square & 17 State Street. 7 landmarks because there were suppose to be 7 discs. Season 2 ushered In the tradition of 6 discs & with that the aggravation. Aggravation that was not anywhere on Season 1. Aggravation In the form of the Special Features shoved randomly on the episode discs, not own their own As was the case on Season 1. For somebody like me who watches the Special Features first, this pisses me off beyond measure. The war on commentary was declared first In this season, the tradition began of no episode that aired after Christmas being commented. Barely tackled were D.J. Pratt, Frankie Mala, Aiden's hunt of Pratt, the Tanglewood saga which was addressed on Season 1 & no commentary even on ALL ACCESS which had Kid Rock on It. It would have been nice to have commentary on DANCING WITH THE FISHES since that was Robert Joy's first episode. I will say In Season 2's defense that It was the most Intelligent of the lame middle 3. I thought this was gonna be the only Season produced this way, oh how wrong I would be proven.

What drama they do include doesn't have any of the over-acting like some of the other CSIs. It just adds to the way you see the characters.

the producers need to do away with the techno music.

2626824,5,B000H4JH30,"CSI:NY has been going on for the past 3 years and still ramains my favourite show ever. Season 2 is much better than season 1. more violent, better cases and much more exiting. set in the the great city, New York with crimes happening here and there. CSI: NY to me is the best CSI of all three CSI shows and the best crime show. I can't wait for season 3 on DVD.

Description:

""CSI: NY"" has several good things going for it compared to the other ""CSI"" shows. First off, it is fast paced. From the opening moments you're thrown right into the story and it never lets up until the end. That keeps things from ever dragging out unnecessarily. Second, you're able to jump into any individual episode without having seen any other episodes. However, they still manage to give some characters more personality and running storylines through several episodes. This makes them a little less wooden than some of the characters on other ""CSI"" shows. Finally, the cast is one of the best of the three shows. Gary Sinise is one of my favorite actors and it's always a pleasure to see him in the show, especially supported by a strong cast. This year adds a new face to the mix with Anna Belknap as Detective Lindsay Monroe.

While standing apart from the other ""CSI"" shows, it still features what makes all of them appealing. You still have bizarre murder cases, flashy special effects, and dramatic cinematography. Each episode looks like a mini-movie and is very stylish. It keeps that ""CSI"" look and feel while giving it a New York touch. There's also an interesting crossover with ""CSI: Miami"" and a guest appearance by David Caruso.

If you're a ""CSI"" fan or if you love murder mysteries, then this is required viewing for you...unless you have a weak stomach.

The bonus features are spread between several discs which makes them a bit tedious to access. However, what's here should make fans happy. ""Top of the Heap"" discusses Season 2 in general and the changes made from the first season. ""Rolling with Jamalot"" goes into the making of the ""Jamalot"" episode and the roller derby action. ""A New Look from the 35th Floor"" gives a detailed look at the lab set from the show along with the executive producer. ""Behind the Scenes - Heroes"" isn't a look at the NBC series, but a look at the second to the last episode of the show. It features the return of Vanessa Ferlito as Detective Aiden Burn in a unique cameo related to the running storyline in the show. Finally, ""Season 2 Ends with a Bang"" covers the season finale and the big explosion featured in it.

Gary Sinise as Detective Mac Taylor
Melina Kanakaredes as Detective Stella Bonasera

2626825,4,B000H4JH30,"I preferred the first season, but now they got rid of one of their most new york actors and replaced her with someone from minnesota?? big mistake, also bringing someone from the morge to investigation was a mistake, his character is so jaded and he isn't shocked or moved by anything which takes away from the story line. Still have some great characters in Mac, Stella and Danny which make it still worth watching.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-NY-Season-1-and-2-Special-Edition/dp/B000OAVLU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: NY Season 1 and 2, Special Edition</a>",1181865600,3,608,6.25

2626827,5,B000H4JH30,"When I bought the first season of CSI:NY, I had never seen an episode of the show, but my intuition told me this was the right thing to shop. And I was very satisfied with it.

I've now watched some of the episodes of the second season, and I just like this show more and more. Especially because of the brighter colours, the certain amount of character development and the gallery of characters.

My advice to all of you is: By the second season of CSI:NY! You won't regret.",1170374400,4,475,4.325842696629214
