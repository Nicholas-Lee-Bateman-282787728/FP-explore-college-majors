1901688,4,B0000A4GE1,"It seems like the lovely and talented Rachel Blakely has a serious fan club out there, based on the other reviews.  She is a stunning presence, and is very good in her role.  COUNTERSTRIKE is a made for TBS movie, and overall, is well done, and tense.  Rob Estes and Joe Lando are believable as brothers; they even look alike. Estes plays Thomas, an ATF agent, who is feeling guilt over the accidental climbing death of his brother.  Lando is secret service agent Vince, who has a difficult time dealing with his brother.  They end up on a cruise of the Queen Elizabeth II, which houses the female President of the US (a relatively cold presence, unfortunately), and the President of China who are going to make a peace conference aboard the ship.  Enter a ""patriot"" (actually terrorist) group who plans to sabotage the ship, get the nuclear briefcase from China, and blow up the ship.  Marie Matiko joins the ever growing list of Asian assassins who causes problems for our heroes.

COUNTERSTRIKE is an enjoyable film, and my only real complaint in that the transfer to DVD doesn't compensate well for the commercial breaks.  But at least there aren't any commercials!",1096329600,6,1169,4.747524752475248
1901689,5,B0000A4GE1,"Rachel Blakely, star of ""Neighbours, ""Tales of the South Seas"" and ""The Lost World"" brings many wonderful moments of charm, grace and action to this entertaining film.",1066176000,4,167,5.222222222222222
1901690,5,B0000A4GE1,This is a very enjoyable action/adventure story.  It takes place on a cruise liner where two powers of state hold a sumit meeting to talk over peace negotiations.  Terrorists take over the ship and hold everyone hostage.  Rachel Blakely shines as a British officer who kicks some serious terrorist butt and helps to save the passengers of the endangered ship.,1066176000,7,359,4.95
1901691,4,B0000A4GE1,"This movie was very action packed all of the characters did a good job. But,I have to say that the character that stood out the most was Brittany Cooper, who is played by the lovely, and talented Rachel Blakely. As always her presence shown beautifully on camera, and she definitely kicked some chinese terrorist booty!! You go girl! :)",1066176000,7,336,4.711864406779661
1901692,5,B0000A4GE1,Rachel Blakely (of Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD fame) gives a most excellent performance in this thriller. The special effects are pretty good as well. This is definately a keeper!,1066176000,7,187,5.064516129032258
1901693,5,B0000A4GE1,"Having seen this movie a numerous of times already, I keep enjoying to watch it. Not only Joe Lando and Rob Estes are good in it, but Rachel Blakely (some might know her as Gaby Willis in Neighbours & Marguerite Krux in The Lost World) kicks some butt as well *grin*. She steals the show from the male lead characters, playing a security person on the ship.",1066176000,8,357,4.343283582089552
1901694,5,B0000A4GE1,"This is a good movie on its own, filled with intrigue, drama, adventure and action. The stars - Lando and Estes fulfill their roles admirably.
But the real reason for watching is actress Rachel Blakley (best known for the TV series THE LOST WORLD) who plays a gorgeous security supervisor aboard the hijacked ship. An excellent actress, Miss Blakely steals the show from her male leads. Any woman who can remain classy while fighting in a sexy gown and high heels has got to get a thumbs up from this reviewer.
Fun movie. Great cast. Worthy of a watch. Enjoy.
*Special Note* For those of you who are fans of shows like THE LOST WORLD or BEASTMASTER, watch for the familiar faces of your favorite Australian actors.",1066089600,8,714,4.6299212598425195

7995763,5,B0000A4GE1,"As I said in the earlier reviews I am not good at writing them.  I had never seen this before. I just know what I like and I like Joe Lando. I also like Rob Estes, but I purchased it because of  Joe Lando. Joe Lando is a very good actor and can play anything.  I would recommend this product to anyone.",1357344000,,302,3.838709677419355

7995768,5,B0000A4GE1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even with the breaks --

I have to laugh as the only reason I purchased the movie was because of Joe Lando.

I have enjoyed his acting and this is the 3rd one of his that I have purchased [outside of Dr. Quinn].

This is not a high powered movie but the plot was understandable and the action not impossible and the characters seemed realistic.

Just good entertainment -- what more can you ask for on a Sat. night.",1100390400,5,447,4.285714285714286
