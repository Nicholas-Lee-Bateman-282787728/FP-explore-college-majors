This is my second DVD of Nana's Farewell tour.  I bought the first, her 2008 performance in Greece, about two months prior to this 2007 video and although I enjoyed this 2007 London concert, I prefer the Greek DVD over this one.  I don't understand or speak Greek, but I enjoy listening to Nana in any language and believe that the appeal stems from her almost flawless voice and her ability to perform effortlessly in different genres, from classical to jazz and pop music.  Whenever I listen to Nana Mouskouri, I think of 1940's Norwegian Olympic ice skater Sonja Henie because Nana's voice was as smooth and beautiful as Sonja's speed and grace on ice.

Unlike other singers and musicians who sometimes share the stage with a second performer hence reducing the workload and tension on themselves, Nana's presence in Athens was all on her, a demanding two plus hour performance in an open air theater.  At the Royal Albert Hall, she briefly shared the stage with the musicians.  However, she appeared ill or not 100% to me.  Granted, she's no longer young and this was a farewell tour.  In Athens, her voice cracked a few times, and that's totally understandable.  In London, however, her voice cracked more often, she seemed tired, appeared to strain to keep up and stay on key, and needed to wipe her face repeatedly - I kept hoping she was okay.  She completed both parts of the concert and received a standing ovation from an appreciative and grateful audience, as am I, for Nana truly deserves a tribute for all the joy and comfort that she has given her listeners for nearly four decades.  So, although the delivery wasn't perfect that night and it was definitely strained and sometimes painful to watch, it was admirable and appreciated.  Despite the visible and audible strain, I enjoyed the performance.  Thank you, Nana; Ef caristo'.  I continue to listen and enjoy your music and envision an Olympic ice skater dancing to your smooth, ethereal voice.  Five stars for today and yesterday.

I conclude with three suggestions: Nana fans can watch and view her streaming 100+ videos on You Tube and whoever owns the rights for those videos should do us all a favor and release them on DVD and/or audio CD.  I listened to several on that site that I don't own and would like to have, especially the British, Spanish, and American songs.  The third suggestion is for the TV stations in Europe and America to also make those archived shows available to the public, for present and future generations should know great performers like Nana.",1359158400,8,3473,4.83277027027027
5382096,5,B00A55J1MI,I NEVER CEASE TO ME AMAZED AT HOW WELL NANA SINGS AND HOW WELL SHE'S ABLE TO GO FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER. THIS WAS A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE CONCERT.,1358899200,5,150,4.206896551724138
5382097,1,B00A55J1MI,I am one of the biggest Nana fans.  This is a DVD that should never have been released.  OMG did she ever preview it before release.  This great voice and artist has been reduced to croaking through a farewell concert with a voice that is broken and off key.  Nana fans - Please avoid this DVD - it is criminal to say the least.  It makes Miss Houston's final voice sound melodious.,1358380800,2,382,4.25
5382098,5,B00A55J1MI,"Excellent video with a remarkable and memorable concert of our beloved Greek singer !!
Highly recommended for someone who are a real fan of Nana Mouskouri.
I suggest the use of this product as a gift for someone who loves fine songs of all times, a beautiful voice and the music of high quality like ""O sole mio"", a surprise in her repertoire.
We see a strong Nana in a unique performance as usual, at her very best. She sings in English, in Spanish, in Italian, in French, in German and of course, in Greek. She tells us some details of her artistic life and she receives an award. What a beautiful souvenir of that concert !! Before the concert we see many photos taken during her long career not only as a singer in different countries and years but also as a member of the European Parliament and as a UNICEF ambasadress.
Nana Mouskouri is a living worldwide legend. Don't miss this DVD or Blu-ray disc.
I bought both products, one for watching many times and the other one to stock for the future.
Highly recommended is the CD (international version) called ""Nana Mouskouri and friends. Rendez-vous"".",1357344000,11,1105,4.585858585858586

8546820,2,B00A55J1MI,Nana Mouskouri is clearly past her best in this video. Her voice is considerably different and she fails repeatedly to carry the songs she once sung so beautifully. It should not have been released.,1384819200,,198,4.852941176470588
8546821,5,B00A55J1MI,Received it on time and in very good condition. Her songs are so good and beautiful. I will refer it to my friends also. Thank you.,1366156800,,131,4.076923076923077

8546823,3,B00A55J1MI,A little disappointed in the performance. I would advise others that if they are expecting the same quality in her voice as in her earlier career then not to purchase this.,1360108800,2,172,4.580645161290323
8546824,5,B00A55J1MI,"With a career that has spanned over half a century, six continents, and songs sung in just about any language you could imagine, Nana presents us with a most memorable farewell on this wonderful DVD of her Royal Albert Hall concert.  For all those who are familiar with her career and her incredible voice you must own this disc.  Of course, her voice is not what her millions of fans worldwide will remember it to have been back in the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's, but it still posesses the warmth, beauty, and emotion that made us all fans in the first place.  Sadly, most Americans never took the opportunity to listen to her incredible voice back in those earlier days.  A voice which filled concert halls night after night worldwide, recorded thousands of songs in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and of course her native Greek, and earned her hundreds of gold and platinum records !  After 40 years I'm still listening !!!",1359244800,10,938,4.695121951219512
