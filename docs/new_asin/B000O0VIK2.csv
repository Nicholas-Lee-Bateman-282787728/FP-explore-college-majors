This is a carefully crafted Show, not any old concert where some popular star just stands there and sings a few tunes for screaming fans.  The 3 hour long concert DVD set easily illustrates why Wang Leehom continues to hold such a firm following around the world.  Simply put, he's a brilliant performer with the musical gift to back it up.  He entertains us with martial arts, hip hop dance numbers, acoustic sets, switching between the many different instruments that he plays.  Most of his songs actually sound better live, such as his signature ""Wei Yi,"" and the included 2CD has all the songs from the concert.
