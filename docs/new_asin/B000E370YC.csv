8738974,1,B000E370YC,"I saw this video on an educational site and loved it for my AP World History students.  I bought the video last year because the description said it was in English and I worry about the educational sites taking down the videos.  I opened it today for this years' class and it was in Spanish.  Completely useless, and guess what?  No more educational site....  Crash Course World History Latin American Revolutions it is!  Too bad I now have this video in Spanish, opened.  I'd suggest changing the description to Language: Spanish.",1453766400,,531,4.769230769230769
