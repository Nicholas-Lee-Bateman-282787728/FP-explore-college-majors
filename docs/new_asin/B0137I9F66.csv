. This is one western that has held up over the years.  I enjoyed it as a kid, and when they had it on reruns on a cable channel (in 2007 - they only ran the first 1 1/2 seasons) I enjoyed watching them again. When the cable channel dropped Lawman from the lineup, I cancelled my cable and haven't had it since. So I was really glad when this FINALLY came out on dvd.

Marshal Dan Troop (John Russell) and Deputy Johnny McKay (Peter Brown) continue their quest to bring law and order to Laramie, Wyoming in 1879 and the 1880s, as Laramies population expands in some interesting ways.

First to call is the charming Miss Lily (Peggie Castle), whos not exactly the bad apple Marshal Dan thinks. Winning the lawmen over, Lily sets up shop as the local operator of the Birdcage Saloon and becomes a loyal ally. Also settling in for a spell in the Westerns second season are barkeep Timmo McQueen (Clancy Cooper) and ever gossipy Hotel Laramie clerk Jack Stiles (Doodles Weaver).

Troop and McKay hold their ground against marauders, hate mongers and murderers, thanks to the badge and the gun, as some notable folks come their way  some as foe and some as friend. The guest stars this season include Diane McBain, Troy Donohue, Slim Pickens, Joel Grey, Jack Elam, DeForrest Kelley, James Coburn, and Lee Van Cleef.

In Season Two, Johnny becomes more involved in the action and carries some episodes by himself. The scripts have a lighter tone than in Season One and include more comedy and romance.
