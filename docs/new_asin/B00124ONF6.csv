3076450,4,B00124ONF6,"This years show did indeed have it's good, and it's bad. Although my hopes weren't too high for this years ""Showcase of the Immortals"" as the build up wasn't very well done in my oppinion, for a Wrestlemania anyway. Was it a good PPV? Answer: Yes, it was a BRILLIANT PPV! A good Wrestlemania? Well, for the most part, yes. A solid 4.5/5 in my oppinion. Now let's have a look at the matches while staying completely spoiler free.

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield VS Finlay (w/Hornswoggle) in a Belfast Brawl
-It seemed suitable to open the show with this match as I always had fears the fans interest would wan during it. JBL is quite boring in the ring, and while I love Finlay as a wrestler, he isn't completely ""over"" yet. So I feared this match would be met with silence. Opening the show prevented that as it meant everything was freash for the fans. Unfortunately the match sucked. After the most build up out of any match (It dated all the way back to last year and the whole ""Who is Vince's son?"" angle), the most emotional storyline... we got, well we got nothing really. The ""brawl"" was nothing. Finlay's emotion leading up to WM was wasted. The match completely failed it's purpose.

CM Punk VS Shelton Benjamin VS Chris Jericho VS Carlito VS Montel Vontavious Porter VS Mr. Kennedy VS John Morrison in a Money in the Bank ladder match
-Good bump showcase. Not as good a match as previous years, but some awesome bumps. Seemed a bit unorganized though. Still, the winner truly deserved it, even if he was underused in the match. Shelton takes a bloody killer bump. I shared the same expression Carlito wears when it happened.

Umaga VS Batista
-This match didn't stand out at all. I don't think it was expected to though. Easily could've been done on a usual PPV or RAW/SD. Not WM worthy.

Kane VS Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW Championship
-Really, there was no one else that would've won this. And it's revealed early in the night so I don't consider it a spoiler. Kinda odd they didn't show the hyped on TV battle royal, but then again, WWE doesn't make sense often. Quick match, pretty pointless.

Ric Flair VS HBK in a career threatening match
-What an emotional match. Longtime wrestling fans are sure to be overcome with emotional during this match. A fantastic story is told in the ring, backed up solid ringwork. Besides the Money in the bank, this is the only other match so far that has had that unique WM feel.

Beth Phoenix and Melina VS Maria and Ashley in a Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjill match
Lumberjills: Cherry, Eve Torres, Michelle McCool, Victoria, Mickie James, Jillian Hall, Katie Lea Burchill, Kelly Kelly, Layla and Maryse.
-I took a toilet break at the start of the match as I knew this match would be crap. A boring match made worse by a mishap during the match. Only worth watching for Snoop Dogg's entertainment. He's one cool cat.

HHH VS Randy Orton VS John Cena in a Triple Threat match to retain the WWE Championship
-The match was, alright. Didn't really tickle my fancy but I can see some people really enjoying it. Just fast forward John Cena's entrance... it's some goofy marching band entrance. Ergh! The end is quite unexpected and was well done.

Floyd Mayweather, Jr. VS The Big Show in a No Disqualification match
-This match was way better than I expected. Slow, but it had a big feeling to it. Which I found impressive, that they gained that bigtime feeling. A real shocking ending. Pure wrestling fans will despise it, but it's more entertaining than expected.

The Undertaker VS Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship
-THIS is what Wrestlemania is about! What a main event! It had the big feeling to it and truly gave off the feeling anything can happen. The false finishes, reversals, everything was done beautifully. This match saved the show from being a 3 star Mania, to making it a 4-4.5 star mania!

As for the promo's and backstage segments... they were alright. Some entertaining ones. They all pretty much added to the WM feeling.

...Also, it looked SPECTACULAR in High-Def!!!
If possiable it should be watched in HD!

Every current wrestling fan should watch this, to see what the Mania ""feeling"" is. Because by the main event, the show is oozing that bigtime feel. Past fans... watch it for the classic Flair/HBK match and Edge/Taker match (Both 4- 4.5 star matches in my oppinion). Plus you get several good 3- 4 star matches. Skip the belfast brawl (which could've been good, considering the 2 wrestlers are excellent brawlers) and the Diva match.

The DVD/Blu-ray should also come with the Hall of Fame ceremony which makes this a worthy buy as we see the end of an era.

3076452,4,B00124ONF6,"JBL vs Finlay: JBL deserved an ass kicking as much as Mayweather deserved one. Finlay does have control through the match but Hornswoggle being with him and he loses focus, when he has JBL down with his move he doesn't go for the pin because he was to lay out a beating more. JBL wins with the closeline from hell eventually.

  Money in the Bank: I think Jericho should've won this one but in the end on the ladder it comes down to him and C.M Punk. Punk gets the better of the battle on top of the ladder and gets the win. I'm not sure if he has a chance of being champ on Smackdown or Raw though. But he was probably just the 2nd choice to win, Jeff would've won if he didn't get suspended.

  Umaga vs Batista: Yes Batista vs Undertaker was a good match for Batista but he just was pretty bad here. So bad that Umaga was the one the crowd wanted to win. I mean they actually booed when Batista blocked the Samoan Spike. I'm not an Umaga fan but here, sadly he came off as if he was the more talented of the 2. Umaga carries the match and Batista just hits a spine buster and then the Batista bomb for the win, honestly that's about all he did. Yes Batista is strong but that's all he is. If he ever had talent, it's all gone. I mean when he versed MVP, he did 3 spine busters in a row before the Batista Bomb. The spine buster and the Batista Bomb are the only moves he knows of late, even Goldberg could do more than that lol. So this was one of the weaker matches.

  Kane won the battle royal earlier on WWE.com so he verses Chavo but it's no match. Chavo waits for Kane to come to the ring and Kane appears behind him chokeslams him for the win. Kane is finally a 2 time world champ after like a 10 year wait for another reighn. Hopefully this one lasts longer.

  Ric Flair vs HBK: This is no doubt the best match of the night, well best actual wrestling match anyway. HBK goes for Sweet Chin Music in the beginning but he can't do it and Flair gets the figure four on him but HBK gets out. This is a good long technical match for Flair that we haven't seen him in for awhile. He gets close to winning a few times but Shawn hits Sweet Chin Music, doesn't make the cover and Flair gets up and gestures for Shawn to keep fighting and gets hit with it again after Shawn says he loves him. This time he pins him and kisses him on the head and leaves. Flair leaves after hugging his family and walks away to many cheers.

  The Playboy tag match: I'll just say Santino interferes by grabbing Maria's leg and Jerry punches him. But the distraction causes Maria to get pinned by the Amazon after her move. Santino celebrates but gets closelined by Snoop Dog lol, then Snoop kisses Maria.

  Cena vs Triple H vs Orton: I know, I'm surprised too. For once, a Smackdown mainevent was last at WM. This isn't a bad match but HBK vs Beniot vs HHH was a way better triple threat match at a WM. Yes, I said the B word. Surprisingly enough Cena doesn't win, neither does Triple H. Orton makes the pin on Cena after HHH hits the Pedigree on Cena. Don't worry, if you actually like Cena, he'll probably have another shot at Backlash, same with HHH.

  Maywaether vs the Big Show: I just wanna say....eww. Mayweather getting a beating was fun when it lasted but this match still sucked as much as I expected. No one wanted the annoying Mayweather to win and he does after much interference by his bodyguards that he goes nowhere without. He hits Show with a chair a few times until he's on his knees and then hits him with brass knucks for the knock out. This match SUCKED. If there's gonna be a rematch, I'd love to see Show destory him at Backlash. But not gonna happen, this match was predictable because....tell me how many celebrites have put over wrestlers in the past. You think they'd sign to do a big match if they were gonna lose ? Hell no, even Cena put over crappy K-Fed.

  Edge vs Undertaker: In another fine match Taker fights hard to still be undefeated at WM. Edge was great here too though, he actually kicks out of the tombstone. He hits the spear but when he goes for the pins, Taker turns it into that new Triangle Choke submission move of his for the win. Hopefully Edge reveils that he was using Vickie soon after losing the title. I puke in my mouth every time they kiss, I know it's an angle but it's awful.",1206835200,2,4322,4.185765983112184

As usual we start of with a promo to hype us up, I believed it did work, it talks about how much different this card and situation is from from 23's. But it didn't show enough of the dominant ECW world Champion Chavo Guerrero.

Finaly w/ Hornswoggle vs. John Bradshaw Layfield in a belfast brawl
THis was a good way to start of the show, good spots, good use of weapons and no slow spots and Hornswoggle got beat up, buuuuut I did have a problem with the build-up; this was caused by the critical acclaimed storyline where Mr. McMahon finds out that he had another son by name of Hornswoggle, and for months we saw segments about tough love to only find out that Hornswoggle is really Finaly's son and it was just a scheme for something that was never explained, and for no reason what so ever JBL got involved and attacked Hormswoggle which caused this match to be. Yeah it was a waste of time

Next up we have Kim Kardashian conduct a interview on Mr. Kennedy. Even though I do not respect Kardashian, this is the right way of celebrity involvement, no talent was buried, the celebrity looked they were having a good time, and it was A lister so the WWE looks important

Money in the bank ladder match
Inc. Champion Chris Jericho (RAW) vs Shelton Benjamin (ECW) vs. John Morrison (ECW) vs. Carlito (RAW) vs. CM Punk (ECW) vs. MVP (smackdown) vs. Mr. Kennedy(SMackdown)
Spot after spot after spot, and they all looked like they hurt, Shelton falling into the ladder with it snapping in half being the best. Fat Hardy got his vengence on MVP by interfering and stopping MVP from getting the briefcase. Another unique quality about this match is that besides Chris Jericho who was already a star it was all young talent that everyone thought were going to be big stars one day ( too bad none of them did besides CM Punk)so it would of worked either way. Cm Punk ends up winning the match after getting Jericho's legs stuck on a step of a ladder.
Snoop Dog interviews Santino Marrella, yeah who cares, Santino is an idiot

Umaga (RAW) vs. Batista (Smackdown): Battle for brand supremacy
Worst match of the night. Umaga tried to get a good match out of Batista but it was obvious that Batista had little to no effort in this match, it was a 7 mins. match and for 6 mins. and 50 seconds Batista was laying down doing nothing .......LAME. Oh and another nip pick in this match wasn't there three brands in the WWE at the time? Shouldn't ECW have a wrestler trying to win brand supremacy but I guess we should already know that ECW is filled with jobbers and no chance in beating anyone on RAW and Smackdown.

ECW Championship match
ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. The man who won a battle royal before the showT
PPV after PPV; the ECW championship match steals the show and at wrestlemania we thought it was going to be no different. We find out that Kane won the battle royal which did not came to no surprise since he was the only guy that can be considered a main eventer in the battle royal. Chavo comes out to the biggest pop of the night and as he waits for Kane in the ring, Kane enters the ring behind him and as soon as Chavo realizes it he charges at him like a goof and Kane grabs by the throat and chokes slams him for the 1-2-3, New ECW Champion Kane, great way to continue the legacy of the ECW Championship ( all jokes aside ECW needed someone like Kane and it was the right thing to have a squash match)

Career threatening match:
Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels

Match of the night with out a doubt and for a show like this that is saying something. Plenty of emotion for anyone who was a fan of Flair, Michaels almost kills himself by going through a table stomach first, Flair finally has a successful move off of the top rope, there was nothing I have nothing to nip pick about this match. This match is going to be the most remembered match on the card due to the stipulation; sadly a few years later Ric Flair checked into a retirement home known as Total Non-stop Action.

Playboy Bunnymania lumberjack match: Maria & Ashley vs. Womens Champion Beth Pheniox & Melina w/ Santino Marellea
Santino sucks,Ashley sucks, any story line involved with play boy sucks. It wasn't a horrific thanks to Melina's and Beth's ability to wrestle and they won so that's a plus. If I haven't told you guys let, SANTINO SUCKS

Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship
Triple H vs. John Cena vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton
This was 2008's version of The Rock vs. Stone Cold vs. Triple H that never happened, the match was pretty short but it had a quick pace in it, it played but the triple threat rules which I felt like that hurt that match,it wasn't bad match but it felt restrained and nothing new, however it was the right move for Randy Orton to win.

""The biggest vs. The Best""
Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather vs. The Big Show
The best celebrity wrestling match but it was booked very weird, Mayweather was the face but he was cocky and arrogant, Mayweather was the face but he had 9 guys backing him up, Mayeather was the face but he ran away from the match. Mayweather deserved to get booed during the match and he deserved to lose but whatever.

Main-event for the world championship match
The Undertaker vs. World Heavyweight Champion Edge
Fantastic way to end a fantastic show. This match had 11 months of build up, everything that happened in the past weeks before their match was gold. Edge was finally getting the chance to be on the main event of Wrestlemania and he did not blow it, Undertaker added on to his legacy, the booking was done perfectly, their was interference but not too much interference there was ref bumps , but not too much ref bumps. They broke out of each others signatures. The ending of this match was such a climax-tic way for The Undertaker to become 16-0

Final thoughts: Every match was solid to good; some matches could of been better if it had more effort and better booking, there was no bad decisions on the decided winners. The Commentators were mellowed and the crowd sucked, it bothers me when the crowd does not pop very much. This Wrestlemania could be considered the top five, if not it's for sure in the top ten. Anyways if you're looking to buy this show, I say buy it if you're looking for match quality; there are no extras besides the battle royal

WRESTLEMANIA 24

This is one of the best Mania's from this new era with almost every match delivering. In fact this Mania actually felt like a Wrestlemania in my opinion. Maybe it was the outdoor arena or maybe it was just the matches but it felt like Mania. Also this may sound weird but even some of the camera shots from time to time made me feel like I was watching a Mania of old, don't ask why?

1.[BELFAST BRAWL]JBL VS FINLAY-now I have read a lot of reviews and heard some people say that they really didn't like this match but I have to be honest, I enjoyed it. Sure the storyline was, well it came up a little short for me [get what I did there wrestling fans]. Now I know that Mr. Kennedy [Anderson] kinda ruined it, I know that is what you were about to say. Any way back to the match I really thought that this was an entertaining opening match. The hardcore no DQ style of the match helped a lot I'll give you that, but come on a hardcore style no DQ match is always fun. The action was quick and many a weapon was used even Hornswoggle got beat on a bit. JBL would win after a CFH but him nailing Finlay when he dived threw the ropes was crazy.

2.[MITB MATCH]CM PUNK VS CHRIS JERICHO VS SHELTON BENJAMIN VS JOHN MORRISON VS MVP VS CARLITO VS MR KENNEDY -ah yes the match that I still feel should have always been kept a Wrestlemania exclusive that became a gimmick PPV. I will admit that even on the MITB PPV the matches are always fun but when it was just a once a year thing at Mania it felt bigger. As I am sure you know these matches always guarantee us some incredible moments, highlight reel moments ""if you will"" in my best Dusty Rhodes voice and there is no shortage here. Morrison with his ladder moonsault and of course Shelton going through a ladder, watch and see. There are many more moments that make this one of the best matches on the card, plus the return of Matt Hardy was cool. In the end CM Punk figures out a clever way to win the match.

3.[RAW VS SMACKDOWN MATCH]UMAGA VS BATISTA-now I know I might get some heat for this but I thought this was a good match, especially with these two put together. It may have been the atmosphere but I thought this was a good match between two big men. Sometimes these big vs. big guys match-ups brings me back to the 80's for some reason, it felt like an old school Mania. Any way the action is quick paced between these two and Batista wins after a near screw-up Batista Bomb.

4.[ECW TITLE]CHACO GUERRERO VS KANE-after Kane won the battle royal earlier in the night he was given this title shot at the ECW title. Believe it or not but I was kinda looking forward to this match. I wanted to see how Chavo who was doing well at the time was going to handle this new challenge. Well seconds in we found out as he was defeated very quickly, what a waste. It is a rare thing when a squash match on a major event makes sense, very rare. It wasn't as bad as others because it was won by a monster like Kane but still I would have preferred the match. At least it wasn't as bad as the Bryan/Sheamus match, remember that? One of the few times I thought it made sense was at SummerSlam 88 when The Ultimate Warrior ran through The Honky Tonk Man. Any way Kane takes the ECW title.

5.[CAREER THREATNING MATCH]RIC FLAIR VS SHAWN MICHAELS-my favorite match of the night and the match that was supposed to end Ric Flair's career. Of course we all know he went on to have matches in TNA but still this was a great way for him to really go out. Two of the greatest of all time putting on a classic. This was the most dramatic match of the night and rightfully so the crowd was way into this. Flair put up a great fight and took two super kicks from Shawn while Michaels landed on the table after a moonsault. Then of course there is the ending to the match, classic with HBK retiring The Nature Boy, for a while anyway.

6.[PLAYBOY BUNNY LUMBERJACK MATCH]BETH PHOENIX & MELINA VS MARIA & ASHLEY-now I get the point of this match but I still have to ask, why? Now I know you have to get the ladies in here I am all for that but what is the point of the Bunny thing? Also I get that the celebrities usually help draw media attention but even Snoop looked bored out there on his thrown. Not that everything in this match is bad but it just does not stack up against the rest of the card, I do love Beth though. There is some good moments here and to be honest now that I am typing it the match wasn't too bad actually, I think it is the name and gimmick of the match that hurts it more. Maria and Ashley get the win although Beth and Melina are the ones who really made this match.

7.[WWE TITLE TRIPLE THREAT MATCH]RANDY ORTON VS JOHN CENA VS TRIPLE H-much better match than I thought it would be going in, I have no idea why I didn't think it would be. Triple threat matches always seem entertaining to me but I remember at the time I wasn't sure about this match. But this match turned out to be pretty good with all three guys got some shine and looked good. The ending was classic Orton punting Triple H's head off his shoulders after he pedigreed Cena. This lead to Randy keeping the title in a good, solid, full of action match.

8.[NO DQ MATCH]BIG SHOW VS FLOYD MAYWEATHER-I cannot stand Mayweather and can't stand the ending of this match. Much like when Randy beat CM Punk I have to say that the wrong guy won. You know what, I take that back, at least Randy is a wrestler. I love the entire match with Show demolishing Floyd and his cronies, oh how I love it. But then of course they have to have Floyd win, at least it was with some brass knucks. Tyson was brilliant in his role back in 98 so I get what they were trying to do I guess. I will say that at least the fans were very much behind Show here which I loved, gave me a little more faith in the fans.

9.[WORLD TITLE]EDGE VS THE UNDERTAKER-well at least that last match was not the last on the card and these two came to save it. This was a great match and a good way to end the night with Edge and Taker putting on a good show. Of course you all know Taker would win the title even after the interference. The action here was classic back and forth with each guy looking good by the end of it. The near falls added to the already entertaining match and the ending was perfect in my opinion.

EXTRAS

10. BATTLE ROYAL-this was the match that would determine who would get to face Chavo later on in the night for the ECW title, and as you read earlier Kane took this. I love battle royals and like always I loved this. There are some good spots in this and of course the action keeps moving.

The other special feature here is the HOF ceremony in its entirety with the members being Eddie Graham, Mae Young, Gordon Solie, The Brisco Brothers, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia, and Ric Flair of course. All of the speeches are excellent with Flair's being the highlight, and The Rock's being hilarious.",1355184000,,6938,4.184131736526946

3076486,5,B00124ONF6,"I have to say that this was a really good Wrestlemania.  Some of the matches I didn't think would live up to how they were billed but those matches did and then some.  The event, which was the first outdoors show since WM 9, started with Soul/R&B singer John Legend singing a pretty good version of America the Beautiful.  After that we get your standard WM opening promo which was good this year.  Then we go into the intro of JBL and some of the events that led up to the Belfast Brawl.

The opening match was JBL taking on Finlay in a Belfast Brawl.  I am glad this was the opener because JBL is kind of boring to watch and Finlay, even though he is pretty fun to watch, could not carry this match on his own.  It was a good match not too long and not too short and it got the crowd pumped for the remainder of the show.  Of course Hornswoggle made an appearance and added some comedy to the match but was otherwise worthless.  The match was a little over 8:00 and an ok way to start the show.  (5/10)

Up next we get an interview with Mr Kennedy by WM host Kim Kardashin.  After that we go to the Money in the Bank Ladder match.  This year featured John Morrison, Carlito, Shelton Benjamin, CM Punk, Mr Kennedy, MVP and Chris Jericho.  This match was very good with a lot of insane high spots.  It did seem a little chaotic but otherwise it was 13:00 of fun.  This match, I feel, really got the crowd into it and there was at least a very deserving person who won.  (9/10)

Now we see Randy Orton, John Cena and Triple H all backstage preparing.  Up next we get footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then of course the introduction of the Hall of Fame class of 2008.  This year we see Jerry and Jack Brisco, Gordon Solie, Mae Young, Eddie Graham, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia and Ric Flair all go into the Hall.  This was a good class and none of the choices to go into the hall really left me scratching my head.  After that we get an interview with Snoop Dogg, Festus, Santino Marella and Mick Foley.  This was kind of a waste of time but fairly entertaining.

Umaga taking on Batista was next and to be honest I was expecting more from this match but it just ended up being a boring filler match.  All in all 7:00 of boredom.  (3/10)

Next we go backstage to see Floyd Mayweather and then they show footage of the battle royal that happened earlier in the day.  After that we get to see Kane destroy Chavo Guerrero for the ECW world title in only 11 seconds.  I wasn't surprised that Kane won but I was surprised that he won in just 11 seconds!  (1/10)

Up next is a WM commerical followed up by Raven Semoyne making an announcement about the Make a Wish foundation.  After that we see all of the events that led up the Career Threatening match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels.  Then we see an interview with Ric Flair.

Great entrances by Flair and Shawn and that was followed up by a great match up.  It was a very emotional match up as most people did believe that Flair was truly going to retire after this match.  It was a pitch perfect 20:00 match but was it match of the night?  I honestly don't think it was match of the night or even match of the year potential but other people did.  I thought it was slow and somewhat boring at times with Shawn definatly carrying Flair for the whole match.  It did pick up in spots and the ending with Shawn crying as he put Flair out of his misery was just fantastic.  (9/10)

After that we see Flair leave the ring to a standing ovation and then we get an interview with Edge.  There is an intermission of fireworks and then there is the introduction of the MC for the next match on the card which is Snoop Dogg.

The next match is really the worse on the show which is the Lumberjill match featuring Ashley and Maria taking on Melina and Beth Pheonix.  This match was just ok and then it was made worse when the lights in the stadium shut off and we had to watch the rest of the match with a few spotlights on the ring.  This match was just terrible from start to finish.  (1/10)

Up next is the events that led up to the WWE Championship match and then we get the entrances of each person in the match.  There is a special entrance for John Cena where a marching band plays him to the ring.  So the lights are still off at the beginning of the match and the match does start off slow but picks up when the stadium lights turn back on.  I do think that all 3 guys in the match had good chemistry with each other and I do feel that the match could have been a little longer but otherwise this was a good match.  I was a little shocked at the outcome when Randy Orton retained the belt.  I thought it was funny when we see who the fans thought would win and it's like 50 percent for John, 42 percent for Triple H and 8 percent for Randy.  So it was just funny to see Randy win.  (9/10)

After that we see the events that led up to the Boxer vs Wrestler match and that was followed by Big Show taking on Floyd Mayweather in a No Holds Barred match.  Honestly this was 11:00 of me sitting there rolling my eyes.  I know the WWE likes to make sure the celebrities never lose at WM but come on, you got the Show in there weighing 450 pounds and little Mayweather weighing in at like 150 pounds soaking wet and he still beats Show!  I have always felt that when a celebrity comes in and beats a WWE superstar it goes against everything that the WWE tries to ""teach"" everyone saying, ""We're a rare breed of people who do things that nobody else can do.""  Well apparently not when you've got this little runt being able to beat a monster of a man.  Still though, the match itself wasn't too bad.  (7/10)

After this there was another WM commerical followed by an attendance announcement letting us know that 74,635 people have attended the event.  After that we see all of the events that led up to the Main Event for the WWE World Heavyweight title match.  This, in my opinion, was match of the night between Undertaker and Edge who finally gets to main event a WM.  This match was back and forth, up and down, non stop action from the moment the bell rung.  People talk about the Flair/Michaels match at this WM but they need to talk about this match.  There wasn't a moment in this match that sucked, it was just great.  Taker won the match and won his 6th world title to conclude a great PPV.  (10/10)

All in all this was a very good PPV with some great maches like the MitB match, the Career match, the Triple Threat match for the WWE title and the Main event.  There were some stinkers too like the ECW title match and the Lumberjill match but still this is a PPV worth viewing again and again.  I give this WM a 9/10.  It's worth checking out.",1336867200,,6715,4.173676012461059

Disc 1

-Belfast Brawl, Finlay vs. JBL: This was stemming off the Hornswoggle/Vince/Finlay storyline where Vince had Hornswoggle beat up in a cage. This was a good, hard hitting version of a hardcore match. Plenty of weapons are used including a cookie sheet, trash can, a table and Finlay takes a hard trash can lid shot as he dives to the outside. I did like how at one point JBL threw a garbage can at Hornswoggle knocking him out (can't stand that guy). JBL ends up hitting the Clothesline From Hell to with this hard fought match. 8/10.

-Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. CM Punk vs. MVP vs. Mr. Kennedy: This was supposed to include Jeff Hardy but he stupidly got suspended for drug use so he was out (nice job since it appeared he was slotted to win this). Anyways as for the match itself it had the usual high spots including Morrison hitting a moonsault to the outside while holding a ladder. Every guy got their spots in and Shelton took a nasty bump off one ladder through another ladder set up on the outside. Matt Hardy does make a shocking appearance preventing MVP (who injured him months back) from winning. CM Punk pulls Jericho's legs into the rungs of the ladder and climbs to retrieve the briefcase. 9/10.

-Howard Finkel introduces the 2008 Hall of Fame Class including: Jack and Jerry Brisco, Gordon Solie (accepted by his family), Mae Young, Eddie Graham (accepted by his son Mike Graham), Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia (accepted by his wife and daughter), Ric Flair (accepted by his family, mainly cause he was wrestling tonight).

-Battle For Brand Supremacy: Batista (Smackdown) vs. Umaga (Raw): Its a big man vs. big man match that just didn't click to me. They tried hard, each hit some big power moves but there was nothing too memorable about this one. Batista does end up hitting a sloppy looking Batista Bomb to win the match. 5/10.

-ECW Championship Match, Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kane: Before the live show Kane won a 24-man battle royal to win the right to face Chavo during the PPV. As for the match, don't blink or you'll miss it, Kane suprises Chavo during Kane's entrance, hits a chokeslam and pins him to become the new ECW champion in roughly 8 seconds. 5/10, cause its so short, though it was fun to watch.

-Career Threatening Match, Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels: Even though he was pushing 60 at this point, Flair pulled out a last good performance on the biggest stage of them all and what a man to wrestle in his last match in HBK. Shawn does take a sick landing on the announce table and both me do go all out, with Flair even locking on the figure four a couple of times. The ending was very emotional as Shawn didn't want to hit Sweet Chin Music on Flair for a second time but he did and made the cover thus ending The Nature Boy's long career. 8/10, for the match, 10/10 for the emotional factor. It was quite a sight to see Flair as he left the ring defeated but still with his head held high.

-Playboy Bunnimania Lumberjack Match: Maria and Ashley vs. Beth Phoenix and Melina: Sad to see an actual good women's wrestler like Beth reduced to being in this average match. The antics before the match with Snoop Dogg were amusing but Ashley had no business in the ring. The lights went out during this match, which was probably just as well since it wasn't a very well put together match. Man did that cause the fans to crap on this match more. There was a cool spot where Jerry Lawler had enough of Santino's interference and punched him. Beth hits a fishermans buster on Maria for the win. 5/10.

-Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H vs. (John Cena: I will admit that was a cool entrance by Cena and the match was actually good considering a Triple Threat is hard to pull off. There were some cool spots, unexpected submission moves and some good brawling. Cena tries twice to get Orton to tap out to the STFU, Triple H even uses the crossface on Cena to try to get him to submit. Triple H hits the pedigree on Cena, makes the cover, but Orton runs in, punts Triple H and Orton covers Cena to retain his title. 8/10.

Disc 2

-The Biggest vs. The Best: Big Show vs. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather: As far as worked boxer vs. wrestler matches this is the best one, which mind you isn't sayin much. This was about Show getting his hands on Floyd and beating him up while Floyd had to resort to having his posse interfere. He used a chair multiple times on Show and even used brass knuckles and Show couldn't answer the 10 count. 6/10.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. The Undertaker: This is the definition of main event, these two put on a hell of a match. The momentum went back and forth and at times you felt like Edge may have actually had Taker's number. Taker of course did hit his trademark dive like he does every Wrestlemania. Edge hit a massive spear, went for the cover but Taker kicked out. Edge hit a second spear, but as he gloated Taker locked on the Hell's Gate submission out of nowhere and Edge had no choice but to tap out. Taker wins the World title for the second year in a row at Wrestlemania. 10/10.

1. Finlay vs JBL Belfast Brawl: This was a fun way to start the show, good use of weapons, a table spot, this match is a lot better than I expected it to be, i liked it, I would of liked to see it given a bit more time but it was good anyway, good to see hornswoggle get his head taken off by a trash can ***

2. Chris Jericho vs MVP vs Shelton Benjamin vs CM Punk vs Jon Morrison vs Carlito vs Mr Kennedy Money in the Bank Ladder Match: This match was brilliant, not the best money in the bank match, but its up there in my favourites, so many good spots, I liked benjamin going through the ladder, the twist of fate off a ladder, morrison doing a moonsault with a ladder and jericho hitting a codebreaker with a ladder, this is an amazing match ****1/4

3. Batista vs Umaga: This was the worst match on the show, this was a major dissapointment, the match was slow, picked up towards the ending, it only went on for 7 minutes though, the ending was botched which didn't help the match **1/4

4. Chavo Guerreo(c)vs Kane ECW Title: Good segment, only went on for 8 seconds, I think you can predict the outcome N/A

5. Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels Career Threatening Match: This was incredible in a word! So much good storyline telling, great wrestling from both guys, michaels takes a sick bump when he crashes into the announce table, flair proved why he is the dirtiest player in the game, these guys bust there asses big time, match went on for a great amount of time, this is still one of my favourite matches of all time, very emotional ending, I was almost crying! *****

6. Randy Orton(c)vs Triple H vs John Cena WWE Title: This was a great match, it went on for 14 minutes and was fast paced the whole way through, I liked the indian deathlock that triple h hit, and the tower of doom, at the end the finishers start coming out, I was very suprised with who won it ****

7. Big Show vs Floyd Mayweather No DQ Match: This was ok, didn't expect much from it, big show gives floyd some good chops, good chair shots by floyd and the ending was suprising to **3/4

8. Edge(c)vs The Undertaker WH Title: This was a brilliant main event, edge was amazing in this match, countering anything that the undertaker was trying to do, edge kicked out of the tombstone which was great to see, edge got a camera shot on the undertaker, the ending was put to perfection, this is edges best one on one match of all time in my opinion ****1/2

3076491,5,B00124ONF6,"So, first off. This was my first WrestleMania and PPV I saw as it aired and it was an awesome experience. This event made me realize that professional wrestling is much better when you have no idea of what will happen. Now, as with all reviews, this is just the viewpoint of a wrestling fan, so it's all just my opinion. So, with that said, let's review the event.

Dark Match: Kane won a 24 man battle royal to win the #1 contender spot to the ECW Championship later in the night.
--------------------------
So, this is a DVD extra and it really is just a basic battle royal. Although, I've personally always been a sucker for battle royals and it was enjoyable. As a big Kane mark, I was really excited when I found out Kane won.
6/10

1. JBL defeated Finlay
---------------------
The story behind this match was that Hornswoggle was revealed as Mr. McMahon's illegitimate son. However, Vince abused Hornswoggle, enlisting JBL to attack him in a cage. Finlay then came to Hornswoggle's protection.

This match was a Belfast Brawl, and while people tend to not like it as much. I personally enjoyed it for what it was. I thought it was a solid opener and a fun brawl filled with weapon spots including the frequent use of the trash can. My favorite spot of the match was JBL throwing a trash can at Hornswoggle (God, I can't stand him) outside of the ring. JBL wins a 9 minute Belfast Brawl with a clothesline from hell
8/10

2. CM Punk defeated Mr. Kennedy, Chris Jericho, MVP, Carlito, John Morrison, and Shelton Benjamin in a 7 Man Money in the Bank Ladder Match
--------------------------
Besides the first Money in the Bank, this is my favorite Money in the Bank match to date. I was sure that Chris Jericho would win this match, but I was delighted by the nice surprise. The match itself features many awesome and unique spots with the ladders, including John Morrison's back flip off with one off the turnbuckle, Matt Hardy interfering and hitting MVP with a twist of fate off the ladder, Shelton Benjamin's superplex and powerbomb combo, and my personal favorite, the ladder V that was created. The ending was incredibly well done as CM Punk had Jericho in a tree of woe on the ladder as he unhooked the briefcase in 14 minutes.
9/10

3. Batista defeated Umaga
-------------------------
As I watched this, I remember really disliking it. However, as I rewatched it again on DVD, I found out this is a pretty decent match. The back story for this is basically a battle for brand supremacy and that's about it. This is a pretty good big man match. There isn't a whole lot memorable about it, though other than a really crappy looking Batista bomb at the end for the victory at the 7 minute mark.
7/10

4. Kane defeated Chavo Guerrero for to win the ECW Championship
--------------------------
There is really not a whole lot to say about this other than it was a disappointment. If they were given more than eight seconds, I'm sure they could have gotten a good match out of it, as proven by their Backlash match a month later. It was awesome seeing Kane win a championship, though. Other than that, it's an eight second match that ends with a chokeslam.
DUD

5. Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair in a Career Threatening Match
---------------------------
The storyline to this was a good six months of buildup. Vince McMahon gave Ric Flair an ultimatum that the next match he would lose, his career is over. This match was one for the ages as Shawn Michaels steals the show like he always does at WrestleMania and Ric Flair puts on one last amazing match before he retires. The match was filled with pure emotion, including Shawn Michaels doing a sick springboard moonsault across the announce table and the final superkick, ending Ric Flair's thirty plus year career at around 20 minutes. The most dramatic match of the night by far, which followed up by an equally emotional farewell for Ric Flair the next night on Raw.
10/10

6. Beth Phoenix and Melina defeated Maria and Ashley in a Lumberjill Match
-----------------------------
Funny how the talented divas are on the heel team as the face team was two divas that received short Playboy pushes. The match was your basic uneventful diva tag team match. The right team won as Beth hit the glam slam on Maria. After the match, Maria got a kiss from Snoop Dogg.
3/10

7. Randy Orton defeated Triple H and John Cena to retain the WWE Championship
-----------------------------
I really enjoyed this match as it felt like a main event of WrestleMania should, although I was really surprised that this wasn't the main event. I much prefer their match at Night of Champions 2009, as this match was too short and ended as I was really getting into it. Some really cool parts of this match were Orton's double DDT on Triple H and Cena, the tower crossbody, and the ending which saw Triple H hit the pedigree on Cena, only for Orton to punt Triple H and pin Cena for what I thought was a surprise ending at 15 minutes.
9/10

8. Floyd Mayweather defeated Big Show in a No DQ match
-------------------------------
Now, this match was probably the very best celebrity involvement I have ever seen in professional wrestling. Mayweather and Big Show put on a very entertaining 12 minute match as Big Show nearly has Mayweather beat numerous times, but Mayweather gets the knockout with the brass knuckle use.
8.5/10

9. The Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship
-----------------------------------
This match is my favorite WrestleMania main event ever. This match just told an amazing story as it started out slow, but progressively picked the pace up. Edge countered many of Undertaker's signature moves until Undertaker hit a tombstone, but the ref was out. By the way, Charles Robinson running down the ramp was a funny sight. Edge hit a second spear on Undertaker, but Undertaker countered into Hell's Gate, causing Edge to tap out at the 24 minute mark. That moment in time, I really rethought the obvious result. This was one hell of a match and I'm glad to have witnessed it as it progressed.
10/10

Finlay vs. JBL-Belfast Brawl
An ok opener. I wasn't very crazy about this match and just thought that it was kind of a filler. Really these two didn't have a good rivalry going and this should have just been on RAW. This would have been a good match if JBLOSER hadn't have made it so slow. But the only good thing about this match is that it has a lot of good weapon use.
Match rating:3/5

CM Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Chris Jericho vs. Carlito vs. MVP vs. John Morrison-Money In The Bank Ladder match
A good match. Just like all the other money in the bank ladder matches, this match has a lot of highflying moves by morrison, punk, carlito, and benjamin. A wild moment with Benjamin flipping off a ladder and landing and going through another, and the crazy top rope moonsault with a ladder by morrison. Clever ending with punk getting the case after jericho got stuck in the ladder.
match rating:4/5

Battle of the Brands
Batiista vs. Umaga
Ok match. These two didn't have a great rivalry going, but this match is almost solid. Both men had a lot of moments like batista getting a botched batista bomb.
Match rating:3.25/5

ECW championship
Kane vs. Chavo Guerrero
No comment.
match rating:1/5

Career threatening match
Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair
Another classic put on by these two. Put these two in a match and you will get one freakin' awesome bout. This match was voted match of the year and i agree. This match had moments like hbk missing a moonsault and going through the announce table, the 2 sweet chin music's, and the ""Im sorry, i love you"" said by michaels. Great match here and worth watching.
Match rating:5/5

Playboy Bunnymania lumberjack match
Beth Phoenix and Melina vs. Maria and Ashely
Terrible match here. Only five minuets and this thing is over. This match had no action and was the worst match of the night.
Match rating:0/5

Triple threat match for the WWE championship
Randy Orton vs. Triple H vs. John Cena
Good, solid match here, but way too short. This match had a lot of aggressive action and was good. This match went from cen/orton, to cena/orton/hhh because of a elimination chamber a month earlier. Good moments like a crossbody electric chair on cena. Cheap win by orton getting the pin on cena after a pedigree and punt on triple h.

This match was what was headlining wrestlemania. But, in my opinion, this match was just all hype. This match was just plain out dominated by show. The match didn't get good until the end when Maywheather tried to leave and show put him back in the ring. Funny and great moment when show gets knocked out with brass knuckles.
match rating:2.75/5

World Heavyweight championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
This is one of their best and first encounter of 2008. The buildup for this match was great after taker won a #1 contendership elimination chamber at no way out. This match had everything from counters, to submissions, to finishers, to even a cheap interferance by the edge heads(hawkins and ryder). Great ending with taker winning by submission and making edge bleed from his mouth. Definatly a match worth watching.
Match rating:5/5

This ppv is highly recomended and a great way to start a collection. The best matches that are definatly worth watching are the world title, michaels/flair, and triple threat match.",1262217600,,3518,4.714983713355049

3076497,4,B00124ONF6,"Belfast Brawl: JBL vs. Finlay (with Hornswoggle)
Nothing like a good 'ole hardcore match to start off the evening at the WWE's biggest and most important event of the year. The match was actually pretty good, with Finlay taking some nasty head shots with trashcans and trashcan lids. There was some back-and-forth action, with JBL also taking quite a few bumps, including a counter by Finlay off of steel steps, and Hornswoggle beat the crap out of JBL with a kendo stick at one point. The highlight of the match was when Finlay dived through the middle ropes and JBL dodged him and smacked him right in the head with a trashcan lid. JBL ate a Celtic Cross and was thrown through a table set up in the corner, but still kicked out. The finish came when JBL took Hornswoggle out by throwing a trashcan at him and then hit Finlay with the Clothesline from Hell to get the win. Winner: JBL. Match Rating: 4/5

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Carlito vs. Chris Jericho vs. CM Punk vs. John Morrison vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin
Another great match but it really pales in comparison to last year's Money in the Bank. There were some sick ladder shots everywhere, but there wasn't really anything new we were seeing. Morrison hit a moonsault to the outside onto most of his opponents using a ladder, which was a sick spot. At one point, Kennedy was about to superplex John Morrison off a ladder, but Shelton Benjamin, climbing the ladder next to them, hit a sunset flip powerbomb on Mr. Kennedy off the ladder, causing Kennedy to hit the superplex on Morrison at the same time! That was awesome. Later in the match, Shelton Benjamin got taken out of the contest after he was spilled off a ladder and through a ladder set up like a bridge, similar to what Jeff Hardy did to Edge last year. It would have been much cooler if we hadn't already seen it before, is what I'm saying. Carlito hit a Backstabber to Jericho off a ladder, which was awesome, and Jericho and MVP had a little ""jousting"" spot with ladders that was also interesting. Carlito spit apples in Mr. Kennedy's face, and Morrison got knocked onto the top rope off a ladder right on his groin, ala Shawn Michaels. Jericho nailed CM Punk with a Codebreaker using a ladder, which was also a sweet spot, but at one point, everyone in the match was down except for MVP. MVP started climbing the ladder, but then Matt Hardy (!!!) ran out to a big pop and hit MVP with a Twist of Fate off the top of the ladder to prevent him from winning the match! The run-in was sweet, if not a little expected, and it was sweet, sweet justice since MVP had injured Matt months before. The end came when Jericho locked in the Walls of Jericho on John Morrison using the ladder and Mr. Kennedy then attempted to grab the briefcase, but CM Punk hit him with a ladder in a way similar to how Kennedy hit CM Punk at last year's match. Jericho and Punk then battled over the briefcase, but Punk tripped Jericho, causing Jericho to get stuck in a ladder rung and allowing CM Punk to win the match. It was an amazing and phenomenal match, it just wasn't as good as last year's. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 5/5

Battle for Brand Supremacy: Batista (with Theodore Long) vs. Umaga (with William Regal)
The consistantly good matches keep on rolling in for this pay-per-view. It's SmackDown! vs. Raw for this match, with Batista representing SmackDown and being managed by SmackDown's assistant General Manager Teddy Long, and Umaga being managed by Raw's General Manager William Regal. The match was pretty straight-forward, with Umaga actually dominating Batista for a good portion of the match, and the crowd even got behind Umaga a little. Batista did an excellent job of selling Umaga's submission maneuvers, no matter how stupid they were, and Umaga missed a flying headbutt off the second turnbuckle on Batista. Batista tried to scoop slam Umaga at another point, but Umaga converted the move into a crossbody. Later, Umaga tried to hit Batista with the Samoan Spike, but Batista powered out and hit the Spinebuster out of nowhere! He followed up with an astonishing Batista Bomb on the giant Umaga to get the pinfall and win the match for SmackDown!. Nothing amazing, but it was still a very solid and very entertaining match. Winner: Batista. Match Rating: 4/5

ECW Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kane
Wow, what a terrible idea. Instead of keeping the momentum and having an at least decent match between Chavo and Kane, the WWE decided to end this match in less than ten seconds. Basically, Kane starts out in the ring behind Chavo, having come through the crowd, gives Chavo a Chokeslam, and then pins him to win the ECW title. It's cool to see Kane with a championship again, but Chavo really deserves much more credit than to be beaten with a single move. Still, I'd rather have the crap short and sweet than long and painful. Winner: Kane. Match Rating: 2/5

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels
Emotions. When a wrestling match makes you feel emotional, that's when you know it's an absolute classic. The stipulation was, once again, that if Ric Flair lost, he would be forced to retire. The match started out with a lot of powerful chops and with Flair and Michaels doing their usual routine, albeit with a lot more force put behind it. Flair took a lot of bumps, being dumped to the outside and landing pretty damn hard, but he nailed a picture-perfect flying crossbody on Michaels. At one point, Flair was resting against the announce table, and Michaels tried to hit him a springboard moonsault, but Flair moved out of the way, and Michaels hit his stomach on the edge of the table, with the rest of his body going through it! Absolutely breathtaking! Flair dominated for a portion of the match, focusing on Michael's now injured abdomen. Momentum went back to Michaels, and he nailed the Flying Elbow Drop! He then went for the Sweet Chin Music but hesitated at the last second. Flair tripped him and then locked on the Figure Four! Michaels was in the submission hold for a long time, but he got the ropes. Flair locked in the Figure Four Leg Lock again later, which led to a flurry of perfect counters from both competitors. The match went outside again, and Michaels hit a moonsault on Flair that was quite the spectacle. Back in the ring, Michaels hit Flair with the Sweet Chin Music, but astonishingly, Flair kicked out! Flair kicked Michaels in the groin, and when Michaels locked on the Figure Four, Flair's own maneuver, on the Nature Boy, Flair distracted the referee by taking the bottom turnbuckle off. This gave Flair the opportunity to poke Michaels in the eyes, just like the old days! The match continued with solid back-and-forth action, but Michaels went to a corner, ready to nail the Sweet Chin Music on Flair again. Tears were going down Michaels's cheeks, and Flair, bleeding from the mouth when Shawn slapped him in the face at the beginning of the match, stood up, ready to try to fight Michaels. Shawn said, ""I'm sorry. I love you."" and hit Flair with the Sweet Chin Music. That was all she wrote, and the legendary career of Ric Flair was brought to a close in one of the most emotional and heartbreaking matches in not only WrestleMania history, but the entire history of professional wrestling. Winner: Shawn Michaels. Match Rating: 5/5

Lumberjill Tag Team Match: Ashley and Maria vs. Beth Phoenix and Melina (with Santino Marella)
I was surprised that this match was actually good. Beth Phoenix is very talented as a wrestler and she reminds me of Chyna in so many ways, and coupled with the talent of Melina, I was still in doubt. I mean, Ashley and Maria are basically only known for their sexiness, and that's about all they're good for. Well, the match actually proved to be entertaining. Snoop Dogg was at ringside in a big old chair that looked like the King of the Ring chair, and there were a bunch of Lumberjills, basically all the other WWE Divas working for the company, surrounding the ring. Even Victoria was out there, which was nice. I miss her. Regardless, the match had some basic moves, with a surprisingly nice headscissors by Ashley, and Melina and Phoenix stole the show with an awesome moonsault off of Phoenix's shoulders by Melina. Santino interrupted a cover by Maria, so Jerry ""The King"" Lawler got up from his announcing seat and punched Santino in the face! Melina and Ashley and all the other Divas ended up in a brawl outside of the ring, and Phoenix took advantage of the chaos by hitting Maria with a stalled fisherman's suplex to get the pin. Winners: Beth Phoenix and Melina. Match Rating: 3/5

Triple Threat WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. John Cena vs. Triple H
This match literally made me laugh out loud by the end of it. Throughout the contest, Cena, Triple H, and Orton did their usual stuff, with Orton trying to use cheap tactics at the start by nailing Triple H in the face with the WWE Championship. Cena showed off by getting both Triple H and Orton on his shoulders, but Triple H fell off and then kicked Cena right in the groin! Orton performed a double DDT off the second rope to Triple H and Cena, and then couldn't decide who to RKO in a particularly entertaining part of the match where Orton was crawling around and drooling in anticipation. It was almost scary. Cena got up first, and Orton tried to RKO him, but Cena pushed him onto Triple H! The rest of the match was pretty solid, with Orton nailing the RKO on Triple H, who smartly rolled out of the ring, to Cena locking on the STFU on Orton. Triple H got back into the contest and started brawling with Cena, incapacitating him by throwing him so hard into the steel steps that they literally flew out of position. Back in the ring, Triple H tried a very well done inverted Indian death lock, but Cena broke up the submission. Orton then suffered yet another STFU from Cena, but Triple H broke it up by pulling Cena's arm away from Orton's face and locking in the Crossface! Cena got the ropes, unfortunately, and the match went on with Cena nailing his usual power moves and Triple H taking most of the pain. However, Triple H managed to hit Cena with the Pedigree out of nowhere! Triple H made the cover, but Orton punted Triple H in the head, his good `ole concussion kick, and then pinned Cena for the win! Hilarious ending! I love it when Cena loses, and it was awesome to see Randy Orton, the best bad guy around in WWE right now, retain his championship at WrestleMania. Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

No Disqualification Match: Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather (with his entourage) vs. The Big Show
Just like the women's tag team match earlier, this match surprised me with its quality. Big Show took some sick jabs from Mayweather at the outset, and Mayweather outmatched Show with his speed. The fans were behind Big Show the entire time, which was great and it worked really well, especially when Big Show started nailing some moves back. Big Show actually stomped on Mayweather's arm, and he knocked a member of his entourage off the apron when Mayweather started mocking Big Show. Show gave one of Mayweather's entourage members a sick chop across the chest, and then followed up with one for Mayweather. Mayweather and his entourage then started to retreat down the ramp, but Big Show followed them, taking out a few members of Mayweather's entourage, and then dragged Mayweather by his head back down to the ring! Show was about to nail his Chokeslam, but a member of Mayweather's entourage ran in and smacked Show in the back with a chair. Show responded with a Chokeslam for this guy, but then ate a chair to the head and back from Mayweather! Mayweather then hit Big Show with two absolutely sick chair shots, and then pulled some brass knuckles off of one of his unconscious entourage members. Mayweather straight-up punched Show right in the face with the brass knuckles and pinned him for the win. It's disappointing that we didn't get to see Mayweather get Chokeslammed, but the match was pretty entertaining, and it was cool to see the fans behind Big Show. Winner: Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather. Match Rating: 4/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. The Undertaker
Undertaker always gives spectacular performances at WrestleMania, and with someone talented as Edge as his opponent, we all know that this match was going to be great the second it was booked. And man, it was. It started off fast and exciting, with a lot of powerful moves being used by both wrestlers, with Undertaker doing a variation of the Stone Cold Stunner using the ring rope, and Edge doing the same thing, only as a neckbreaker. At one point, Edge went to the top, but Undertaker knocked him to the outside, causing Edge to flip and just SMACK right on the ground! OUCH! Undertaker then dove out of the ring like he usually does, and nailed Edge with an amazing flying clothesline. Back in the ring, some more sweet spots were pulled, and Edge was actually dominating the match for a good portion of it, even nailing a superplex on Undertaker. Edge countered Old School twice, as well as the Snake Eyes/big boot combination, but Undertaker countered a Spear attempt by Edge. As the match went on, more solid and entertaining wrestling transpired, with Undertaker going for a knee in the corner, but ended up being dumped to the outside. Undertaker hit a Chokeslam on Edge finally, but Edge managed to kick out!!! Undertaker went for the Last Ride, but Edge ended up nailing a neckbreaker out of nowhere! Edge got frustrated and called for the Tombstone Piledriver...and ACTUALLY GOT UNDERTAKER IN THE POSITION! Undertaker countered the move into his own Tombstone and...EDGE KICKED OUT!!! Wow!!! Edge is really becoming a big thing in the WWE, and he's going to be in the Hall of Fame if he keeps putting on extraordinary matches like this. Edge dodged a big boot that hit the referee, and Edge took advantage of this opportunity by hitting Undertaker with a camera he stole from a cameraman on the outside of the ring, even knocking the cameraman flat on his butt! Undertaker still kicked out! Zack Ryder and Curt Hawkins ran out after Undertaker nailed the Last Ride I believe it was, but Undertaker Chokeslammed one of them off of the apron and onto the other one in an absolutely sickening way! This gave Edge the opportunity to nail the Spear...BUT UNDERTAKER KICKED OUT AGAIN! The ending came when Edge nailed yet ANOTHER Spear, but Undertaker countered it out of nowhere into Hell's Gates, and Edge, bleeding profusely from his mouth, ended up tapping out. Phenomenal match. Winner: The Undertaker. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

There was a lot going on at WrestleMania XXIV. There were interviews, musical performances, and appearances by celebrities, including Raven Samone and Snoop Dogg, as well as  Kim Kardashian. Snoop Dogg nailing Santino with a clothesline, and Dogg's interview that also included Mick Foley and Festus as part of the proceedings was pretty entertaining. The Hall of Fame highlights were tearjerking, and Mae Young's appearance was pretty funny. Edge gave a pretty good promo to hype up his match with Undertaker. It all went very smooth and surprise appearances by our favorite superstars was great. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS

The entirety of the Hall of Fame ceremony is included. This is great, though a lot of the speeches just seem to drag on, especially Rocky Johnson's. The Rock's return to the WWE to induct his father was great fun, hilarious, and spine-tingling as he hinted towards ""one more match"", and even expressed interest in wrestling John Cena, Shawn Michaels, Rey Mysterio, and even Stone Cold Steve Austin one more time. Also included on the Extras is the Battle Royal for the #1 contender's spot in the ECW Championship match that took place later that night. Since you know who wins and the thing was just an excuse to get all of the WWE superstars an appearance at WrestleMania XXIV, it's not really that great, though there are some cool spots. Rating: 4/5

OVERALL EVENT

Almost all of the matches were absolutely wonderful. The opening match was a hardcore bout that was very entertaining, while the momentum continued with the always astonishing Money in the Bank ladder match, as well as an impressive battle between Batista and Umaga. The Flair/Michaels match was heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once, plus it was simply a great showing between two of wrestling's biggest stars. The only disappointments were the tag team women's match (though it had its moments), and the ECW Championship match between Kane and Chavo. Big Show/Mayweather was great fun, and both the WWE Championship match and the World Heavyweight Championship match was great. I just can't get enough of John Cena getting pinned.",1247011200,2,16846,4.723223393403604

CM Punk vs. Kennedy vs. MVP vs. Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Chris Jericho (Money in the Bank Ladder Match)

Kane vs. Chavo Guerrero (ECW Championship)...8 seconds or so. Not worth rating but I am cause of the winner.
On a scale of 1-10......................3/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair (Career Threatening Match)....This was a very emotional match from the beginning...At the end where Shawn Michaels is a finally about to put Flair down with a third superkick he says ""Im sorry I love you""...very touching moment....End of a gret career...2nd best match for MOTY in 2008.
On a scale of 1-10............10/10

John Cena vs. Triple H vs. Randy Orton..........(WWE Champioship)...This was good. Not great...Nice spots, like the Tower of Doom and much more...Wrong winner...

Floyd Meriweather  did everythng he needed to do to win, Big show was dominating.

Edge vs. Undertaker (World Heavyweight Championship...Undertaker was robbed out of the Main event spot at Wrestlemania last year..

mitb chris jericho vs shelton benjamin vs john morrison vs carito vs cm punk vs mvp vs mr kennedy this is the best mitb at least to me it is just awesome all the spots and it moved along perfectly but the best spots are morrison's moonsault with a ladder, benjamin's bump on the ladder, matt hardy comin in and his cutter off the ladder on mvp, carlito's back breaker of the ladder, the tower of doom off the ladder and morrison's bump on his crotch 5/5

3076506,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania 24 was the second WM I've seen on PPV (WM23 being the first). I enjoyed it, but I felt it wasn't the best WM I've seen to date.

My Mum got me the limited edition tin case edition of WM24 for my 21st birthday on 13/07. I was going to buy it anyway, so that was a bonus.

First off, I have to commend the WWE for the packaging of the DVD. The tin case is superbly made, the DVDs themselves have a full colour photo on them and the whole thing is gorgeously made. They put a lot of effort into the packaging of the DVD and it shows. As a bonus, a card with a filmstrip of a scene from a past Wrestlemania is included - Shawn Michaels vs Steve Austin. A cool collectable.

Now, onto WM itself. It was a good event, worth the time and money, but in my personal opinion, it wasn't as good as the past few WMs. Let's rundown the matches:

Belfast Brawl: Finlay (w/ Hornswoggle) vs JBL
I was expecting this match to be boring because of JBL, who can't wrestle to save his life, but it was actually really exciting and a good opener to the show (I know the battle royal was the actual opener, but this was the opener on TV). It was great seeing Hornswoggle back and he even got involved. Loads of weapons were involved and there were a few great spots. The only downer was that JBL won. That makes it lose a star. (4/5)

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs John Morrison vs Carlito vs CM Punk vs MVP vs Mr. Kennedy
Another exciting MITB match, I think this one was better then last year's. Highlights included Shelton Benjamin's fall onto a ladder (and Carlito's facial expression afterwards), Matt Hardy running in to stop MVP getting the briefcase and CM Punk and Chris Jericho's fight at the top of a ladder to get said briefcase. CM Punk won and I'm glad. A great match. (5/5)

Battle For Brand Supremacy: Batista vs Umaga
This match was kinda boring. It wasn't up to WM standard and could have been featured on Raw or Smackdown. Speaking of which, Batista won, which means Smackdown is the better brand? I don't think so. Raw has been way better then Smackdown since the beginning of 2008. And Batista was wasted in this match, they could have found a way better match for him. But he won, and that's good. A mediocre match and Batista messed up the Batista Bomb, so that ruined it. (3/5)

ECW Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero (champion) vs Kane
This was the first match for a title, and yes it was only 8 seconds long but it was damn brilliant. I can't stand Chavo, so to see him lose that fast was just hilarious. It was great to see a new ECW champion and the whole thing was just funny. I can't give it a high mark though. (2/5 - just for the funny)

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels
Match of the night, without a doubt. This one was worth the money of the PPV alone. I'm a huge Shawn Michaels fan, so to see him in a huge match such as this was just amazing. I think everybody knew that Ric was going to lose and retire, but it didn't ruin the match. Both men had their strong moments, and I winced when Shawn did the moonsault onto the announce table and cracked his ribs. The moving moment when Shawn mouthed ""I'm sorry, I love you"" made me cry and the standing ovation Ric got after ity was over was a perfect ending. Epic and should have been nearer the end of the card, for sure. This match also lead into a superb feud between Batista, Shawn and Chris Jericho that culiminated in some amazing matches at subsequent PPVs, too. (5/5)

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Maria & Ashley vs Beth Phoenix & Melina (w/ Santino Marella)
w/ Snoop Dogg as the Master Of Ceremonies
Lumberjacks: Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly, Cherry, Jillian Hall, Victoria, Layla, Katie Lea Burchill, Eve Torres & Maryse
I think I'm the only person who didn't think this match was that bad. It was really a match to calm people down after the Shawn vs Ric match right before it. Beth & Melina won, but Maria and even Ashley got in some good offence. Jerry Lawler got involved, taking down Santino and even Snoop attacked him after the match. I would have preferred a Women's Championship match though. (3/5)

Triple Threat Match For The WWE Championship: Randy Orton (champion) vs Triple H vs John Cena
Before I get into the match, how hilarious was John's entrance? He had a whole brass band play his entrance music xD I had no idea who the hell was coming out until his video began to play on the Titantron. The match itself was very entertaining - I find most triple threats/fatal 4 ways to be. Loads of attempted pins and breakups of pins, loads of crazy moves and the such. I was laughing all the way through it. I think most people were surprised that Randy retained though, as most people predicted John to win. Good match though. (5/5)

The Biggest vs The Best: Big Show vs Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather (w/ his HUGE entourage xD)
I was expecting this match to be absolutely horrible, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was rather entertaining. I find Floyd Mayweather incredibly annoying though and I was rooting for Big Show the whole time (so was the crowd I noticed). Show did get offence in on Mayweather that I enjoyed and he even got some of his entourage too. Mayweather won after hitting Show with brass knuckles. It was pretty good for the match containing a celebrity. (4/5)

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge vs The Undertaker
I know some people say this match was predictable considering it was Edge's title vs Taker's reign, but there were moments when I thought that Edge might have actually beat Taker. Especially the Spear, I was on the edge (hah bad pun) of my seat, willing for Taker to kick out. Edge got help from the cronies (Hawkins & Ryder) and overall the match was exciting. Of course the best moment was Taker locking on the submission move and Edge tapping out. Brilliant end to the PPV. (5/5)

Overall, the show was good but not outstanding. Shawn vs Ric, the WWE title match, MITB and the WHC title match were the best matches. Everything else was either good (Show vs Mayweather, Belfast Brawl), ok (Divas), mediocre (Batista vs Umaga) or just funny with how ridiculous it was (ECW title).

Also on the DVD is the 24 Man Battle Royal that Kane won to qualify for the short ECW title match. It was on before WM went to air, and was quite entertaining. I was glad Kane won.

The other thing on the DVD is the 2008 Hall Of Fame induction ceremony. I've never watch the HOF in full before but I wanted to see The Rock and Ric Flair's speech so I watched the whole thing. It was uber long but really entertaining. The Rock is very funny - I laughed when he made fun of Chris Jericho's hair and The Marine (John's face was so funny) xD Ric's speech was both funny and moving.
The one thing I didn't like is how it was on 2 DVDs, half of the HOF was on the 2nd DVD and the other half on the 3rd. It ruined the flow for me.

Overall, a superbly made DVD, a great Wrestlemania and one of the best matches of 08 in Shawn vs Ric. A great buy.",1216080000,6,7046,4.358993902439025
3076507,3,B00124ONF6,The matches were not good at all....it could be better but wwe din't effort themself to the top...i expect that next mania would be better,1215648000,,138,4.56
3076508,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania XXIV was held on Orlando, Florida at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday March 30 2008. It was a great experience, I was there, the best thing was one of the few Wrestlemania ever held on an open field, so that add to the experience.

There are great matches here, but the most notorious, is the one with Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels, that would go down in history as the last match of the Nature Boy Ric Flair.

Also the championship match of Randy Orton, Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match, the second time we have a triple threat in WM history would go down as one of the best matches all around.

The Undertaker vs Edge was a fun match but definitely not one of the best for any of them.

The Money in the Bank Ladder match was also a pretty good match.

The Divas match and the ECW championship match were the two bummers of the night.

This DVD capture the experience very well, as for extras there is the Hall of Fame ceremony, not one of the best but still fun and exciting due to the fact that Ric Flair was been inducted.

If you are a wrestling fan this is a must, you will enjoy this DVD, and if you were there like me, you will remember that Wrestlemania weekend at Orlando, FL. I know I will.",1215475200,,1221,4.1265822784810124
3076509,5,B00124ONF6,i just tell everybody this is the first dvd of wwe that is blue ray and i must tell you its excellent everything you expect it from a blue ray to watch it on play 3 or player with blue ray with an hd tv,1214697600,,202,3.511111111111111
3076510,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania 24 lived up to the hype no doubt about it. A very solid PPV, and the matches all delivered. It would have been nice to have some extras on the disc, because the only extras are the HOF ceremony and the 24 man battle royal. I definately reccomend you to purchase this though.

Belfast Brawl- Finlay vs JBL: A pretty good match with a few bumps. This was definately a brawl. The best spot of the match was when Finaly went diving through the second rope only to get a stiff hit in the head with a trash can lid in mid air. Very good spot. Also a moment that gave me a laugh is when JBL tossed a trash can at Hornswoggle. I must admit though the table was broken in a way that looked like it didn't hurt and i think the match should have introduced a few more weapons. Good match, but could have been better.  3/5 stars

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Excellent match. My favorite MITB match yet. This match had many crazy moments, and I can only imagine how crazy this match would have been with Jeff Hardy being it (but he got suspended). Definately a match i could watch again. Best spot of the match came when Shelton was tossed off a ladder in the ring and landed on a set up ladder on the outside, in which the ladder broke. Crazy moment. But then again many moments where such as: Backstabber off the ladder, Moonsault of turnbuckle with ladder in hand, Sunset Flip Powerbomb/superplex off ladder. Along with many more. Definately a great match.  5/5 stars

Battle for Brand Supremacy- Umaga vs Batista: Decent match, but to be honest what can you expect out of these two? There's not a moment worth mentioning, and the ending came with a very sloppy batista bomb. Ok match but wasn't Wrestlemania worthy. And one thing i don't understand is what was the point of this? How does that prove Smackdown is better? but anyways i give this a 2/5 stars.

ECW Championship- Kane vs Chavo Guerrero: Absolutely Terrible use of ECW. For the first time ever there will be an ECW title match at Wrestlemania, the only bad thing is the match ended in less than 10 seconds (somewhere around 5 or 7 seconds). Horrible way to use ECW and i personally would have liked these two guys to at least have a 10 minute match.  1/5 stars (the reason i give it a star is because of Kane's pyro lol)

Career Threatening Match- Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair: This was no doubt about it match of the night. Very emotional matchup and a very good wrestling match. The match had many counters, and was evenly match. Shawn Michaels goes for a moonsault later on in the match and manages to hit his stomach on the edge of the anouncers table. Looked like that hurt a lot. But this match was very emotional with the fact that Shawn Michaels couldn't seem to finish the job and didn't want to. Finally Ric Flair stands up crying and shouts to Shawn Michaels ""Come On"".. Shawn then utters the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"", then hits a SCM to finish it. That classic finish will definately be talked about for years to come. If you're a Ric Flair fan you will definately be proud of this match.  5/5 stars

Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match- Maria and Ashley vs Beth Phoenix and Melina:  An ok wrestling match, but the real reason they had this match was to really promote Maria's Playboy shoot and to show the sexy divas. Not really much to say about this match besides the lights go off halfway during it and it had a pretty good ending with Snoop Dog clotheslining Santino. Which by the way im marking out for Santino, he's excellent on the mic. 2/5 stars.

WWE title Triple Threat Match- Orton vs Cena vs HHH: Pretty good match with a few good moments, such as the double rope DDT by orton on Cena and HHH. The top rope superplex/electric chair drop was also well done (but then again nothing we haven't seen before right?) well the match was an ok one but i think WWE should have put more time into the match than Cena's entrance -_-. But needless to say i was extremely happy about the ending which is why i give this match a 4/5 stars.

Big Show vs Floyd Mayweather: Pretty Good match. It was anything goes and boy did they take advantage of that. It was good to see Show slam Mayweather a couple of times. As well as Chokeslam a few of his Mayweather's henchman. I just didn't like the fact that Show lost, but then again it was very predictible seeing as a celebrity never loses at Wrestlemania, and not to mention the fact hat Floyd's undefeated. I just don't think Show should have been brought back the way he did. But i guess it was an ok match and the ending was a very solid punch (with brass knucks) which connected perfectly. It looked like it hurt.  3/5 stars.

World Heavyweight Title- Edge vs Taker: I was extremely proud of this match. And this is almost as good as the Flair HBK match. Very Back and Forth match with each superstar hitting numerous finishers and getting close counts. Edge is very talented and i love the way he managed to counter some of Taker's moves in the coolest (sorry for lack of a better word) way. Very unpredictable match and had an awesome ending. What a way to end off Wrestlemania.  5/5 stars

All in all Wrestlemania this year was really good and i reccomend you purchase this DVD. Especially for the Money in the Bank match, Flair vs HBK match, and Taker vs Edge match.",1214611200,,5306,4.38148524923703

3076512,5,B00124ONF6,"My review is going to be a little more different than everyone else's review.

I attended WrestleMania 24, it was a beautiful day, we had some sprinkling rain, 74,000 people live in the sunshine state of Florida.
No matter where you went that day, rather it was hotels, or grocery stores, WrestleMania 24 posters were everywhere.

I brought this DVD and I love it, it reminds me of how special that day was, bigger than the super bowl and any football fan that was there would tell you the same.

But for less than 30 bucks you get 8 hours (4 main event and 4 from hall of event) in HD ! amazing transfer, despite is their first ever blu-ray disk, they did a amzing job, only thing they didn't do too well they lack upgrade their audio, is only 640kb. Transfer is sharp as what it should be. If you had any interest with wwe and own a blu-ray player this is no brainer over regular dvd.  You won't go back to dvd once you see in HD!",1212278400,,484,3.938775510204082
3076514,4,B00124ONF6,"OK.

The title, for those curious, is because everyone else has already talked about the event; regardless of whether I agree or disagree, it's all moot.  I'm here to talk about the Blu-ray and the quality thereof.

The main thing you need to know - THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING.  I dare say it exceeds the HD broadcast version of the event.  Note that this does NOT support 1080p, however do not let that deter you.  1080p is a hype machine designed for the cats with 60 inch plasma screens in custom theaters.  If you've got a 40-50 inch anything, you can set this to 720p and trust me, the quality is as it should be.

The audio quality is decent, but definitely not the most bang for the buck.  No DTS HD.  No 7.1 (probably doesn't affect anyone reading this).  No WMA Pro.  No Master Audio.  Basically, it's plain Jane Dolby Digital 5.1.  I'm miffed at why they short changed the audio at such an event, especially considering it was an outdoor event that could have been significantly enhanced with the presence of HD audio.

The extras are basic fanfare in my opinion, but what stands out is the (somewhat) full Hall of Fame.  The main detractor, and one reason I knocked a point off, is the editing of Ric Flair's speech to take out Benoit's name.  I know WWE doesn't want to associate with someone alleged with killing their family.  However, that doesn't mean we should forget the man he was before he allegedly did what he did.  Ric was talking about the history of Benoit and should have been allowed to speak his piece properly.  To edit it is a travesty.

I was anticipating further edits of the event like they did with Wrestlemania 22 (cutting out Mickie's infamous lick), but no, they left the event mostly intact, even the lighting issues that happened during the event.  I'm a stickler for staying true to the original integrity of events like this, so this was a positive for me.

The other reason I knocked a point off is the price.  There's just no excuse for it.  I mean they bumped up the broadcast price $10 and priced the Blu-ray at the price the PPV used to be at...why?  If I got a guarantee that WWE would release EVERY SINGLE PPV in Blu-ray unedited from this point forward, fine...then it's a choice of watching the PPV right away or waiting for the Blu, just like people do with DVDs now, but I know they won't do that.  Plus this is worth MAYBE $25, not the $40 Amazon wants, and that's low compared to some retailers.

So...is it recommended?  Yes.  Is it overpriced?  Yes.  Does it deliver?  In some ways, yes.",1212192000,2,2551,4.464208242950108
3076515,3,B00124ONF6,"This is the first WrestleMania DVD that I have bought that I am very upset with. Usually the three disc set is Disc 1 & 2 being the event, and alot of extras on disc 2. Then disc 3 is usually the entire Hall of Fame, this year Disc 1 & 2 features the event, and Disc 2 & 3 is the Hall of Fame. The only ""extra"" is the Battle Royal before the event, and I don't even consider that an extra since it was shown on [...] before WrestleMania began. I was going to purchase this DVD no matter what because of the Hall of Fame, as I do every year. Yet the extras always make the dvd a collectable, but this year the WWE did not put alot of effort into this release. I was hoping for extras like Mr. McMahon on the walk of fame, press conference highlights, or even Ric Flair highlights. I hope the lack of extras of Ric Flair shows up on his next DVD release in july.",1211846400,,860,3.92
3076516,5,B00124ONF6,"Belfast Brawl Match: Finlay vs. J.B.L. - This was just a glorified way of saying that this match was a street fight.  With weapons like a chair, trash cans, and Finlay's usual prop (sorry, I can't spell it right if I tried) & the return of Hornswoggle, who got involved at times, this was a very enjoyable brawl & the best performance I've seen from J.B.L. since his return.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. C.M. Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. M.V.P. vs. Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy (sorry, I'm a mark for that) - Anyways, you know that this match is set to be nothing more than a non-stop spotfest and boy was it ever.  Morrison's moonsault off the top rope with ladder in hand & later taking a fall that every man watch felt, Shelton Benjamin's ""tower of doom"" powerbomb off the ladder & his fall out of the ring onto the ladder wedged on the outside, the Walls Of Jericho on the ladder, Carlito's ""backstabber"" off the ladder, and the return of Matt Hardy.  One of the best Money In The Bank's matches yet.

RAW vs. SmackDown: Batista vs. Umaga - This was the first flop of the night as Umaga completely dominated & carried this match (and even had the crowd cheering for him) until Batista blocked the samoan spike & ""unleashed the animal"" with the spinebuster & powerbomb (which he lost his balance doing).  It wasn't as bad as Cena/JBL from WrestleMania 21 but it's basically the same type of match.

ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. Kane - Unfortunally, I blinked during this match & missed the whole thing.  Just kidding but seriously, Chavo's entrance was longer than the match as Kane chokeslammed his way to the first World/Brand Championship in almost 10 years & possibly setting a new WrestleMania record (sorry King Kong Bundy).

Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair - Unfortunally, Ric Flair's matches as of late were just lackluster to average as best but Shawn gave Ric the best match he's had since the 2005 series of matches with Triple H.  This match was an emotional rollercoaster as you saw Ric Flair pulling out some of his old ""dirtiest player in the game"" tricks on HBK throughout the match while HBK was conflicted with ""putting 'Old Yeller' out of his misery"" & even held back from taking Flair out with sweet chin music early in the match.  During one point, HBK returned Flair's slap from RAW & drew ""first blood"" on Flair by making his mouth bleed while later, Flair looked like he was fighting for his life in HBK's figure four & even ripped off the bottom turnbuckle post in the process of trying to get out of it.  However, Flair's career was ended with the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"" & the third sweet chin music.  This was the type of performance that Ric Flair needed to end his career on...and he got it.

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Maria & Ashley vs. Beth Phoenix & Melina - Looking that all the previous ""Playboy"" matches in WM history, I expected the usual boring trainwreck but this match was better than I expected as Beth & Melina showed by they were some of the best female wrestlers in mainstream wrestling today (with some nice doubleteam work) while Maria did a decent job in the ring herself & Ashley was able to not drag the match down unlike last year.  There was a moment when the lights went out and had to put spotlights on the ring but it was still a watchable  match with cameo appearences from Santino Marella, Jerry Lawler, and even Snoop Dogg throwing a clothesline that look better than anything Ashley did.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena vs. Triple H - Before I get started, I liked Cena's entrance with the college band playing his entrance music.  Well, this was the shocker of the night concidering the winner of the match was the person nobody expected just based off 92% of WWE's own poll & a majority the comments in the reviews of Royal Rumble & No Way Out on Amazon itself.  As for the match itself, it was your typical triple threat match in which it was non-stop action with each man having their moments at various times along with the various moments of one man stopping another from winning the match before Orton got the biggest win in his championship reign...and for those trivia fans who like to keep score of this type of thing, this was Cena's first WrestleMania loss & the fourth time a heel has walked out of WrestleMania a World Champion.

Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather - Well this was the best ""worked"" boxing influenced match I've seen in wrestling but concidering how crappy the other ones were, that's not much of a compliment. The match was entertaining for what it was once they got away from trying to make it a look like a real ""shoot"" match & started getting entertaining with Mayweather's crew getting involved at times with chairs & brass knucks coming into play.  Too bad they didn't book Mayweather as the heel in this feud, as he is just a natural in that role, because I got a guilty pleasure out of Big Show chopping & just manhandling him at times.  In the end, this match was like the Billionaries match last year where it was about the the hype of the celebrity appearence to draw money instead of having a high quality match so with that in concideration, this was an entertaining match for what it was...and at least he didn't have to see Big Show in a diaper unlike his celebrity match at WrestleMania 21.

WWE Champion Edge vs Undertaker -  Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually deliveres...and this was no expection.  Edge worked on Taker's back thoughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose.  Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (PLEASE FIND A NAME TO THE HOLD ALREADY!).  As a side note, let's be honest here...did anyone ever think we would see Johnathan Coachman ever calling a WrestleMania main event based off how bad he's been in the past?  I thought he was going to take away from the match with his commentary but props for Coach in putting on a good performance, he wasn't Jim Ross but he was better here & throughout the show than he's usually been in the past.

The only DVD extras here was the entire Hall Of Fame ceremony (spread over two DVD's) inducting The Brisco Brothers, Gordon Solie, Mae Young, and Eddie Graham.  The real highlights though was the return of The Rock to induct his grandfather Peter Maivia & his father Rocky Johnson...but not before roasting various members of the WWE roster to the point to where I had to pause the DVD because I was laughing so hard.  Along with this was the induction of Ric Flair by Triple H including the story of how he met Ric Flair with a baloon & even giving a mention to Michael ""Stay Puff Marshmellow Pimp"" Hayes.  The other was the traditional WrestleMania preshow battle royal which was won by Kane.

In the end, this was the most enjoyable WrestleMania I've seen since 20 as everything was watchable & nothing was so horrible that I would skip over it everytime I watch the event.  This was a 4 star event but the Hall Of Fame & even the battle royal which had it's entertaining moments like Jamie Noble's creative way of getting back in the ring without his feet touching the floor push it up a star.  I highly recommend this WrestleMania event.

Side Note: The Wal-Mart version of this WrestleMania comes with the McMahon DVD.",1211500800,3,7705,4.541907514450867
3076517,5,B00124ONF6,"For the first time in a long time, WWE got it right & delivered an event that was worthy of being called their biggest event of the year as this event really had so much to offer. In fact, I thought this event was better than the last couple WrestleManias including the previous year's card.

Belfast Brawl: J.B.L. vs Finlay. Thank god that I didn't pay any attention to the storyline that started this feud because I would not have cared for it otherwise. Besides that, this was a good opener as this was really just a fancy way of saying that this was a hardcore match as both men brawled & used weapons like trash cans, kendo sticks, steel steps, a table & even Hornswoggle getting involved in the action as this was perhaps J.B.L.'s best match since returning.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs CM Punk vs John Morrison vs Shelton Benjamin vs Carlito vs Mr. Kennedy vs M.V.P.. This was the best one that they have done since the original MIB match as there were just so many spots to mention here along with new ones that we have never seen before. Moments include Shelton's athleticism along with taking a sick fall through a ladder, Morrison doing a moonsault to everyone with the ladder in his hand, Carlito delivering the ""Backstabber"" to Jericho off the ladder, the sunset flip/suplex sequence off the ladder involving Benjamin, Carlito & Kennedy, & Jericho applying ""The Walls"" to Morrison on top of the ladder. Awesome match to watch from start to finish.

Battle for Brand Supremacy: Batista vs Umaga. This was a RAW vs SmackDown interpromotional match but this was really just a decent match at best as Umaga mostly dominated this entire match & even go the crowd on his side before Batista did his usual Hogan/Warrior routine in order to win the match in the end.

ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs Kane. First of all, I just want to say that I don't care about what they do to ECW because the old ECW is long dead. Anyways, that statement was longer than this match as it ended in ten seconds with Kane winning the title.

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels. The stipulation here was that if Flair loses this match, he must retire. This was one of the highlights of this event as this was just an emotional, techincal wrestling match as you can literally see the emotion from both men whether they were trading submission holds or even engaging in their battles of chops to the point where HBK wanted to taunt Flair but out of respect decided not to. The crowd was heavily into this one but it all ended for the Nature Boy after HBK, who was conflicted, decided to the end the whole thing with the third sweet chin music leaving barely a dry eye in the audience as Flair's career was over but not before getting a tremendous ovation on his way out.

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Melina & Beth Phoenix vs Maria & Ashley. Snoop Dogg was the master of ceremonies but this was a much better match than it looked on paper considering the history of these matches really stinking up the joint when it happened at WrestleMania. Although I am sure this match would have been better with the original Candice Michelle being in this match but again, it was better & watchable than I thought it would. However, the highlight for me was seeing Snoop Dogg deliver a great clothesline to Santino which I thought was funny.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs Triple H vs John Cena. For the third year in a row, Cena had a unique entrance with the marching band & while I was not too big on it, I'll give credit for him doing something new. Anyways, this was a good triple threat as it was non-stop action with all three men facing off with one another at one point in time with one moment to look out for would be Triple H using the crippler crossface to Cena. But the real highlight here was the ending was done so well that it shocked everyone in attendance as it was also the person that nobody expected to win...and I mean that in a good way.

The Biggest vs The Best: The Big Show vs Floyd Mayweather. This was a shoot fight where you can only win by pinfall, submission or knockout while the match was changed to a No Disqualification match which really made this a very entertaining match. If you didn't pay a attention to the angle, you would have thought that Big Show was the fan favorite as the crowd supported him & booed Mayweather. In fact, they enjoyed him beating up Floyd which I have to admit that liked as well before Mayweather's people got involved in the match that lead to Floyd winning the match using a steel chair & a brassknockled right hand.

World Champion Edge vs The Undertaker. Even though Flair/HBK may be the match that most fans consider the match of the night, I would go with this one as I thought this was the better quality encounter out of the two. This match started slow but it picked up & got better as time went on that resulted in a great wrestling match between these two as they went back & forth with Edge targeting Taker's back to the point where Edge was able to counter most of Taker's signature moves in so many ways that it looked so impressive that you thought he was going to win at times. Undertaker never fails to deliver a great performance in main event situations as he delivered just like he did last year & was able to overcome the odds (including Edge's sidekicks) with the gogoplata submission hold to win his 6th World Championship & his 16th WM victory.

DVD extras include the battle royal that was played before the event to determine the #1 contender for the ECW Championship which was won by Kane with some entertaining moments including the way that Jamie Noble got back into the ring. The other extra is the entire Hall of Fame ceremony with inductions of Ric Flair, Mae Young, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia & others but the real highlight was seeing the return of The Rock to induct his father & grandfather but also making a few jokes to some of the WWE roster which was really some hilarious stuff worth checking out.

Overall, this was the best WrestleMania that I have seen in years as not only you got two great extras here but the event itself is a quality card that any fan would enjoy.",1211414400,,6209,4.466490299823633
3076518,5,B00124ONF6,"UPDATE 2/10/09:

I recently ordered the Blu-Ray version of this card and let me say as great as it looked on regular DVD, it is BEAUTIFUL on Blu-Ray! If you have a Blu-Ray player or a machine that can play Blu-Ray discs, then its worth it plus its more convenient as you have one disc for the card and one for the Hall Of Fame show!

The review below was mainly on the original 3 disc set:

For me, when I bought this set (which also came with the McMahon DVD as well that came out two years ago), I bought it mainly for Michaels Vs. Flair but I've looked at the whole card and here is my opinion:

JBL Vs. Finlay (Belfast Brawl) - Kind of a weak opener considering that both men are very good brawling wrestlers! JBL comes out on top in this one.

Chris Jericho Vs. Shelton Benjammin Vs. John Morrison Vs. Carlito Vs. MVP Vs. C.M. Punk Vs. Mr. Kennedy (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - Too many high spots to call but I will say this, a couple of them had me cringing in pain, particularly Shelton's fall on the ladder and Morrison's fall on his b*lls from the near top of the ladder onto the top rope! To Morrison, I have one word for you: ICE and plenty of it!

We also see a surprise appearance from Matt Hardy as he prevents MVP from winning the match with a ""Twist Of Fate"" from the ladder. Ends when C.M. Punk ties up Chris Jericho's legs on the ladder and claims the briefcase for himself.

Batista Vs. Umaga (Smackdown Vs. RAW) - Not a great match BUT I've seen a lot worse too. Worth a look or two. Ends when Batista gets in his ""Batista Bomb"" on Umaga, which he nearly botches but manages to correct it in mid-drop to keep Umaga from falling on his head or worse!

Chavo Guerrero Vs. Kane (ECW Championsip Match) - Two words: 12 seconds!

Shawn Michaels Vs. Ric Flair (Career Threatening Match) - The main reason I purchased this set. Even knowing what was going to happen and what did happen afterwards, I found myself nearly in tears again just like the night they held the in-ring tribute on RAW the next night!

As for the match, I wouldn't rate it a 10 BUT it was no lower than an 8. Had this had been Michaels Vs. Ric Flair of the 1980's, then this would've been a 10 without question! As it was, its even more impressive that Flair (at around 60) could still put on a good match. No real words I can write will give this match justice. All I can say is see it and if you are really the sensative type, break out the tissues! It's that emotional!

Maria & Ashley Vs. Melina & Beth Phoenix (Playboy Bunny Lumberjack Match) - Not really worth watching except for the end when Snoop Doggy Dog did a surprisingly good clothsline on Santino Marrello as he was taunting Maria after the match! Even more surprising was seeing Snoop make out with Maria! Hope Snoop cleared that with his wife first! LOL!

John Cena Vs. Randy Orton Vs. HHH (WWE Title Match) - Got to admit, as a former band geek myself from my high school days, I found myself watching Cena's unique entrance in this match. Nice to see.

As for the match, it was good but not great. It was mainly finishers in this match. The surprise of the bout (for me) was seeing HHH break up Cena's STFU on Orton with....THE FREAKIN' CROSSFACE! The fans actually cheered on this one! I, myself, was thinking ""He lost the World title to that hold back in 2004! Wouldn't this be irony if he won the WWE title with the same hold!"" Of course, that didn't happen as Triple H hit his Pedigree move on Cena only to have Orton steal the pin after his punt kick to the head of ""The Game.""

So, as of this WrestleMania, Triple H is still winless since 2004. John Cena has lost his first WM since 2004 and Randy Orton has WON his first WM since 2004! Talk about irony!

The Big Show Vs. Floyd Mayweather - More entertaining than expected. I actually enjoyed this match. Even though he lost at the end, I loved seeing TBS beat the hell out of Floyd and his crew! Ends when Mayweather kicks TBS in his ""manhood"" and uses some brass knuckles to knock him out!

The Undertaker Vs. Edge (World Heavyweight Title Match) - This was Edge's first main event and let me say he showed he belonged there. I love The Undertaker BUT I have to give credit where its due....EDGE KICKED HIS A**! Sorry but its true though I am glad to see UT could pull it out at the end! Ends when UT catches Edge in his gogoplata chokehold for the submission after a lengthy bout dominated mostly by ""The Rated R Superstar."" Great way to end WM.

This set also has the Hall Of Fame ceremony. I haven't watch that yet but I'll come back and update my review once I've looked at it. Great purchase!",1211414400,8,4617,4.240318906605922
3076519,5,B00124ONF6,"I'm not going to go into great detail about the card of the  night because I'm pretty sure most know what it was by now.  I will say besides a few duds, it was a great card.  I will go as far as to say that it is the best Wrestle Mania since the days of Stone Cold and The Rock headlining the main event.

I'm mainly here to talk specifically about the Blu-Ray version.  This is by far one of the best looking, clearest, most colorful Blu-Rays I have seen yet.  I don't have HD cable so I watched WM24 in standard def.  After watching it on Blu-Ray, it was almost unbelievable on how much more detail the Blu-Ray version had.  I was able to see bruises and cuts on superstars that I was not able to do in SD.  Everything just had almost a three dimensional ""pop"" to it.  Something worth noting that it is only in 1080i(in which I it was viewed from a 57"" 1080i HDTV in my case)but it is so incredibly crisp, I don't see how you would notice.  I've viewed atleast 30-40 Blu-Rays since getting my PS3 and WM24 is easily at the top of the list.

So the video quality(You know, one of the main reasons to get the Blu-Ray version) is easily rated 5 stars IMO.

Other than that, it's an amazing pay per view regardless if it has a few matches that aren't that great.  Just having Ric Flairs historic last match on here makes this worth the price of admission alone.",1211328000,4,1359,4.137404580152672

3076522,5,B00124ONF6,"Watching this Wrestlemania was a joy. to me there was only one sub par match on the card and it was still descent. i guess i'll go match by match like everyone else.

finlay vs jbl- one of the better hardcore brawls we've seen in sometime. trash cans, kendo sticks, cookie sheets, steel steps were all used and this was the right match to open with. could of gone a little longer but was fun while it lasted and i loved the ending unlike a lot of people. fun match.

money in the bank- this one never disappoints and i thought this years was the best. i don't understand alot of people saying it's the weakest of them all. tons of action, killer spots, a great return of a missed superstar and a great ending with the right guy winning. this match ruled.

batista vs umaga- this was the one kind of letdown. neither guy seemed overly inspired although umaga looked to be trying hard. big dave just seemed kind of off and i thought the powerbomb at the end was great even if it seemed a little botched. it still looked powerful and made sense given umagas size.

kane vs chavo- kane gets his moment, he deserves it. quick, no complaints as i don't think it would've been a good match otherwise.

ric flair vs shawn michaels-the best match of the night, hands down. great story, great wrestling, off the chart emotion. this will be a big wrestlemania moment forever. kudos to vince for letting flair go out on the grandest stage of them all with the best there is going right now. this match was incredible and the end was perfect. the cameras were spot on getting both guys and setting the incredible emotion in the ending of that match. nice touch for everyone to just shut up and watch flair walk that aisle for the final time. this is worth buying the dvd for alone. incredible.

the bunnymania match- a good cooldown match. i even enjoyed it. they tried hard and didn't screw anything up. it wasn't a mat classic but everything they did was well executed and they didn't even blink during the power failure. ashley still is pretty bad. maria did pretty good and the heel team were both good. not bad at all.

cena vs triple h vs orton- i loved this triple threat match. fast paced. some new inventive spots and i love how the match ended and who won. a great triple threat match and a great match period. the 2nd best wrestlemania triple threat just a hair behind wm 20.

big show vs mayweather- i expected an atrocity. whoever booked this deserves a huge bonus. this match was entertaining and turned out being ten times better than i ever thought it could be. mayweather sold like a pro and big show looked great here. fun match.

edge vs undertaker- glad this went on last as i think taker should've been in the last match at wm 23 coming off his royal rumble win. him and edge go on to have a hell of a match. started off slow and built it into a great match. the final ten minutes were great and i loved the ending. taker breaking out a suprise and something new. the perfect ending to an incredible wrestlemania.

i hope to be there in person next year but this wrestlemania comes highly recommended. a very solid and entertaining four hours. my only complaint is we watched it in hd which is widescreen and the release info says fullscreen. i'm hoping that's a typo. it was shown in high def widescreen so the dvd should be widescreen too. that's just a personal gripe though. don't pass this one up though. it's a hell of a show.

EDIT: The WWE did the right thing and released this dvd in a spectacular quality 16x9 widescreen transfer which was one of the things that was greatly debated before release. I won't review it again but watching it a second time just brought back the memory of what a great event it was. An excellent wrestlemania. I can only imagine how great the blu-ray version looks but this dvd looks great as well and is in glorious widescreen. Kudos WWE!",1208995200,2,3886,4.405857740585774
3076523,5,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania is now one of those shows that even if you're no longer a wrestling fan you'll check it out or at least talk about it. Most every person can say they were once a fan of wrestling, either when they were a child or are still wrestling fans but slightly ashamed to admit it. Wrestlemania gives you that platform to look into the past and remember the good old days of your childhood and remember your first Wrestlemania. Over the 24 years of its existence it's given us some big memories that we will never forget and this year is no exception.

Match Card:

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield vs Finlay Belfast Brawl Match: This was basically a no DQ match with a fancy name, Hornswoggle who we had learned the week before was actually the son of Finlay and JBL was out to defend the McMahon family name by getting revenge on his behalf. It had some back and forth action to which the crowd were split, some behind Finlay & some behind JBL, even Hornswoggle had his fans. Good opener I thought.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: CM Punk vs Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs John Morrison vs MVP vs Carlito vs Mr Kennedy. Of the 3 years it had already taken place, the MITB match had left its own mark and now has become a fan favourite. The winner of the match gets a shot at the WWE heavyweight title anytime over the next 12 months. This match had the usual high risk stunts and botches, which made it an edge of your seat match which became quite enjoyable.

Batista vs Umaga: I didn't watch this one

Kane vs Chavo Guerrero: ECW Championship too short to even discuss

Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair Retirement Match: This was a genuine tear jerker as this could possibly be Ric Flairs last ever match. It was very back and forth with the trademark moves taking place but the match was wholly around the emotion and it's something that will stay in our minds for years to come.

Beth Phoenix & Melina W/Santino Marella vs Maria & Ashley Playboy Bunnymania Luberjack Match: Snoop Dogg was the special announcer for this match and it was truly a match befitting for a man like this. I didn't really pay attention to the actual match.

Randy Orton vs Triple H vs John Cena: WWE Championship Match: This was a hugely hyped match and was truly the centre point  for the whole event, Cena had returned from injury to win the Royal Rumble event and challenge the champ at the Wrestlemania Main Event.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Big Show: Now when it comes to headline matches you can't really say anymore about this match as the participants alone make you interested and make the purchase price for the PPV worth it and definitely the DVD price. There were rumours that Mayweather was paid $20 Million to participate in this event but the whole marketability for this match I'm sure made this worth it for the WWE. There were people in my work place who had never watched wrestling before and they were talking about this match and the buildup so it was definitely something special.

Undertaker vs Edge: World Heavyweight Championship. The title wasn't the only thing on the line as the Undertakers 15 - 0 undefeated streak was also on the line. It was a very back and forth match and was, at times very hard hitting.

Overall it was a good show and something that you should get on DVD especially for the HOF ceremony that took place the night before which would have you in tears with Ric Flairs acceptance speech.",1208649600,,3413,4.487096774193549

Why tha F*** did he put Bunnymania and show vs maywheater after RIC AnD HBK!nothing against edge and taker,or cena,orton and hhh but i think Ric vs HBK was the best match of the night and should have been main event,I mean Ric Flair wrestled 4 36 years and his match was in Midcard????Bunnymania should have started the shown,damn it.

3076527,5,B00124ONF6,"This set would be worth your money even if the Ric Flair v. Shawn Michaels match was the only match on it.

Add to that the fact that there were other good matches as well, (most notably Edge v. The Undertaker, The Big Show v. Floyd ""Money"" Maywether, and the Money in the Bank match), and that you get the entire Hall of Fame ceremony on the 3 disc version, (including Ric Flair's unedited induction speech that clocked in at almost 90 minutes and was said to be amazing), and you'll see that you'd be getting a great deal even at twice the price.

3076528,5,B00124ONF6,"As Wrestlemania 24 was getting closer I couldn't help to think that it wasn't going to be that great. Well, I'm glad to admit I was totally wrong. Wrestlemania 24 was not only great but it was full of emotion and it was very close of being flawless. For me, a 30 year old guy who's been a fan for 20 + years not only of WWF/E but also NWA (WCW), AWA, WWC, WCCW, ECW, etc, this Wrestlemania was one of the best ever.
By far and without a shadow of a doubt the best match of the evening was The Nature Boy Ric Flair against the Showstopper Shawn Michaels. As the match was coming to an end I couldn't help to drop some tears as I (and everyone watching) was able to see how history's been written. Hats off to Ric Flair and HBK for giving a magisterial performance.
Another match I enjoyed very much was the Money in the bank match, even though I wanted Chris Jericho to win. I'm not a big fan of watching wrestlers putting their body's on the line like that (don't get me wrong, I loved the old ECW) but I'll have to admit it was very very entertaining. 5 stars!
Well, I hope WWE events continue to have the same impact as this Wrestlemania. All matches were from Ok to amazing. The only 2 matches that I didn't enjoy were the Bunny mania and the ECW title match.
Enjoy a piece of history!",1207353600,,1288,4.135458167330677
3076529,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania was a pretty good ppv, there were a few miss steps but still pretty good. Could be the best Wrestlemania in 5 years. This also was the first Wrestlemania being officially outside since Wrestlemania IX which was cool to see.

1. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield vs. Finlay- Belfest Brawl
This was a good choice to start off the grand daddy of them all. some very hard head shots with cooking sheets and trash cans and one vicious shot to jbl with the sheila leigh from finlay. a table also comes into play and the ending was appropriate to me. 3.75/5

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Chris Jericho vs. Kennedy vs Cm Punk vs Shelton Benjanmin vs. MVP vs Carlito vs John Morrison
This was a spectac match, it wasn't all the way spectacular, but it was a very spectact match. morrison did some crazy stuff with the ladder i've never seen before in my life, you will be impressed by this match. i don't know what happened to jeff hardy in this match but somebody will come back to shock you for his absence. a very spectac match. 4.75/5

3. Batista vs. Umaga in Raw vs. Smackdown
This match reminded me of the Goldberg/Lesnar match from wrestlemania xx. it went very slow and too much ""big-ness"" in the ring. there were some nice big impact moves however but nothing really exciting in this one. 2/5

4. Ecw World Championship
Chavo Guererro vs. Kane
Kane hits the chokeslam on chavo and wins the ecw title in under 10 seconds, so... haha. 1/5

5. Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels
Probably the most emotional match of not this wrestlemania, but in wrestlemania history. it told an outstanding story throughout the match. you will see why hbk is called mr. wrestlemania in this match and you will also see why ric flair is the greatest wrestler ever. in my opinion this was the match of the night. heart felt match all the way but an outstanding match as well. 5/5

6. Bunny Maina Lumberjack Match
Maria and Ashley vs. Beth Pheonix and Melina
this match did not catch my attention whatsoever. very boring to me. but boy old boy i certainly miss seeing trish and lita at a wrestlemania. King does give santino a punch for his pressence, that was pretty funny. 1/5

7. WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Randy Orton vs. Triple H
many people wasn't really expecting this match to give anything special but overall it was pretty good . orton and triple h are great wrestlers, no doubt about it, so to me they gave the match some special-ness to it. everybody had their chance to showcase their ability. it did get pretty fierce in the beginning. i did not expect the ending though, thats for damn sure. pretty good match. 4.5/5

8. Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather
this match was decent to me. not anything special to me besides the ending but it just wasn't your ""typical"" wrestling match. too much interference and big show not really showing mayweather what he can do in the ring. i also did not like the outcome whatsoever either but oh well. But some good quality entertainment right here. 3.5/5

9. World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
now this match is what a wrestlemania match is all about. there was everything in this match from counters to submissions to close pin falls just everything. edge has really turned into a superior superstar and i was  very impressed to see him hang toe to toe in there with the undertaker. a great wrestlemania main event, unlike the past 2 or 3. tremendous match to end the show.(16-0). 5/5

Wrestlemania was great. I recommend this when released on DVD.",1207267200,,3497,4.5792
3076530,5,B00124ONF6,"This was by far the best Wrestlemania...perhaps I'm biased because I was actually THERE on the floor (and also at the Hall of Fame Ceremony the night before), but the overall caliber of matches has been far higher than those of the last three to four Wrestlemanias.  Pretty good considering that it rained there the majority of the time during the event!

I'm not going to go into detail on every match, but I will admit I was torn on which one stole the show.  It's a toss up between the Money in the Bank ladder match and Ric Flair's final match (the sole reason I flew almost 4000 miles to Orlando).  The MITB had some of the best spots I've seen in a match in a long time, and the retirement match...well it's up there simply for the ending...its historic.  I can now tell my kids when they grow up and get into wrestling that their dad was at Ric Flair's final match as well as his induction into the Hall of Fame.

And I'm not ashamed to say it, I cried at the Hall of Fame and I cried after the match...I'm sure anyone who was there would say it too.

I can't wait for the DVD.  Hopefully I can go to Wrestlemania next year in Houston...we shall see.  In the meantime, most definately five stars.",1207094400,,1203,4.241228070175438

UMAGA V. BATISTA- ok heres the deal this match was so anticipated i was soo exited for this match 2 beasts go at it....it was boring. no exiting pints in the match and all it was, was umaga winning the whole match untill batista hit an ugly batista bomb. not very good. 5.5/10

ecw championchip match: CHAVO(c) V. KANE- haha idk what happend i just staired at the tv, i blinked and it was over..scinse its kane tho i was happy. 5/10(i would of gave it 0 but kane won so o well)

carrer threataning match: RIC FLAIR V. SHAWN MICHEALS- ok we all knew flair was going to loose but im happy it was like this. it was a great match and old style wrestleing match. however as much as i hate to say it shawn kind of carried flair throughout the match even tho he hurt his back. an awsome match and i liked the ending even tho some didnt. 9/10

BUNNYMANIA: um idk y they make these kind of matches. if there going to make a womans match make it a tittle match or somthing. best part was the lights turning on haha. 3/10

WWE CHAMPIONCHIP MATCH:RANDY ORTON(C) V. JOHN CENA V. TRIPLE H- ok this is were things started to pick up. this was the most hyped up match it was a good match in the beggining and had so me exiting moments however it was to short and had a bad ending however im kind of happy orton won no one expected it. 8/10

FLOYD ""MONEY"" MAYWEATHER V. THE BIG SHOW- this was a fun match to watch a lot of quick moves by mayweather. I wasn't expecting the big show to hit mayweather as much as he did. very entertaining. 8/10

WOLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIOONCHIP:EDGE(c) V. THE UNDERTAKER- FINALLLY!!! smackdown the better brand of the wwe, yup i said it, was the main event and im happy it was. this waas definatly the match of the night i loved every minute of it. i think these guys put on a show. i was expecting the undertaker to carry edge the whole match but edge did awsome. im also happy the headgeheads didn't interfear that much it was a match u had to stand up for. it mad my heart jump at some points. 10/10

this mania was ok i would buy it only for the last match and somemore hate to see flair go and awsome lights and pyro.i think its a buy!!",1206921600,,2770,4.158878504672897
3076532,4,B00124ONF6,"The 24 man battle royal for the second Smackdown world title was first. Its t$he ECW title but I refuse to call it that. Kane wins.

JBL VS Finaly: A decent match. It would have been a logical Wrestlemania choice to have Hornswoggle come back in the end and assisst Finaly in the win. I guess writers were on vaction at Disney World. Hornswoggle comes out with Finaly instead. JBL win in a match that could be shown on Raw or Smackdown.

Money in The Bank: The highlight of every show since it was introduced. This match is not a match at all; It gets it share of highlights but thr matches always come off sloppy and you lose track of whats going on with certain wrestlers. The ladder they used seemed weake and wouldn't hold u in a few spots. Matt Hardy returns to attack MVP is a highlight. CM Punk wins, I wonder if he is still in the dog house now.

Batista VS Umaga: I love Batista but this match was pointless. It could have been on Raw or Smackdown.

Kane VS Chavo Guerrero: A pointless match and it buried ECW even more. Sandman, Raven, Team 3-D, Rhino, and other ECW aluminis should have stormed the ring and beat the crap out of both men. Remember when Diesel won the world title in 8 seconds ans then almost put WWE out of buisness? His feud with Mabel? Point is, Kane just put the final nail in ECW'S coffin. CM Punk is going to Raw and its already top heavy with talent.
I'm sure Kane will have feuds with Big Daddy V, Mark Henry, and Great Khali on ECW will be five star classics.

Ric Flair VS HBK: HBK and Flair put on a classic match. You had to be there to feel the emotion that was going in the match and thru out the crowd. Awesome match that will be a highlight for years to come.

Bunnymania: The lights went out during this match. Was it power or God saying NEXT!

HHH VS John Cena VS Randy Orton: I had no idea who would win this match. Thats why I was looking foward to this one. I like being surprised and surprise, Orton wins! A rematch at the next PPV im sure.  A very good match with Orton retaining the title in the end. I consider that a surprise.

Money Mayweather VS Big Show: I could careless about this match. This is the reason why some people bought this PPV. Mayweather wins via knock out and left room for a rematch. Oh boy.

A spoiler to WWE fans: TNA'S Ron Killings recently wrestled a dark match for WWE. I don't know if they signed him but it would have been great to have him come out and help Mayweather. Im sure the Orlando TNA crowd would have loved it.

The Undertaker VS Edge: With tha Raw title not changing hands, you knew 'Taker would win. I thought this was a classic and showed how great Edge could be. Im glad they put Smackdown in the main event. Raw may have by far the most talent, but Smackdown works its arse off and can put on excellent matches. A must see. Hopefully Undertaker won't get injuried during this run with the title.

Overall, a solid show. HBK VS Flair and Undertaker VS Edge were classics. A few pointless matches (ECW title, Bunnymania, and Umaga VS Batista) but still worth checking out.",1206921600,5,3066,4.240137221269297

3076534,5,B00124ONF6,"This is Wrestlemania 24. I almost didn't order it live because last year wasn't great and I didn't think it would be worthwhile.
My god, am I glad I did not miss it!

First of all, the open air style gave the show a certain quality and largesse I was only used to when watching old tapes of WM 3, for instance.
The opener was a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and JBL. I don't know if these two had a story together, at least it wouldn't be my favourite pairing. And ""Belfast Brawl"" is just another term for ""Hardcore Match"", which itself is just another term for ""ECW Light"". But anyway, as an opener it had enough punch to shake the audience a bit. Boring finale, though.
After a short interview with Mr. Kennedy, who announced he's going to be the first-ever WWE star to win two consecutive MITB Ladder Matches in a row, which is not THAT much of an achievement anyway, the seven contestants for the suitcase entered - MVP, John Morrison, CM Punk, Mr. Kennedy, Carlito, Chris Jericho and Shelton Benjamin.
Is it just me, or do always the same guys compete every year? You could almost think Vince McMahon wants to say ""Well, these guys could theoretically become World Champions, but unfortunately they suck quite badly.""
When Jericho came out, I though this was a farce, of course he's going to win! Guess what? He didn't. After the usual back and forth, and also some  quite cool new moves with the ladders, Jericho gets trapped in the ladder and CM Punk grabs the suitcase.
I foresee doom ...

I also expected doom in the ECW Title match between Chavo Guerrero and Kane, who won the Battle Royal earlier on. Fortunately, WWE decided to spare the audience some stiff wrestling and ended the match in circa ten seconds. Kane suddenly appeared in the ring, chokeslammed Chavo and won the belt.
I don't even care anymore what the hell they do to ECW, seems to me like it has become a home for stranded superstars.

Next on the card was Batista Vs. Umaga. I have absolutely zero idea why Umaga was still pushed as the big bad monster before this match, the guy has lost weight and is now more than slightly inferior to Batista, as far as the body constitution is concerned; the wrestling skills of both men on the other hand are equally meager.
And I didn't get the storyline behind it, since I don't watch the weekly shows. Apparently some branding rights were on the line, and for a split second I felt transported back in time, into the days when the RAW Vs. Smackdown angle was on its death bed.
The match was exactly like would have expected. Just under ten minutes, power wrestling, and a victory for Batista.

A promo was played for the Carreer-ending match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels, followed by the actual match.
Was I the only one? Was I the only one who cried afterwards? I can't have been the only small boy in front of a television screen, watching the first ever match between Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair back in 1993. I can't have been the only boy who was glued to the TV late at night, much to the distress of my parents, watching Ric Flair style 'n profile. Back in the days when everything was real, when everything was grand, fascinating and enticing.
Even in WCW's darkest hour, Ric Flair transcended the whole misery, gracing every match he was in.
Surely I wasn't the only one who felt that!
The match itself was irrelevant, it was wrestling like we love it, with intensity, tension and above all passion; what really matters, and what grabbed me and the audience by the heart was the ending. Before super-kicking Flair to the final pinfall, Shawn looked into his face and repeatedly said ""I'm sorry"". Even before Charles Robinson (of course he would officiate Ric Flair's last match!) started the count, you could see that Flair broke character and started to break out in tears. Immediately after the three-count, Michaels moved close to his face and told him something we will probably never know.
As Flair moved around the ring crying, thanking the audience, kissing his children, who also wept, the crowd applauded and I could not hold myself back.
And thus, the era Flair was ended.

Even now, in his declining years, Flair was able not only to overshadow the grandest stage of them all, but also to create the first true, historic Wrestlemania moment since many, many, many years!
Having been introduced into the Hall Of Fame the night before, the moment to end the carreer couldn't be more perfect.
Thank you, Ric, from the bottom of my heart! For your passion, your skills - you will never be forgotten!

There was no way anything could come even close to this experience, so WWE put the ""Bunnymania Lumberjill"" Tagteam Match on the card next.
The divas came out, accompanied by Snoop Dogg, so you knew what to expect, and I will not comment any further.
WWE just needs to realise that if someone wants girls to jiggle around with funny moves in sexy dresses, you'll be better advised to rent a softcore porno.

I was a wee bit surprised that the Three-Way Match for the WWE Championship was not the main event.
John Cena's theme song was performed live by some local capella, I assume, and it was so crippled that I didn't even recognise it at first. Apparently, neither did the audience, which is a shame because I love the sudden burst of Boos when the first strains play.
Triple H and Randy Orton were somehow underdogs in my mind, I really expected Cena to win yet again. The match was as good as a WWE Triple Threat currently gets, it was very good, actually. You could have wished for a better build-up to the finale, but apart from this little dent, it was a four star matchup; also because Cena actually didn't win.

Big Show Vs. Floyd Mayweather was in my eyes a positive surprise. It was entertaining, funny, tight and believable. Ironically, Mayweather has more charisma than many musclemachines that pass off as superstars in WWE today.

Now the main event. Purely on paper, Undertaker Vs. Edge doesn't sound very promising. And in the first third of the match, you had every right to fear the worst, since it meandered along quite slowly. Fortunately, things picked up pretty soon and it became a very good match. Whether it was worthy of a WM main event, that's a debatable point, but it was leagues better than 90% of WWE's PPV main events last year.
Since Taker was injured shortly after he won the title at WM 23, he had every right to reclaim the title tonight, and so he did.

The event closed with a stunning firework over, outside and in the bowl. The reason I give this event five stars is not because of the matches, also not because of the title matches, but simply because Ric Flair's ended carreer alone justifies the existence of the WM. It will be remembered; it had a fantastic atmosphere; the matches ranked from okay to very good; and Ric Flair finally and truly acquired immortality, which will make this event legendary.",1206835200,3,6892,4.57246963562753

Belfast Brawl
JBL vs Finlay

Hornswaggle came back with Finlay. Those two put on a very good brawl. They used a table, trash can lids, steel step, and the sheligh. The both of them took some hard shots with the trash ncan lids. Very good opener but I wished Mr. Mcmahon was there because it really didn't fell reight without him. But good. Overall 8.5/10

Money in the Bank Ladder match
Shelton Benjamin, Chris Jericho, MVP, CM Punk, Carlito, John Morrison, and Mr. Kennedy .............. Kennedy!!!

This was not the best Money in the bank match but it was still okay. Shelton took a huge crash through the ladder like hardy and edge last year. It really looked like MVP was going to win but, Matt Hardy made his return and twist of fated him off the ladder. It got good towards the end but I was disappointed with the winner but oh well. Overall 7.5/10

Raw vs Smackdown
Umaga vs Batista

This was not good as expected. Pretty much Umaga dominated Batista through out the match until Batista came back towards the end and spinebuster and a horrible batista bomb. Bad match. Overall 3.5/10

ECW Championship match
Chavo Guerro vs Kane
Heres what exactly happens. Kane sneaks up behind him and chokes slam him and 1,2,3 your new champion. The big red machine Kane. Overall 5/10 , 10/10 for Kane finally wining a major championship.

Ric Flair vs Shawn MIcheals

These two put on one of tonights exciting match but also a emotional one. Shawn tried to do a moonsault to Flair but missed and possibly broke his ribs. I was very surprise with Flair because it must have been over a 20 minute match and He kept in the there. The both of them put out some loud chops to. I was very glad that Flair had his last match at Wrestlemania because he put on one of the greatest matches at Wrestlemania. It also got very emotional after the match. Overall 10/10

Bunnymania Lumberjill match
Maria and Ashley vs Beth Phoenix and Melina

This was a bad follow up to a fantastic match but oh well. This was even worst than Umaga vs Batista. It did look like they tried but didn't try hard enough. Plus the lights went out towards the middle of the match which was horrible. After the match was sort of funny with snoop dogg close lining Satino. Overall 2/10

Triple Threat Match
WWE Championship match
John Cena vs Triple H vs Randy Orton

Cena comes out with a drum line band which was preety nice. This wasn't like the triple threat at Wrestlemania 20 but it was good enough to watch. Orton did a double ddt to the both of them which was cool. Cena tried a double fu but they revered that. It was kind of strange because I knew Cena was going in there with a mixed reaction from the crowd but he is also the only one who got a reaction from the crowd. Good match. Overall 7.5/10

NO DQ match
Big Show vs Floyd Maywheather

At first I thought this was going to be a bad match but it wasn't . It was way better than the Bunnymania and Raw vs Smackdown matches. It stared out slow but really picked up. I was very excited when Big Show dished out pain towards Floyd and his crew. He gave out slams,  chops,  elbow,  chokeslams, and etc. All of a sudden hes hit with a chair and brass knuckles. Still very good of a surprise match. Overall 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship match
The Undertaker vs Edge

This was the most intensed match I have ever seen. Going into the match it really looked like taker was going to loose at Wrestlemania which would start a riot. Edge countered every single move Undertaker tried to do. It got very heart pounding towards the end when Undertaker hit the tombstone and the referee was running to the ring. Undertaker wins out of nowhere when Edge speared Undertaker and turned it into a gogoplata to make him tap out. I'm really glad they put this match last because taker deserved that because of last year. Tie Match of the night with Flair and Micheals. Overall 10/10.",1206835200,3,3988,4.451923076923077

Although my hopes weren't too high for this years ""Showcase of the Immortals"" as the build up wasn't very well done in my oppinion, for a Wrestlemania anyway. Was it a good PPV? Answer: Yes, it was a BRILLIANT PPV! A good Wrestlemania? Well, for the most part, yes. A solid 4.5/5 in my oppinion. Now let's have a look at the matches while staying completely spoiler free.

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield VS Finlay (w/Hornswoggle) in a Belfast Brawl
-It seemed suitable to open the show with this match as I always had fears the fans interest would wan during it. JBL is quite boring in the ring, and while I love Finlay as a wrestler, he isn't completely ""over"" yet. So I feared this match would be met with silence. Opening the show prevented that as it meant everything was freash for the fans. Unfortunately the match sucked. After the most build up out of any match (It dated all the way back to last year and the whole ""Who is Vince's son?"" angle), the most emotional storyline... we got, well we got nothing really. The ""brawl"" was nothing. Finlay's emotion leading up to WM was wasted. The match completely failed it's purpose.

CM Punk VS Shelton Benjamin VS Chris Jericho VS Carlito VS Montel Vontavious Porter VS Mr. Kennedy VS John Morrison in a Money in the Bank ladder match
-Good bump showcase. Not as good a match as previous years, but some awesome bumps. Seemed a bit unorganized though. Still, the winner truly deserved it, even if he was underused in the match. Shelton takes a bloody killer bump. I shared the same expression Carlito wears when it happened.

Umaga VS Batista
-This match didn't stand out at all. I don't think it was expected to though. Easily could've been done on a usual PPV or RAW/SD. Not WM worthy.

Kane VS Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW Championship
-Really, there was no one else that would've won this. And it's revealed early in the night so I don't consider it a spoiler. Kinda odd they didn't show the hyped on TV battle royal, but then again, WWE doesn't make sense often. Quick match, pretty pointless.

Ric Flair VS HBK in a career threatening match
-What an emotional match. Longtime wrestling fans are sure to be overcome with emotional during this match. A fantastic story is told in the ring, backed up solid ringwork. Besides the Money in the bank, this is the only other match so far that has had that unique WM feel.

Beth Phoenix and Melina VS Maria and Ashley in a Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjill match
Lumberjills: Cherry, Eve Torres, Michelle McCool, Victoria, Mickie James, Jillian Hall, Katie Lea Burchill, Kelly Kelly, Layla and Maryse.
-I took a toilet break at the start of the match as I knew this match would be crap. A boring match made worse by a mishap during the match. Only worth watching for Snoop Dogg's entertainment. He's one cool cat.

HHH VS Randy Orton VS John Cena in a Triple Threat match to retain the WWE Championship
-The match was, alright. Didn't really tickle my fancy but I can see some people really enjoying it. Just fast forward John Cena's entrance... it's some goofy marching band entrance. Ergh! The end is quite unexpected and was well done.

Floyd Mayweather, Jr. VS The Big Show in a No Disqualification match
-This match was way better than I expected. Slow, but it had a big feeling to it. Which I found impressive, that they gained that bigtime feeling. A real shocking ending. Pure wrestling fans will despise it, but it's more entertaining than expected.

The Undertaker VS Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship
-THIS is what Wrestlemania is about! What a main event! It had the big feeling to it and truly gave off the feeling anything can happen. The false finishes, reversals, everything was done beautifully. This match saved the show from being a 3 star Mania, to making it a 4-4.5 star mania!

As for the promo's and backstage segments... they were alright. Some entertaining ones. They all pretty much added to the WM feeling.

...Also, it looked SPECTACULAR in High-Def!!!
If possiable it should be watched in HD!

Every current wrestling fan should watch this, to see what the Mania ""feeling"" is. Because by the main event, the show is oozing that bigtime feel. Past fans... watch it for the classic Flair/HBK match and Edge/Taker match (Both 4- 4.5 star matches in my oppinion). Plus you get several good 3- 4 star matches. Skip the belfast brawl (which could've been good, considering the 2 wrestlers are excellent brawlers) and the Diva match.

The DVD/Blu-ray should also come with the Hall of Fame ceremony which makes this a worthy buy as we see the end of an era.

3310949,4,B00124ONF6,"JBL vs Finlay: JBL deserved an ass kicking as much as Mayweather deserved one. Finlay does have control through the match but Hornswoggle being with him and he loses focus, when he has JBL down with his move he doesn't go for the pin because he was to lay out a beating more. JBL wins with the closeline from hell eventually.

  Money in the Bank: I think Jericho should've won this one but in the end on the ladder it comes down to him and C.M Punk. Punk gets the better of the battle on top of the ladder and gets the win. I'm not sure if he has a chance of being champ on Smackdown or Raw though. But he was probably just the 2nd choice to win, Jeff would've won if he didn't get suspended.

  Umaga vs Batista: Yes Batista vs Undertaker was a good match for Batista but he just was pretty bad here. So bad that Umaga was the one the crowd wanted to win. I mean they actually booed when Batista blocked the Samoan Spike. I'm not an Umaga fan but here, sadly he came off as if he was the more talented of the 2. Umaga carries the match and Batista just hits a spine buster and then the Batista bomb for the win, honestly that's about all he did. Yes Batista is strong but that's all he is. If he ever had talent, it's all gone. I mean when he versed MVP, he did 3 spine busters in a row before the Batista Bomb. The spine buster and the Batista Bomb are the only moves he knows of late, even Goldberg could do more than that lol. So this was one of the weaker matches.

  Kane won the battle royal earlier on WWE.com so he verses Chavo but it's no match. Chavo waits for Kane to come to the ring and Kane appears behind him chokeslams him for the win. Kane is finally a 2 time world champ after like a 10 year wait for another reighn. Hopefully this one lasts longer.

  Ric Flair vs HBK: This is no doubt the best match of the night, well best actual wrestling match anyway. HBK goes for Sweet Chin Music in the beginning but he can't do it and Flair gets the figure four on him but HBK gets out. This is a good long technical match for Flair that we haven't seen him in for awhile. He gets close to winning a few times but Shawn hits Sweet Chin Music, doesn't make the cover and Flair gets up and gestures for Shawn to keep fighting and gets hit with it again after Shawn says he loves him. This time he pins him and kisses him on the head and leaves. Flair leaves after hugging his family and walks away to many cheers.

  The Playboy tag match: I'll just say Santino interferes by grabbing Maria's leg and Jerry punches him. But the distraction causes Maria to get pinned by the Amazon after her move. Santino celebrates but gets closelined by Snoop Dog lol, then Snoop kisses Maria.

  Cena vs Triple H vs Orton: I know, I'm surprised too. For once, a Smackdown mainevent was last at WM. This isn't a bad match but HBK vs Beniot vs HHH was a way better triple threat match at a WM. Yes, I said the B word. Surprisingly enough Cena doesn't win, neither does Triple H. Orton makes the pin on Cena after HHH hits the Pedigree on Cena. Don't worry, if you actually like Cena, he'll probably have another shot at Backlash, same with HHH.

  Maywaether vs the Big Show: I just wanna say....eww. Mayweather getting a beating was fun when it lasted but this match still sucked as much as I expected. No one wanted the annoying Mayweather to win and he does after much interference by his bodyguards that he goes nowhere without. He hits Show with a chair a few times until he's on his knees and then hits him with brass knucks for the knock out. This match SUCKED. If there's gonna be a rematch, I'd love to see Show destory him at Backlash. But not gonna happen, this match was predictable because....tell me how many celebrites have put over wrestlers in the past. You think they'd sign to do a big match if they were gonna lose ? Hell no, even Cena put over crappy K-Fed.

  Edge vs Undertaker: In another fine match Taker fights hard to still be undefeated at WM. Edge was great here too though, he actually kicks out of the tombstone. He hits the spear but when he goes for the pins, Taker turns it into that new Triangle Choke submission move of his for the win. Hopefully Edge reveils that he was using Vickie soon after losing the title. I puke in my mouth every time they kiss, I know it's an angle but it's awful.",1206835200,2,4322,4.185765983112184

As usual we start of with a promo to hype us up, I believed it did work, it talks about how much different this card and situation is from from 23's. But it didn't show enough of the dominant ECW world Champion Chavo Guerrero.

Finaly w/ Hornswoggle vs. John Bradshaw Layfield in a belfast brawl
THis was a good way to start of the show, good spots, good use of weapons and no slow spots and Hornswoggle got beat up, buuuuut I did have a problem with the build-up; this was caused by the critical acclaimed storyline where Mr. McMahon finds out that he had another son by name of Hornswoggle, and for months we saw segments about tough love to only find out that Hornswoggle is really Finaly's son and it was just a scheme for something that was never explained, and for no reason what so ever JBL got involved and attacked Hormswoggle which caused this match to be. Yeah it was a waste of time

Next up we have Kim Kardashian conduct a interview on Mr. Kennedy. Even though I do not respect Kardashian, this is the right way of celebrity involvement, no talent was buried, the celebrity looked they were having a good time, and it was A lister so the WWE looks important

Money in the bank ladder match
Inc. Champion Chris Jericho (RAW) vs Shelton Benjamin (ECW) vs. John Morrison (ECW) vs. Carlito (RAW) vs. CM Punk (ECW) vs. MVP (smackdown) vs. Mr. Kennedy(SMackdown)
Spot after spot after spot, and they all looked like they hurt, Shelton falling into the ladder with it snapping in half being the best. Fat Hardy got his vengence on MVP by interfering and stopping MVP from getting the briefcase. Another unique quality about this match is that besides Chris Jericho who was already a star it was all young talent that everyone thought were going to be big stars one day ( too bad none of them did besides CM Punk)so it would of worked either way. Cm Punk ends up winning the match after getting Jericho's legs stuck on a step of a ladder.
Snoop Dog interviews Santino Marrella, yeah who cares, Santino is an idiot

Umaga (RAW) vs. Batista (Smackdown): Battle for brand supremacy
Worst match of the night. Umaga tried to get a good match out of Batista but it was obvious that Batista had little to no effort in this match, it was a 7 mins. match and for 6 mins. and 50 seconds Batista was laying down doing nothing .......LAME. Oh and another nip pick in this match wasn't there three brands in the WWE at the time? Shouldn't ECW have a wrestler trying to win brand supremacy but I guess we should already know that ECW is filled with jobbers and no chance in beating anyone on RAW and Smackdown.

PPV after PPV; the ECW championship match steals the show and at wrestlemania we thought it was going to be no different. We find out that Kane won the battle royal which did not came to no surprise since he was the only guy that can be considered a main eventer in the battle royal. Chavo comes out to the biggest pop of the night and as he waits for Kane in the ring, Kane enters the ring behind him and as soon as Chavo realizes it he charges at him like a goof and Kane grabs by the throat and chokes slams him for the 1-2-3, New ECW Champion Kane, great way to continue the legacy of the ECW Championship ( all jokes aside ECW needed someone like Kane and it was the right thing to have a squash match)

Career threatening match:
Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels

Match of the night with out a doubt and for a show like this that is saying something. Plenty of emotion for anyone who was a fan of Flair, Michaels almost kills himself by going through a table stomach first, Flair finally has a successful move off of the top rope, there was nothing I have nothing to nip pick about this match. This match is going to be the most remembered match on the card due to the stipulation; sadly a few years later Ric Flair checked into a retirement home known as Total Non-stop Action.

Playboy Bunnymania lumberjack match: Maria & Ashley vs. Womens Champion Beth Pheniox & Melina w/ Santino Marellea
Santino sucks,Ashley sucks, any story line involved with play boy sucks. It wasn't a horrific thanks to Melina's and Beth's ability to wrestle and they won so that's a plus. If I haven't told you guys let, SANTINO SUCKS

Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship
Triple H vs. John Cena vs. WWE Champion Randy Orton
This was 2008's version of The Rock vs. Stone Cold vs. Triple H that never happened, the match was pretty short but it had a quick pace in it, it played but the triple threat rules which I felt like that hurt that match,it wasn't bad match but it felt restrained and nothing new, however it was the right move for Randy Orton to win.

""The biggest vs. The Best""
Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather vs. The Big Show
The best celebrity wrestling match but it was booked very weird, Mayweather was the face but he was cocky and arrogant, Mayweather was the face but he had 9 guys backing him up, Mayeather was the face but he ran away from the match. Mayweather deserved to get booed during the match and he deserved to lose but whatever.

Main-event for the world championship match
The Undertaker vs. World Heavyweight Champion Edge
Fantastic way to end a fantastic show. This match had 11 months of build up, everything that happened in the past weeks before their match was gold. Edge was finally getting the chance to be on the main event of Wrestlemania and he did not blow it, Undertaker added on to his legacy, the booking was done perfectly, their was interference but not too much interference there was ref bumps , but not too much ref bumps. They broke out of each others signatures. The ending of this match was such a climax-tic way for The Undertaker to become 16-0

Final thoughts: Every match was solid to good; some matches could of been better if it had more effort and better booking, there was no bad decisions on the decided winners. The Commentators were mellowed and the crowd sucked, it bothers me when the crowd does not pop very much. This Wrestlemania could be considered the top five, if not it's for sure in the top ten. Anyways if you're looking to buy this show, I say buy it if you're looking for match quality; there are no extras besides the battle royal

WRESTLEMANIA 24

This is one of the best Mania's from this new era with almost every match delivering. In fact this Mania actually felt like a Wrestlemania in my opinion. Maybe it was the outdoor arena or maybe it was just the matches but it felt like Mania. Also this may sound weird but even some of the camera shots from time to time made me feel like I was watching a Mania of old, don't ask why?

1.[BELFAST BRAWL]JBL VS FINLAY-now I have read a lot of reviews and heard some people say that they really didn't like this match but I have to be honest, I enjoyed it. Sure the storyline was, well it came up a little short for me [get what I did there wrestling fans]. Now I know that Mr. Kennedy [Anderson] kinda ruined it, I know that is what you were about to say. Any way back to the match I really thought that this was an entertaining opening match. The hardcore no DQ style of the match helped a lot I'll give you that, but come on a hardcore style no DQ match is always fun. The action was quick and many a weapon was used even Hornswoggle got beat on a bit. JBL would win after a CFH but him nailing Finlay when he dived threw the ropes was crazy.

2.[MITB MATCH]CM PUNK VS CHRIS JERICHO VS SHELTON BENJAMIN VS JOHN MORRISON VS MVP VS CARLITO VS MR KENNEDY -ah yes the match that I still feel should have always been kept a Wrestlemania exclusive that became a gimmick PPV. I will admit that even on the MITB PPV the matches are always fun but when it was just a once a year thing at Mania it felt bigger. As I am sure you know these matches always guarantee us some incredible moments, highlight reel moments ""if you will"" in my best Dusty Rhodes voice and there is no shortage here. Morrison with his ladder moonsault and of course Shelton going through a ladder, watch and see. There are many more moments that make this one of the best matches on the card, plus the return of Matt Hardy was cool. In the end CM Punk figures out a clever way to win the match.

3.[RAW VS SMACKDOWN MATCH]UMAGA VS BATISTA-now I know I might get some heat for this but I thought this was a good match, especially with these two put together. It may have been the atmosphere but I thought this was a good match between two big men. Sometimes these big vs. big guys match-ups brings me back to the 80's for some reason, it felt like an old school Mania. Any way the action is quick paced between these two and Batista wins after a near screw-up Batista Bomb.

4.[ECW TITLE]CHACO GUERRERO VS KANE-after Kane won the battle royal earlier in the night he was given this title shot at the ECW title. Believe it or not but I was kinda looking forward to this match. I wanted to see how Chavo who was doing well at the time was going to handle this new challenge. Well seconds in we found out as he was defeated very quickly, what a waste. It is a rare thing when a squash match on a major event makes sense, very rare. It wasn't as bad as others because it was won by a monster like Kane but still I would have preferred the match. At least it wasn't as bad as the Bryan/Sheamus match, remember that? One of the few times I thought it made sense was at SummerSlam 88 when The Ultimate Warrior ran through The Honky Tonk Man. Any way Kane takes the ECW title.

5.[CAREER THREATNING MATCH]RIC FLAIR VS SHAWN MICHAELS-my favorite match of the night and the match that was supposed to end Ric Flair's career. Of course we all know he went on to have matches in TNA but still this was a great way for him to really go out. Two of the greatest of all time putting on a classic. This was the most dramatic match of the night and rightfully so the crowd was way into this. Flair put up a great fight and took two super kicks from Shawn while Michaels landed on the table after a moonsault. Then of course there is the ending to the match, classic with HBK retiring The Nature Boy, for a while anyway.

6.[PLAYBOY BUNNY LUMBERJACK MATCH]BETH PHOENIX & MELINA VS MARIA & ASHLEY-now I get the point of this match but I still have to ask, why? Now I know you have to get the ladies in here I am all for that but what is the point of the Bunny thing? Also I get that the celebrities usually help draw media attention but even Snoop looked bored out there on his thrown. Not that everything in this match is bad but it just does not stack up against the rest of the card, I do love Beth though. There is some good moments here and to be honest now that I am typing it the match wasn't too bad actually, I think it is the name and gimmick of the match that hurts it more. Maria and Ashley get the win although Beth and Melina are the ones who really made this match.

7.[WWE TITLE TRIPLE THREAT MATCH]RANDY ORTON VS JOHN CENA VS TRIPLE H-much better match than I thought it would be going in, I have no idea why I didn't think it would be. Triple threat matches always seem entertaining to me but I remember at the time I wasn't sure about this match. But this match turned out to be pretty good with all three guys got some shine and looked good. The ending was classic Orton punting Triple H's head off his shoulders after he pedigreed Cena. This lead to Randy keeping the title in a good, solid, full of action match.

8.[NO DQ MATCH]BIG SHOW VS FLOYD MAYWEATHER-I cannot stand Mayweather and can't stand the ending of this match. Much like when Randy beat CM Punk I have to say that the wrong guy won. You know what, I take that back, at least Randy is a wrestler. I love the entire match with Show demolishing Floyd and his cronies, oh how I love it. But then of course they have to have Floyd win, at least it was with some brass knucks. Tyson was brilliant in his role back in 98 so I get what they were trying to do I guess. I will say that at least the fans were very much behind Show here which I loved, gave me a little more faith in the fans.

9.[WORLD TITLE]EDGE VS THE UNDERTAKER-well at least that last match was not the last on the card and these two came to save it. This was a great match and a good way to end the night with Edge and Taker putting on a good show. Of course you all know Taker would win the title even after the interference. The action here was classic back and forth with each guy looking good by the end of it. The near falls added to the already entertaining match and the ending was perfect in my opinion.

EXTRAS

10. BATTLE ROYAL-this was the match that would determine who would get to face Chavo later on in the night for the ECW title, and as you read earlier Kane took this. I love battle royals and like always I loved this. There are some good spots in this and of course the action keeps moving.

The other special feature here is the HOF ceremony in its entirety with the members being Eddie Graham, Mae Young, Gordon Solie, The Brisco Brothers, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia, and Ric Flair of course. All of the speeches are excellent with Flair's being the highlight, and The Rock's being hilarious.",1355184000,,6938,4.184131736526946
3310982,5,B00124ONF6,"This dvd was shipped fast and was in great shape. Bought dvd for my hubby and he loves it, a lot.",1347494400,,97,3.6666666666666665
3310983,5,B00124ONF6,"I have to say that this was a really good Wrestlemania.  Some of the matches I didn't think would live up to how they were billed but those matches did and then some.  The event, which was the first outdoors show since WM 9, started with Soul/R&B singer John Legend singing a pretty good version of America the Beautiful.  After that we get your standard WM opening promo which was good this year.  Then we go into the intro of JBL and some of the events that led up to the Belfast Brawl.

The opening match was JBL taking on Finlay in a Belfast Brawl.  I am glad this was the opener because JBL is kind of boring to watch and Finlay, even though he is pretty fun to watch, could not carry this match on his own.  It was a good match not too long and not too short and it got the crowd pumped for the remainder of the show.  Of course Hornswoggle made an appearance and added some comedy to the match but was otherwise worthless.  The match was a little over 8:00 and an ok way to start the show.  (5/10)

Up next we get an interview with Mr Kennedy by WM host Kim Kardashin.  After that we go to the Money in the Bank Ladder match.  This year featured John Morrison, Carlito, Shelton Benjamin, CM Punk, Mr Kennedy, MVP and Chris Jericho.  This match was very good with a lot of insane high spots.  It did seem a little chaotic but otherwise it was 13:00 of fun.  This match, I feel, really got the crowd into it and there was at least a very deserving person who won.  (9/10)

Now we see Randy Orton, John Cena and Triple H all backstage preparing.  Up next we get footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then of course the introduction of the Hall of Fame class of 2008.  This year we see Jerry and Jack Brisco, Gordon Solie, Mae Young, Eddie Graham, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia and Ric Flair all go into the Hall.  This was a good class and none of the choices to go into the hall really left me scratching my head.  After that we get an interview with Snoop Dogg, Festus, Santino Marella and Mick Foley.  This was kind of a waste of time but fairly entertaining.

Umaga taking on Batista was next and to be honest I was expecting more from this match but it just ended up being a boring filler match.  All in all 7:00 of boredom.  (3/10)

Next we go backstage to see Floyd Mayweather and then they show footage of the battle royal that happened earlier in the day.  After that we get to see Kane destroy Chavo Guerrero for the ECW world title in only 11 seconds.  I wasn't surprised that Kane won but I was surprised that he won in just 11 seconds!  (1/10)

Up next is a WM commerical followed up by Raven Semoyne making an announcement about the Make a Wish foundation.  After that we see all of the events that led up the Career Threatening match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels.  Then we see an interview with Ric Flair.

Great entrances by Flair and Shawn and that was followed up by a great match up.  It was a very emotional match up as most people did believe that Flair was truly going to retire after this match.  It was a pitch perfect 20:00 match but was it match of the night?  I honestly don't think it was match of the night or even match of the year potential but other people did.  I thought it was slow and somewhat boring at times with Shawn definatly carrying Flair for the whole match.  It did pick up in spots and the ending with Shawn crying as he put Flair out of his misery was just fantastic.  (9/10)

After that we see Flair leave the ring to a standing ovation and then we get an interview with Edge.  There is an intermission of fireworks and then there is the introduction of the MC for the next match on the card which is Snoop Dogg.

The next match is really the worse on the show which is the Lumberjill match featuring Ashley and Maria taking on Melina and Beth Pheonix.  This match was just ok and then it was made worse when the lights in the stadium shut off and we had to watch the rest of the match with a few spotlights on the ring.  This match was just terrible from start to finish.  (1/10)

Up next is the events that led up to the WWE Championship match and then we get the entrances of each person in the match.  There is a special entrance for John Cena where a marching band plays him to the ring.  So the lights are still off at the beginning of the match and the match does start off slow but picks up when the stadium lights turn back on.  I do think that all 3 guys in the match had good chemistry with each other and I do feel that the match could have been a little longer but otherwise this was a good match.  I was a little shocked at the outcome when Randy Orton retained the belt.  I thought it was funny when we see who the fans thought would win and it's like 50 percent for John, 42 percent for Triple H and 8 percent for Randy.  So it was just funny to see Randy win.  (9/10)

After that we see the events that led up to the Boxer vs Wrestler match and that was followed by Big Show taking on Floyd Mayweather in a No Holds Barred match.  Honestly this was 11:00 of me sitting there rolling my eyes.  I know the WWE likes to make sure the celebrities never lose at WM but come on, you got the Show in there weighing 450 pounds and little Mayweather weighing in at like 150 pounds soaking wet and he still beats Show!  I have always felt that when a celebrity comes in and beats a WWE superstar it goes against everything that the WWE tries to ""teach"" everyone saying, ""We're a rare breed of people who do things that nobody else can do.""  Well apparently not when you've got this little runt being able to beat a monster of a man.  Still though, the match itself wasn't too bad.  (7/10)

After this there was another WM commerical followed by an attendance announcement letting us know that 74,635 people have attended the event.  After that we see all of the events that led up to the Main Event for the WWE World Heavyweight title match.  This, in my opinion, was match of the night between Undertaker and Edge who finally gets to main event a WM.  This match was back and forth, up and down, non stop action from the moment the bell rung.  People talk about the Flair/Michaels match at this WM but they need to talk about this match.  There wasn't a moment in this match that sucked, it was just great.  Taker won the match and won his 6th world title to conclude a great PPV.  (10/10)

All in all this was a very good PPV with some great maches like the MitB match, the Career match, the Triple Threat match for the WWE title and the Main event.  There were some stinkers too like the ECW title match and the Lumberjill match but still this is a PPV worth viewing again and again.  I give this WM a 9/10.  It's worth checking out.",1336867200,,6715,4.173676012461059

Disc 1

-Belfast Brawl, Finlay vs. JBL: This was stemming off the Hornswoggle/Vince/Finlay storyline where Vince had Hornswoggle beat up in a cage. This was a good, hard hitting version of a hardcore match. Plenty of weapons are used including a cookie sheet, trash can, a table and Finlay takes a hard trash can lid shot as he dives to the outside. I did like how at one point JBL threw a garbage can at Hornswoggle knocking him out (can't stand that guy). JBL ends up hitting the Clothesline From Hell to with this hard fought match. 8/10.

-Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. CM Punk vs. MVP vs. Mr. Kennedy: This was supposed to include Jeff Hardy but he stupidly got suspended for drug use so he was out (nice job since it appeared he was slotted to win this). Anyways as for the match itself it had the usual high spots including Morrison hitting a moonsault to the outside while holding a ladder. Every guy got their spots in and Shelton took a nasty bump off one ladder through another ladder set up on the outside. Matt Hardy does make a shocking appearance preventing MVP (who injured him months back) from winning. CM Punk pulls Jericho's legs into the rungs of the ladder and climbs to retrieve the briefcase. 9/10.

-Howard Finkel introduces the 2008 Hall of Fame Class including: Jack and Jerry Brisco, Gordon Solie (accepted by his family), Mae Young, Eddie Graham (accepted by his son Mike Graham), Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia (accepted by his wife and daughter), Ric Flair (accepted by his family, mainly cause he was wrestling tonight).

-Battle For Brand Supremacy: Batista (Smackdown) vs. Umaga (Raw): Its a big man vs. big man match that just didn't click to me. They tried hard, each hit some big power moves but there was nothing too memorable about this one. Batista does end up hitting a sloppy looking Batista Bomb to win the match. 5/10.

-ECW Championship Match, Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kane: Before the live show Kane won a 24-man battle royal to win the right to face Chavo during the PPV. As for the match, don't blink or you'll miss it, Kane suprises Chavo during Kane's entrance, hits a chokeslam and pins him to become the new ECW champion in roughly 8 seconds. 5/10, cause its so short, though it was fun to watch.

-Career Threatening Match, Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels: Even though he was pushing 60 at this point, Flair pulled out a last good performance on the biggest stage of them all and what a man to wrestle in his last match in HBK. Shawn does take a sick landing on the announce table and both me do go all out, with Flair even locking on the figure four a couple of times. The ending was very emotional as Shawn didn't want to hit Sweet Chin Music on Flair for a second time but he did and made the cover thus ending The Nature Boy's long career. 8/10, for the match, 10/10 for the emotional factor. It was quite a sight to see Flair as he left the ring defeated but still with his head held high.

-Playboy Bunnimania Lumberjack Match: Maria and Ashley vs. Beth Phoenix and Melina: Sad to see an actual good women's wrestler like Beth reduced to being in this average match. The antics before the match with Snoop Dogg were amusing but Ashley had no business in the ring. The lights went out during this match, which was probably just as well since it wasn't a very well put together match. Man did that cause the fans to crap on this match more. There was a cool spot where Jerry Lawler had enough of Santino's interference and punched him. Beth hits a fishermans buster on Maria for the win. 5/10.

-Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H vs. (John Cena: I will admit that was a cool entrance by Cena and the match was actually good considering a Triple Threat is hard to pull off. There were some cool spots, unexpected submission moves and some good brawling. Cena tries twice to get Orton to tap out to the STFU, Triple H even uses the crossface on Cena to try to get him to submit. Triple H hits the pedigree on Cena, makes the cover, but Orton runs in, punts Triple H and Orton covers Cena to retain his title. 8/10.

Disc 2

-The Biggest vs. The Best: Big Show vs. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather: As far as worked boxer vs. wrestler matches this is the best one, which mind you isn't sayin much. This was about Show getting his hands on Floyd and beating him up while Floyd had to resort to having his posse interfere. He used a chair multiple times on Show and even used brass knuckles and Show couldn't answer the 10 count. 6/10.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. The Undertaker: This is the definition of main event, these two put on a hell of a match. The momentum went back and forth and at times you felt like Edge may have actually had Taker's number. Taker of course did hit his trademark dive like he does every Wrestlemania. Edge hit a massive spear, went for the cover but Taker kicked out. Edge hit a second spear, but as he gloated Taker locked on the Hell's Gate submission out of nowhere and Edge had no choice but to tap out. Taker wins the World title for the second year in a row at Wrestlemania. 10/10.

Hall of Fame Ceremony

Its worth watching especially for the speeches by Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia (done by his daughter and wife) and the speech by Ric Flair was truly emotional.

Jerry and Jack Brisco

1. Finlay vs JBL Belfast Brawl: This was a fun way to start the show, good use of weapons, a table spot, this match is a lot better than I expected it to be, i liked it, I would of liked to see it given a bit more time but it was good anyway, good to see hornswoggle get his head taken off by a trash can ***

2. Chris Jericho vs MVP vs Shelton Benjamin vs CM Punk vs Jon Morrison vs Carlito vs Mr Kennedy Money in the Bank Ladder Match: This match was brilliant, not the best money in the bank match, but its up there in my favourites, so many good spots, I liked benjamin going through the ladder, the twist of fate off a ladder, morrison doing a moonsault with a ladder and jericho hitting a codebreaker with a ladder, this is an amazing match ****1/4

3310988,5,B00124ONF6,"So, first off. This was my first WrestleMania and PPV I saw as it aired and it was an awesome experience. This event made me realize that professional wrestling is much better when you have no idea of what will happen. Now, as with all reviews, this is just the viewpoint of a wrestling fan, so it's all just my opinion. So, with that said, let's review the event.

Dark Match: Kane won a 24 man battle royal to win the #1 contender spot to the ECW Championship later in the night.
--------------------------
So, this is a DVD extra and it really is just a basic battle royal. Although, I've personally always been a sucker for battle royals and it was enjoyable. As a big Kane mark, I was really excited when I found out Kane won.
6/10

1. JBL defeated Finlay
---------------------
The story behind this match was that Hornswoggle was revealed as Mr. McMahon's illegitimate son. However, Vince abused Hornswoggle, enlisting JBL to attack him in a cage. Finlay then came to Hornswoggle's protection.

This match was a Belfast Brawl, and while people tend to not like it as much. I personally enjoyed it for what it was. I thought it was a solid opener and a fun brawl filled with weapon spots including the frequent use of the trash can. My favorite spot of the match was JBL throwing a trash can at Hornswoggle (God, I can't stand him) outside of the ring. JBL wins a 9 minute Belfast Brawl with a clothesline from hell
8/10

2. CM Punk defeated Mr. Kennedy, Chris Jericho, MVP, Carlito, John Morrison, and Shelton Benjamin in a 7 Man Money in the Bank Ladder Match
--------------------------
Besides the first Money in the Bank, this is my favorite Money in the Bank match to date. I was sure that Chris Jericho would win this match, but I was delighted by the nice surprise. The match itself features many awesome and unique spots with the ladders, including John Morrison's back flip off with one off the turnbuckle, Matt Hardy interfering and hitting MVP with a twist of fate off the ladder, Shelton Benjamin's superplex and powerbomb combo, and my personal favorite, the ladder V that was created. The ending was incredibly well done as CM Punk had Jericho in a tree of woe on the ladder as he unhooked the briefcase in 14 minutes.
9/10

3. Batista defeated Umaga
-------------------------
As I watched this, I remember really disliking it. However, as I rewatched it again on DVD, I found out this is a pretty decent match. The back story for this is basically a battle for brand supremacy and that's about it. This is a pretty good big man match. There isn't a whole lot memorable about it, though other than a really crappy looking Batista bomb at the end for the victory at the 7 minute mark.
7/10

4. Kane defeated Chavo Guerrero for to win the ECW Championship
--------------------------
There is really not a whole lot to say about this other than it was a disappointment. If they were given more than eight seconds, I'm sure they could have gotten a good match out of it, as proven by their Backlash match a month later. It was awesome seeing Kane win a championship, though. Other than that, it's an eight second match that ends with a chokeslam.
DUD

5. Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair in a Career Threatening Match
---------------------------
The storyline to this was a good six months of buildup. Vince McMahon gave Ric Flair an ultimatum that the next match he would lose, his career is over. This match was one for the ages as Shawn Michaels steals the show like he always does at WrestleMania and Ric Flair puts on one last amazing match before he retires. The match was filled with pure emotion, including Shawn Michaels doing a sick springboard moonsault across the announce table and the final superkick, ending Ric Flair's thirty plus year career at around 20 minutes. The most dramatic match of the night by far, which followed up by an equally emotional farewell for Ric Flair the next night on Raw.
10/10

6. Beth Phoenix and Melina defeated Maria and Ashley in a Lumberjill Match
-----------------------------
Funny how the talented divas are on the heel team as the face team was two divas that received short Playboy pushes. The match was your basic uneventful diva tag team match. The right team won as Beth hit the glam slam on Maria. After the match, Maria got a kiss from Snoop Dogg.
3/10

7. Randy Orton defeated Triple H and John Cena to retain the WWE Championship
-----------------------------
I really enjoyed this match as it felt like a main event of WrestleMania should, although I was really surprised that this wasn't the main event. I much prefer their match at Night of Champions 2009, as this match was too short and ended as I was really getting into it. Some really cool parts of this match were Orton's double DDT on Triple H and Cena, the tower crossbody, and the ending which saw Triple H hit the pedigree on Cena, only for Orton to punt Triple H and pin Cena for what I thought was a surprise ending at 15 minutes.
9/10

8. Floyd Mayweather defeated Big Show in a No DQ match
-------------------------------
Now, this match was probably the very best celebrity involvement I have ever seen in professional wrestling. Mayweather and Big Show put on a very entertaining 12 minute match as Big Show nearly has Mayweather beat numerous times, but Mayweather gets the knockout with the brass knuckle use.
8.5/10

9. The Undertaker defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship
-----------------------------------
This match is my favorite WrestleMania main event ever. This match just told an amazing story as it started out slow, but progressively picked the pace up. Edge countered many of Undertaker's signature moves until Undertaker hit a tombstone, but the ref was out. By the way, Charles Robinson running down the ramp was a funny sight. Edge hit a second spear on Undertaker, but Undertaker countered into Hell's Gate, causing Edge to tap out at the 24 minute mark. That moment in time, I really rethought the obvious result. This was one hell of a match and I'm glad to have witnessed it as it progressed.
10/10

Finlay vs. JBL-Belfast Brawl
An ok opener. I wasn't very crazy about this match and just thought that it was kind of a filler. Really these two didn't have a good rivalry going and this should have just been on RAW. This would have been a good match if JBLOSER hadn't have made it so slow. But the only good thing about this match is that it has a lot of good weapon use.
Match rating:3/5

CM Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Chris Jericho vs. Carlito vs. MVP vs. John Morrison-Money In The Bank Ladder match
A good match. Just like all the other money in the bank ladder matches, this match has a lot of highflying moves by morrison, punk, carlito, and benjamin. A wild moment with Benjamin flipping off a ladder and landing and going through another, and the crazy top rope moonsault with a ladder by morrison. Clever ending with punk getting the case after jericho got stuck in the ladder.
match rating:4/5

Battle of the Brands
Batiista vs. Umaga
Ok match. These two didn't have a great rivalry going, but this match is almost solid. Both men had a lot of moments like batista getting a botched batista bomb.

Career threatening match
Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair
Another classic put on by these two. Put these two in a match and you will get one freakin' awesome bout. This match was voted match of the year and i agree. This match had moments like hbk missing a moonsault and going through the announce table, the 2 sweet chin music's, and the ""Im sorry, i love you"" said by michaels. Great match here and worth watching.

Playboy Bunnymania lumberjack match
Beth Phoenix and Melina vs. Maria and Ashely

Match rating:0/5

Triple threat match for the WWE championship
Randy Orton vs. Triple H vs. John Cena
Good, solid match here, but way too short. This match had a lot of aggressive action and was good. This match went from cen/orton, to cena/orton/hhh because of a elimination chamber a month earlier. Good moments like a crossbody electric chair on cena. Cheap win by orton getting the pin on cena after a pedigree and punt on triple h.
match rating:4/5

No Disqualification
Big Show vs. Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather
This match was what was headlining wrestlemania. But, in my opinion, this match was just all hype. This match was just plain out dominated by show. The match didn't get good until the end when Maywheather tried to leave and show put him back in the ring. Funny and great moment when show gets knocked out with brass knuckles.
match rating:2.75/5

World Heavyweight championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
This is one of their best and first encounter of 2008. The buildup for this match was great after taker won a #1 contendership elimination chamber at no way out. This match had everything from counters, to submissions, to finishers, to even a cheap interferance by the edge heads(hawkins and ryder). Great ending with taker winning by submission and making edge bleed from his mouth. Definatly a match worth watching.
Match rating:5/5

This ppv is highly recomended and a great way to start a collection. The best matches that are definatly worth watching are the world title, michaels/flair, and triple threat match.",1262217600,,3518,4.714983713355049

3310994,4,B00124ONF6,"Belfast Brawl: JBL vs. Finlay (with Hornswoggle)
Nothing like a good 'ole hardcore match to start off the evening at the WWE's biggest and most important event of the year. The match was actually pretty good, with Finlay taking some nasty head shots with trashcans and trashcan lids. There was some back-and-forth action, with JBL also taking quite a few bumps, including a counter by Finlay off of steel steps, and Hornswoggle beat the crap out of JBL with a kendo stick at one point. The highlight of the match was when Finlay dived through the middle ropes and JBL dodged him and smacked him right in the head with a trashcan lid. JBL ate a Celtic Cross and was thrown through a table set up in the corner, but still kicked out. The finish came when JBL took Hornswoggle out by throwing a trashcan at him and then hit Finlay with the Clothesline from Hell to get the win. Winner: JBL. Match Rating: 4/5

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Carlito vs. Chris Jericho vs. CM Punk vs. John Morrison vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin
Another great match but it really pales in comparison to last year's Money in the Bank. There were some sick ladder shots everywhere, but there wasn't really anything new we were seeing. Morrison hit a moonsault to the outside onto most of his opponents using a ladder, which was a sick spot. At one point, Kennedy was about to superplex John Morrison off a ladder, but Shelton Benjamin, climbing the ladder next to them, hit a sunset flip powerbomb on Mr. Kennedy off the ladder, causing Kennedy to hit the superplex on Morrison at the same time! That was awesome. Later in the match, Shelton Benjamin got taken out of the contest after he was spilled off a ladder and through a ladder set up like a bridge, similar to what Jeff Hardy did to Edge last year. It would have been much cooler if we hadn't already seen it before, is what I'm saying. Carlito hit a Backstabber to Jericho off a ladder, which was awesome, and Jericho and MVP had a little ""jousting"" spot with ladders that was also interesting. Carlito spit apples in Mr. Kennedy's face, and Morrison got knocked onto the top rope off a ladder right on his groin, ala Shawn Michaels. Jericho nailed CM Punk with a Codebreaker using a ladder, which was also a sweet spot, but at one point, everyone in the match was down except for MVP. MVP started climbing the ladder, but then Matt Hardy (!!!) ran out to a big pop and hit MVP with a Twist of Fate off the top of the ladder to prevent him from winning the match! The run-in was sweet, if not a little expected, and it was sweet, sweet justice since MVP had injured Matt months before. The end came when Jericho locked in the Walls of Jericho on John Morrison using the ladder and Mr. Kennedy then attempted to grab the briefcase, but CM Punk hit him with a ladder in a way similar to how Kennedy hit CM Punk at last year's match. Jericho and Punk then battled over the briefcase, but Punk tripped Jericho, causing Jericho to get stuck in a ladder rung and allowing CM Punk to win the match. It was an amazing and phenomenal match, it just wasn't as good as last year's. Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 5/5

Battle for Brand Supremacy: Batista (with Theodore Long) vs. Umaga (with William Regal)
The consistantly good matches keep on rolling in for this pay-per-view. It's SmackDown! vs. Raw for this match, with Batista representing SmackDown and being managed by SmackDown's assistant General Manager Teddy Long, and Umaga being managed by Raw's General Manager William Regal. The match was pretty straight-forward, with Umaga actually dominating Batista for a good portion of the match, and the crowd even got behind Umaga a little. Batista did an excellent job of selling Umaga's submission maneuvers, no matter how stupid they were, and Umaga missed a flying headbutt off the second turnbuckle on Batista. Batista tried to scoop slam Umaga at another point, but Umaga converted the move into a crossbody. Later, Umaga tried to hit Batista with the Samoan Spike, but Batista powered out and hit the Spinebuster out of nowhere! He followed up with an astonishing Batista Bomb on the giant Umaga to get the pinfall and win the match for SmackDown!. Nothing amazing, but it was still a very solid and very entertaining match. Winner: Batista. Match Rating: 4/5

ECW Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kane
Wow, what a terrible idea. Instead of keeping the momentum and having an at least decent match between Chavo and Kane, the WWE decided to end this match in less than ten seconds. Basically, Kane starts out in the ring behind Chavo, having come through the crowd, gives Chavo a Chokeslam, and then pins him to win the ECW title. It's cool to see Kane with a championship again, but Chavo really deserves much more credit than to be beaten with a single move. Still, I'd rather have the crap short and sweet than long and painful. Winner: Kane. Match Rating: 2/5

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels
Emotions. When a wrestling match makes you feel emotional, that's when you know it's an absolute classic. The stipulation was, once again, that if Ric Flair lost, he would be forced to retire. The match started out with a lot of powerful chops and with Flair and Michaels doing their usual routine, albeit with a lot more force put behind it. Flair took a lot of bumps, being dumped to the outside and landing pretty damn hard, but he nailed a picture-perfect flying crossbody on Michaels. At one point, Flair was resting against the announce table, and Michaels tried to hit him a springboard moonsault, but Flair moved out of the way, and Michaels hit his stomach on the edge of the table, with the rest of his body going through it! Absolutely breathtaking! Flair dominated for a portion of the match, focusing on Michael's now injured abdomen. Momentum went back to Michaels, and he nailed the Flying Elbow Drop! He then went for the Sweet Chin Music but hesitated at the last second. Flair tripped him and then locked on the Figure Four! Michaels was in the submission hold for a long time, but he got the ropes. Flair locked in the Figure Four Leg Lock again later, which led to a flurry of perfect counters from both competitors. The match went outside again, and Michaels hit a moonsault on Flair that was quite the spectacle. Back in the ring, Michaels hit Flair with the Sweet Chin Music, but astonishingly, Flair kicked out! Flair kicked Michaels in the groin, and when Michaels locked on the Figure Four, Flair's own maneuver, on the Nature Boy, Flair distracted the referee by taking the bottom turnbuckle off. This gave Flair the opportunity to poke Michaels in the eyes, just like the old days! The match continued with solid back-and-forth action, but Michaels went to a corner, ready to nail the Sweet Chin Music on Flair again. Tears were going down Michaels's cheeks, and Flair, bleeding from the mouth when Shawn slapped him in the face at the beginning of the match, stood up, ready to try to fight Michaels. Shawn said, ""I'm sorry. I love you."" and hit Flair with the Sweet Chin Music. That was all she wrote, and the legendary career of Ric Flair was brought to a close in one of the most emotional and heartbreaking matches in not only WrestleMania history, but the entire history of professional wrestling. Winner: Shawn Michaels. Match Rating: 5/5

Lumberjill Tag Team Match: Ashley and Maria vs. Beth Phoenix and Melina (with Santino Marella)
I was surprised that this match was actually good. Beth Phoenix is very talented as a wrestler and she reminds me of Chyna in so many ways, and coupled with the talent of Melina, I was still in doubt. I mean, Ashley and Maria are basically only known for their sexiness, and that's about all they're good for. Well, the match actually proved to be entertaining. Snoop Dogg was at ringside in a big old chair that looked like the King of the Ring chair, and there were a bunch of Lumberjills, basically all the other WWE Divas working for the company, surrounding the ring. Even Victoria was out there, which was nice. I miss her. Regardless, the match had some basic moves, with a surprisingly nice headscissors by Ashley, and Melina and Phoenix stole the show with an awesome moonsault off of Phoenix's shoulders by Melina. Santino interrupted a cover by Maria, so Jerry ""The King"" Lawler got up from his announcing seat and punched Santino in the face! Melina and Ashley and all the other Divas ended up in a brawl outside of the ring, and Phoenix took advantage of the chaos by hitting Maria with a stalled fisherman's suplex to get the pin. Winners: Beth Phoenix and Melina. Match Rating: 3/5

Triple Threat WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. John Cena vs. Triple H
This match literally made me laugh out loud by the end of it. Throughout the contest, Cena, Triple H, and Orton did their usual stuff, with Orton trying to use cheap tactics at the start by nailing Triple H in the face with the WWE Championship. Cena showed off by getting both Triple H and Orton on his shoulders, but Triple H fell off and then kicked Cena right in the groin! Orton performed a double DDT off the second rope to Triple H and Cena, and then couldn't decide who to RKO in a particularly entertaining part of the match where Orton was crawling around and drooling in anticipation. It was almost scary. Cena got up first, and Orton tried to RKO him, but Cena pushed him onto Triple H! The rest of the match was pretty solid, with Orton nailing the RKO on Triple H, who smartly rolled out of the ring, to Cena locking on the STFU on Orton. Triple H got back into the contest and started brawling with Cena, incapacitating him by throwing him so hard into the steel steps that they literally flew out of position. Back in the ring, Triple H tried a very well done inverted Indian death lock, but Cena broke up the submission. Orton then suffered yet another STFU from Cena, but Triple H broke it up by pulling Cena's arm away from Orton's face and locking in the Crossface! Cena got the ropes, unfortunately, and the match went on with Cena nailing his usual power moves and Triple H taking most of the pain. However, Triple H managed to hit Cena with the Pedigree out of nowhere! Triple H made the cover, but Orton punted Triple H in the head, his good `ole concussion kick, and then pinned Cena for the win! Hilarious ending! I love it when Cena loses, and it was awesome to see Randy Orton, the best bad guy around in WWE right now, retain his championship at WrestleMania. Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

No Disqualification Match: Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather (with his entourage) vs. The Big Show
Just like the women's tag team match earlier, this match surprised me with its quality. Big Show took some sick jabs from Mayweather at the outset, and Mayweather outmatched Show with his speed. The fans were behind Big Show the entire time, which was great and it worked really well, especially when Big Show started nailing some moves back. Big Show actually stomped on Mayweather's arm, and he knocked a member of his entourage off the apron when Mayweather started mocking Big Show. Show gave one of Mayweather's entourage members a sick chop across the chest, and then followed up with one for Mayweather. Mayweather and his entourage then started to retreat down the ramp, but Big Show followed them, taking out a few members of Mayweather's entourage, and then dragged Mayweather by his head back down to the ring! Show was about to nail his Chokeslam, but a member of Mayweather's entourage ran in and smacked Show in the back with a chair. Show responded with a Chokeslam for this guy, but then ate a chair to the head and back from Mayweather! Mayweather then hit Big Show with two absolutely sick chair shots, and then pulled some brass knuckles off of one of his unconscious entourage members. Mayweather straight-up punched Show right in the face with the brass knuckles and pinned him for the win. It's disappointing that we didn't get to see Mayweather get Chokeslammed, but the match was pretty entertaining, and it was cool to see the fans behind Big Show. Winner: Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather. Match Rating: 4/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge (Champion) vs. The Undertaker
Undertaker always gives spectacular performances at WrestleMania, and with someone talented as Edge as his opponent, we all know that this match was going to be great the second it was booked. And man, it was. It started off fast and exciting, with a lot of powerful moves being used by both wrestlers, with Undertaker doing a variation of the Stone Cold Stunner using the ring rope, and Edge doing the same thing, only as a neckbreaker. At one point, Edge went to the top, but Undertaker knocked him to the outside, causing Edge to flip and just SMACK right on the ground! OUCH! Undertaker then dove out of the ring like he usually does, and nailed Edge with an amazing flying clothesline. Back in the ring, some more sweet spots were pulled, and Edge was actually dominating the match for a good portion of it, even nailing a superplex on Undertaker. Edge countered Old School twice, as well as the Snake Eyes/big boot combination, but Undertaker countered a Spear attempt by Edge. As the match went on, more solid and entertaining wrestling transpired, with Undertaker going for a knee in the corner, but ended up being dumped to the outside. Undertaker hit a Chokeslam on Edge finally, but Edge managed to kick out!!! Undertaker went for the Last Ride, but Edge ended up nailing a neckbreaker out of nowhere! Edge got frustrated and called for the Tombstone Piledriver...and ACTUALLY GOT UNDERTAKER IN THE POSITION! Undertaker countered the move into his own Tombstone and...EDGE KICKED OUT!!! Wow!!! Edge is really becoming a big thing in the WWE, and he's going to be in the Hall of Fame if he keeps putting on extraordinary matches like this. Edge dodged a big boot that hit the referee, and Edge took advantage of this opportunity by hitting Undertaker with a camera he stole from a cameraman on the outside of the ring, even knocking the cameraman flat on his butt! Undertaker still kicked out! Zack Ryder and Curt Hawkins ran out after Undertaker nailed the Last Ride I believe it was, but Undertaker Chokeslammed one of them off of the apron and onto the other one in an absolutely sickening way! This gave Edge the opportunity to nail the Spear...BUT UNDERTAKER KICKED OUT AGAIN! The ending came when Edge nailed yet ANOTHER Spear, but Undertaker countered it out of nowhere into Hell's Gates, and Edge, bleeding profusely from his mouth, ended up tapping out. Phenomenal match. Winner: The Undertaker. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

There was a lot going on at WrestleMania XXIV. There were interviews, musical performances, and appearances by celebrities, including Raven Samone and Snoop Dogg, as well as  Kim Kardashian. Snoop Dogg nailing Santino with a clothesline, and Dogg's interview that also included Mick Foley and Festus as part of the proceedings was pretty entertaining. The Hall of Fame highlights were tearjerking, and Mae Young's appearance was pretty funny. Edge gave a pretty good promo to hype up his match with Undertaker. It all went very smooth and surprise appearances by our favorite superstars was great. Rating: 5/5

EXTRAS

The entirety of the Hall of Fame ceremony is included. This is great, though a lot of the speeches just seem to drag on, especially Rocky Johnson's. The Rock's return to the WWE to induct his father was great fun, hilarious, and spine-tingling as he hinted towards ""one more match"", and even expressed interest in wrestling John Cena, Shawn Michaels, Rey Mysterio, and even Stone Cold Steve Austin one more time. Also included on the Extras is the Battle Royal for the #1 contender's spot in the ECW Championship match that took place later that night. Since you know who wins and the thing was just an excuse to get all of the WWE superstars an appearance at WrestleMania XXIV, it's not really that great, though there are some cool spots. Rating: 4/5

OVERALL EVENT

Almost all of the matches were absolutely wonderful. The opening match was a hardcore bout that was very entertaining, while the momentum continued with the always astonishing Money in the Bank ladder match, as well as an impressive battle between Batista and Umaga. The Flair/Michaels match was heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once, plus it was simply a great showing between two of wrestling's biggest stars. The only disappointments were the tag team women's match (though it had its moments), and the ECW Championship match between Kane and Chavo. Big Show/Mayweather was great fun, and both the WWE Championship match and the World Heavyweight Championship match was great. I just can't get enough of John Cena getting pinned.",1247011200,2,16846,4.723223393403604

3311002,5,B00124ONF6,"I don't understand how people are giving this less than five stars this is a great ppv and a great wrestlemania maybe the best

finlay and little horny vs jbl we start with the belfast brawl which was a pretty good hardcore match bad storyline but good opener it got me into the show they used a lot of hardcore toys and it was great until the finish which was pretty weak at least to me it was 4.5/5

mitb chris jericho vs shelton benjamin vs john morrison vs carito vs cm punk vs mvp vs mr kennedy this is the best mitb at least to me it is just awesome all the spots and it moved along perfectly but the best spots are morrison's moonsault with a ladder, benjamin's bump on the ladder, matt hardy comin in and his cutter off the ladder on mvp, carlito's back breaker of the ladder, the tower of doom off the ladder and morrison's bump on his crotch 5/5

umaga vs batista i was with the people in the front rows u u umaga u u umaga but of course this is the wwe and of course at wrestlemania because he lost last year batista had to have a win umaga beats him up the whole match and batista hits a spinebuster like always and then botched his sit out powerbomb which looked cool but at least he didn't kill our fatu 3/5

ecw championship kane vs chavo guerrero and off course i agree with everyone else o wait no i don't this is stupid it almost killed the whole show 1/5 for the good chokeslam

shawn michaels vs ric flair now thank god they had this match now it saved the show from dieing and it is the second best match of the card it is great some real good chops and some leg locks from both men and ric flair finally hits his diving cross body from the tope rope and also look right after hbk hit him with the superkick the last time he starts crying because he knew that this was the finish to his last match 5/5

maria and ashley vs beth phoenix and melina now i don't know what is so wrong with this match it is a pretty good womens match if you look at the playboy team it is there best match for both but not for wrestlemania 2.5/5

wwe chamipionship john cena vs hhh vs randy orton this is a pretty good match and a lot better than what i was thinking it was going to be but still felt like it could have been better but it was a little over ok and at least it wasn't main event 4/5

big show vs floyd mayweather it was so much better than i thought it would be and i find it very good fun to watch and i never got bored with the match but again a least mayweather didn't beat show cleanly like i thought he was going to be so that makes me feel better that paul didn't come back just to get buried right when he came back 4/5

world heavyweight championship undertaker vs edge o my freaking goodness this is one of the best wrestling matches i have ever seen they put on one heck of a show counter after counter and false finsh after false finish it is just one of the best matches i have ever seen and when i saw it for the first time to me it istantly became in my top ten best matches 5/5 and its a show stealer

76% which is a pretty good grade

the other match is a bad battle royal but the hof was really good this year so watch it also the best ppv for tna and wwe since bound for glory 2007 which is one of the best shows i have ever seen so if you don't have this or that buy them both great great shows",1216512000,,3328,3.9596412556053813
3311003,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania 24 was the second WM I've seen on PPV (WM23 being the first). I enjoyed it, but I felt it wasn't the best WM I've seen to date.

My Mum got me the limited edition tin case edition of WM24 for my 21st birthday on 13/07. I was going to buy it anyway, so that was a bonus.

First off, I have to commend the WWE for the packaging of the DVD. The tin case is superbly made, the DVDs themselves have a full colour photo on them and the whole thing is gorgeously made. They put a lot of effort into the packaging of the DVD and it shows. As a bonus, a card with a filmstrip of a scene from a past Wrestlemania is included - Shawn Michaels vs Steve Austin. A cool collectable.

Now, onto WM itself. It was a good event, worth the time and money, but in my personal opinion, it wasn't as good as the past few WMs. Let's rundown the matches:

Belfast Brawl: Finlay (w/ Hornswoggle) vs JBL
I was expecting this match to be boring because of JBL, who can't wrestle to save his life, but it was actually really exciting and a good opener to the show (I know the battle royal was the actual opener, but this was the opener on TV). It was great seeing Hornswoggle back and he even got involved. Loads of weapons were involved and there were a few great spots. The only downer was that JBL won. That makes it lose a star. (4/5)

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs John Morrison vs Carlito vs CM Punk vs MVP vs Mr. Kennedy
Another exciting MITB match, I think this one was better then last year's. Highlights included Shelton Benjamin's fall onto a ladder (and Carlito's facial expression afterwards), Matt Hardy running in to stop MVP getting the briefcase and CM Punk and Chris Jericho's fight at the top of a ladder to get said briefcase. CM Punk won and I'm glad. A great match. (5/5)

Battle For Brand Supremacy: Batista vs Umaga
This match was kinda boring. It wasn't up to WM standard and could have been featured on Raw or Smackdown. Speaking of which, Batista won, which means Smackdown is the better brand? I don't think so. Raw has been way better then Smackdown since the beginning of 2008. And Batista was wasted in this match, they could have found a way better match for him. But he won, and that's good. A mediocre match and Batista messed up the Batista Bomb, so that ruined it. (3/5)

ECW Championship Match: Chavo Guerrero (champion) vs Kane
This was the first match for a title, and yes it was only 8 seconds long but it was damn brilliant. I can't stand Chavo, so to see him lose that fast was just hilarious. It was great to see a new ECW champion and the whole thing was just funny. I can't give it a high mark though. (2/5 - just for the funny)

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels
Match of the night, without a doubt. This one was worth the money of the PPV alone. I'm a huge Shawn Michaels fan, so to see him in a huge match such as this was just amazing. I think everybody knew that Ric was going to lose and retire, but it didn't ruin the match. Both men had their strong moments, and I winced when Shawn did the moonsault onto the announce table and cracked his ribs. The moving moment when Shawn mouthed ""I'm sorry, I love you"" made me cry and the standing ovation Ric got after ity was over was a perfect ending. Epic and should have been nearer the end of the card, for sure. This match also lead into a superb feud between Batista, Shawn and Chris Jericho that culiminated in some amazing matches at subsequent PPVs, too. (5/5)

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Maria & Ashley vs Beth Phoenix & Melina (w/ Santino Marella)
w/ Snoop Dogg as the Master Of Ceremonies
Lumberjacks: Mickie James, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly, Cherry, Jillian Hall, Victoria, Layla, Katie Lea Burchill, Eve Torres & Maryse
I think I'm the only person who didn't think this match was that bad. It was really a match to calm people down after the Shawn vs Ric match right before it. Beth & Melina won, but Maria and even Ashley got in some good offence. Jerry Lawler got involved, taking down Santino and even Snoop attacked him after the match. I would have preferred a Women's Championship match though. (3/5)

Triple Threat Match For The WWE Championship: Randy Orton (champion) vs Triple H vs John Cena
Before I get into the match, how hilarious was John's entrance? He had a whole brass band play his entrance music xD I had no idea who the hell was coming out until his video began to play on the Titantron. The match itself was very entertaining - I find most triple threats/fatal 4 ways to be. Loads of attempted pins and breakups of pins, loads of crazy moves and the such. I was laughing all the way through it. I think most people were surprised that Randy retained though, as most people predicted John to win. Good match though. (5/5)

The Biggest vs The Best: Big Show vs Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather (w/ his HUGE entourage xD)
I was expecting this match to be absolutely horrible, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was rather entertaining. I find Floyd Mayweather incredibly annoying though and I was rooting for Big Show the whole time (so was the crowd I noticed). Show did get offence in on Mayweather that I enjoyed and he even got some of his entourage too. Mayweather won after hitting Show with brass knuckles. It was pretty good for the match containing a celebrity. (4/5)

World Heavyweight Championship Match: Edge vs The Undertaker
I know some people say this match was predictable considering it was Edge's title vs Taker's reign, but there were moments when I thought that Edge might have actually beat Taker. Especially the Spear, I was on the edge (hah bad pun) of my seat, willing for Taker to kick out. Edge got help from the cronies (Hawkins & Ryder) and overall the match was exciting. Of course the best moment was Taker locking on the submission move and Edge tapping out. Brilliant end to the PPV. (5/5)

Overall, the show was good but not outstanding. Shawn vs Ric, the WWE title match, MITB and the WHC title match were the best matches. Everything else was either good (Show vs Mayweather, Belfast Brawl), ok (Divas), mediocre (Batista vs Umaga) or just funny with how ridiculous it was (ECW title).

Also on the DVD is the 24 Man Battle Royal that Kane won to qualify for the short ECW title match. It was on before WM went to air, and was quite entertaining. I was glad Kane won.

The other thing on the DVD is the 2008 Hall Of Fame induction ceremony. I've never watch the HOF in full before but I wanted to see The Rock and Ric Flair's speech so I watched the whole thing. It was uber long but really entertaining. The Rock is very funny - I laughed when he made fun of Chris Jericho's hair and The Marine (John's face was so funny) xD Ric's speech was both funny and moving.
The one thing I didn't like is how it was on 2 DVDs, half of the HOF was on the 2nd DVD and the other half on the 3rd. It ruined the flow for me.

Overall, a superbly made DVD, a great Wrestlemania and one of the best matches of 08 in Shawn vs Ric. A great buy.",1216080000,6,7046,4.358993902439025
3311004,3,B00124ONF6,The matches were not good at all....it could be better but wwe din't effort themself to the top...i expect that next mania would be better,1215648000,,138,4.56
3311005,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania XXIV was held on Orlando, Florida at the Citrus Bowl on Sunday March 30 2008. It was a great experience, I was there, the best thing was one of the few Wrestlemania ever held on an open field, so that add to the experience.

There are great matches here, but the most notorious, is the one with Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels, that would go down in history as the last match of the Nature Boy Ric Flair.

Also the championship match of Randy Orton, Triple H and John Cena in a triple threat match, the second time we have a triple threat in WM history would go down as one of the best matches all around.

The Undertaker vs Edge was a fun match but definitely not one of the best for any of them.

The Money in the Bank Ladder match was also a pretty good match.

The Divas match and the ECW championship match were the two bummers of the night.

This DVD capture the experience very well, as for extras there is the Hall of Fame ceremony, not one of the best but still fun and exciting due to the fact that Ric Flair was been inducted.

If you are a wrestling fan this is a must, you will enjoy this DVD, and if you were there like me, you will remember that Wrestlemania weekend at Orlando, FL. I know I will.",1215475200,,1221,4.1265822784810124
3311006,5,B00124ONF6,i just tell everybody this is the first dvd of wwe that is blue ray and i must tell you its excellent everything you expect it from a blue ray to watch it on play 3 or player with blue ray with an hd tv,1214697600,,202,3.511111111111111
3311007,4,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania 24 lived up to the hype no doubt about it. A very solid PPV, and the matches all delivered. It would have been nice to have some extras on the disc, because the only extras are the HOF ceremony and the 24 man battle royal. I definately reccomend you to purchase this though.

Belfast Brawl- Finlay vs JBL: A pretty good match with a few bumps. This was definately a brawl. The best spot of the match was when Finaly went diving through the second rope only to get a stiff hit in the head with a trash can lid in mid air. Very good spot. Also a moment that gave me a laugh is when JBL tossed a trash can at Hornswoggle. I must admit though the table was broken in a way that looked like it didn't hurt and i think the match should have introduced a few more weapons. Good match, but could have been better.  3/5 stars

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Excellent match. My favorite MITB match yet. This match had many crazy moments, and I can only imagine how crazy this match would have been with Jeff Hardy being it (but he got suspended). Definately a match i could watch again. Best spot of the match came when Shelton was tossed off a ladder in the ring and landed on a set up ladder on the outside, in which the ladder broke. Crazy moment. But then again many moments where such as: Backstabber off the ladder, Moonsault of turnbuckle with ladder in hand, Sunset Flip Powerbomb/superplex off ladder. Along with many more. Definately a great match.  5/5 stars

Battle for Brand Supremacy- Umaga vs Batista: Decent match, but to be honest what can you expect out of these two? There's not a moment worth mentioning, and the ending came with a very sloppy batista bomb. Ok match but wasn't Wrestlemania worthy. And one thing i don't understand is what was the point of this? How does that prove Smackdown is better? but anyways i give this a 2/5 stars.

ECW Championship- Kane vs Chavo Guerrero: Absolutely Terrible use of ECW. For the first time ever there will be an ECW title match at Wrestlemania, the only bad thing is the match ended in less than 10 seconds (somewhere around 5 or 7 seconds). Horrible way to use ECW and i personally would have liked these two guys to at least have a 10 minute match.  1/5 stars (the reason i give it a star is because of Kane's pyro lol)

Career Threatening Match- Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair: This was no doubt about it match of the night. Very emotional matchup and a very good wrestling match. The match had many counters, and was evenly match. Shawn Michaels goes for a moonsault later on in the match and manages to hit his stomach on the edge of the anouncers table. Looked like that hurt a lot. But this match was very emotional with the fact that Shawn Michaels couldn't seem to finish the job and didn't want to. Finally Ric Flair stands up crying and shouts to Shawn Michaels ""Come On"".. Shawn then utters the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"", then hits a SCM to finish it. That classic finish will definately be talked about for years to come. If you're a Ric Flair fan you will definately be proud of this match.  5/5 stars

Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match- Maria and Ashley vs Beth Phoenix and Melina:  An ok wrestling match, but the real reason they had this match was to really promote Maria's Playboy shoot and to show the sexy divas. Not really much to say about this match besides the lights go off halfway during it and it had a pretty good ending with Snoop Dog clotheslining Santino. Which by the way im marking out for Santino, he's excellent on the mic. 2/5 stars.

WWE title Triple Threat Match- Orton vs Cena vs HHH: Pretty good match with a few good moments, such as the double rope DDT by orton on Cena and HHH. The top rope superplex/electric chair drop was also well done (but then again nothing we haven't seen before right?) well the match was an ok one but i think WWE should have put more time into the match than Cena's entrance -_-. But needless to say i was extremely happy about the ending which is why i give this match a 4/5 stars.

Big Show vs Floyd Mayweather: Pretty Good match. It was anything goes and boy did they take advantage of that. It was good to see Show slam Mayweather a couple of times. As well as Chokeslam a few of his Mayweather's henchman. I just didn't like the fact that Show lost, but then again it was very predictible seeing as a celebrity never loses at Wrestlemania, and not to mention the fact hat Floyd's undefeated. I just don't think Show should have been brought back the way he did. But i guess it was an ok match and the ending was a very solid punch (with brass knucks) which connected perfectly. It looked like it hurt.  3/5 stars.

World Heavyweight Title- Edge vs Taker: I was extremely proud of this match. And this is almost as good as the Flair HBK match. Very Back and Forth match with each superstar hitting numerous finishers and getting close counts. Edge is very talented and i love the way he managed to counter some of Taker's moves in the coolest (sorry for lack of a better word) way. Very unpredictable match and had an awesome ending. What a way to end off Wrestlemania.  5/5 stars

All in all Wrestlemania this year was really good and i reccomend you purchase this DVD. Especially for the Money in the Bank match, Flair vs HBK match, and Taker vs Edge match.",1214611200,,5306,4.38148524923703

I attended WrestleMania 24, it was a beautiful day, we had some sprinkling rain, 74,000 people live in the sunshine state of Florida.
No matter where you went that day, rather it was hotels, or grocery stores, WrestleMania 24 posters were everywhere.

I brought this DVD and I love it, it reminds me of how special that day was, bigger than the super bowl and any football fan that was there would tell you the same.

Transfer is sharp as what it should be. If you had any interest with wwe and own a blu-ray player this is no brainer over regular dvd.  You won't go back to dvd once you see in HD!",1212278400,,484,3.938775510204082
3311011,4,B00124ONF6,"OK.

The title, for those curious, is because everyone else has already talked about the event; regardless of whether I agree or disagree, it's all moot.  I'm here to talk about the Blu-ray and the quality thereof.

The main thing you need to know - THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING.  I dare say it exceeds the HD broadcast version of the event.  Note that this does NOT support 1080p, however do not let that deter you.  1080p is a hype machine designed for the cats with 60 inch plasma screens in custom theaters.  If you've got a 40-50 inch anything, you can set this to 720p and trust me, the quality is as it should be.

The audio quality is decent, but definitely not the most bang for the buck.  No DTS HD.  No 7.1 (probably doesn't affect anyone reading this).  No WMA Pro.  No Master Audio.  Basically, it's plain Jane Dolby Digital 5.1.  I'm miffed at why they short changed the audio at such an event, especially considering it was an outdoor event that could have been significantly enhanced with the presence of HD audio.

The extras are basic fanfare in my opinion, but what stands out is the (somewhat) full Hall of Fame.  The main detractor, and one reason I knocked a point off, is the editing of Ric Flair's speech to take out Benoit's name.  I know WWE doesn't want to associate with someone alleged with killing their family.  However, that doesn't mean we should forget the man he was before he allegedly did what he did.  Ric was talking about the history of Benoit and should have been allowed to speak his piece properly.  To edit it is a travesty.

I was anticipating further edits of the event like they did with Wrestlemania 22 (cutting out Mickie's infamous lick), but no, they left the event mostly intact, even the lighting issues that happened during the event.  I'm a stickler for staying true to the original integrity of events like this, so this was a positive for me.

The other reason I knocked a point off is the price.  There's just no excuse for it.  I mean they bumped up the broadcast price $10 and priced the Blu-ray at the price the PPV used to be at...why?  If I got a guarantee that WWE would release EVERY SINGLE PPV in Blu-ray unedited from this point forward, fine...then it's a choice of watching the PPV right away or waiting for the Blu, just like people do with DVDs now, but I know they won't do that.  Plus this is worth MAYBE $25, not the $40 Amazon wants, and that's low compared to some retailers.

So...is it recommended?  Yes.  Is it overpriced?  Yes.  Does it deliver?  In some ways, yes.",1212192000,2,2551,4.464208242950108
3311012,3,B00124ONF6,"This is the first WrestleMania DVD that I have bought that I am very upset with. Usually the three disc set is Disc 1 & 2 being the event, and alot of extras on disc 2. Then disc 3 is usually the entire Hall of Fame, this year Disc 1 & 2 features the event, and Disc 2 & 3 is the Hall of Fame. The only ""extra"" is the Battle Royal before the event, and I don't even consider that an extra since it was shown on [...] before WrestleMania began. I was going to purchase this DVD no matter what because of the Hall of Fame, as I do every year. Yet the extras always make the dvd a collectable, but this year the WWE did not put alot of effort into this release. I was hoping for extras like Mr. McMahon on the walk of fame, press conference highlights, or even Ric Flair highlights. I hope the lack of extras of Ric Flair shows up on his next DVD release in july.",1211846400,,860,3.92
3311013,5,B00124ONF6,"Belfast Brawl Match: Finlay vs. J.B.L. - This was just a glorified way of saying that this match was a street fight.  With weapons like a chair, trash cans, and Finlay's usual prop (sorry, I can't spell it right if I tried) & the return of Hornswoggle, who got involved at times, this was a very enjoyable brawl & the best performance I've seen from J.B.L. since his return.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs. C.M. Punk vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. John Morrison vs. Carlito vs. M.V.P. vs. Mr. Kennedy....Kennedy (sorry, I'm a mark for that) - Anyways, you know that this match is set to be nothing more than a non-stop spotfest and boy was it ever.  Morrison's moonsault off the top rope with ladder in hand & later taking a fall that every man watch felt, Shelton Benjamin's ""tower of doom"" powerbomb off the ladder & his fall out of the ring onto the ladder wedged on the outside, the Walls Of Jericho on the ladder, Carlito's ""backstabber"" off the ladder, and the return of Matt Hardy.  One of the best Money In The Bank's matches yet.

RAW vs. SmackDown: Batista vs. Umaga - This was the first flop of the night as Umaga completely dominated & carried this match (and even had the crowd cheering for him) until Batista blocked the samoan spike & ""unleashed the animal"" with the spinebuster & powerbomb (which he lost his balance doing).  It wasn't as bad as Cena/JBL from WrestleMania 21 but it's basically the same type of match.

ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs. Kane - Unfortunally, I blinked during this match & missed the whole thing.  Just kidding but seriously, Chavo's entrance was longer than the match as Kane chokeslammed his way to the first World/Brand Championship in almost 10 years & possibly setting a new WrestleMania record (sorry King Kong Bundy).

Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair - Unfortunally, Ric Flair's matches as of late were just lackluster to average as best but Shawn gave Ric the best match he's had since the 2005 series of matches with Triple H.  This match was an emotional rollercoaster as you saw Ric Flair pulling out some of his old ""dirtiest player in the game"" tricks on HBK throughout the match while HBK was conflicted with ""putting 'Old Yeller' out of his misery"" & even held back from taking Flair out with sweet chin music early in the match.  During one point, HBK returned Flair's slap from RAW & drew ""first blood"" on Flair by making his mouth bleed while later, Flair looked like he was fighting for his life in HBK's figure four & even ripped off the bottom turnbuckle post in the process of trying to get out of it.  However, Flair's career was ended with the words ""I'm sorry, I love you"" & the third sweet chin music.  This was the type of performance that Ric Flair needed to end his career on...and he got it.

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Maria & Ashley vs. Beth Phoenix & Melina - Looking that all the previous ""Playboy"" matches in WM history, I expected the usual boring trainwreck but this match was better than I expected as Beth & Melina showed by they were some of the best female wrestlers in mainstream wrestling today (with some nice doubleteam work) while Maria did a decent job in the ring herself & Ashley was able to not drag the match down unlike last year.  There was a moment when the lights went out and had to put spotlights on the ring but it was still a watchable  match with cameo appearences from Santino Marella, Jerry Lawler, and even Snoop Dogg throwing a clothesline that look better than anything Ashley did.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena vs. Triple H - Before I get started, I liked Cena's entrance with the college band playing his entrance music.  Well, this was the shocker of the night concidering the winner of the match was the person nobody expected just based off 92% of WWE's own poll & a majority the comments in the reviews of Royal Rumble & No Way Out on Amazon itself.  As for the match itself, it was your typical triple threat match in which it was non-stop action with each man having their moments at various times along with the various moments of one man stopping another from winning the match before Orton got the biggest win in his championship reign...and for those trivia fans who like to keep score of this type of thing, this was Cena's first WrestleMania loss & the fourth time a heel has walked out of WrestleMania a World Champion.

Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather - Well this was the best ""worked"" boxing influenced match I've seen in wrestling but concidering how crappy the other ones were, that's not much of a compliment. The match was entertaining for what it was once they got away from trying to make it a look like a real ""shoot"" match & started getting entertaining with Mayweather's crew getting involved at times with chairs & brass knucks coming into play.  Too bad they didn't book Mayweather as the heel in this feud, as he is just a natural in that role, because I got a guilty pleasure out of Big Show chopping & just manhandling him at times.  In the end, this match was like the Billionaries match last year where it was about the the hype of the celebrity appearence to draw money instead of having a high quality match so with that in concideration, this was an entertaining match for what it was...and at least he didn't have to see Big Show in a diaper unlike his celebrity match at WrestleMania 21.

WWE Champion Edge vs Undertaker -  Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually deliveres...and this was no expection.  Edge worked on Taker's back thoughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose.  Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (PLEASE FIND A NAME TO THE HOLD ALREADY!).  As a side note, let's be honest here...did anyone ever think we would see Johnathan Coachman ever calling a WrestleMania main event based off how bad he's been in the past?  I thought he was going to take away from the match with his commentary but props for Coach in putting on a good performance, he wasn't Jim Ross but he was better here & throughout the show than he's usually been in the past.

The only DVD extras here was the entire Hall Of Fame ceremony (spread over two DVD's) inducting The Brisco Brothers, Gordon Solie, Mae Young, and Eddie Graham.  The real highlights though was the return of The Rock to induct his grandfather Peter Maivia & his father Rocky Johnson...but not before roasting various members of the WWE roster to the point to where I had to pause the DVD because I was laughing so hard.  Along with this was the induction of Ric Flair by Triple H including the story of how he met Ric Flair with a baloon & even giving a mention to Michael ""Stay Puff Marshmellow Pimp"" Hayes.  The other was the traditional WrestleMania preshow battle royal which was won by Kane.

In the end, this was the most enjoyable WrestleMania I've seen since 20 as everything was watchable & nothing was so horrible that I would skip over it everytime I watch the event.  This was a 4 star event but the Hall Of Fame & even the battle royal which had it's entertaining moments like Jamie Noble's creative way of getting back in the ring without his feet touching the floor push it up a star.  I highly recommend this WrestleMania event.

Side Note: The Wal-Mart version of this WrestleMania comes with the McMahon DVD.",1211500800,3,7705,4.541907514450867
3311014,5,B00124ONF6,"For the first time in a long time, WWE got it right & delivered an event that was worthy of being called their biggest event of the year as this event really had so much to offer. In fact, I thought this event was better than the last couple WrestleManias including the previous year's card.

Belfast Brawl: J.B.L. vs Finlay. Thank god that I didn't pay any attention to the storyline that started this feud because I would not have cared for it otherwise. Besides that, this was a good opener as this was really just a fancy way of saying that this was a hardcore match as both men brawled & used weapons like trash cans, kendo sticks, steel steps, a table & even Hornswoggle getting involved in the action as this was perhaps J.B.L.'s best match since returning.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Chris Jericho vs CM Punk vs John Morrison vs Shelton Benjamin vs Carlito vs Mr. Kennedy vs M.V.P.. This was the best one that they have done since the original MIB match as there were just so many spots to mention here along with new ones that we have never seen before. Moments include Shelton's athleticism along with taking a sick fall through a ladder, Morrison doing a moonsault to everyone with the ladder in his hand, Carlito delivering the ""Backstabber"" to Jericho off the ladder, the sunset flip/suplex sequence off the ladder involving Benjamin, Carlito & Kennedy, & Jericho applying ""The Walls"" to Morrison on top of the ladder. Awesome match to watch from start to finish.

Battle for Brand Supremacy: Batista vs Umaga. This was a RAW vs SmackDown interpromotional match but this was really just a decent match at best as Umaga mostly dominated this entire match & even go the crowd on his side before Batista did his usual Hogan/Warrior routine in order to win the match in the end.

ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero vs Kane. First of all, I just want to say that I don't care about what they do to ECW because the old ECW is long dead. Anyways, that statement was longer than this match as it ended in ten seconds with Kane winning the title.

Career Threatening Match: Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels. The stipulation here was that if Flair loses this match, he must retire. This was one of the highlights of this event as this was just an emotional, techincal wrestling match as you can literally see the emotion from both men whether they were trading submission holds or even engaging in their battles of chops to the point where HBK wanted to taunt Flair but out of respect decided not to. The crowd was heavily into this one but it all ended for the Nature Boy after HBK, who was conflicted, decided to the end the whole thing with the third sweet chin music leaving barely a dry eye in the audience as Flair's career was over but not before getting a tremendous ovation on his way out.

Playboy Bunnymania Lumberjack Match: Melina & Beth Phoenix vs Maria & Ashley. Snoop Dogg was the master of ceremonies but this was a much better match than it looked on paper considering the history of these matches really stinking up the joint when it happened at WrestleMania. Although I am sure this match would have been better with the original Candice Michelle being in this match but again, it was better & watchable than I thought it would. However, the highlight for me was seeing Snoop Dogg deliver a great clothesline to Santino which I thought was funny.

WWE Champion Randy Orton vs Triple H vs John Cena. For the third year in a row, Cena had a unique entrance with the marching band & while I was not too big on it, I'll give credit for him doing something new. Anyways, this was a good triple threat as it was non-stop action with all three men facing off with one another at one point in time with one moment to look out for would be Triple H using the crippler crossface to Cena. But the real highlight here was the ending was done so well that it shocked everyone in attendance as it was also the person that nobody expected to win...and I mean that in a good way.

The Biggest vs The Best: The Big Show vs Floyd Mayweather. This was a shoot fight where you can only win by pinfall, submission or knockout while the match was changed to a No Disqualification match which really made this a very entertaining match. If you didn't pay a attention to the angle, you would have thought that Big Show was the fan favorite as the crowd supported him & booed Mayweather. In fact, they enjoyed him beating up Floyd which I have to admit that liked as well before Mayweather's people got involved in the match that lead to Floyd winning the match using a steel chair & a brassknockled right hand.

World Champion Edge vs The Undertaker. Even though Flair/HBK may be the match that most fans consider the match of the night, I would go with this one as I thought this was the better quality encounter out of the two. This match started slow but it picked up & got better as time went on that resulted in a great wrestling match between these two as they went back & forth with Edge targeting Taker's back to the point where Edge was able to counter most of Taker's signature moves in so many ways that it looked so impressive that you thought he was going to win at times. Undertaker never fails to deliver a great performance in main event situations as he delivered just like he did last year & was able to overcome the odds (including Edge's sidekicks) with the gogoplata submission hold to win his 6th World Championship & his 16th WM victory.

DVD extras include the battle royal that was played before the event to determine the #1 contender for the ECW Championship which was won by Kane with some entertaining moments including the way that Jamie Noble got back into the ring. The other extra is the entire Hall of Fame ceremony with inductions of Ric Flair, Mae Young, Rocky Johnson, High Chief Peter Maivia & others but the real highlight was seeing the return of The Rock to induct his father & grandfather but also making a few jokes to some of the WWE roster which was really some hilarious stuff worth checking out.

Overall, this was the best WrestleMania that I have seen in years as not only you got two great extras here but the event itself is a quality card that any fan would enjoy.",1211414400,,6209,4.466490299823633
3311015,5,B00124ONF6,"UPDATE 2/10/09:

I recently ordered the Blu-Ray version of this card and let me say as great as it looked on regular DVD, it is BEAUTIFUL on Blu-Ray! If you have a Blu-Ray player or a machine that can play Blu-Ray discs, then its worth it plus its more convenient as you have one disc for the card and one for the Hall Of Fame show!

The review below was mainly on the original 3 disc set:

For me, when I bought this set (which also came with the McMahon DVD as well that came out two years ago), I bought it mainly for Michaels Vs. Flair but I've looked at the whole card and here is my opinion:

JBL Vs. Finlay (Belfast Brawl) - Kind of a weak opener considering that both men are very good brawling wrestlers! JBL comes out on top in this one.

Chris Jericho Vs. Shelton Benjammin Vs. John Morrison Vs. Carlito Vs. MVP Vs. C.M. Punk Vs. Mr. Kennedy (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - Too many high spots to call but I will say this, a couple of them had me cringing in pain, particularly Shelton's fall on the ladder and Morrison's fall on his b*lls from the near top of the ladder onto the top rope! To Morrison, I have one word for you: ICE and plenty of it!

We also see a surprise appearance from Matt Hardy as he prevents MVP from winning the match with a ""Twist Of Fate"" from the ladder. Ends when C.M. Punk ties up Chris Jericho's legs on the ladder and claims the briefcase for himself.

Batista Vs. Umaga (Smackdown Vs. RAW) - Not a great match BUT I've seen a lot worse too. Worth a look or two. Ends when Batista gets in his ""Batista Bomb"" on Umaga, which he nearly botches but manages to correct it in mid-drop to keep Umaga from falling on his head or worse!

Chavo Guerrero Vs. Kane (ECW Championsip Match) - Two words: 12 seconds!

Shawn Michaels Vs. Ric Flair (Career Threatening Match) - The main reason I purchased this set. Even knowing what was going to happen and what did happen afterwards, I found myself nearly in tears again just like the night they held the in-ring tribute on RAW the next night!

As for the match, I wouldn't rate it a 10 BUT it was no lower than an 8. Had this had been Michaels Vs. Ric Flair of the 1980's, then this would've been a 10 without question! As it was, its even more impressive that Flair (at around 60) could still put on a good match. No real words I can write will give this match justice. All I can say is see it and if you are really the sensative type, break out the tissues! It's that emotional!

Maria & Ashley Vs. Melina & Beth Phoenix (Playboy Bunny Lumberjack Match) - Not really worth watching except for the end when Snoop Doggy Dog did a surprisingly good clothsline on Santino Marrello as he was taunting Maria after the match! Even more surprising was seeing Snoop make out with Maria! Hope Snoop cleared that with his wife first! LOL!

John Cena Vs. Randy Orton Vs. HHH (WWE Title Match) - Got to admit, as a former band geek myself from my high school days, I found myself watching Cena's unique entrance in this match. Nice to see.

As for the match, it was good but not great. It was mainly finishers in this match. The surprise of the bout (for me) was seeing HHH break up Cena's STFU on Orton with....THE FREAKIN' CROSSFACE! The fans actually cheered on this one! I, myself, was thinking ""He lost the World title to that hold back in 2004! Wouldn't this be irony if he won the WWE title with the same hold!"" Of course, that didn't happen as Triple H hit his Pedigree move on Cena only to have Orton steal the pin after his punt kick to the head of ""The Game.""

So, as of this WrestleMania, Triple H is still winless since 2004. John Cena has lost his first WM since 2004 and Randy Orton has WON his first WM since 2004! Talk about irony!

The Big Show Vs. Floyd Mayweather - More entertaining than expected. I actually enjoyed this match. Even though he lost at the end, I loved seeing TBS beat the hell out of Floyd and his crew! Ends when Mayweather kicks TBS in his ""manhood"" and uses some brass knuckles to knock him out!

The Undertaker Vs. Edge (World Heavyweight Title Match) - This was Edge's first main event and let me say he showed he belonged there. I love The Undertaker BUT I have to give credit where its due....EDGE KICKED HIS A**! Sorry but its true though I am glad to see UT could pull it out at the end! Ends when UT catches Edge in his gogoplata chokehold for the submission after a lengthy bout dominated mostly by ""The Rated R Superstar."" Great way to end WM.

This set also has the Hall Of Fame ceremony. I haven't watch that yet but I'll come back and update my review once I've looked at it. Great purchase!",1211414400,8,4617,4.240318906605922
3311016,5,B00124ONF6,"I'm not going to go into great detail about the card of the  night because I'm pretty sure most know what it was by now.  I will say besides a few duds, it was a great card.  I will go as far as to say that it is the best Wrestle Mania since the days of Stone Cold and The Rock headlining the main event.

I'm mainly here to talk specifically about the Blu-Ray version.  This is by far one of the best looking, clearest, most colorful Blu-Rays I have seen yet.  I don't have HD cable so I watched WM24 in standard def.  After watching it on Blu-Ray, it was almost unbelievable on how much more detail the Blu-Ray version had.  I was able to see bruises and cuts on superstars that I was not able to do in SD.  Everything just had almost a three dimensional ""pop"" to it.  Something worth noting that it is only in 1080i(in which I it was viewed from a 57"" 1080i HDTV in my case)but it is so incredibly crisp, I don't see how you would notice.  I've viewed atleast 30-40 Blu-Rays since getting my PS3 and WM24 is easily at the top of the list.

So the video quality(You know, one of the main reasons to get the Blu-Ray version) is easily rated 5 stars IMO.

Other than that, it's an amazing pay per view regardless if it has a few matches that aren't that great.  Just having Ric Flairs historic last match on here makes this worth the price of admission alone.",1211328000,4,1359,4.137404580152672

3311019,5,B00124ONF6,"Watching this Wrestlemania was a joy. to me there was only one sub par match on the card and it was still descent. i guess i'll go match by match like everyone else.

finlay vs jbl- one of the better hardcore brawls we've seen in sometime. trash cans, kendo sticks, cookie sheets, steel steps were all used and this was the right match to open with. could of gone a little longer but was fun while it lasted and i loved the ending unlike a lot of people. fun match.

money in the bank- this one never disappoints and i thought this years was the best. i don't understand alot of people saying it's the weakest of them all. tons of action, killer spots, a great return of a missed superstar and a great ending with the right guy winning. this match ruled.

batista vs umaga- this was the one kind of letdown. neither guy seemed overly inspired although umaga looked to be trying hard. big dave just seemed kind of off and i thought the powerbomb at the end was great even if it seemed a little botched. it still looked powerful and made sense given umagas size.

kane vs chavo- kane gets his moment, he deserves it. quick, no complaints as i don't think it would've been a good match otherwise.

ric flair vs shawn michaels-the best match of the night, hands down. great story, great wrestling, off the chart emotion. this will be a big wrestlemania moment forever. kudos to vince for letting flair go out on the grandest stage of them all with the best there is going right now. this match was incredible and the end was perfect. the cameras were spot on getting both guys and setting the incredible emotion in the ending of that match. nice touch for everyone to just shut up and watch flair walk that aisle for the final time. this is worth buying the dvd for alone. incredible.

the bunnymania match- a good cooldown match. i even enjoyed it. they tried hard and didn't screw anything up. it wasn't a mat classic but everything they did was well executed and they didn't even blink during the power failure. ashley still is pretty bad. maria did pretty good and the heel team were both good. not bad at all.

cena vs triple h vs orton- i loved this triple threat match. fast paced. some new inventive spots and i love how the match ended and who won. a great triple threat match and a great match period. the 2nd best wrestlemania triple threat just a hair behind wm 20.

big show vs mayweather- i expected an atrocity. whoever booked this deserves a huge bonus. this match was entertaining and turned out being ten times better than i ever thought it could be. mayweather sold like a pro and big show looked great here. fun match.

edge vs undertaker- glad this went on last as i think taker should've been in the last match at wm 23 coming off his royal rumble win. him and edge go on to have a hell of a match. started off slow and built it into a great match. the final ten minutes were great and i loved the ending. taker breaking out a suprise and something new. the perfect ending to an incredible wrestlemania.

i hope to be there in person next year but this wrestlemania comes highly recommended. a very solid and entertaining four hours. my only complaint is we watched it in hd which is widescreen and the release info says fullscreen. i'm hoping that's a typo. it was shown in high def widescreen so the dvd should be widescreen too. that's just a personal gripe though. don't pass this one up though. it's a hell of a show.

EDIT: The WWE did the right thing and released this dvd in a spectacular quality 16x9 widescreen transfer which was one of the things that was greatly debated before release. I won't review it again but watching it a second time just brought back the memory of what a great event it was. An excellent wrestlemania. I can only imagine how great the blu-ray version looks but this dvd looks great as well and is in glorious widescreen. Kudos WWE!",1208995200,2,3886,4.405857740585774
3311020,5,B00124ONF6,"Wrestlemania is now one of those shows that even if you're no longer a wrestling fan you'll check it out or at least talk about it. Most every person can say they were once a fan of wrestling, either when they were a child or are still wrestling fans but slightly ashamed to admit it. Wrestlemania gives you that platform to look into the past and remember the good old days of your childhood and remember your first Wrestlemania. Over the 24 years of its existence it's given us some big memories that we will never forget and this year is no exception.

Match Card:

John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield vs Finlay Belfast Brawl Match: This was basically a no DQ match with a fancy name, Hornswoggle who we had learned the week before was actually the son of Finlay and JBL was out to defend the McMahon family name by getting revenge on his behalf. It had some back and forth action to which the crowd were split, some behind Finlay & some behind JBL, even Hornswoggle had his fans. Good opener I thought.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: CM Punk vs Chris Jericho vs Shelton Benjamin vs John Morrison vs MVP vs Carlito vs Mr Kennedy. Of the 3 years it had already taken place, the MITB match had left its own mark and now has become a fan favourite. The winner of the match gets a shot at the WWE heavyweight title anytime over the next 12 months. This match had the usual high risk stunts and botches, which made it an edge of your seat match which became quite enjoyable.

Batista vs Umaga: I didn't watch this one

Kane vs Chavo Guerrero: ECW Championship too short to even discuss

Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair Retirement Match: This was a genuine tear jerker as this could possibly be Ric Flairs last ever match. It was very back and forth with the trademark moves taking place but the match was wholly around the emotion and it's something that will stay in our minds for years to come.

Beth Phoenix & Melina W/Santino Marella vs Maria & Ashley Playboy Bunnymania Luberjack Match: Snoop Dogg was the special announcer for this match and it was truly a match befitting for a man like this. I didn't really pay attention to the actual match.

Randy Orton vs Triple H vs John Cena: WWE Championship Match: This was a hugely hyped match and was truly the centre point  for the whole event, Cena had returned from injury to win the Royal Rumble event and challenge the champ at the Wrestlemania Main Event.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Big Show: Now when it comes to headline matches you can't really say anymore about this match as the participants alone make you interested and make the purchase price for the PPV worth it and definitely the DVD price. There were rumours that Mayweather was paid $20 Million to participate in this event but the whole marketability for this match I'm sure made this worth it for the WWE. There were people in my work place who had never watched wrestling before and they were talking about this match and the buildup so it was definitely something special.

Undertaker vs Edge: World Heavyweight Championship. The title wasn't the only thing on the line as the Undertakers 15 - 0 undefeated streak was also on the line. It was a very back and forth match and was, at times very hard hitting.

Overall it was a good show and something that you should get on DVD especially for the HOF ceremony that took place the night before which would have you in tears with Ric Flairs acceptance speech.",1208649600,,3413,4.487096774193549

3311024,5,B00124ONF6,"This set would be worth your money even if the Ric Flair v. Shawn Michaels match was the only match on it.

Add to that the fact that there were other good matches as well, (most notably Edge v. The Undertaker, The Big Show v. Floyd ""Money"" Maywether, and the Money in the Bank match), and that you get the entire Hall of Fame ceremony on the 3 disc version, (including Ric Flair's unedited induction speech that clocked in at almost 90 minutes and was said to be amazing), and you'll see that you'd be getting a great deal even at twice the price.

3311025,5,B00124ONF6,"As Wrestlemania 24 was getting closer I couldn't help to think that it wasn't going to be that great. Well, I'm glad to admit I was totally wrong. Wrestlemania 24 was not only great but it was full of emotion and it was very close of being flawless. For me, a 30 year old guy who's been a fan for 20 + years not only of WWF/E but also NWA (WCW), AWA, WWC, WCCW, ECW, etc, this Wrestlemania was one of the best ever.
By far and without a shadow of a doubt the best match of the evening was The Nature Boy Ric Flair against the Showstopper Shawn Michaels. As the match was coming to an end I couldn't help to drop some tears as I (and everyone watching) was able to see how history's been written. Hats off to Ric Flair and HBK for giving a magisterial performance.
Another match I enjoyed very much was the Money in the bank match, even though I wanted Chris Jericho to win. I'm not a big fan of watching wrestlers putting their body's on the line like that (don't get me wrong, I loved the old ECW) but I'll have to admit it was very very entertaining. 5 stars!
Well, I hope WWE events continue to have the same impact as this Wrestlemania. All matches were from Ok to amazing. The only 2 matches that I didn't enjoy were the Bunny mania and the ECW title match.

1. John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield vs. Finlay- Belfest Brawl
This was a good choice to start off the grand daddy of them all. some very hard head shots with cooking sheets and trash cans and one vicious shot to jbl with the sheila leigh from finlay. a table also comes into play and the ending was appropriate to me. 3.75/5

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Chris Jericho vs. Kennedy vs Cm Punk vs Shelton Benjanmin vs. MVP vs Carlito vs John Morrison
This was a spectac match, it wasn't all the way spectacular, but it was a very spectact match. morrison did some crazy stuff with the ladder i've never seen before in my life, you will be impressed by this match. i don't know what happened to jeff hardy in this match but somebody will come back to shock you for his absence. a very spectac match. 4.75/5

3. Batista vs. Umaga in Raw vs. Smackdown
This match reminded me of the Goldberg/Lesnar match from wrestlemania xx. it went very slow and too much ""big-ness"" in the ring. there were some nice big impact moves however but nothing really exciting in this one. 2/5

4. Ecw World Championship
Chavo Guererro vs. Kane
Kane hits the chokeslam on chavo and wins the ecw title in under 10 seconds, so... haha. 1/5

5. Ric Flair vs. Shawn Michaels
Probably the most emotional match of not this wrestlemania, but in wrestlemania history. it told an outstanding story throughout the match. you will see why hbk is called mr. wrestlemania in this match and you will also see why ric flair is the greatest wrestler ever. in my opinion this was the match of the night. heart felt match all the way but an outstanding match as well. 5/5

6. Bunny Maina Lumberjack Match
Maria and Ashley vs. Beth Pheonix and Melina
this match did not catch my attention whatsoever. very boring to me. but boy old boy i certainly miss seeing trish and lita at a wrestlemania. King does give santino a punch for his pressence, that was pretty funny. 1/5

7. WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Randy Orton vs. Triple H
many people wasn't really expecting this match to give anything special but overall it was pretty good . orton and triple h are great wrestlers, no doubt about it, so to me they gave the match some special-ness to it. everybody had their chance to showcase their ability. it did get pretty fierce in the beginning. i did not expect the ending though, thats for damn sure. pretty good match. 4.5/5

8. Big Show vs. Floyd Mayweather
this match was decent to me. not anything special to me besides the ending but it just wasn't your ""typical"" wrestling match. too much interference and big show not really showing mayweather what he can do in the ring. i also did not like the outcome whatsoever either but oh well. But some good quality entertainment right here. 3.5/5

9. World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs. Edge
now this match is what a wrestlemania match is all about. there was everything in this match from counters to submissions to close pin falls just everything. edge has really turned into a superior superstar and i was  very impressed to see him hang toe to toe in there with the undertaker. a great wrestlemania main event, unlike the past 2 or 3. tremendous match to end the show.(16-0). 5/5

Wrestlemania was great. I recommend this when released on DVD.",1207267200,,3497,4.5792
3311027,5,B00124ONF6,"This was by far the best Wrestlemania...perhaps I'm biased because I was actually THERE on the floor (and also at the Hall of Fame Ceremony the night before), but the overall caliber of matches has been far higher than those of the last three to four Wrestlemanias.  Pretty good considering that it rained there the majority of the time during the event!

I'm not going to go into detail on every match, but I will admit I was torn on which one stole the show.  It's a toss up between the Money in the Bank ladder match and Ric Flair's final match (the sole reason I flew almost 4000 miles to Orlando).  The MITB had some of the best spots I've seen in a match in a long time, and the retirement match...well it's up there simply for the ending...its historic.  I can now tell my kids when they grow up and get into wrestling that their dad was at Ric Flair's final match as well as his induction into the Hall of Fame.

And I'm not ashamed to say it, I cried at the Hall of Fame and I cried after the match...I'm sure anyone who was there would say it too.

I can't wait for the DVD.  Hopefully I can go to Wrestlemania next year in Houston...we shall see.  In the meantime, most definately five stars.",1207094400,,1203,4.241228070175438

THE UNDERTAKER- FINALLLY!!! smackdown the better brand of the wwe, yup i said it, was the main event and im happy it was. this waas definatly the match of the night i loved every minute of it. i think these guys put on a show. i was expecting the undertaker to carry edge the whole match but edge did awsome. im also happy the headgeheads didn't interfear that much it was a match u had to stand up for. it mad my heart jump at some points. 10/10

this mania was ok i would buy it only for the last match and somemore hate to see flair go and awsome lights and pyro.i think its a buy!!",1206921600,,2770,4.158878504672897
3311029,4,B00124ONF6,"The 24 man battle royal for the second Smackdown world title was first. Its t$he ECW title but I refuse to call it that. Kane wins.

JBL VS Finaly: A decent match. It would have been a logical Wrestlemania choice to have Hornswoggle come back in the end and assisst Finaly in the win. I guess writers were on vaction at Disney World. Hornswoggle comes out with Finaly instead. JBL win in a match that could be shown on Raw or Smackdown.

Money in The Bank: The highlight of every show since it was introduced. This match is not a match at all; It gets it share of highlights but thr matches always come off sloppy and you lose track of whats going on with certain wrestlers. The ladder they used seemed weake and wouldn't hold u in a few spots. Matt Hardy returns to attack MVP is a highlight. CM Punk wins, I wonder if he is still in the dog house now.

Batista VS Umaga: I love Batista but this match was pointless. It could have been on Raw or Smackdown.

Kane VS Chavo Guerrero: A pointless match and it buried ECW even more. Sandman, Raven, Team 3-D, Rhino, and other ECW aluminis should have stormed the ring and beat the crap out of both men. Remember when Diesel won the world title in 8 seconds ans then almost put WWE out of buisness? His feud with Mabel? Point is, Kane just put the final nail in ECW'S coffin. CM Punk is going to Raw and its already top heavy with talent.
I'm sure Kane will have feuds with Big Daddy V, Mark Henry, and Great Khali on ECW will be five star classics.

Ric Flair VS HBK: HBK and Flair put on a classic match. You had to be there to feel the emotion that was going in the match and thru out the crowd. Awesome match that will be a highlight for years to come.

Bunnymania: The lights went out during this match. Was it power or God saying NEXT!

HHH VS John Cena VS Randy Orton: I had no idea who would win this match. Thats why I was looking foward to this one. I like being surprised and surprise, Orton wins! A rematch at the next PPV im sure.  A very good match with Orton retaining the title in the end. I consider that a surprise.

Money Mayweather VS Big Show: I could careless about this match. This is the reason why some people bought this PPV. Mayweather wins via knock out and left room for a rematch. Oh boy.

A spoiler to WWE fans: TNA'S Ron Killings recently wrestled a dark match for WWE. I don't know if they signed him but it would have been great to have him come out and help Mayweather. Im sure the Orlando TNA crowd would have loved it.

The Undertaker VS Edge: With tha Raw title not changing hands, you knew 'Taker would win. I thought this was a classic and showed how great Edge could be. Im glad they put Smackdown in the main event. Raw may have by far the most talent, but Smackdown works its arse off and can put on excellent matches. A must see. Hopefully Undertaker won't get injuried during this run with the title.

Overall, a solid show. HBK VS Flair and Undertaker VS Edge were classics. A few pointless matches (ECW title, Bunnymania, and Umaga VS Batista) but still worth checking out.",1206921600,5,3066,4.240137221269297

3311031,5,B00124ONF6,"This is Wrestlemania 24. I almost didn't order it live because last year wasn't great and I didn't think it would be worthwhile.
My god, am I glad I did not miss it!

First of all, the open air style gave the show a certain quality and largesse I was only used to when watching old tapes of WM 3, for instance.
The opener was a Belfast Brawl between Finlay and JBL. I don't know if these two had a story together, at least it wouldn't be my favourite pairing. And ""Belfast Brawl"" is just another term for ""Hardcore Match"", which itself is just another term for ""ECW Light"". But anyway, as an opener it had enough punch to shake the audience a bit. Boring finale, though.
After a short interview with Mr. Kennedy, who announced he's going to be the first-ever WWE star to win two consecutive MITB Ladder Matches in a row, which is not THAT much of an achievement anyway, the seven contestants for the suitcase entered - MVP, John Morrison, CM Punk, Mr. Kennedy, Carlito, Chris Jericho and Shelton Benjamin.
Is it just me, or do always the same guys compete every year? You could almost think Vince McMahon wants to say ""Well, these guys could theoretically become World Champions, but unfortunately they suck quite badly.""
When Jericho came out, I though this was a farce, of course he's going to win! Guess what? He didn't. After the usual back and forth, and also some  quite cool new moves with the ladders, Jericho gets trapped in the ladder and CM Punk grabs the suitcase.
I foresee doom ...

I also expected doom in the ECW Title match between Chavo Guerrero and Kane, who won the Battle Royal earlier on. Fortunately, WWE decided to spare the audience some stiff wrestling and ended the match in circa ten seconds. Kane suddenly appeared in the ring, chokeslammed Chavo and won the belt.
I don't even care anymore what the hell they do to ECW, seems to me like it has become a home for stranded superstars.

Next on the card was Batista Vs. Umaga. I have absolutely zero idea why Umaga was still pushed as the big bad monster before this match, the guy has lost weight and is now more than slightly inferior to Batista, as far as the body constitution is concerned; the wrestling skills of both men on the other hand are equally meager.
And I didn't get the storyline behind it, since I don't watch the weekly shows. Apparently some branding rights were on the line, and for a split second I felt transported back in time, into the days when the RAW Vs. Smackdown angle was on its death bed.
The match was exactly like would have expected. Just under ten minutes, power wrestling, and a victory for Batista.

A promo was played for the Carreer-ending match between Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels, followed by the actual match.
Was I the only one? Was I the only one who cried afterwards? I can't have been the only small boy in front of a television screen, watching the first ever match between Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair back in 1993. I can't have been the only boy who was glued to the TV late at night, much to the distress of my parents, watching Ric Flair style 'n profile. Back in the days when everything was real, when everything was grand, fascinating and enticing.
Even in WCW's darkest hour, Ric Flair transcended the whole misery, gracing every match he was in.
Surely I wasn't the only one who felt that!
The match itself was irrelevant, it was wrestling like we love it, with intensity, tension and above all passion; what really matters, and what grabbed me and the audience by the heart was the ending. Before super-kicking Flair to the final pinfall, Shawn looked into his face and repeatedly said ""I'm sorry"". Even before Charles Robinson (of course he would officiate Ric Flair's last match!) started the count, you could see that Flair broke character and started to break out in tears. Immediately after the three-count, Michaels moved close to his face and told him something we will probably never know.
As Flair moved around the ring crying, thanking the audience, kissing his children, who also wept, the crowd applauded and I could not hold myself back.
And thus, the era Flair was ended.

Even now, in his declining years, Flair was able not only to overshadow the grandest stage of them all, but also to create the first true, historic Wrestlemania moment since many, many, many years!
Having been introduced into the Hall Of Fame the night before, the moment to end the carreer couldn't be more perfect.
Thank you, Ric, from the bottom of my heart! For your passion, your skills - you will never be forgotten!

There was no way anything could come even close to this experience, so WWE put the ""Bunnymania Lumberjill"" Tagteam Match on the card next.
The divas came out, accompanied by Snoop Dogg, so you knew what to expect, and I will not comment any further.
WWE just needs to realise that if someone wants girls to jiggle around with funny moves in sexy dresses, you'll be better advised to rent a softcore porno.

I was a wee bit surprised that the Three-Way Match for the WWE Championship was not the main event.
John Cena's theme song was performed live by some local capella, I assume, and it was so crippled that I didn't even recognise it at first. Apparently, neither did the audience, which is a shame because I love the sudden burst of Boos when the first strains play.
Triple H and Randy Orton were somehow underdogs in my mind, I really expected Cena to win yet again. The match was as good as a WWE Triple Threat currently gets, it was very good, actually. You could have wished for a better build-up to the finale, but apart from this little dent, it was a four star matchup; also because Cena actually didn't win.

Big Show Vs. Floyd Mayweather was in my eyes a positive surprise. It was entertaining, funny, tight and believable. Ironically, Mayweather has more charisma than many musclemachines that pass off as superstars in WWE today.

Now the main event. Purely on paper, Undertaker Vs. Edge doesn't sound very promising. And in the first third of the match, you had every right to fear the worst, since it meandered along quite slowly. Fortunately, things picked up pretty soon and it became a very good match. Whether it was worthy of a WM main event, that's a debatable point, but it was leagues better than 90% of WWE's PPV main events last year.
Since Taker was injured shortly after he won the title at WM 23, he had every right to reclaim the title tonight, and so he did.

The event closed with a stunning firework over, outside and in the bowl. The reason I give this event five stars is not because of the matches, also not because of the title matches, but simply because Ric Flair's ended carreer alone justifies the existence of the WM. It will be remembered; it had a fantastic atmosphere; the matches ranked from okay to very good; and Ric Flair finally and truly acquired immortality, which will make this event legendary.",1206835200,3,6892,4.57246963562753

Belfast Brawl
JBL vs Finlay

Hornswaggle came back with Finlay. Those two put on a very good brawl. They used a table, trash can lids, steel step, and the sheligh. The both of them took some hard shots with the trash ncan lids. Very good opener but I wished Mr. Mcmahon was there because it really didn't fell reight without him. But good. Overall 8.5/10

Money in the Bank Ladder match
Shelton Benjamin, Chris Jericho, MVP, CM Punk, Carlito, John Morrison, and Mr. Kennedy .............. Kennedy!!!

This was not the best Money in the bank match but it was still okay. Shelton took a huge crash through the ladder like hardy and edge last year. It really looked like MVP was going to win but, Matt Hardy made his return and twist of fated him off the ladder. It got good towards the end but I was disappointed with the winner but oh well. Overall 7.5/10

Raw vs Smackdown
Umaga vs Batista

This was not good as expected. Pretty much Umaga dominated Batista through out the match until Batista came back towards the end and spinebuster and a horrible batista bomb. Bad match. Overall 3.5/10

ECW Championship match
Chavo Guerro vs Kane
Heres what exactly happens. Kane sneaks up behind him and chokes slam him and 1,2,3 your new champion. The big red machine Kane. Overall 5/10 , 10/10 for Kane finally wining a major championship.

Ric Flair vs Shawn MIcheals

These two put on one of tonights exciting match but also a emotional one. Shawn tried to do a moonsault to Flair but missed and possibly broke his ribs. I was very surprise with Flair because it must have been over a 20 minute match and He kept in the there. The both of them put out some loud chops to. I was very glad that Flair had his last match at Wrestlemania because he put on one of the greatest matches at Wrestlemania. It also got very emotional after the match. Overall 10/10

Bunnymania Lumberjill match
Maria and Ashley vs Beth Phoenix and Melina

This was a bad follow up to a fantastic match but oh well. This was even worst than Umaga vs Batista. It did look like they tried but didn't try hard enough. Plus the lights went out towards the middle of the match which was horrible. After the match was sort of funny with snoop dogg close lining Satino. Overall 2/10

Triple Threat Match
WWE Championship match
John Cena vs Triple H vs Randy Orton

Cena comes out with a drum line band which was preety nice. This wasn't like the triple threat at Wrestlemania 20 but it was good enough to watch. Orton did a double ddt to the both of them which was cool. Cena tried a double fu but they revered that. It was kind of strange because I knew Cena was going in there with a mixed reaction from the crowd but he is also the only one who got a reaction from the crowd. Good match. Overall 7.5/10

NO DQ match
Big Show vs Floyd Maywheather

At first I thought this was going to be a bad match but it wasn't . It was way better than the Bunnymania and Raw vs Smackdown matches. It stared out slow but really picked up. I was very excited when Big Show dished out pain towards Floyd and his crew. He gave out slams,  chops,  elbow,  chokeslams, and etc. All of a sudden hes hit with a chair and brass knuckles. Still very good of a surprise match. Overall 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship match
The Undertaker vs Edge

This was the most intensed match I have ever seen. Going into the match it really looked like taker was going to loose at Wrestlemania which would start a riot. Edge countered every single move Undertaker tried to do. It got very heart pounding towards the end when Undertaker hit the tombstone and the referee was running to the ring. Undertaker wins out of nowhere when Edge speared Undertaker and turned it into a gogoplata to make him tap out. I'm really glad they put this match last because taker deserved that because of last year. Tie Match of the night with Flair and Micheals. Overall 10/10.",1206835200,3,3988,4.451923076923077
