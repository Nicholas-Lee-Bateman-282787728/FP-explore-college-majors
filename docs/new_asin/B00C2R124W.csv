5689059,4,B00C2R124W,I bought this movie for my grandchildren to watch when they come over to my house to stay the night or for a weekend.,1376524800,,117,3.9166666666666665
5689060,3,B00C2R124W,"Josh (Louis Corbett) visits his archeologist father (Sam Neill) in China. He plays the victim of his parents divorce for some reason that was never developed. Here he meets Ling (Li Lin Jin) and if you read the title you know there is a dragon and a pearl they are tasked with reuniting.

I imagine the idea was to combine the beauty and artistry of the Chinese cinema and give it a plot that won't confuse westerners who don't understand the real complexity of good and evil. The film did not do as well of a job as I had hoped. The artistry was only in a few scenes and the plot was western formulaic. The on screen chemistry never happened. It was forced. Wu Dong (Jordan Chan) the temple keeper was the only one with on screen personality.

I can't imagine a lot of kids wanting to see this more than once. I did like the drumming at the end during the credit roll. Might make for a rental on family night.",1374278400,,910,4.254335260115607
5689061,4,B00C2R124W,"This Australian-Chinese collaboration offers kids the chance to be the heroes in a mystical land.

An Austalian boy comes to stay with his archaelogical father(Sam Neill) in China, while equally, a Chinese girl visits her mother at the dig site.  At first the kids are put off by each other but soon join forces at the discovery that the girl has a ancient calling with an emperor and a dragon.

They follow an odd man(Jordan Chan) with a flute that only the girl can hear and unearth the lair of a dragon, much to the disbelief of their respective parents and cross paths with some bad guys set on obtaining the powerful pearl of the title.

It's a bit slow in parts.  Humor provided by famous Chinese actor/dancer, Chan, not Jackie, made our kids giggle; the dragon is a Chinese dragon, no wings, more noble  and elegant looking than our western versions; the stunts and special effects are ok.  I liked the scenery, the story was  putting me out, but the kids(6 & 9) liked it.

The Australian director, Mario Andreacchio, appears to know what kids like, and keeps the danger to PG level and adds comedy to soften the threats.  All ends well with parent-child bonding and dragon satisfaction.  3 1/2 stars. Chinese drummers perform during the credits.  No special features.",1373155200,9,1275,4.693693693693693
5689062,5,B00C2R124W,"I rented this movie for my 8 yr. old daughter and myself. We are now watching it for the second time. We both really think this is a great movie. This is an adventure movie with a twist. Things are not always as they seem, and the ending is wonderful. We would recommend this to any family who love a good family movie with a great plot. There is some fighting in the beginning and the end. You just have to realize that this is a movie.",1372982400,6,437,4.0344827586206895

5689076,5,B00C2R124W,"I love stories like this where there is adventure, archeology, and some magic and mysterious elements. I was not expecting much from this production. But I was very pleasantly surprised. The dragon is well done and you have sympathy for his plight  and that of the children. Coming from a joint Australian and Chinese venture, the sets and artifacts were very convincing. The music is very good but the drumming is exceptional, especially at the end. The movie is worth it just to see the drumming. A very satisfying movie. When I opened the case, the blu-ray was hidden by the vudu code sheet, and so the first time around I watched the dvd edition. When I realized my mistake, I decided to watch it over again with the blu-ray so  I can confidently say that the blu-ray makes the movie much better. I have a 3D player and screen so I'm not sure whether it enhanced the movie but  the blu-ray is very well done and worth buying even if you have the dvd.",1459036800,2,954,4.44

I was astonished that there was scene after scene of this beautiful creature-creation.  Many people don;t know that the Oriental Sky Dragons are benevolent characters, not like the European pestilence associated dinosaur-like ""dragons""  .....(except oriental red river dragons)..This is a great family movie. (And there are 2 girl characters too)  One of my favorite movies!",1403222400,9,537,5.126436781609195

5689114,3,B00C2R124W,Got this because it seemed like a goog family story but was disappointed in it and decided not to keep it in my collection so will be reselling it for what I paid for it. The story seemed lame and the charactors seemed weak in their rolls. the graphics of the dragon was lame. I thought it could have been better.,1391212800,,313,4.147540983606557

5689116,5,B00C2R124W,"My 6 yr old loves this movie! Shows some beautiful scenes of China and has sparked all of our interests into the Chinese culture. I read some reviews stating that this film was slow and boring, but I found it to be completely entertaining and wonderful family film. It's clean and free of questionable or crude material. It offers light hearted jokes and comic relief. The special effects and fight scenes aren't super amazing by any means, but they are able to convey the thrill and story line without violent or explicit scenes. We all enjoyed this film  so much after renting it that we decided to buy it to add to our family collection. It's one you won't mind letting your kids watch again and again.",1388620800,,705,4.551181102362205

5689121,4,B00C2R124W,"I like dragons and I am delighted to see oriental dragons that are a bit more elegant than the typical medieval European scaly lizard thing.  Not a lot is shown of the dragon other than ""air swimming"" but that part is very nicely done and the whole reason for having this movie.

Views of China, or so I suppose, are beautiful and nicely done.  The story is, as others have written, slightly predictable but no worse for it.  It is a slightly forced ""papa doesn't believe but the bad guy believes"" story designed to induce guilt in parents that don't subscribe to every wild story told by their imaginative teens.  Anyway, papa could have listened without disparaging his son and without a lot of disruption on his own life.  It doesn't have to be quite so sharply demarked -- but they'd have no story that way.",1381104000,,811,4.52054794520548

8576671,4,B00C2R124W,"This is a low budget Australian kids movie set in China but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.  It's pretty formulaic as a kids save the day, parents learn and apologise for not believing their kids or listening to their solution to a problem because they are too busy genre movie.  Basically two Australian kids have caught different flights to China for the holidays, one whose father is played by Sam Neil is of European descent, the other has Chinese heritage.  Ignoring every stranger danger thing he's learnt in school the boy willingly gets a lift with a woman he's never seen before (the girl's mother) after she tells him she works with his father and he could not make it to the airport.  He as well as the girl will continue to get in strangers cars and go into a building with a man they've never met throughout the film. At one point after the boy wakes and walks out on his room's balcony a guy in a tinted windowed black SUV car points to him and waves for him to come, he points to himself do you mean me, the guy nods and he just goes down stairs and gets in his car.  Another time they go down a hole into a guy's floor after he tells one of them she is the chosen one.

But anyway it's quite a good kid viewer level (as in we know nothing bad will happen) danger wise and threat from bad guys film.  I liked how the film acknowledged what you were thinking at times like, the dragon not going to have seen a white kid before, and the girl mentions (since he doesn't speak the language) the dragon is wondering what you are.  The budget is low so it is fairly obvious kids are in front of a green screen at times, or they are in a city, but a short bike ride away they are in a rural looking with hills everywhere and no buildings landscape.  But I liked how unlike a lot of kids movies these days, the kids are played by actors who actually look like kids.  The Chinese Dragon looks quite good too although obvious CGI.  I did wonder though if a dragon can just fly up and into the sky from where it has been hidden, why no one else ever came across it by not going through the secret chosen one way, but that doesn't wreck the film's enjoyment factor or anything. I liked how they are prepared to have in the dialogue, such as the flute guy's play on the surprised, OMG saying with the replacement, Oh My Buddha!",1482969600,,2340,4.212527964205816
