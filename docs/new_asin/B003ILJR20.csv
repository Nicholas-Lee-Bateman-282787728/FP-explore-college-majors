8397458,5,B003ILJR20,Hatmaker is the best at what he does.  He presents this material at a steady pace that holds your interest.  As with all of his work he has clearly done his research and tested his material on the mat. Some University ought to give this man an honorary professorship in Grappling.,1357516800,4,280,4.470588235294118
8397459,5,B003ILJR20,This series has some good escapes.  The windmill escape for the head and arm position is something which I think I could have use a while ago to get out of a tough hold.  The guillotine escape is interesting.  This has some techniques which are worth trying out.,1351555200,4,262,4.416666666666667
