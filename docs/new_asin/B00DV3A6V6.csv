5858856,5,B00DV3A6V6,"This beautifully shot concert demonstrates the power and ferocity of the newest incarnation of The Smashing Pumpkins.  I doubt anyone could see this material and still argue that the old members were better.  Jeff, Nicole, and Mike more than hold their own, and display their musical versatility, each playing at least two different instruments throughout the show.  They bring a fresh, vibrant feel even to the older material.  The 3D-2D Blu-Ray offers exceptional audio and video quality, making you feel like you're seeing the performance in person.  This is a must-have for all PumpkinHeads!",1380240000,7,595,5.287234042553192
5858857,5,B00DV3A6V6,"Recieved the blu-ray on the day it was released since I had pre-ordered it.  I have seen the Pumpkins in concert several times including the Oceania tour.  Great editing and filming of the concert. All the concerts on the tour started by playing the Oceania album from start to finish, then a nice mix of greatest hits. My favorite was the slow tempo version of Hummer that was only on the set list of the last few dates of the tour.  The camera angles were a nice mix of crowd shots, close up of the band members playing, and the center stage view that included the globe hanging over the drummer that had neat video feeds on it.  Since the concert was the one in New York city that was originally scheduled for Halloween night and got re scheduled because of Hurricane Sandy, they included shots of the New York city subway system to tie it together with the Brooklyn setting.  However they showed several scenes of the Washington DC subway system mixed in for some reason. Great show, Great disk",1380153600,3,998,4.49171270718232
5858858,5,B00DV3A6V6,"I saw this concert in Melbourne, Australia and had to fly interstate, it was so worth it! I was hoping the Pumpkins would release a DVD/blu ray of this tour as it was unbelievable, I want to relive it over and over again. I can't wait for it to come out and I will get the 3d blu ray and the cd version, can never have enough of this band. Old pumpkins fans should embrace this and move forward with them. The new stuff is awesome and the old classics will never disappoint. GET IT!!!",1376870400,4,484,4.105263157894737
5858859,5,B00DV3A6V6,"I was at the show at Barclay Center and the concert was awesome! I saw them filming in 3D, so went out and bought new LG TV and DVD player.

5858860,1,B00DV3A6V6,"The DVD of this concert includes audio CDs, but yet, the Blu-ray does Not come with CDs.  So, if a fan wants the CDs + the Blu-ray, we have to buy TWO DIFFERENT ITEMS??  WTF?? Lame.  Marketing fail. ...or, marketing Success, depending which side you're on! :P",1375833600,21,259,4.468085106382978
5858861,5,B00DV3A6V6,"I know this video doesn't come out for 53 days (not that I'm counting), but I just have to say how excited I am that SP have decided to give us a high quality concert video from the recent tour. I was lucky enough to have seen them during the Oceania tour, and it was amazing. Extremely powerful. Reminded me a bit of a show I saw of them back in 1996 during the MCIS tour. The music felt so raw back then, and it still does now. The new band lineup is incredible. Mike's take on the drums brings something new, even to the old songs -- and I love it every bit as much as I did back when Jimmy was on the kit.

I have no doubt that the quality of this video will be mind-blowing. Can't wait to slow-motion and zoom in on Billy's fingers during solos, especially when he's rocking phasers on the solo to Oceania. This is going to be awesome!

So proud of my favorite band (err, Billy) for sticking to his music, fans, and truth through all these years.",1373587200,15,951,4.080213903743315

5858905,1,B00DV3A6V6,I have been a SP fan since 1990.  I love Oceania.  This concert is absolutely terrible.  It is unfortunate because this is the only Oceania concert you can buy that I know of.  Stay away.,1390521600,2,187,4.257142857142857
5858906,5,B00DV3A6V6,"This show rocks. If you are a fan of the ""new"" Pumpkins this set doesn't let you down. Would have loved a few more classic tracks, but it's still worth the money if you are a big fan. Corgan sounds and looks great... (I saw someone above ripping on him for his weight... Let's see how the rest of us look when we are in our 40s....) Now they need to release the full ""final show"" from the Metro on Blu Ray.

5858909,5,B00DV3A6V6,"I stumbled upon this in my Amazon recommendations and being a bit of a concert collector, decided to give this a try. I was familiar with the radio hits (Bullet, Zero, Cherub Rock etc.) and always admired Billy Corgan's uncompromising approach to his music.
The bands performance and in particular, Jeff Schroeder and Mike Byrne really stood out. What a concert! I loved it all.
The production on display here is one of the absolute best in my massive collection. The stage design, quality of video and editing is very impressive. The True HD 5.1 on here is remarkable! Great separation and balance in the mix. All instruments are rendered with stunning fidelity and in particular, the dirty distortion of the guitars just screams out of my speakers with just the right amount of aggression and presence.
I'm a new fan, and this will be in heavy rotation in my player for a while.",1386720000,2,880,4.720779220779221

I have two gripes about this. There should have been a Blu-ray/CD combo and secondly, I would have loved there to be a option to keep the video on just the cameras around Mike Byrne.

5858922,5,B00DV3A6V6,"This CD totally rocked me. The only thing I'll even begin to complain about is that on my favorite track from, ""Oceania"", a song called ""The Chimera"", the band seems to rush the tempo a bit. All in all though, this DVD is a capturing of a marvelous performance! It has the complete Oceania CD performed live, plus a handful of grat Smashing Pumpkins ""classics"".",1383523200,2,361,4.569230769230769

The Audio is 24 Bit rate, one of the best quality live audio tracks I've ever heard from SP. This band is super tight and the musicianship is superb. Billy and the rest of his band are virtuoso's. Just watch that drummer, he's insane.. The song order (Oceania first - the Hits second) is exactly how the concert was performed.. just awesome !",1382659200,3,489,4.202127659574468

5858926,3,B00DV3A6V6,"I'm digging the new album but it would've been nice to mix the set up a bit more. More Machina, more everything! Last half was spankin'",1382400000,,135,4.230769230769231
5858927,4,B00DV3A6V6,"It took the better part of a decade and a myriad of line-up changes to pull it off, but with the release of last year's ""Oceania,"" Billy Corgan finally achieved commercial and critical acceptance again with The Smashing Pumpkins. As alternative rock's self-appointed curmudgeon, Corgan has fought an uphill battle to be taken seriously for decades now, and it's with that mindset that he took to the road with his current line-up (Jeff Schroeder on guitar, Nicole Fiorentino on bass and Mike Byrne on drums) and an expansive (and expensive) stage set-up to perform ""Oceania"" in its entirety, from front to back, night after night. Whether they wanted to or not, audiences would have to ultimately accept this version of the Pumpkins as the real deal. This set captures their December 10th performance in New York City, completely unedited at 24 tracks long.

Sounds like: A healthy compromise of Corgan's past and his vision for the future.

The Good:

- Not only are you getting the rock-solid ""Oceania"" in its entirety, but a good chunk of Pumpkins classics. The second half of the set is as devoted to well-worn radio staples like ""Disarm"" and ""Tonight, Tonight"" as it is to slightly deeper cuts like ""X.Y.U."" and ""Hummer.""

- The ""new"" Pumpkins more than hold their own, effortlessly pulling off ""Oceania"" while giving new life so the classics as well.

- The visuals are a real treat, especially during ""Tonight, Tonight"" which recalls the song's iconic music video.

The Bad:

- Billy's skin-tight wrestling shirt gives way to copious amounts of muffin top and coin-slot. Next time, leave the skin-tight outfits to Nicole.

- Billy is clearly phoning it in on the likes of ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" and ""Cherub Rock."" Don't like playing the Pumpkins tunes? Stop calling it Pumpkins. It's time to reconcile what you think the band should be and what everyone else wants it to be.

- Pointless cut-scenes of the New York Subway system in action are vexing. This visual addendum has all the appeal of a high-school student's film-class project.

Hits:

- New track, ""The Dream Machine"" is absolutely stunning. A big, bold and moody prog-rock jam that recalls the lost ""Gossamer"" and ""As Rome Burns."" Even if this song never gets recorded, you get a professionally recorded version of it with this set.

- The ""Oceania"" title-track surpasses its studio counterpart, which gives hope to this ""young"" band's future.

- The set closes out with ""Hummer"" (before the prerequisite encore, of course). Let that sink in for a second. ""Hummer."" The only song that would have made for a better exit would be ""Mayonaise."" Sometimes, just sometimes, Billy really knows how to reconnect with his past.

Misses:

- A cover of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" is fine and all, but with so many Pumpkins classics to sift through, it seems a waste of time. It works well in transitioning from the ""Oceania"" material to the ""Classic"" set, but perhaps this is where ""Starla"" could have fit in.

- Nothing from ""Gish"" or either of the two ""Machina"" albums. For shame Billy, for sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame. Then again, nothing from ""Teargarden,"" so that's something, right?

Best Listened To When: You have some nostalgia pains but want to hear something current at the same time.

Personally:

The Smashing Pumpkins have always been a favorite and all criticisms aside, Billy Corgan is still one of the greatest song-writers of his era. Having seen this exact same show in Portland, ME (minus the orb), it's a nice treat to have this memento. Granted, as far as all-time greatest Pumpkins shows go, you could do better. Check out the '93 Metro show from the ""Siamese Dream"" re-issue for proof.

The Bottom Line(s):

The ""Oceania"" tour was a nice compromise between old and new Pumpkins, and if you still nurse a soft spot for the ""Siamese Dream""/""Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness"" days, this performance is likely to win you over.

Note: The Blu-Ray version does NOT include the audio CD(s), whereas the DVD version does. Go figure.",1381622400,20,4012,4.903846153846154
5858928,5,B00DV3A6V6,"If you like mean, clean, hard rock music with lots of screaming lead guitar, this one is for you.
This is Billy Corgan but, NOT the Smashing Pumpkins music you remember from the 90's.
This is some of the best, well rounded rock played lately and definitely not a lot of percussive rhythm guitars with hardly any lead like most current rock bands try to get by with these days.

It would've been cool to have interviews with the band or behind-the-scenes footage of the band preparing. Also, at times, the audio and video seem out of sync.

That is all for the positives about this concert. I can not remember if Billy Corgan and the band is less passionate than the crowd but the whole thing has a completely zombified air about it. I won't complain about it mostly being Oceania songs and not more of the classics we all want to hear because that was obvious from the tracklist, and the fact that every single classic Billy sings sounds absolutely atrocious. Again, passionless. The soundtrack is a bit off with his voice, with some tinkering it gets better but it is very hard to hear. Why is the stage so cluttered? This is a performance and it looks like a garage set up (but not in a way that would be cool, neat or awesome). Why is everyone dressed to go to the mall in the 90's?

The tour is a good representation of the album/touring lineup of this era, but the Smashing Pumpkins at their greatest is/was all about the extreme highs, and lows. The lineup felt a little too ""6 or 7 out of 10"" for me.  Pretty consistent, but the peaks are not as high (and the lows are also not as lows).
