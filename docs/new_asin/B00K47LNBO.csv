The good news plenty of edwidge Fensch and Rosabela Neri doing what they do best. The story is about a group of crooks on a boat who will do anything to get rich.the women head of the gang has a retarded son who she feels will get better if he gets some sex.the majority of the movie is about trying to get him laid with a young girl they find on an island after they become temporarily shipwrecked.they have to murder her husband because the slow kid appears to like the young girl.the results are not what they expect as the retarded kid kills the young girl.there is also a suprise ending",1507680000,,742,4.2695035460992905
8655809,4,B00K47LNBO,"Please note:  this review is based upon the version released by the British 'Shameless' video that I purchased from Amazon-UK!  Certain elements and features may differ from the version advertised/pictured on the Amazon.com U.S. based website!  This is a Region 2 PAL format DVD and will require a 'region free' DVD player (or computer) to view it.

The SHAMELESS DVD authoring gang have done a great job of re-assembling this late '60's 'video-nasty' and making it available for modern viewing.  The film is presented in its' original full-screen format and the majority of the picture quality is very sharp with brilliant colours.  There are a few, obvious, 'inserts' of, previously, cut/censored scenes where the visual quality is markedly degenerated - but the total run time for these degraded quality scenes is likely less than a minutes worth of the entire show.  Of course these scenes display snippets of nudity and the 'infamous' erotic goat footage - which is actually pretty innocuous.

Interestingly, for a film that purportedly deals with all manner of 'perversity' - eg: incest, lesbianism, murder, bestiality, etc. - the 'vibe' is remarkably 'lite'.  The majority of the action takes place aboard a yacht with a 'crew' of (mostly) attractive young folk.  There is some mention of 'oil exploration' on a relatively deserted isle as a rational for 'why' the boat & its' inhabitants are where it is at - but that plays little role in the actual goings on of the libidinous crew - who seem very caught up in their own sexual frolics.  The folks on the boat include a 'mother' figure and her neurotic son, a cute blond guy, and two smokin' hot  babes played by Edwige Fenech and Rosalba Neri.  When their craft becomes 'grounded' off a small island the boat people go ashore and end up shooting some domestic goats, and luring a young peasant girl (and ultimately her husband) out onto their vessel...  where the 'sophisticated'  yacht folk take sexual advantage of the simple island couple, ultimately leading to a grim conclusion.

What makes watching this rather pointless bit of trivial Italian exploitation cinema worthwhile is pretty much just the copious amounts of flesh displayed by all of the female members of the cast. The aquatic setting allows the 2 principal female leads to prance about in bikinis throughout the entire production and there are numerous situations where the scant swim-wear is removed for applying sun tan lotion or pursuing other more erotic games.  Ms Neri sports a stunning golden harem slave ensemble in one early-on lesbic scene. While there is the odd flash of breasts & butts there is no full on female nudity and all of the sex scenes are decidedly soft-core fare.

I watched the show with the English dubbed soundtrak - which was murky - but nothing 'important' was ever actually said so it didn't seem too much of an issue.  The disk includes a nice 'extra' featurette that provides 2 of the films original actors (including Rosalba!) reminiscing about their experiences filming 'Top Sensation' back in the day. While this DVD may fall a little short on the 'extreme perversity' per the hype on its' box cover - it is a pleasurable enuf viewing experience - thanks to the pulchritude provided by the female stars - and might be recommended for addition to one's collection of Euro-weirdness.",1483056000,3,3345,4.941071428571429
