896762,2,6304539452,"This is another movie that seemed to suffer of the ""Pulp Fiction"" effect, as it pretty much relies on attitude, cool badass characters, stylish cinematography and edgy music to give mood. The story, however, isn`t that great, turning into an average betrayal plot that doesn`t bring nothing new or too memorable, and is a bit too slow. Some good moments still occur, though, and the acting is alright, with talents like Eric Stoltz, James Spader, Mary Tyler Moore and even a then unnoticed Cameron Diaz. So, ""Keys To Tulsa"" is a decent indie movie that`s neither too surprising nor too disappointing, another one to watch at a rainy night.",1075680000,,639,4.871559633027523
896763,1,6304539452,"I bought this movie because I collect movies with Cameron Diaz and I can say it was disapointing. She appears during one minute at the beginning and never again!
I didn't find any interest in the story, and I was yawning all the time. How boring can this be?",1057104000,,258,4.285714285714286
896764,1,6304539452,"the story is boring and stupid, the actors act very bad, except Cameron Diaz, but we only see her 5 minutes.",1056499200,,108,4.190476190476191
896765,5,6304539452,"It's offensive that Cameron Diaz is on the cover of this thing, when her mediocre part is over just about as soon as the credits.
Joanna Going gave her all, meanwhile, and isn't mentioned on the box at all.  I bought the DVD to see her, and every red-blooded male out there bought it for the same reason.  Who are they kidding with this Cameron Diaz jazz?  It's a taut mystery story, too, with real characters in an unreal situation.  I loved it.",1042934400,,446,4.337349397590361
896766,1,6304539452,"Just how bad can a movie starring James Coburn (who would win the Oscar for ""Affliction,"" also 1997), Mary Tyler Moore, Eric Stoltz, James Spader and Deborah Unger (more effective as a married couple in ""Crash""), Michael Rooker (""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""), Joanna Going and, in a bit part, a pre-""There's Something About Mary"" Cameron Diaz be? Far worse  than I thought. I have no idea why these actors, who've all done better work elsewhere, would have agreed to star in such a stinker. Easily one of the more inept entries in the overcrowded post-""Pulp Fiction"" dying-to-be-hip black comic neo-noir derby.

Stoltz, saddled with a bad haircut and the unfortunate name of Richter Boudreau, is completely miscast as a reporter who mostly just walks around with his shirt open, and his love scenes with Vicky (Unger) and Cherry (Going) are pretty tepid, especially in the scene where Going's punk rock stripper character drags herself over a plate of sausage and eggs en route to a morning quickie (can you say yuck?).

And the film isn't even half as interesting as I've made it sound! Cinematography and soundtrack are competent, but the story doesn't make sense, dialogue is DOA, characters uninteresting, direction listless, and actors bored. Only some morbid and compulsive form of curiosity kept me going until the very end. Not even bad-good.",967593600,,1358,5.026666666666666

7873873,4,6304539452,Very strange movie with great actors in it.,1432771200,,43,4.5
7873874,5,6304539452,I show this movie years ago. James Spader plays a bad boy ex-con type. He does a wonderful job of it. He has also black hair which he looks really hot. His wife cheats and so does he. He has a plan to black mail this one man that killed a call girl. But it back fires and  this man that murdered he girl comes after him and trys to kill him.,1392681600,,341,3.736111111111111
7873875,3,6304539452,"The movie is good with superb/stunning - to say the least- acting of Joanna Going. James Spader is - well, ""OK"". It is just great to see James Coburn again, and the musical score is fine. The movie in itself is based on a script - which surprises me, it could have been a sponaneous home movie someone made during a weekend - that is poor or even worse. At best, this film is amusing as long as you can push ""forward"" most of the time. The performances mentioned above are well worth the buck, though.",1351382400,,501,4.229166666666667
7873876,4,6304539452,"Reinventing the wheel is not the priority of this little straight-to-video from 96'. The ""Key"" point in me seeing this movie was Joanna Going. Who surprisingly to know was around 34 when she made this movie, as she looks more like 24. Adding insult to her great performance, despite her large role was that her name nor picture is anywhere to be found on the DVD.

Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz who only has a cameo that lasts a few minutes at the beginning of the film has second billing, and a huge spot on the front cover. So don't buy this movie for her if your a fan she's barely in this one.

Keys To Tulsa spends most of its two-hour length teetering on the brink of being a convoluted mess, but the wit and charm of the script and the cast combine to make it a worthwhile watch. There are a lot of characters with a lot of back story, and at times it's easy to forget who has done what to whom.

Still, I'd check it out if only to catch a glimpse of Joanna Going who is the hot point of this otherwise respectable movie.",1351209600,,1022,4.177664974619289
7873877,3,6304539452,"I wasn't expecting much based on the reviews here, but I have to say that I've seen a lot of worse movies than this.  Sure some of the dialogue is inane, some of the actors overact, and the direction uses too many cliche's (seems like everybody is either smoking, drinking, having sex or taking drugs in every scene).
Perhaps it is a reflection of the decadence and decline of the american civilization as a whole.  But this film isn't totally without merit.  While there are bad elements to it, I didn't find anything particularly terrible.  The older actors provided the best acting, imo.  And of course, I don't know why Joanna Going wasn't in the credits as her presence was basically heavy in the latter half of the film.  You do at least get the feeling that you are looking at a slice of midwest americana if nothing else
I will also say that this is one of the most sparse DVD's I've ever scene in terms of extras.  I guess the producers or manufacturer figured that the market for this film was too small to justify too many extras.",1286841600,,1041,4.447368421052632
