8707698,4,B00UO05DA8,"The film opens with Isabel Heller (Katie Nicole Evans) killing the Drownsman (Ry Barrett) aka Sebastian Donner. Okay film over. Not quite. Later, Madison (Michelle Mylett) has a near drowning incident in a lake where she sees the Drownsman, and develops an unnatural fear of all things liquid, yet manages to stay clean. Her friends decide to help, but end up unlocking our villain who moves between dimensions and emerges from water, reminding me of a cross between a no personality Freddie and Ghost Shark.

Madison must solve the horror mystery as her friends disappear.

The film is a decent horror film with a bad guy that could have been better. Michell Mylett gave a good performance down to the nervous cracking in her voice. She should be doing more than B horror and is clearly better than her support cast. Worth a view for horror fans. Should be watched by candlelight in a bathtub.
