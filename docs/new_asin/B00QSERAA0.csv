8692591,5,B00QSERAA0,This Russian mini-series is the most detailed film adoption of Fydor Dostoevsky's great masterpiece like only the Russians can do. The series consisting of 12 parts follows all of the novel's plots without leaving out the most dramatic parts or draging the pace as most film adaptions can do. The mini-series follows the Karamazov brothers from the conflict between the eldest son and his father to the father's murder and trial. All the characters are potrayed just as Dostoevsky wrote them without any changes that would come in a foreign production. Considered the by many the greatest and most influential novel ever written The Brother's Karamazov brings great drama and passions with all points of view and perspectives. This is the definate version to be seen by all lovers of Russian literature and film.,1418083200,4,812,5.067164179104478
