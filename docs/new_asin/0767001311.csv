3928,4,0767001311,"The Bob Newhart Show was one of the 10 best TV shows ever, and the picture quality in this 6-tape collection is very good. It's nice to see all the episodes in their uncut form, as opposed to the reprehensible syndication practice of cutting scenes to sell more commercial time. My only qualm with this collection is that there are only 2 episodes per tape. Hopefully there will be a DVD collection of this excellent series and the follow-up series, Newhart (1982-1990).",980380800,11,470,4.7439024390243905
3929,5,0767001311,"One of my top five favorite shows. It feels strange though because now I'm older than Bob was! So fun to watch again and it's great watching it on a 65"" tv. It's a little grainy as opposed to a high-definition show filmed today, but I prefer it that way because it takes me right back to the 1970's with Bob's green couch. But if you have a modern blu ray player with 'upconversion' it will smooth things out even more. Funny blooper: in one episode you can clearly see a camera & cameraman on the right side of the set for a couple seconds. The only real problem was that on just a couple episodes (season three I think) the audio wasn't in sync with the video. Barely off but just enough to be distracting. Fortunately only those episodes. I love the bonus features, especially the commentaries - only wish the Gag Reel was longer but I know they weren't thinking about DVD box sets back then. No problems with the discs and I inspected them all for damage like scratches or fingerprint smudges. That happened with another show I bought, but this packaging is very nice. I like the brown 'wood paneling' look of the box and the bonus booklet. The booklet is well made with a history of the show's beginnings and summary of each episode. Well worth the money. I've watched it twice!",1511395200,4,1283,4.417721518987341

3933,2,0767001311,"The series itself arguably merits 5 stars, but after trying to watch three, allegedly brand-new discs that had to ""skip over damaged areas,"" I gave up and returned the whole set for a refund. Shout! is respected for the quality of its products. I'm at a loss to interpret what happened.

REVISION OF PREVIOUS REVIEW: At times it is difficult in Amazon reviews for readers to determine exactly what is being reviewed: the product (in this case, a TV series), its manufacturer (here, Shout!), or the vendor with whom Amazon is dealing (Crystal Choice). To clarify: (1) The first Newhart show is a classic sit-com. (2) Crystal Choice is an honest vendor that tried to make good on a sale that backfired through no fault of their own. (3) Shout! atypically, in my experiencehad quality control problems with the new set of discs I was sentthree of which were unplayable.",1504483200,3,866,4.773333333333333

3936,5,0767001311,"Don't be put off by the comments and the ratings on the DVD company that put these out and the timing relating to the final couple seasons if you were to buy these individually.  This is common and not much we consumers can do about it.  So  I am rating the show itself... in this case, all in one box, which is what they should have done in the beginning, hence the complaints who bought season by season...

Anyway, Bob is the ultimate straight-man.  He's not over the top,  phoney, or selling out his character for a laugh.  His comedy centers on his reaction to others (quirky people & situations) around him.  This show can come across slow, when compared to the hyper shows of today, where everything has to be sexual comedy on the cutting edge and inappropriate for family.  Bob is a class act and never stoops to those tactics.  That's exactly WHY I like it.  Breath of fresh air.",1495756800,5,888,4.419753086419753
3937,4,0767001311,"I didn't see much of The Bob Newhart Show when it was originally on television, so almost all of this series was new to me.  During the first season, I was only getting a rare chuckle, if that, out of the episodes, and I was wondering if I had made a mistake in purchasing the complete series.  Fortunately, seasons 2-5 were better, and I was getting chuckles and sometimes laughing out loud at the episodes.  The introduction of the character known as ""The Peeper"" was, for me, a misstep, because he was too over-the-top silly to be amusing.  Season 6 was a letdown, with more slapstick (e.g. Zorro) and fewer good jokes.",1494720000,4,622,4.526785714285714

3952,5,0767001311,"There comes a time in every show when the plots/material become more and more familiar, trite, or benign and it's the audience's relationships with the characters (and the actors) that carry the bulk of the entertainment value. It happened with more contemporary ratings juggernauts like Friends and Seinfeld, and it happened with TBNS.  The final season of this great show was often just plain absurdly silly, with the characters behaving more like _caricatures_ of their earlier selves. And yet it still produced some of the funnier lines (""Uhh...you can call me 'Tatum.'"") and situations (Emily attending a reunion as Carlin's wife) of the entire series. Because Newhart had essentially checked out of the series after Season 5 -which was supposed to be the final season- his castmates spent more time center stage. Though something of a style departure from the first 5, Season 6 ended the series on a relatively (to other series' final seasons) strong note.",1476403200,2,962,5.127388535031847
3953,4,0767001311,"I happen to like Bob Newhart even though he is pretty much the same all the time.  This series is certainly ""dated"" but it is well done and amusing. I enjoy watching an episode every day or two when I sit down with a cup of coffee.  I'm glad I purchased it and look forward to many  ours of enjoyment. A FEW WEEKS LATER....I'M BEGINNING TO BE VERY UPSET AT THE NUMBER OF EPISODES THAT CANNOT BE VIEWED BECAUSE  OF FREEZES.  THE WHOLE LAST HALF OF SEASON 4 COULD NOT BE VIEWED AND 2 OR 3 EPISODES OF AN EARLIER SEASON WERE THE SAME WAY.",1476316800,,535,4.057142857142857

So-- I'm very glad to have been able to order this finally.  An interesting thing I read-- I had wondered why they did such a sudden set change for the apartments.  I guess they thought the show had been cancelled and they took the set apart already and got rid of it-- then they were called back for one more year-- so they had to slap together a new set!  This is also why Bob isn't always physically present in every episode-- he had booked other gigs when he thought his show had been cancelled-- so they had to make due without him.  Kind of a sad way for what was a really great show to go off-- But there you have it.  (I don't think this is the strongest season of the show, btw, but if you love Bob, you're still going to love it.)",1463270400,,879,4.129411764705883

I would not buy this again and I wouldn't watch the shows over and over again.  After watching maybe two episodes twice I tried to sell the set and Amazon wouldn't let me because I don't have my account set up to have Amazon stock the items for sale.

Aside from Bob and Emily's move to a new apartment (because apparently the old one wasn't ""spacious"" enough!) and then magically having Howard move into a neighboring apartment (which is never actually explained - Howard just resumes his regular routine of barging in every day) the season continues much as before. Bob meets regularly with his clients, particularly the infamous Mr. Carlin; he and Emily socialize with Howard, Carol, Jerry and others. Although plot-wise there is little that is truly unique or surprising, the show still works. The actors' chemistry, Bob's traditional straight-man shtick against the blundering Howard or goofy Jerry, the ridiculous statements of Mr. Carlin (all delivered in deadpan) continue to amuse and entertain.",1444953600,,948,5.629370629370629

4088,4,0767001311,"I wish there were half stars available because this set is not quite good enough for 4 stars but too good for 3.
As others have said, this last season isn't as funny as previous seasons and Bob Newhart is away for many of the episodes. With that said, a mediocre episode of The Bob Newhart show is still better than most of what's on TV these days. I would give the content of this season 4 stars but, as much as I hate to say it, the quality of many of the transfers on many of these episodes only deserves a 3 and some less than that. I can handle grainy but a couple of episodes are so washed out that everything in the scene looks sepia toned and the colors are barely there.
So, I agree that this season is a must for those of us who have been waiting to complete our individual sets and appreciate Bob Newhart in any form, but the quality isn't quite up to previous seasons.",1430697600,10,880,4.092485549132948

4090,4,0767001311,"Everyone's glad the final season of this venerable classic finally came out on home video as a stand-alone release, so hurrah for  the completists!  That said, despite some fine moments, the show begins to look tired in this season. Right away, the Hartleys move -- but only to an apartment on a different floor! So nothing really is changed except the decor and some of the off-screen layout. Howard is still THERE all the time, which becomes more and more ridiculous (even the new title sequence seems to poke fun at this) and I swear he  was made dumber and dumber as the series went on, resulting by season six  in a Howard Borden man-child personna  who is no longer a believable adult character (this man is a navigator for an airline?!?).  The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes. Was it a sarcastic message to viewers,  how often the token Bob Newhart scene in a host of episodes is him on the phone in an airport or hotel, checking in with Emily?  Three minutes of Bob doesn't even allow for a decent ""Hi, Bob"" drinking game!

Even the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.  Season Six is not the place to begin for newbies, but once you've watched this far, you might as well collect 'em all.",1430611200,4,1619,4.484641638225256

To be honest, Season 6 is less funny than its predecessors, but still worth watching. Bob Newhart literally ""phoned it in"" for several episodes (due to other filming commitments) but his phone routines are always top notch anyway.

Those of us who waited YEARS for Seasons 5 and 6 to be released can thank Shout! Factory for taking over the series. They did a good job with the packaging and the film and sound reproduction is very good for a 1970s transfer.

It's a pity that The Bob Newhart Show isn't better known by the younger generation.  It broke a lot of new ground in putting off beat comedy and characters on TV.  This collection presents the series in appropriate fashion with commentary by many of the cast and director/producers.

The Bob Newhart Show is one of those ""must have"" comedy classics.  I can't help but laugh at Bob's subtle, uptight, quirky humor, paired with Emily's playful goofiness.  A great tv marriage!  Then, when you add in the stellar grouping of zany friends and neurotic patients, it makes for hilarious episodes that we will never forget.

4197,3,0767001311,"If you have the 20th Century Fox double-sided DVD's from years ago, keep them and DO NOT buy this set as a replacement for seaasons 1-4. Another reviewer has suggested that the new Shout seasons 1-4 have ""video quality beyond superior to those awful two-sided discs"". They DO NOT! I have both sets (bought this set on that reviewer's comments) and compared several episodes from each season 1-4 on a side-by-side basis. They are IDENTICAL in video quality.

In fact, of great disappointment are Shout's seasons 5 and 6, which are noticeably poorer in video quality as compared to seasons 1-4. It looks as though Shout simply took the 20th Century Fox two-sided DVD's and duplicated them while slapping some old VHS recordings of seasons 5 and 6 onto their new DVD's. Shout, clearly, does not want to spend any money doing digital remastering. Additionally, this new Shout version has no subtitles in any of the seasons, unlike the original 20th Century Fox release.

Still, it's better than not having seasons 5 and 6, so I gave Shout 3 stars for releasing seasons 5 and 6, but Shout is not the high quality organization claimed to be. The seasons 5 and 6 are being released separately. Buy them instead of duplicating your seasons 1-4 with this complete series offering.

So I am just keeping them. The problem was I had been taping (DVR) season 6 on We TV, and thank God I saved myself the trouble of dubbing them all. But the irony is Season Five was the best...by far...no question. They jumped the shark by season 6, even though there were some good episodes. Haven't seen what's on the bonus DVD...that could make the $100 I spent for this worth it, not to mention the $200 I spent on the other four. Pretty low budget graphics for the box. Yeah, my 2nd favorite American sitcom. But at LEAST it's out. Even if they say the DVD is dead, well I'm not far behind so who cares? Gotta have season 5. Been watching it, up to 6 episodes so far. When this show was good, nothing was better. I know in six months I can get a VG copy for $40, but hey...been waiting a LONG time for this and I don't regret the money I spent.

4268,5,0767001311,"After recently seeing a Bob Newhart performance at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, in which Bob received two separate standing ovations, I decided to finally buy the complete series box set of ""The Bob Newhart Show.""  Therefore, I have no problems with the earlier releases of the first four seasons of the show.  In addition, although the video quality isn't of high-definition quality, the episodes are eminently watchable.  All problematic issues were soon forgotten after I started watching the show.  Bob Newhart was one of the first successful stand-up comedians to star in a TV sitcom.  That started a trend that continued with Tim Allen, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, and many others.  In addition, the show was not cancelled by CBS because of poor ratings.  After six successful seasons, Bob decided that is was time to end the series.  The writing on the show perfectly suited Bob's personality and comedic style.  The casting choices were uniformly excellent, especially with Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily.  Special mention must be made of Jack Riley as Bob's patient Elliot Carlin, who appeared in 56 of the 142 episodes.  To say that he is an unforgettable character is an understatement.  The box set also includes an informative booklet, which gives a brief synopsis of each episode, along with its original airdate.

What really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes ""Group Therapy,"" which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It's a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.  Fortunately, the TV show's comedy is timeless, and has held up very well over the years.",1407715200,9,2720,4.920879120879121

And it's not bad at all actually. This is one of my favorite 70's series. No. The quality is not consistent but I found that most of the discs were just fine. Some later season episodes were a little washed out in the color department but these were in the minority. Just to have the entire series finally is a dream come true. I got a brand new set for $60. which I thought was a pretty good deal. I was one of the ones who had purchased the previous sets but am really not upset about purchasing them again. It's been a long time and that money was spent many years ago. You can sell them here or on E-bay if you want to re-coup some of your money.

I've always liked Shout! Factory; I've considered them the Rhino for the new millennium in terms of putting out product that really delivers for fans. But this is just unacceptable. Another reviewer mentioned that he'd spoken to Shout about it and that they plan to release seasons 5 and 6 individually. But a) it may not happen, and 2) it's still not cool making us wait. How on earth do you justify a release like this? Where's the logic? Did NO ONE at Shout look at the countless reviews (and IMDB message boards, for that matter) decrying the absence of the last two seasons? I don't have the market research numbers, of course, but I imagine that a significant percentage of potential buyers for this were in my situation. The ratings and reviews here certainly bear it out. I very much want the last two seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" but I'm not about to pay this much to get four seasons I already own and, more importantly, support this misstep.

4334,1,0767001311,"I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.

1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.

2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to ""try it out"", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.

3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for ""jumping the gun"" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event.",1401408000,19,1517,4.330985915492958
4335,2,0767001311,"Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.

Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (""Bum Voyage"" and ""Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?"") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.

However, the ""Complete Series"" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.

Another difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day.",1401321600,23,2427,4.546910755148741

This is NOT the case.

The company that released seasons 1-4, abandoned the prospect of putting out the final two seasons.

Shout Factory is simply giving fans of the show, exactly what they've been waiting for. They should be receiving PRAISE for this...not condemnation, and a slew of 1 star reviews.

My set arrived today. I've watched 4 episodes, so far, and the video quality of seasons 1-4 is at least identical to the transfers of the original set. However, with the Shout! release you get an upgrade from those awful two-sided discs. In my opinion, the single-sided Shout! discs are worth making the purchase.

Also, these are the complete episodes...they are NOT the shortened syndicated versions.

This is a different distributor, so we should understand they were probably not going to ""pick right up where Fox left off"".  It's not like this is going to be a huge seller.  As much as we love the series, we are WAY in the minority here.  At best, the individual seasons would sell for $15 to $20.  So instead of paying $40 for the final two, for another $40 you get the whole series, in a matched set.  Life is too short, I'm not going to let something this insignificant keep me from viewing clean, unedited versions of my favorite series of all time.

My current set I recorded off of Nick probably 15 years ago, transferred to MPEG files about 12-13 years ago, cut and edited them with some cheesy video editor from the early 2000's, and got them down to around 750 MB so that each would fit on a CD.  My backups have also clogged up my hard drives over the years.  $79 to get rid of all this headache and have the complete series? Bargain!!!!

Thanks for the wonderful series Mr. Newhart, just a timeless classic that we love so much.  The Doctor is IN!!!

ADDED 5/27:  Got the set in today, worth the money.  I haven't compared the quality to the 4 Season set from Fox, but I did compare a couple of episodes to my mpeg versions I recorded 15 or so years ago.  The episodes are un-cut, which is great, but one other thing I noticed right off the bat is the episodes are the correct speed.  Syndication cuts episodes, but they also tend to speed them up to get more of the episode into the allotted 30 minute air time.  I was really surprised how much quicker the pace was on the old recordings, with all of the actor's voices a little higher as a result.  The new set is much more naturally-paced, more relaxed.  The video of the new set is not perfect, but it is very, very good.  I give it about 8.5 on a 1-10 scale.  It doesn't have that super clean, prisitine look of a big name series that has been fully restored from top-notch source elements.  But it is certainly cleaner than any Newhart episodes I have seen before, including the Fox videos.  The video is excellent for the most part and is consistent from episode to episode.  The audio is great, much cleaner than my recorded set which had a lot of hissing.  It is perfect for a 70's sitcom, I give the audio a 9.5 out of 10.

In any case, the purchase was well worth the $79.  Season 5 is one of my favorites, so I'm going to really enjoy the new set, and not worry about the $40 extra.  All in all..... ""Fine and Dandy""!!",1400630400,20,2559,4.229338842975206
4353,1,0767001311,"I've already purchased seasons 1 through 4 as many other people also have. Now I'm informed that I cannot buy seasons 5 and 6 separately! That means I have to spend $80 which amounts to $40 per season to get the last 2 and get stuck with the first 4 seasons again.

4354,4,0767001311,I always liked this show when it originally aired.  Bob Newhart is at his best playing a low-key everyman that quietly reacts to all the lunacy that surrounds him.  In this series he plays a psychologist which is a creative way of introducing some quirky characters for him to respond to (not that his friends and co-workers aren't quirky enough themselves).  The show ran out of steam the last couple of seasons when supposedly Newhart wanted to end the series but was talked into staying. It is still a fun show with a lot of good memories.,1400112000,4,542,4.56701030927835

ADDED: To the various dissenters (crybabies) who think they have to buy Seasons 1-4 again, Shout plans on selling Seasons 5 and 6 separately. So, be patient, and stop whining.",1398124800,9,417,4.608108108108108
4375,5,0767001311,"Looks like I'm the first reviewer to have actually received and viewed (at least in part) this set, having pre-ordered it from Shout who delivered it five weeks before the official release date.

BACKGROUND: The Bob Newhart Show is my favorite show in the history of television. I've bought every VHS and DVD release available over the years, and have been making recordings off the air for 20 years in an effort to collect (and then ""upgrade"" the quality of) all the episodes in this series. My expectations for this set are high since the show deserves the best DVD release possible. Fox released the first four seasons in 2005 and 2006, only to leave fans hanging for 8 years for the last two seasons. Luckily, Shout Factory took the opportunity to release the Bob Newhart Show the way it should have been from the beginning - as a complete series set. Yes, this means hardcore fans like me have DVDs, VHS tapes, and old DVD-R recordings that we don't need anymore. So sell the old ones or give them away. To me it's a small price to pay to get this set.

THE SHOW ITSELF: Not much to say other than what you likely already know - The Bob Newhart Show is generally regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Its rare combination of amazing writing, a top-notch cast, and a style of humor that is at once accessible and sophisticated, is a high water mark in the history of television.

PACKAGING: The set comes in a standard height box with 3 Amaray-style cases that holds 6 discs apiece. Gone are the two-sided Fox discs with cheesy cartoon-themed menus. Here, discs for Seasons 1 and 2 are in one case, seasons 3 and 4 in a second case and seasons 5 and 6 are in the third case. These are NOT stacked on a spindle and thus are easily accessible. The disc faces feature nice 1970s-inspired artwork across all discs with color variations for each case. The fourth (bonus disc) case is a standard height but slim. The menus for each disc are based on the look of Bob's office door. Everything is classy and everything matches.

AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY: The Bob Newhart Show has always had quality issues on broadcast and video release as far back as I remember, and sadly this release is no exception. Over the years I've assumed that the transfers we've seen are taken from either second-generation prints, 16mm dupes, or analog-sharpened film-to-tape transfers. Other sitcoms shot on film in this era look better. If anybody has inside information on the condition of the original or edited film elements I'd love to know the story. So generally the contrast on most episodes it too high and harsh looking, there is a lot of grain, and most episodes are pretty de-saturated and the color temperature is too magenta in my opinion. Sound is also a bit harsh and thin in most episodes. My guess is that Shout has used the best original material available, and I have certainly never seen this series look or sound better than it does in this DVD set. So it's just decent, and probably limited to being so just by the nature of the source material.

EXTRAS: Every episode I've watched so far is uncut and runs about 25 minutes. Shout appears to have carried over the commentary tracks from the Fox discs. The 40-page booklet is very nicely designed, well written by sitcom expert Vince Waldron, and organized so you can find the episode titles, plot summaries, and airdates easily. The 19th Anniversary reunion show from 1991 is a 1-hour ""clip show"" that is just okay. It's nice to see the actors again, but not much actually happens other than setting up the clips which are (by themselves) great. The ""Group Therapy"" extra is a sit-down studio conversation with cast and crew that is very entertaining and insightful and lasts most of an hour. The unaired pilot is a real treat, and is quite different from the show as we would know it later.

CONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some ""lost"" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come. The concept and execution of ""the sitcom"" just doesn't get any better than the Bob Newhart Show, specifically as it is delivered in this DVD set. Enjoy!",1397865600,198,4707,4.6650602409638555

The decision to require people like me to repurchase the first four seasons to see the rest of series is reprehensible.  It's a wonderful show - Thank you Bob Newhart, et al.

Having experienced Shout Factory's reverent approach to other classic sitcoms, I am more than happy to shell out for the complete series so I can re-watch the shows properly and have the last two seasons.  I'll just give away the badly-produced Fox ones.  The box set is a convenient way to purchase these, and I'm sure Shout Factory has reasons for its pricing (still less than $20.00 per season): the correct theme songs for the correct episodes, uncut episodes, re-mastered picture and sound quality, plenty of extras, maybe permissions for music heard by the characters.

I know that some people are disappointed in the complete set, but think about the seasons that FOX provided of this great series.

Each season disc from FOX is double-sided, providing awful audio, and sometimes poor video images. Imagine what these first four season sets will look like on single sided discs, restored, and professionally produced by ShoutFactory!

Thank you ShoutFactory! for answering the call of the consumer. I'll proudly spend my money with you!

**UPDATE 4/25/2014:
I received an advanced copy from Shout! Factory and I can tell you that each disc is single-sided and there is a significant improvement with the audio from the FOX seasons, as well as, a marked improvement with the video. Shout! Factory took extra care for this release.

For instance, several episodes from the FOX releases clipped the main title from the opening credits. Comparing the same episodes with the Shout! Factory release, the main titles are intact and all of the words are included. There are no episodes with muddled audio, either.

The Bonus Disc was out of this world. You get 50 minutes of the surviving cast talking about the show. It was recorded in December 2013, so Shout! Factory pulled out all of the stops to do this release justice. In addition, there are two more extras, including the unaired pilot episode with different characters.

In addition, there is an amazing book included that has an easy to read explanation as to how they show came about, stayed on the network, and left while it was still on top in the ratings.

Seasons 1 & 2 are in one DVD case. Seasons 3 & 4 are in a separate DVD case. Seasons 5 & 6 are in a separate DVD case. The bonus disc is also separate. All are contained, along with the book, in the big box.

Now, here is the not-so-good news regarding Season 5 Disc 1 - ""A Crime Most Foul"". It has a very noticeable sync problem. I contacted Shout! Factory to see if I was sent a defective disc and they replied that the master they had access to and used also had the sync problem. I'm not sure if Shout! Factory had access to the original broadcast master because the show was shot on film and I also don't believe CBS would have allowed it to air that way. Regardless, the master that Shout! Factory has access to is the problem, not your individual disc.

Other than that, sit back and enjoy The Bob Newhart Show the way it was intended to be enjoyed. Thank you Shout! Factory for honoring Bob Newhart with this release and for answering the many fans who have been waiting a long time for this day to come as well!",1389225600,82,2723,4.550102249488752
