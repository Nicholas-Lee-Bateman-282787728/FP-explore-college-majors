5563630,5,B00B94VJYW,"They just don't make em this good anymore. I had so long wanted this version of Dracula but it was always too expensive. Finally, a reasonably priced version with the bonus of two other wonderful Hammer Classics make this set a must for those who love REAL horror and not the overly gory, nonsensical, sex, nudity, and Gore and more Gore to no purpose drivel that over saturates the market today. Kudos for a good transfer to Dvd as well.",1366761600,3,438,4.4875
5563631,5,B00B94VJYW,"Been trying for Dracula, Prince of Darkness for long time.  TOO expensive, and i do NOT know WHY.  Finally, even if on a 3-some.  Good movie.  7 Golden Vampires more kung fooish, and not so great, and Frankenstein Created Woman, seen before.  Is OK.  Always like Peter Cushing.  But for me, Prince was best as expected.  5 Stars are for Prince, 1 for 7 Golden, and 3 for Woman.  Seen better w/Cushing.  However, all in all, fora the price, this is a Terrific bargain!  Got as gift, but had to see all first (ha).

5563632,5,B00B94VJYW,"Under a ""Hammer"" imprint, this DVD delivers one CLASSIC Christopher Lee Dracula film, along with one noble (but failed) experiment (""Frankenstein Created Woman""), and an oddity that was released after Hammer's peak (""Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires,"" with John Forbes-Robertson (voice dubbed) in a role that had come to be associated with Lee). The real reason to purchase this one is ""Dracula Prince Of Darkness."" ""Dracula"" is on a single disc while the other films occupy a second two-sided disc.

The second in Hammer's Lee Dracula series, ""Prince"" opens with the closing shots of Dracula's destruction in the first film. We then meet a traveling party that, unknowingly, is on the worst trip of their lives. All of the Hammer classic elements are here, including their answer to Universal's ""angry villagers"" (the angry pub dwellers who go from friendly to agitated when learning that their visitors want to cross Dracula's stomping grounds).

You have a priest intent on destroying Dracula, and a unique element in this film...Dracula's servant, Klove (Philip Latham), whose sole purpose is to wait like a spider in the web for the unknowing victims that will allow him to bring his master back to life. Klove's wait is over. It is a particularly sardonic moment when Klove, ladling up bowls of soup for the travelers, tells them that his dead master told him to always keep the castle prepared and ready for ""guests.""

Much of the action takes place in, and around, Dracula's castle. It is basically the flypaper that traps and holds the travelers. Lee is especially brutal in this film, with many closeups of his blood-red eyes. I'm not going to offer spoilers here, but the erotic heat registers exceptionally high on this one, too. Look for the scene where he runs his fingernail down his exposed chest and you'll see what I mean.

The next film, ""Dracula Has Risen from the Grave,"" was the one where everything came together to perfection: atmosphere, acting, story line, better production values and the truly amazing and mesmerizing Veronica Carlson, perhaps the DEFINITIVE ""Hammer Girl."" But it was ""Horror of Dracula"" and this film that got them to that point. It's a strange, menacing little movie (especially in the scene where Klove ""reanimates"" what's left of Dracula, which is basically a ring and dust).

At least once a year I do a ""Hammer Festival"" in which I dust off all of these classics and watch them in order. ""Prince"" is always a highlight. It is one of the single greatest and most effective horror movies ever made. For some reason it shows up on DVD, disappears, and then returns. Don't wait for the next ""downtime."" This is an AMAZING price, and the print is pristine. It is an essential film for any serious (or even casual) horror fan. The other two films are a bonus...amusing, yes, but not on par with the Dracula film.

Hopefully the ""Hammer"" imprint on this DVD is a sign of more multi-film, high-quality, budget releases to come.",1366416000,5,2969,4.869306930693069
5563633,5,B00B94VJYW,"The copy of ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" in this set from ""Millennium"" is more than worth the price. No need to pay $300.00 and $400.00 any longer.

Fans will find the aspect ratio on this new release is correct as opposed to the Anchor Bay product where the wheels on the coaches are elliptical rather than round. The scenes are now brighter and the colors more vibrant. Even the sound is better.

This collection is an odd mix of Hammer works with ""The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires"" being the worst Hammer film I think I have ever seen.  Put all of that aside however and get this set for the superb version of Prince of Darkness if for no other reason.",1365984000,2,663,4.373983739837398
5563634,5,B00B94VJYW,"One of the last Hammer movies I added to my collection and this had two previous movies I had on VHS went first released but for some
reason I never got Prince of Darkness. Wow was I shocked how good it is and as good as the first one Horror of Dracula but without
Peter Cushing but that doesn't stop it from being one of the best Dracula and Hammer movies made. The story is one of the best and
the directing and sets and acting by these well known great actors just make it a classic. Lee is pure EVIL even though Lugosi will always
be my favorite Dracula he was more scary but likeable! Lee is not. This is a must have for Hammer and Dracula fans. The other two movies
I have watched over and over on VHS and they look a little better on DVD. 7 Golden Vampires isn't typical vampire movie but that's what
makes it so good and it pretty violent with all the kung fu fighting. Frankenstein Created Women is also excellent even though not one of
the best Frankenstein movies it's a good Hammer movie and Cushing is great in both of these! Too bad it wasn't in Prince of Darkness.",1365206400,3,1079,4.167464114832536
5563635,3,B00B94VJYW,"In early March 2013 Millenium Entertainment announced a distribution deal of Exclusive Media's library of Hammer Films - including special edition blu-rays as part of a multi-tiered marketing approach.  While the UK have been getting Hammer blu-rays on a steady basis (albeit generally medicore to poor releases) here in America the pickings have been pretty slim.  It's barely a month later and Millenium has already released a quickie barebones 3-film DVD set ""at an affordable price to encourage the general public to join the Hammer fanbase"" according to their press release.  Sales figures of this DVD set are likely to be a gauge for future blu-rays.  After considering the pre-order of a measly 8 bucks, the weight it may have on future releases, and the fact I still don't own Dracula: Prince of Darkness then this DVD set was a no-brainer.  For the sake of this review I'll be referring to the LONG out print Anchor Bay DVDs, which haven't been distributed in over a decade and now command some pretty outrageous prices.

Unfortunately, being an apparent rushjob, this first release from Millenium has some drawbacks.  The first thing that strikes me is the case insert - it's so plain and unattractive, clearly a 15 minute Photoshop job.  Granted, this bears nothing on disc content but it helps illustrate the expedited manner this set was created.  The arrangement is a bit awkward in that Dracula: POD has it's own single-sided disc and the other 2 films are on a double-sided ""flipper"" disc.  There are no extras, not even trailers, so that is something the Anchor Bay DVDs have over this.  All 3 films do feature English SDH subtitles though.

DRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS - The transfer on this film is quite solid with natural skin tones, a stable image, and minimal imperfections.  The audio is very consistent and adequate.  I do not own the Anchor Bay version to compare.  As far as the film itself goes, I think this one is a little overrated.  It's still a good movie but there are other Hammer Dracula installments that I simply enjoy more (namely the 2 that followed it: Dracula Has Risen From the Grave and Taste the Blood of Dracula).

LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES - By far, the worst of the 3 transfers in the set.  Immediately upon viewing it is obvious the film speed is off, which results in unnaturally fast motion.  The runtime here is only 85 min. instead of the 89 min. length on the Anchor Bay DVD.  The increased film speed acccounts for the difference and it doesn't appear as if anything is cut.  However this one is in Anamorphic Widescreen and the AB release is letterboxed, which isn't' very friendly with most widescreen TVs.  Surprisingly this soundtrack is much clearer and more robust than AB's which is muffled lo-fi by comparison.  Also, Millenium's color palette seems more natural than the Anchor Bay transfer.  Unfortunately none of these improvements overcome the terribly distracting off-kilter film speed that renders the movie almost unwatchable.  Anchor Bay wins hands down on this one, and their DVD includes the American cut of the film as well (The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula).  I hope they straighten out the speed issue for any further release of this interesting east-meets-west flick.

FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN - Another clean solid transfer with more natural color and even a little sharper than it's AB counterpart, although the print is a little darker overall.  Audio once again is pretty tight with little to no hiss, pops, or crackles.  This movie is one of the best in the Frankenstein series and definitely one of the more inventive ones.  It's nice to see it in great condition here.  Between the good technical aspects and artistic quality FCW is the most enjoyable in this set to watch.

All in all, this isn't a bad set.  But having zero extras, minimal effort, and 7 Golden Vampires being a wash (which really needed an improved release) is enough to take off 2 stars.  If you already have the Anchor Bay DVDs, then this set won't do much for you.  But if you're looking for any of these films the pricetag alone makes it worthwhile.  Hopefully Millenium will get around to releasing blu-rays sooner rather than later.",1364947200,52,4198,4.822377622377623
5563636,4,B00B94VJYW,"Here is the lowdown on the three movie Hammer set. I watched Dracula Prince of Darkness and it is the best I have ever seen the movie look. Gorgeous color and sharp picture. I am very impressed by this transfer. I spot checked the other two films and Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires appears to be taken from the same source that the  Warner UK DVD is taken from, which is quite good. Frankenstein Created Woman opens with the Fox logo and has a Color by DeLuxe credit. The UK DVD of this title has far more vibrant color than this one does but at least this is anamorphic and somewhat sharper looking than the old Anchor Bay disc. Rating the quality of the transfers I would give Dracula Prince of Darkness five stars, Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires four stars, and Frankenstein Created Woman three stars.",1364947200,25,810,4.436241610738255
5563637,5,B00B94VJYW,Anyone who gives this set of Hammer Horror movies a low-grade is either not a fan or is just being petty. Millenium Entertainment is offering up 3 formerly out-of-print classics that were selling for well over $20 each for a used copy - all 3 for under 10 bucks!! Two sure-fire classics (Dracula Prince Of Darkness & Frankenstein Created Woman) are paired with one weird latter day Hammer entry (Seven Golden Vampires - more of a Kung Fu Movie with a Vampire backplot). This is supposedly just the tip of the iceberg as Millenium plans to release many more Hammer titles in new remastered prints on DVD & Bluray!,1362960000,68,612,4.623853211009174

5563657,3,B00B94VJYW,"Everyone who buys this is doing it for ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness.""  Sadly, this is the only one of the 3 movies in the set which is screwed up.  More specifically, the yellows and greens are out of control throughout the first half of the film.  When the distraught mother talks to the priest in the woods during the opening scene, her face is green.  The walls of the inn, as well as of the castle, are bright yellow-green.  So are the four traveler's faces in most shots.  Even the dirt road outside the woodcutter's hut is bright yellow-green.  Yellow-green is a hideous color under the best of circumstances and you won't enjoy seeing it drenching every shot.

The color and clarity on ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" are excellent, even though taken from an obviously clean but vintage print.  The awful Kung-Fu Drac film has gorgeous color but of course the film is atrocious.  Hope this helps someone.",1442361600,2,908,4.726114649681529

Also, other great Hammer classics (such as ""Demons of the Mind"" and ""The Vengeance of She"") are now hard to find at good prices, so why not release collector's editions sets of those instead of these? I'm grateful, but it's very disappointing in a way. There should at least be a way to please us nerds without distributors having to lose money on the offerings.

I've always had a soft spot for Dracula and the Seven Golden Vampires with some interesting different takes transposed from the martial arts movies; the slow-mo up-and-down jugging ghouls/zombies always appealed to me as somewhat different.  The poresence of Peter Cushing lends itself well as Van Helsing, assisted by his son and a beauitful, moneyed adventuress (Julie Ege).  The plot has Van Helsing asked by a family of Chinese siblings to help root out seven Chinese vampires from their remote village.  They are led, he eventually learns, by Dracula himself, a part turned down by Christopher Lee who was becoming increasingly restless with the quality.  Frankenstein Created Woman is a variation o the possessed innocent plot.  The Christopher Lee Dracula film in the collection is that frranchise in its prime.",1386028800,,970,5.3907284768211925

Lee is menacing as ever, with Barbara Shelley in a fantastic role as a shrewish English wife who become the first thrall of Dracula.  Frankenstein Created Woman is another wonderful entry into Hammer's Frankenstein series where the Baron (as played by Peter Cushing) places the brain of a wrongly accused murderer into a woman's body.  Those who truly committed the crime have been targeted for death by the vengeful creature.

I really could care less for blu ray and don't say the picture looks blah blah blah, I DON'T CARE ABOUT BLU RAY I never saw a difference depending on a film. So any way we get Dracula Prince of Darkness (1966), Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), and Frankenstein Created Woman (1967).

I'll review each film and give you all of the details. Here we go.

Dracula Prince of Darkness (1966):

Story: Klove a servant to Dracula kills a tourist who with 3 other tourists got dumped near the castle by their fear stricken coach driver. Klove takes the tourist's body and spills the blood on Dracula's Ashes, Dracula now has risen from the grave. Dracula begins is nightly feeding and in the end is thwarted.

Fun Facts: This film takes place where Horror of Dracula left off. Peter Cushing does not return nor does Van Helsing. Dracula never speaks, supposedly Lee didn't like the dialogue so he wouldn't speak it but the screen writer said he never wrote any dialogue so take your pick. The film was made back to back with Rasputin the Mad  Monk. The film was released in some markets on a double feature with The Plague of the Zombies. Plastic vampire fangs and cardboard ""zombie eyes"" glasses were distributed to audience patrons as a gimmick. 1966 was a busy year for Hammer as they also released 1 million Years B.C. (effects by Ray Harryhausen) and the unusual but awesome The Reptile.

Rating: 5/5 stars

Frankenstein Created Woman (1967):

Story: Dr. Frankenstein is up to no good but also doing some good as he is now transporting the souls of one person to another. 3 bastards beat a man to death and Victor's assistant Hans is convicted of the murder a murder he did not commit. This is not the Hans from Revenge of Frankenstein. Hans is sentenced to death and heart broken by Hans' death Christina (Hans' lover) kills herself. Now both dead Victor transports Hans' soul into Christina's corpse. Hans avenges his beloved and himself by killing the 3 boys that committed the murder earlier.

Fun Facts: This is the 4th entry in Hammer's Frankenstein franchise. Peter Cushing returns as Victor Frankenstein. Cushing would not play the doctor in Horror of Frankenstein (1970) but went onto play the doctor in Hammer's Frankenstein must Be Destroyed (1969) and Frankenstein & the Monster from Hell (1974).

Rating: 4.5/5 stars, I liked the new story rather than just another Frankenstein film of Victor sewing limbs and parts together.

Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974):

Story: Dracula has moved to China by taking over a Monk's body. Soon Van Helsing heads their to with help from others and it's vampires and kung fu. There's a lot of fighting and vampire blood sucking and even a little nudity. Dracula doesn't show up again until the end.

Fun Facts: Cushing returns as Van Helsing. Dracula is not played by Christopher Lee. In Chinese folklore vampires tend to hop so if you look into the background you will see vampires hopping. At the time kung fu movies were in style so to keep up with the trend Hammer teamed up with Shaw Brothers studios to make this movie. Many Hammer fans tend to dislike this film.

Rating: 3/5 stars, I don't get what you'd expect it's martial arts and vampires. The film isn't very serious in tone and all around is goofy and is non horroresque as it should be the film is loaded with action. Overall I'd say just relax tune off your brain and just have fun with it. The film is cheesy but very fun. I am a huge Hammer horror fan and yes this is not one of Hammer's bests but certainly isn't the worst.

DVD content: Main features only.

All in all the DVD gets  5/5 stars. Now we need re-releases of The Abominable Snowman (1957), Plague of Zombies (1966), The Reptile (1966), The Mummy's Shroud, Devil Rides Out, Rasputin, and a lot more. Some may disagree with my opinion on these films which is okay, but if you give me down votes just because our opinions differ then please don't because that's childish. My review was mostly meant to be informative which I hope it was. All I want to say now is halleluiah.",1375488000,3,4350,4.542199488491049

5563724,4,B00B94VJYW,"Dracula Prince of Darkness is well worth the price of this collection on it's own.  The other two are a real bonus to the deal.  Dracula Prince of Darkness looks better than it has since the time it was shown in theaters.  I have seen the film several times on television, and the colors were dark and it was hard to really see all that was happening in the scenes.  This DVD has the proper screen aspect and the scenes are alive with color and you can feel the films Gothic atmosphere.  I am very happy to see this film the way that it was intended to be viewed.  The other two films are also interesting inclusions.  Frankenstein Created Woman has a metaphysical theme that is unique in the horror genre.  Peter Cushing's Frankenstein is more benign that his usual evil self but no less driven.  Susan Denberg, who was a Playboy playmate of the month around the time of this film does a great turn first as hunched back young girl then as a beautiful but tormented woman ""created"" by our dear doctor whose purloined sole seeks out bloody revenge.  The last film is an entertaining mess.  Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires combines a Hammer Dracula film with a Hong Kong mid-seventies Kung Fu film with some zombies and female nudity and a Western quest thrown in for the hell of it.  It is a exploding pinata of ""B"" movie genres--but it is a lot of film.",1373673600,,1354,4.393574297188755

""Dracula: Prince of Darkness"" is the best of the three and comes on it's own disc. Christopher Lee was perfect as the count.
""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" are on a two sided disc with each movie getting it's own side.
Legend is a strange movie in that it's as others have commented more of a Kung Fu movie. I didn't get into this one much. It just seems weird to have a movie about Satan - a Christian creation - set in China.
Frankenstein is enjoyable with Peter Cushing as the doctor who discovers the ability to take the soul from the recently deceased and put it in another body. Okay, it is a bit of a strange premise, but carried out in true Hammer fashion.",1370563200,2,974,4.241935483870968

Now, where Seven Golden Vampires fits in with the Lee and Cushing classics is anyone's guess, but it's still a very enjoyable addition that might find receptive new audiences for it being frankly like no other vampire film out there. Prince of Darkness is marvelously shot (by Michael Reed, who also photographed On Her Majesty's Secret Service 3 yrs later) and makes use of its widescreen frames, though Sir Christopher's lack of dialogue is an odd distraction. Frankenstein Created Woman is regarded widely as one of the best of the cycle and of that period of Hammer's horror line. Wonderfully acted, written, shot, and directed, it looks better with each passing year. The biggest disappointment in this triple feature is the absence of any special features - trailers, photo galleries, anything. For the price, it's still a bargain, but such features are pretty much standard fare for buyers of older films, and it isn't too much to ask for a few of these bones to be included in the next Hammer Triple Bill - which we can all hope will be coming soon!",1369872000,4,1261,4.736363636363636

Reason is simple -- the Anchor Bay set for Dracula, Prince of Darkness was letterboxed, which means that it is basically full screen with black bars hard coded on the top and bottom, which means on a modern HD widescreen TV there are black bars on all four sides.  The new release here is true anamorphic widescreen which means that the DVD expands to fill as much of the widescreen TV as possible (still bars on top and bottom as the aspect ratio is wider than the TV, but at least it fills to the left and right edges).  For $7 it's worth the double dip even if you have the older DVDs just because of that.

5563741,4,B00B94VJYW,"Like millions of others, I'm always looking forward to another HAMMER Films DVD Multi-Pack release.  In this particular collection, I found a sequel to the DRACULA Franchise, the 4th installment to the Peter Cushing/Frankenstein Collection and an unusual collaboration between HAMMER & THE SHAW BROTHERS!  Let me elaborate on each:

DRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS (1966) was Christopher Lee's 2nd turn as Bram Stoker's famous vampire.  [While BRIDES OF DRACULA had been released in the early 60s, David Peel portrayed Baron Meinster (one of Dracula's earlier victims). The only reference to HORROR OF DRACULA was in the form of Peter Cushing's portrayal of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. So DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS is the true sequel to the original film].  The time is 10 years later and many of the young women in the village are turning up dead!  Enter 2 brothers and their wives who decide to spend the night in Castle Dracula.  Without spoiling the plot, let's just say that they made a bad choice.  In typical Hammer fashion, the movie is atmospheric and moves at a moderate pace.  Not a word of dialogue is uttered by Christopher Lee.  But it's nice to watch Barbara Shelley totally 'lose it!'  Nice color and restoration...and a perfect set-up to ""DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE""

FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN was the 4th installment in the Peter Cushing as Baron Frankenstein series.  It was better than its predecessor (EVIL OF FRANKENSTEIN) because it didn't have the 'let's revise the monster and see what happens' scenario.  Its an exploration of what happens when the soul and the body are separated...along with the familiar: ""Like Father/Like Son"" credo.  The interplay between Cushing and Thorley Walters (the local village doctor) is very good. Thorley usually portrays eccentric villagers or lunatics.  I was a little disappointed in the ending, but aside from that, I enjoyed this 90 minute film.

Wish I could say the same about THE LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES.  Granted it was a collaboration between HAMMER FILMS & THE SHAW BROTHERS, but the ""Kung Fu Vampire fights"" got stale very quickly.  Peter Cushing reprises his Van Helsing role as he teaches a course on Vampirism.  He also has a son (Robin Stewart) by his side to search for 'The 7 Golden Vampires!'  Meanwhile the 'soul' of the original Count Dracula (John Forbes Robertson) enters the body of a vampire wanna-be.  So the only time you see Dracula is at the beginning and end of the movie. Director Roy Ward Baker probably had to walk a fine line between the amount of martial arts maneuvers and vampire bites.  The Phillip Martel musical score was straight out of the original Hammer Dracula Films, but the masks the Golden Vampires had to wear were very, very funny.  Maybe this is the reason the Hammer/Dracula Franchise ended with this film?

And that's the reason I give this entire package 4 stars!",1368316800,2,2885,4.911157024793388
5563742,5,B00B94VJYW,"I bought this set for Dracula Prince of Darkness and it looks great! True there could have been more in the way of extra material, but if you look at this as being more of a ""sampler"" for the future films to come From Hammer/Millenium i think you will like this set! And, Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires looks fine to me and doesn't look speeded up at all? Maybe they have repressed the disc and corrected the problem? Bottom line if you don't mind the lack of extras and want a nice looking version of Dracula Prince Of Darkness, this set is well worth getting!",1368316800,3,562,4.261682242990654
5563743,5,B00B94VJYW,"I give this set 5 stars. Not because it's oscar worthy or anything,but,because the first film is a classic-all -the-way-Dracula- with -Christopher Lee-film and the other 2 are amusing in their undeadness variety.
First more commentary on the Prince of Darkness. This is everything a classic horror film should be: innocent people warned (but not heeding the warnings) about a mysterious castle and the danger they would be in,lulled into a sense of security,then extreme shock and horror,the escape,more horror,then the triumphant end. Classic Christopher Lee at his Dracula best!
Okay,moving on to the 2nd movie...What were they thinking???? It's like a dracula film mated with a kung fu film and this is the resulting disaster...no further comment on that one!(okay,it's interesting in its badness).
In the final film you have Peter Cushing classically portraying Dr. Frankenstein,this time weirdly possessing a girl with her dead boyfriend's soul. I'm ashamed to admit to anyone I know that I actually liked this film. The set is worth the price just for the wide variety. A great way to spend a rainy day.",1368144000,2,1109,5.166666666666667

5563745,5,B00B94VJYW,"I strongly recommend this set because of the price and getting three movies. Two of the three are awesome and classics. The weak link of the set being The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires. I didn't like that one. I got this set for Dracula Prince of Darkness alone because I heard it was very awesome follow up to Horror of Dracula. It was great but the sleeper hit of the set was Frankenstein Created Woman. I didn't expect to like that one as much as Dracula Prince of Darkness. Peter Cushing gave a solid performance in Frankenstein but the supporting actors were great in that movie. Susan Denberg played a poor girl who was crippled and had the left side of her face heavily burned. Robert Morris plays her lover and assistant to Doctor. Frankenstein. Morris did a great job. Denberg and Morris had a great chemistry and they are two characters we care about. I found this Frankenstein to better than The Curse of Frankenstein which had Christopher Lee in it. Peter Blythe was great in Frankenstein Created Woman he was very evil and definitely played the part to a tee. Thorley Walters did a great as a doctor assisting Doctor Frankenstein who is a little brainwashed by Frankenstein but he has a good heart. I was not disappointed with the ending of the movie but the beginning was my favorite part.
  Dracula Prince of Darkness was great as expected. It was a little slow and takes time before Christopher Lee appears. I thought this movie would suffer from the absence of Peter Cushing. Andrew Keir stepped in and filled the shoes nicely as Father Sandor. Barbara Shelley was great. I liked Suzan Farmer's performance as well. For me Farmer and Keir were tied for best performance second to Lee. The movie was very suspenseful. It had an awesome ending. In the second act it gets very exciting and I was anxious to see how the movie would end and was unsure of how it would end. I didn't find the movie predictable. It's great for a horror movie fan and those getting introduced to Lee's series of Dracula movies. Cheers!",1367712000,6,2033,4.582417582417582

5563747,5,B00B94VJYW,"It really doesn;t get much better than this.

Especially the little known and incredibly fun ""Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires"". A one of a kind joint studio venture between Hammer and Shaw Brothers.

The mix of old school horror (with Peter Cushing reprising his legendary Van Helsing) and early 70's kung fu mayhem is a joy to watch.",1367366400,2,334,4.6440677966101696
5563748,3,B00B94VJYW,"Considering the low price of this Milenium release, you may not mind that ""The 7 Golden Vampires"" is time compressed. I couldn't watch it. Both ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" and ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" have crisper images than their previous releases but the color is pale on the latter title. But if Dracula is the one you want, this is the best copy to date.",1366848000,12,365,4.71875
