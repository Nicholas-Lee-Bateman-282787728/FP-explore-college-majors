893645,5,630451493X,"Through brilliant editing and insightful story telling by George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, the story paints Ali as a true modern day hero in the classical definition.  After viewing the film I place Ali with the likes of  David (of David and Goliath fame), King Arthur, Luke Skywalker, and all  from Rocky Balboa to the Native American boy who leaves the village and  sets out into the dark forest alone.

893646,5,630451493X,"more than just a man, more than just a boxer, Muhammad Ali was a gift to the world.  And this documentary is a fitting tribute to the man we all know as the greatest. So few docs have the staying power to be viewed again  and again, but this...... You know what is going to happen, you know he  wins, you know he is reveared as a god, but still you are gripped to the  edge of your seat, not wanting to leave the screen for a second, affriad to  blink as you are watching one of the 20th century's most defining moments.  Whether you are black, white, catholic, muslim or whatever this is a tomb  to an event that changed all our lives.  If the unthinkable had happened  and Ali had lost, just think how much worse off we would all be for having  been denied the right to witness the Greatest at his Greatest.",945907200,2,809,4.128205128205129

WHEN  WE WERE KINGS is a must see, no, must buy, for anyone who is interested in  sports, music, race, and of course, one of the greatest heroes of our time,  Muhammad Ali.",923616000,,530,4.313131313131313

The two famous writers  were close enough (front row!) to the event but with no stake in the  outcome, and their objective comments stand out.  If you like WHEN WE WERE  KINGS, look for a video entitled CHAMPIONS (or something like that), a  group interview with Ali, Foreman, Joe Frazier and other prominent  1960s-70s heavyweight boxers.  That video offers even more old clips and  its storytelling is from the athletes' own memories, George Foreman's  thoughts most compelling.",923529600,2,674,5.333333333333333

893718,5,630451493X,"Truly an excellent documentary, this film captures the incredible boxing confrontation between Muhammad Ali and George Forman on October 30, 1974 in Zaire for the heavyweight championship of the world.  Part of what made this film great is the overwhelming odds for George to win and the courage of Ali facing seemingly impossible chances as he worked on his hand speed, endurance, poetry, and plotting his strategy.  There is little doubt Ali came into the ring with a secret plan,  The film captures the shock that swept through the commentators when George went to the canvas.  The film creates a good overview of the country of Zaire and it's people.  The film reveals the great music of the event, including the heart retching song for which the movie was named.  My only regret is director Leon Gast chose to cutout portions of the fight rather than showing to whole thing.  If the whole fight were shown, it would reveal how the tide turned to Ali in the fight, showing how George tired as he flailed away against a hard to hit opponent, perhaps the greatest defensive fighter of all time.

893917,5,630451493X,"A classic documentary (copyright 1996) of the famous fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire in which the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko personally promised both fighters $5 million apiece, regardless of who won.

I had always avoided watching boxing, until a number of worthy films with boxing themes convinced me that sometimes the drama of it is worth viewing.

The dust jacket refers to this as Ali ""at the peak of his triumphant career"".  I think that is hardly true; he had already served prison time as a refusal to be inducted for the Vietnam War; the extra age and being out of competition ages 25-29 were substantial setbacks to his career.  Nevertheless he still remains the only person to have won the World Heavyweight Champion boxing award
three times: against Sonny Liston, George Foreman and the lesser Leon Spinx.

In Zaire essentially nobody but Ali himself thought that he could beat George Forman.  Ali was significantly slower than earlier in his career.  Two boxers he had fought in the past, Frazier and Norton, had each beaten Ali in the past; George Foreman had knocked them both out in round 2 in fights with them.  In 1974 Ali was already 32; Foreman was in fine shape at age 25, and is still considered the ninth most powerful puncher in all of boxing history.  Perhaps Ali himself didn't think he could win the fight,
though he would never admit that in public.  Yet he did.  As Foreman later admitted, ""He out-thought me and out-fought me...""

This is a great documentary of the fight between two great boxers, with very different styles both in the ring and overall life.  Definitely worth watching.",1415491200,6,1650,4.787985865724382

893954,2,630451493X,"When We Were Kings (Leon Gast, 1996)
[originally posted 18Jun2001]

Taylor Hackford, the director behind such interesting and absorbing fare as An Officer and a Gentleman and Dolores Claiborne, bankrolled this film and allowed Leon Gast to direct. One assumes Gast took them helm because he'd already done a documentary about B. B. King's attachment to the events in question twenty-odd years before. Big mistake.

When you're making a documentary about such a narrow topic (in this case, the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle, the Ali-Foreman fight in Kinshasa), there is one ironclad rule: only make your documentary as long as the material can sustain it. The Hughes Brothers knew this, and when they filmed American Pimp, they cut out at 74 minutes (and that may have been five minutes longer than necessary). Gast takes an even smaller slice of life and gives it a full twenty minutes more than that.

There's a lot of great footage here, but there's a lot of filler to go along with it. It helps us to know that Howard Cosell had declared Ali's career dead not long before the fight, but do we need five minutes of Cosell's speech intercut with another four minutes of Ali's response? Do we need THAT many shots of Don King's press conference? (To his credit, Gast did remove all of the footage that focused on King's hairstyle woes.)

In the end, we get an hour-long buildup to what everyone who rents this film actually wants to see: the fight. And Gast doesn't give us the whole fight, just a highlight reel. Boxing may be a crude, cruel sport, but watching the fight and listening to the commentary offered by Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, both of whom attended, it's possible to understand the intellectuals' claim that boxing is a more poetic sport than it would seem. (So long as said intellectuals don't have to get in the ring themselves, one assumes.) Foreman and Ali both glide around that ring. It's beautiful.

...and then there's another ten extraneous minutes of ""why in the world is this here?"" footage. It's almost as if Gast were creating a film that he knew would get lots of airplay on ESPN Classic, and he wanted something roughly of the length that could work with a two-hour time frame (after you add commercials in). Well, he could have done a lot better working with an hour and a half time frame.

About twenty-five minutes too long. Otherwise, wonderful. **",1393027200,2,2387,4.725961538461538

Interesting commentary from the likes of pugilist-friendly authors like Mailer and Plimpton, some really fantastic music (BB King's ""Sweet Sixteen"" and JB's ""Gonna Have A Funky Good Time"") and of course, one of the greatest boxing matches ever.

Recalls a time when The Champ was the most famous, charismatic and captivating athletes on the planet...

I have top equipment with wide screen capabililty, but could not play the disk wide screen.  I was able to play the disk in letter box, however.  The documentary itself tells the remarkable story of one of the great heros of the Twentieth Century. Having been wrongfully stripped of his title and banned from boxing during the prime of his career, Ali's task during the ""rumble in the jungle"" comeback was to take on the undefeated heavy weight champion of the world, a man who had crushed every opponent he had ever faced.  George Foreman was younger by ten years, stronger than Ali, oblivious to pain, and with a punch like the kick of a Johnston County mule.  He feared no man, especially Ali.  Ali's strategy in round one was to attack with a right lead. It worked, to the extent that he tagged Foreman repeatedly with a right lead and was quick enough to employ that strategy w/o getting counterpunched out the ring.  What most people forget is the Foreman was not hurt by Ali's powerful right hand. It just made him angry.  The rest of the film is how Ali changed strategy in mid-fight from right-lead to rope-a-dope, and knocked Foreman out for the only time in his career.  Whenever you feel old and tired and think you have lost your edge against against younger and stronger competition, watch this film.  You will be inspired to win. Like Ali, you can beat the odds.  -- Sam Boxer",1345161600,,1518,4.544117647058823

893994,5,630451493X,"No sports figure was as polarizing as Muhammad Ali in the sixties. So it's ironic that one who was so demonized on his religious beliefs and his position on the Vietnam War, which was at that time politically correct, should wind up being the most beloved national sports figure ever. No professional athlet at the height of his career has ever sacrificed as much as Ali,  let alone any entertainer period, especially when he also happened to be Black. Ali was a champion not only in the boxing ring, but also a champion who set an example for those who believed in something greater than himself, namely the human race, and he did it in a time when the price for doing so was not just losing his livelihood, but also his life.

When We Were Kings is Mr. Leon Gast's extraordinary documentary of the hype and preparations leading up to one of the greatest upsets in sports history, 1974's Rumble in the Jungle boxing contest between Ali and George Foreman, who, at that time was perceived by the pundits as virtually indestructible. In this doc we get to see Ali out of his boxing element as he was then: cocky, defiant, funny, as good as a promoter as he was a fighter. We get to hear, in his own words, why he is the greatest, that his fight against Foreman is only a microcosm of the struggles of his people in America and Africa against injustice, winning the sentiment of the Congo people hosting the event by shrewdly characterizing Foreman as a pawn of the White establishment. We see a very young Machiavellian Don King with his black hair (now white) shooting up, building up the hype, bringing in America's hottest Black musicians and entertainers like James Brown,B.B. King, The Spinners (my all-time favorite group), Bill Withers, Big Black,etc. We get to hear the music, which serves as the soundtrack to the fighter's public training camps. We get various perspectives from the most influential writers of that time like George Plimpton and Norman Mailer (and also Mr. Spike Lee), who were both also ringside and provide lots of anecdotes, often very funny,  of a lot of behind the scenes stuff, including ringside blow-by-blow descriptions of the fight itself.

This film is very entertaining and a great artifact for young people who have heard of but have no idea who Ali was, what makes him the great icon that he is, and why he is considered the greatest in and out of the Boxing ring. I can't say enough about this documentary. I've seen it maybe 3 times in the past month. It's that good. Back then, there was a lot of swagger and that's what this film is essentially about. When men, like Ali, were regarded as Kings, as larger than life, who walked among us like giants. Took me a long time to see this film and it was well worth the wait.

The fight itself is included but there is so much great footage preceding the fight along with post fight recollections. You get great insight into Ali, Foreman, Don King, and various other characters that surrounded the fighters camps. Great back stories like how Don King was able to pull this fight off and the political turmoil that was going on in Zaire at the time. There is a great irony in the fact that while this fight was promoted as a great thing for black people because it was in Africa and Don King being the first black promoter to put on a big fight but at the same time many common blacks in Zaire were displaced and brutalized in the name of security for the ""westerners"" that came in to view and/or cover the fight. Media celebrities of the day like Norman Mailer, George Plimpton are also prominently featured. Music celebrities like James Brown along with footage from a concert put on by King a day or two before the fight. So really its also a reflection of the times too.

Another thing I would add is although I think people sometimes over do it with their idealism of Ali I think anyone that wanted to make a case that Alis boxing career was some sort of spiritual journey could use this documentary as an example to make a case for that.",1288396800,,1357,4.428

894057,5,630451493X,"""When We Were Kings"" is Leon Gast and Taylor Hackford's 1996 Academy Award-winning documentary film of ""the Rumble in the Jungle"", the heavyweight title fight between defending champion George Foreman and once and future champion Muhammad Ali.

Today's viewers are apt to know George Foreman as a genial TV commerical pitchman and Muhammad Ali as a revered but sadly physically deteriorated symbol of the sixties.  In 1974, George Foreman was the undefeated heavywieght boxing champion of the world.  His size, strength, and punching had literally leveled a series of opponents.  Muhammad Ali was an aging former champion, stripped of his title for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. military against the dictates of his religion, and on the comeback trail.  Very few people gave the colorful and vocal ex-champ much of a chance in the ring against Foreman.  Some thought he might be killed.  Only Ali seemed confident in his own destiny.

Gast and Hackford follow the action in Kinshasa as the two boxers prepare for their match and as celebrities and ring personalities circle the proceedings.  At the center of the movie is the outsized personality of Ali, talking up a good fight and reaching out to the people in Zaire.  By the time the two boxers entered the ring, Ali had converted Kinshasa into a home crowd.

The fight itself featured one of the more daring ring strategies ever seen.  Ali spent much of the middle rounds of the fight in the ""rope-a-dope,"" leaning far back on the ring ropes, riding out Foreman's truly awesome punching power and waiting for his moment to strike.

This movie is an absolutely superb viewing experience for fans of the fight game as it used to be, and for fans of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman at their prime as boxers.",1195516800,4,1769,4.837209302325581

Gast's film is a thrilling ride, providing vivid testament to what made Ali so powerful and compelling both in and out of the ring. Both Norman Mailer and the late George Plimpton add incisive commentary.",1184716800,,345,4.864406779661017
894061,5,630451493X,"This was orginally going to be a documentary about the music festival that was playing at the same time as the rumble in the jungle. The footage collected dust for years as nobody had the money to convert the footage into a film. Years later it was realised that the fight was actually more important than the music festival and the film was made. A little of the music footage is left in the final film and what there is is great, in particular BB King playing some stunning blues guitar.

This is a great documentary capturing the greatest sportsman of the 20th century at the height of his fame. Ali was perhaps physically past his best, but he still had the guts and intelligence to outwit a stronger and younger opponent. As a 13 year old I watched the fight live and to this day it remains my favourite sporting moment. Harry Commentator shouting ""Oh my God he's won the title back at 32"" still rings in my ears to this day. Of course this is an American documentary so we don't get the BBC commentary.

The contemporary interviews with Norman Mailer and George Plimpton (who were both there) add great insight into the occasion and they both tell marvellous stories about Ali.
Ali is very very funny on occasions and it is a joy to see the great man before illness set in a few years later.

As bonus items on the DVD you get both the thriller in manilla (Ali v Frazier) and the rumble in the jungle (complete).

894101,5,630451493X,"If such an event as the Foreman/Ali fight occurred today, this film would probably not be such a big deal. That is because we would have pretty much round the clock cable coverage of the event courtesy ESPN. However, given that this fight occurred in 1974, this is the closest thing you are going to get to the kind of coverage you would see if that event was held today. In spite of the reversal of fortune that this fight gave to both Foreman and Ali's careers, this film really does not focus on either one of these individual fighters that much. Instead, it gives you a real feel for the excitement surrounding the fight overall, with significant commentary by George Plimpton and Norman Mailer, who were both there to cover the event.

Of course there are segments on Foreman and Ali, and at the end, after the segment on the fight itself, there is basically a tribute to Ali both through his words and then through a series of still shots showing highlights of his life and career. However, I also learned quite a bit about Don King, the guy who made the fight happen, and how this event helped him ""break out of the pack"" when it came to managing fights and fighters. However, there is no romanticizing of the man. They mention both his strong points - his incredible intellect and that he always seemed to have a quotation from Shakespeare for ever occasion - and his weaknesses, mainly that he was ""amoral in his handling of the individual fighters' careers"". These are the film's words, not mine. Interviews and footage of the fighters and their staff preparing both physically and mentally for the big ""rumble in the jungle"" are skillfully interspersed with footage of the sportswriters of the 70's marking up copy and working old-fashioned teletypes back in the age before computers were common, along with film of the inhabitants of Zaire going about their daily life often balancing huge baskets on their heads, and also shots of the live entertainment going on including some great footage of B.B. King and James Brown. Also included is a little bit of explanation as to why the people of Zaire found Ali so endearing versus George Foreman. They said they found Ali to come across as ""a real person"". Apparently the fact that Foreman was so monosyllabic most of the time did not help his image overseas.

The footage of the fight itself is very good considering it was shot in 1974. Mailer and Plimpton do a great job of explaining everything that is going on at each phase of the fight, including trying to get inside Ali's head as to what he might have been thinking as he employed first one strategy and then another against his mountain of an opponent.

The film does mention that losing to Ali threw Foreman into a two year depression, and when he emerged he reinvented himself to the point that, as Norman Mailer says in the film, ""you would be hard pressed to find someone more affable than George Foreman is today."" The postscript on Ali is interesting too. Mailer mentions that after this fight, Ali went on to fight 22 times, and all of these additional fights ruined his health. Mailer mentions that it is often said that you wind up destroying the thing you love, but in Ali's case it was the thing he loved that ultimately destroyed him, or at least his physical health.

This is a very good and complete portrait of a unique sports event and the very interesting people involved. You don't have to be a boxing fan to enjoy it. If you enjoy a good tale about the triumph of an underdog, the intersection of two very different cultures, and anecdotes about some of the more interesting sports figures of the 20th century, you'll like this film. I highly recommend it.",1171929600,,3694,4.609422492401216

I am no boxing fan (for its violence, and fight-fixing - I actually dislike the sport), but this film has got to do little about boxing itself. It is mostly about a highly energetic man who actually who was on a mission of conquering and changing the world (not just the boxing world).

It was very inspiring to see someone who actually had such a strong belief in his ability to instill change and fight for the problems of his time. Even though the events depicted are from early 70's, they hardly look out of context in the present world.

894103,5,630451493X,"Filmmaker Leon Gast attempted to do the impossible in 1974; chronicle the build-up to the highly-anticipated ""Rumble in the Jungle"" heavyweight title clash in Kinshasa, Zaire, between champion George Foreman and Muhammad Ali, the fight itself and the aftermath.

While the fight went into the boxing history as one of the most exciting and controversial ever, the project was KO'd for 22 years through a number of lawsuits involving Gast and individuals who bankrolled the project.

It was well worth the wait.

The intrigue and excitement surrounding the event is captured through the participants in and out of the ring. There were questions on whether the fight would ever take place and - if it did - whether Ali could survive the onslaught of the champ who destroyed Joe Frazier to win the crown and packed destructive power in his punches.

As a sidebar, Foreman for years claimed that a water-bottle used in his corner may have been tampered with, as he could not explain why he became so exhausted during the fight. Foreman also had numerous death threats placed against him in the weeks leading to the match.

The interviews with Norman Mailer and George Plimpton are especially interesting, since both writers were at the fight and share recollections that only those covering the chaos could relate to viewers. In his book on the fight, Mailer admits that he - like many others - was afraid that Ali was at risk getting severely hurt or killed in the ring.

The film won numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Documentary, Features. It is a classic for those who want to capture a classic moment in boxing history when a larger-than-life Ali soldified his crown as ""The Greatest of All-Time.""",1158451200,,1717,4.883161512027492

894137,5,630451493X,"If you didn't already know, `When We Were Kings' pivots around the build-up of the prolific duel between George Foreman and then-World boxing champion Muhammad Ali - astutely named Rumble in the Jungle. Shot originally in the early `70s, this documentary has over 500 different shots of Zaire, Ali's charades and training, fans, musicians, choreography, meetings, schedules, plans, anecdotes from critics and officials, tours and countless more.

The documentary's pace is superb. We see a slight build-up and anticipation of both fighters and fans. We also see the grit of Zaire, its core and people. What the documentary also does is acknowledge authoritative figures such as the president of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko and his techniques. There are also establishment shots of musicians, ranging from the iconic Blues artist B.B King to the `King of Soul' James Brown.

This is one of the few documentaries that rely on archive footage to prove a point. Every scene and pixel was shot in real-time by producer/director Leon Gast in 1974. Every shot was evidential and decisive to his artistic integrity. I like the way the tribal music overlaps some of the crucial scenes such as the conversations Don King for a gritty and murky effect. Don Gast brilliantly uses the voices of most of the trainers and critics attained in the interviews to give some of the scenes the narration it needs.

The narrative is constructed by the remarkable scenes captured. Usually, you'll never see the attitude of a fighter before the fight. Here, we see the reactions, mind-set, commitments, anticipation, regimes and wits two fighters had before embarking on one of the greatest boxing matches of the 20th Century - as well as the clever feats Don King had to go through to make his reverie promoting match-up work in Zaire.

With the help of archive footage shot 22 years before its awaited release, `When We Were Kings' manages to garner a spot in the 50 Greatest Documentaries list - according to Hollywood Reporter. With a charismatic legendary boxer, a famous promoter, a shrewd fighter, a legendary director (Spike Lee), iconic musicians, a tremendous supporting cast, a beautifully shot match along with an Oscar under its proverbial belt, `When We Were Kings' is a must see for anybody who's never even heard of the `Rumble in the Jungle'.",1147219200,,2330,5.012919896640827

It is fashionable now to denigrate Ali's accomplishments, question his undeniable stance as an inspiration to blacks and his uncompromising opposition to the Vietnam war, to magnify his dark side to absurd proportions; here, however, he leaves us with no doubt as to his greatness as a boxer and his charisma as a social figure.

This is a masterfully made documentary when one considers the subject--one boxing match with a lot riding on it.  The turbulent heat of the 1960's simmer from every scene in Zaire, it seems impossible to reconcile this livewire, Ali at 32, making everyone laugh, taunting, never missing a chance to be in front of the camera, with the all but mute Parkinson's victim we see shamble around today. You have to watch this to understand why Will Smith failed: no one can replicate the cartoonish, almost insufferably fierce and proud presence of Muhammad Ali during this time.  Stoned musicians crack jokes, both fighters take serious verbal shots at each other (if you only know Foreman as that smiling bald guy who sells grills, you'll be surprised to see a frightening, arrogant young man who drips with self-assurance and physical dominance in every scene), jazz music blares everywhere, and tension mounts.  Everyone, even those in his own training camp, have Ali pegged as failing or getting seriously hurt before he enters the ring.  Everyone but Ali.

As far as the fighting footage goes, a lot of it is interrupted by interesting but distracting commentary from the respectable George Plimpton and the scuzzy Norman Mailer, who was inspired to write a really bad book about the event entitled ""The Fight"".  Plimpton later said the two most shocking events he had ever witnessed were the assassination of Robert Kennedy and Muhammad Ali defeating George Foreman.

One has to feel bad for Foreman, as Ali steals all the thunder for himself as soon as their planes land in Africa.  The Africans immediately see him as the true Champion; he fills his press conferences with a lightning grandiosity that is impossible not to like.  Foreman is quiet and acidic.  In his mind, he had already beaten Ali.

Ali as tactician and psychological terrorist is what we get to see here.  Objectively, there were few reasons for Foreman to fear Ali; he was many years his senior, no longer had the invincibility of the former Cassius Clay, and had spent many years inactive.  Foreman, on the other hand, possessed such incredible brute force that he was knocking a hole (anyone who has ever hit a real boxing bag knows how fearsome this really is) in one Everlast heavy a day.

But somehow Ali, managed it, as Foreman looks more stunned and

fearful with every round; it is bizarre to see this monolith of a man, who then possessed the physical presence of two Tysons, standing in the ring with the look of a ten year old who has just been slapped by his father.

Ali pulled a move that could have been potentially fatal at the hands of Foreman--he simply leaned against the ropes during each round, infuriating the already angry Foreman by ridiculing him (""You hit like a girl, George"") and allowing the giant to punch him as hard as he could.  How he absorbed these blows--the ones that didn't miss--without either passing out or getting his ribs cracked is still a mystery to me.  The few times Ali gets hit full force he looks like a man who was just shot; his eyes glaze, his body takes on momentary rigidity, but then he plays it off and just keeps moving. Then, when Foreman has nothing left and has really just given up, Ali gives him two vicious right hand leads that floor him.

This moment catapulted Ali into eternity.  He had effectively done the impossible.  The Liston fights and the Thrilla In Manilla wouldn't have been enough without this victory.  I wouldn't say that Ali's boxing skills are necessarily present enough here to call it one of his best ""fighting"" moments per se, but rather it gives us a keyhole into his spirit.  He had the balls of an elephant and an amount of bravery most people can only muster in absolute emergencies, perhaps too much for his own good.  To be battered that viciously and still care about the Heavyweight Championship shows how much boxing meant to him.

Whatever anyone might say, along with Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali was the most gifted boxer of all time.  One need only watch this, or the actual tape of the entire fight, to realize this.

Foreman became a headcase after this fight, losing to Jimmy Young and fighters of a lower caliber.  He denied to himself and intimidated everyone else into denying he had lost that night; he was so devastated and dumbfounded that he wanted to live in a solipsistic world of delusion.  This changed later.  He stopped boxing for awhile and had some kind of religious vision.  This fight changed one man's entire personality and cemented the other one's reputation as the greatest boxer of all time.",1143504000,3,5669,4.708206686930091

But,in some sense,I guess ""the right guy won"",because if Ali lost,I'm not real sure the  Oscar winning,excellent documentary,'When We Were Kings' would've been produced.

The documentary was  a project  that couldn't miss-considering the cast of characters involved. The fight was held at the site of one of Zaireian dictator Mobutu's torture sites,which featured the up and coming boxing conman/promoter Don King,pompous commentary-with equally pompous accents by Norman Mailer and George Plimpton,loudmouth Ali-and an interesting,introspective George Foreman,who came into the fight billed as a young thug. But it was Foreman who objected to Ali's leading the locals in the chant,""Ali,boombaye""('Ali-kill him').

While there has been serious speculation  that the ropes were purposely loosened to help Ali lean backward and pull off  his 'rope-a-dope',everybody loses-sooner or later. Ali would later lose his title to

Leon Spinks,who had all of seven pro fights,at the time and ""win a gift decision"" over  my favorite heavyweight of the era, Jimmy Young,who would send Foreman into retirement-and then into  one of the ultimate comebacks of this or any other century.

I'm not a fighting enthusiast, but it taught me enough to appreciate what made both Foreman and Ali such skillful craftspeople.  It also highlighted the magnetic personalities of Ali, Don King, B.B.

I was thoroughly fascinated with the movie's description of the politics and problems of putting the fight on.  While some reviewers thought it would have been better if it had been completed in the aftermath of the fight, this movie is more interesting as History than it would have been as News.

For instance, nowadays we think of George Foreman as an overweight pitchman for corporations with comedic timing, but this movie makes clear that at the time of the fight he was a thoroughly dangerous man.  One look at the video of the heavy bag after his workout and you understand why he was a force in boxing for so long.

Those people who saw the fight at the time may be disappointed in this presentation, but for those of us who were too young or only follow boxing casually, this is an excellent movie to own.",1128816000,,1008,4.451086956521739
894143,5,630451493X,"For anyone who does not know the story that led up to this fight, here it is:  In 1964, the mouthy impetuous Cassius Clay (soon to become Muhammad Ali) a 10 to 1 underdog, defeats the supposedly undefeatable Sonny Liston to become heavyweight boxing champion at just 22 years old.  Clay used his unbelievable speed to pepper Liston into quitting on his stool after the 6th round.  In 1967, Ali is stripped of his title for refusing to be drafted in the Vietnam War.  Ali is reinstated in 1970 after a 3 and 1/2 year lay-off during his physical prime.  Ali, now 29 years old, must fight Joe Frazier (who is in his physical prime at 27) to regain his crown.  The two meet in Madison Square Garden in the ""Fight of the Century"", this first time two undefeated champions meet for the title.  Ali loses to Frazier in 15 grueling rounds and it appears his chance to regain the title is history.  In 1972, Ali is defeated by a relative unknown, Kenny Norton, in a 15-round decision that sees Norton break Ali's jaw.  It appears that Ali is finished.  In 1973, Frazier loses the title to the young, powerful, Sonny Liston-like slugger, George Foreman.  Foreman bounces Frazier around in the ring like a rubber ball, knocking him down 7 times before the fight is ended.  After easily KO'ing the imposing Kenny Norton in one round, Foreman is seen as undefeatable, just as Sonny Liston was in 1964.

Now it's 1974, Muhammed Ali is 32 and thought to be well past his prime by the press and boxing world.  Even his handlers feel Ali cannot beat Foreman and they fear Ali will be hurt badly by Foreman.  Foreman is ten years younger and undefeated Heavyweight champion of the world, a title he appears to own for the next decade or more.  Fight Promoter Don King offers both fighters a record 5 million dollars apiece to fight.  King finds a financial backer in Mobutu Sese Suko, the dictator of Zaire and the fight is set. Ali nick-names the fight the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" and looks forward to fighting Foreman in his ancestral ""homeland"" of Africa.

The documentary shows all the prefight shennanigans in detail, which builds to the actual fight night.  In the moments leading up to the fight, while Ali and his corner men are in the tunnel waiting to emerge to the ring, Ali senses the dour, almost funeral-like mood, and chastises his group for not believing in his ability to beat Foreman.  He leads his group forward to meet Foreman, with Ali the only one convinced that he can win.  The fight is terrific.  Ali plans to dance and move around the relatively slow and immovable Foreman, peppering him with jabs and right crosses much like he did to Liston 10 years earlier. But Ali expends so much energy trying to avoid the KO punching Foreman that he knows he cannot keep it up over 15 rounds, so he decides on the spur of the momment to lay on the ropes and let Foreman hit him in hopes of tiring Big George and later decisioning him.  Foreman, seeing Ali on the ropes right where he wants him, wades in and begins pounding on the stationary Ali. Ali proves difficult to hit even though he is not moving!  Round after exhausting round, Foreman pounds Ali to the body, and then throws haymakers to the head hoping to overwhelm Ali and knock him out.  But Ali survives the best of what George can deliver and in the 8th round he comes off the ropes and tags Foreman with a series of rights and lefts that drops George to the canvas!  A stunned Foreman is counted out by Zach Clayton the referee and ALi is once again the champion!

After the fight, Ali holds a conference where he angrily chastises the press for writing him off as a fighter.  Ali then proceeds in a monsoon rainstorm to his headquarters in the dead of night, himself stunned by the Africans who line the street in the downpour hoping for a glimpse at the new champion.

It is all very well done and is a must for any serious boxing fan.  I highly recommend it.

894144,5,630451493X,"This is a very good film about the ""Rumble in the Jungle"", the fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.  It captures the craziness and hype that went into the buildup to this clash and the highlights of the fight itself.  It is really about Ali and centers on his career from the time he became a pro.  The Ali the film paints is one who is true to himself, who stands up against the Vietnam War and who makes the comeback against a man most thought would beat him and probably should have beaten him.  But Ali prevailed and prevailed dramatically.

George Foreman is cast as the enigmatic force out the crush Ali.  He is shown destroying Joe Frazier and Ken Norton and appears to be a mountain ready to drop on the past-his-prime Ali.  The commentary of others such as Howard Cosell, Norman Mailer, Spike Lee and George Plimpton does a great job in capturing the mood and anticipation of that time and adds a great deal to the already terrific footage.

I guess contemporary interviews with the fighters would have changed the film.  George Foreman has talked about this fight and is very interesting on the way he was and what that fight ended up meaning to him.  Ali cannot speak as he once did, but when he does communicate it is meaningful.  I do enjoy the insights of the commentators, but it would have been nice to get something more from the fighters.  I also wish Joe Frazier had a bigger part in the film.  Certainly, he was one of the We who were Kings back then.

This is a film that has meaningful things to say that transcend the fight game.  It is about character, our culture, the nature of hype, and the way someone like Ali transcends the normal barriers to become a worldwide icon.

I have to agree with those reviewers who have pointed out that WWWK badly misrepresents the fight. The simple truth is that Ali won every round of the Rumble. He was right on top of Foreman from the outset, and the clever editing and dramatic spin put on the match by Norman Mailer is just so much fiction. Foreman looked like he'd swallowed some substance which was the opposite of speed: as Joe Frazier said in the live commentary, he was missing with empty air-swings and ""boxing foolish"". After two rounds, which was about as far as he'd needed to go in previous fights, he ran out of wind. He still tried to use Ali's body as a punch-bag, more and more feebly, while Ali was picking off blow after blow to Foreman's head as if it was a standing punch-ball. Ali certainly threw a head-punch with shattering speed. He rolled around on the ropes a lot of the time, but for the rest he ducked away and danced around grinning fit to bust, mocking Foreman with his mouth and winking to the crowd. He was in much better physical shape, superbly fit, and he boxed an extremely smart strategy in the local conditions. WWWK is still a great film, however, full of interesting comment on the politics and hoop-la of the event: but it's marred by its fake telling of the fight. Ali is presented in all his glorious charismatic uppity persona, a magnificent physical presence, funny and clever, the epitome of boxing skill.

And it is a truly great film.  It is a great film because it documents a great time in American and African history and because the things it documents are inherently dramatic and exciting.

It's not as ""artsy"" as Leni Riefenstahl's classic documentation of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but that event had a totally different cultural and historical context.

894202,4,630451493X,"As a piece of archival footage this film can't be beat, as it captures the chaos and pageantry that surrounded the Ali-Foreman fight in 1974.  Ali never looked so great as he did in the build up to this fight.  He was in prime form, even if a heavy underdog to the massive George Foreman.  Leon Gast captures Ali in all his crazy kinetic glory, boasting proudly of how he would dance, and Foreman wouldn't lay a glove on him.  Gast also focuses on Don King who in typical fashion played both ends of the stick, promoting both fighters and coming up with a $10 million purse thanks to Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruthless dictator, who saw a potential windfall for the country in the international attention this fight would generate.  As Ali noted, some nations go to war to get attention and this fight will cost a lot less than a war.  What we got was the famous ""Rumble in the Jungle.""
Unfortunately, this film doesn't go very deep in analyzing the fight, and gives the fight itself surprisingly short shrift. All we get are a handful of truncated rounds and the final blow delivered by Ali. But, what this film does provide is the pageant that surrounded the fight along with engaging commentary by Norman Mailler, who evocatively captured the spectacle in ""The Fight,""  George Plimpton, Thomas Hauser, who has written the definitive biography on Ali, and Spike Lee. Mailler is the most fun to listen to, as he lived and breathed the fight and gives some of the most trenchant comments on it, but he too seemed mystified at how Ali pulled it off, chalking it up to the ""trembling woman"" who supposedly sucked the life out of Foreman.
George Foreman seemed invincible, having torn apart Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, but he simply wasn't prepared to deal with someone of Ali's caliber, or the massive publicity this fight generated.  Foreman was also shocked to be so poorly received in Africa, where Ali was King.  Foreman seemed out of place in Kinshasha, never able to find his footing or able to deal with a crafty fighter like Ali, who came up with his famous ""rope-a-dope"" that evening.  Foreman simply punched himself out and had nothing left after seven rounds.  It was then that Ali worked his magic and proved to the world that he was indeed the greatest, staging one of the most astonishing comebacks in sports history.
""Ali Boom Bay Yea"" the crowd chanted as Ali fought himself off the ropes and pummeled Foreman with an array of blows that had him tumbling to the mat. Ali never had another moment like this, although he would successfully defend his title 10 times before his ignominous defeat to Leon Spinks in 1978, only to regain it for the third time that year.

The movie itself is somewhat dated as far as film making goes. Get ready to travel back to the mid '70's / early '80s.

""The Rumble in the Jungle"".

The film looks at everything in several ways, and I'm not sure if any particular audience can be completely satisfied. However, it does come together to be a very nice film.

It's not really a boxing documentary, because it has very little of the actual fight. I was disappointed in that. What it does have is a lot of Ali running his mouth (which he did so well). Being somewhat younger, I wasn't around for Ali's heyday. We always hear how great Ali was, but the Ali we see today, is the man stricken with Parkinson's. To see Ali in his finest form, was pretty cool. These weren't formal interviews or press conferences, but everyday Ali showboating for a camera. In this respect, it was a very pro-Ali film (to the victor goes the spoils I guess).
My complaints (besides lack of boxing):
It spends excessive time showing some of the clips from concerts with James Brown, B.B. King, and etc. They're great musicians, but I watched the movie to see boxing and boxing-related things, not a music video.
It spends another length of time, talking about how the fight  was tying roots of blacks back to African and such. I thought it was bit of hogwash, because the fight was in Zaire only because the dictator of Zaire paid the 10 million for the fight: no other reason.

When the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" promoters traveled to Zaire in 1974, they were entering one of the worst disaster zones in post-colonial Africa.  Fourteen years earlier, Joseph Mobutu had seized power after torturing and murdering Patrice Lumumba, the leader of the nationalist movement and Zaire's first Prime Minister.  He did so with the help of the CIA, who had fingered Lumumba as a potential troublemaker.  Mobutu's government (which lasted until his overthrow in 1997) was brutally repressive when it bothered to govern at all.  Even by the standards of African strongmen, Mobutu was a monster, and this was as clear in 1974 as it is today.  Yet almost no one in ""When We Were Kings"", either the subjects of the documentary or present-day commentators, has anything to say about it.  The fact that Mobutu was a dictator is mentioned only is passing, and is quickly shrugged off.  He was an African leader, seems to be the attitude.  They're all dictators.  What do you expect?  Then it's on to Ali's inspired riffing for the press and the inner workings of the rope-a-dope.

If Gast's film were only about boxing, its cynicism might just be bearable.  After all, no one pictures Don King losing sleep over geopolitical niceties.  But ""When We Were Kings"" also has a political agenda.  It wants to depict a heady moment in the Black Power movement when African American luminaries traveled to Africa to express solidarity for the people of that continent.  For the Americans in the movie, the trip to Africa was a profound exploration of their heritage and identity.  We see Ali moved by the experience and don't doubt that he's sincere.  It's just not clear what the Africans got out of the deal.  They seem mostly just props in the first worlders' journey of self-discovery.  In one of the movie's few interviews with an African, a man recalls how Ali's visit was a bright spot in the lives of many of his countrymen, who were generally having a hard time of it.  That's about the best ""When We Were Kings"" can do by way of justification.  Given the circumstances, this silence is galling.  Maybe Ali could have come up with a clever rhyme for ""let them eat cake.""

Of course, it's a fact that many post-colonial governments were and are dictatorships, and Africa got more than its fair share.  A certain degree of cynicism about third-world politics is realistic.  But when the subject is Africa, a whole other level of cynicism comes into play: not only do you accept injustice; you don't even have to rationalize your acceptance.  There's no way back in 1974 a left-wing Chilean-American boxer would have taken part in a title bout staged by Augusto Pinochet.  Nor would Muhammad Ali have fought in the U.S. in a match bankrolled by a black gangster with known ties to white supremacists.  So why does Mobutu's dog-and-pony show get a pass?  The culprit appears to be the need on the part of the African Americans in the movie to romanticize Africa.  (Tellingly, almost no one says the word ""Zaire."")  In one scene, Muhammad Ali stands in the cockpit of an African airliner.  He expresses amazement at the fact that blacks can fly a jet plane, then amazement at himself for having ever thought otherwise.  It's a powerful moment.  You can see how a black American-even someone as lauded as Ali-would crave an idealized image of Africa to serve as armor against the insidiousness of racism back home.  Unfortunately, idealization comes at the price of ignoring a continent's worth of reality.  In order to raise your fist, you have to close your eyes.

In his scathing criticism of ""Heart of Darkness"", the Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe accuses Joseph Conrad of a particular sort of racism.  What bothered him was the way that Conrad used an entire continent and its people as nothing more than a foil for European introspection: ""Africa as setting and backdrop which eliminates the African as human factor.""  ""When We Were Kings"" is about as far from racist as a movie can get, but it still falls into Conrad's trap.  Here the backdrop is a romantic notion of an African motherland, and the human factor is the reality of the brutally oppressive Mobutu regime.  Gast may have gone all the way to Africa to get his footage, but the mindset of his film never left home.",1046217600,6,4809,4.82518337408313

Terrifically entertaining, funny, historic, illuminating, controversial, colorful, poetic, chaotic and just out and out brilliant. Not to mention that the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" boxing match took place in a stadium built on top of a torture chamber. Yikes!
Muhammed Ali may have not been the greatest fighter of all time (Rocky Marciano would have killed him) but he was certainly the most entertaining. His press conferences were actually more amusing than his fights. He would bust out hilarious poetry on the spot: ""They was shocked when Nixon resigned, but wait till I whoop Foreman's behind."" He never knew when to shut up, whether in practice or in the hallway, or in his room, or out in the courtyard, or in the streets. Muhammed Ali was non stop kinetic energy. A motormouth who somehow backed up all his incessant taunts. His trainers sweated more than he did. His friends warned him how big Foreman's right hand was. They told him to tone down the rhetoric. The reporters hoped he would keep it up.
Foreman was a monster of a man who's punch was so powerful he actually puts a dent into a punching bag during the film!  Ali didn't care. Ali was the ""greatest fighter of all time"". You cring as you watch the Foreman pummel his sparing partner with one thunderous blow after the next. You contrast that with Ali who spends more time yapping than sparring. You think to yourself: ""Ali is gonna get killed. My hero is gonna get killed.""
You see how the entire continent of Africa is fixated with this fight. You see how Don King works his magic/chicanery. You cringe some more. You see how the African kids idolize Ali and imitate his boxing moves. You smile. You finally see the fight. You see Ali getting pummeled round after cring-inducing round. You think to yourself: ""He's dead."" You see Foreman getting tired. You suddenly see Ali emerging fresh as a daisy. He had his hands up the entire fight. He was using his rope-a-dope.  He had this whole thing worked out. You see him take over the fight. You're astonished, amazed, spellbound. You want Ali to be president of your country. You want him to marry your daughter. You once again idolize this man. Man, this is a great documentary!",1034812800,3,2275,4.685

You can do what Michael Mann did in a movie.  But it is very different with a documentary.  What this film does is show alot of scenes that will put you to sleep.  Your eyes are fixed on the opening scenes where Muhammad Ali one of the things he did best, building up the fight by calling George Foreman ""The Mummy"" and things like that.  And your eyes are fixed on the film when the Rumble in the Jungle actually starts.  But in between that, theres nothing.  I was talking about music videos in ""Ali"" in this it does just that which does make the documentary seem extremely boring.  But I also believe that this film makes it look like Ali was doing terrible.
  The film reshows the same scenes over and over again.  I think I remember seeing one scene where Ali got trapped on the corner being punched in the face by Foreman 6 times.  It makes it look like Ali didn't have a chance and at the end he just got extremely lucky.  The reshowing of the same shots over and over again can be useful if well done, it was not so in theis documentary.  If you want truly see the inginuity of Ali's strategy in this fight buy the two disc set documentary of Muhammad Ali called ""Muhammad Ali - The Whole Story.""

894272,2,630451493X,"To watch this film, you would think that Muhammad Ali spent the entire Foreman fight cowering against the ropes. That simply is not true.

For some reason, the people who made this film decided that they needed to enhance the ""David and Goliath"" aspects of the fight at the expense of the truth.

If you watch the fight, the unedited version of the fight available on HBO's ""Muhammad Ali: The Greatest Collection,"" you see a very strong Muhammad Ali who flew to Africa to win a fight, not to make some kind of world-changing statement.

In When We Were Kings, we are constantly told how all of the sports writers picked Foreman to win the fight.
Watch the actual broadcast, and you learn that most reporters changed their minds as they watched Ali and Foreman train.  They originally picked Foreman to win, but found themselves more impressed with Ali.

The highly edited--and spun--version of the fight in When We Were Kings shows clip after clip of Ali doing his ""rope-a-dope."" The movie gives the impression that Ali did little more than hang on for life from rounds 2-7.

Ali did rely on the ""rope-a-dope,"" but he also came out swinging at the end of every round.  That was Ali's motus operandi in his latter fights--to cover up for most of the round then throw flurries during the closing 30 seconds, dazzle the judges, and steal the round.

He may have done the ""rope-a-dope"" for much of the fight, but he kept an eye out for any openings, and caught Foreman off guard several times.
As far as the Greatest hanging on for dear life, Ali just did not do that.  He constantly taunted Foreman.  Hell, at one point he pinned Foreman's head under one of his arms and winked at Jim Brown--the NFL legend was one of the announcers.

When We Were Kings ignores Joe Frazier--the former champ attended the fight and sat with the commentators. According to Frazier, Foreman was fighting a ""foolish fight."" Frazier gave most rounds to Ali. Those he did not give to Ali he called ""even.""

Hell, When We Were Kings even ignores the great Muhammad Ali when he gets in the way of their version of the story. They tried to portray him as having come out of the fight humbled and philosophical. In truth, he came out stating that he never lost a round, joking and shouting.

The menacing inarticulate George Foreman of the 1970s will be a revelation to those who only know him as the cuddly HBO commentator and pitchman trying to sell us grills and mufflers.

894321,5,630451493X,"This film was well worth the long (almost twenty year) delay.  A great documentary on ""The Rumble in the Jungle"" which marked the return of Muhammad Ali to the top of the boxing world.  While this bout was not as great (according to boxing afficionados) as the epic ""Thrilla in Manila"" against Joe Frazier, it does go down as one of The Champ's greatest victories.  Few gave him a shot at beating the supposedly indestructible George Foreman (who had destroyed Frazier twice before this fight).  George Forman has had a fascinating turnabout.  Few people remember him as the smiling, gentle giant that he has transformed himself into.  Back then, he would have scared Tyson, as the rogue-ish evil and almost vicious bad man he was.  However, as a friend of mine said after this screening, a good A.W. will often do that for a man.
Don King did put on a happening, and much of it is captured in this great documentary.  The fight was preceded by a number of other events, including musicians (like James Brown, B.B. King and the Spinners), dancers and celebs.  Much of that was captured here.
Much of the dialogue was provided by dueling journalists Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, each trying to outdo one another on the import of the fight.  I agree with another reviewer, it would have been great to hear from Ferdie Pacheco and Angelo Dundee, the men in Ali's corner.
During this time, Ali was called the most recognizable man in the World.  I sure would not have bet against that.  This film captures much of the character which made him a great figure, as well as a great boxer.",1008720000,5,1586,4.625

Between Muhammad Ali's poetry (and taunts at Howard Cosell's sex life), the awesome, instantaneous, destructive power of a hungry young knight at the apex of his illustrious career--as Howard might have said-- and the one, two, three, four punch of James Brown; life really doesn't get much more exciting.
These are the obvious reasons to love this documentary. But there's also the very real political side; promoting a huge fight in a country ruled by an evil dictator; one who ""sent a message"" by rounding up a few thousand criminals, and killing them. So it's pretty damn interesting to see some drunken, coked up early 70s music promoter dealing with logistics in lovely Zaire.
I also love listening to what Foreman says, and doesn't say, as I think Norman Mailer mentions in the film. My favorite is when some silly reporter asks him if he thinks Ali will win the fight, or something like that.
""Could be, could be...But I don't think so.""
Everything in this film is worthwhile. It even explores a bit of the underbelly of the beast; the world of Don King, boxing promoter, and amoral manipulator (well, I guess the two go hand in hand). And mention is made of Muhammad's current illness, with conflicting views of whether too many beatings took him down.
It's a film about all this and more. The story of Ali is exciting enough, with enough raw courage to put Rocky Balboa to shame. Add a quiet, dispondent, monster of an opponent, the king of sleaze, The Spinners, a sucubus, the evil dictator, George Plimpton, Norman Mailer, and others; and what do you have?

894323,3,630451493X,"First let me tell you that I am a boxing and Ali and Foreman  fan and I looked forward to seeing this film. I would like to make a few points. Most of the film is overwhelmingly devoted to Ali to the near total exclusion of Foreman. Foreman -like Ali an Olympic gold medallist- was a product of the Jobcorp program set up by the Johnson administration to give vocational and educational training to post school age youths. Unlike Ali he came from a very deprived background. He was concious of the positive role American government policies had created in helping him out of a life of poverty and violence. His benign view of the American government and the need to support its policies especially in Vietnam was a view taken by many  older black figureheads such as Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis. Also Ali's political viewpoints seen to be sanitised. All of his  unpleasant statements supporting the racialist views of Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan seem to have been left on the cutting room floor.  Secondly the strongman of Zaire president Mobutu receives a comparatively mild treatment. It is indeed mentioned in passing that he executed nearly a hundred criminals in the run up to the event as a public control measure. What is not mentioned is that he also bankrpted Zaire in financing the Ali-Foreman fight and other loss making ventures and fled the country most of its remaining wealth to die in exile. We also don't get to know most of the entertaining shenanigans and backdealing that went on behind the scenes with Don King in staging the fight which cemented his place as boxings biggest promoter. Also,later in the decade he would ironically prove to be the actual nemesis of both Ali and Foreman.  The musical interlude is overlong and not particularly relevant to the developments in hand. As regards,the depiction of the fight,which incidentallyI have seen in its entirety on tape I find it hopelessly fixated on Ali's rope a dope strategy. I remember in the uncut fight that Ali seemed to quite comfortable throughout the rounds scoring points with good jabs and bouncing off the ropes scoring combinations and swaying away from Foreman's headshots by lying on the loosened ropes and absorbing whatever he had to give. For whatever reason poor George seems to punching in slow motion and almost falling asleep even from the third round onwards. To be truthful I could name dozens of greater heavyweight fights. When We Were Kings is inspiring no doubt;the sight of relatively youthful Ali,unburdenned by disease,cracking jokes and reciting his poetry and commanding by the sheer force of his personality is unforgettable. But I think the film-makers have made a mistake in elevating the broader significance of this fight and in doing so, simplified the political and social complexities of the time surrounding this fight;I think When We Were Kings can be seen as a feelgood drama in which the individual triumphs against unsuperable odds despite the best efforts opponents and forces both internal and external.

894324,3,630451493X,"There is a large hole in this film, and it is in the depiction of the actual fight itself. Everything that led up to the fight is brilliantly presented.  This is Ali in all of his greatness. You see his fight strategy unfold as the film progresses. He turns the people of Zaire into his hometown crowd. You watch him psyche himself up by raising the stakes. The fight became more then the heavyweight championship. Ali was going to ""walk down the alley ways and sit with the wine heads, and talk to the prostitutes on the streets..."" Ali was going to better the world, and restore the black mans pride. All he had to do was beat Foreman first. And he loved to be the underdog. He loved to shock the world when nobody gave him a chance in hell of winning. You see him asking an audience of fight writers, ""Who's got George picked? Raise your hands. Who thinks George is gonna whup me?""  At a news conference he told Don King, ""I know you got George picked, but I'm gonna show you all just how great I am.""
By the time Ali stepped into the ring, Foreman didn't stand a chance. Ali was almost a decade past his prime, and Foreman was in the middle of his, but Ali was about to shred him, and this is where this film falls short. The fight is simply not accurately depicted. The film focuses almost exclusively on Ali's rope-a-dope strategy.  You are left with the impression that Ali was pounded on the ropes for 8 rounds, only to explode in a moment of glory, knocking out a tired and caught of guard Foreman.  That is simply not the way it happened. There were 8 rounds in this fight, and Ali won all 8 of them. True, he did lay on the ropes a lot, but that was only a portion of his strategy. He demoralized Foreman by taking his best shots, and scoffing at them. Ali would taunt Foreman, ""Is THAT all you got George?"" Then Ali would hit him with blistering combinations, almost at will. Foreman was staggered, several times. He was the perfect opponent for Ali because his head was a stationary target. Ali used it for a speed bag. Foreman's face was puffy and swollen by the third round. Ali's didn't have a mark on it. Even Joe Frazier, who was doing commentary during the fight had to admit, ""I don't think George is gonna make it."" He said that somewhere around the 5th.  Jim Brown, who was also doing commentary, repeated over and over again, ""Muhammad Ali is unreal."" But you see none of this in this film. Despite what the film shows you, Ali picked Foreman apart. He was way past his prime, but this was, no doubt, his finest hour.  Had Ali fought Foreman, or Frazier, or Norton, or anyone for that matter, when he was in his prime, their names would have been forgotten like all of the others that Ali disposed of early in his career. The name Joe Frazier would be familiar only to avid fight buffs, in the way the name Zorra Folley is now (one of Ali's early victims).

That  the fight happened at all, much less in Africa, is a story in itself worthy  of telling.  This film tells it very well.
How did the fight come to be  in Africa?  Was there any way that Ali could beat the younger, more  powerful Foreman, who had pummeled his previous opponents?  What was really  going through Ali's mind before the fight?  And who was this new guy Don  King?  Even though I knew the outcome of the fight, I was overwhelmed with  excitement throughout the entire film.

What I find equally  interesting about this movie is what we learn about Foreman who, at the  time, had none of the charisma and was not politically engaged in the  issues Ali was.  In many ways this fight shattered Foreman and it took many  years before he overcame his bitterness.  I think in many ways Foreman, due  to his lack of charisma then, was misunderstood, and you see his  frustration in the movie.

894386,5,630451493X,"Does anyone know where I can see a clip of the award presentation for this!  I wish they had included that video clip on the DVD - as extra footage.
This movie really surprised me - I thought I rented the new  George Clooney movie.  Just kidding - it was truly inspirational being able  to see that behind all the glitz and glamour - Ali was and is a real man  who was afraid as can be.  Not knowing the end result of the fight made it  extra special and tense for me - heck, I got tense in Apollo 13 trying to  figure out if ""they'd get back ok!""  :^)
Short of it all - I  highly recommend this movie - and the music is GREAT!  I wish they put more  comments on who the musicians were - I know it should be obvious - but it  wasn't to me - BB King I got, but many others I missed - it was a different  time...",958780800,,810,3.7724550898203595
894387,5,630451493X,"Intellectually, psychologically, politically, morally, spiritually, Muhammad Ali was the most electrifying, compelling, principled athlete of our time, maybe of all time.  Quick-thinking, a brilliant ring strategist,  a charismatic man of peace and hope, Ali used his boxing success and his  popularity to inspire people, bring political injustice to light, and,  maybe above all, to entertain.
This documentary brilliantly portrays  the complexities of Ali as well as the complexities of the United States  and of Zaire.  Ali becomes an emblem for African heritage, resistance to  the Viet Nam war, oppression in the USA, and the struggle of  African-Americans to forge an authentic identity.  Thus, the breadth and  depth of this movie.  The boxing match is the film's climax, but oddly, not  its focus, exactly.
The focus is much more on being African and  African-American.  Spike Lee weighs in.  So does Don King.  We hear stories  of atrocities in Zaire.  We hear James Brown, B. B. King, and also  interiews with citizens of Zaire.
In all of this brilliant coverage, I  thought George Foreman was portrayed sympathetically.  It would have ruined  this movie had Foreman been its stooge.  He wasn't.  Powerful, reserved,  confident, dignified, Foreman loses to Ali because Ali took a huge,  unpredictable risk; I think it was a measured risk on Ali's part, but Ali  banked on being able to withstand body punches long enough to tire out  Foreman and the movie shows us how Ali began working on this strategy very  early in his training.  Other ring strategy is discussed.  Norman Mailer  and George Plimpton add insightful analysis, especially of Ali's artistry.
I enjoyed every moment of this film:  the music, boxing clips,  interviews, historical background, political exploration, religious  dimensions, everything.",958003200,,1825,5.347517730496454
894388,4,630451493X,"This is by far the best documentary I have ever seen.  Ali is captured in his finest hour when he beats Foreman in the ""Rumble in the Jungle"".  Ali is viewed in his early days when he beat Liston up to  when he beat Foreman.  I have never seen such an exciting documentary.",952992000,,273,4.09433962264151
894389,5,630451493X,"I can tell you straight out, I am not a fan of boxing.  When I was given this DVD as a gift, I was very skeptical, thinking this would just be another dull documentary focusing on the 'Rumble in the Jungle'.  I am very  happy to say that I was proved wrong.  This is more than a simple film  about boxing, it deals with many issues, political and cultural.  It is  moving seeing Ali getting in touch with his African roots and seeing the  effect of this great humanitarian on the citizens of Zaire.  Norman Mailer  and George Plimpton give us an indepth commentary of what it was like to  know the man, and the static atmosphere in Kinsasha during the time of the  training and the night of the fight.  A well edited film coupled with music  by BB King and James Brown among others has made this THE documentary of  the decade, richly deserving the Oscar it received.",951609600,7,867,4.33125
894390,5,630451493X,"What I really love about this movie is the way it revives the lost art of sports storytelling.  Nowadays, major sports events are told in cold, statistical, terms.  Sometimes they'll run biographies on players, telling  how they grew up in a poor community in Georgia, but you never really get  inside their head.
And if there were ever an athelete whose head you  eirther could or would want to get into, it's Muhammed Ali.  As we go  through the movie we begin to see through Ali's bluster and begin to  realize that he's nervous.  Norman Mailer points out how every day, Ali  would have to go into the gym where Foreman had just been working out, and  see the immense dent in Foreman's punching bag.  Ali knows that he's  reaching the age where boxing not just becomes more difficult, but  extremely dangerous, especially when dealing with a juggernaut like  Foreman.
My favorite scene in the film occurs between the first and  second rounds.  Ali has been confusing Foreman with right-hand leads, but  all they've accomplished is making Foreman furious.  Ali now finds himself  pitted against an opponent who is stronger than him, younger than him, and  determined to knock him out, (to paraphrase Maiier's comments.)  We see  Ali, stunned by the first round of boxing, staring blankly at the canvas.  Suddenly, we see his eyes and face focus, and he gives a little nod to  himself.  He cries to the crowd, ""BOMA YE!"" In the next five  rounds he will use the rope-a-dope and finally emerge victorious.
I can  think of no greater scene in any movie.",949881600,,1552,4.711610486891386
894391,5,630451493X,"How this splendid documentary fascinates! I think of the ""No Fear"" slogans plastered here and there, and how this film tells us that, even among the best of us, fear is the TRUTH. Ali had good reason to  fear Foreman, a big and strong fighter who hit harder than anyone known.  Despite his antics and his loud assertions that there is ""Nothing to  be scared of,"" the movie gives us priceless zoom-ins to Ali's face...  his eyes... and the essence of his fears. But ""When We Were  Kings"" goes on to explore how Ali kept himself focused on the  challenge, acting bravely in spite of it all. We can see the brilliant  ""psychological warfare"" that Ali waged, and how he used ingenious  ploys to rise above fears that would unravel ordinary mortals.
 Beyond  depicting a splendid account of how one man faced his fears, and triumphed  in the end, this film also captures the ""feel"" of emerging  African pride in the 1970s. (A scene where Ali describes differences  between African American blues music and music typical of white tastes is  just hilarious). Also, it does give Foreman his due -- he went into a deep  depression after the fight but worked himself out of it, reinvented  himself, and emerged later as a different kind of champion.  Yes, it is not  surprising that a film like this would be popular with the  ""motivational"" circuit. Watch it when you feel the need to give  yourself a good jolt out of your own fearful inaction in confronting what  you need to do.",949363200,3,1472,4.6061776061776065
