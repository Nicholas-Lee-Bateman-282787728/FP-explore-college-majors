3122815,5,B00144P9ZM,"Not only did I get the first 4 seasons for HALF PRICE, but as I said above, I am THOROUGHLY entertained, and happy with my purchase. I had forgotten $ 7,000 annual salaries, and 26 minute episodes (yes, the show used to rule, NOT the commercials ),not to mention the bonus of mini-skirts. I recommend this Classic show very highly. HI GUYS !",1210550400,5,341,4.428571428571429
3122816,1,B00144P9ZM,"My only reason for the low star rating is this...  What nerve!  I agree with other comments regarding the release of this package when the remaining seasons are still being held back!  It's further evidence of continued greed and lack of artistic integrity on the part of the money-makers behind this sham.  What makes them think we're so stupid? (Indeed, I would be extremely disappointed and saddened to learn that any of the talented performers are behind holding back the final 3 seasons of this show.)  As many others, I already own the first 4 seasons of this extraordinary MTM series and it's by far one of the best written, performed TV programs ever produced. We have been waiting eagerly for release of the remaining seasons. Why would anyone now be ""seduced"" into buying yet another package of already released DVDs?  If I weren't so in love with this show I'd actually consider boycotting purchase of the remaining seasons in protest!!  And why in the world is this listed ""...The complete season 1-4 by Nancy Walker?""  The talented lady has been dead for many years. What possible involvment could she have in the sale or promotion of this package?  My grandmother said it best; ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.""  What a sad state of affairs...  Release the remaining seasons for heaven's sake!",1209772800,9,1332,4.798245614035087
3122817,5,B00144P9ZM,"You will never find a better price than this for the fabulous Mary Tyler Moore Show Seasons 1 to 4! This bundled price is GREAT! Of course, everyone is patiently waiting for Seasons 5, 6 and 7, and I have heard there is a good chance that Season 5 is in the works soon! I hope this is true, as this show is so GREAT, that fans just have to have it all! Let's hope that Foxtvdvd listens to Mary's theme song and that when it comes to the complete series of the much loved Mary Tyler Moore Show, we hope that Fox, ""You're gonna make it after all!""- COMPLETE! But, until then, for those of you wanting all the 4 Seasons that are on DVD, you can't beat this GREAT Bundled Deal!",1207958400,6,673,4.067669172932331
3122818,5,B00144P9ZM,"Our whole family loves this show. We own the four seasons that have been released, and never tire of watching and re-watching. I can't imagine why Fox will not release the final three seasons. They would have to be bigger sellers than some of the junk that is currently being released!",1206748800,15,285,4.607843137254902
3122819,1,B00144P9ZM,"Why are they bothering to package these season when people know that fox are relctant to release the final 3 seasons. I would hardly part with my money if I knew that if I purchased this that all I would get in an incomplete series release.
This is the only reason that I have given it a(zero rating if I could)one star rating.....The series itself is beyond gold.",1205366400,9,364,4.367647058823529
3122820,5,B00144P9ZM,"I live in Melbourne, Australia, and I have always been a fan of Mary Tyler Moore and especially her 1970 series The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  After many years of trying to obtain copies of the show, Amazon gave me the opportunity to purchase Seasons 1-4.  What I have looked at so far brings back many fond memories of a very talented lady.  I hope the remaining series are released so that I can buy them also.",1242518400,,409,4.285714285714286
3122821,5,B00144P9ZM,very happy to find the great deal for multi seasons of this show.  I always enjoyed watching it and still enjoy watching it.,1234828800,,124,4.391304347826087
3122822,5,B00144P9ZM,"I would highly recommend this movie series to anyone who grew up watching Mary!  I have been driving my husband crazy watching it so much.  I just love the friendship between Mary and Rhoda and we all wanted to be ""Mary"".  Have a job like her...have an apartment like her...
even have Rhoda as our ""Best Friend"".  Get these DVD's you won't be sorry! Enjoy!",1231977600,,356,4.430769230769231
3122823,5,B00144P9ZM,My husband and I have been enjoying watching every minute of this show.  Mary Tyler Moore is classic!  I have several favorite episodes already.  They need to HURRY UP and release the last few seasons because I'm almost through with these after just a month!,1229385600,,258,4.688888888888889
3122824,5,B00144P9ZM,"I LOVE The Mary Tyler Moore Show,and the first 4 years 70-74 were my favorite show. Its great to have all 4 in one box set.
This TV series brings back such good memories when Life was so much better than it is today.",1226275200,,216,3.9318181818181817
3122825,5,B00144P9ZM,This MTM series is wonderful.  I'd forgotten how funny the shows were.  Well worth the money. I plan to purchase the rest of the series.,1225584000,,136,4.4
3122826,5,B00144P9ZM,"Shows good for what you get.  Thought it was all the seasons that had been aired.  Not so, it aired for 7 seasons.  Where are the rest?",1223251200,,135,3.925925925925926
3122827,5,B00144P9ZM,"My review of seasons 1 to 4:  Buy this set!  At $15 a season for what is arguably
the finest sitcom in history it is worth it.  It grew from a good if conventional first
season to something truly special in seasons 3 and 4.  It had no harsh edges but
was funny and engaging and lacked false sentimentality.  While mostly avoiding the
issues of the day it did present the steady growth and maturity of Mary Richards
(the lead character played by Ms. Moore) that fit the maturing of the feminist
movement in the 1970s and did so in a realistic way. But the writing and humor
always took first place (I can think of only one true ""message show"" and it was one
of the worst episodes of the series). BELOW is the truly important news though and
Amazon helped bring this about.

The great news for MTM fans (and I apologize if this has been posted here already)
is that a Fox executive has just announced they will now release the last 3 seasons
on DVD.  Thank you Fox, Oprah, and especially the persistent fan base here at Amazon.
I had frankly given up on this happening as I thought the release of seasons 3 & 4 at
lower prices but still disappointing sales represented Fox's giving it its last ""old-college
try.""  But apparently despite ""financial realities"" Fox realizes how special it is to own
the rights to MTM and that with so much else of lesser quality being released they should
complete the series on DVD.  Again, thanks to all!  And if you've never seen MTM, you
won't regret purchasing it.  The writing, acting, and especially character development
are top notch!",1220313600,3,1572,4.480701754385965
3122828,5,B00144P9ZM,"The MTM Show brings back lots of memories from the past when ""TV sitcoms were funny!""  Reality programming didn't exist in the 70s and thus creative writers were truly appreciated by the viewing public.  My TV isn't on much anymore in the evening.  Shame.",1220313600,,255,4.75
3122829,5,B00144P9ZM,"I just read this info in the NY Times 8/31/08 - a release date was not given, but the last 3 seasons are on their way...",1220227200,,120,3.6538461538461537
3122834,5,B00144P9ZM,"Watching these old episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show has been really fun for me.  It has brought me back to a simpler time which sometimes you need in this complicated world.  It's fun to watch how the show progresses even techniqually with each season.  Lets face it, they just don't write shows like these anymore!  Especially good to watch during the summer months when there are only repeats on anyway. the only criticism I would have is the that the editing was sloppy in some of the shows, but you might not really notice it and it didn't take away from enjoying them.  If you are an MTM fan than you'll love these DVD's.",1220054400,,631,4.405172413793103
3122835,5,B00144P9ZM,"This is an all-time classic show. Like many of the reviewers here, I couldn't wait for this box set to come out. I bought the seasons as they were released. It has been more than two years since Fox released the fourth season. Same goes for another absolute 1970s class, The Bob Newhart Show. It can't be about sales. These were both very popular shows in their day. They both are as funny as ever - even funnier now in the sense that by watching them these days you see the obvious weakness in the writing of modern tv. I've had it with waiting. There is lots on my wish list. Fox is not getting another penny from me until they start releasing the remaining seasons of these two MTM classics. That's it. End of discussion. Are the Fox bean counters listening yet?",1218412800,,765,4.356643356643357
3122836,5,B00144P9ZM,I love the Mary Tyler Moore Show but I feel that fans have been coned into buying the first four seasons and now we the loyal fans are not able to complete our collection. I would like to suggest to anyone that is thinking about buying the first 4 seasons on DVD not to do so. regardless how much you love Mary don't do it because you will end up like so many of us fans being disappointed because the remaining 3 seasons are not available and you are going to end up watching your 4 seasons over and over until they wear out.,1217462400,,526,4.0673076923076925
3122837,5,B00144P9ZM,I was very happy to get this as it reminds me of a time in my life where I has a stepsister who reminded me of Mary's character. It was a happy time to watch it and to see how young single independent women acted in the real world. I love the writing and the line deliveries... It is sentimental but funny sentimental. I also like it that I have the 1st. box set. I believe that there were 7 seasons.. so by the time they release that I will have finished. but I can watch it over and over again. Just like Golden Girls..,1217116800,,521,3.9714285714285715
3122838,5,B00144P9ZM,It seems as though the majority of the other reviewers wins...this set of Seasons 1-4 is perfectly boxed and priced...now we're all waiting for Seasons 5-7.  (I'm sure good things come to those who wait!),1216684800,,204,4.828571428571428
3122839,5,B00144P9ZM,Any television addict would love to have this set in their home.  Mary Tyler Moore plays a single woman in her 30s making it on her own without a man.  The seasons in this collection just get better and better.  I can't think of any show I enjoy watching in a evening marathon than this one.  So fun!,1216598400,2,300,4.120689655172414
3122840,5,B00144P9ZM,"If you would like a refreshing, smart, funny sophisticated alternative to the increasingly grotesque sludge passed off as sitcoms today, you couldn't do much better than the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  I have frequently gone back to take a look at television's golden oldies and been shocked at how little satisfaction there was in the dated humor, styles, etc.  But this one was different.  It's not the only one that stands up to the test of time, of course, (Cosby will always please), but it's right up there at the top.  The humor is sophisticated, yet tasteful, and never condescending.  Mary and company are so human and so easy to relate to, even thirty years after the fact.  I laughed and, sometimes cried, totally involved, as I walked step-by-step through the first four seasons with this wonderful cast (and amazing writers).  The best thing about it is that I have three Moore seasons to look forward to, as soon as they box them up.",1215993600,3,943,4.713414634146342
3122841,5,B00144P9ZM,"Brought back those great 1970's Saturday nights on CBS. This was one of the best sitcoms ever to appear on TV; right up there with Dick van Dyke and M*A*S*H.

3122852,5,B00144P9ZM,"So far I have seasons 1 to 4. It was a simpler time then back in the 70's when a good show didn't have to use 4 letter words or toilet humor to get a hearty laugh. If you want to have a good time watching a great series, this is the show to get. It is as funny now as it was then. You won't be disappointed.",1214611200,,307,3.5294117647058822

Oh, my gosh, the clothes! Mary's outfits are even better than I remembered! Everyone says ""you can't go back."" That's true of life for any generation. But for a few moments, when the world is too much with me, I can enjoy a time when there was intelligent conversation, humor without cursing, and a beautiful lady whose smile lit up the world.",1214438400,,513,4.298969072164948

3122856,5,B00144P9ZM,"I haven't had time to watch all of the DVDs but the ones I have watched are excellent, enabling me to relive the years they were on Television.  This was one series on Television that was so well written and acted that it's no wonder it was so popular.  We can notice how times have changed -- the style of the dresses (Mary's short skirts) but mostly no computers in the news room !!!! I saw Mary, Lou and Murray on Oprah the other day and that peaked my interest in getting the DVDs of all the shows.",1213833600,,502,4.112244897959184
3122857,5,B00144P9ZM,"Steve Feldstein, Fox's Senior Vise President for Corporate and Marketing Communications, claims that The Mary Tyler Moore Show Seasons 5, 6 and 7 WILL make it to DVD.

Season 1 arrived on DVD in 2002.
Seasons 2-4 arrived on DVD in 2005 and 2006.

But all was quiet for WMJ since that time.

Maybe this time, Fox will take some responsibility for their failures, and release the last three seasons of The Mary Tyler Moore Show on DVD in 2009.

December, 2008 would be a nice time, to release Season 5.

Fans have waited way, way too long, to collect all 7 Seasons on DVD!

Please keep the hope, of The Mary Tyler Moore Show being completed on DVD, ALIVE!",1213488000,,653,4.4

It is for those customers who do not own ANY of the complete season dvds.  The customer who buys 4 bundled seasons for $59.99 total, actually saves about $10.00 per season, compared to those of us who individually bought 4 seasons for about $25.00 per season, totaling about $100 bucks.",1212710400,6,455,4.6625

I heard about the MTM Box Set and thought, ""Yes! About time!"" I have bought each DVD since the Season One was released. I've always wondered what was the holdup, like every other fan. It's such a freakish wonder, why shows like Punky Brewster are released before this classic show. Same goes for Bob Newhart. Where are the remaining seasons for THAT classic???
So I find out that the hype is over the same DVDs I already own, just in a box.
I give it a few stars for the greatness of the show, but dropped the score for the inexplicable actions. Next time there's a reunion and a ""box set,"" please make it for something new.",1212624000,5,797,4.503448275862069

3122861,5,B00144P9ZM,"Over 30 years since leaving the air, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" remains the absolute finest of TV sit-coms. Perhaps the secret of this show's success is that it's easy to feel a part of the WJM family, to share Mary and her friends' triumphs and tragedies, and savor each detail of their always interesting lives. Besides several series regulars, the first 96 episodes of ""Mary"" include such unforgettable characters as Sue Ann Nivens (The Happy Homemaker) and Chuckles the Clown (""A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants"").

Throughout, we see our friends evolve and are introduced to people important to them:
In the 4th season, buffoonishly egotistical news anchor Ted Baxter meets (and fawns over) his idol, Walter Cronkite. The mother of best buddy Rhoda shows up early in season #1, while her dad doesn't put in an appearance until the third year. Ted meets Georgette for the first time that same season, when he attends a moving-to-NYC party for Rhoda (who ultimately decides to stay in Minneapolis). Mary's parents, Ted's brother and the father he never knew, Mary's old beaus-- all these and more are gradually added to the mix. If you're an MTM fan from way back, you'll enjoy these stories all over again, but if you've come to the party late, you have a big treat in store for you with this wonderful collection of Mary Tyler Moore's first four seasons.

REGULAR CAST: Mary Tyler Moore (Mary Richards), Gavin MacLeod (Murray Slaughter), Ted Knight (Ted Baxter), Edward Asner (Lou Grant), Valerie Harper (Rhoda Morgenstern)
FREQUENT CO-STARS: Georgia Engels (Georgette Franklin), Cloris Leachman (Phyllis Lindstrom), Betty White (Sue Ann Nivens), John Amos (Gordy Howard), Joyce Bulifant (Marie Slaughter), Lisa Geritsen (Bess Lindstrom)

I agree with other comments regarding the release of this package when the remaining seasons are still being held back!  It's further evidence of continued greed and lack of artistic integrity on the part of the money-makers behind this sham.  What makes them think we're so stupid? (Indeed, I would be extremely disappointed and saddened to learn that any of the talented performers are behind holding back the final 3 seasons of this show.)  As many others, I already own the first 4 seasons of this extraordinary MTM series and it's by far one of the best written, performed TV programs ever produced. We have been waiting eagerly for release of the remaining seasons. Why would anyone now be ""seduced"" into buying yet another package of already released DVDs?  If I weren't so in love with this show I'd actually consider boycotting purchase of the remaining seasons in protest!!  And why in the world is this listed ""...The complete season 1-4 by Nancy Walker?""  The talented lady has been dead for many years. What possible involvment could she have in the sale or promotion of this package?  My grandmother said it best; ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.""

I hope this is true, as this show is so GREAT, that fans just have to have it all! Let's hope that Foxtvdvd listens to Mary's theme song and that when it comes to the complete series of the much loved Mary Tyler Moore Show, we hope that Fox, ""You're gonna make it after all!""- COMPLETE!

3357324,5,B00144P9ZM,"My review of seasons 1 to 4:  Buy this set!  At $15 a season for what is arguably
the finest sitcom in history it is worth it.  It grew from a good if conventional first
season to something truly special in seasons 3 and 4.  It had no harsh edges but
was funny and engaging and lacked false sentimentality.  While mostly avoiding the
issues of the day it did present the steady growth and maturity of Mary Richards
(the lead character played by Ms. Moore) that fit the maturing of the feminist
movement in the 1970s and did so in a realistic way. But the writing and humor
always took first place (I can think of only one true ""message show"" and it was one
of the worst episodes of the series). BELOW is the truly important news though and
Amazon helped bring this about.

The great news for MTM fans (and I apologize if this has been posted here already)
is that a Fox executive has just announced they will now release the last 3 seasons
on DVD.  Thank you Fox, Oprah, and especially the persistent fan base here at Amazon.
I had frankly given up on this happening as I thought the release of seasons 3 & 4 at
lower prices but still disappointing sales represented Fox's giving it its last ""old-college
try.""  But apparently despite ""financial realities"" Fox realizes how special it is to own
the rights to MTM and that with so much else of lesser quality being released they should
complete the series on DVD.  Again, thanks to all!  And if you've never seen MTM, you
won't regret purchasing it.  The writing, acting, and especially character development
are top notch!",1220313600,3,1572,4.480701754385965

It has brought me back to a simpler time which sometimes you need in this complicated world.  It's fun to watch how the show progresses even techniqually with each season.  Lets face it, they just don't write shows like these anymore!  Especially good to watch during the summer months when there are only repeats on anyway. the only criticism I would have is the that the editing was sloppy in some of the shows, but you might not really notice it and it didn't take away from enjoying them.

It has been more than two years since Fox released the fourth season. Same goes for another absolute 1970s class, The Bob Newhart Show. It can't be about sales. These were both very popular shows in their day. They both are as funny as ever - even funnier now in the sense that by watching them these days you see the obvious weakness in the writing of modern tv. I've had it with waiting. There is lots on my wish list. Fox is not getting another penny from me until they start releasing the remaining seasons of these two MTM classics. That's it. End of discussion.

I would like to suggest to anyone that is thinking about buying the first 4 seasons on DVD not to do so. regardless how much you love Mary don't do it because you will end up like so many of us fans being disappointed because the remaining 3 seasons are not available and you are going to end up watching your 4 seasons over and over until they wear out.,1217462400,,526,4.0673076923076925

I also like it that I have the 1st. box set. I believe that there were 7 seasons.. so by the time they release that I will have finished. but I can watch it over and over again.

I have frequently gone back to take a look at television's golden oldies and been shocked at how little satisfaction there was in the dated humor, styles, etc.  But this one was different.  It's not the only one that stands up to the test of time, of course, (Cosby will always please), but it's right up there at the top.  The humor is sophisticated, yet tasteful, and never condescending.  Mary and company are so human and so easy to relate to, even thirty years after the fact.  I laughed and, sometimes cried, totally involved, as I walked step-by-step through the first four seasons with this wonderful cast (and amazing writers).

3357358,5,B00144P9ZM,"Over 30 years since leaving the air, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" remains the absolute finest of TV sit-coms. Perhaps the secret of this show's success is that it's easy to feel a part of the WJM family, to share Mary and her friends' triumphs and tragedies, and savor each detail of their always interesting lives. Besides several series regulars, the first 96 episodes of ""Mary"" include such unforgettable characters as Sue Ann Nivens (The Happy Homemaker) and Chuckles the Clown (""A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants"").

Throughout, we see our friends evolve and are introduced to people important to them:
In the 4th season, buffoonishly egotistical news anchor Ted Baxter meets (and fawns over) his idol, Walter Cronkite. The mother of best buddy Rhoda shows up early in season #1, while her dad doesn't put in an appearance until the third year. Ted meets Georgette for the first time that same season, when he attends a moving-to-NYC party for Rhoda (who ultimately decides to stay in Minneapolis). Mary's parents, Ted's brother and the father he never knew, Mary's old beaus-- all these and more are gradually added to the mix. If you're an MTM fan from way back, you'll enjoy these stories all over again, but if you've come to the party late, you have a big treat in store for you with this wonderful collection of Mary Tyler Moore's first four seasons.

REGULAR CAST: Mary Tyler Moore (Mary Richards), Gavin MacLeod (Murray Slaughter), Ted Knight (Ted Baxter), Edward Asner (Lou Grant), Valerie Harper (Rhoda Morgenstern)
FREQUENT CO-STARS: Georgia Engels (Georgette Franklin), Cloris Leachman (Phyllis Lindstrom), Betty White (Sue Ann Nivens), John Amos (Gordy Howard), Joyce Bulifant (Marie Slaughter), Lisa Geritsen (Bess Lindstrom)

8254359,5,B00144P9ZM,"I love Mary Tyler Moore what an amazing lady, she has true style, intelligence and grace, which all come through in her TV show.  It is easy to see why this mini series won so many awards.

I have just started watching the seasons and have not been disappointed.  My husband and I watch a couple of episodes twice a week and we look forward to this.  Mary, Ted, Rhoda, Lou, Phyllis and Murray were great together and once I have finished these four series I will be sending away for the rest.

Not rocket science just a lovely way to spend a bit of time watching shows they new how to put together.

Highly recommended.",1294444800,,619,4.293103448275862
8254360,5,B00144P9ZM,"My mom is a huge fan of this show and we were raised on classic tv from Dick Van Dyke,Patty Duke, and Mary Tyler Moore. So purchacing the first for season was an easy choice they are great episodes. I wish Nick At Night would go back to realy showing the original classics. But at least we can get them on DVD!!! Mary Tyler Moore played a breakthrough part as a single working woman who was independant and not helpless. This is a must have for any classic tv collector.",1262995200,,470,4.233333333333333

The picture quality and the audio quality on these DVD's is excellent, but I do have a problem. Season one, there is no list of episodes, nothing. A flap on the inside of the box had only a brochure for other TV series, no episode lists. This flaw caused me not to give this item 5 stars.",1253491200,2,381,4.162162162162162

The only problem was the delivery, i received one of the plastic boxes broken...i wrote to amazon.com, but they didn't solve my problem. About that i'm really upset...
