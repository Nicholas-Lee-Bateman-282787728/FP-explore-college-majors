Who is traveling incognito to the palace while fighting of would be assassins.  Not as good as other Gordon Liu movie such as the 36 chamber of Sholin.

8172574,4,B000MV8AR2,"I Like the creative martial choreography!
This is old school kung-fu cinema back when I could watch a triple feature, then get back home on the public transportation all for less than a fin!",1403222400,2,190,4.617647058823529
8172575,4,B000MV8AR2,"Despite it's name 'Dirty Ho' IS indeed a kung-fu movie. After being discovered by Master Liu, Ho (the dirty thief) asks to be trained to learn the way of the kung-fu fighter. Legendary Shaw Brothers actor Gordon Liu plays the role of the mentor in this kung-fu flick which surprisingly is not chocked full of revenge filled, clich storylines.

For the majority of the movie, the fight scenes are relatively tame, in a cool and creative way. Instead of just having a bunch of all out brawls, Liu's character visit's several 'friends' where they (almost respectfully) battle with tea cups and Chinese hand fans. The choreography in these scenes is fantastic and pretty fun to watch. Not after long, Ho is given a rigorous training regiment in order to prepare for a more intense battle.

In one of the final fight scenes there is almost a Lone Wolf and Cub scenario going on, where Ho is wheeling around Master Liu in a cart as they battle dozens of foes. Finally Ho and Liu stand together, finishing the movie on a tandem fight scene.",1399075200,4,1033,4.639344262295082
8172576,5,B000MV8AR2,If you are a Gordon Liu fan then this is a must have for the collection.  It's funny and creative kung fu scenes.,1396915200,,113,3.9130434782608696
