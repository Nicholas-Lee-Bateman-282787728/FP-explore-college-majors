 freakish quirks. Good acting performances all around. This is a must see film.",1509753600,,224,5.054054054054054
8178860,3,B000NJWTPC,"I guess someone smarter than me (that' not hard) may figure out what it was all about.

But don't watch it on my recommendation. This one is DEFINITELY a hit or miss!!!

Still not sure if there was or wasn't anything supernatural about it.",1491523200,,239,4.409090909090909
8178861,1,B000NJWTPC,Didnt really find this movie all that great. Confusing storyline and not enough going on..,1471564800,,90,5.066666666666666
8178862,4,B000NJWTPC,"Found this film on my wanderings and said what the heck.  I was impressed.  A take on Fall of the House of Usher redone to be an Andy Milligan film- and I mean that as a compliment, this film had as much a stage play reference as a horror film refernce point.  Solid performances- Suzanne Bertish was phenomenal and she reminded me of Claire Higgins from Hellraiser (at some point those two should work together, just a wish!)I love it when this kind of thing happens: you pick up a film with a shoddy cover just to try it out for a bit of ""movie exploring"" and you wind up with something really impressive.  However, not for the slasher movie types out there.  It is more of a drama than anything else.  But, like I said, if you are into films like ""Seeds of Sin"" you must absolutely view this.",1271635200,,795,4.266666666666667
8178863,3,B000NJWTPC,"Not a big fan of scary movies, but I didn't mind watching this movie. The story is cool, it makes sense. The effects may not be the best, but they are good enough to get you scare. It is not a bad movie.

8178864,1,B000NJWTPC,"Just watched this on hulu and I have to say this was the worst film in the history of cinema.  No sort of coherent plot, terrible acting, confusing camera work, poor lighting, and zombie clown witch stuffed animal demons?

I rate this zero stars but amazon won't let me.",1242777600,,270,4.489795918367347
8178865,4,B000NJWTPC,"First off, the box art is rather deceiving. Despite what is shown on the cover, there are no girls in pigtails wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform going on a murderous rampage with a hammer (That's what I thought when I picked it up to rent from a local Blockbuster). It doesn't take place anywhere near an attic, and really no reason why the toybox is bloody. So that's out of the way...

The story is really about a girl, Berenice (Claudine Spiteri), and her boyfriend Conrad (Craig Henderson), coming home from college to spend Christmas with her family in the English countryside. The family consists of a doting (and kinda mentally ""out there"") grandmother, a mother who flirts with any man near her, a father preoccupied with telling bad jokes and defending his family from what he believes to be a stalker, and a sullen and moody younger brother (Elliot Jordan). Throughout the film, the girl and her brother reveal that when they were kids, they liked to imagine that they were living in a local myth about witches and a vicious murdering clown (Why does it always have to be clowns?). Little do they know, that the myth is becoming reality. (Ooooooh, creepy)

The movie has some pretty good performances, but the story drags on from time to time. There are some times where the director does a real good job with ratcheting up the tension in some scenes where it's impossible to look away from the screen, especially towards the end when the villain (don't want to reveal too much) finally shows up and goes on a murderous spree. The production design, though, tends to look plain and make the movie seem more boring.

Special features include:

Four movie trailers- The Brink (Looks like a cross between The Evil Dead and Signs), A Mexican Werewolf in Texas (Actually a film about the Chupacabra), Death Clique (Bunch of teens in a house with a killer, that's all), and Tears of Kali: The Dark Side of New Age (I have no idea what happened, but I think it's German)

A commentary by the director Paolo Sedazzari, producer Simon Mason, Henderson, and 2nd unit director, Pete Clapton.",1179014400,12,2094,4.7103825136612025
