8306300,4,B001GNG2YI,"Loved it. Great reminder of the kind of movie acting of the time. There is nothing to compare with it today. Lots of blood, and gore these days, however, no quality acting.",1395878400,,172,4.40625
8306301,3,B001GNG2YI,"Purchased because I thought it was a Burke Laws I didn't have, but enjoyed the other episodes too. Just remember it is in black & white and from the early days of television so quality of today isn't' there. But if you remember the stories as a youngster or just like 60's TV/Detectives or any of the actors, this is a good collection to have.",1389744000,,343,4.292307692307692
8306302,2,B001GNG2YI,"Remember this as a go to program when they started programming. Stories lines weak, to much about the star and no good mysteries. Will not buy more!",1365897600,,148,4.518518518518518

8306305,1,B001GNG2YI,"I bought this DVD because I LOVE the television program Peter Gunn. I've been searching for more episodes other than the ones on the two volume box sets released by A&E a few years ago. Amazon did not list what was on this DVD but it was pretty reasonably priced so I bought it in hopes of two never released episodes. No such luck - this DVD contains very poor quality prints of 2 Peter Gunn episodes (Let's Kill Timothy and The Fuse- both of which are on the A&E sets), 1 Burke's Law (Who Killed Jason Shaw?) and 2 Richard Diamond episodes (Picture of Fear and The Merry Go Round Case). The famous Peter Gunn theme music has been replaced by some cheesy music (probably a copyright issue) and the Burke's Law is such poor quality it's hard to watch. The 2 Richard Diamond episodes have some old commercials for Maxwell House Coffee included. The DVD case itself has an awful petroleum smell that about knocks you out when you open it. Buyer beware!",1236988800,57,950,4.434285714285714
