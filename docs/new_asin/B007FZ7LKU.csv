5084168,5,B007FZ7LKU,had to buy this one to complete the collection;  it includes Ernest Goes to School...just what we have been looking for.,1355356800,,120,4.714285714285714
5084169,1,B007FZ7LKU,"5 of the finest ? Huh ? Then explain why the set DOESN'T have 5 of the finest entries in the Ernest library. Where's Saves Christmas, Goes To Camp, Scared Stupid, or even Goes To Jail ? I am aware that not all movies are owned by the same company. But doesn't Mill Creek have the rights to Camp, Jail, and Scared Stupid ? This may be worth it for the unreleased movies, but they really shouldn't have lied in the description.",1352505600,4,425,4.195121951219512
5084170,2,B007FZ7LKU,"This is a great selection of movies. I was SOOOO excited when I pre-ordered it a few months ago. It arrived last week in the mail and we've since watched 2 out of the 10 discs. Unfortunately, whoever converted these movies onto DVD did an absolutely HORRIBLE job. It's barely watchable. I almost feel like returning it for my money back because it's so bad. For example, before Ernest Goes to School plays, there's a message ""This film has been modified from it's original version and formatted to fit your screen and to run in the allotted time"". The color is washed out and the scenes literally fade out and back in as if there are commercial breaks. Did this company actually take the TV version of the movie and convert it to DVD? However, the quality of Ernest Goes to School could be considered astounding when you compare it to Slam Dunk Ernest. The tint appears to be turned all the way up to the point where all you can see are blue and orange blobs moving around on the screen.

It's like finding out that Vern wasn't a real person at all...",1348531200,30,1051,4.417525773195877
5084171,3,B007FZ7LKU,"This set is pretty ok for the money. It had the very hard to find films such as Ernest ride's again and Ernest goes to school. Picking this set up for those 2 films alone is worth it. But if you wanting the entire ernest collection, Well then your just going to have to buy all the movies by them self's. This contains only a few films and everything else is just never before seen footage, Some footage released threw different companies so it would be nothing new.",1348185600,7,466,4.306818181818182
5084172,4,B007FZ7LKU,"I wouldn't by any stretch of the imagination call this the ""Best"" of our favorite bumbling handyman, but that doesn't mean the set is not worth it. This set contains seven feature films, some of which are hard to find. ""Dr Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam,"" the first movie to contain Ernest has been out of print for some time. 1993's ""Ernest Rides Again"" was the last film to be released theatrically and has never been released on dvd. ""Ernest Goes To School"" (which also has never been released), ""Slam Dunk Ernest"" (starring basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), ""Ernest In The Army"" and ""Ernest Goes To Africa"" are also included on the set. These are the only movies I would consider ""Feature Films"" but the set claims ""Hey Vern! It's My Family Album"" and ""Your World As I See It"" as two more feature films. I see them more as a collection of clips along the lines of the other included material ""Ernest's Greatest Hits Volumes 1 and 2.""

Of course, the better-known films are not included on this set. Nevertheless, what is included are the rest of Ernest's work. Assuming one has bought all the previously released materials, you're getting two new movies (Rides Again and Goes To School), and a rare one that was hard to find when it was released (Dr Otto).

The package shown is a shell that holds two heavy cardboard holders that hold five disks each. The holders are similar to a TV season holder.

Overall, this set is worth it. Whether you're completing your Ernest collection or starting one this set is worth it.

1). ""Doctor Otto and The Riddle of the Gloom Beam"": Has many VHS tracking glitches in it. The source material for this film was probobly not the best. Most of the tracking glitches seem to happen about an hour into the movie.

2). ""Slam Dunk Ernest"": From the start, this film becomes heavily pixellated when there is a lot of movement on screen.

I've contacted Image Madacy Entertainment and will update if I get a responce.",1348099200,57,1963,4.610315186246418
5084173,5,B007FZ7LKU,"I can really? (who says that word anyways like that) tell you this is going to be the best, cause you finally get ERNEST RIDES AGAIN and ERNEST GOES TO SCHOOL, both has never been on dvd, not counting bootleg copies. Those two movies alone is worth the $20.00 but you get even more 10 dvds worth. I have already pre order this collection and can't wait to get it and if your a real fan then your order it too. Heck i would have paid $30.00 to $40.00 for this collection just to get those two movies, it is 10 dvds for the price of one. Now lets see if i can use this word- REALLY? REALLY? REALLY? YOUR GONNA COMPLAIN ABOUT A BARGIN LIKE THIS, ITS LIKE LOOKING A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH AND YOU KNOW YOUR BUY IT ANYWAYS, REALLY? REALLY? REALLY? YOU KNOW YOU WILL. That was kind of fun.",1347926400,,784,4.064516129032258
5084174,5,B007FZ7LKU,"Amazing, for $20 buy it right now!  Besides if you read the cover of the product in the picture it says that it has 7 feature films, 40 shorts, and hundreds of TV commercials, bloopers and other stuff.  Either way for $20 who cares what's on it, it's Jim Varney as Ernest!  Everyone should buy this immediately, knowhutimean?",1346976000,4,325,4.568965517241379
5084175,5,B007FZ7LKU,I can't wait for this box set to come out because it contains Ernest rides again and Ernest goes to school. I have loved watching Ernest since I was a little kid.,1335830400,8,162,4.09375
5084176,3,B007FZ7LKU,"Being an Ernest fan I would jump at the opertunity to own such a big set of his hilarious hick highjinks (try to say THAT three times fast). However, this set does not contain Ernest's best movies but rather some of his worst, and probably cheapest to make, movies. The only movies that I would get this for are Ernest Rides Again and Ernest Goes To School, the latter being the only good movie here. The above statement about the set mentions other material including the commercials that started Ernest's career in the first place, but it doesn't say which programs are on this set or to what extent. Bottom line: this is the first nice looking, and really big, Ernest set to hit store shelves, as well as marking the release of Goes To School on DVD for the first time, also amazon is selling it for a pretty decent price, but don't buy it until we learn more.",1334880000,6,863,4.4
5084207,2,B007FZ7LKU,This set was just ok for me I guess I expected more of the bigger titles he made to be included but they weren't. I should have done more looking into it as this was a gift for my husband.,1455753600,,188,3.725

5084214,1,B007FZ7LKU,"This is a review of the packaging. I have not had a chance to watch any of the content due to the fact that every disc in the set was scratched and covered with particles. Unfortunately, as sturdy and nice as this set looks and feels, it's construction is incredibly flawed. The packaging is similar to the much-maligned packaging of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B001ARDBWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen Collection [Blu-ray</a>], only worse. This is sturdier than that collection, but that's it. Instead of a smooth glossy surface for the discs to rest against, they rest against rough cardboard. Every single disc in the new set I received was damaged. I'm surprised more people have not returned the set, prompting Amazon to re-evaluate the listing and give Image/Madacy Home Entertainment feedback on their poor decision. Unfortunately, this is the only collection that contains DR. OTTO AND THE RRIDDLE OF THE GLOOM BEAM, which seems to be the major selling point. Image/Madacy should do the right thing and put the discs in 2 multi-disc plastic cases, release DR. OTTO separately, or give the rights up to Mill Creek, a company that will give the title better treatment.

Avoid this set. Let it go out of print. Maybe then the titles will end up in better hands.",1434153600,,1350,5.428571428571429

5084250,5,B007FZ7LKU,"This may not contain everything Ernest, but this gets you 80% there. The only reason not every film is included is because the other films are owned by different companies, but if you buy this the Ernest 3 film dvd set, and Ernest's Christmas, then you get everything Ernest!

Included are his famous commercials he did in the 90's which were so funny.

Ernest's Greatest Hits 1 and 2, Hey Vern, It's my family album, Your World as I see it, Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, Ernest in the Army, Ernest Rides Again, Ernest Goes to School, Slam Dunk Ernest, Ernest Goes to Africa.

5084253,3,B007FZ7LKU,I want to give this 5 stars because there is quite a good selection of Ernest movies etc here but quality dictates otherwise. It looks like they literally copied these over from vhs and didn't bother to even try and clean up the picture.,1420243200,,237,4.409090909090909

5084267,5,B007FZ7LKU,"For the people saying this has poor quality, I think for some of the features that have NEVER before had been released are just fine. Yes, it is kinda pixelated in some spots, but if you can show me Goes to School, Knowhutimean? Hey Vern, It's My Family Album, and Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam rendered in complete 1080p High definition, please do tell. Otherwise, don't be so picky, most of the Famous Ernest movies have already been released on blu-ray, most of you already have them.

5084272,1,B007FZ7LKU,"While it's obvious that the movies Jim Varney is known for are not included in this set, it's great that his lesser seen (and out of print) movies are collected in one place. That being said, the presentations are terrible.

Ernest Goes To Africa is a blow-up of a film matted at 1.85:1, so the subtitles are cut off.

Slam Dunk Ernest has been stretched to 16:9 which means everyone has football heads.

If you've never seen the selections included in this box set, feel free to check them out, but be prepared for a less than ideal viewing experience.",1394409600,4,553,4.51

5084275,2,B007FZ7LKU,"I am a big Ernest fan and I was really excited when I received this box set for Christmas, as it finally had all the Ernest movies I'd been missing from my collection, all together.  The selection is great, with 6 hard to find Ernest films (including Dr. Otto) and collections of Ernest commercials and shorts.  But the quality of these DVDs is terrible.  The video transfers are very low quality, with very washed out dull colors, and the audio at times sounds like it was pitched up or something.  In some scenes Ernest's normal speaking voice just sounded ""off"".  My VHS copy of ""Ernest Rides Again"" has significantly better visual and audio quality than the disc in this collection, and that's pretty sad (I think the VHS copy is even less cropped!).  At times it looks like someone recorded these movies off TV to a VHS *and then* transferred them to DVD.  awful.  The quality is understandable when it comes to ""Dr. Otto"" as the movie is older and rarer than all the rest, and it doesn;t really hurt the discs with the commercials or the shorts too much.  But the other movie discs are so bad they're almost painful to watch.  In the end I'd only recommend the set for Dr. Otto and the commercial discs if your interested.  but if you want these other 5 movies, try to find them somewhere else first.",1390003200,,1306,4.491525423728813
5084276,3,B007FZ7LKU,"If you're looking to complete your Ernest collection, you'll need this set because this is the only place so far where you can find Ernest Goes to School or Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam on DVD. That said... Dr. Otto appears to have been dubbed from an old VHS tape - it even has places where the tape was messed up - and Goes to School looks like someone taped it off the TV, converted it from PAL to NTSC, and uploaded a low quality version online before it was downloaded and burned to this disc. Everything else in the set can be found in other releases, and most of them look better on the other releases. The Greatest Hits shows, for instance, look dark and pixilated compared to the versions on the 'Essential Ernest' DVD set. For some of the programs, the quality is a bigger issue than for others.

Pros: Includes a couple really hard to find movies, the packaging is very sturdy and has nice artwork, offers a good overview of some of the lesser-known Ernest material

Cons: LOW QUALITY VIDEO

Personally, I think I'll make copies of the two films I didn't have, and then either sell the set for what I can get or give it away. To me, it was worth the price to complete my collection!",1389398400,,1206,4.3039647577092515
5084287,5,B007FZ7LKU,Great silly Ernest movies for all ages! If you can appreciate his goofy humor you've got to get this set !,1388448000,,106,4.095238095238095
5084288,5,B007FZ7LKU,great collection not all shows I was wanting but that's fine I cant say I like the cardboard disc holder tho.,1388188800,,109,4.238095238095238
5084289,5,B007FZ7LKU,Highly recommended for any Jim Varney fans not only does the set include the Ernest classics he is best known for but other snippets from early in his career. Highly recommended must have for any fans,1381190400,,200,4.583333333333333

5084292,5,B007FZ7LKU,"So I read many reviews before purchasing this product here on Amazon and I must say for the price this is an absolute steal!! For $19.93 plus tax you are getting 10 discs full of Ernest! The contents are as follows:

Volume 1 contains Hey Vern! It's my Family Album, Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, Ernest Greatest Hits - Volume 1, Ernest Greatest Hits - Volume 2, and Ernest in the Army

Volume 2 contains Ernest Rides Again, Ernest Goes to School, Your World As I See It, Slam Dunk Ernest, and Ernest Goes to Africa

The DVDs themselves come housed in two cardboard holders that flips open and is actually pretty sturdy. Both of these come housed in the box that is pictured here on Amazon. Each case also houses 5 DVDs each. Now, onto the quality...

I have read that a lot of people have a gripe about the movies' quality and here is my opinion about that...

I have watched Ernest Rides Again, Ernest Goes to School, Slam Dunk Ernest, Your World As I See It, Ernest Greatest Hits Vol. 1, so I have seen about 5/10 of the DVDs and yes, the quality isn't so great. Ernest Rides Again seems like it could have had a better transfer since it was released in theaters, but who knows what source material they had available to choose from? Goes to School is pretty decent and I have no real gripes with it but some of the colors are a bit washed out and the picture can seem kind of blurry at times. Slam Dunk Ernest is probably the best quality wise out of the 5 I have seen in my opinion and that isn't saying too much as it has some blurry-ness to it as well, though it is featured in widescreen. The other 2 I have seen are pretty average, but overall for the price this set just cannot be beat! $20 and you get 10 dics. If you are a diehard Ernest/Jim Varney fan then you must buy this set! Not to mention, the films have at least been converted to 2.0 Dolby Digital, and these probably won't even see a release again as many of them weren't ever very popular sadly. Anyways, thanks for reading this review and I hope it has been informative.",1357603200,14,2057,4.223918575063613
5084293,5,B007FZ7LKU,"Jesus has enfused Jim Varney with an enate ability to show His deep-rooted love for the kids.

5084294,4,B007FZ7LKU,My kids are thrilled with these shows of course. My only concern has been that the case itself doesn't seem to hold them very well. It's cardboard rather than plastic. I need to just transfer the discs to a different holder to make them more secure. But for the money you sure can't beat it. So many videos and such.
