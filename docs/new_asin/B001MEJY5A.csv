8320997,2,B001MEJY5A,"Silly, dated British comedy, interesting only for the 10-15 seconds of screen time for Audrey Hepburn in one of her first films.",1482624000,,128,4.863636363636363

8320999,5,B001MEJY5A,"The phrase ""sowing your wild oats"" used to refer the period in a young man's life when he felt free to have sex with as many people as possible, enjoy life, and have fun before settling down.  The phrase, though not the behaviour, has long ago dropped out of common usage.  You'll get the feeling of times long ago when watching this film, though it derives from a play written in 1948 and filmed in 1951.

Diminutive, bald-headed Robertson Hare is marvellous as the unlikely wild oats sower, and involved in the claims and counter claims, the scandals and the revelations are ""full on"" performances from Stanley Holloway, Sam Costa, Irene Handl, and Australian-born Vera Pearce. Enjoy also the first screen appearance of Audrey Hepburn.

The visual quality is excellent, as is the audio quality, but there are no sub titles.",1368230400,,825,4.829787234042553

8321001,5,B001MEJY5A,"Simply because Audrey Hepburn appears in it!

She plays the roll of a hotel receptionist.",1241913600,4,89,4.933333333333334
8321002,3,B001MEJY5A,"A seriously silly little gem with the great Robertson Hare (Oh, calamity! Balderdash!) as a much put upon little fellow whose daughter wants to marry the son of a bookmaker who lives in the same block of flats. Stanley  Holloway(who improbably appears in VERY butch drag) co-stars, not Audrey  Hepburn who appears in her first film as an hotel receptionist.(NB later  both she and Stanley would be together in ""My Fair Lady"". It's  the film of a play, and is stagey,(and incidentally not a brilliant print)  but a lovely period piece with daft dialogue, silly plot lines and the most  chaste kiss in films. Give it a go.",951955200,7,620,4.694444444444445
