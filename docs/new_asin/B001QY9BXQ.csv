3772065,5,B001QY9BXQ,"OMG..all I can say is I never laughed so hard in my entire life!! My sides hurt when I was driving home!! I went with a friend and on the way home, we were laughing so hard that we couldn't breathe. LISA IS THE BEST!!! LONG LIVE THE QUEEN INDEED!!!",1241136000,,248,3.98
3772066,3,B001QY9BXQ,"Let me start out by saying that in my book LL can do no wrong! Even on her worst day, she is funnier than most. After loving Dirty Girl I ran out and bought this DVD. While I enjoyed it, I did not feel it was was sophisticated or cutting edge as her previous outings. This concert seems to rely too heavily on name-calling and some really unfunny knock-knock type jokes. She seems to have less interaction with the audience this time around (one of the strengths of her lives shows) and just uses them to call names without much real depth. She has a few moments of brilliance and the rest is ok. Also, both Lisa and her fans are not easily offended, but I felt like she used a certain derogatory racial slur too much in this production, especially since it was not connected to a ""bit"" but was just used to cuss someone out. This DVD is still great fun, but not a must own.",1238630400,3,874,4.208333333333333
3772067,5,B001QY9BXQ,"My wife and I were at the live taping of this event last November in Santa Rosa, CA. We have never laughed so hard in our lives. Lisa Lampanelli's comedy is right up our alley; crude, rude, shocking, and uncut. You will love the guy that is sitting in the front row on the side, Lisa really gives it to him... It was great! Can't wait to see it again on DVD!!!",1235779200,3,360,4.013888888888889
3772068,4,B001QY9BXQ,"With all the ""PC"" nonsense in this world today, it's nice to see a comedian who doesn't walk on egg shells or pull any punches. Lampanelli is like a female Don Rickles who isn't a racist, but enjoys poking fun at the differences in all of us.  While I didn't find this particular show to be one of the funniest I've seen, I did enjoy that fact that every race was given equal time with insults! Lisa Lampanelli may not be the funniest comedian, but at least she is telling everyone to lighten up and laugh at ourselves!",1233705600,5,519,4.295918367346939
3772079,5,B001QY9BXQ,This DVD is absolutely hilarious. Lisa Lampanelli is indeed the queen of comedy. I laughed from the beginning to the end of this DVD.,1385337600,,133,4.583333333333333

3772081,5,B001QY9BXQ,"Lisa rocks. That's all. Buy this DVD now. One of the funniest people out there!
Though on a side note, comedy DVDs are a tough buy. It's hard to want to rewatch after watching a couple times, as you already know all the jokes.",1344124800,,226,4.159090909090909

3772084,3,B001QY9BXQ,I was a little disappointed in Lisa Lampannelli this time.  She doesn't use a lot of new material and the stuff that is new isn't all that funny.  It really wasn't worth what I paid for the DVD. I've laughed out loud more watching her on youtube than I have watching this DVD.,1262995200,,276,4.188679245283019
3772085,4,B001QY9BXQ,"I purchased this DVD Long Live The Queen after catching Lisa Lampanelli's show in Syracuse, NY back in Septemeber 09 to see if it had any different material on it. This DVD is based from her HBO special in Santa Rosa, CA in January 09. The material on this DVD and the show are virtually the same.....very raunchy and not for the faint hearted.
Lisa bills herself as an ""insult comic"" and she does manage to offend every minority and gay group out there. Lisa's hero is Howard Stern so if you decide to purchase this DVD, make sure there are no kids around when you watch it. It's not for everyone. With that said, if you like an insult comic, then Lisa doesn't disappoint. It's all in fun and she always acknowledges the good sports in the audience as she did in her show. I personally liked Lisa's live show and her interaction with the audience, but this DVD won't disappoint either.",1262390400,,886,4.441717791411043
