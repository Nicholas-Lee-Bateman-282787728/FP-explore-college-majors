8654210,5,B00JWS9GHO,"Have to say I throughly enjoyed this show for a few reasons...Yay for so many female characters with strong story lines... Women of ALL ages, portraying more depth and experience. The sad fact is that there are not too many female roles theses days, unless the actress is 20-30 and carrying on with the 50-60 year-old men. As a viewer, watching those kind of unrealistic relationships makes it very hard to identify with those one-dimensional characters. THIS show seems to capture the real-life challenges facing women of all ages and I can't wait to see more!!  We're just getting started.

Congratulations to the writers and producers, as well as the cast...Bring on Season 2! :)",1414627200,3,682,4.921739130434783
