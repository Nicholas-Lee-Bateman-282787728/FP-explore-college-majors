8665779,5,B00LGYNYY8,"Here is a DVD about two Russian Twin Boys, Kazik and Asik Aliev who survived one of the worst tragedies known around the world in 2005.  In Breslan, Russia, within 48 hours of the 1st day of school in September, 2005, Chechen rebels took the students and others hostage.  The Chechens claimed the bomb detonated by mistake leaving 344 hostages killed - among the dead were 172 children.  In this DVD, The Boys of Breslan, no commentary is necessary because from the point of view of Kazik and Asik, who are in 7th Grade the producer with brilliance portrayed the spirit and resilience of their youth to go forward in life.  One of the best episodes in the film is both boys return to School #1 for the first time after the massacre and show their reactions.  When one of the boys was requested to tell how he felt past, present, or future, he said ""I can't ..."" as tears appeared in his eyes - the most deeply moving part!  Although they spoke with deep sadness about that dark day in September, in other parts of the film there is the sparkle of hope in their eyes.  Any viewer would marvel at the bravery of both boys, especially as they spoke of hope and peace on earth for Russia and the world.  This is a five-star rating because ""The Boys of Breslan"" must be an immortal classic like those that
remind us of the Jewish Holocaust - both must never be forgotten!",1469750400,,1366,4.392857142857143

8665781,1,B00LGYNYY8,"There is no narration on this documentary, and very few words at all.  That might be okay if the film maker kept things interesting.  This is 47 minutes of footage of 2 boys who are survivors of the tragedy.  About a year later, the film maker records them over the span of one average day, from waking up until going to bed.  They are shown brushing thier teeth, making the bed, making tea, riding bikes.  They do visit their old school building briefly, just to walk around.  The film maker asks them what books they like, and to show him their cd player.  Thats about it  Cute kids going about their normal day and some footage of a bullet ridden former school.  If you want a documentary about this tragedy, I strongly suggest ""Three days in September.""",1435363200,,757,4.467153284671533
8665782,1,B00LGYNYY8,"This film is basically a day of two boys everyday life from when they wake up, play in the street and go to bed. Almost ten minutes of brushing their teeth in turn, another ten minutes when they bicycle around the street, a look around the premises of the school where the terrorists struck. One hour total.
I am very interested in Russian film, and this was about the least interesting film I ever saw... No interesting points raised, nothing really about the incident in Beslan- just close up film of the two surviving brothers in ver simple everyday situations.
Why make a film like this???? Not a documentary, not a good film, just 40 minutes of film of the two boys brushing their teeth, drinking tee, bicycling, visiting the school and going to bed.",1202428800,25,755,4.6
