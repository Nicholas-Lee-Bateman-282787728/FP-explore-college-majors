4670890,5,B003N3BQXG,"This is a rave review for the quality of production on this set of videos.  They are sharp and clear, lighting is just right, which is important since the Kojak was reminisant of film noire.  I intend to purchase Kojak , Season 4, and hope Shout Factory does the fifth season.  Could we convince them to make some other old tv classics available with their signature quality?  How about Maverick with James Garner and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp with Hugh O'Brian.",1336435200,3,470,4.559523809523809
4670891,5,B003N3BQXG,"I watched the whole third season. Print quality: excellent. The third season is better than the second. That is: it's great! Watch for Sly Stallone in an ambiguous/bad guy role. Jerry Orbach is great, too. It's like Gene Hackman's ""Conversation"" meeting Harvey Keitel's ""Copland."" And Telly rules!
PS The music is very good too. It would deserve a CD. Maybe a bonus, for season 5. I would pay extra money for it. Like what they did for M Squad.",1332720000,11,444,4.632911392405063
4670892,5,B003N3BQXG,"As a longtime Kojak fan ( while only 28 years old), I must say that the quality is as clear as Fiji Spring Water. Plus, Kojak showed from the tipoff of Season 3 that neither he or his team will rest until the case is solved. Whether, it has to do with his own family or cops in his department, Lt. Kojak displays not ONE ounce of fear! Lookout for a gripping episode with a young Sylvester Stallone. So after reading this, order Season 3. Uh, that means RIGHT NOW!!!!",1332288000,4,467,4.2
4670893,5,B003N3BQXG,"Glad to see season 3 going to DVD...Mr Salvalas played Kojack to a tee....Loved when he use to call his detective ""Fatso"" A no nonsense detective.. I can't imagine anyone playing Lt Kojack better then Mr Telly Savalas.",1327104000,9,218,4.7631578947368425

Whilst it is kind of an historic show now, it was contemporary when it was made - not only is it great as the show it was meant to be, but it's also insightful from a cultural perspective as to how New York was at that time.

4670932,5,B003N3BQXG,"Season Three opens strong right out of the gate with ""Questions & Answers"" (2 parts) and concludes with ""A Grave Too Soon."" 24 hard hitting episodes which include:  A savage murder of a priest, a car theft ring, an 18 year old homicide cold case, a cop killer and a mob hit on Kojak.

Here are my 5 reasons why Kojak will forever remain ONE of the best television detectives series of the 70s:

#1 Telly Savalas as Theo Kojak

He IS Kojak. The intelligence, charm and wit of Telly Savalas are irrepressible and inimitable. Savalas was a trendsetter. He takes his place in the pantheon of TV and Cinematic movie Detectives such as Humphrey Bogart. Clint Eastwood. Peter Falk.
Simply  Unforgettable.

#2 The Scripts/Stories

These are tight-as-a-drum, flawlessly well-written episodes indicative of cinema. Suspenseful, gritty crime writing with purpose and heart. Fantastic one-liners that are quote-worthy to this very day. Crime writer Joe Gores received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Episode in a TV Series Teleplay for the third-season episode ""No Immunity for Murder.""

#3 The Actors/Performances

C'mon...""fuggedaboutit,"" as the mobsters say... the whole cast: Kevin Dobson, Dan Frazer, George Savalas and the guest stars: Eli Wallach. F. Murray Abraham. Sylvester Stallone... the list goes on.
Great casting and credible performances.

#4 The Locations

New York in the 70s beautifully rendered on film in this series. Lots of WTC shots and inner cityscapes that convey the realism of detective work and Manhattan South. It feels very real like when Sidney Lumet<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Making-Movies/dp/0679756604/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Making Movies</a>&nbsp;shot in New York.

#5 Music/Scores

Memorable theme song (Billy Goldenberg, John Cacavas). Music throughout and through episodes is just the right touch of jazz and great compositions. When the final credits roll in each episode, it's film quality.

As a bonus on this set, there is a respectable and heartfelt documentary on Kojak and, most importantly the man who played him so well... Telly Savalas. Angie Dickinson and his close family fondly remember him as the great man he really was.",1345593600,9,2237,5.48396501457726
4670933,5,B003N3BQXG,"Telly Savalas was superb as Lt Theo Kojak, which he played for five seasons from 1973 - 1978, with a terrific supporting cast of actors in his squad room including Kevin Dobson as Crocker, his real-life brother George as Stavros, and Dan Frazer as the Captain/Chief.

Isn't it sad that the TV shows now are so poorly written, that people have to go back at least 20 years to find good TV entertainment. As for me, I miss the late night talk shows like Johny Carson.
