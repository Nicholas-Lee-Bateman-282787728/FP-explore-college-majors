8424254,5,B004CZZZVS,"Season 5 of this long-running program is set in 1990 and is the first not to feature Commissioner Corrado Cattani.  Viewers will recall Corrado was brutally gunned down by the Mafia in a surprise ambush at the end of Season 4.

Season 5 opens a few months after Corrado's murder. His lover, Judge Silvia Conti, is mourning his death, but determined to continue his war against the Mafia.  As Corrado lay dying, Silvia made a solemn promise to him to find and bring to justice all those responsible for his murder.

In terms of the 'good' guys (i.e. law enforcement), Corrado was overwhelmingly the focus of the previous seasons, however Season 5 is more of a team effort, comprising Silva and two faithful policemen, Inspectors Quadri and Trevi - viewers will quickly bond with these courageous, intelligent characters.  As a result, the Series has lost none of its appeal despite the loss of Corrado. This season the action moves back to the Mafia's heartland in Sicily, with less of the focus on Milan and Rome we saw in Seasons 3 and 4.

In Season 5, we finally see the forces of good start to break the tentacles of the Mafia - many viewers will be frustrated with how, in the previous seasons, the police and judiciary were constantly outwitted and defeated by the Mafia.  However law enforcement has come a long away since Corrado's naive methods of Season 1.  They've become smarter and more effective in the fight and this is the season where we see the Mafia get a real knock on the head.

The season explores a period of great change for the Mafia.  This was when it first entered the illegal drug trade in the 1970s. Prior to this time, the Mafia was a relatively benign organisation, however the enormous profits of the new drug trade made them greedy and ruthless and led to horrific internecine violence.

We're introduced to the Linori family of Sicily. Giovanni Linori set up a shipping and construction company called ""SicilTechnoPlus"" in Sicily around 1970 - the company did so well in the following years that many believed this was possible only through Mafia linked illegal activities. And this was indeed the case - Linori is involved in  arms and drug trafficking in Sicily, aided by (though not strictly part of) the Mafia.  Linori's son, Mimmo, is CEO of the company, however the Mafia want Linori to replace Mimmo with one of their own, a Mafioso by the name of Corso.  Linori refuses, and in revenge the Mafia murders Mimmo.  A bloody war ensues between Linori and Corso and their allies.

A parallel but related storyline looks at Dave Licata, a former policeman in Sicily who was part of a special squad investigating the Mafia related drug trade in Sicily in 1970.  Angered by this, the Mafia ordered all policemen in the squad murdered.  However, unknown to the Mafia, Dave manages to escape and flees to the U.S., but is forced to leave his wife and baby son behind in Italy.  Now living a reclusive life in New York, and not having seen his wife and son for 20 years, Dave gets news that Linori may have been involved in his squad's death and decides to return to Sicily to infiltrate the Linori household, posing as a bodyguard, and see what he can learn.

Meanwhile, Silva is in Sicily also on the heels of the Mafia, eager to get any information on who was behind Corrado's death.  She believes that Antonio Espinosa (the sinister villain whom we saw in Series 4) asked Linori to carry out the killing and is determined to bring Espinosa to justice.  In doing so, Silva teams up with Dave Licata and her colleagues Quadri and Trevi in their battle against the Mafia.  At the heart of Season 5 is a dark 20 year old mystery which goes to the very heart of the Mafia.  This Silva, Quadri and Trevi must uncover before it's too late.",1322870400,5,3766,4.6032934131736525
