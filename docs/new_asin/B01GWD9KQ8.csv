8764037,4,B01GWD9KQ8,"The late Dame Thora Hird leads the local parish of the Salvation Army. She is Captain Emily Ridley and with her two assistants Alice and Dorothy. They get into all sorts of situations. The series only lasted two seasons with fourteen episodes; the history of the Salvation Army and a Christmas Special.

If you love Dame Thora Hird, you will love seeing her play Captain Emily with Patsy Rowlands (Alice) and Rosamond Greenwood (Dorothy) in the cast. I thought Dorothy would be in the entire series but she is only in eight episodes of the fourteen episodes. Patsy and Thora lead the cast of this British series. I would have liked it if the DVD had special features like a tribute to the late great Dame Thora Hird OBE. She died at 93 years old and was working up until the end of her life. She even outlived her former-son-in-law Mel Torme. Dame Thora led an incredible life with grace, dignity and class.",1500076800,,907,4.564417177914111
