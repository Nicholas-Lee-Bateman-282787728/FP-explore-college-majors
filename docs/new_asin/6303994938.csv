756140,3,6303994938,"I am sold on FIRM videos, but i was disappointed in this one. It requires a lot of coordination, so you might not want to buy it if you're a beginner. Also, the workout requires a step, even though the outside  doesn't mention one. So I was pretty much stuck once I figured that out.  Overall I love the videos and was  disappointed to find one that didn't  live up to the others.",911692800,2,380,4.164383561643835

7858774,1,6303994938,"The item arrived three weeks after I placed the order, ok. It is supposed to be a brand new tape, but it shuts down the vcr or ejects the tape, it does not play. Very frustrating.",1354579200,,179,4.0
7858775,5,6303994938,"Ha! I love this! Here's the thing:  It's only tough if you haven't done any other videos by The FIRM.  Otherwise, if you have done a full hour routine, then yes- this one is ""Not So Tough"". =)
I like the quick breaks inbetween workout transitions because I can switch weights or drink water. Overall, very good short work out! I def rec trying the full on workouts if you want a challenge!",1341273600,,389,4.315068493150685
7858776,5,6303994938,"This is a tape that really gets the heart pumping. It is very easy to follow,but it is a challenge. It is fun challenging aeribics segments about 40 minutes in all. It is compiled from the 6 original frim volumes so you get all the original instructers Janet Gretzky,Sandahl Bergman,Susan Harris,etc.

  It asks for dumbells about 3-7 pounds and a aeobic step about 6-10 inches. This a really good workout for when your short on time but want to get a great sweat. I think it is really good for beginners,they just need to use light weights and short steps. It is also good for advance they can heavy up on the weights and use the higher aerobic boxes.

  It is a great workout from the firm. It is a great cardio combo that is good for beginners to advance. This is another one of my favorites from the Firm.",1151366400,3,809,4.36
7858777,4,6303994938,"""The Firm Parts: Not-So Tough Aerobics"" is a combination of step aeorbics and standing floor moves, some with weights and some without.  This tape was edited from about half a dozen earlier ""The Firm"" workout tapes -- 7 minutes here, 3 minutes there -- like one of those serial TV shows that shows bits & pieces from previous shows.  The lady pictured on the cover fills in transitions between segments, telling you what equipment to get and how to stand to get ready for the next segment.

Contrary the title, ""Not-So Tough Aerobics"" is a fairly challenging aerobic workout.  Unlike most Firm workout tapes, this exercise session only uses light weights (3 to 5 lbs) and a low step (3"" to 7"").  So it is suitable for days between weightlifting sessions.  The exercises are all low impact.  This tape can be modified into a beginner workout by stopping early.

In my opinion, the biggiest problem with this workout tape is that the edits are disruptive.  The visual transitions from set to set give the exercise session a ""cheap"" feel.  Still, the overall workout is worthwhile.

This workout has background music that is enjoyable and varied.  Visually, the workout quite entertaining:  colorful backdrop, statues, murrals on the wall, and a variety of people exercising in different clothing.  It looks like you are in a class with many other people.",1134604800,7,1352,4.87280701754386
7858778,4,6303994938,"This is a really good workout.  There are lots of variations, working with weights & a step.  The only awkward thing is the warm-up at the beginning of the video.  It's very fast-paced & the instructor doesn't explain where she's going.  I just do my own warm-up & start with the aerobics. Also, there are intervals between each workout segment, so there is a few seconds to rest in between.  A good workout overall.",1043712000,7,416,4.5675675675675675
7858779,3,6303994938,"Great workout but the ""not so tough"" is ""not so true"" you can get a great workout here but if you are a beginner or getting back to exercise after not working out for a while don't start here.",970444800,13,192,3.948717948717949
