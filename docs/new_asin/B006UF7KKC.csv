I had to come back and state this.  I just watched the entire show from beginning to end - again - and these 2012 Episodes are the best (after the ""White Box"" special.) You won't be disappointed!  These are MUST SEE if you like the show :)  PS: I promise you'll be GAGGING on Eddie's fashion--Ohmazing!!!!!",1483315200,,364,4.388059701492537
