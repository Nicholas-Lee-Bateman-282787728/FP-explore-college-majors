8290362,4,B001CY5KRG,"The advantage of this DVD/TV program is the experts are recognized experts that have significant background experience and present it clearly and professionally.  The only disadvantage for me was the host reminded me of the TV football color commentators, they have to say something just to be saying something!  The host felt it was necessary to repeat or rephrase much of what the expert had just said.",1362441600,,404,5.014925373134329
8290363,4,B001CY5KRG,"The show was interesting from looking at the DVD's. I didn't get the show where I live. I thought from all the reviews I had heard about it, it would be something that I would learn from and enjoy. I was not that impressed. It did have a lot of different things they talked about, so you have a choice to watch the whole thing or take a break and then come back and watch more. However it was worth what I paid for it.",1355184000,,418,3.929411764705882
8290364,5,B001CY5KRG,"This DVD set contains 4 discs ! Each disc contains 4 episodes which are 15-30 mins in length. The material presented in priceless. This is the stuff they teach you in those expensive tactical firearm classes.  Yes, you still need to actually practice out in the field to become proficient. But watching these videos over and over really etches into your brain the ""what if's"" when it comes to defensive shooting.  I really loved this series...it is EXCELLENT. I cannot give more accolades to this truly informative, realistic and well-produced TV series. Too bad they cancelled it...but thank Amazon for having it on DVD. Truly awesome stuff.",1345420800,,642,4.990654205607477

1 of PERSONAL DEFENSE TV 2006 Season DVD 4 Disc Set [ASIN: B001CY5KRG

DVD's are professional produced, Very good, easy to understand techniques of handguns are taught. Great for beginners especially,if you have never touched a gun before this is good stuff. Gun choices, how to carry, draw, carry concealed, presentation, ammunition, self defense. Safety, safety, safety.
But these skills have to practiced on a shooting range to ever hope to actually acquire the skill.
The 2008 and 2009  DVD sets are excellent as well.
