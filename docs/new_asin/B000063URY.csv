Colonel of a Special Service Unit to hit the D-Day beaches in advance of the enormous amphibious landing on that fateful day in Normandy...getting back to O'Brien's character which adds much to the military aspects of a egotistic loud/mouth and always looking for a headline that mortal combat is his rite of passage for his existence...his bedraggled/return to a safe harbor after the debacle at Dieppe was totally real...in a horse blanket for clothes and walking like he was on eggs/shells with that eternal thousand yard stare on his stunned kisser for having been blown out of his craft into the drink where he felt every German gunner was doing their utmost just to kill his lame-butt...he never got to the enemy shore!!....that's classic combat, I kid you naught...there are a zillion sweet romantic moments when Taylor can't get enough of Wynter [a torrid mutual cohabitation] is enchanting, yes,and even an enduring love... it is wartime England as bombs/rockets rain down on most of the port cities facing France...one must understand the frailty of human emotions to cram all the love and what it means to be love before one dies suddenly...which, is very heady existence, that only here and now is all that matters is conveyed so wonderful between Taylor and Wynter...even the officer: who Jerry Paris portrays is done extremely well as the cocktail/partying soldier who lives from one gin party/dance to another without any unpatriotic guilt whatsoever...I loved all the subplots that makeup how it was before D-Day and the GIs who were destined to be at this juncture of history...don't judge the lack of morals here unless you were ""actually blown out of the water twice"" ...darn good show of war and what it can do to soldier and citizens alike under fire.....Semper Fi....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF",1180137600,2,2448,5.1225
1697581,2,B000063URY,"For the first five minutes I thought that this was going to be one of the best war movies I'd ever see, but then suddenly the movie back tracks to the years preceeding the D-Day invasion to document the love triangle that developed between a gorgeous woman and two of the officers in the commando unit.  This lasts for much of the rest of the movie, with only five or ten minutes in the end consisting of a reasonably decent combat sequence.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of infidelity being masked as ""romance,"" which made the movie all the more annoying to watch.  This should simply not be considered a ""war movie"" or a ""classic"".",1170028800,,635,4.456896551724138
1697582,2,B000063URY,"You've got to feel a little sad for Dana in this one. Her American lover went home to his wife; her English lover trod on a bomb; and her father shot himself. Well, that's life I guess. There is some interest, but not a lot, in trying to figure out along the way how the story is going to get wrapped up. On the marginally plus side, it seems a fairly accurate depiction of how the war panned out for some women in Britain; and it captures something of the atmosphere on the home front. Not much about the action on the other front. I suppose most of the audience were pleased it hadn't happened to them.",1128211200,3,604,4.170940170940171
1697583,5,B000063URY,"I read many of the other reviews and I understand many thought the name is misleading and maybe is somewhat so, but that doesn't detract from the spectacular performances by Robert Taylor and Dana Wynter.  What's so amazing is they capture perfectly and insightfully portray what it was like to experience the fear and lonliness many experienced in World War II.  In all their emotional complexities of being away from home and family (Robert Taylor) or that of a loved one being off to war (Dana Wynters), these two heroes begin by finding comfort in their friendship.  As time progresses and the pain of war begins taking it's toll on them, they find solace in each others arms.  This romance is worthy of the classic movies like Casablanca and From here to Eternity where the same dilemma plagued Ingrid Bergman",1117238400,8,814,4.792857142857143
1697584,1,B000063URY,"Yes, the title ""D-Day the Sixth of June"" is irritatingly  misleading.  This movie spends most of its time chronicling the tawdry tale of a married U.S. military officer who has an affair with a British USO-type woman who is engaged to be married to a courageous British officer.  The battle scenes are sporadic, and the story creaks along slowly.  The handsome Robert Taylor and the beautiful Dana Wynter are basically wasted because their roles are so unsympathetic.  The characters that they portray have few qualms about cheating on their loved ones.
The movie also is not helped by a repetitious, sappy musical score that includes the sentimental song ""You'll Never Know (How Much I Love You)"" which accompanies the illicit lovers as they unapologetically indulge in their affair.
""D-Day the Sixth of June"" is strictly for diehard fans of Taylor or Wynter. And perhaps not even those fans will be able to swallow this drivel.",1054944000,8,929,4.967741935483871
1697585,1,B000063URY,"Michael Bay must have studied this film before he made his own execrable ""Pearl Harbor.""  In both cases, the filmmakers cynically titled their product after a famous WWII battle although they were really more interested in developing a dull, cliched love triangle than honestly confronting and exploring the meaning, experience, and drama of a significant historical event.  At least, Bay relieved the tedium with some action.  ""D-Day"" director Henry Koster doesn't address the actual invasion until the final ten minutes or so of this overlong film, and by then it is far too little far too late.  Robert Taylor, Dana Wynter, and Richard Todd deliver their performances with all the animation of store-front mannequins.  Taylor is far too old for this role, but Wynter, at least, is very nice to look at.",1047772800,14,805,5.068181818181818
1697586,2,B000063URY,"Disapointing. I was looking forward to a good action movie, but most of the movie is a love story, and the movie only gets to D-Day at the very end. The title is misleading.",1029456000,7,173,4.117647058823529
1697587,2,B000063URY,"The title of this movie is deceptive advertising, the war is a backdrop to a very predictable love triangle. There is about 15 minutes of decent action which recreates (but does not credit)the Point du Hoc battle. Robert Tayor is sincere but 10 years to old to be a Captain leading troops in 1946. Dana Wynter is pretty enough to inspire two manly suitors but oddly doesn't seem to have any real passionate feelings for either. The brit commando third of this triangle is likable but out of the picture for all but a few minutes at the beginning and at the end. In short, a chic flic spun with a not very compelling tried and true wartime love triangle. Solid actors try but fail with mediocre material.",1026259200,12,703,4.5
1697588,3,B000063URY,"If you're expecting anything like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Longest Day,"" you've come to the wrong film. This film focuses primarily on the love interests of Todd and Taylor for Dana Wynter  (a rather lovely Dana at That). The second world war focuses primarily as a  backdrop.
The film takes place in England and the English are stereotyped  as American loathers and ingrates. This is admittedly hard for the viewer  to stomach. We are also treated to a mundane script which doesn't give the  good ol' boys (Richard Todd, Robert Taylor, Jerry Paris) much to chew  on.
The film redeems itself somewhat in the end with an excellent  although short pre-invasion landing on one of Normandy's beaches by  American and British troops. The battle sequences are effective and very  convincing as the group attempts to knock out a bunker complex.
In true  Hollywood fashion, the film concludes with Dana Wynter fading into the  sunset, having lost both her loves, one at the Normandy landing, the other  through mutual self-righteousness. There's nothing to sink your teeth into  here, but if you like candy coated versions of war, this is a good place to  start.",955584000,16,1159,4.907216494845361

1697620,1,B000063URY,"If this were even a reasonable romance drama it might be alright but it is so trite and predictable and then just throws the whole thing away. The message probably was more relevant to those who lived through the war, that everyone suffers, but I don't think that you or I today needed to suffer through this movie just to feel the same thing.

The movie has absolutely nothing to do with D-Day in any real way. It sneaks into the plot but only for a few minutes and what takes place could have been anywhere and anytime in the war. This is not a war drama, it is a romantic triangle.",1466812800,,584,4.214285714285714

1697643,4,B000063URY,"Viewers who want an all out action war movie with guns blazing and corpse strewn landscapes should avoid D-Day the Sixth of June.  Released in 1956, the film looks back somewhat nostalgically at a war that was already beginning to fade into history. The world depicted seems remote as few people today have actually experienced total war. Today War World II has taken its place in history as the necessary war, the unquestioned war, unlike most of what has happened since--Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan.

The movie explores large issues on a small scale.  We follow a few individuals and how their lives were impacted by the events preceding the Normandy invasion.  There is an elderly British Brigadier who has been left behind by modern warfare, a car salesman from Minneapolis who wants to be a general, a publisher's son-in-law invalided into a desk job, a British career soldier and a young woman from a sheltered background doing her part in the conflict.

The movie covers a number of themes including British American relations in the last year of the war, the dislocation of normal morality in wartime, the war-weariness of the British population as they hold out for yet another year of suffering.  Behind all of it is the war, huge, bloodthirsty and seemingly endless.  Everything is impacted--steaks are horse meat, cigarettes are a rarity, nights are pitch black with all light forbidden, sirens blare day and night.

The protagonists are Captain Brad Parker (Robert Taylor), an American who broke his leg on a parachute jump and has been relegated to desk work, Major John Wynter, a heroic British commando (actual war hero Richard Todd) and Valerie Russell (Dana Wynter), the young woman who comes to love them both.  Supporting characters include Major Timmons a volatile car salesman (Edmund O'Brien) and Brigadier Russell (John Williams), Valerie's father who is filled with bitterness over the end of his career.

Parker is a married man from New England who has been away from his wife for over three years.  Wynter and Valerie Russell are friends but not quite lovers.  When Wynter is posted to Africa, Parker and Russell remain in London and become friends and then lovers.  She is torn between her feelings of friendship and obligation towards Wynter and her exciting new American lover.

Eventually both Parker and Wynter become part of the Normandy invasion.  The last fifteen minutes or so of the movie concern the battle itself which seems tame by modern standards.  The lives of both men are changed forever by the events of June 6, 1944.  There is no happy ending for most of the characters, no neat solutions to the complications of human life against the background of death.

There are overtones of Waterloo Bridge (1940) in D-Day the Sixth of June.  A romance between two very different people against the backdrop of war is central in both films.  Robert Taylor is the male lead in both, wearing his signature trench coat each time.  Neither has a happy ending.  But there is an innocence to the earlier film that has been replaced by a kind of exhaustion in the latter.  Most of the main characters spend most of their time living in a phoney world where hedonism is the rule.  A character at one point speculates about what they'll all be doing after the war.  ""Going back to our husbands and wives,"" another replies.

D-Day the Sixth of June is well acted and has good production values.  Robert Taylor and Dana Wynter are compatible and their clinches are convincing.  Most of the time Taylor convinces us that he is younger than his actual years. His movements are those of a man younger than 45. Richard Todd is the good guy, loyal and self-sacrificing. Edmund O'Brien is outstanding as the volatile Col. Timmons.  The supporting cast is first rate.  D-Day the Sixth of June is a thoughtful film, looking back at a crucial part of what was then recent history.  Even at a distance of almost 60 years, the human dilemmas portrayed here are relevant and timely.",1380672000,2,4013,4.840175953079179
1697644,1,B000063URY,"This is not a war story, its a love story. I was really disappointed. I thought it would be somewhat like the ' The Longest Day""

1697645,2,B000063URY,I really thought this movie was only fair. The plot was more on a love scene instead of the invasion. The action part was OK but 80 percent of the movie was love scenes and the ending was just a let down.,1371686400,,204,3.880952380952381
1697646,3,B000063URY,"This movie spent all of 8 minutes on the beaches of Normandy.  The entire film massaged the audience with a love story.  There are plenty of great D-Day movies...here are three (My favorite is listed first...down to my least favorite of the three):

 1) ""Band of Brothers"" (2001)
 2) ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)

1697681,2,B000063URY,"This movie is 1 hour and 46 minutes long. There is about 15 minutes of war footage related to D-Day.  The other 1 hour and 30 minutes consist of 2 flashbacks by 2 soldiers.  The flashbacks have to do with the woman they love.  Each man is in love with the same woman, and the two men know each other.

I wouldn't call this a war movie. I would call it a drama/love story with a war theme on the side.

When I read the movie description, I was uncertain about it.  Since there was no way to tell how much ""love story"" there was, or how much war footage there would be, I decided to give it a chance.  Instead of sitting through the love story, I fast forwarded through it, and I'm really glad I did. It saved a bunch of time, which I was able to use for other stuff.

Try renting it before buying it, unless you like 85% drama/love story and only 15% war footage, which I don't.

1697682,4,B000063URY,"It was a good drama about what could have happened during the buildup and eventual invasion of France. I had hoped for a better ending, but that was the way things happened back then.",1356912000,,183,4.411764705882353
1697683,5,B000063URY,"I was myself surprised how much I liked this film. I expected an average war film with an average love story, both made in 50s style - and what I discovered was in fact a bitter-sweet war time romance, with the war itself being just a (rather well done) background to the story of a star-crossed love triangle...

Robert Taylor is excellent in this film, although at 45 he was maybe a little bit too old to play a young American captain just recently discharged from the airborne troops because of a serious injury in training. His character, Captain Brad Parker, is supposed to be still a young man, happily married since some time but as yet not having children. As he was affected to US Army Headquarters in London he left his wife behind in USA. I always liked Robert Taylor (""Quo Vadis"", ""Quentin Durward"", ""The knights of the round table"") and in this film too his talent made me forget pretty quickly that the actor is maybe a little bit too mature for such a role...

But the real star of this film is the lovely and talented Dana Wynter, who in 1956 was at the summit of her career, after having just played the role of her life in Don Siegel's ""Invasion of the body snatchers"". In this film she is stunningly beautiful and her character, a young British lady Valerie Russell, is simply charming! Valerie is very intelligent, very well spoken, very distinguished but also in the same time quite adventurous and almost totally fearless. And she is a complexe person - she says at one moment in this film ""You see me as an angel - but I am really not..."" - and this is a great scene.

Valerie is more or less engaged to a distinguished young British gentleman John Wynter (this film being based on a novel, the coincidence of names of this character with the name of the actress playing Valerie was completely accidental...), who is a captain (later lieutenant-colonel) in British Commandos. John Wynter is played by British actor Richard Todd, who incidentally really took part in the D-Day, jumping other Normandy with his fellow British paratroopers... This character is particularly likeable and quite impresive - a genuine leader of warriors and killer of enemy warriors, who in the same time is a very decent, gentle and a rather shy man in private life.

But well, life is complicated, love is complicated and people are complicated. And by separating people for long periods of time and reminding them constantly how fragile and short is human life, war complicates things even more... And therefore Brad, Valerie and John (and Brad's wife, whom we never see, but who is very much present nevertheless) will find themselves in the middle of a very complexe equation, which will find its solution, in one way or another, on the D-Day, when both Brad and John will participate in the invasion. As if things were not already enough complicated, Brad will fight that day under John's orders...

I will not tell you any more details about the story and I would advise against searching for them before watching this film. The final solution is, in my modest opinion, the best the scenarist could find and it is important to ignore it, as it is revealed only at the very last minute. The love story or rather love stories are very touching and wonderful. The lack of scrupules with which some characters are ready to betray the trust of their loved ones, combined with the charm of a newly born love are an interesting combination and in this aspect this film is NOT completely faithful (pun very much intentional) to the style of the 50s.

Sideshow elements are also pretty good. Valerie's father, an aging general who watches powerless as the country he once knew and still loves is changed both by the war and the arrival of powerful and wealthy Americans, is a particularly tragic character. And Brad's superior, overambitious colonel Timmer, who absolutely wants to make general before the end of war gives to this film some delicious comic moments.

I really liked this film a lot and I spend a very pleasant evening watching it. It is not maybe a masterpiece, but I had such a good time watching it, that I simply can not give it less than five stars. Enjoy!",1349913600,,4174,4.655359565807327
1697684,4,B000063URY,"The title ""D-Day the Sixth of June"" is somewhat misleading in that this movie doesn't center on D-Day.  There is indeed a battle near the ending of the movie that involves a joint Anglo-American raid on a German position that precedes the main landing.  The main theme in this movie centers on a war-time romance in London between an American officer (Robert Taylor) and a lonely English wife (Dana Wynter).  Their meeting begins innocently; however, war-time circumstances, i.e., he is away from home and wife and her husband is a high ranking officer that is heavily engaged in fighting battles. The friendly ""dates"" evolve into to affection then into a love affair.

While all this is proceeding the American officer (Edmond O'Brien) that was to lead the joint operation cited above becomes incapacitated and has to be replaced.  The new leader an English Colonel is the husband (Richard Todd) who has figured out his wife has been involved with the American Captain (Robert Taylor) who will be his second in command during the raid.

How this plot unfolds is the crux of the movie. I will not divulge the ending other than to say only one of the married couples will have a happy reunion.",1332028800,,1192,4.790243902439024

1697686,3,B000063URY,"The title of this movie is pretty misleading as it will almost certainly lead the unwary  prospective purchaser to expect a combat heavy picture ,one with a focus on the actual Normandy landings .Instaed they will find themselves confronted with a picture whose combat scenes are all in the last 20 minutes ,and brief (but ,it should be acknowledged,well staged ).Instead the viewer will get an ""eternal triangle""story set largely in World War Two London .It takes place from 1942  -to 1944 and revolves around the growing attraction between US Army Captain,Brad Parker (Robert Taylor) and ""Enlish rose""type  Valerie  (Dana Wynter )whose father ,the  retired  Bridagier  Russell ( John Williams) is vitriolic in his contempt for the American troops stationed in his village .Despite his opposition Valerie and Brad fall in love but anotherv problem lies in wait .She is unofficially engaged to a serving British soldier ,John Wynter (Richard Todd )who is serving with the eighth Army in North Africa and whose return brings matters to a head .

A subplot revolves around Parker's boss in London ,the loose cannon and fiercely ambitious Colonel Timms (Edmond O'Brien ) who cannot wait to get into action and who has a chip on his shoulder about not being a West Pointer

It is decently acted ,especially by O'Brien and Todd ,and boasts some warm ,natural looking colour but the script lacks suprises and the movie meanders to its conclusion without ever fully engrossing the viewer .As a war movie it is negligible but passes muster as a soap opera .",1255478400,,1549,4.94980694980695
1697687,3,B000063URY,"This 1956 effort is pure production line stuff given a CinemaScope and Stereophonic gloss, with the emphasis on romantic, rather than military, manoeuvres. Robert Taylor (understandably) loves Dana Wynter, who also (not so understandably) loves Richard Todd; Edmond O'Brien loves glory; and John Williams just hangs around the sidelines of both plot and frame as the quintessential old-world fogey. After much talk, guilt and plot contrivances, O'Brien loses his nerve, Taylor loses the girl and Todd loses even more. Waterloo Bridge it ain't.

Very much an American take on the invasion (although in fact it deals primarily with a diversionary raid), Taylor's arrogance and the screenplay's clumsy culture clashes do give off an unfortunate aura of seeing the British as a bunch of ingrates who couldn't tie their shoelaces without help from the Yanks that is less than endearing. Sample dialogue: ""I don't go for them Limeys. They talk fast, but fight slow."" The Home Guard too are singled out for contempt. The very few other British to make it into the film are of the ""Cor, luvaduck guv'nor"" variety, although, to be fair, even fewer Germans are on view - while not exactly a cheapie, the budget obviously didn't extend to more than five German uniforms.

Despite director Henry Koster's limited visual imagination - if there are three people in any given shot, you can bet he'll line them up left, right and centre without fail - and a total absence of close-ups so prevalent in early widescreen pictures, the old-fashioned CinemaScope is a virtue and one of the chief reasons for buying this: with little in the way of battle scenes and much mushy stuff, this is more one for undemanding romantics and readers of Harlequin  romances than the Boys Own brigade.",1232496000,3,1766,5.0

7960118,5,B000063URY,"This is one of my favorite Robert Taylor movies. It takes place in England during World War II before the invasion of Normandy, D-Day. The storyline is believable where Robert Taylor's character, on a chance meeting, is introduced to the Female lead actor. The two begin a friendship that soon turns into more. The basic story is not new but well worth the watch! Also, the Battle scenes were realistic. I thoroughly suggest this movie if you want to watch an old war movie with more.",1503532800,,484,4.6395348837209305

Pat lives with my grandmother in a care facility and they both share waning memories. However, she fondly remembers acting in this movie and shares the glory days of working at Twentieth Century Fox. She is sweet and always smiles. I'm posting this as tribute to her remarkable life and to immortalize her on the interwebs.",1486771200,2,449,4.69620253164557
