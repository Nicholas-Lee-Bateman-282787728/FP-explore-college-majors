2252698,5,B0007YMWGY,"I remember watching Baa Baa Black Sheep when I was a kid and then rediscovering it on the History Channel.  I LOVED IT!

It is the stories of the famed WWII Marine Corp fighter squadron VFM-214 better know as the ""Black Sheep"".  The series follows the exploits of this unit in the air and on the ground.  The acting is quite good, as is the chemistry among the actors.  The combat scenes combine new footage and some actual combat footage from the war.  This does look a bit awkward at times but I never found to be that big of an issue.  It is very fun viewing and quite family friendly.

Robert Conrad is perfect in his depiction of the hard living, hard drinking commander of the outfit Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington.  Among the series regulars were a very young John Larroquette and Red West, former bodyguard for Elvis Presley.  You will doubtless recognize other faces in the cast as many became staples in 80's TV and some can still be seen today.

Watch for the actual Greg Boyington making a cameo as he pins a medal on Conrad in one of the episodes.

Good to see this come back!",1113782400,51,1081,4.376884422110553

I remember watching this as a kid, and liked it.  Now, as an adult, I recently read 'Pappy Boyington's' autobiography, which made me want to go back and watch the series.  While it certainly goes off on it's own, not staying strictly with the book, I think I actually appreciate 'Pappy's' character more, having read the book.",1488672000,2,476,4.564705882352941

The only, and i stress only, problem is with Vol. 1, Disc 1, Side A. The second episode will not play at all. I have tried several DVD players, Blu-Ray players and computers to no avail. I requested a replacement for the product and received it quickly. However, the same problem exists. I get a bit farther and closer to playing the second episode, but still no go. Ugh. Everything else is great. I have purchased volume 2 and even the full season 2 and i am very happy. Just not quite sure what to do about this one episode.",1474588800,5,702,4.246268656716418

Robert Conrad is perfect for the leading role (Dare you to knock that battery off his shoulder!) but the episodes featuring Red West (You college boys better not mess up my planes!"") were the most memorable.

2252760,2,B0007YMWGY,"Loved the show in the seventies and it was still enjoyable, but one episode on disk 2 side 1 would not play smoothly. It kept freezing and skipping in approximately the same spots, and no level of fast forwarding, reversing, scene jumping etc would allow me to watch even half the episide. Reading some of the other reviews I see that others had a similar experience. It's odd that whomever authored the disk did not more evenly fill the two sides of disk 2, as four episides were crammed on side 1, and two episodes plus the short extra were put on side 2. I'm guessing that had something to do with the issue but I can't be sure. It's a shame because the affected episode was one that I remembered well and was one of my favorites. I will return for a replacement in hopes that I do better with a different set, but if it is indeed an authoring issue I shouldn't be too hopeful that a different set will play better.",1464998400,2,918,4.281609195402299

2252786,5,B0007YMWGY,"I gave this 5 stars for the pure entertainment value and boyhood nostalgia.  I watched this as an early teenager and loved WWII history and geography.  One of the clues that I got back then that it was a little inaccurate is that when I went to my map to find Vella La Cava, there was no such place (I'm not really such a nerd, I just didn't have an xBox, or Playstation, or Nintendo so all I had to do was read and study maps...and play outside!)  Anyway, even though it is horribly inaccurate as far as history goes, it is hugely entertaining.  Where else could you get to see one of the coolest planes every week on TV? The F4U CORSAIR!!  Robert Conrad is over the top, but we wouldn't have him any other way.  We also couldn't live without the nurses that was frequently and conveniently on several episodes.  That could be another reason that a thirteen year old would be glued to the screen every time this came on the air.  For another cool WWII plane, I would like to recommend the documentary ""Thunderbolt"" that features the P-47 ""Jug"" in all of its glory in the ETO.  There are some great documentaries in the ""Dogfights"" series on the P-51 Mustang, P-61 Black Widow, and the F6F Hellcat.  I don't know too many WWII aircraft that are NOT cool!!!  If you watch Baa Baa Black Sheep, don't use it to teach your kids about the career of Boyington or too much about WWII history.  Just watch it for the pure enjoyment.  Be sure to read his book for the facts.",1443484800,,1465,4.322344322344322

2252839,3,B0007YMWGY,"The show is phenomenally good. It's a great story. It's well told. And it's full of WWII Corsairs. That's a recipe for great television.

The problem lies in the DVDs themselves. I went through 3 copies of this set and all 3 had a manufacturing error that rendered several of the episodes unwatchable. Even looking at the discs you could see an error as the plastic casing around the optical reflector was wavy and bubbly. This causes dispersion of the laser which makes the disc useless.

If it wasn't for that this would be a 5 star item because the show is fantastic! But that problem makes the DVD set useless if you get a bad one.",1419292800,,635,4.418803418803419

2252859,4,B0007YMWGY,"This was one of Robert Conrad's better shows that never really found an audience large enough to sustain it past two years.  They changed the title to ""Black Sheep Squadron""  for the second season (good idea) but then scheduled it opposite Charlie's Angels (bad idea).  The supporting characters were good as were the aerial sequences and the production.  Had the show been given more of a chance it probably would have lasted several years.",1403827200,,441,4.918918918918919

This series was done back when TV was still doing shows that involved WWII weekly. The other great shows were Combat, 12 O'clock High, Rat Patrol, etc. IMO better quality and more entertaining than some of the major TV programming that society wants now or is forced to watch filled with social agendas, infomercials and stupid ""reality"" programming!  A breath of old school - hard hitting entertainment.",1403308800,,567,5.0212765957446805

2252896,5,B0007YMWGY,thumbs up on this series a great watch for anyone who is into our history and the stories from Pappy.,1374710400,,101,4.1
2252897,4,B0007YMWGY,"Here we have a one-of-a-kind WWII action/drama series for TV. Think 80 percent ""12 O'Clock High"" and 20 percent ""McHale's Navy"".

BBBS was a quasi-spoof of the real-life USMC Corsair fighter squadron VMF-214 ""Black Sheep"", active in the South Pacific Solomons island chain following its formation in August 1943. Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington (real person) commanded the unit from its inception until he was downed on January 3, 1944.

Beyond these facts, the show is almost entirely fictional. There have been complaints about the writers having taken liberties with the history of the real VMF-214 squadron. However, I think most all viewers are adult enough to realize that this is a television show produced in Hollywood as FICTION. The fact also is that Colonel Boyington himself participated in the show in three capacities: 1) as a technical advisor 2) with two cameo appearances 3) as spokesperson for the show's publicity campaign. If the show was good enough for Pappy, then it's good enough for me! So long as one considers it as pure television entertainment, it's hours and hours of fun.  A bit campy at times, but generally written with depth of significance and plausible plots and character motivations. There was nothing else like it. It was made by veteran TV producer Stephen Cannell.

Themes touched on throughout the episodes lend verisimilitude to the motivations and concerns of men at war. This show is no A-Team or Airwolf. The viewer is constantly reminded that the characters are in grave danger of being shot or blown up in a war theater thousands of miles distant from their homes. Many episodes feature guest-star ""gloryhound"" type characters who take an opportunistic interest in the war in furtherance of their own careers; and Pappy always sets them straight in the end that his primary concern is getting his men home from the war alive. Another realistic aspect of the scripts is the repeated emphasis on the squadron's supply and maintenance situation. The tensions between the pilots and the mechanics section drive a good many of the plots.

The cinematography approaches the astounding in most parts, especially considering it was filmed in 1976-78. There is no CGI here. Each show features REAL vintage Corsair aircraft loaned out specially for shooting (with cameras, this is!). Also to be seen are actual B-17s, B-25s, and P-38s. From time to time a quick ground shot of a Wildcat or Helldiver can be seen. The pilot featured a P-40 Warhawk, the aircraft Boyington flew with his time in the Flying Tigers in prewar China.

The combat footage is remarkable for its time. According to Wikipedia, this was the first time ever that a helmet-mounted camera was used to film in-cockpit footage from single-seat aircraft. Many of the aerial scenes are rendered in stunning form.

As for the Japanese aircraft, it is a sad fact that none survived the war. Therefore, modified SNJ trainers were modified and given Jap paintjobs. This is how all WWII movies have been made. Some combat footage from the war -- mostly gun camera footage -- is used in the show, but only footage shot in color (not much of that to be found).

All in all, Baa Baa Black Sheep is a spectacular must-have for your DVD collection.",1374364800,2,3241,4.944852941176471

2252904,5,B0007YMWGY,"This was a great show, its too bad they only made 2 seasons.
On a side note...in the early 90's, every now & then I would bump into a former ""Black Sheep"", who belonged to a motorcycle club for seniors.  He had his Harley painted to look like his corsair, including the amount of planes he shot down during WWII.  He liked the show (obviously), but he liked that all of us knew about the Black Sheep because of it even more.  He said he could never figure though, how someone would ever think that they were living it up with a bunch of Nurses on the beach every night...but I doubt he would have complained if they had really been there!!",1368576000,,639,4.221311475409836

There are aircraft carrier landings, dogfights, and great stunt flying. The dogfights are a combination of stock/vintage footage, live flying, and pretty realistic studio mockup simulations. Pappy and the Black Sheep are well played by Bob Conrad and a wonderful ensemble cast. (Even the nurses' hairstyles are more historically accurate than is usually the case during the 1970s!)",1368144000,,798,5.443548387096774

With Stephen J. Cannell at the helm what else could it be?  The series had the approval and blessing of the real principle character, Gregory Boyington but then again he received criticism from his contemporaries for painting them as goofballs and screw ups rather than accomplished marine aviators.  So if you're looking for historical accuracy you can probably forget it.  What you will get is hours of entertaining stories that are plausible enough for your grandpa to say ""Yea, that's just the way it happened.""  Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy.

I'm not sure how many of the events are true but it is based on a true American hero. My only complaint is that it's not a full season but has a high price.

2252944,5,B0007YMWGY,"I loved this show when it came out in '76, and so did my parents.  If a 17 year old can watch something with her parents, it's got to be a good show.
For anyone who says it wasn't really like that - no, because the show was too clean - most of the time in real life they didn't have uniforms or equipment in even 50% working order, and the cast was too healthy looking.  Everyone in the Pacific lost a quarter of their body weight from the humidity, heat and malaria.  But no one would have watched the show if the cast looked sickly.
My parents were teenagers when WWII began and my dad joined the Navy.  He was a gunner's mate on an aircraft carrier and served in the Pacific.  This was the only show or movie about WWII he would ever watch, including anything with John Wayne (although he like the Duke's westerns).
Daddy said Baa Baa Black Sheep showed what it was really like, people transferring in and out all the time, people getting hurt and killed, and, rules getting broken, sometimes because the old rules didn't work in a new world anymore.
I know these men were sons, husbands, brothers, and fathers to everyone here at home, but they were a long way from home, many for the first time in their lives, and most were very young, experiencing things they had never even heard of, or expected to know about, good and bad.

Back in the '70s, I used to love this program.  But from the day it went off the air, I slowly began to realize that is was completely fabricated.  Except for a pilot named Pappy Boyington and a Marine Squadron 214, everything about this show was not only made up, but a complete farce, featuring drunks with a complete lack of discipline who somehow manage to defeat the enemy.  Knowing all of this, I bought this DVD anyway, but I just can't bring myself to watch it again and again.  Time to move on.  I donated it to a Church yard sale and it didn't even sell there!

It is ostensibly the story of Maj. Greg Boyington and the formation and tour of duty of VMF-214, The Black Sheep Squadron, in the Soloman Islands in WWII. The original Black Sheep members were quite put off by the series and by Greg Boyington's connection with it. While the series presented the Black Sheep as drunks, misfits and womanizers, in actuality, the real Black Sheep were America's sons, brothers, husbands and fathers. They were, in my opinion, heroes, as were most of our WWII combatants. The series is based loosely on their real-life missions, which included two six-week tours. They were the most successful Marine aviation squadron of WWII",1177459200,3,805,4.970370370370371

The original pilot starts things off with a fairly accurate account of how the real Black Sheep became a fighter squadron. The first ten episodes are included and will not dissapoint. The set also includes interviews with Major Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, the former commander of the infamous Marine Fighter Squadron known as the Black Sheep, upon whom the show was based. Robert Conrad did an excellent job of portraying Boyington.

  I recommend this DVD set to anyone, as it has something for everybody. Be it drama, comedy or suspense, this show had it all, and now it can live on in your home.",1142726400,6,916,4.554878048780488
2252981,4,B0007YMWGY,"As a creator, writer, and producer of numerous TV programs, Stephen J. Cannell is an icon in the action adventure genre.  Loosely based on the exploits of WWII hero Major Greg `Pappy' Boyington in the Pacific theater, Baa Baa Black Sheep was one of Cannell's early efforts after The Rockford Files.  With an almost all male cast, it was a change of pace from the glut of prime time cop shows.

Charismatic Robert Conrad, best known up to this point for starring in TV's Wild Wild West, was ideal to play a larger than life Boyington, a Marine who did not always follow established military procedure.  At 35, `Pappy' was ancient for a fighter pilot.  Molded under his leadershjp, the Black Sheep, a hard drinking group of pilots, flew missions not always in strict accordance with military protocol, much to the consternation of a `by the book' Colonel Lard (Dana Elcar) who was gunning for Boyington.  Constantly covering Pappy's back, was General Moore, played by veteran actor Simon Oakland.

The adventures of the Black Sheep are straightforward and only loosely based in reality.  Things like the numerous escapes from enemy held islands are pure fiction, but the entertainment value of these episodes is still pretty high.  Typical for a Cannell production, there is plenty of action, explosions and gunfire, but with minimal bloodshed.  One example, in the episode Up for Grabs, a completely unrealistic surrender by the Japanese prevents a massacre.

Conrad was an experienced boxer, and took great pride in the stuntwork he did on the Wild Wild West, and there is no shortage of brawls and flying bodies.  Conrad's tough guy persona led to a series of commercials for Everready batteries that are considered classics.  Those used to CGI special effects may find primitive, the fighting sequences which combine stock and new footage.  However 30 years ago, flying restored 30-year old Corsairs and Zeros, and filming models were typically how things were done.

Many in the cast got their first real break in television here, and went on to long careers in the business.  Both Cannell, and associate producer Donald Bellisario, would employ various cast members in their future projects.  Larry Manetti became well known on Magnum P.I.  John Laroquette went on to success in Night Court and later McBride.  James Whitmore Jr. has become a popular director.  Dirk Blocker, son of Dan Blocker (Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza) has continued his acting career, as have Robert Ginty, Jeff MacKay and Joey Aresco, who played the mechanic Hutch.

This set is called `Volume 1' and includes the pilot, and the first ten episodes of the series.  It is not the complete first season.  The extras are minimal, which is unfortunate, as it would have been a treat to hear what Robert Conrad, Stephen Cannell or any of the show's other alumni have to say.  Hopefully the rest of the programs will be released soon.",1141776000,10,2904,4.9402061855670105

2252983,5,B0007YMWGY,"I was a hige fan of this series when it was on television, and I was even more excited to find that Universal had made this great DVD set of the first ten episodes plus the television pilot.  Robert Conrad stars as Major (later Colonel) Greg Boyington.  Boyington was flying with the American Volunteer Group (The Flying Tigers) in China right after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Mad because he was owed some $3,000 in back pay, he decided to return to the Marine Corps at his original rank of major.  After some difficulties with the Marine brass, he finally received his major's commission and set about forming his squadron.

Although the pilots in the series are portrayed as ""misfits"" awaiting court-martial, in reality, none of the pilots in the actual Black Sheep were up on any charges.  Most had become detatched from their original squadrons and hooked on with Boyington.  As for the cast of the show, Dirk Blocker (Lt. Bragg), Robert Ginty (Lt. Wiley), John Larroquette (Lt. Andersen), Jeff MacKay (Lt. French), Larry Manetti (Lt. Boyle), W.K. Stratton (Lt. Casey), and James Whitmore, Jr. (Capt. Gutterman) made up the Black Sheep.  Dana Elcar starred as the by-the-book Col. Lard, who never trusted Boyington and was out to get him at every turn.  Simon Oakland starred as General Moore.  He genuinely liked the Black Sheep and ran interference between Boyington and Lard.

The actual combat sequences are very good, overall.  Actual F4U Corsairs were used, and real battle footage was interspersed to give the combat sequences a much more realistic look.  This unit went on to become one of the most successful units in the South Pacific, racking up a kill record that many other units could only dream about.  Boyington himself accounted for twenty eight enemy planes, including the six he downed in China, making him the leading Marine Corps ace of the war.  He was shot down and remained in a Japanese prison camp until the end of the war.

This is a great collection.  I was thrilled to find it, and I have enjoyed watching each episode again.  I was 11 years old when the series premiered on televison, and I watched it every week.  Seeing these episodes again is like taking a trip back to my childhood.  The DVD quality is extremely high, and each episode is exactly as I remember it.  I give this collection my highest rtecommendation.  Hopefully, Universal will decide to put out another set which contains the remaining episodes.  Until then, watch this great collection and see how a unit of ""misfits"" became the terrors of the South Pacific.  Baa, Baa, Baa.",1137974400,19,2582,4.802721088435374

He put all these guys together and they formed the most fearsome squadron in the Pacific during WWII.

2252988,1,B0007YMWGY,"When I ordered Baa Baa Black Sheep, it was based on childhood memories of having seen the show when it was airing on television. At that time, I was less discerning about my interest in all things concerning WWII aircraft. Still, that's often the problem when one bases a decision to buy a dvd on childhood memories. There are so many historical inaccuracies and disappointments in this drama series that it makes for difficult and, at times, embarrassing viewing. Many instances are so illogical and absurd that even a preliminary knowledge of the history of the Black Sheep Squadron, Pappy Boyngton and the war in the Pacific reveals the shortcomings. For instance, the opening episodes, are punctuated with:

- Pappy Boyngton persuading Admiral Nimitz to promote him to Major over long distance telephone;

- a drunken, brawling band of misfits awaiting court marshall having their careers reinstated due to the unlikely efforts of Pappy Boyngton;

- a General portrayed as whiskey swilling and undisciplined, carousing with the band of misfits and then being persuaded by Boyngton to allow them to set up a squadron if Boyngton will keep him supplied with his favourite whiskey;

- the incumbent squadron being replaced as a result of Boyington masquerading as a doctor and persuading authorities that the incumbents are suffering from malaria and must be relieved;

- Boyngton's pilots refusing to obey orders and discipline falling apart when Boyngton crashes his plane and is missing on a Japanese occupied island.

The series cannot be viewed as historically relevant. It is a bawdy romp about a group of hard drinking, fist-fighting goons who are less interested in fighting the war and upholding the honour of the services they represent than they are in chasing women and engineering circumstances to gain whatever benefit the war can provide them. The characters are one dimensional types who act according to form without depth or interest. There is the Admiral's son who confronts demons of the past and is labelled a jinx - the female commander of the nurses who fawn over the airmen is a cardboard cutout of Vera, the tough prison warden of the Australian drama series, ""Prisoner"". Clearly this is a disservice to the brave men and women who fought in the Pacific war if it were ever to be regarded seriously - it is just too jocular, superficial, inaccurate and absurd. Instead, the series can only be viewed as a poorly scripted, fictitious '70s attempt at a comedy/drama without the intended humour and gags of Hogan's Heroes. Still, the aeroplanes are genuine and there are some decent aerial combat scenes. However, the problem is having to endure the silly plot-line in between the action.",1127606400,11,2711,5.013333333333334

2252994,5,B0007YMWGY,"Baa Baa Black Sheep was a short-lived NBC show that has finally been released on DVD, or at least part of it.  Marine Corps pilot Major Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington is fed up with his desk job in the rear area.  He puts together a squadron of misfits and screwballs and with stolen planes makes a base for the 214, the Black Sheep Squadron.  Loosely, very loosely, based on the real exploits of Pappy Boyington and his Black Sheep, this is a great DVD to watch.  Plenty of action with some great aerial footage, although some is used repeatedly, and just enough comedy to keep the mood light.  Robert Conrad is great as Maj. Greg ""Pappy"" Boyington, the unlikely hero and leader of the Black Sheep.  Simon Oakland and Dana Elcar star as General Moore and Colonel Lard, two of Boyington's superior officers.  The squadron includes James Whitmore JR, Dirk Blocker, WK Stratton, Robert Ginty, Tony Aresco, John Larroquette, Larry Manetti, and Jeff MacKay.  The Volume One DVD includes the two-hour pilot, The Flying Misfits, the next ten episodes, and a 7-minute interview with Greg Boyington and Robert Conrad which aired in 1976 as the show premiered.

1. ""The Flying Misfits""- Major Boyington puts together a squadron of figther pilots with pilots kicked out of other squadrons.

2. ""Best Three Out of Five""- Headquarters sends an officer to take over the Black Sheep.

3. ""Small War""- Pappy is accidentally shot down over a Japanese-held island.

4. ""High Jinx""- The Black Sheep believe a new pilot is a jinx.

5. ""Prisoners of War""- The Black Sheep discover they have much in common with a Japanese pilot in their keep.  Best episode of the bunch.

6. ""Presumed Dead""- A brainwashed American pilot is picked up by the Black Sheep.

7. ""The Meatball Circus""- The 214 uses Japanese planes to bomb a Japanese aircraft carrier.

8. ""Up For Grabs""- Japanese commandoes take over Vella La Cava in hopes of kidnapping General Douglas MacArthur.

9. ""Anyone for Suicide?""- Pappy volunteers the 214 for a suicide mission behind enemy lines.

10. ""New Georgia on My Mind""- The Black Sheep must share their base with paratroopers preparing for a mission.

11. ""The Cat's Whiskers""- Pappy thinks up an impossible mission in hopes of escaping a court martial.

2252999,5,B0007YMWGY,"Major ""Pappy"" Boyington (Robert Conrad) commanded the Black Sheep Squadron during World War II in the Pacific and fought the war his own way taking a team of misfits and turning them into a stellar flying fighting unit. While the TV series about Boyington had little to do with the real heroes that fought in World War II, it made for exciting TV in the 70's.

There are the expected analog artifacts visible particularly during the sequences involving stock footage (which got used quite a bit during the series). Also, some of the footage shot for the pilot and early episodes were recycled to cut costs where possible and, again, these bits of film betray the age of the series much more so than the episodes shot for each individual episode. Universal does a nice job with the picture there's the expected amount of grain for a vintage series. The flesh tones are solid although a bit on the warm side (but that's the way I remember the series when I watched it originally and even in syndication). Color is good throughout and the image is generally quite sharp although there are bits where the images are a bit soft. Audio is presented in the original mono without any embellishments. The mono sound is a bit muddy at times but the dialog is clear throughout most of the episodes. Compare the dirty footage from the pilot episode (granted it's an old videotape of the series pilot) to the digitally cleaned up footage here and you'll see that Universal has done a pretty decent job of cleaning up the show (even the stock footage looks better than I expected in many cases). Color matching is off during some of the stock footage but that was the case with the original series.

A 1976 interview from ""The Today Show"" featuring Boyington and Robert Conrad is the only extras included here. It's a fascinating glimpse into the past and it's also fun to hear Boyington reminisce about his squad and see his reaction to the footage from the pilot episode. The videotape this is drawn from is in pretty poor shape with a blurry image and indistinct colors. There's also an interview from 1959 featuring Boyington after the release of his book. Curiously, the 1976 segment is presented before the 1959 segment. Together the interviews run about 8 minutes and the latter segment was filmed in black & white. Each episode has the ""highlights"" trailer that preceded each episode showing key dramatic scenes

No commentary tracks which is a pity. Given that James Whitmore Jr. went on to become a director, it would have been interesting to hear his take on shooting the series. I never realized till much, much later that John Larroquette was a member of the cast during its two season run. Larroquette could also have provided an interesting commentary track as well. A retrospective featurette on the surviving cast members would also have been fun just to catch up with them and have them reflect on the difficult history of the series (it was cancelled and brought back retooled with a new title ""The Black Sheep Squardron"" during 1977-78).The pilots who flew the planes could provide some hair raising stories about the series I'm sure.

Considering the popularity of this series in syndication, I was rather surprised to see that there were only 37 episodes produced. I never realized there were so few done. Picture and sound quality are quite good while the extras are minimal they do include two vintage interviews one featuring Robert Conrad and Boyington and the other done just after Boyington's original book was published in 1959.",1118880000,70,3543,4.784313725490196
2253000,4,B0007YMWGY,"I watched this show when it first came out in the late 70s. Based very loosely on the memoirs of Col. Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, USMC, Ret. (also titled Baa Baa Black Sheep), it tells a fictionalised and highly romanticised account of the exploits of the Marine Corps Fighter Squadron VMF-214 (aka The Black Sheep). This ragtag squadron based in the Solomon islands created headlines when in a span of 12 weeks in late 1943, it accounted for 197 enemy planes destroyed or damaged. That run ended with Boyington's own downing by the Japanese and his subsequent secret internment as a POW. Upon his release at the end of the war, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his role as Commanding Officer of the Black Sheep.

The TV series of course takes liberties with actual history. Boyington and the Black Sheep were stationed at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides (present-day Vanuatu). They also flew from Vella Lavella but there was no island called Vella La Cava or Epiritos Marcos. Although Boyington describes his men as misfits and the series happily plays this up, more balanced later accounts note that the men were more likely stragglers who had been separated from their units or got lost in the general confusion of the war and army bureaucracy. His Intelligence Officer is on record noting that none of the men in the squadron were facing disciplinary action while they were with the unit. When the series aired with his name attached as Technical Advisor, surviving members of the Black Sheep recalled how they ribbed him about it and how he had to apologise. One of the veterans is quoted to have indignantly said, ""We never went up drunk. The only thing accurate about the show was that we flew Corsairs.""

The exploits of the Black Sheep form about a third of his memoirs. Prior to that, before America's entry into the war, Boyington had served with the Flying Tigers in China. He also served in Burma before Roosevelt declared war and he once again joined the Marines in the Pacific. Following his downing and capture by a Japanese submarine, he spent the remaining 20 months of the war as a POW. In the years after the war, he fought alcoholism, broken marriages, joblessness and ill-health. A line from his memoir sums it up poignantly. As he rode through the ticker-tape parade after receiving his Medal of Honor from President Truman, a well-wisher grabbed him by the arm and said, ""Enjoy it today, my boy, because they won't give you a job cleaning up the streets tomorrow."" He published his memoirs in 1958. He returned to part-time flying after partially overcoming his alcoholism. He finally died of lung cancer in 1988 at the age of 75. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. A true American hero. But as he himself wrote at the end of his book, ""If this story were to have a moral, then I would say, 'Just name a hero and I'll prove he's a bum.'""

NBC's Baa Baa Black Sheep lasted a total of just 2 seasons, the casualty of poor ratings (it was up against Charlie's Angels), and high cost. This was before the advent of cheap CGI effects. Those planes you see onscreen are the real deal, vintage F4U Corsairs put through their paces.

In an effort to milk as much money as possible from this re-release, NBC-Universal has slyly packaged the 2 seasons into what I believe will eventually be 3 premium priced boxed sets. Volume 1 contains just half of the first season. Talk about greed. (For comparison, Universal has just released a boxed set of the first 2 seasons of Quincy ME at the same price.) Universal has crammed all the episodes onto 2 double-sided DVDs. Some older DVD players have problems playing these double-sided Universal DVDs. On one player it just spun uselessly registering a blank screen.

This first half-season consists of the first 10 episodes plus the one and a half hour pilot ""Flying Misfits"". What has NBC-Universal done to justify the pretty exorbitant price? Well, one thing we can be thankful for is that they have provided a reasonably good restoration of the original film prints. Picture quality is generally very good, clean, clear and sharp (though not as good as on the aforementioned Quincy ME). There are still occasional film nicks and dirt specks but generally the quality of the studio based footage is very high considering this was made in 1976. Archival and older stock footage has not been restored. They look very grainy and grimy in comparison to the footage shot specifically for the series. But this is quite reasonable and even lends a certain authenticity to the episodes. Sound is a basic 2.0 mono but clean and clear. The extras last a grand total of 6 minutes and consists of two interviews with the real Pappy Boyington, one made in 1959 just after the success of his memoirs, and the other in 1976 on the occasion of the premiere of Baa Baa Black Sheep on NBC.

Bloopers: Stock footage of the corsairs is used repeatedly over the entire span of the series. One result is that the pilots' kill score reflected in the meatballs painted below the cockpits change haphazardly between episodes and even within episodes. Some of the archive footage has been used rather indiscriminately, the most obvious are the ones involving aircraft carriers. In the episode ""Meatball Circus"", the Black Sheep are supposed to land on the WW2 carrier Lexington. The footage however shows them approaching the modern carrier USS Ranger (CV61) with a full complement of jet fighters on deck. In at least 2 scenes we get to see helicopters taking off from the carrier when carriers did not have helicopters till well after WW2.

Note: The Black Sheep still flies today (redesignated VMA-214) as part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing in support of Marine Expeditionary Forces. They are presently equipped with AV-8B Night Attack Harriers (VSTOL/Jump-Jets). Their last major deployment was to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.",1118707200,280,5905,4.794695481335953

I enjoyed this show when it first aired almost 30 years ago, so I was excited when Baa Baa Black Sheep was released on DVD.  The stories are funny, sad, exciting and always feature excellent footage of many vintage aircraft.  The acting for the most part was great and featured a lot of young actors (such as John Larroquette, Larry Manetti, Robert Ginty and James Whitmore Jr.) who would make a much bigger splash later in television and films.  The mixture of current film with the newsreel film of Corsairs is very smoothly done and the DVD has a crisp, clear picture.  This set is a must if you enjoy good stories, WWII aircraft or just want to be entertained!!!",1118361600,,879,4.56687898089172
2253002,5,B0007YMWGY,"Without a doubt, Baa Baa Black Sheep was one of, if not the best show to ever come across the airwaves.  I highly urge anyone interested in WWII to check out this video.",1118275200,,169,4.121212121212121
2253003,5,B0007YMWGY,"I have waited for years for this series to come out on DVD.  Think of this series as MASH, only with fighter pilots from WW II instead of doctors from the Korean War.  If you loved MASH, you WILL love Baa Baa Black Sheep.  The show had plenty of action in each episode, and plenty of laughs.  If you like war movies, this show will be a compliment to your collection.  Even though it is a comedy series, the dogfights, carrier landings, and land battles keep you entertained the full hour of each episode.  I will be heart broken if they do not come out with the rest of all the episodes for the run of this great war series.",1117584000,3,625,4.166666666666667
2253004,5,B0007YMWGY,"I was surfing the net and came across this DVD of ""Black Sheep"" and you could have heard my whoop! from most any place in Kalamazoo, MI. I've waited for this DVD or video for years. I saw the show when it was on the History Channel but each episode was chopped up from the original series with parts missing. As far as I can tell all shows are uncut. They look better than the History Channel ones also. Clearer picture probably due to Digital remastering, etc. I'll surly get volum 2 and 3 if it goes that far. I was at the mall and the video/music store had one copy so I bought it before someone else saw it. I have books on the Black sheep, and a hard cover one of Pappy's book signed by ""Pappy"" himself! (At least the writting looks like it may have been a true autographed copy.)I got it at a book store here a long time ago here in Kalamazoo. I also taped the History Channel shows, but this DVD set is much better. If you are a ""Pappy"" fan as myself, you won't be disapointed.",1117584000,,984,4.103626943005182
2253005,5,B0007YMWGY,"I must say that it is about time this series came out on DVD.  I have been waiting almost 30 years to obtain this series on either VHS or DVD.  Well, my day has finally come and I have to admit it was worth it.  The transfers are excellent, with vibrant colors, clear images and no glitches that I have found so far.  The bonus footage of interviews with the real Pappy Boyington, alone, makes this DVD purchase worth it.  Granted, the series bears little resemblance to the real life exploits of the Black Sheep, but this ""Hollywoodized"" version is pure entertainment.  And a good one at that.  The storylines are captivating and exciting and make you want more.  What's not to like about Pappy's Corsairs kicking the butt's of the Japanese Zero's each week.  Exciting stuff! As an aside, few people realize the profound impact this series had on the resurgence of interest in W.W.II aviation.  Boyington, the Black Sheep, and the F4U Corsair became common household names due to this show.  Because of this notoriety, the modern ""warbird"" movement was given a quick jolt of popularity.  Back in 1978, at the time of the series, one could purchase one of the authentic W.W.II F4U Corsairs for around $100,000 to $150,000 dollars.  Now that same plane can't be touched for under $ 1.5 million.  This is due largely to the popularity of the Black Sheep Squadron t.v. series.  Overall, though, this series is excellent!  I just wish they would have included more bonus material and stuff outside of the series itself.  They could have had interviews with some of the actors, a director or producer commentary, or even outtakes.  Several of the pilots that flew in the show are still alive.  Some of their stories about the filming would have been awesome!  I have heard that they nearly lost a Corsair or 2 during filming.  It would have been neat to hear about it firsthand!

Highly recommended",1117411200,3,1893,4.7073170731707314
2253006,5,B0007YMWGY,"Sure, I also wish the whole 1st season was in this set, but I'm just happy that it's out, a very pleasant surprise, it was my favorite show when I was a kid. The way the Black Sheep came together under Boyington's guidance from a motley group of drunks and misfits ready to be thrown in the brig into the hottest fighter squadron in the South Pacific Theater of WWII is an inspiring story well told in this show. You feel close to the characters and their personal interaction makes you feel like you live in a tent on Vella La Cava and you're up in a Corsair with them. I never expected this show to come out on DVD due to the fact it was sadly cancelled after two seasons, and its' low ratings at the time. It seemed pretty popular on reruns though and most recently on the History Channel, that may have spurred the production of this dvd release. The early shows with Capt. Gutterman, T.J. Wiley and Hutch as their mechanic were the best as far as action goes, and the plots weren't nearly as good in the second season, but Pappy's Lambs especially Cathy McCullough and Brianne Leary were pretty sweet. It's amazing the way Pappy always cons his way out of trouble from the Marine Corp higher ups, he was such a hard-ass yet he seemed approachable and really cared about the lives and welfare of his men. Looking forward to the next volume!! I think it will have the Japanese Ace Hirachi, Boyington's rival.",1117324800,2,1411,4.409961685823755
2253007,5,B0007YMWGY,"One of the proudest claims I can make about my life is being a former Marine, like Maj. Gregory ""Gramps"" Boyington; albiet an unknown to one of the most famous. (""The Duke"" John Wayne wanted to be a Marine & didn't make it!) The only thing that gives me more pride is knowing these heroes respected guys like my sainted Dad, who flew gas & trash over ""the Hump"" in C-47's (the gray cargo plane in the series) from India into China over the Himalayas in support of their combat against the Japs.

I was at NAS Lakehurst in 1978 when this great show aired on commercial T.V. and, even though most of us knew the show was highly Hollywoodized, we would still take over the barracks rec room everytime it aired, and would yell & cheer like Limey football fans thru every combat scene in each episode.

With all the second rate crapola flooding the market these days, it's GREAT to see DVD's of a show worth the expense hit the shelves, and I really hope the entire series will be issued  sooner or later (PREFERREDLY SOONER!!!!!!)",1117238400,,1026,4.446808510638298

2253013,3,B0007YMWGY,"When I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see that I was only getting half of Season One.  I need to train myself to make sure that the Title reads ""Season One"" instead of ""Volume One.""  After the initial shock, I started to enjoy the episodes I remember when the show was called ""Baa Baa Black Sheep.""  I like how they kept the scenes of what was to come before the opening...a 70's TV drama thing.",1116979200,20,408,4.205128205128205
2253014,4,B0007YMWGY,"I eagerly awaited for this series to come out on DVD and now that I have it I was disappointed in the way they produced it. FIrst I don't care for the two sided discs but the main disappointment was the fact that they didn't include all of Season one's shows, just 10 shows plus the pilot. Since this show only ran two years and considering how much they charged (which is reasonable for a Season One if it is complete!!!) It seems to me that they should have included the complete season One. I sure hope they put out the rest of Season One and for Season Two put all of the showes out at once!! This is a great show, Robert Conrad is so sexy in that tight flight suit, sort of distracts me from the  FU-4s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1116892800,2,722,4.194244604316546

2253016,5,B0007YMWGY,"Am placing my order today for this one.  Black Sheep Squadron is a wonderful show about WWII, specifically war in the pacific.  It was way ahead of its time in the mid '70s and didn't get a fair shake back then.  History Channel ran the show on Saturdays a few years back.  I think the DVD version will generate new interest.  The real Pappy Boyington makes a few cameo appearances in the series.",1116288000,2,396,4.36986301369863

Great series about VMF-214, the black sheep squadron, and their commander Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, one of the greatest fighter pilots ever. I'd also reccomend books like Black Sheep One, Baa Baa Black Sheep, and The Black Sheep Squadron.",1116028800,2,374,4.681818181818182
2253020,5,B0007YMWGY,"My younger brother was really into WWII and the Civil War and it rubbed off onto me so to this day I still enjoy a good film made in either of those period settings. My brother used to build model airplanes, mostly WWII ones, and that was my first introduction to the Corsair. Baa Baa Black Sheep was my second and it was cool seeing some in action. Besides Robert Conrad, the only other person that I can remember from it (I hadn't seen it since it originally aired) is Dirk Blocker, son of the late Dan ""Hoss Cartwright"" Blocker, looking a lot like him.

Anyway, I'm definitely getting all of the BBBS sets upon release!",1115683200,2,622,4.362068965517241
