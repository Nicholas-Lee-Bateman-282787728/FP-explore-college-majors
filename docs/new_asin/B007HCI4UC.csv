5086027,4,B007HCI4UC,"This AIP comedy has got to be one of the silliest they ever produced but it is endearing nevertheless and lots of fun. It also has some nice original songs. The quality of the MGM MOD DVD is a stunning 2.35 Panavision image with great color. It actually looks
remastered. There are certainly worse ways to spend 90 minutes.",1390694400,2,323,4.491525423728813
5086028,4,B007HCI4UC,"Zany service comedy featuring most of the Beach Party gang in their heyday! Frankie is an astro-nut who trades intelligences with a chimpanzee for some outer space shenanigans.  This was the fourth film Frankie made with Dwayne Hickman in 1965. Sixties songstress, Donna Loren, even shows up for good measure!  Great to see this one finally on DVD for all of you Beach Party collectors!",1371772800,2,386,4.923076923076923

5086041,3,B007HCI4UC,"The bad news on this film is that much of the dialogue was poorly written and poor Fred Clark's character seems much more like a minimum wage worker rather than a general. There are plenty of missed opportunities for wittier dialogue and more interesting plot devices.

The good news is that you can still enjoy a mid-60's comedy w/light scifi aspects that features a good cast. Fortunately, Eve Arden's character is the most vibrant and best conceived. Cesar Romero and Reginald Gardiner are both excellent in their supporting roles as NATO officers. Harvey Lembeck does a nice job with his creepy character.  Likable Frankie Avalon and Deborah Walley do their best with the material at hand, and the musical numbers are decent enough. Probably one of the funniest characters in the film is the virtually unseen ""President"" (obviously a parody of Lyndon Johnson) by Pat Buttram.",1416873600,,879,5.013698630136986

5086051,5,B007HCI4UC,"This is one of Frankie's lesser known films in that he is not paired with Annette Funicello. Still, it is very cute and funny. It features some big-name stars like Deborah Walley, Eve Arden, Cesar Romero, Gale Gordon of ""Lucy"" fame, Harvey Lembeck and a lot of the ""Beach Party"" gang from Annette and Frankie's films. The plot is basic: Sergeant Deadhead is a sweet, somewhat naive, bumbling fool in the Air Force who accidentally ends up in a rocket with a chimp. After they orbit into space and return, Deadhead is hailed a National hero and is transformed into a big-headed egotistical jerk who thinks he can order the officers around. The military, seeing that Deadhead's massive ego is bad for their image, manage to find a lookalike. Walley as Airman Lucy Turner is desperately trying to wed Deadhead, but the wedding keeps getting delayed until she's fooled by the top brass to marry the lookalike. Of course there's a case of mixed identities between Deadhead and the lookalike, but it's all in fun. Interestingly, AIP (American International Pictures) decided to make this film in hopes that a military comedy would prove as popular as the beach party comedies. Unfortunately, it bombed at the box office. There was supposed to be a second Deadhead comedy called ""Sergeant Deadhead Goes to Mars"" but because this movie failed, it was never made. I like this film because there's music, just like the beach party films, plus you get to see all the popular Beach Party actors such as Donna Loren, Buster Keaton and Harvey Lembeck. There's a clever musical sequence where the women airmen all sing in their bunks, using flashlights to illuminate their faces as they sing their solos. Donna Loren, of course, leads this sequence with her beautiful voice, but surprisingly some of the other Beach Party regulars can also sing. If you don't mind Annette's absence, this film is a delightful family comedy, goofy fun just like the Beach Party movies. Of course, it would have wonderful if she was in this movie, but Annette was married and pregnant with her first daughter Gina by the time this movie was made. An enjoyable romp!",1405123200,6,2131,4.825136612021858
5086052,5,B007HCI4UC,"I love this movie, but it takes a certain kind of sense of humor. This is a very wacky movie and if you don't have a wacky sense of humor, you won't like it.",1404000000,,157,3.6470588235294117
