Love this movie. It took me two years to find t he dvd  but it was worth the wait. I never saw Danica Mckeller in a movie before but She stole the show and look forward to seeing Her in other productions.",1389052800,2,234,3.978723404255319
5861163,5,B00DW7IV5O,A great holiday movie.  Good acting and a good storyline told across time.  Coupled with tradition and a sense of family. It is worth watching again and again.,1388534400,2,159,4.642857142857143
5861164,5,B00DW7IV5O,"Watching this movie for the 2nd time this evening--watched it the first time a few days ago. It holds a certain quality difficult [for a man] to describe. I like it so much I ordered it today from Amazon. Initially, it seems to drag on a bit, but after awhile ya' get caught up in the length of time taken between the two main players before they commit to one another. I especially like this movie because it seems more real than so many [other] contrived movies. I like both main characters plus the supporting cast. I could see this actually occurring & it makes my heart grow a little larger at each viewing. I realize I sound sappy saying this--but it works for me--and I'm a 69-year-old Vietnam Veteran.",1385683200,42,709,4.461538461538462

5861166,5,B00DW7IV5O,"I bought this for my husband as it is one of his favorite Christmas movies. The two leads Danica McKellarv (The Wonder Years) and Dustin Milligan (90210) did a good job in their respective roles. There were a few well known supporting actors as well in Alexandra Paul (Baywatch), Lea Thompson (Jane Doe mystery series), and Scott Patterson (Gilmore Girls),",1384992000,16,356,4.95
5861167,4,B00DW7IV5O,"Somewhere in Illinois there is a 30-year-old tradition (give or take a few years). It revolves around two childhood best friends Kat and Samwise (yes, named after the hobbit). The tradition began in 1984 when they were four years old and their dads brought over a children's dinner table. From then on, Kat and Sam shared Christmas Eve at the children's table. We're presented with a plot conceit in which we watch our two leads' lives intersect for only one night a year (""Like Brigadoon,"" to quote Kat). And that night is always Christmas Eve. It's told mostly in episodic flashbacks and bookended by a present-day storyline in which Sam returns home after five years away.

Maybe the huge frustration about this movie is why the long wait? Why did it take 30 years (give or take) for these two obvious soul mates to get together? The glib answer, of course, is that then there'd be no movie. ""Contrive, writers, contrive!!"" must've urged them studio producers. Maybe you should watch this during the holidays. Then you'd be more forgiving about the manipulative, string-it-out plot. Danica McKellar (""Kat Patton"") and Dustin Mulligan (""Sam Reid"") easily win you over. Dustin is effortlessly charming. Aspiring great romancers should take note of the things Dustin's character does in his time with Kat. Danica McKellar, well, it's Danica McKellar. She's sweet and lovely and can act with fine drama or be engagingly playful. Should I even mention that she's a math whiz in real life? She and Dustin sparkle in the small moments and in the big emotional moments.

I love that there are literary references. There's one in particular, drawn from Dickens' Great Expectations, that applies to Lea Thompson's character. I gaze at Lea Thompson and feel the age in my bones. Wasn't too long ago, seems like, when I was mooning over her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Some-Kind-of-Wonderful-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00AG475K8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Some Kind of Wonderful (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and, yes, I'm not ashamed,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-the-Duck/dp/B0021GS3JG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard the Duck</a>. Here, she has a stand-out scene in which she consoles a devastated Kat and gives her some good advice. However, my favorite reference has to do with a grown-up Sam's asking a bunch of children gathered around the table this all-important question: ""What is best in life?"" If you know the proper response to that, then you, dear reader, are my brother forever more. Or sister. Whichever. The ""Best Life"" game is something that Kat and Sam have played all their lives.

This is a Lifetime movie, but hold up, it's one of the good Lifetime movies, despite the hiccups. Okay, one thing that had me raising an eyebrow was the intense argument between Kat and Sam that came out of nowhere and took a crushingly ugly turn. Also I question that these two, being such fast friends, wouldn't actually know more details about each other's job. And I never did get why each Christmas Eve is spent at Lea Thompson's house. But you know what? Ultimately I didn't care about the nitpicks. The two leads strike up such good chemistry and their Christmas Eve interludes are so much fun to watch that I was won over pretty much from jump. The best scene - in a film full of wonderful scenes - has to be the Kat & Sam dance. That scene alone puts a lid on a heap of plot holes.",1374019200,36,3502,5.227758007117438

5861192,4,B00DW7IV5O,"This movie has some well-known actors and does a decent job with the premise. The ideas is that the movie follows a couple of kids whose fathers own a furniture company through many years of Christmases. It appears as though they only see each other at the company Christmas party which is held at a house of a mutual friend who loves Christmas. Over the years, they sort of go back and forth between annoying each other and having an apparent crush on each other. As the years go by, they develop a more deep and meaningful relationship, but the boy moves off to college and does other things while the girl stays home and ends up working for the father. The movie seems to cover their lives from about age 6 to about age 30. The table in the title is a small kids table that is one of the fathers' first furniture items. Many of the scenes take place around the table over the years and there is always a theme of the characters being around kids. This is a fairly nice family movie that has a happy ending. The scope of the movie is fairly narrow with most of the scenes being yet another Christmas in the long series. The movie isn't terribly exciting or action-packed, but it does a nice job with the story it has and it's worth watching as a Christmas movie.",1513209600,,1264,4.315126050420168

5861211,4,B00DW7IV5O,"This is a sweet Christmas movie that I first saw on TV but it's good enough to watch every few years at Christmas, so I bought it.
It's a little bit different than all the other oft-recycled, boy meets girl, finds love at Christmas time, Hallmark and Lifetime movies.
It's just well cast, acted and directed, well done. The characters have more personality development than ""a high-powered executive who has lost her Christmas spirit"", etc.",1484179200,5,440,4.88
5861212,4,B00DW7IV5O,"It's a feel good film, that you know how it will ultimately turn out as soon as it begins, because that what this sort of film does.  We see a guy  drop a ring box under the kids table without noticing, then we go to a flashback thirty years before or so where we see the main guy now a little kid, being bugged by a little girl.  Of course the little girl and boy are the two main characters of this film and we'll see through a number of flashbacks that the two enjoy taunting each other and basically avoiding the other relatives and friends at some woman's home who never takes down the Christmas decorations all year.  For reasons that make absoutely no sense considering this is a small town and their father's together own the same furniture manufacturing business, the only day each year the two ever see each other is this Christmas party.  Even though the two obviously love each others company and which ever is there first keeps looking at the door in anticipation for the other to arrive.  As they grow older the guy moves away but comes still comes back for the Christmas party every year.

This is a low budget likely made for TV movie, which follows the formula of having a recognisable face actor from a once highly popular TV show with Danica McKellar as female main character. who of course played Winnie on The Wonder Years.  Other actresses play the younger versions of her character but she plays Kat from 19 year old to 30 something.  I didn't really buy her as being a 19 year old, there was obviously a decision made to use the well known actress as much as possible rather than use other unknown teen actresses at this point of the film which is a shame as she looks like a mid 30's year old with her hair tied back not a teen.

The scenario would have been a bit more plausible if it hadn't ranged over 25 years or something and the movie ended when they were around their early 20's.  If you hit it off with someone, you're at least going to be friends with them outside of a Christmas party.  It might have made more sense if they were two families not from the same town who just came every year to visit the same woman's hotel or something each Christmas, and it was set decades ago before social media, e-mail and phones made it easy to keep in touch.  But even letters, in this scenario, surely they would have posted letters to each other, maybe not as little kids but at least as teens old enough to notice the opposite sex.",1483660800,,2459,4.331154684095861

5861217,2,B00DW7IV5O,"A tedious recount of Christmases past, vague vignettes that detail little in the lives of two children.  It is apparent at the start that they don't have a relationship and never did.  For most of the film, the children playing the couple act as if they are distant cousins they only see once a year on Christmas.  Then they become adults with uncertain expectations.  He has no idea what she does as an adult and she has no idea what he does.  Everything culminates into an unpleasant showdown, hardly the basis for a romance.
I found very little in the plot or the characters to be enamored by.
They were so desperate to make a point that they had to refer to Dickens classic, Great Expectations to explain what they couldn't demonstrate in 90 minutes of wasted time.",1482710400,,769,4.543478260869565

5861309,1,B00DW7IV5O,"We rented this movie because it has an excellent concept... a  romance blossoming out of 30 years at the kids table is a brilliant concept. We wanted to watch a Christmas movie at Christmas time, and who can't relate to the kids table? At this writing, the movie received an overwhelming amount of 5 star reviews, so, with high hopes, we made the decision to spend money to watch it. Since we spent money on this, it's quite a disappointment. We've never turned off a movie before, but we did with this one. We tried to give it a chance, but it didn't seem to get better. The characters are not well introduced. The dialogue is cryptic. The story is hard to follow. The movie takes place in a house showing Christmas eve every 5 years where we are only given snippets of dialogue leaving us to wonder, whose house is this? Why do they have Christmas Eve there? Why does this Christmas lady who seems to love Christmas seem like she's always angry at the kids? Why didn't the father count her as someone the daughter has in her life? (We never figured out who the lady is even though she is a main character). Who are the little kids who suddenly appear at the table? Why do the two ""stars"" only see each other once a year if their Dad's work together? And yet in 1 minute of dialogue, we learn they have a rich history of knowing each others dates and what not. If they only see each other at Christmas Eve, how do they have this history? The movie yields more questions than providing a story to immerse in. Movies are supposed to be visual, and there is nothing presented visually. It's all through dialogue, and even with that, we are given very little to piece together to figure out what is happening. The worst thing is, we didn't find anyone in the movie likable (no fault on the actors - there isn't a story or characterization for them to latch onto). I'm mostly frustrated because this could be a great movie. It should live up to it's marketing. The script is several revisions away from being a finished product where I would be willing to pay the same amount of money for it as I do with movies like The Hobbit. The write up sounded so fun, we were so excited. I wish I could have my money back since we could not get through this movie. =(",1419811200,5,2253,4.326241134751773

I had recorded it on my tv, but decided just to order it and erased my recording.  Wish I had tried watching it that way first, would have been interesting to see if it sounded any clearer.  I own a huge movie collection, including other dvd's with no subtitles if that is the only way they come.

So, of course, I had to watch all of this movie. I'm glad I did. This Miss Havisham reference is a little heavy-handed as a plot device, but even with that, it's a well-written and well-acted romcom, swear-free! There might be a swear jar lurking in the background of the writer's room to account for that. If so, I'm glad it's there. This is a family-friendly movie that does not have THAT much to do with Christmas but half of the movie sparkles with twinkling Christmas lights, it seems. Playing games, drinking nog, dancing or at least listening to music, all the things that are familiar around the holiday - everything important happens in the context of 'home for Christmas.'

Danica McKellar is also good in this movie, as is Lea Thompson. Some of the other actors are very familiar but not as well-known. They should be! This crowd of friends and family is very convincing. I'll be watching this during the Christmas season for sure.",1524096000,3,1214,4.694835680751174
