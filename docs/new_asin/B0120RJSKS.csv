8725210,2,B0120RJSKS,"The only thing I can imagine all the 5 star reviews are for is that it must be some of her friends.  Techniques are full of new age Mumbo-Jumbo.. Feel the safe pace you were in while in the womb,  floating in peace,  Know the boundaries of your pain,  Where is the pain,  what is your pain trying to tell you, etc, etc.

Maybe the exercises will help but this is not a good or impressive beginning.... she sounds like a snake oil saleswoman selling feely-feely ideas

Will update later with effectiveness of exercises.

......

Update:  OK, have used this DVD for several days.  If you are looking for straight Feldenkrais this isn't for you.  The training and techniques are shot thru with new age Body Harmony techniques and teaching also and IMO this detracts from people looking to try Feldenkrais and if you don't put much creditability into New Age Feely teaching its even worse.  Raised review to 2 stars though as I suppose this would work for some people and I suspect the number of 5 star reviews is from accolades.  But we are putting this DVD in a yard sale ourselves.  People looking for Feldenkrais look elsewhere",1479945600,4,1127,4.565
8725211,5,B0120RJSKS,"After my long journey of trying to find someone to work with me, and all of my physical limitations after a terrible hit and run accident; I finally found Shara.  She was highly recommended to me. I had been to every doctor and every type of rehab for my injuries. I was discharged saying that the way I was is the best I will be. I refused to believe them and started searching for more support.  I suffer from Chronic pain at times.  My Feldenkrais session with Shara was unbelievable.  Her professional techniques that she used  were with small gentle movements.  Shara was genuinely concerned for me as well as being welcoming and non judgemental,  Shara guided me throughout the session with simple instructions and a supportive calming demeanor  I was amazed after a short period in the session I had no pain anywhere.

Two weeks later I am pain free.  I look forward to my next session with Shara.  I highly recommend if you are suffering from Chronic pain that you give it a try.  You have nothing to lose except becoming pain free!

8725212,5,B0120RJSKS,"subtle, gentle movements that make a lot of difference. You will feel the effects immediately, and for greatest benefit you can incorporate it into your everyday life because they don't take very long or a special set up with special instruments. Shara's gentle voice and loving instructions help a lot in giving yourself the permission to take time to heal. Thanks.",1454198400,,366,5.016393442622951
8725213,5,B0120RJSKS,"OH, I listened to Shara's meditation section the other night. It took me into a very unusual place in my subconscious or something... that night I had the most vivid real-like dreams that I'll never forget for the rest of my life!",1453507200,,230,4.5
8725214,5,B0120RJSKS,"This DVD is a very effective new way for me to deal with arthritic and overuse pain from decades of my lifestyle of intense recreational exercise.  I just completed watching each of the 8 instructive modules, one a day, and look forward to repeating those that are most helpful to me, on a regular basis.  The very gentle and meditative exercises seem like one is barely moving and yet they so effectively helped to relax tension, and reduce discomfort and increase body awareness.  I particularly liked how it helped me to find ways to move move efficiently, in combination with breathing awareness.  Whether the exercises worked with the pelvis, the shoulders, or the ankles  I felt more pain free, relaxed and energetic at the same time, after completion.  I've already tried Shara's Comfort for Life DVD, and look forward to also trying her Thoracic Outlet Syndrome & Shoulder pain one!",1452211200,6,890,4.9
8725215,5,B0120RJSKS,"I am a retired physician and in my practice I saw many pain patients. It is a very common problem for which medicine does not have sufficient answers. Shara has put in a lot of thought & work into this video and I think it offers an excellent strategy for those who do not find sufficient relief from what doctors have to offer. It combines Breathing, Meditation and body movements which are very practical and should offer relief of pain symptoms and a better night's sleep to boost. I really think it is worth a try. It is a very inexpensive way to deal with the problems, far cheaper than the medicines we prescribe..",1452211200,11,620,4.447368421052632
8725216,5,B0120RJSKS,I have had chronic pain in my shoulders and back for years.  Each of the treatments had a positive healing impact.  I found the natural way The instructor integrated both mind and body was invaluable.  I look forward to using this DVD on on a regular basis!,1451174400,2,257,4.425531914893617
