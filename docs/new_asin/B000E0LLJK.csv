8103132,2,B000E0LLJK,"One of Karloff's cheap Mexican movies and not worth watching unless your a big Karloff fan like myself. It's cheaply made and Karloff is
not in much of the movie and it's hard to watch. I got it on VHS cheap years ago so it was worth it. I would not start with these movies
if you are thinking of buying any Karloff movies! start with one of his movie sets that are out there on DVD now. Most are Universal
movies so do your research there are lots of these old cheap movies out there for sale that aren't very good!",1422921600,,516,4.068627450980392
