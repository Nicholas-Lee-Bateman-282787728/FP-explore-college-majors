1001993,4,6305240019,"Very smart, very enjoyable, very well-written, very well-acted, by Heche especially (never sexier). Details that really add to the film. For example:

SPOILERS

She didn't tell them she was Lewis's sister. She should have. Therefore Tony has every right to bail. On the other hand -- who wouldn't do all they could (well, most everyone; families are tricky things) to save a sibling from the rope?

Great touch at the end -- a really intelligent script -- where Lewis says, in jail, to Sheriff, I knew you'd return, even if you didn't.

And the best touch of all, one I was waiting for, one I was thinking they'd forgotten, perfectly dropped back in: Sheriff WAS, in fact, mostly to blame for their predicament. Lewis was trying to return the bike they had rented -- the bike whose owner returned w the police to fetch, thereby finding the hash -- and Sheriff twice told him to ""lose the bike"" -- they had been driven off the road, the bike was damaged, it was a nuisance to drag along (another fine detail) and Sheriff tosses it into the undergrowth.

And yet another thing to like -- a really accurate picture of how most New Yorkers live -- nothing glamorous about it.

Also -- catch the credits at the end; was that some Pennsylvania prison that doubled for the Malaysian jail?? Don't do a crime in PA!",1480377600,,1306,4.55982905982906

1002192,3,6305240019,"""Return to Paradise"" (1998) is about three Americans in Malaysia. Two of them are friends from New York City (Vincent Vaughn and David Conrad) and the other they meet there, an environmental-hippie type (Joaquin Phoenix). The three have a great time partying together and then the two from New York go back to the grind in the USA. Two years later they find out that their friend in Malaysia has been in prison for having too much hashish, which the three purchased together. Due to the country's severe drug laws, those considered traffickers are put to death and, unfortunately, the hippie possessed beyond the limit. He'll hang in eight days unless the other two go back and they'll all get 3 years in prison; if only one goes back it's 6 years each. Will they go back?

That's the set-up of the film and it's not a spoiler since this all unfolds in the first 20 minutes, which means that most of the rest of the movie takes place in New York and focuses on whether or not the other two will go back and save their friend. Keep in mind that this was a dude they met in Malaysia so it's not like they were bosom buddies from their youth or anything.

The trailer of ""Return to Paradise"" miss-advertised the film as a thriller largely taking place in exotic SE Asia, but that's not the case. This is a drama that involves a moral conundrum, a Christ figure and possible redemption. The story concentrates on Vaughn and Anne Heche, the latter as the lawyer of the hippie who tries to convince the other two to go back to save their friend. Complicating the situation even further is the fact that there are no legal documents involved since Malaysia is a third world country and, as such, there's no guarantee that the two will ""only"" get three years. And what about the other potential negative possibilities, like never making it out of the hellhole alive?

This is a top of the line film and the producers went all-out to serve up a quality picture; for instance, the Malaysian prison scenes are very convincing. Also, the actors are great across the board and Vaughn proves that he can nail a dramatic role. Moreover the moral is to die for, no pun intended. Unfortunately the actors are strapped to the contrivances of the plot and I had a hard time seeing them as real people in a real situation. In other words, it seemed like the characters do this-or-that merely because the screenplay says he or she is supposed to do this-or-that at that moment. And so I was never really able to embrace them as real people, but rather as puppets manipulated by the script. Still, it's not bad and it's worth catching if you like the actors and the story trips your trigger.

The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in New York City, Thailand, New Jersey, Philadelphia and China.

1002199,3,6305240019,"Return to Paradise is a 90's film that poses the dilemma of would you sacrifice 3 years (or 6 if you are the only one to do the right thing) of your own life, if it would save the life of a friend you met while traveling who will be executed if you do nothing, for a crime you not only participated in but you were also  responsible for the police being there to discover the drugs in the first place?  You'd like to think  everyone would take responsibility for their actions and see it as a no brainer, put their hand up, do the time and save their friend's life.  But the real world isn't like that and the moral dilemma of two guys currently safe to go on with their everyday lives in New York if they do nothing, instead of doing time in a Malaysian prison is what we the viewer follow for a good chunk of the film.

The premise is a good one but ultimately the way the film portrayed the scenario wasn't that believable to me.  This review contain spoilers if you wish to read on.  The film at no time indicates that the US government was even aware, let alone involved at all in trying to save the life of one of its citizens.  Surely the US consulate would have been the first point of call for Phoenix's character when he was charged with a crime involving the death penalty or even just a lengthy stint in a foreign jail.  At least by his lawyer if not by him.  Yet the sister never refers to them at all and we don't see them in the court scenes.  Also both of the New York friends don't contact them or even lawyers of their own to make sure what is being offered by this suddenly in their faces lawyer is legit.  Obviously she wasn't really a lawyer and is in fact the sister would have been the first thing pointed out to them if they did.  I can't see anyone confessing to a crime without legal advice, especially one that someone else has been convicted of and is about to be executed in a few days.

The sister character was well acted by Anne Heche but as a character didn't play her hand that well.  This is a what if I was in their shoes type movie and I think the viewer also places themselves in the sister's shoes as well as the boys.  In the sister's I wouldn't have been meeting each of the guys separately, I would have invited them to a dinner or lodge somewhere with the promise of a gift from their former travel companion (we know they know he was wealthy and they aren't doing too well themselves), perhaps they even expect to meet up with him  and then when they get there explain he is facing the death and the gift is the video of him pleading with them to confess. Then let them guilt and pressure each other into doing the right thing.  Then play the give them money card if need be, sleep with them to get them there, stay on the path if need be cards (and yes you would do this, you'd do whatever it took to save your brother's life).  I guess she pretended to be a lawyer as the deal she spoke of probably wasn't really on the cards and she just hoped that by showing the Malaysian court there were three of them there the amount of drugs would be divided and her brother's grade of charges lessened to where the death penalty wasn't in play.  But if there was a deal she would have been better off telling them from the start she was his sister and it would be harder to condemn a man to death to his sister's face, rather than a lawyer's.

I also didn't buy the whole big bad media angle.  There's no way an American facing execution wouldn't be in their radar already.  The Malaysian government wants to make an example of him so other foreigners respect their culture and laws, that the whole point of executing him.  They would have told the foreign media when he was sentenced to hang.  Plus how did the ""evil career ahead of man's life"" journalist know she was in New York anyway?  Plus we do this whole side story and never return to a scene with her reflecting on her actions internally or with other journalists in the office, or especially with the sister after the final events in the film.  The film needed that scene.

Speaking of other left hanging scenes, what happened to Vince Vaughn's character?  Does he also get executed or was the so called deal the sister pitched real and was honoured?  Did he ever see the sister again while behind bars after she visited him to find out the final moments of her brother and had a I'm sorry you're here for nothing for six years because of me but thanks anyway visit.  Sure guilt may have made her promise to come back and visit him but did she really do it when obviously she slept with him at the hotel in the bath because she was pretty sure both the guys were having second thoughts when they were going into their rooms and she needed him to continue on track and convince Tony to stay too.

Return to Paradise is a good stimulate discussion movie so best viewed in a group or at least passed around to discuss later.  But it does have it flaws.",1401494400,,4947,4.217622080679406

I can't remember when Heche did not give a stellar performance. She shines on screen and demands your attention at the start of her first words.

I have to mention the other stars of this compelling piece of work: Vince Vaughn, David Conrad of the ""Ghost Whisperer"" series and Kara Pinkett-Smith as the determined newspaper reporting who's relentless when getting a story.

1002378,5,6305240019,"This movie is about personal integrity and offers some of the most powerful performances I've ever seen by Joaquin Phoenix as Lewis McBride & Vincent Vaughn as John 'Sheriff' Volgecherev.  The plot sets up the moral quandry - one of three vacationing Americans (Lewis) is jailed and sentenced to death in Malaysia and, after serving two years of the jail sentence in squalor and deprivation, is scheduled to be executed by hanging in 8 days.  Lewis was convicted of drug trafficking due to the amount of hashish left behind when two of the Americans with whom he was vacationing returned to the U.S.  As Americans in a foreign country, although they did not know one another prior to the vacation, they partied together during the vacation and became friends.  If both the American friends return, stand trial & serve sentences in Malaysia, Lewis will not be executed & his sentence will be reduced to just 3 years (1 yr remaining).  If only one friend returns and serves his sentence, both Lewis and the friend will have 6-yr sentences but Lewis will not be executed.  Sheriff and Tony Croft (David Conrad) are approached by McBride's attorney, Beth Eastern (Anne Heche).  Unbeknownst to them, she is McBride's sister.  Beth's dogged pursuit of Sheriff and Tony is impassioned by her love for her brother yet her relationship with Lewis is not divulged until later.  While both agree to return at first, only Sheriff manages to follow through.  He is shocked at the sight of McBride yet despite his own fear, he manages to be the rock upon which McBride must rely in enduring what faces him.  Upon witnessing the strength and ultimate selflessness of Sheriff, Beth falls in love with him and she promises that she will be there for him when he is released.

In summary, Sheriff & Tony are asked to accompany attorney Beth Eastern back to Malaysia and sacrifice 3-6 yrs of their lives, spending it in the confines of a prison that is rather horrific compared to U.S. standards, in order to save the life of a fellow American they met while vacationing.  The decision is made more difficult since the bonds from close friendship or family are absent.  The decision to Return to Paradise, sans these emotional bonds, is thereby made based solely on the sense of responsibility each man feels as well as his own perception regarding what sacrifice he expects of himself to shoulder that responsibility.

This is a film which delivers a great plot and outstanding performances and keeps the viewer's interest.  The issues that are broached and the manner in which each character deals with them are arresting and a viewer will not remain untouched by the enormity of the human condition.  This film focuses more on the processes involved in arriving at the decision to knowingly and willingly sacrifice oneself in order to be true to one's convictions while it discloses less of the suffering and strife of imprisonment.",1301788800,,2916,4.846774193548387

Once again a story showing how the ""legal powers that be"" do not take into consideration the humanity especially when it comes to these drug crimes.

It was hard not to cry.  I walked away from the TV twice because the scene was so intense.  What I really liked about the movie is how it slowly reeled you in at just the right pace.

1002467,5,6305240019,"This 1998 drama took me by surprise.  I got completely involved in it.  My heart beat and I felt pangs of anxiety.  And I couldn't stop watching.

The film opens in Malaysia where three young American men are just plain having a good time.  There are wonderful beaches, lots of girls and plenty of hashish.  Then their vacation is over.  Two of them return home.  The third, Lewis, played by Joaquin Phoenix, decides to stay on and join a group that saves gorillas.

Fast forward now two years.  As none of these Americans knew each other too well, they have lost touch.  Enter Anne Heche.  She contacts both John, played by Vince Vaughn and David, played by Tony Croft.  She tells them she is Lewis' attorney.  The story is that right after the three men separated, Lewis was arrested for hashish possession.  It was such a large quantity that he is considered a drug trafficker;  the sentence is death.  He's been in a Malaysian jail all this time and the case has been under appeal.  But the appeals have run out, and Lewis is sentenced to die in just eight days.

However, if both John and David would return to Malaysia and each serve a 3-year sentence, Lewis' life would be saved.  If only one of the men return, the sentence would be six years.  But either way, Lewis would be allowed to live.  This is quite a dilemma.  And from that point on I knew that no matter how it turned out, it would not be a pleasant ending.  I couldn't help my real deep emotions that surfaced during this film.  What would I do if put into that situation?  A Malaysia prison is a horrible place.  And in case we don't get it, there are several scenes shot there.

This is a fine film.  It brings up questions of moral complexity.  There are no easy answers.

Yes, the acting is good, the cinematography just right.  But the thing that fascinated me the most was the story.  And isn't that what a good film is really about?",1164153600,2,1909,4.39367816091954

I think there should have been Oscar nod's all around! It really begs the question, would you do the same for another?

Separately, Joaquin Phoenix's--an Uber-talent--impassioned performance surely deserved an Oscar nomination. Those of you who have become Vince Vaughn fans due to his comic turns in such films as Be Cool, Wedding Crashers (let's face it he made the movie), and Starsky & Hutch, should view this movie. He's a fine dramatic actor as well. In fact, Mr. Vaughn is extremely verstaile and believable in any genre. Did you see ""Swingers""? Another good film treating us to Vince's complex movie characters. Anne Heche gets some good roles, and her acting was fine in this film. However, any good actor could have done the character justice. A fabulous actor good have given it teeth.

This is not a cliched story: Americans vacation overseas, disrespect a country by doing drugs, and get themselves in big trouble because of their ignorance of the law. This movie is more. It makes you think ""What are you (am I) made of?""

-Do you have integrity?

-Will blood or family bonds make you sacrifice that integrity?

-Can you be selfless?

-Can you endure extreme hardship and come out unscathed?

1002529,2,6305240019,"Granted, even the most potent of cinematic material seems to retain a certain propensity to stray from its current tangent into certain bouts of Hollywood-style cheesiness.  In some cases, such diversions amount to nothing more than a limited negation of the film's quality.  In Return to Paradise, however, this deviation translates into utter ruin.

Accordingly, the promising foundation of the film's story is effectively established in short order, as Lewis(Joaquin Phoenix) is arrested and sentenced for drug-trafficking on account of the untimely discovery of the cumulative amount of hashhish attributed to him and his two buddies, the latter of whom have since relocated to  New York to enjoy prominent lifestyles between them.  With less than 8 days remaining until the untimely execution of her client, Lewis' attorney (played to perfection by Anne Heche) attempts to utilize the allotted time period to persuade the accomplices to return to Malaysia, where they will each serve reduced sentences.

While Tony(Conrad) barely puts up an argument, Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) is considerably less susceptible to his own moral obligations, thus culminating in a series of increasingly heated and well-orchestrated disputes between himself and the devoted attorney.  While the collective performances of Conrad and Vaughn  qualify as dispensible cut-outs of aspiring personalities, Heche and Phoenix manage to breath  considerable degree of life into their respective cinematic alter-egos.  But alas, fine performances can only redeem so much.

The preliminary seeds of disaster are effectively planted at the half-way point as the persistent bickering between Vaughn and Heche suddenly gravitates into sexual intimacy, bad enough considering the complete lack of chemistry between the two characters and further destructive in the manner in which it compromises the film's moral dilemma.  From now on, any bout of sudden nobility on Sheriff's behalf could effectively be attributed, not to any genuine conscience of his own making, but to a growing incentive to please and possibly impress his new-found lover.  Some viewers may consider this development ""moving"", but in my book and in the context of the film's initially well-constructed premise, it simply qualifies as ""cheating"".

By this point, any remaining potential in the premise is effectively squandered into oblivion by the film's melodramatic conclusion, an emotionally-charged spectacle so overzealous and utterly contrived as to render the viewer disoriented.  In fact, so ridiculous is the last ten minutes that I actually burst out laughing as the last of the movie's built-up potential was effectively caste into ruin.

There are indeed worse movies out there, but considering the preliminary build-up of expectations, Return to Paradise certainly qualifies as the biggest let-down in recent memory.",1103241600,2,2869,5.621809744779583

Vince Vaughn's character Sheriff is easy to hate at first as the cocky, selfish guy, but his transformation is both very believable and very moving. If you need to see a movie about courage and doing the right thing in spite of the terrible consequences, this is the one.

1002532,4,6305240019,"This is a wonderfully creative movie, with top-notch directing and award caliber performances by a talented cast. The premise is a fairly simple one. Three young men, Sheriff (Vincent Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad), and Louis (Joaquin Phoenix), who previously didn't know one another, team up in Malaysia and party hearty. They have fun drinking, smoking hashish, and picking up girls. Sheriff and Tony head back to the states, leaving Louis behind, as he has a wildlife conservation idea involving orangutans that he wishes to pursue while in Malaysia. Before they go, Sheriff makes it a point to leave his dope stash in the house in which Louis is remaining. Later, the police come to search the premises on a matter unrelated to the dope stash. When they find it, however, they arrest Louis, who literally has been left holding the bag.
Two years later, Anne Heche enters the picture as a lawyer, ostensibly working on behalf of her client, Louis. She seeks out Sheriff and Tony with a proposition. It seems that while Sheriff and Tony have been getting on with their lives, Louis has been rotting in a Malaysian prison for the past two years and living in sheer terror. You see, Louis is scheduled to be executed in eight days as a drug dealer, as the amount of dope that had been left behind and discovered by the police was just over a threshold amount that would classify it as being for distribution, rather than for personal use. The only hope Louis has of staying alive is if Sheriff and Tony go back to Malaysia to take responsibility for their part in this and serve three years each. If only one returns, then the sole returnee faces six years. Will it be all for one and one for all? Will Louis live to personally thank his friends? Watch the movie and find out.
Vince Vaughn as Sheriff gives a compelling performance. Playing the quintessential Everyman, he struggles with his moral obligation. It is strictly a moral one, as legally he can just sit by and do nothing. Tony, too, undergoes some soul searching. They finally both come to the same conclusion, or do they? The dilemma that they face is an excruciatingly personal one. The movie builds up to a level of suspense that is totally unexpected. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. Meanwhile, Joaquin Phoenix, one of the finest young actors of his generation, gives a performance that will haunt the viewer for days. Anne Heche also give a noteworthy performance, intense and relentless in her quest to save what life Louis has left. Jada Pinkett also gives a strong performance as a news reporter who is interested in the story. Her interjection into the movie brings into the forefront the issue of the responsibility of the press. When you see this movie, you will understand what this means.
This film is excellent on all fronts. The only weakness was an unnecessary subplot, which involved a blossoming romance between Sheriff and the character played by Anne Heche. Were it not for this digression, I would have given the movie five stars. It is an otherwise profoundly moving film that deserves to be seen.",1041638400,33,3103,4.7481481481481485
1002533,4,6305240019,"This film was overlooked when it was released in 1998, and then it was virtually forgotten. That was unfortunate because ""Return to Paradise"" is a powerful (and powerfully acted) film. On the other hand, its neglect at the box office really wasn't much of a surprise; this is a serious film that doesn't allow viewers to walk away lightly, and it is therefore not the typical Hollywood escapist fare that moviegoers throng to week after week.
But if film, like all art, is about life then serious films about complicated subjects are needed and welcome from time to time, particularly if such films treat their subject matter with respect and thoughtfulness. Three friends vacation in Malaysia (with drugs, booze, and women), two return, and one stays behind, only to find himself imprisoned and sentenced to death for possessing drugs the three of them used. His death sentence will be overturned if the other two return and serve time in prison. A lawyer (played effectively by Anne Heche) contacts the two men and tries to convince them to return.
A serious subject, indeed, but it's the way in which the film is acted, directed, and handled that make it so touching and provocative. The film's greatest achievement is the way in which it makes the moral dilemma faced by the characters so palpably real and so powerfully complicated. It doesn't tread lightly or simplify, nor does it overburden the film with tedious, needless moralizing or cliched rhetoric. It's moral tone is spot on; it is heavy, to be sure, but you appreciate it because you, as a viewer, feel the weight as much as the characters do.
""Return to Paradise"" is also stellar because it centers on cultural differences and moral responsibility without being morally relativistic (relativistic, by the way, is how most Hollywood movies would handle such a subject). The film exposes the complexities of circumstance without making the story confusing, just as it approaches the entire story in the most balanced and judicious way. This is not a far-fetched situation (Kenneth Turan of the LA Times thought otherwise, but I disagree); in fact, it's the type of moral dilemma many have faced in their lives (not the exact situation, but the consequences of mistakes, the dilemma of deciding what to do in the midst of a painfully serious situation). This is a film based not so much on plot as it is on ethical debate.
The acting is superb. Joaquin Phoenix's jailed, wounded Lewis is an outstanding portrayal of a soul that has withered under the weight of its situation. Anne Heche's Beth Easton is both fortitudinous and fragile. But it's Vince Vaughn's ""Sheriff"" that steals the show, as we witness a man who gradually evolves from careless to morally responsible -- and it's entirely believable.
Ultimately, as we find out towards the end of the film, ""Return to Paradise"" is deeply humane (even in its suggestive cynicism). Sheriff does something for Lewis that virtually makes up for his past mistakes, that gives meaning to Lewis's deeply pointless and helpless misery, and that proves just how morally courageous Sheriff has become (I can't describe it without explaining the film's ending, but it inolves Sheriff yelling to Lewis through a cell window).
Overall, a well-made film. Just be sure you have much lighter, happier fare in your DVD collection for a healthy balance.",1028505600,4,3352,4.9555950266429845
1002550,5,6305240019,"What a beautiful and painful movie...
We find three young friends in (I believe) Malaysia living the easy life. Soon though, they are parted and what ensues is one of the more original and touching stories of recent times. Joaquin Phoenix's character stays behind as the other two (including Vince Vaughn) return to America. But soon Vaughn learns that Phoenix has been imprisoned for drugs and sentenced to a horrific judgement. Vaughn must chose whether to help his friend by sharing the burden, which he's guilty of, or letting Phoenix suffer the dire consequence.
Joaquin Phoenix is one of those actors fortunate enough to have never suffered teen flicks and empty plots. Every movie he's done has been intriguing and innovative. As an actor he may be the best in his age range. Here, you will find such agonizing deepths of pain in his portrayal of ""Lewis"", a doomed man, that you may have to turn your head or cry. Every person I've shown the film to cries. Phoenix is almost too real to watch in his closing scenes. One could ponder if he used the pain over losing brother River Phoenix so tragically, to bring up the emotions for that moment. Any one scene with Joaquin Phoenix during the film is worth seeing the whole movie. It only helps then, that Vince Vaughn breaks his usual stride of good acting to dig deeper and give possibly his best performance to date. Anne Heche is also exquisite. The film's only downfall (only a slight one) is the romance between Vaughn and Heche. Though NOTHING could draw attention away from Phoenix's brilliance, the Vaugh/Heche romance doesn't have purpose and seems to slightly soften the impact of a film which could've (and I think should've) hit even harder without it.
The point here is that while the story is fascinating, Phoenix is blindingly heart-wrenching and brings this film to an entirely different level. No young living  actor could've played the scene better, or even as good. And fortunatley, the story itself is great enough, that the film isn't just a showcase of Phoenix's genius, but an overall quality film and a must see for all.",1006041600,2,2099,4.78236914600551

1002552,4,6305240019,"""Return To Paradise"" begins a little slow, but gains momentum as the film progresses. The main character (Vince Vaughn) is faced with a life altering decision: whether or not to give up a part of his life to save the life of a friend. We're treated to a wide array of conflicts including honesty versus deceit, caring versus apathy, love versus self-gratification, and guilt versus innocence. These emotional conflicts provide the twists and turns and thought provoking impact of ""Return To Paradise,"" and fragment the viewer's concentration (not unlike that of the characters) on the key question: will Vince Vaughn do one honorable thing in his life which is not in his own self-interest?
Despite the fact that the film doesn't travel from beginning to end in a direct line, we know the answer to the question ""Does the Bad Guy become the Good Guy""? Acting is first-rate, and often makes one forget flaws in the story line. The slow unveiling of Vaughn's identity is excellent.
I would have preferred that the film had left out the relationship between Vaughn and Heche. I found their romance unrealistic, and an unnecessary and distracting subplot.

The well expressed and obvious themes were definetly about self-asessment and morals, but I think something that the movie makers and definetly the actors wanted people to think about was the media's relentless pursuit of a story and their blunt exploitation. There might have been a slightly exaggerated instance in this movie for cinematic effect, which was expressed well, but there are many all too real examples in real life that I think maybe if the media were non-existant the repetitiveness of actions or conclutions of events might have been dramatically altered. A few examples come easily to mind; paparazzi, school shootings, trial coverages, every ""top story"" on the news. It all has something, if not everything to do with the media. There was a well written case in this movie. I felt some of the actors pushed a little too hard to deliver their lines, and the attraction of Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche's characters was unimaginable, but it's all a matter of circumstance and I certainly couldn't have done better myself. Joaquin Phoenix delivered the stand out performance, convincingly portraying an isolated, insane captive. I loved the gritty, disgusted feeling I was left with in the end which is something you can't always expect from the hollywood backwash plaguing theaters. Life doesn't always turn out good, and sometimes a movie with that sort of expression is a nice change of pace.

1002555,5,6305240019,"How such a quality film could pass unnoticed by critics and audiences is beyond my comprehension. Before seeing this film by chance one night on a movie channel, I had only a vague and nebulous recollection of this film, something along the lines of, ""I remember Anne Heche in the trailer...some dramatic music going on, I think, and set in Malaysia or Thailand."" Admittedly, I did not expect to be affected by the film; rather, I expected an average drama that I would forget about even before I went to bed. However, this film has made me think twice about discounting films so quickly.
I will not summarise the film, as many reviewers here have already done so, but I will add my two cents to recommend such an extraordinary piece of work that illustrates Hollywood's ability to still churn out quality films (albeit without the pomp and circumstance of a typical $100 million budget studio film).
The first thing I noticed was the performance given by Anne Heche (Beth), Vince Vaughn (Sheriff), and Joaquin Phoenix (Lewis). Deep emotion was infused in the most simple lines exchanged between two characters, be it at a construction site or a dingy New York apartment. The film goes straight to the point. We are given but some short glimpses of a vivacious and happy Lewis before we are thrown into the moral dilemma - will Sheriff go back to save his friend's life? It seems unlikely that audiences would sympathise with Lewis, as we, the audience, and Sheriff barely know Lewis. The fact that we do sympathise deeply with Lewis clearly demonstrates Phoenix's exceptional acting skills. Also, Heche and Vaughn, although ultimately involved in a relationship (which I deemed to be necessary), make every scene and word believable. As the movie begins we all wonder why Beth, the desperate lawyer, is so dedicated to Lewis. I did not expect my wonder to be appeased, but it was. I won't spoil the surprise.
Quite telling that I haven't forgotten about this film since I first saw it, as I have watched many films without being at all impressed or touched. There are several touching scenes throughout the film, but I will point out the most astounding:
* Lewis's taped outpouring while in the Malaysian prison. Whilst begging Sheriff to return to Malaysia, Lewis is also stating his own guilt for asking, incredibly trying to be humble about asking for his life.
* Lewis' digression in the prison, his stream of consciousness speech that is perhaps my most favourite scene in the entire movie. Joaquin Phoenix, although his own worst critic who always sees flaws in his performances, cannot possibly not see the beauty in his acting, especially in this scene. Give Joaquin his Oscar statuette now!
* Spoiler, so I won't go into detail. But it's the ending. Enough said.
If you want big explosives, vapid lines like ""it's time to meet your doom,"" or big sequences of impressive special effects, you will not get them here; for, this is a film that thrives purely from the strength of the actors, the quality of the script, and the remarkable scenes. This is not to say this is a film for the few people who dig boring dramas, and this is by no means an art house film. It is to say, however, that this is a film filled with touches of humour, intense drama, romance, and moral crossroads. If I had to sum this film up in one word, it would be ""haunting.""",979171200,4,3356,4.699490662139219
1002556,5,6305240019,"This movie still haunts me a month later, or rather, Joaquin Phoenix's performance does, especially Lewis's eerie monologue towards the end of the show. I thought he was a good actor before ""Return..."", but after watching i can safely say his acting is amazingly brilliant. The movie is deep, it makes you re-think your whole take on morality. I think it deserved more recognition it'd received (if any at all), and Joaquin should have gotten at least an oscar nomination for best supporting actor. The movie would be perfect, but the ridiculous love interest between Vince Vaughn's character (who was also totally believable) and Anne Heche's character soured the plot. even my mom agreed it was unbelievable.

But anyway go rent this movie because Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn, and especially Joaquin Phoenix are magical. It starts out with 3 friends, Sheriff, Tony, and Lewis, and it ends in a stunning climax. It's more than a story about a guy who got caught for marijuana, and had to have his friends come back to malaysia to dig him out, it's a story about morals, and I'm sure a bunch of people like that. I can honestly say that this is Vince's best role, and one of Joaquins must have flicks!",975369600,,697,4.287878787878788

1002559,4,6305240019,"Although this movie wasn't a box office hit (hey, maybe that just means it's probably good), it is truly a film worth watching. I already knew the ending before I actually watched ""Return to Paradise"", so I was robbed of the suspense that makes the movie even better. The acting was great. Joaquin Phoenix is frighteningly good in his role. There really aren't any words to describe what he does on screen in this movie. Vince Vaughn gives a wonderfully well acted and thoughtful performance. They are my favorite actors for a reason. It is obvious from this movie that they are talented and underappreciated. I only had one complaint as I was watching-- the love story really diluted the message of this movie and seemed tacked on and out of place. I would have thought this movie was perfection without it. ""Return to Paradise"" is really a movie worth watching, if only for the question it asks. Would you do the right thing, even if it had the potential to ruin your life?",970272000,,975,4.609195402298851

I found myself aching and wrenching along with each character, feeling involved in the inner struggle each character faced in fighting for Lewis or making THE decision. I, of  course, found myself asking if ""I had it in me.""  ""Return..."" is filled with profound symbolism on many levels,  teaches hard to accept real-life lessons, and forces rarely asked moral  questions upon the watcher.  Make sure the tissues are handy for this one.  I cried---sobbed would be more accurate--during and long after this movie.  I am sure this movie will be with me for a long time to come.  My small  objection to this movie was the romantic aspect, especially the romantic  outcome. I feel the way in which the romantic outcome was portrayed,  especially the timing of it, undermined the powerful story and profound  ending. EXCELLENT movie, despite the objection.

1002642,4,6305240019,"this movie has good actors, a moving story, scenes that you will be thinking about a long time and a real shocking and unexpected ending. but for me, this movie has one big problem: there is really nothing much  happening during the entire middle of the movie. anne heche tries to make  vince vaughn (who acts really good) ""return to paradise"" to save  the life of louis. this takes over an hour to take place and isn't as much  interesting, shocking, thoughtful or anything as the great and unsuspected  ending is. it's really sad and will leave you thinking. but I think you  should not judge the malaysia by seeing this movie ( I don't think it is  intended to make you do it ).",959472000,,681,4.4
1002643,3,6305240019,"An extremely intriguing movie is 'Return to Paradise'. This movie seemed  to skip the cinemas here and went straight to video, for reasons unknown.  This was recommended to me after seeing 'Brokedown Palace' but this is a  much better movie. This movie will make you think, and will leave you  thinking days after. What would you do in a situation where you had to  choose 3 years in prison, or the loss of a friend. One criticism here, is  that the film should have presented the friends as 3 school buddies who  were getting together for all times sake. It would have had much more  impact. In the movie they only knew the guy (Phoenix) for 5 weeks. The film  does have a few weaknesses such as the love affair between Heche and  Vaughn. That spoilt it in a way as it stole the true importance of the  movie. Why does Hollywood think they need a love affair in every movie?  Heche would have been too wound up about her brother to be thinking of  things like that - afterall, the countdown had truly begun - only days to  go until her brother was to be hung. Aside from these issues, we have a  film that is worth viewing and contains brilliant performances by all cast  members especially by Anne Heche. The movie really did deserve cinema  exposure.",958953600,,1253,4.425438596491228

1002649,5,6305240019,"I actually saw this in the theatre when it was released. This is an amazing movie. Don't pay attention to the review ""Go back to Film School"". Some people are a little over analytical and should just  watch the news for their entertainment. Remember, a movie is just that, a  movie, a story. Return to Paradise is a thought provoking and highly  emotional STORY, a combination of which is exactly what I seek from films.  If I leave the theatre and all I can muster is ""Wow"", then I know  I just got my money's worth. Not only could I not speak for a while, I was  in a complete daze. My boyfriend and I talked about the movie for hours  afterwards, once I was able to Return to Reality. You become completely  involved with these characters. That is, if your not too busy analyzing  every second of each scene waiting for imperfections to arise. I have to  say the most phenomonal acting was done by Joaquin Phoenix. I just cannot  believe the Academy and the Hollywood Foreign Press overlooked this film  altogether. Politics I am sure. We wouldn't want anyone/Malaysia to get mad  at us. Better to just ignore that film. Bottom line, I thought this movie  was fabulous. Some may disagree, but that's totally fine. Most of you  however, I think will be moved, shocked, depressed, confused and amazed  after watching this movie. Then ask yourself what would you do? REALLY. If  you answer too quickly then your not being truthful. It takes some thought.",948844800,6,1454,4.595330739299611
1002650,5,6305240019,"A film for grown-ups (which is a rare thing).  Beautifully made, beautifully acted, directed with subtlety and intelligence.  Does the fact that you've forgotten someone and moved on with your life mean that  you love them any less, or that your responsibility or accountability to  them is any less, years later?  Are the responsibilities of  friendship contingent upon how long you've known that friend, or upon how  long it's been since you've seen that friend?  The acting and direction  are so authentic that I felt like I was watching a documentary rather than  a work of fiction.  A film about loyalty, decency, friendship, and about  ""how you act when no one's looking.""  It's about an unremarkable  ""regular Joe"" who is asked/forced to address the questions:  What  kind of a person am I, really?  Am I a person who can be counted on by his  friends?  to what extent?  Is there anything more important than myself and  my life?  To what extent is a totally undistinguished person capable of  acts of transcendent nobility?  What is the meaning of friendship?  What  rights does friendship confer upon someone to make really extraordinary  requests or demands of his friends?  Does the essential decency or goodness  of one person have an affect on those around him?  Do the responsibilities  of love (i.e. loyalty) diminish after years of not seeing each other?  Is  love eternal and internal, or specific to a time and place?  Is  decency/goodness infectious/contagious?  One of the best movies I've  ever seen.

But after a few minutes, it was clear I was helplessly in its grip. This film goes to the heart of what it means to be a ""moral"" person, and what rewards--or punishments--there might be waiting for he who decides upon a course of goodness. It shows people who are not perfect having to make the most heart-wrenching moral choices, and in so doing ennobles all of us who are not heroes. This is not to say it is a dreary, moralistic tome. No, there's humor, there's action, there's even sex--because above all there are real people here. It is precisely that fact which makes this film impossible to turn off, and extraordinarily difficult to stop thinking about. You simply need this film. Buy it on DVD. Keep it in your collection.
