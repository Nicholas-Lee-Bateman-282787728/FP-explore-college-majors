8380809,5,B002TZS5MO,"If you like to watch things blow up or not, this is a great series.  The art and science of implosion are shown in great detail by folks in the field and professorial experts.  What I really liked is that they showed an attempt that was NOT successful; you hardly see a reality show be that real.  I watched one episode and could not stop watching!  Subsequently I purchased a copy for my dad for Father's Day.  Why get a Dad a tie when he can watch things explode, right?",1369958400,3,472,4.2
8380810,5,B002TZS5MO,"My husband is an engineer so naturally likes this show. To me, it is over my head as they are formulating how to destruct old buildings and structures. This is a great show for him. Perhaps the time slot was bad or the show had a really narrow audience since it was cancelled after a few episodes.",1359244800,2,297,4.228070175438597
