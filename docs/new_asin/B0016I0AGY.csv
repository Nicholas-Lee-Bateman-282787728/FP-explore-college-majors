3156900,3,B0016I0AGY,"I am a diehard Dallas fan and I was so excited to get this season.  I think it is one of the more glamorous and exciting seasons of the entire series.  I love this season very much, however the product quality itself was disappointing.  The episodes The Prize and En Passant simply refused to play altogether, and a few other episodes paused and skipped a lot.  This has not happened with any of the other seasons I have purchased over the years.  This was so frustrating, and is not becoming of an excellent show like Dallas.  I sadly had to return it.  I will purchase this season again hopefully soon.",1459123200,,604,4.4363636363636365

3156907,3,B0016I0AGY,"I purchased the complete series. Previous seasons were recorded three episodes to a side, but this one went up to four, and that means they had to boost the compression or reduce resolution. And it shows.

As to the story, it was mostly decent, but had a few fails. Jamie is injured and needs a blood transfusion, but only Jack has the right blood. She's AB-, which, according to my college bio teacher, means she can accept blood from everybody except those with the Rh factor (+). Getting Rh+ blood would be bad for her, but not getting blood with A and B antigens should have no effect on her.",1451779200,,596,4.418181818181818

3156931,5,B0016I0AGY,"This is the best season in years of the show, have to keep remembering its all a dream. My somewhat unpopular opinion (from what I've seen) is that the first Four seasons of the series were the best ever. The unpopular part, is that seasons Five, Six and Seven were pretty boring. Season 7 got exciting the last 6 episodes (When Clayton's sister Jessica, Played by Alexis Smith comes) and then season Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve were all pretty good. I have seen some say that season 9 -12 are unwatchable, i disagree, i haven't finished season 9 yet, however I'm 12 episodes in and its more interesting than past seasons. I think i like some of the later years of the show better than the middle years is because of the different storylines, a little more melodrama, which some people think is cheesy, sometimes it is, but nonetheless its entertaining. Season 9, Pam finally has an attractive hairstyle for the first time since season 4, Sue Ellen is finally getting over her alcoholism and J.R is finally facing some adversities. Seasons 8 -12 had more going on besides back and forth crooked oil deals and Sue Ellen getting drunk. Though new characters came in and left, and original characters left. with flaws, i think season 8 -12 still had some really interesting moments, that 5, 6 and 7 really lacked. I think Jamie should have stayed on the rest of the show as Cliff's wife. I liked Afton, but Jaimie had more personality. I don't get why the writers had to get everyone together and break everyone up after a season or two. Jack Ewing was somewhat useless, besides season 9's Angelica Nero plot line. And even though he was an original, I don't think the show needed Bobby. Sometimes he bugged me with his occasional holier than thou attitude. And i think Pam was much better with Mark Graison, whom she marries in this dream season, but afterward its all erased, so he really was dead all along and she is still going to remarry Bobby in season 10. It can all be a bit confusing. I always liked Lucy, however the writers never came up with anything more for her, besides liking a guy, Which got really lame. If only she could have stayed all the way through with interesting stuff to do. They bring her back at the end of season 11 throughout 12 and 13 for more sitting around. until she finally leaves near the end of the 13th season. For anyone who is interested in this series, my obvious advice would to start from the very beginning, the 1978 episodes, some complete seasons aren't THAT vital like season 5 or 6. but still important to watch in order. So you won't be confused because each season is different.",1419811200,,2635,4.53781512605042

3156938,1,B0016I0AGY,When I got this there are 4 disk in the season. the 2nd 2 epesodes on each disk did not play at all. so I was forced to buy those 4 episodes from amazon instant viewing to see them at $1.99 each.,1412640000,,195,3.6666666666666665
3156939,5,B0016I0AGY,"Despite this entire season being a figment of Pam's imagination, I found it very enjoyable. Certainly more watchable than Dallas' last 2 seasons. Whether it was Bobby's absence or competition from Miami Vice, this season slipped from #2-#6 in the ratings. Most would agree that this season of Dallas was trying to follow in Dynasty's footsteps. You can thank executive producer Philip Capice for that. This was the first time Capice got involved with the writing of Dallas, where as Lenny Katzman had been involved in the previous 8 seasons. Katzman left at the end of season 8 to direct a new show on the east coast. It lasted only one season, & thanks to Larry Hagman Katzman returned and became executive producer in season 10. Rumor has it Capice was offered a million dollars to leave Dallas. One way or the other Philip Capice was gone for good.
  As far as story lines are concerned, I really enjoyed the Anjelica Nero plot. She always had something up her sleeve, and JR could never figure out what it was. I really enjoyed Ray & Donna's ordeal they went through with having to cope with a mentally challenged baby, then the miscarriage, then deciding to adopt a deaf boy who crawled into their hearts. Donna was a favorite character of mine, and I hated to see her gone the following season. Jenna's pretty much a basket case this entire season. At first she managed to cope with Bobby's death but eventually started blaming herself for all the circumstances involving his death. Sue Ellen's drunken, desperate housewife act was starting to wear thin from previous seasons. It was a nice change to see her pick herself up, remain sober, & become a part of the working class. I guess Pam's wild goose chase in season 8 wasn't a total waste. Mark Graison was alive and returned as Pam's fianc. Mark explains his cancer was in remission, and Pam decides she doesnt want Mark to spend the rest of his life alone, so she accepts his proposal. They finally tied the knot in the season finale. Speaking of Pam and Mark, perhaps the least -liked story line was the emerald mine in Colombia. Even Victoria herself said it was her least favorite of all Dallas' story lines involving Pam. The last few episodes of season 9 seemed to be surreal. Everybody seemed to get along so well. Ray & Donna reconciled and adopted a son. Sue Ellen & JR were happier than ever. Cliff, who had married Jamie for business reasons in season 8, was very much in love with her this season. It all seemed like a dream that all these characters who were at odds with each other at the end of season 8 were living happily ever after. Perhaps that's because it was a dream. Season 10 picked up where season 8 left off. Mark Graison is never mentioned again, so we are to assume either he died in that plane crash, or he was in one of those clinics and succumbed to his illness. Ray and Donna remained separated, & of course Sue Ellen and JR were living separate lives. Most Dallas fans would agree this is when the show 'jumped the shark.' Perhaps they're right because the ratings never recovered. Season 9 fell to #6 and season 10 fell to #11. Despite the controversy, this season is still very watchable unlike the last 3. Enjoy.",1410048000,,3208,4.558058925476603

3156946,3,B0016I0AGY,"After the heart-wrenching final minutes of Season 8, the storm settles into a gentle rain. But, of course, this is DALLAS, and any quietness that occurs is merely an illusion, and it's doubly true in this case. There is one storyline in particular that I liked from this season: Donna with the special needs children. Mark's return, however, I did NOT like. That is one reason I'm glad this season and the final 15 minutes of Season 8 are (somewhat awkwardly) explained away as a dream.

The second reason: Even though I received this season in the condition Used-Very Good, the episodes J.R. Rising, and Blast From The Past would not play, and only the last 10-15 minutes of Serendipity would play. I find that really odd, as there was no indication that there were scratches on the discs.

For the reasons enumerated above, I give this season of DALLAS III stars.

A shadow has fallen over DALLAS, which does not lift until the end and the first few minutes of Season 10, albeit very awkwardly.",1402963200,,996,4.6477272727272725

3156951,2,B0016I0AGY,"This season has been confusing on so many levels.  Hair colors and styles would change from episode to episode.  SueEllen started out a reddish brown and now she is gray or blonde.  JR would flunctuate between gray and black.  The haircuts would change from scene to scene.  Everybody is now extremely wealthy; there are literally no working class people on the show anymore.

One odd thing was the tightness of Dack Rambo's pants.  I even looked him up because his pants were so tight and found out he was gay.  It really is obvious on the show because the writers wouldn't even let him kiss or make out with any woman on the show, even though he is the hottest guy on the show.

Angelica stands out like a sore thumb; she is some sort of European trying to do business with Ewing oil; she seems like a caricature of a villian or something; like somebody you would see on SCOOBY DOO.

Jenna is losing her mind.  Ray and Donna are volunteering with special needs children.  Ms. Ellie is back (THANK GOODNESS) and Sue Ellen is working (THANK GOODNESS).  SueEllen and JR are fighting or reconciling or whatever.  Pam has been kidnapped and returns unaffected.

The whole season has been like a puzzle; you basically had to try to put together the storylines yourself.

Pros and Cons of this season:

PROS:
1. SueEllen has a job and has a life outside of JR and Southfork and, as a result, JR has developed a level of respect towards her that wasn't evident in past seasons.

2. Donna and Rae are finally building a house that a wealthy couple would live in.  The Donna actress even commented to producers that it made no sense for the KREBBS to be hanging clothes on the line when they are millionaires

3. Ellie is back and her grandmother demeanor and clothes is a pleasant contrast to all the glamour and over dressing that takes place on the show

4. Cliff actually has a wife with a brain, Jamie.

5. JR actually seems to be showing love towards SueEllen

CONS:
1. Jack- Dack Rambo is hot, but it is clear that he is uncomfortable with the women on the show and uncomfortable with his storyline or lack thereof

2. JR became a wuss this season.  Many betrayed him and he did nothing.  SueEllen ends up on skid row and afterwards he decides he can't live without her and leaves his girlfriend for her.  The old JR would have left Mandy, got a new girlfriend, and then pretended to be with SueEllen

3. Mark Grayson, Matt, and Pam - I just don't see the point of them being on the show

4. Jenna and Charlie - I just didn't see the point of them being on the show

5. Ben - this guy doesn't even try to pretend he is not creepy; he is outwardly creepy

The worst part of the show, however, is

#6. Angelica and Grace - they were pretentious Europeans who didn't even fit in with the show at all.",1394755200,,2796,4.358527131782946
3156952,5,B0016I0AGY,"Ok so my wife and I are going back in time and watching all of these, we love them. Just becareful because you sit to watch them and then 5 hours just went by.",1394409600,,159,3.7058823529411766
3156953,3,B0016I0AGY,"This season is ridiculous and not Dallas at all. The writers turned JR into a wimp. Sue Ellen's drinking was way out of control. The whole Angelica Nero plot was absurd! JR giving up Mandy waiting for Sue Ellen to come back to him; that would never happen. Cliff and Jamie's relationship please!
Should be seen to see how a bad producer (Phil Caprice) can truly ruin a great hit show. And how Leonard Katzman fixed everything and brought the true Dallas back in Season 10.
Still enjoyed the acting between Linda Gray and Larry HAGMAN; truly a great pair!

3156959,4,B0016I0AGY,"I never watched Dallas when it originally aired......My grandma watched EVERY single prime time soap that was on. Knots Landing was her favorite, followed by Dallas. Later in life I recorded every episode on soapnet of both Dallas and Knots. I decided to watch them BOTH from the beginning to see what all the fuss was about back then. I can say now that I have seen every single episode of both shows and both shows are just fantastic and very powerful, even to this day. It just seems so ODD not having to WAIT. Watching over a decade's worth of shows in a year was just kind of ODD, but a BLAST not having to wait.

Last season with Donna Reed was, to me and others I know, what the real Miss Ellie should be.  She was an attractive older woman who can act, dressed attractively but appropriately, and was just so real.  Barbara Bel Geddes has spent all these prior seasons lumbering about in ugly, colorless sack dresses not worthy of Jock Ewing's wife, staring off into space and seldom looking anyone in the eye as she drones her lines, and every once in a while she drawls ""Jayyyyy  Ahhhhhh,"" to J.R. or referring to him. To see her return in this season nine was the biggest let down for me.  Of course I knew she would be back, I'm old enough to remember watching the entire series on television. But the let down was no less because of that. I recommend buying this season for any true Dallas fans who want to own the whole series and make it complete, but to sit and watch it all as a dream -- I didn't do it.

It was especially sad to see that the whole storyline with Ray and Donna losing their Downs Syndrome baby and then adopting Tony, never happened.  ALL the characters had come so far in this season, that it didn't even seem worth it just to have Bobby back.  Of course, we all know how famous this ""dream season"" is in the history of television, but looking back, it really is a shame that some of the stories and arcs couldn't have been continued in the coming seasons.

3156981,3,B0016I0AGY,"**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**

Season 9 of ""Dallas"" ran on CBS during the 1985-86 TV season and has becomes infamous as the ""dream season"" in which Bobby turns up in the shower in the finale negating everything that has transpired in the past 31 episodes.

Patrick Duffy's departure becomes the death knell for the series as it never fully recovers. Even the return of Barbara Bel Geddes can't reverse the trend.

""Special Guest Star"" Barbara Carrera is a colossal bore as the exotic Angelica Nero, who works for a Greek shipping magnate and has a special interest in cousin Jack (Dack Rambo) who bears a strong resemblance to the ailing tycoon of Marinos Shipping. This is one of the most boring plots ever on ""Dallas"" and Carrera seems better suited to ""Dynasty"" with her gold lame gowns, capes and turbans overpowering every scene she's in.

J.R. is less sadistic this season and seems to be softening a bit. When he learns of Mandy's betrayal, how does he punish her? By personally handing her the title to the deluxe condo, that's how! If Afton had done the same thing a few seasons back, he would have kicked her to the curb faster than you can say ""offshore drilling"". J.R. does put the screws to the cartel once again, and he and Sue Ellen start another custody battle for John Ross but it's all a big case of ""been-there-done-that"".

Pam discovers Mark Graison (John Beck) still alive, having staged his death earlier, and the two decide to marry. Pam also jumps ship from Barnes-Wentworth for Ewing Oil when she inherits Bobby's shares. The reading of the will is one of the season's best scenes.

Dack Rambo assumes the ""good-guy"" role vacated by Duffy but is a poor substitute, and teaming him with Priscilla Presley, easily the worst actress on the show, does him no favours. The writers even unsuccessfully try and play him up to the audience, with dialogue like ""women just flock to him"".

Deborah Shelton is still on board as J.R.'s mistress Mandy Winger and continues to underwhelm, though she's not as annoying as Jenna and daughter Charlie (they aren't even related by marriage, so why are they living at Southfork?).

Even Jamie (Jenilee Harrison) has become dull this season, spending a good portion of it in a sick-bed after marrying Cliff and suffering a workplace accident. Her survival depends on locating a rare blood type, but will a donor be found in time?

Marc Singer appears as Bobby's old pal Matt Cantrell who needs Pam to help finance his emerald-mining operation in Columbia. Pam accompanies him there and ends up being kidnapped in the jungle. Singer's Beastmaster body and 9th-grade-nerd voice make for an odd combination and the only really interesting thing about this plotline is it also features Alejandro Rey (""The Flying Nun"") as a corrupt Columbian police chief.

Steve Forrest appears as new mature ranch hand Ben Stivers, who seems to have a keen interest in Miss Ellie for some reason. This storyline doesn't really blossom until next season.

Clayton tries to keep his financial problems from Miss Ellie, but she finds out and secretly starts buying up the companies he's trying to unload.

There are only two storylines that make this season worthwhile. Donna learns she's pregnant, but that the child has Down's syndrome (her reaction scene is perhaps Susan Howard's best work on the series), and she and Ray agonize over making the right decision. Sue Ellen hits rock bottom and ends up swilling cheap wine on skid row with derelicts in her designer duds before she's committed once again to a sanitarium. Linda Gray gives a no-holds barred performance during her freak-out scenes in the drunk tank and hospital. They're definitely the highlight of the season. (One of the hookers asks her mockingly ""What'ya starin' at honey? My slip showin'?""). Another hilarious moment occurs when Sue Ellen wakes up in a sleazy, roach-trap of a motel room and tells the cleaning lady, straight-faced ""I'd like to have a Bloody Mary sent up""). With some help from the returning Dusty (Jared Martin), Sue Ellen turns her life around and gets a job as fundraiser for Mark Graison's medical research center, becoming involved with her boss, Dr. Kenderson.

Once again, we get dual-sided discs. The picture quality is very good and the episodes all contain the original 80s Lorimar closing logo. *Trivia Note* Episode #23 ""Sitting Ducks"" was directed by Susan Howard (Donna Krebbs).

While many fans made a big stink about Donna Reed in Season 8, THIS is the first season of ""Dallas"" that made me hold my nose. Completists and fans of Donna Krebbs and Sue Ellen will want to see this for some of their best moments, others should just be like Pam and pretend it was all a lousy bad dream and skip this one.",1325116800,,4750,4.8122699386503065

***** SPOILERS****

THE PROS

1) For the first time in the entire series, every character has an interesting storyline to deal with. In previous seasons, at least one, sometimes two, major character(s) was (were) a bit left aside, only supporting the others. It was often the case with Sue Ellen at the beginning, then alternatively Miss Ellie, Ray or Pam, then Bobby after the end of the fight for Ewing Oil (which caused P. Duffy's, who got bored by the role, temporary departure).
This time, EVERYONE (with the possible exception of Jenna Wade) have strong issues to deal with and have to stretch their personality out of their usual limits. Special mention to Linda Gray/Sue Ellen whose part is truly memorable and acting job amazing. The storyline of Ray and Donna is extremely intense too, which was rarely the case in previous seasons.
Anoter good point: second-hand characters this time have real weight. Subplots are all here for a reason, they are well entangled with the main action. Special mention for the love affair between Jack and Grace. Grace's character, the hot and the cold (the cold THEN the hot) was a treat. And very well played, by an actress who didn't just rely on her beauty.

2) For the first time ever too, there's no release of the dramatic intensity throughout the season. During previous seasons, numerous episodes were mere transition episodes. Sometimes there were 8 or 10 filler-ups in a rank, which could cause a certain humdrum and loss of the viewer's interest. Seasons 7 and 8 were very disappointing in this regard. No such thing here. Only 2 or 3 episodes may be considered as pure transition episodes. They were necessary to release the pressure caused by the main plots (Mark's resurrection, the Marinos scam, Pam's kidnapping in Columbia, Sue Ellen's descent to hell, Donna's accident, etc.). During season 9, the necessary transition phases are craftfully melted with the intense phases. Some characters re-catch their breath while others are in the eye of the storm, alternatively. Hence the action never bogs down, but no episode leaves a feeling of ""Hey, that's too much now!"". ""Dallas"" was, and always remained, a family entertainment.

3) For the first time ever, JR faces a first-hand villain, smart and dangerous like him, probably even more. This had only be the case, with a much lesser extent, with the character of Jeremy Wendell before (it will be FULLY the case with Wendell later). Angelica Nero was a great incarnation of evil. For the first time, JR does not lead the game, he has to think fast and anticipate on the blows. For sure he has to play defense for most of the season (which is why most of Dallas' fans and apparently Larry Hagman himself didn't like the season), but he does it well, he's as smart and tough as always, and, in the end, he strikes back - and brilliantly. I don't think Mr Hagman should despise his part in this season, he's flamboyant throughout all his relationship with angelica Nero, and very touching with his son or Sue Ellen. No shame to have about all that's been done. The character didn't become the good guy of the series (thank Lord!), here he's a shark facing a different kind of shark, maybe a little more human than usual on the surface (with Sue Ellen, Pam and Jack), but only on the surface.

4) The writers and producers tried an audacious change of scope with this season, taking out ""Dallas"" out of the city limits, which is considered as another bad point by most fans because it seemed to be a way of surfing on the ""Dynasty"" trend. Well - let's think of it! After 8 years of action taking place in the same geographical area, do you think a single city and a single state (even Texas) can provide enough material for a soap opera like this one? ""Dallas"" had started to repeat itself during season 8: legal affairs, broken marriages, long-time rivalities between families and between men... ""Dallas"" had to make a step into the unknown, which it did. I agree it couldn't reproduce over-the-top plots like the Marinos affair of the Columbia mines every year (although the B.D. Calhoun's during season 10 is something too), but what was done had to be done, and it was well done.

THE CONS

Of course, the flaws of season 9 are numerous. They are well known, just report to the other reviews. The main one, in my opinion, is the recurring lacks of coherence. What makes Angelica Nero think that her scam will succeed and that nobody who knew Jack Ewing will claim it's him who died in Martinique and not Dimitri Marinos? Why does JR hires a private eye to get some info on Marinos, and later doesn't care what he has become and why his report hasn't arrived? Why does Pam accept to step into Bobby's steps at Ewing Oil and spend half his day working with a man she despises? Why does Sue Ellen, in the end of the season, falls in love like a teenager for a man who brought her near self-destruction at the beginning? Why does Pam dream of a man (Ben Stivers) she has never met before and who will appear (as Wes Parmalee) during season 10? She's never been very witty before, so it's hard to imagine she has some sort of psychic abilites...

Another bad point in my opinion is the sad destiny of Jack Ewing / Dack Rambo. Rambo did some very good job replacing Bobby as the good guy. Too bad the producers decided to write him off the story during season 10 because of Patrick Duffy's return. Althoug I have no problem with P. Duffy returning, nor with the fact that this entire season had all been a dream, I do have some with the fact that all storylines developped during season 9 had to be reconsidered and reorientated brutally at the beginning of season 10. It was sometimes sad for the characters (especially Ray and Donna, who were close to have found happiness), and, in the case of Dack Rambo and John Beck, for the actors themselves.

Anyway, to me this season was a masterpiece of invention and energy. For those who haven't seen it, don't panic: it IS ""Dallas"". Not ""Dynasty"". For those who have seen it and don't like, just think of it as ""what would have happened if Bobby had died?"". Think of it as a fiction within the fiction. If you do so, honestly, don't yu think it's all great fun?",1251676800,,6282,4.605898123324397
3156990,5,B0016I0AGY,"I actually liked this season a little better than season 8. Once we get past the episodes about Bobby's passing and Sue Ellen's drinking it becomes fairly enjoyable.
The first few episodes have JR unfairly lashing out at Sue Ellen, Dusty and everyone else over Bobby's death. This seems a bit contrived or something to me. After all this is the ninth season that we have had to suffer through JR and Sue Ellen's most recent separation, divorce and custody battle and reconciliation. The episode that begins with Sue Ellen having a nightmare about being chased through the woods is bit much. Thankfully, they finally have Sue Ellen drying out and at least we have the impression that things can go forward in a different direction as this recurring conflict between JR and Sue Ellen had become dangerously close to self parody.

This season did seem to offer an attempt to go forward in a different direction. Bobby's death, Pam taking his place at Ewing Oil, Mark Graison's return, Sue Ellen drying out, etc. Only a few of the story lines seem kind of far fetched or just plain dumb.

The Emerald mine story seemed just plain dumb; as if Pam, after being sent on a wild goose chase last season to find Mark Graison who is presumed dead will suddenly venture to the jungles of South America for what ever reason she went there. Surprisingly, it seemed to make sense that upon her return she decides to sell JR her shares of Ewing Oil, thus giving JR what he's always wanted anyway, as well as Pam ridding herself of what she seemed to feel caused the all of the family's problems. JR has always been the only one who actually cared about the company anyway. This would also end the tiresome worn out, recycled story lines about who will control Ewing Oil this season and finally let JR have it.

The second weak story line is even dumber than the Emerald Mine story. The Angelica Nero story line - Angelica's husband Dmitri Marinos is either dying or already dead and has apparently written Angelica out of his will. Angelica finds that Jack Ewing is a dead ringer for the ailing Dmitri and plans to have Jack stand in for Dmitri at a masquerade ball on board a yacht in Greece. This will convince the public that Dmitri is still alive and well. Angelica will then forge Dmitri's signature on a new will naming her a sole heir of Dmitri Marinos Shipping. Jack Ewing standing in for Dmitri and cousin JR will be killed during an explosion on the yacht and Angelica will inherit Marinos shipping. However, something goes wrong with her plan. Jack and JR both look just plain ridiculous in the costumes at the ball. Angelica begins to suspect someone in her inner circle has betrayed her. Her assistant, Grace has actually fallen for Jack and warns him and JR that they are in great danger. At the ball when all Hell breaks loose Jack and JR head for hills or more accurately back to Dallas. Angelica gets caught in her own trap when she tries to kill JR. Since this is the dream season we never find out what became of that explosion at Ewing Oil or Jamie's car explosion which was meant for Jack. Strangely enough, of course, or maybe not so strangely the weakest storyline was the return of Bobby in the very last scene when we find out that it was all just a dream.
Another noticeable flaw is that we continue to see JR's schemes fail to accopmlish anything. Remember back in the classic Dallas era JR Ewing always covered his tracks and never left any stone unturned. This will eventually turn JR into a loser and more a black sheep, screw up rather than a villain.",1251158400,,3566,4.53416149068323

3156993,3,B0016I0AGY,"I only ever watched the season-ending cliffhangers of Dallas when it originally aired, not really being a fan of the programme; but I have been having an absolute ball going through each season of Dallas on DVD!!

Even so, season nine is definitely a lesser season: in acting, plotting, pacing, music cues. More on this later. But first, let me quickly add that this novel of seasons is a revisionist's dream. I was aware that this was the infamous dream season, so unlike the rest of the world who watched its original airing, I knew all of this was in Pam's head. And that is how I viewed the entire season, as if the producers had intentionally planned all along that everything we were going to see in season nine was just Pam's subconscious at work, the night after having sex with Bobby, her great love, who was engaged to Jenna. This was her dreamscape.

Pam simply dreaming - sometimes fitfully, obviously - is a great explanation for some of the character development and resurrections, dialogue, plot meandering, and other faults with this season. When she goes missing in Colombia, JR expresses two reasons to find her: 1 - he fears no one would believe he wasn't behind her death/disappearance if his plot with Cantrell ever came to light; 2 - he says he'd never be able to look himself in the mirror if anything ever happened to Pam. HA! The first is definitely JR to the core; the latter is Pam's subconscious' fantasy. The whole emerald mine is a woman's fantasy, so that fits in as a dream; as does the resurrection of a recent flame, her friend Sue Ellen falling once again to alcoholism and JR's arms, the new Ewing relations not being fully-fleshed out (or very interesting) characters, a meandering Ewing Oil plot for someone not completely involved in the oil business, and her brother reigning in his self-destructive tendencies to destroy JR. It all plays out like a dream. Perfect!

What's not perfect: Dack Rambo's acting, worse than Jenilee's and equal to Presley's. The man had the fakest laugh and smile. Too bad, because he was not bad to look at. Neither was Marc Singer, shirtless. But both were such posers! And while Nero's acting was mostly passable, her assistant's acting abilities appeared to zombify right before our very eyes as her time drew to a close. Yikes!

Ray and Donna often suffer as characters, their dialogue usually two-fingers deep, but the actors did a fine job for the most part, with a couple of deeply moving story-lines (and Tony was great! sorry to lose him to the alarm clock).

But the best episodes, meaning the best acted/scripted/paced/scored/etc. came at the last fifth of the season, the last 6 episodes. Interestingly, the entire season picked up at this point with a major push of 'happy' story-lines. In fact, I think episode 24 was almost nothing but good, warm feelings throughout. And then the cliffhangers were some of the best ever: killing Jamie? killing Sue Ellen? Bobby in the shower!

Awesome.

If I had been a fan of the programme during its original airing, this season may have put a cap on my viewing. As it stands now, it is worth it, even as a mere exercise in the study of dreams. And I gotta tell ya, I love the idea of wiping the slate clean and starting fresh with alternate story-lines. That's so cool!

But only in hindsight. And only once. One doesn't want to make a habit out of aborting an entire season.",1238630400,,3396,4.667224080267559

I've bought every season that has been released on DVD and have been very satisfied with seasons 8 & 9. I just ordered season 10. Season Nine is excellent. Although ""Bobby"" is absent from the dream, the storylines are fresh and exciting. The characters of Ray, Donna and Sue Ellen especially had an interesting year. It's a shame they couldn't pick up where they left off when season 10 begins. I highly recommend watching all of this season. I think the show did just fine without Bobby. After Bobby comes back I'm sure the show really went downhill, from reading some other reviews. Overall this is one of the best seasons of Dallas I've seen. It wasn't a nightmare to watch--I'm looking forward to season 10 just to see exactly lost I am in the characters that I grew to love in season 9.

Some of the newer characters were less than desirable,which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1232928000,,361,4.294117647058823
3156996,4,B0016I0AGY,"The title above pretty much sums up the so-called ""dream"" season.  In almost every episode the name of Bobby Ewing,"" formerly played by Patrick Duffy since the show's debut, is mentioned.  It seems that from the start, the producers did not want viewers to forget the character, hoping that the actor associated with the part would change his mind and return to the fold.

Even though the events of Season Nine - actually the EIGHTH full season -apparently didn't happen, it is still an entertaining one... well, at least the first half is.

It heralds the return of Barbara Bel Geddes as beloved ""Miss Ellie.""  It is obvious that the writers would ecstatic about the actress's return and they saddled her with some delicious dialogue and scenes that demonstrated the character, as well as the actress's, strength and compassion.  Her return is most welcome, bringing a bit of ""normalcy"" to a rather ""abnormal"" season.

The ""abnormal"" comes in the form of Barbara Carrera as the mysterious ""Angelica Nero.""  Obviously, trying to emulate ""Dynasty"" with its over-the-top ""Alexis Carrington"" (played with relish by Joan Collins), ""Dallas"" introduces Carrera, an international beauty and actress, as a woman with a plot of deception and murder that involves J.R. (Larry Hagman) and Jack Ewing (Dack Rambo).  During the run of the season, Carrera gets to wear some of the most outlandish - but stylish - clothes in the history of the medium which add to the character's personality.  It's like the writers are saying to the audience that this women deserves to be noticed 'cause - as the season develops - she's not one that needs to be ignored.

The season also sees the departure of Martha Scott's recurring role as Sue Ellen's (Linda Gray) mother, Patricia, along with the assumed ""riding-off-into-the-sunset"" departure of female viewer's favorite ""Dusty Farlow,"" played by Jared Martin.  Scott, an actress with a long career in film and television, gets to shine in the episodes ""Mothers"" and ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.""  Martin is there most to provide support for Gray's ""Sue Ellen"" as that character battles - and ultimately conquers - her alcohol demons.

Besides Carrera, the season also boasts some ""drop-bys"" by other notable actors.  Oscar winner George Chakiris (""West Side Story""), character actor Raymond St. Jacques, ""S.W.A.T's"" Steve Forrest, and Russell Johnson, forever engrained in TV audiences as ""The Professor"" on ""Gilligan's Island,"" make an appearance or two on the long-running drama.

Marc Singer joins the cast as ""Matt Cantrall,"" a friend of Bobby's that concocts a plan the leads Pam (Victoria Principal) to the jungles of South America to find emeralds.  Because Singer's height and build, along with 80's haircut, is similar to fellow castmate John Beck (""Mark Graison""), their scenes together seem almost mirrorlike, with the exception of Beck's trademark mustache.

As mentioned earlier, the first half of the season is the best.  The second suffers with the Angelica Nero storyline being dragged out too long and the ""How-crazy-is-she-going-to-get"" one dealing with Jenna Wade, played by Priscilla Presley.

But, even with those two elongated plots, the season still shows that there's still life left in the show, even with the ""death"" of Bobby one year earlier.  Even though it's a television drama, the writers manage to interject some responsible commentary on adoption, animal rights, alcohol abuse, and blood donation.

'Not bad for a show with ""oil"" in its veins.",1232755200,,3503,5.173758865248227
3156997,5,B0016I0AGY,"Season 9 of DALLAS is a must have - it is a true snapshot of the early to mid-80's.

The storyline is great, if a bit over the top.  The  writing was excellent,and seeing the episodes back to back you can appreciate that the writers were truly telling a long-term story.

(compare this to the endless Law and Order and CSI shows that we have now...)

DALLAS always had a big budget,and a huge cast- this was the centerpiece of the CBS schedule.  They were in a bit of a war with ABC's DYNASTY, and upped the glitz factor this season.

ABC had Nolan Miller, so LORIMAR hired (Bill) TRAVILLA to costume the cast. TRAVILLA had a spectacular career in film, dressing and creating classic looks for many stars.

TRAVILLA also was the designer for Knots Landing and Falcon Crest, but clearly saved the best for the DALLAS cast.

Some reviewers have been critical of the Marinos storyline, in particular the lovely Barbara Carrera as Angelica Nero.  She was cast as an ultra-vixen, and a seriously smart woman.  She was just as tough (if not more) than JR.

As the story goes on, Angelica becomes truly evil, is given a rest for a few episodes, and then comes back for the final few episodes to cause havoc (and eliminate a few guest stars) for the DALLAS cast.

This season is a keeper,and will be enjoyed by all-- particularly those who did not see it the 1st time around!

The first series - which I bought in Region 1 format - played on my multi-region player but since then DALLAS 9 and DYNASTY 2 and 3 (both Region 1 editions)will not.

A couple of nights ago the Home Theater Forum presented Warner Brothers Home Video (T.V. and Animation divisions only) for a chat. During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009. Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....

Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer. The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.

Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS. Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well. So FALCON CREST fans.....listen up....check out Knots Landing Season 1 (now) & Season 2 (in 2009)!!! Your show will be next up to bat if you do this.

I hope this helps the fans of both shows understand how important buying your favorite show the first week its release helps determine whether or not the studios will continue releasing a series (and other series). JUST A REMINDER: click on the Amazon's wish list reminder link to let you know when KNOTS LANDING SEASON 2 is released (it's definitely coming in 2009!!). Then when Warner makes the annoucement for the release, Amazon will let you know via email and then you can preorder your copy!! Thanks for reading!!!",1221609600,,2712,4.813304721030043

3157013,3,B0016I0AGY,"I am a huge 'Dallas' fan and yet I find myself on the fence about this Ninth Season. When stacked up against the previous seasons released, the ninth is just strange, oddly paced and not as exciting and thrilling as the previous ones. Is it good? Yes, of course, but it's just an average good, not the 'great' stamp you could put on the other seasons.

What you'll like about The Ninth Season is how we finally get a break from all the 'fight for Ewing Oil' saga. There is a plot element of this season that I won't spoil that has someone new moving into Bobby's now vacant office, but I never really perceived this as a fight for control as in the previous seasons. With Bobby out of the picture, the show seemed to shift the focus from the Ewing men to the Ewing women. Did it work? I thought so. Linda Gray's performance early on in this season is just beyond words. We get to see Sue Ellen's descent into pure drunkdom and how she falls to pieces as a result. I liked that Miss Ellie (played again by Barbara Bel Geddes) steps in this season and instead of always being whisked away by Clayton to some exotic vacation as in the previous seasons, Miss Ellie stays put at Southfork and realizes that she needs to keep everyone in line. We see a very strong, determined, motherly but wise Miss Ellie pretty much set everyone straight. The other women of the show including Donna, Pam and Jenna all have rather big plot arcs that dominate the season. The show even added a femme fatal character, Angelica Nero, to shake things up. I enjoyed the break from the usual oil and fight for the business plots and the focus being on the family and the characters as they cope with Bobby's lost and try to find new paths and directions in their lives.

What you won't like is the pacing. I found this season to be rather uneven, unfocused, always seeming to shift and switch to different  plots which left me as a viewer feeling jarred and confused. I still don't really understand the entire Angelica Nero plot; she seemed to be added in just to wear fancy clothes and threaten J.R. and Jack Ewing. Then we have Pam in the middle of the season going off to Colombia ... something else that left me wishing the focus of the show stayed on the city and happenings in and around Dallas, Texas. Sue Ellen's sobriety seemed to come too quickly from her departure from the sanatorium. There is also a point in the season where things that happened early on seem to be forgotten; Sue Ellen's re-adjusted quickly and not speaking of her early-season troubles, J.R. oddly goes from wanting to do away with Sue Ellen to being obsessed with re-capturing her heart, Jenna is over-the-top obsessed with Bobby until the final episodes of the season ... it was just confusing and a jumble of plots and odd behaviors and plots.

I won't touch the final episode of the season 'Blast from the Past' though many have already spoiled it. I think it's that episode that really leaves me on the fence about this season. The show appeared to have taken a big chance with many characters and even some plots such as Donna and Ray's pregnancy/child situation, but one episode pretty much undoes it all. An entire season of development, of confrontations such as one between Pam and Jenna that was a major twist, or Cliff finally coming to respect Jamie, undone to be re-written for the next season. Depending on your take of the season, it may have been a good or bad thing.

In all, this season was just okay for me. It is fun to watch knowing that it's a dream because there are sudden hints and allusions dropped throughout the season that hint that most of this is just a dream. There was a grittier feel to at least half the season - the second half felt more soap opera, over-the-top like similar to 'Dynasty' rather than having the drama edge of the past seasons. I also felt the quality of the DVD transfer could have been a bit better. In all, good, but not a great season. Check it out.",1217808000,,3964,4.43956043956044

Meanwhile, we get the late Dack Rambo filling in a bit for Duffy as the macho good guy Jack Ewing; Barbara Bel Geddes returning as Miss Ellie (after a season's absence, during which the role was played by Donna Reed); and guest star Barbara Carerra, exotic, mysterious, and flamboyantly dressed as Angelica Nero. The absence of good guy Bobby as a foil caused nasty J.R. to actually find himself on the side of the angels at times.

In order to do that, you would have to compress the episodes even more resulting in poorer picture quality. And that, Warner Bros., SUCKS!

The one thing that set Dallas and Dynasty apart was that Dynasty, though very entertaining was over the top glamorous and thus somewhat silly, Dallas was down to earth with real characters, and season 9's attempt at emulating Dynasty was it's downfall, not Pam's dream.

3157024,3,B0016I0AGY,"Fortunately, the real Miss Ellie is back (in the form of Barbara Bel Geddes) but this is an otherwise strange year.

With Bobby ostensibly dead, new writer/producers took over the show and attempt to make it both more introspective (like spin-off KNOTS LANDING) but also more glamorous (like rival DYNASTY).

The first half of the season almost works--- it's edgier and experimental. But mid-way thru, the plotting just becomes muddled without any direction, and you have characters making nice-nice who never ordinarily would. The scenes become increasingly maudlin, taking on a frankly prissy ""Little-Woman-Fixes-All"" perspective which is riminiscent of the old daytime soaps from prior decades, and it's not an improvement.

By year's end (SPOILER ALERT!!) Bobby re-appears in Pam's shower... Back in 1986, this became DALLAS' biggest cliffhanger since J.R. was shot: how is Bobby alive??

But it was the answer which became THE biggest ""Jump the Shark"" moment in TV history: Bobby's death and the entire subsequent year was all one long dream on the part of Bobby's ex-wife, Pam.

Many long-term viewers tuned-out never came back. The dream scenario became a sitcom punchline for years.

Sure, DALLAS was a ""soap"", but also one of the most influential shows in TV history, and fans were appalled by the use of the dream because it wasn't the kind of device the series was accustomed to previously throwing at their audience.

Suffice it to say, DALLAS never recovered either its audience or the hard-won respect it had earned up until that time. DALLAS had quite literally become a legend in its own time, and critics had eventually been won over by the show, acknowledging it to be a legitimate drama--- until this, an insulting plot contrivance which wound up validating all the ""it's just a soap"" cliches the series had worked so fervently to overcome prior to that.

The use of the dream was the result of petty squabbles between producers, with the fans ultimately left out in the cold. And even to this day, some people close to the show claim that the dream was ""the only way to bring Bobby back"" and that ""the ratings surged up again after the dream scenario was used""....

3157027,5,B0016I0AGY,"""Dallas"" Season 9 (1985-86)  begins with final goodbyes to Bobby as the Ewing clan come together to pay their respects.  This season sees the departure of Patrick Duffy, as Bobby, and the  return of the much beloved Barbara Belle Geddes, as she reprises her role as Miss Ellie. Donna Reed, of course, exits the show,  and new faces abound as Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company) as Jamie Ewing Barnes, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, Marc Singer as Matt Cantrell, and John Beck returns as Mark Graison.  As mentioned in the previous reviews, ""Season 9"" is Pam Ewing's ""dream season,"" and is quiet enjoyable in it's storyline and characters.  The return of Patrick Duffy as Bobby Ewing in the following season, was no doubt an attempt to boost the shows TV ratings and put it back in the top spot.  ""Dallas"" fans have seen ""the best"" of the series with these 9 season sets, with the shows producers and directors loosing the show's identity with far-fetched shcemes and over-the-top glamour that strays way too far from the original formula that made ""Dallas"" the traditional TV drama that viewers loved to endulge themselves in.  The original formula of TV's ""Dallas"" guaranteed the viewer a season filled with fun and creative storylines which remained in a believable setting that the viewer had not only become familiar with, but enjoyed looking forward to the suspense and drama that came with each episodes deals, plots, and schemes! And as the season came to it's close it always gleefully culminated into a ""season finale cliffhanger"" that left you begging for more!

""Dallas - The Complete Tenth Season"" is probably scheduled for a late Autumn release this year, and will continue where Season 8 left off, which makes this ""Season 9"" sadly ""obsolete.""  I just don't understand how the show's writers could simply toss out Season 9's storylines and happenings and think that the show wouldn't be damaged in some way by it?  Bobby Ewing was a great part of the ""Dallas"" cast, however, his resurrection became the death of it.",1207612800,,8794,4.85809906291834
3157028,5,B0016I0AGY,"As it was expected the 9nth season of dallas will be released this coming summer. A turning point in the dallas saga as this season was the first to drop out of nielsen's top 5 since the ""who shot j.r"" season 6 years ago. Dallas was the NO 1 or NO 2 show for 5 years from 81 to 85 but beginning with the ""dream season"" ratings droped due to bobby's departured and to capice's involvement who wanted WRONGLY to make dallas more like a ""dynasty"" series.
 Next season was the last to include all of the original cast as bell geddes was back from this season and bobby returned in the 1986-1987 season so except for lucy all others were present in dalla's 10nth season but it was already too late because the soap-crazed era was at an end. Dynasty finished the 86-87 season at #24 as all other soaps like falcon crest and knots landind finished in low positions and only dallas managed to finish at #11 which was a triumph for a series 10 years old BUT as i said the damage was already done and at the end of the season victoria principal announced she was leaving due to personal reasons and this was the beginning of the end. Susan howard also left and in the next 11nth season it was the turn of steve kanaly and priscilla presley. In the 12th season linda gray left and when the show reached it's final 14nth season two years later ONLY 3 of the original cast members were still present. patrick duffy, larry hagman and ken kercheval. As i said dallas finished at #11 in it's tenth season, at #22 in it's 11nth season, at #30 in it's 12th season and it's last two seasons were out of the top 40 so it was canselled in 1991.
 Enjoy this season which was to become a dream and wait for the next season which was the last season of dallas that all original cast were present in the post jim davis era except only for tilton who was to come back in 1988.
 In my opinion dalla's final demise started after victoria left the show and other cast members followed her as ratings were droping fast because it was the end of the soap-crazed era and because mr. Capice tried to change dallas into something it wasn't but that's another matter.
 In this season everybody mourns bobby, mark graison is back from the ""dead"" but don't forget that all is pam's dream so we wait the next season to see what really happened after the ""supposed"" bobby's death.
 Until then enjoy another great DREAM SEASON OF DALLAS.",1207353600,,2397,4.341517857142857
3157029,5,B0016I0AGY,"Ah the controversial dream season arrives! I guess we're not in Dallas anymore Toto. For that alone this deserves a five-star rating. Admittedly, many (if not all) Dallas fans were deeply conflicted about the show's attempt at adding a bit of gloss to the sudsy goings-on at Southfork. The void left in the wake of Patrick Duffy's departure would be felt throughout the season despite the extra testosterone supplied by Dack Rambo, Marc Singer and the return of John Beck. Interestingly enough, the show's original premise was to have Bobby die following his wedding to Pam, leaving the grieving widow to deal with the Ewings. And while the powers-that-be kept flirting with the idea (Mr. Hagman certainly played it this way for most of the show's run), even going so far this season as to set the perfect stage - the battle between Pam and JR never quite materializes - ill-veiled threats from both sides notwithstanding. While most of the new ideas meant to revitalize the show ultimately caused a kind of dissonance to its brand, they, at the least, made this particular season stand out. Frankly, had I been faced with trying to create excitement for the show at this point, why bother with Angelica Nero? I'd have negotiated a cross-over storyline with Dynasty. Imagine JR and Alexis playing a corporate ""Strangers on a Train"" deal of you destroy my enemy and I'll destroy yours. Nielsen would've blown a fuse! But I digress. This season is well worth Pam's extended REM cycle with enough intrigue and melodrama to keep everyone on tenterhooks until she flings open that shower door and finds there's no place like home.",1206748800,,1625,4.870036101083032
3157030,5,B0016I0AGY,"Well, here we are finally, at the release of the famous dream season.  Now, after my last review where I got down on the last season, I found upon re-watching it that it was really quite good-I think all of Dallas is brilliant in it's way really.  So, this season is different to be sure-Leonard Katzman was gone and the style of the show went very glamorous, very Dynasty-esque, and it is not at all like Dallas of before or after in many ways.  Lucy is gone and that doesn't matter of course, but Bobby is also gone and that does indeed make a difference.  The season itself has of course been hampered in retrospect by the fact that we now know none of it really happens.  Nevertheless, there are still plenty of interesting twists and turns that keep the season good dramatically.  The only question is how you will react to the different ways that the characters speak and act, and that I've found is more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  I am not going to lie that this is probably my least favorite season of the show for these reasons I've listed above-but it still beats almost anything else from other shows, and it's still Dallas so it gets 5 stars, especially after I was pleasantly surprised by my re-viewing of the last season on DVD.  With Barabara Bel Geddes back as Miss Ellie, and also starring Jared Martin as Dusty Farlow, Steve Forrest as Ben Stivers, Deborah Shelton as Mandy Winger, Jenilee Harrison as Jamie Ewing Barnes, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, Marc Singer as Matt Cantrell, and John Beck as Mark Graison.",1206576000,,1547,4.519713261648746

As to the story, it was mostly decent, but had a few fails. Jamie is injured and needs a blood transfusion, but only Jack has the right blood. She's AB-, which, according to my college bio teacher, means she can accept blood from everybody except those with the Rh factor (+). Getting Rh+ blood would be bad for her, but not getting blood with A and B antigens should have no effect on her.",1451779200,,596,4.418181818181818

3391428,5,B0016I0AGY,"This is the best season in years of the show, have to keep remembering its all a dream. My somewhat unpopular opinion (from what I've seen) is that the first Four seasons of the series were the best ever. The unpopular part, is that seasons Five, Six and Seven were pretty boring. Season 7 got exciting the last 6 episodes (When Clayton's sister Jessica, Played by Alexis Smith comes) and then season Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven and Twelve were all pretty good. I have seen some say that season 9 -12 are unwatchable, i disagree, i haven't finished season 9 yet, however I'm 12 episodes in and its more interesting than past seasons. I think i like some of the later years of the show better than the middle years is because of the different storylines, a little more melodrama, which some people think is cheesy, sometimes it is, but nonetheless its entertaining. Season 9, Pam finally has an attractive hairstyle for the first time since season 4, Sue Ellen is finally getting over her alcoholism and J.R is finally facing some adversities. Seasons 8 -12 had more going on besides back and forth crooked oil deals and Sue Ellen getting drunk. Though new characters came in and left, and original characters left. with flaws, i think season 8 -12 still had some really interesting moments, that 5, 6 and 7 really lacked. I think Jamie should have stayed on the rest of the show as Cliff's wife. I liked Afton, but Jaimie had more personality. I don't get why the writers had to get everyone together and break everyone up after a season or two. Jack Ewing was somewhat useless, besides season 9's Angelica Nero plot line. And even though he was an original, I don't think the show needed Bobby. Sometimes he bugged me with his occasional holier than thou attitude. And i think Pam was much better with Mark Graison, whom she marries in this dream season, but afterward its all erased, so he really was dead all along and she is still going to remarry Bobby in season 10. It can all be a bit confusing. I always liked Lucy, however the writers never came up with anything more for her, besides liking a guy, Which got really lame. If only she could have stayed all the way through with interesting stuff to do. They bring her back at the end of season 11 throughout 12 and 13 for more sitting around. until she finally leaves near the end of the 13th season. For anyone who is interested in this series, my obvious advice would to start from the very beginning, the 1978 episodes, some complete seasons aren't THAT vital like season 5 or 6. but still important to watch in order. So you won't be confused because each season is different.",1419811200,,2635,4.53781512605042

3391436,5,B0016I0AGY,"Despite this entire season being a figment of Pam's imagination, I found it very enjoyable. Certainly more watchable than Dallas' last 2 seasons. Whether it was Bobby's absence or competition from Miami Vice, this season slipped from #2-#6 in the ratings. Most would agree that this season of Dallas was trying to follow in Dynasty's footsteps. You can thank executive producer Philip Capice for that. This was the first time Capice got involved with the writing of Dallas, where as Lenny Katzman had been involved in the previous 8 seasons. Katzman left at the end of season 8 to direct a new show on the east coast. It lasted only one season, & thanks to Larry Hagman Katzman returned and became executive producer in season 10. Rumor has it Capice was offered a million dollars to leave Dallas. One way or the other Philip Capice was gone for good.
  As far as story lines are concerned, I really enjoyed the Anjelica Nero plot. She always had something up her sleeve, and JR could never figure out what it was. I really enjoyed Ray & Donna's ordeal they went through with having to cope with a mentally challenged baby, then the miscarriage, then deciding to adopt a deaf boy who crawled into their hearts. Donna was a favorite character of mine, and I hated to see her gone the following season. Jenna's pretty much a basket case this entire season. At first she managed to cope with Bobby's death but eventually started blaming herself for all the circumstances involving his death. Sue Ellen's drunken, desperate housewife act was starting to wear thin from previous seasons. It was a nice change to see her pick herself up, remain sober, & become a part of the working class. I guess Pam's wild goose chase in season 8 wasn't a total waste. Mark Graison was alive and returned as Pam's fianc. Mark explains his cancer was in remission, and Pam decides she doesnt want Mark to spend the rest of his life alone, so she accepts his proposal. They finally tied the knot in the season finale. Speaking of Pam and Mark, perhaps the least -liked story line was the emerald mine in Colombia. Even Victoria herself said it was her least favorite of all Dallas' story lines involving Pam. The last few episodes of season 9 seemed to be surreal. Everybody seemed to get along so well. Ray & Donna reconciled and adopted a son. Sue Ellen & JR were happier than ever. Cliff, who had married Jamie for business reasons in season 8, was very much in love with her this season. It all seemed like a dream that all these characters who were at odds with each other at the end of season 8 were living happily ever after. Perhaps that's because it was a dream. Season 10 picked up where season 8 left off. Mark Graison is never mentioned again, so we are to assume either he died in that plane crash, or he was in one of those clinics and succumbed to his illness. Ray and Donna remained separated, & of course Sue Ellen and JR were living separate lives. Most Dallas fans would agree this is when the show 'jumped the shark.' Perhaps they're right because the ratings never recovered. Season 9 fell to #6 and season 10 fell to #11. Despite the controversy, this season is still very watchable unlike the last 3.

3391443,3,B0016I0AGY,"After the heart-wrenching final minutes of Season 8, the storm settles into a gentle rain. But, of course, this is DALLAS, and any quietness that occurs is merely an illusion, and it's doubly true in this case. There is one storyline in particular that I liked from this season: Donna with the special needs children. Mark's return, however, I did NOT like. That is one reason I'm glad this season and the final 15 minutes of Season 8 are (somewhat awkwardly) explained away as a dream.

The second reason: Even though I received this season in the condition Used-Very Good, the episodes J.R. Rising, and Blast From The Past would not play, and only the last 10-15 minutes of Serendipity would play. I find that really odd, as there was no indication that there were scratches on the discs.

For the reasons enumerated above, I give this season of DALLAS III stars.

3391448,2,B0016I0AGY,"This season has been confusing on so many levels.  Hair colors and styles would change from episode to episode.  SueEllen started out a reddish brown and now she is gray or blonde.  JR would flunctuate between gray and black.  The haircuts would change from scene to scene.  Everybody is now extremely wealthy; there are literally no working class people on the show anymore.

One odd thing was the tightness of Dack Rambo's pants.  I even looked him up because his pants were so tight and found out he was gay.  It really is obvious on the show because the writers wouldn't even let him kiss or make out with any woman on the show, even though he is the hottest guy on the show.

Angelica stands out like a sore thumb; she is some sort of European trying to do business with Ewing oil; she seems like a caricature of a villian or something; like somebody you would see on SCOOBY DOO.

Jenna is losing her mind.  Ray and Donna are volunteering with special needs children.  Ms. Ellie is back (THANK GOODNESS) and Sue Ellen is working (THANK GOODNESS).  SueEllen and JR are fighting or reconciling or whatever.  Pam has been kidnapped and returns unaffected.

The whole season has been like a puzzle; you basically had to try to put together the storylines yourself.

Pros and Cons of this season:

PROS:
1. SueEllen has a job and has a life outside of JR and Southfork and, as a result, JR has developed a level of respect towards her that wasn't evident in past seasons.

2. Donna and Rae are finally building a house that a wealthy couple would live in.  The Donna actress even commented to producers that it made no sense for the KREBBS to be hanging clothes on the line when they are millionaires

3. Ellie is back and her grandmother demeanor and clothes is a pleasant contrast to all the glamour and over dressing that takes place on the show

4. Cliff actually has a wife with a brain, Jamie.

5. JR actually seems to be showing love towards SueEllen

CONS:
1. Jack- Dack Rambo is hot, but it is clear that he is uncomfortable with the women on the show and uncomfortable with his storyline or lack thereof

2. JR became a wuss this season.  Many betrayed him and he did nothing.  SueEllen ends up on skid row and afterwards he decides he can't live without her and leaves his girlfriend for her.  The old JR would have left Mandy, got a new girlfriend, and then pretended to be with SueEllen

3. Mark Grayson, Matt, and Pam - I just don't see the point of them being on the show

4. Jenna and Charlie - I just didn't see the point of them being on the show

5. Ben - this guy doesn't even try to pretend he is not creepy; he is outwardly creepy

The worst part of the show, however, is

#6. Angelica and Grace - they were pretentious Europeans who didn't even fit in with the show at all.",1394755200,,2796,4.358527131782946

JR giving up Mandy waiting for Sue Ellen to come back to him; that would never happen. Cliff and Jamie's relationship please!
Should be seen to see how a bad producer (Phil Caprice) can truly ruin a great hit show. And how Leonard Katzman fixed everything and brought the true Dallas back in Season 10.

I can say now that I have seen every single episode of both shows and both shows are just fantastic and very powerful, even to this day. It just seems so ODD not having to WAIT. Watching over a decade's worth of shows in a year was just kind of ODD, but a BLAST not having to wait.

Last season with Donna Reed was, to me and others I know, what the real Miss Ellie should be.  She was an attractive older woman who can act, dressed attractively but appropriately, and was just so real.  Barbara Bel Geddes has spent all these prior seasons lumbering about in ugly, colorless sack dresses not worthy of Jock Ewing's wife, staring off into space and seldom looking anyone in the eye as she drones her lines, and every once in a while she drawls ""Jayyyyy  Ahhhhhh,"" to J.R. or referring to him. To see her return in this season nine was the biggest let down for me.  Of course I knew she would be back, I'm old enough to remember watching the entire series on television. But the let down was no less because of that. I recommend buying this season for any true Dallas fans who want to own the whole series and make it complete, but to sit and watch it all as a dream -- I didn't do it.

It was especially sad to see that the whole storyline with Ray and Donna losing their Downs Syndrome baby and then adopting Tony, never happened.  ALL the characters had come so far in this season, that it didn't even seem worth it just to have Bobby back.  Of course, we all know how famous this ""dream season"" is in the history of television, but looking back, it really is a shame that some of the stories and arcs couldn't have been continued in the coming seasons.  Even though it brought Patrick Duffy back, it seemed to create the end for so many of the other characters (Pam, Donna, Ray, Jenna, Jaime, etc).

3391478,3,B0016I0AGY,"**NOTE - This review contains Spoilers**

Season 9 of ""Dallas"" ran on CBS during the 1985-86 TV season and has becomes infamous as the ""dream season"" in which Bobby turns up in the shower in the finale negating everything that has transpired in the past 31 episodes.

Patrick Duffy's departure becomes the death knell for the series as it never fully recovers. Even the return of Barbara Bel Geddes can't reverse the trend.

""Special Guest Star"" Barbara Carrera is a colossal bore as the exotic Angelica Nero, who works for a Greek shipping magnate and has a special interest in cousin Jack (Dack Rambo) who bears a strong resemblance to the ailing tycoon of Marinos Shipping. This is one of the most boring plots ever on ""Dallas"" and Carrera seems better suited to ""Dynasty"" with her gold lame gowns, capes and turbans overpowering every scene she's in.

J.R. is less sadistic this season and seems to be softening a bit. When he learns of Mandy's betrayal, how does he punish her? By personally handing her the title to the deluxe condo, that's how! If Afton had done the same thing a few seasons back, he would have kicked her to the curb faster than you can say ""offshore drilling"". J.R. does put the screws to the cartel once again, and he and Sue Ellen start another custody battle for John Ross but it's all a big case of ""been-there-done-that"".

Pam discovers Mark Graison (John Beck) still alive, having staged his death earlier, and the two decide to marry. Pam also jumps ship from Barnes-Wentworth for Ewing Oil when she inherits Bobby's shares. The reading of the will is one of the season's best scenes.

Dack Rambo assumes the ""good-guy"" role vacated by Duffy but is a poor substitute, and teaming him with Priscilla Presley, easily the worst actress on the show, does him no favours. The writers even unsuccessfully try and play him up to the audience, with dialogue like ""women just flock to him"".

Deborah Shelton is still on board as J.R.'s mistress Mandy Winger and continues to underwhelm, though she's not as annoying as Jenna and daughter Charlie (they aren't even related by marriage, so why are they living at Southfork?).

Even Jamie (Jenilee Harrison) has become dull this season, spending a good portion of it in a sick-bed after marrying Cliff and suffering a workplace accident. Her survival depends on locating a rare blood type, but will a donor be found in time?

Marc Singer appears as Bobby's old pal Matt Cantrell who needs Pam to help finance his emerald-mining operation in Columbia. Pam accompanies him there and ends up being kidnapped in the jungle. Singer's Beastmaster body and 9th-grade-nerd voice make for an odd combination and the only really interesting thing about this plotline is it also features Alejandro Rey (""The Flying Nun"") as a corrupt Columbian police chief.

Steve Forrest appears as new mature ranch hand Ben Stivers, who seems to have a keen interest in Miss Ellie for some reason. This storyline doesn't really blossom until next season.

Clayton tries to keep his financial problems from Miss Ellie, but she finds out and secretly starts buying up the companies he's trying to unload.

There are only two storylines that make this season worthwhile. Donna learns she's pregnant, but that the child has Down's syndrome (her reaction scene is perhaps Susan Howard's best work on the series), and she and Ray agonize over making the right decision. Sue Ellen hits rock bottom and ends up swilling cheap wine on skid row with derelicts in her designer duds before she's committed once again to a sanitarium. Linda Gray gives a no-holds barred performance during her freak-out scenes in the drunk tank and hospital. They're definitely the highlight of the season. (One of the hookers asks her mockingly ""What'ya starin' at honey? My slip showin'?""). Another hilarious moment occurs when Sue Ellen wakes up in a sleazy, roach-trap of a motel room and tells the cleaning lady, straight-faced ""I'd like to have a Bloody Mary sent up""). With some help from the returning Dusty (Jared Martin), Sue Ellen turns her life around and gets a job as fundraiser for Mark Graison's medical research center, becoming involved with her boss, Dr. Kenderson.

Once again, we get dual-sided discs. The picture quality is very good and the episodes all contain the original 80s Lorimar closing logo. *Trivia Note* Episode #23 ""Sitting Ducks"" was directed by Susan Howard (Donna Krebbs).

While many fans made a big stink about Donna Reed in Season 8, THIS is the first season of ""Dallas"" that made me hold my nose. Completists and fans of Donna Krebbs and Sue Ellen will want to see this for some of their best moments, others should just be like Pam and pretend it was all a lousy bad dream and skip this one.",1325116800,,4750,4.8122699386503065

***** SPOILERS****

THE PROS

1) For the first time in the entire series, every character has an interesting storyline to deal with. In previous seasons, at least one, sometimes two, major character(s) was (were) a bit left aside, only supporting the others. It was often the case with Sue Ellen at the beginning, then alternatively Miss Ellie, Ray or Pam, then Bobby after the end of the fight for Ewing Oil (which caused P. Duffy's, who got bored by the role, temporary departure).
This time, EVERYONE (with the possible exception of Jenna Wade) have strong issues to deal with and have to stretch their personality out of their usual limits. Special mention to Linda Gray/Sue Ellen whose part is truly memorable and acting job amazing. The storyline of Ray and Donna is extremely intense too, which was rarely the case in previous seasons.
Anoter good point: second-hand characters this time have real weight. Subplots are all here for a reason, they are well entangled with the main action. Special mention for the love affair between Jack and Grace. Grace's character, the hot and the cold (the cold THEN the hot) was a treat. And very well played, by an actress who didn't just rely on her beauty.

2) For the first time ever too, there's no release of the dramatic intensity throughout the season. During previous seasons, numerous episodes were mere transition episodes. Sometimes there were 8 or 10 filler-ups in a rank, which could cause a certain humdrum and loss of the viewer's interest. Seasons 7 and 8 were very disappointing in this regard. No such thing here. Only 2 or 3 episodes may be considered as pure transition episodes. They were necessary to release the pressure caused by the main plots (Mark's resurrection, the Marinos scam, Pam's kidnapping in Columbia, Sue Ellen's descent to hell, Donna's accident, etc.). During season 9, the necessary transition phases are craftfully melted with the intense phases. Some characters re-catch their breath while others are in the eye of the storm, alternatively. Hence the action never bogs down, but no episode leaves a feeling of ""Hey, that's too much now!"". ""Dallas"" was, and always remained, a family entertainment.

3) For the first time ever, JR faces a first-hand villain, smart and dangerous like him, probably even more. This had only be the case, with a much lesser extent, with the character of Jeremy Wendell before (it will be FULLY the case with Wendell later). Angelica Nero was a great incarnation of evil. For the first time, JR does not lead the game, he has to think fast and anticipate on the blows. For sure he has to play defense for most of the season (which is why most of Dallas' fans and apparently Larry Hagman himself didn't like the season), but he does it well, he's as smart and tough as always, and, in the end, he strikes back - and brilliantly. I don't think Mr Hagman should despise his part in this season, he's flamboyant throughout all his relationship with angelica Nero, and very touching with his son or Sue Ellen. No shame to have about all that's been done. The character didn't become the good guy of the series (thank Lord!), here he's a shark facing a different kind of shark, maybe a little more human than usual on the surface (with Sue Ellen, Pam and Jack), but only on the surface.

4) The writers and producers tried an audacious change of scope with this season, taking out ""Dallas"" out of the city limits, which is considered as another bad point by most fans because it seemed to be a way of surfing on the ""Dynasty"" trend. Well - let's think of it! After 8 years of action taking place in the same geographical area, do you think a single city and a single state (even Texas) can provide enough material for a soap opera like this one? ""Dallas"" had started to repeat itself during season 8: legal affairs, broken marriages, long-time rivalities between families and between men... ""Dallas"" had to make a step into the unknown, which it did. I agree it couldn't reproduce over-the-top plots like the Marinos affair of the Columbia mines every year (although the B.D. Calhoun's during season 10 is something too), but what was done had to be done, and it was well done.

THE CONS

Of course, the flaws of season 9 are numerous. They are well known, just report to the other reviews. The main one, in my opinion, is the recurring lacks of coherence. What makes Angelica Nero think that her scam will succeed and that nobody who knew Jack Ewing will claim it's him who died in Martinique and not Dimitri Marinos? Why does JR hires a private eye to get some info on Marinos, and later doesn't care what he has become and why his report hasn't arrived? Why does Pam accept to step into Bobby's steps at Ewing Oil and spend half his day working with a man she despises? Why does Sue Ellen, in the end of the season, falls in love like a teenager for a man who brought her near self-destruction at the beginning? Why does Pam dream of a man (Ben Stivers) she has never met before and who will appear (as Wes Parmalee) during season 10? She's never been very witty before, so it's hard to imagine she has some sort of psychic abilites...

Another bad point in my opinion is the sad destiny of Jack Ewing / Dack Rambo. Rambo did some very good job replacing Bobby as the good guy. Too bad the producers decided to write him off the story during season 10 because of Patrick Duffy's return. Althoug I have no problem with P. Duffy returning, nor with the fact that this entire season had all been a dream, I do have some with the fact that all storylines developped during season 9 had to be reconsidered and reorientated brutally at the beginning of season 10. It was sometimes sad for the characters (especially Ray and Donna, who were close to have found happiness), and, in the case of Dack Rambo and John Beck, for the actors themselves.

Anyway, to me this season was a masterpiece of invention and energy. For those who haven't seen it, don't panic: it IS ""Dallas"". Not ""Dynasty"". For those who have seen it and don't like, just think of it as ""what would have happened if Bobby had died?"". Think of it as a fiction within the fiction. If you do so, honestly, don't yu think it's all great fun?",1251676800,,6282,4.605898123324397
3391487,5,B0016I0AGY,"I actually liked this season a little better than season 8. Once we get past the episodes about Bobby's passing and Sue Ellen's drinking it becomes fairly enjoyable.
The first few episodes have JR unfairly lashing out at Sue Ellen, Dusty and everyone else over Bobby's death. This seems a bit contrived or something to me. After all this is the ninth season that we have had to suffer through JR and Sue Ellen's most recent separation, divorce and custody battle and reconciliation. The episode that begins with Sue Ellen having a nightmare about being chased through the woods is bit much. Thankfully, they finally have Sue Ellen drying out and at least we have the impression that things can go forward in a different direction as this recurring conflict between JR and Sue Ellen had become dangerously close to self parody.

This season did seem to offer an attempt to go forward in a different direction. Bobby's death, Pam taking his place at Ewing Oil, Mark Graison's return, Sue Ellen drying out, etc. Only a few of the story lines seem kind of far fetched or just plain dumb.

The Emerald mine story seemed just plain dumb; as if Pam, after being sent on a wild goose chase last season to find Mark Graison who is presumed dead will suddenly venture to the jungles of South America for what ever reason she went there. Surprisingly, it seemed to make sense that upon her return she decides to sell JR her shares of Ewing Oil, thus giving JR what he's always wanted anyway, as well as Pam ridding herself of what she seemed to feel caused the all of the family's problems. JR has always been the only one who actually cared about the company anyway. This would also end the tiresome worn out, recycled story lines about who will control Ewing Oil this season and finally let JR have it.

The second weak story line is even dumber than the Emerald Mine story. The Angelica Nero story line - Angelica's husband Dmitri Marinos is either dying or already dead and has apparently written Angelica out of his will. Angelica finds that Jack Ewing is a dead ringer for the ailing Dmitri and plans to have Jack stand in for Dmitri at a masquerade ball on board a yacht in Greece. This will convince the public that Dmitri is still alive and well. Angelica will then forge Dmitri's signature on a new will naming her a sole heir of Dmitri Marinos Shipping. Jack Ewing standing in for Dmitri and cousin JR will be killed during an explosion on the yacht and Angelica will inherit Marinos shipping. However, something goes wrong with her plan. Jack and JR both look just plain ridiculous in the costumes at the ball. Angelica begins to suspect someone in her inner circle has betrayed her. Her assistant, Grace has actually fallen for Jack and warns him and JR that they are in great danger. At the ball when all Hell breaks loose Jack and JR head for hills or more accurately back to Dallas. Angelica gets caught in her own trap when she tries to kill JR. Since this is the dream season we never find out what became of that explosion at Ewing Oil or Jamie's car explosion which was meant for Jack. Strangely enough, of course, or maybe not so strangely the weakest storyline was the return of Bobby in the very last scene when we find out that it was all just a dream.
Another noticeable flaw is that we continue to see JR's schemes fail to accopmlish anything. Remember back in the classic Dallas era JR Ewing always covered his tracks and never left any stone unturned. This will eventually turn JR into a loser and more a black sheep, screw up rather than a villain.",1251158400,,3566,4.53416149068323

3391489,5,B0016I0AGY,"This is my husband favorite show of all time. It is his mission to collect the whole series, love it.",1241049600,,101,4.1
3391490,3,B0016I0AGY,"I only ever watched the season-ending cliffhangers of Dallas when it originally aired, not really being a fan of the programme; but I have been having an absolute ball going through each season of Dallas on DVD!!

Even so, season nine is definitely a lesser season: in acting, plotting, pacing, music cues. More on this later. But first, let me quickly add that this novel of seasons is a revisionist's dream. I was aware that this was the infamous dream season, so unlike the rest of the world who watched its original airing, I knew all of this was in Pam's head. And that is how I viewed the entire season, as if the producers had intentionally planned all along that everything we were going to see in season nine was just Pam's subconscious at work, the night after having sex with Bobby, her great love, who was engaged to Jenna. This was her dreamscape.

Pam simply dreaming - sometimes fitfully, obviously - is a great explanation for some of the character development and resurrections, dialogue, plot meandering, and other faults with this season. When she goes missing in Colombia, JR expresses two reasons to find her: 1 - he fears no one would believe he wasn't behind her death/disappearance if his plot with Cantrell ever came to light; 2 - he says he'd never be able to look himself in the mirror if anything ever happened to Pam. HA! The first is definitely JR to the core; the latter is Pam's subconscious' fantasy. The whole emerald mine is a woman's fantasy, so that fits in as a dream; as does the resurrection of a recent flame, her friend Sue Ellen falling once again to alcoholism and JR's arms, the new Ewing relations not being fully-fleshed out (or very interesting) characters, a meandering Ewing Oil plot for someone not completely involved in the oil business, and her brother reigning in his self-destructive tendencies to destroy JR. It all plays out like a dream. Perfect!

What's not perfect: Dack Rambo's acting, worse than Jenilee's and equal to Presley's. The man had the fakest laugh and smile. Too bad, because he was not bad to look at. Neither was Marc Singer, shirtless. But both were such posers! And while Nero's acting was mostly passable, her assistant's acting abilities appeared to zombify right before our very eyes as her time drew to a close. Yikes!

Ray and Donna often suffer as characters, their dialogue usually two-fingers deep, but the actors did a fine job for the most part, with a couple of deeply moving story-lines (and Tony was great! sorry to lose him to the alarm clock).

But the best episodes, meaning the best acted/scripted/paced/scored/etc. came at the last fifth of the season, the last 6 episodes. Interestingly, the entire season picked up at this point with a major push of 'happy' story-lines. In fact, I think episode 24 was almost nothing but good, warm feelings throughout. And then the cliffhangers were some of the best ever: killing Jamie? killing Sue Ellen? Bobby in the shower!

Awesome.

If I had been a fan of the programme during its original airing, this season may have put a cap on my viewing. As it stands now, it is worth it, even as a mere exercise in the study of dreams. And I gotta tell ya, I love the idea of wiping the slate clean and starting fresh with alternate story-lines. That's so cool!

But only in hindsight. And only once. One doesn't want to make a habit out of aborting an entire season.",1238630400,,3396,4.667224080267559
3391491,5,B0016I0AGY,"I just finished watching this entire season tonight. The first time I've seen it, I lost interest in DALLAS after the 7th season when it originally aired in the 80s. I've bought every season that has been released on DVD and have been very satisfied with seasons 8 & 9. I just ordered season 10. Season Nine is excellent. Although ""Bobby"" is absent from the dream, the storylines are fresh and exciting. The characters of Ray, Donna and Sue Ellen especially had an interesting year. It's a shame they couldn't pick up where they left off when season 10 begins. I highly recommend watching all of this season. I think the show did just fine without Bobby. After Bobby comes back I'm sure the show really went downhill, from reading some other reviews. Overall this is one of the best seasons of Dallas I've seen. It wasn't a nightmare to watch--I'm looking forward to season 10 just to see exactly lost I am in the characters that I grew to love in season 9. It's a shame all the character development from this year was a dream! I bet some of the actors felt the same way. I grew to respect Sue Ellen a lot this year. I guess she'll still be a confused drunk when season 10 begins.",1237593600,,1181,4.397260273972603

Some of the newer characters were less than desirable,which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1232928000,,361,4.294117647058823
3391493,4,B0016I0AGY,"The title above pretty much sums up the so-called ""dream"" season.  In almost every episode the name of Bobby Ewing,"" formerly played by Patrick Duffy since the show's debut, is mentioned.  It seems that from the start, the producers did not want viewers to forget the character, hoping that the actor associated with the part would change his mind and return to the fold.

Even though the events of Season Nine - actually the EIGHTH full season -apparently didn't happen, it is still an entertaining one... well, at least the first half is.

It heralds the return of Barbara Bel Geddes as beloved ""Miss Ellie.""  It is obvious that the writers would ecstatic about the actress's return and they saddled her with some delicious dialogue and scenes that demonstrated the character, as well as the actress's, strength and compassion.  Her return is most welcome, bringing a bit of ""normalcy"" to a rather ""abnormal"" season.

The ""abnormal"" comes in the form of Barbara Carrera as the mysterious ""Angelica Nero.""  Obviously, trying to emulate ""Dynasty"" with its over-the-top ""Alexis Carrington"" (played with relish by Joan Collins), ""Dallas"" introduces Carrera, an international beauty and actress, as a woman with a plot of deception and murder that involves J.R. (Larry Hagman) and Jack Ewing (Dack Rambo).  During the run of the season, Carrera gets to wear some of the most outlandish - but stylish - clothes in the history of the medium which add to the character's personality.  It's like the writers are saying to the audience that this women deserves to be noticed 'cause - as the season develops - she's not one that needs to be ignored.

The season also sees the departure of Martha Scott's recurring role as Sue Ellen's (Linda Gray) mother, Patricia, along with the assumed ""riding-off-into-the-sunset"" departure of female viewer's favorite ""Dusty Farlow,"" played by Jared Martin.  Scott, an actress with a long career in film and television, gets to shine in the episodes ""Mothers"" and ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.""  Martin is there most to provide support for Gray's ""Sue Ellen"" as that character battles - and ultimately conquers - her alcohol demons.

Besides Carrera, the season also boasts some ""drop-bys"" by other notable actors.  Oscar winner George Chakiris (""West Side Story""), character actor Raymond St. Jacques, ""S.W.A.T's"" Steve Forrest, and Russell Johnson, forever engrained in TV audiences as ""The Professor"" on ""Gilligan's Island,"" make an appearance or two on the long-running drama.

Marc Singer joins the cast as ""Matt Cantrall,"" a friend of Bobby's that concocts a plan the leads Pam (Victoria Principal) to the jungles of South America to find emeralds.  Because Singer's height and build, along with 80's haircut, is similar to fellow castmate John Beck (""Mark Graison""), their scenes together seem almost mirrorlike, with the exception of Beck's trademark mustache.

As mentioned earlier, the first half of the season is the best.  The second suffers with the Angelica Nero storyline being dragged out too long and the ""How-crazy-is-she-going-to-get"" one dealing with Jenna Wade, played by Priscilla Presley.

But, even with those two elongated plots, the season still shows that there's still life left in the show, even with the ""death"" of Bobby one year earlier.  Even though it's a television drama, the writers manage to interject some responsible commentary on adoption, animal rights, alcohol abuse, and blood donation.

'Not bad for a show with ""oil"" in its veins.",1232755200,,3503,5.173758865248227
3391494,5,B0016I0AGY,"Season 9 of DALLAS is a must have - it is a true snapshot of the early to mid-80's.

The storyline is great, if a bit over the top.  The  writing was excellent,and seeing the episodes back to back you can appreciate that the writers were truly telling a long-term story.

(compare this to the endless Law and Order and CSI shows that we have now...)

DALLAS always had a big budget,and a huge cast- this was the centerpiece of the CBS schedule.  They were in a bit of a war with ABC's DYNASTY, and upped the glitz factor this season.

ABC had Nolan Miller, so LORIMAR hired (Bill) TRAVILLA to costume the cast. TRAVILLA had a spectacular career in film, dressing and creating classic looks for many stars.

TRAVILLA also was the designer for Knots Landing and Falcon Crest, but clearly saved the best for the DALLAS cast.

Some reviewers have been critical of the Marinos storyline, in particular the lovely Barbara Carrera as Angelica Nero.  She was cast as an ultra-vixen, and a seriously smart woman.  She was just as tough (if not more) than JR.

As the story goes on, Angelica becomes truly evil, is given a rest for a few episodes, and then comes back for the final few episodes to cause havoc (and eliminate a few guest stars) for the DALLAS cast.

This season is a keeper,and will be enjoyed by all-- particularly those who did not see it the 1st time around!

A couple of nights ago the Home Theater Forum presented Warner Brothers Home Video (T.V. and Animation divisions only) for a chat. During the forum, Warner Brothers FINALLY said they are giving KNOTS LANDING another chance by releasing SEASON 2 sometime in 2009. Therefore, in order for this series to have continued success, We, the fans and any other curious viewers, new viewers, etc... need to show support to buy this series. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! THE FIRST WEEK SALES WILL DETERMINE CONTINUED DVD SEASON SETS OF KNOTS LANDING.....

Very much like a new movie, when it's released in theaters, the first week opening sales determines if a movie should/could have a sequel. (think in terms of the recent ""Dark Knight"" movie with Heath Ledger) which was a box office hit the first week (and beyond) when it was in theaters this summer. The movie is also coming out with a sequel within the next 2-3 years because of this success.

Therefore if you apply those terms to the first week sales of the DVD release of Knots Landing's 2nd season, it will have continued success, like it's sister show DALLAS. Please, I know the economy has not been the greatest (and it seems to be getting worse) and soon most of us will only be able to watch t.v. at home anyway (instead of going to the movies), please save your money and support this wonderful show. PLEASE BUY THIS THE 2ND SEASON THE FIRST WEEK OF IT'S RELEASE!!! If all is successful, Warner Brothers will continue to produce the remaining seasons of this show as well as another show....FALCON CREST.....that's right, all you FALCON CREST fans out there, according to Warner Brothers chat the other night, sales of KNOTS LANDING will also help determine releasing not only more KNOTS LANDING, but FALCON CREST as well. So FALCON CREST fans.....listen up....check out Knots Landing Season 1 (now) & Season 2 (in 2009)!!! Your show will be next up to bat if you do this.

I hope this helps the fans of both shows understand how important buying your favorite show the first week its release helps determine whether or not the studios will continue releasing a series (and other series). JUST A REMINDER: click on the Amazon's wish list reminder link to let you know when KNOTS LANDING SEASON 2 is released (it's definitely coming in 2009!!). Then when Warner makes the annoucement for the release, Amazon will let you know via email and then you can preorder your copy!! Thanks for reading!!!",1221609600,,2712,4.813304721030043

3391509,5,B0016I0AGY,"Watching the seasons of Dallas including this crazy one, is classic 80's fun.  This is where the uncoming of Dallas begins, but still awesome to watch.",1218412800,,151,4.8076923076923075
3391510,3,B0016I0AGY,"I am a huge 'Dallas' fan and yet I find myself on the fence about this Ninth Season. When stacked up against the previous seasons released, the ninth is just strange, oddly paced and not as exciting and thrilling as the previous ones. Is it good? Yes, of course, but it's just an average good, not the 'great' stamp you could put on the other seasons.

What you'll like about The Ninth Season is how we finally get a break from all the 'fight for Ewing Oil' saga. There is a plot element of this season that I won't spoil that has someone new moving into Bobby's now vacant office, but I never really perceived this as a fight for control as in the previous seasons. With Bobby out of the picture, the show seemed to shift the focus from the Ewing men to the Ewing women. Did it work? I thought so. Linda Gray's performance early on in this season is just beyond words. We get to see Sue Ellen's descent into pure drunkdom and how she falls to pieces as a result. I liked that Miss Ellie (played again by Barbara Bel Geddes) steps in this season and instead of always being whisked away by Clayton to some exotic vacation as in the previous seasons, Miss Ellie stays put at Southfork and realizes that she needs to keep everyone in line. We see a very strong, determined, motherly but wise Miss Ellie pretty much set everyone straight. The other women of the show including Donna, Pam and Jenna all have rather big plot arcs that dominate the season. The show even added a femme fatal character, Angelica Nero, to shake things up. I enjoyed the break from the usual oil and fight for the business plots and the focus being on the family and the characters as they cope with Bobby's lost and try to find new paths and directions in their lives.

What you won't like is the pacing. I found this season to be rather uneven, unfocused, always seeming to shift and switch to different  plots which left me as a viewer feeling jarred and confused. I still don't really understand the entire Angelica Nero plot; she seemed to be added in just to wear fancy clothes and threaten J.R. and Jack Ewing. Then we have Pam in the middle of the season going off to Colombia ... something else that left me wishing the focus of the show stayed on the city and happenings in and around Dallas, Texas. Sue Ellen's sobriety seemed to come too quickly from her departure from the sanatorium. There is also a point in the season where things that happened early on seem to be forgotten; Sue Ellen's re-adjusted quickly and not speaking of her early-season troubles, J.R. oddly goes from wanting to do away with Sue Ellen to being obsessed with re-capturing her heart, Jenna is over-the-top obsessed with Bobby until the final episodes of the season ... it was just confusing and a jumble of plots and odd behaviors and plots.

I won't touch the final episode of the season 'Blast from the Past' though many have already spoiled it. I think it's that episode that really leaves me on the fence about this season. The show appeared to have taken a big chance with many characters and even some plots such as Donna and Ray's pregnancy/child situation, but one episode pretty much undoes it all. An entire season of development, of confrontations such as one between Pam and Jenna that was a major twist, or Cliff finally coming to respect Jamie, undone to be re-written for the next season. Depending on your take of the season, it may have been a good or bad thing.

In all, this season was just okay for me. It is fun to watch knowing that it's a dream because there are sudden hints and allusions dropped throughout the season that hint that most of this is just a dream. There was a grittier feel to at least half the season - the second half felt more soap opera, over-the-top like similar to 'Dynasty' rather than having the drama edge of the past seasons. I also felt the quality of the DVD transfer could have been a bit better. In all, good, but not a great season. Check it out.",1217808000,,3964,4.43956043956044

Meanwhile, we get the late Dack Rambo filling in a bit for Duffy as the macho good guy Jack Ewing; Barbara Bel Geddes returning as Miss Ellie (after a season's absence, during which the role was played by Donna Reed); and guest star Barbara Carerra, exotic, mysterious, and flamboyantly dressed as Angelica Nero. The absence of good guy Bobby as a foil caused nasty J.R. to actually find himself on the side of the angels at times. Sue Ellen has a great story arc that takes her literally from the gutter to a newfound happy marriage with J.R.

It seems like the picture quality has gone down quite a bit from the previous DVD releases and I'm guessing it has to do with Warner Bros. cramming eight episodes onto one disc instead of having six episodes per disc as they have done previously. In order to do that, you would have to compress the episodes even more resulting in poorer picture quality. And that, Warner Bros., SUCKS! This is the kind of crap companies pull that keep consumers from buying cds and DVDs.

Plus, it erased the awful direction the writers were going with the Angelica story.  The one thing that set Dallas and Dynasty apart was that Dynasty, though very entertaining was over the top glamorous and thus somewhat silly, Dallas was down to earth with real characters, and season 9's attempt at emulating Dynasty was it's downfall, not Pam's dream.

The only downside for me, was the difference in time left a disconnect from Dallas and spin off Knots Landing which didn't allow for any future cross overs, except for the Dallas series finale.",1215648000,,655,4.9363636363636365

3391521,3,B0016I0AGY,"Fortunately, the real Miss Ellie is back (in the form of Barbara Bel Geddes) but this is an otherwise strange year.

With Bobby ostensibly dead, new writer/producers took over the show and attempt to make it both more introspective (like spin-off KNOTS LANDING) but also more glamorous (like rival DYNASTY).

The first half of the season almost works--- it's edgier and experimental. But mid-way thru, the plotting just becomes muddled without any direction, and you have characters making nice-nice who never ordinarily would. The scenes become increasingly maudlin, taking on a frankly prissy ""Little-Woman-Fixes-All"" perspective which is riminiscent of the old daytime soaps from prior decades, and it's not an improvement.

By year's end (SPOILER ALERT!!) Bobby re-appears in Pam's shower... Back in 1986, this became DALLAS' biggest cliffhanger since J.R. was shot: how is Bobby alive??

But it was the answer which became THE biggest ""Jump the Shark"" moment in TV history: Bobby's death and the entire subsequent year was all one long dream on the part of Bobby's ex-wife, Pam.

Many long-term viewers tuned-out never came back. The dream scenario became a sitcom punchline for years.

Sure, DALLAS was a ""soap"", but also one of the most influential shows in TV history, and fans were appalled by the use of the dream because it wasn't the kind of device the series was accustomed to previously throwing at their audience.

Suffice it to say, DALLAS never recovered either its audience or the hard-won respect it had earned up until that time. DALLAS had quite literally become a legend in its own time, and critics had eventually been won over by the show, acknowledging it to be a legitimate drama--- until this, an insulting plot contrivance which wound up validating all the ""it's just a soap"" cliches the series had worked so fervently to overcome prior to that.

The use of the dream was the result of petty squabbles between producers, with the fans ultimately left out in the cold. And even to this day, some people close to the show claim that the dream was ""the only way to bring Bobby back"" and that ""the ratings surged up again after the dream scenario was used""....

Neither of which was true at all.",1211068800,,2219,4.927613941018767

3391524,5,B0016I0AGY,"""Dallas"" Season 9 (1985-86)  begins with final goodbyes to Bobby as the Ewing clan come together to pay their respects.  This season sees the departure of Patrick Duffy, as Bobby, and the  return of the much beloved Barbara Belle Geddes, as she reprises her role as Miss Ellie. Donna Reed, of course, exits the show,  and new faces abound as Jenilee Harrison (Three's Company) as Jamie Ewing Barnes, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, Marc Singer as Matt Cantrell, and John Beck returns as Mark Graison.  As mentioned in the previous reviews, ""Season 9"" is Pam Ewing's ""dream season,"" and is quiet enjoyable in it's storyline and characters.  The return of Patrick Duffy as Bobby Ewing in the following season, was no doubt an attempt to boost the shows TV ratings and put it back in the top spot.  ""Dallas"" fans have seen ""the best"" of the series with these 9 season sets, with the shows producers and directors loosing the show's identity with far-fetched shcemes and over-the-top glamour that strays way too far from the original formula that made ""Dallas"" the traditional TV drama that viewers loved to endulge themselves in.  The original formula of TV's ""Dallas"" guaranteed the viewer a season filled with fun and creative storylines which remained in a believable setting that the viewer had not only become familiar with, but enjoyed looking forward to the suspense and drama that came with each episodes deals, plots, and schemes! And as the season came to it's close it always gleefully culminated into a ""season finale cliffhanger"" that left you begging for more!

""Dallas - The Complete Tenth Season"" is probably scheduled for a late Autumn release this year, and will continue where Season 8 left off, which makes this ""Season 9"" sadly ""obsolete.""  I just don't understand how the show's writers could simply toss out Season 9's storylines and happenings and think that the show wouldn't be damaged in some way by it?  Bobby Ewing was a great part of the ""Dallas"" cast, however, his resurrection became the death of it.",1207612800,,8794,4.85809906291834
3391525,5,B0016I0AGY,"As it was expected the 9nth season of dallas will be released this coming summer. A turning point in the dallas saga as this season was the first to drop out of nielsen's top 5 since the ""who shot j.r"" season 6 years ago. Dallas was the NO 1 or NO 2 show for 5 years from 81 to 85 but beginning with the ""dream season"" ratings droped due to bobby's departured and to capice's involvement who wanted WRONGLY to make dallas more like a ""dynasty"" series.
 Next season was the last to include all of the original cast as bell geddes was back from this season and bobby returned in the 1986-1987 season so except for lucy all others were present in dalla's 10nth season but it was already too late because the soap-crazed era was at an end. Dynasty finished the 86-87 season at #24 as all other soaps like falcon crest and knots landind finished in low positions and only dallas managed to finish at #11 which was a triumph for a series 10 years old BUT as i said the damage was already done and at the end of the season victoria principal announced she was leaving due to personal reasons and this was the beginning of the end. Susan howard also left and in the next 11nth season it was the turn of steve kanaly and priscilla presley. In the 12th season linda gray left and when the show reached it's final 14nth season two years later ONLY 3 of the original cast members were still present. patrick duffy, larry hagman and ken kercheval. As i said dallas finished at #11 in it's tenth season, at #22 in it's 11nth season, at #30 in it's 12th season and it's last two seasons were out of the top 40 so it was canselled in 1991.
 Enjoy this season which was to become a dream and wait for the next season which was the last season of dallas that all original cast were present in the post jim davis era except only for tilton who was to come back in 1988.
 In my opinion dalla's final demise started after victoria left the show and other cast members followed her as ratings were droping fast because it was the end of the soap-crazed era and because mr. Capice tried to change dallas into something it wasn't but that's another matter.
 In this season everybody mourns bobby, mark graison is back from the ""dead"" but don't forget that all is pam's dream so we wait the next season to see what really happened after the ""supposed"" bobby's death.
 Until then enjoy another great DREAM SEASON OF DALLAS.",1207353600,,2397,4.341517857142857
3391526,5,B0016I0AGY,"Ah the controversial dream season arrives! I guess we're not in Dallas anymore Toto. For that alone this deserves a five-star rating. Admittedly, many (if not all) Dallas fans were deeply conflicted about the show's attempt at adding a bit of gloss to the sudsy goings-on at Southfork. The void left in the wake of Patrick Duffy's departure would be felt throughout the season despite the extra testosterone supplied by Dack Rambo, Marc Singer and the return of John Beck. Interestingly enough, the show's original premise was to have Bobby die following his wedding to Pam, leaving the grieving widow to deal with the Ewings. And while the powers-that-be kept flirting with the idea (Mr. Hagman certainly played it this way for most of the show's run), even going so far this season as to set the perfect stage - the battle between Pam and JR never quite materializes - ill-veiled threats from both sides notwithstanding. While most of the new ideas meant to revitalize the show ultimately caused a kind of dissonance to its brand, they, at the least, made this particular season stand out. Frankly, had I been faced with trying to create excitement for the show at this point, why bother with Angelica Nero? I'd have negotiated a cross-over storyline with Dynasty. Imagine JR and Alexis playing a corporate ""Strangers on a Train"" deal of you destroy my enemy and I'll destroy yours. Nielsen would've blown a fuse! But I digress. This season is well worth Pam's extended REM cycle with enough intrigue and melodrama to keep everyone on tenterhooks until she flings open that shower door and finds there's no place like home.",1206748800,,1625,4.870036101083032
3391527,5,B0016I0AGY,"Well, here we are finally, at the release of the famous dream season.  Now, after my last review where I got down on the last season, I found upon re-watching it that it was really quite good-I think all of Dallas is brilliant in it's way really.  So, this season is different to be sure-Leonard Katzman was gone and the style of the show went very glamorous, very Dynasty-esque, and it is not at all like Dallas of before or after in many ways.  Lucy is gone and that doesn't matter of course, but Bobby is also gone and that does indeed make a difference.  The season itself has of course been hampered in retrospect by the fact that we now know none of it really happens.  Nevertheless, there are still plenty of interesting twists and turns that keep the season good dramatically.  The only question is how you will react to the different ways that the characters speak and act, and that I've found is more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  I am not going to lie that this is probably my least favorite season of the show for these reasons I've listed above-but it still beats almost anything else from other shows, and it's still Dallas so it gets 5 stars, especially after I was pleasantly surprised by my re-viewing of the last season on DVD.  With Barabara Bel Geddes back as Miss Ellie, and also starring Jared Martin as Dusty Farlow, Steve Forrest as Ben Stivers, Deborah Shelton as Mandy Winger, Jenilee Harrison as Jamie Ewing Barnes, Dack Rambo as Jack Ewing, Marc Singer as Matt Cantrell, and John Beck as Mark Graison.",1206576000,,1547,4.519713261648746
