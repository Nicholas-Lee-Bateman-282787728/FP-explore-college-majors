8424851,3,B004D7SB3E,"""How Smart Are Animals?: Nova scienceNOW"" is an interesting documentary based upon scientists' data regarding four different animals: dogs, dolphins, cephalopods, and parrots. The demonstrations in the documentary are rather impressive, though I believe the film only scratches the surface and tactfully selects species whose intelligence cannot be denied. I wonder if research has been done to see if animals considered to be of lesser intelligence (e.g., squirrels, robins, turkeys, etc.) also perform higher order cognitive processes. Simply put, it seems the documentary elected to take the easy way out. Its other flaw is that it's too elementary for adults yet too complicated for younger children, making it tough to fully please many audiences. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable little feature for animal lovers.",1434844800,,818,5.658536585365853

8424855,5,B004D7SB3E,"My daughter, 8 and my son, 11 love this video. It discusses dolphins, african grey parrots and sheep herding dogs, and was a very worthwhile purchase.",1395100800,,150,4.8076923076923075
8424856,5,B004D7SB3E,"The program examined the abilities of dogs, dolphins, octopus, and Alex the parrot. Dogs are more responsive to human cues than than apes, and more tolerant of humans than wolves. The program showed a dog that, when commanded to find something never taught before, could infer what that was on the basis of eliminating all the items it already knew. Dolphins were shown to be able to create a new trick when so directed. Octopus can problem solve - eg. figure out which way to unscrew a lid, how to do camouflage, and think of using a shell as something to hide in.

Alex the parrot lived half a normal life of 60 years. He could count up to eight, distinguish between colors, shapes and objects, identify what was different, the same, or bigger, knew 100+ words.",1339286400,,763,4.569343065693431
8424857,4,B004D7SB3E,"The work explores why some animals can do things that human toddlers or children can do.  I'm having a bit of deja vu because I swear I've seen a program similar to this.  Of course, they explore dolphins and dogs, but to a lesser extent monkeys, surprisingly.  What's great is that the work explores non-mammals as well.  It speaks of octopusses, parrots, inter alia.

The work tries hard to differentiate between rote learning and actual problem-solving.  It showed how dogs understand the meaning of humans' pointing, but monkeys do not.  It speaks of those animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror.  I'm still stumped at some of the things they call smartness.  They show an octopus camoflaging itself and ask, ""Gee!  Isn't it so smart?""  Well, it worked with what it had.  If I had wings, I'd fly.  If I had a long neck, I'd try to eat fruits or leaves from the tops of trees.  It does point to the large brain size, but sometimes there seems to be holes in their argument.

The work concludes by showing a female researcher who spent 30 years studying one smart parrot.  The work admits that she needed many grants and got few of them.  However, I don't understand how one person could work with such a small sample.  I think universities like studies that are repeatable with the chance to generalize.  Yes, she picked this parrot out of the blue, but it still could have been Parrot Einstein.  Her method(s) didn't seem topknotch to me.

If you like this documentary, you should surely see ""Ape Genius.""",1302739200,8,1520,4.639097744360902
