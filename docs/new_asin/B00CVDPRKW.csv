5742824,5,B00CVDPRKW,"Although I have not received my video yet, I love taking the MS Yoga Class.  Jennifer is an excellent instructor and now with the video, I can practice Yoga better at home.  As one reviewer stated, this video is good for anyone with any type of neurological condition.  The stretching and easy movements, like cat/cow, leg opener #4, down dog, etc. helps with spasticity and weak muscles.  A daily routine of some form of Yoga helps tone muscles and builds stamina.  Thank you Jennifer and Scott for taking the time to do this for us!",1377129600,,534,4.578947368421052
5742825,5,B00CVDPRKW,"While this video's main target is for those with Multiple Sclerosis... I can see how it would be a benefit to anyone, no matter their physical state.  It could be for those with an array of physical limitations, whether it be muscular, nervous, problems with the joints, or even for those with weight issues.  It can even be for those who have time limitations, as there is an excellent 5 minute yoga practice included, I can tell you, this set of exercises feels GREAT!  Anyone can take just five minutes out of their day to do something that makes the body feel amazing (I certainly hope).

The instructors in the video are knowledgeable, and come across as compassionate and really care about the people they are trying to help, they do an excellent job of explaining why they do certain poses and the benefits of doing them.  I like that aspect because I enjoy learning about such things.

Also included is an interview with a Physical Therapist... I found this section to be full of good information for those with MS... while I do not have MS.. my dad does, and I can see how getting an in depth look at how yoga can benefit those with MS could bring a new level of awareness to what is going on inside the body, making the practice all that more helpful.

Overall, I can highly recommend this video to not only those with MS, but for anyone, looking for gentle, simple ways to improve not only their health, but their lives.",1372809600,5,1431,4.480769230769231
5742826,5,B00CVDPRKW,"I do not have MS but this video sounded like something I might like so I purchased it.  I found it to be just what I needed.  I have back issues and after a couple of times using this video, my back feels wonderful.  It is gentle and slow so I even have my 86 year old mother doing it too and she says she can really feel a difference.  This video is indeed for anyone and everyone.  You won't be disappointed.",1372032000,3,410,3.951219512195122
8586774,3,B00CVDPRKW,"I went into a frenzy when I was first Dx. with MS this past January and ordered everything I could get my hands on. I can see this being a great DVD for some people, but now that I have recovered from my first exacerbation I find myself a lot more stronger with better balance, mostly from my physical therapy. I have since joined a gym so I can do some weight training and a lot of water aerobics. I still recommend this DVD for a lot of people with weakness, spastic muscles, and balance issues. If you have MS and find yourself at a stronger point in your recovery you might find this DVD to not have enough more powerful strength training.",1465776000,,643,4.235772357723577

8586776,5,B00CVDPRKW,"I've been looking for a yoga video for people with MS. I have about 4 now -- and this is tops. Include sequences for sitting, matt, standing. It shows alternative ways to do a pose as needed. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the teachers in 2 special sections--one showing a 5-minute sequence for a short, daily practice (and not get too tired), the other showing how a caretaker can help the patient do stretches.  I love it! Karen",1448150400,3,434,4.564102564102564
8586777,5,B00CVDPRKW,"I love it! I can do chair yoga, floor yoga, fatigue, breath, and posture, and floor/standing combinations. I really like the fact that I can do 7 minutes of breath and posture or 27 minutes of chair yoga. I'm very happy with this product. And even got a post-it note from Chuck thanking me. I am 68 years old, had MS for 29 and glad I found a MS video I can handle.",1438041600,2,365,4.013698630136986
8586778,4,B00CVDPRKW,"Beginning clear, but slow in explaining some so rather  annoying; but overall it is good.",1424563200,,89,4.933333333333334
8586779,3,B00CVDPRKW,"After I read all the 5 star reviews for this DVD, I was hopeful that it could help me in my daily struggle with MS.  I'm sorry, the folks who made the DVD seem like nice people, but I didn't find it very useful.  It was hard to see exactly what they were doing.  Although they alluded to getting ready for the relaxation portion--a standard section in all the MS yoga videos--there was none.

There is an interview with Chuck, the instructor, who inexplicably led none of the exercises.  It was hard to hear what he was saying during the interview; it sounded like his voice was caught in a vortex or someone was running a vacuum cleaner nearby.  Maybe it was just my copy.  The interview with the physical therapist was decent.  The woman who led the exercises was low-key and seemed a bit uncomfortable with what she was doing or perhaps being on camera. I liked the range of patients participating in the yoga class.

I guess I was looking for more, and something I could use as a daily practice.  If I lived nearby, I can imagine it would be helpful to attend the classes they offer.  I just can't figure out how to do it successfully from a distance.",1413936000,5,1155,4.375586854460094
8586780,5,B00CVDPRKW,Highly recommended! Great workout for all who have multiple sclerosis. Wod buy again for myself or a loved one with MS.,1392940800,,119,4.714285714285714
8586781,5,B00CVDPRKW,I have been taking this MS Yoga class for years. The class is the best thing I ever did for my MS. The DVD is an excellent introduction to a way of dealing with stress and mobility issues whilst leaving you with a strong sense of control over what you are doing. Highly recommended.,1381190400,4,282,4.2407407407407405
8586782,5,B00CVDPRKW,"Real Yoga for MS has really changed my life. I have been taking MS Yoga for years now and cannot imagine my life without it. I always wished I could remember all the moves, now I don't have to. This DVD along with my wonderful MS Yoga class with Jennifer has helped me to center my life, be patient learning my different abilities, listen to my body, and regain my confidence in my physical abilities. Even when I have a very painful, hard day I am thankful to have this DVD ready to go to guide me with breathing exercises and modifying poses to suit my needs for that day. This DVD has helped me to focus even more on my mind and body at home! Thank you for this wonderful DVD!",1379721600,,679,4.151515151515151
8586783,5,B00CVDPRKW,"This program is very useful for anyone to use. I like that there are multiple chapters to choose from (chair and floor). The 5 minute Yoga practise eliminates the ""I don't have time"" excuse. The discussion with the physical therapist was very informative. I feel that my posture is better and it is good to focus on breathing throughout the time you are practising. I appreciate Chuck and Jen's work to put it all together. It is grat!",1377561600,,435,4.589743589743589
