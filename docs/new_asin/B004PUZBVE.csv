8437792,5,B004PUZBVE,"Sally Eilers plays a working-class girl who meets James Dunn at Coney Island. Through various twists and turns, they end up getting married and having a child. Along the way, there are several misunderstandings brought about by not being straight with each other.

I liked Sally Eilers' performance very much. I also enjoyed the film because you never knew what was going to happen. It was like the camera was a fly on the wall following them through life. The characters all felt very human especially when their emotions conflicted with their minds. For example, James Dunn constantly railed against marriage and children, but ended up having them despite his beliefs. He revealed himself to be a good man, though he pretended to be gruff.

Several times, I thought disaster was going to strike. When Eddie spent his life savings on the house and furniture, it seemed like it was going to end badly. I wondered why Dot didn't tell him the truth?

I felt this was a wonderfully heartwarming story of a couple who loved each other and tried to make each other happy.",1528243200,,1066,4.751351351351351
8437793,4,B004PUZBVE,I collect pre-code films so I purchased this one. It's not great but it's pretty good - especially for fans of old films and/or pre-code movies.,1506297600,2,144,4.576923076923077

8437796,5,B004PUZBVE,"Love the film. Oscar well deserved. 1931 Precode is most entertaining. Well acted and wonderfully shot. The storyline keeps you looking forward to the next scene. Always enjoyed James Dunn's work on screen. Sally Eilers brings charm to the film. I happy to have this Blu-ray edition in my Classic Hollywood film library. The print is as good as it will be. One scene on the Ferry
has a second or two missing though all the audio is intact. I highly recommend.",1485648000,6,459,4.609756097560975

8437798,5,B004PUZBVE,"Director Frank Borzage won an Oscar for this 1931 film and, in this case, it was well deserved. I will avoid describing the storyline because a great deal of the enjoyment for the viewer is in lining up the film with its title (and especially the artwork on the cover of the DVD case). Suffice to say, the film is witty, charming, intelligent and full of surprises. Its subject-matter may be highly familiar, but Borzage's treatment is fresh and full of humanity. The print used here is quite good (and the sound is excellent) although it shows some damage. This should not discourage you from seeing it...and more than once.",1467158400,15,625,4.6909090909090905

8437800,5,B004PUZBVE,"Pretty much forgotten or dismissed as dated and sentimental this 1931 Oscar Winner for best director (and Best Picture nominee) holds up very well for me.  Unexpected glints of grit and depression era realism and some great acting help raise it to undiscovered classic level.

A must see if just for the raw and heartbreaking performance of future Oscar winner James Dunn.",1323302400,5,372,4.983870967741935
