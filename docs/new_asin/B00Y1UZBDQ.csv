7207456,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,Beautiful understated movie with exceptional musical score.,1452124800,2,59,7.571428571428571
7207457,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"Maybe SPOILER ALERT ! Boy meets girl, boy & girl fall in love, boy lets girl know he was sent to betray her, girl dumps boy, boy gets hurt defending girl, girl takes boy back. With a twist. It was a really cute love story, but I don't understand why people had to ACTUALLY SEE her differently. The pheromones could have acted on them and still they could have seen her as she was. The pheromones would have made HER the woman of their dreams, no matter what she looked like. But that is my inner science nerd coming out. Nobody famous int he movie, but still well acted and it got the point across.",1452124800,2,598,4.208695652173913
7207458,1,B00Y1UZBDQ,"Vinessa does a decent performance of the main character. The actors and actresses other than Vinessa do not project any emotions. In general, terrible casting. Weak story development. It seems like a low budget movie.",1450915200,3,217,5.228571428571429
7207459,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"""Siren"" tells a very soft, emotional story that explores both the perils and rewards of love, sexual desire, and companionship. The characters have an almost melancholy appearance which contrasts the very dark circumstances of Peyronel's fairy tale. The protagonist has a sad existence, self-exiled from people and the world in order to just live a safe life and fulfilling life. As fulfilling as a creature could live considering that one's very existence creates a desire so strong that it becomes dangerous to be around men, and in women there is a hatred so deep that connection with other females is equally dangerous.

I love the story, the characters are so tragic, like poor little lumps of lost emotions just wondering the world longing for something more. The cast give very haunting and compelling performances of the characters, and really are what pull you into this dark fantasy. ""Siren"" does have some tense, slightly thrilling moments. For the most part though, this is really just a suspenseful, and dramatic character study. One that is inspired by a mythical being trying to live a very typical life- as typical as a mythical creature's life could be. What makes Peyronel's story so entertaining and compelling is that the story focuses more on a scientific and biological occurrence that gives rise to Leigh's ""siren"" like qualities as opposed to one of a mythical creature lurking about man's world. Almost as if this scenario could be similar to the one eons ago that gave rise to Siren lore.

Overall ""Siren"" is a melodrama more than a thriller. It is a very good film that is total modern fantasy. The atmosphere is at times very ""Nicholas Sparks"", but a bit darker. The cast are great and the settings are beautiful, whimsical slices of creativity and art. The biggest draw for me personally was Leigh's love interest Robert Kazinsky, and the whole science fiction element surrounding the company that Leigh sold her pheromones to. The story does move slow, and there isn't a heavy horror element to the movie so that will be a downer for most horror driven fans. I would say if you occasionally like the modern fantasy/fairy tale themes with a bit of Nicholas Sparks mixed in then ""Siren"" is a perfect film. I enjoyed it,",1442016000,8,2247,4.87958115183246

7207461,3,B00Y1UZBDQ,"imaginative concept; lovely scenery, gardens house and forest. Darkly charming how each man saw Leigh with a different face, nicely done. Gaps here and there and the ending was blase' Probably would not recommend.",1528243200,,213,5.294117647058823
7207462,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,Unique. It is a bit slow but its unique and elequently done. I recommend if you're looking for something different.,1526342400,,115,4.8
7207463,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"A good watch for an evening in. It is a bit on the slow side, so if you're looking for something with a lot of action or a large fantasy world this might not be a good choice. It's a fantasy more rooted in reality, instead of a magical 'siren.' I think it's an interesting exploration of the perils of love, how obsessive and crazy it can be and how even when you love someone you may still harm them because of your love for yourself.",1524873600,,435,4.069767441860465

7207465,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,This is what has been missing in modern movies.  Good simple story telling.  Acting and production were OK.  But great script and good pace.,1524009600,,140,4.75
7207466,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,Very good movie. The sirens ability could've been explored more but you get the basics of it so you can understand her pull on all humans.,1521936000,,138,4.346153846153846

7207473,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,Very good and different ideas... I wish there was more story. This has enough for a whole series if developed correctly.,1517270400,,120,4.761904761904762
7207474,3,B00Y1UZBDQ,"Wow, did that go downhill fast. What started out as a 4-star movie with pretty good acting and an interesting take on the Siren theme, devolved into a ridiculous caricature with a ""twist ending"" that you'll see coming about halfway through the movie. It made the entire climax of the movie predictable and boring.

While the first half of the movie was perhaps slow, it did build the story and develop the characters (a bit). But the last half was so rushed the writers didn't even bother to fill-in any plot holes and even the characters themselves became head-scratchingly ridiculous.

This movie left me regretting watching and feeling cheated by the haphazard way the story was handled.",1517184000,,690,4.888888888888889

7207478,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,I enjoyed this movie.  I haven't seen anything like it in theaters and that is a rarity these days.  I'd say definitely give this a watch.  It was a good lazy Sunday movie.,1516492800,,172,4.151515151515151
7207479,2,B00Y1UZBDQ,"I like Vanessa Shaw. I also like the idea of a sci-fi femme fatale, a lot. But this seemed like a student film. The theme music plays so often it's less like a theme and more like a repetitive noise. When Guy is in the hospital, the sound of the machines includes a respirator. There are quite a few shortcuts taken here. When Agnes gets up out of the bath, she wears the bubbles like a visor and delivers a line that sounds like comedy. The camera pans pointlessly up and down when Guy first comes in the house. I could go on, but it's details like this that let me down. I started to feel silly watching it, like I'd been tricked into spending an hour and a half watching the equivalent of a 99 cent romance novel.",1516320000,,716,4.158273381294964
7207480,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"An enjoyable film that could have been more. The filmmakers could have had some fun with her power on what some people see (i.e. everyone only sees young, beautiful women?). The plot would have worked better following the old story ""Goose that laid the golden egg."" Small town whose main factory makes perfume. Old man protecting the woman while acting as a father figure, but dies into the film. Business taken over by son who pursues wants to ""harvest"" her ability (i.e. kill the golden egg laying goose). The two men (really, the company sends men even knowing what this woman unconsciously does to men) trying to catch her just don't work as well as the film needs it to work.",1515974400,,680,4.628099173553719

7207482,2,B00Y1UZBDQ,"SPOILER ALERT! Liked it at first but ... Honestly, how can two people get away scott-free by driving into the sunset in a dead mans car after killing his wife and leaving his son living without parents? Watch the movie and you will understand this totally bizarre movie ending screw up!",1515974400,,286,4.627450980392157

7207485,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,It's a good sci fi drama. Plot is good. Acting is not too bad. The low budget does show but you'll be able to get over it.,1515456000,,122,3.5555555555555554
7207486,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"The film impresses with a clever story and persuasive characters. Most of all, it shows how much can be done with a tiny budget if you have the skills. Shaw was excellent, Kazinsky OK.  The weaknesses were evident when the story line moved away from the main characters, becoming wooden and crudish. The city folks did not have to be made into zombies.",1515196800,,352,4.587301587301587

7207489,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,"I was startled to find that some reviewers were bored or unimpressed by this film until I read one review which suggested that there are probably viewers whose idea of a movie means action and special effects.
In the plot of Siren, the first thing that is pointed out is how some people are dealt a rotten hand in life, and then how there will always be someone looking to take advantage of those people.  The movie is a series of life lessons -- I'm guessing the ""meh"" reaction in some of the reviews is due to the very understandable, natural reactions by the characters to their experiences.  No cars, trains, or spaceships blow up, and no otherworldly mysteries are revealed, which might be a drag if you're looking for chaos porn.
I gave this film five stars because the characters are relatable, and the teller of the tale did an excellent job of bringing the story to life.",1514160000,11,880,4.528301886792453

7207493,4,B00Y1UZBDQ,"It was a great story. The first 3/4 of the movie was very entertaining but how it ended was a bit too easy and predictable.  The actors were great, they did their part right.  However, the writing at the end seemed rushed and stupid.  I still give it a 4/5 though because the story was a great idea.",1512777600,3,299,4.120689655172414

7207498,3,B00Y1UZBDQ,"It was ok.  The actors were good, but the movie itself seemed b-ish.  There were a few continuity errors, especially at the end.  It's not an 'on the edge of your seat' sort of movie.  I really can't say any more than 'it was ok'.  I had no significant feelings while watching this.  It was just ok.",1511222400,2,299,4.157894736842105

7207503,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,"Haunting, considering all the recent exposs about male entitlement, violence, unwanted male advances toward women and earlier global discussions about burqas, chadris, and paranjas. Supremely disappointing, in that it places the onus of male domestic violence on female physiology, regardless of female intention or desire. Interesting in the exploration of the reactions of the townspeople to the woman with no control over her effect on others. Frightening that the protagonists only logical recourse is either to be a recluse or to find an ultra-violent male protector who is immune to her biology. Ironic that she wears a burqa in America for self-protection in public.
It confirms my belief that hormones and pheromones are extremely powerful and somewhat toxic.",1510358400,,767,5.508474576271187

The idea behind the plot is rich. I felt like the writer could have dug deeper and made this script outstanding if they had only taken the time to put that extra pinch of effort into it. I went from thinking that this movie might be good to thinking that it might get better to realizing that I have just wasted 90+ minutes of my life that I will never get back.

7207547,5,B00Y1UZBDQ,"""Siren"" is well directed, filmed and acted. Unlike other reviews, I saw the character development as solidly balanced with the mystique of movie's plot, tempered with enough intrigue, to meld into a well-formed production. The chemistry between the lead actress Vinessa Shaw and actor Robert Kazinsky was palpable, and left the viewer rooting for them to overcome each other's circumstance to find love, acceptance and finally contentment with each other. The filming, cinematography, sound, and editing were on par with any major motion picture.",1505433600,,546,5.511904761904762

Slowly delving into the turmoil living such a life would cause the siren herself this tale is excellently executed with great scenery/photography, on point acting and a great script and subplots.

I'm giving it five because they avoided the trite ending it seems almost all modern tales of this nature fall trap to - the exciting car chase at the end.  So very nice to see writers and directors are still capable of telling a thought provoking story without using any effects at all, only cinematic narrative.

7207597,3,B00Y1UZBDQ,"I would have loved to see the details of the Siren's ""condition"" explored more fully. What were the other, military, applications for her pheromones, to which the story alluded?

Plot holes throw the viewer out of the story. For someone who is extremely and uncontrollably attractive she takes uneven pains to mask herself. Given the power of the attraction she exerts, her fence against suitors is woefully rickety, and easily circumvented. It seriously undermines the idea that her chemical lure is universal, and overrides all reason or social inhibition.

Character-wise, for someone living with such a unique condition, this Siren has a flat and uninteresting personality. I'm sure a rationale can be offered for this choice on the part of the writers and director, but the effect is to make the entire story flat as well. Wouldn't it be more interesting if, in an effort to integrate her reality, she had created a somewhat more artistic? mythical? symbol-laden? persona for herself. The premise of irresistible attraction itself invites an atmospheric treatment, rich in sensory and emotional engagement, but this film never makes a serious attempt at either.

The idea of a chemically irresistible woman, with ""it's not their fault / they can't help themselves"" exoneration of all who ""fall under her spell"" could have been explored more deeply, to illuminate our ordinary social attitudes toward women, attraction, sex, and power.  Unfortunately, not.

Lastly, the story arc ended pat and improbable (although perhaps reassuring to conventional emotions), and this blunted the integrity of both theme and plot.

Three stars for the premise and its potential. Two sighs of disappointment for the flat characters/acting, and all the missed opportunity for atmosphere, depth, integrity, and a feast of the senses.",1452902400,4,1819,5.320557491289199
