7797919,5,1572525843,"This is an excellent 3 hour long documentary of the Pioneers of Cinema. It would be more accurate to call it Pioneers of European Cinema as most of it is dedicated to French and Italian cinema. Though there are some early Edison films you won't see ""the Great Train Robbery"" in this film. It is divided into 3 parts, the first covers the very beginnings of cinema but also covers what led up to that event starting with the Magic Lanterns and Zoetropes and so on. The second part covers French cinema, mostly Melies and Pathe. I was delighted to see the Pathe film ""Excursion to the Moon"" which was a direct rip-off of Melies. The third part deals with the Italian Cinema. Some of it is amazing, covering films like ""Nero"" and ""Ali Baba and the 40 thieves"". The only complaint I have about this film is that the narrarator had an accent and I could not always identify the filmamkers names that he was saying. There is alot I have never seen here before, and this set is not available on DVD. Hopefully it will be soon.",1336521600,,1019,4.396825396825397
