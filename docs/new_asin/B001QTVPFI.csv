8336282,4,B001QTVPFI,"I'm into whacky, unique indie/underground flicks and this certainly falls into that category. It's soooooooo weird in the very best way, weaving a sordid tale, sociopolitical parody, and surreal symbolism (that most people will not catch, guaranteed) into an engaging and fun movie. It's not for everyone, but I seriously doubt it was ever intended to be.",1519948800,,355,5.245614035087719
8336283,1,B001QTVPFI,Hack of movie. No decent dialog. Film quality bad. Bad plot. Don't waste you money. Bad actors. No acting. Disappointed,1392595200,,119,5.0

8336287,1,B001QTVPFI,"thanks for trying, but spend this money that you used to make the film on aids research or project angel food.",1364083200,,110,4.285714285714286
8336288,2,B001QTVPFI,"Don't even remember watching it, could not have been very good!  Whoever created this should find another career. Best of luck!",1358380800,,127,5.0476190476190474
8336289,3,B001QTVPFI,i don't remember the last time i saw it but just read the description of the movie and you can tell how bad it is its a movie about theater acters who do badly at there job and nobody pays to see there show does that sound familiar,1339718400,3,231,3.8333333333333335
8336290,1,B001QTVPFI,"Definitely not worth the time to watch.  Acting sucked.  If they were trying to portrait underground movies of the 1960's - they missed the mark. I don't think I have ever seen such poorly trained actors.  Hope they didn't get paid.  There should be a rating of Zero, One star was too good a rating for this crap.",1332633600,2,313,4.344827586206897
