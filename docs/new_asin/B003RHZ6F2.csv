4184645,3,B003RHZ6F2,"GOOD is one of those movies that, unfortunately, aims too high.  If it had tried to be merely a personal drama set against the rise of Nazism, it would have been spectacular.  Unfortunately, it reaches high, purposely intending to be a commentary on guilt and humanity.  This leads to some contrived dialogue and situations that weigh the movie down.

Still, the film has its strong points.  The story of a German professor coping with the pressures to join the Party (and the Party's interest in his novel, and the eugenics preached within), the film provides ample opportunity for its cast to shine.  Viggo Mortensen shines as Professor Halder, giving an understated performance that is admirable.  As his Jewish friend, Jason Isaacs shines; cast against type, he is a wonder in the few scenes he's given.  Jodie Whittaker, as Halder's love interest, holds her own amongst the greats.  The entire cast performs admirably--especially Mark Strong, in his too-brief role.

While the performances are stellar, the rest of the film lags behind.  The plot is non-linear at first, and it's hard to tell when the flashbacks stop.  There is an entire subplot with an infirm mother (acted wonderfully by Gemma Jones) is completely unnecessary; she's used to display Halder's humanity, but if the script had been what it should've been, her character wouldn't have been necessary.  These errors are largely unforgivable, given the effort the cast puts into it.  If the movie had been more modest, hadn't reached for the stars, it would've been much stronger, much more streamlined and accessible.  As it is, GOOD is worth seeing for the acting, but as a morality play, it falls too far short.",1285632000,2,1683,4.982078853046595
4184646,5,B003RHZ6F2,"Although this film depicted events that occurred in the 1930s in Germany as the Nazis have come into power, it is in many ways a cautionary warning of how easily things can change in any society, including our own, once people, no matter how ""good"" they may be, choose to travel step by step down one path over another.

For example, one scene depicted a college literature professor being informed that certain works in his class curriculum were no longer considered acceptable.  At the same time his students were rushing to the classroom window to watch as piles of books were being burned outside.  This scene brought to my mind the recent publicity surrounding the threatened burning of Korans in Gainesville, Florida.  While many probably chalked this up as merely the actions of one misguided individual, there will certainly be others who will now take up his cause.  Recent news stories have also mentioned certain school boards trying to sculpt history books to conform with their own ideas of how American history should be portrayed, rather than how it actually was.  How many of us again took little notice of the story and merely ascribed those actions to a few misguided individuals who, fortunately, live somewhere else?  How many Germans do you think felt the same whenever they read initial news stories of books being burned?

One of the main characters in this film, a Jewish psychoanalyst, is at first spared some of the harshest anti-Semitic Nazi measures due to having served in the German army in World War I.  Tragically, any protection that his status as a war veteran provided him was short-lived.  Many news stories during the recent New York Islamic Center controversy have reminded us that many Muslims have served honorably in our military over the past few years.  How many of today's Beckian conspiracy-minded fanatics will ignore the service provided by these individuals and see them merely as having been engaged as mole agents in some sort of anti-American plot?

I am certain that many of those drawn to the Nazis in the 1930s felt that they were ""good"" and patriotic citizens.  I am sure that many of the ""good"" Americans waving their Tea Party flags at their rallies feel the same way.  Nevertheless, the same sort of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric being spewed and ingested daily by many of these ""good"" Americans is very similar to the anti-Semitic propaganda that brought the Nazis to power and kept them in power.  Don't think that it can't happen here, in many ways it already is.",1285459200,9,2534,4.88785046728972
4184647,4,B003RHZ6F2,"Viggo Mortensen is a chief exponent of the Block-of-Wood School of Acting, but he is perfectly cast as Professor ""Johnnie"" Halder, a Professor of Literature and novelist in Hitler's Germany.

As GOOD opens, Johnnie is just like anybody else. He is dealing with a neurotic wife and demanding children, balancing home and work, and is dedicating time to caring for his increasingly frail and senile mother. Hitler has just come to power. He begins an affair with his student, Anne Hartman, more as a distraction than anything else, and maintains his friendship with Maurice Gluckstein, his former psychoanalyst. He decries Nazi book-burnings and dismisses the Fuhrer as a ""joke.""

In an attempt to establish its credibility, the new government is seeking out experts to endorse its policies, and they trip across Johnnie's sensitively written 1920s novel of a husband who aids his terminally ill wife in an assisted suicide.

Although Johnnie despises Naziism he is flattered by the attention paid to his novel, and accepts (with misgivings) an honorary commission in the SS. This opens the door to promotions at the University. He becomes Dean of Literature after the former Dean, Herr Mandelbaum ""leaves in such a hurry.""  He is tapped to inspect facilities for the care of the mentally ill, based on his ""humanitarian"" writings.

Despite pressure, he continues to befriend Maurice, who is becoming more and more bleak as time passes. He does attempt to arrange for his friend to leave Germany, but he is stopped from purchasing a ticket to Paris. Finally, he loses track of his friend in 1938, right after Kristallnacht.

Throughout GOOD, Johnnie IS ""good,"" but he becomes increasingly blind to what is happening around him as he travels down the slippery slope that eventually takes him to Auschwitz on an inspecton tour.

Never evil, Johnnie Halder is an Everyman who goes along, accepts what he told without question, and is increasingly co-opted by flattery and comfort. In the end, he comes to realize that he is stumbling through a waking nightmare of which he in part created. Not judgmental of its protagonist, GOOD invites us to question just what a ""good"" man is and does and where the bounds of responsibility lie.",1284854400,107,2226,5.016260162601626
4184648,4,B003RHZ6F2,"A new movement for change, promising a life richer in education, physical prowess, diminished crime, and  increased wealth is like a magnet, and the promises that National Socialist Republic created in all forms of the media in the 1930s were probably heady enough that the post World War  I Germans could turn a blind eye to the vacuous reality of a rising maniac's promises.  GOOD is a film that suggests how the good common people responded to the rise of the Third Reich - the Nazi party with its loathsome guardianship in the Gestapo.  It suggests how personal needs could cloud the mind to see only the benefits of a new order that would eventually destroy millions of people and attempt to transform the world in a new social order. And it is painful to watch the disease progress into every aspect of life in Germany.

John Halder (Viggo Mortensen) is a professor of literature and a writer of novels: his latest novel is a fictional story about a man who, out of love for his suffering wife, assists her dying.  This novel catches the eye of Hitler and the Reichminister Bouhler (Mark Strong) who encourages Halder to draft a paper describing how euthanasia is a good and righteous act - a paper that will eventually 'justify' the massacre of Jews and other 'undesirables'. Halder's life is in such upheaval (his mother (Gemma Jones) is dying of tuberculosis while living with Halder and his piano obsessed wife Helen (Anastasia Hille) whom he divorces, Halder finds happiness only with a student Anne (Jodie Whittaker) who is fascinated with the Nazi party, and Halder's only close friend is psychiatrist Maurice Israel Glckstein (Jason Issacs) who is Jewish and loathes the Nazi party.  Because of Halder's needs in life and also because of the glory he feels being praised for his novel, he agrees to be an 'advisor' to the party. His confrres include Adolph Eichmann (Steven Elder) and Josef Goebbels (Adrian Schiller) and slowly the good man John Halder becomes immersed in the Nazi party.

Maurice, being Jewish and detesting John's alliance with the Nazis, must escape Germany as the Jewish purge begins.  His only hope is aid from Halder's Nazi affiliation and he desperately seeks Halder's help.  Halder is unable to come to Maurice's aid; Maurice is evacuated and Halder's inspection of the concentration camps makes him face his worse fear about his selling out his morals and honor and his losing his closest friend.

GOOD began as a play by C.P. Taylor and was transformed into a screenplay by John Wrathall.  Vicente Amorim directs a cast of mixed experience, but from Mortensen and Isaacs and Jones he draws fine performances.  Throughout the film Halder has aural delusions: at times of stress he hears music, a factor that in retrospect makes us question his own stability.  The music he hears is a sad rewriting of the works of Gustav Mahler -' Die Zwei Blauen Augen von meinem Schatz', and 'O Mensch!'  from the Mahler 3rd Symphony (both sung in English translations by people on the street!), bit and pieces of score quoting phrases from Mahler in a very pedestrian arrangement, and finally orchestral recordings of moments from Mahler's Symphonies No. 1 and No. 3.  The pedestrian quality of the score weights the film down. The cinematography  by Andrew Dunn is fine (the film was shot in Hungary).  Overall, it feels like this is a strong idea of a statement of what happens to the minds common men in times of crises. For this viewer it simply doesn't accomplish its goal, despite the worthy attempt Viggo Mortensen makes.  Grady Harp, September 10",1283731200,30,3581,4.840983606557377
4184649,5,B003RHZ6F2,"Despite the fact I grew to quickly despise Viggo's character, I actually really liked this movie. It was acted well, and it showed perspectives of the people directly involved with the Nazi 3rd Riche(Spelling?). It shows how easy it is to end up on the wrong side of the field if one makes one small compromise, then another, then another, the next thing they know, they're sucked into a world they don't want to be in, in a place they don't want to be at.

Jason Isaacs' character was another excellent aspect of the story, how two friends ended up on different sides of the fence when they had fought together in a previous war on the same side. It is heart wrenching, and I cried for a long time even after the movie ended with how things turned out for everyone.

I recommend this movie for EVERYONE to see. It will definitely get you to thinking about where you are and how set in your morals and beliefs. Check it out!",1283472000,5,924,4.366279069767442
4184650,3,B003RHZ6F2,"The film Good starts out with a thoughtful premise.  A university professor writes a book Hitler wants to use to justify killing the chronically ill or mentally disabled people in Germany.  The professor, Viggo Mortensen, has nothing but contempt for the Nazis, but he is a weak man who is flattered by the attention he receives from important people in the SS.  He agrees to write a position paper on euthanasia for the SS and thus begins his slow, but steady downfall as one by one he compromises all that he believes to be good and truthful.

So far, so good.  Unfortunately, the film is badly directed and edited.  It moves forward and backward in fits and starts as we get a glimpse at the professor's dysfunctional family life.  At his core the professor is weak and shallow.  His good friend, a Jewish psychiatrist, is systematically destroyed by the Nazis as the professor watches from the sidelines.  The professor, now an SS man himself, has the power to help his friend, but does nothing - a sad commentary on all the ""good"" Germans who watched as their Jewish friends were first persecuted and then murdered.

The film tries to show how easy it would be for the average German citizen to be taken in by the Nazis, but the professor's story is confusing and badly told.  His life is a muddle, as is his thinking.  This is well dramatized at the very end of the film where we see him perfectly dressed in his SS uniform standing in the middle of a concentration camp wondering how he got there and what  has become of his life.  A badly told story has come to a bad  end.",1283385600,15,1581,4.479020979020979
4184651,5,B003RHZ6F2,"I remember seeing this at an art house cinema earlier this year; looking forward to again watching when we get the DVD. Well-made, but rather frightening film about what can happen when a good man goes to the ""dark side"" of humanity. Viggo Mortensen was well cast as John Halder, a ""good"" citizen who becomes convinced to join the Nazi party. None of the atrocities are shown in much detail; the film leaves it up to the viewer to imagine what was REALLY going on.

A good lesson for any time period, especially today with new/scary political movements, such as the tea brains!",1282608000,4,577,4.601941747572815
4184652,2,B003RHZ6F2,"I am quite a fan of military themed movies but I wasn't mad about this one. It is set in late 1930s and early 1940s Germany and although there is a military element, there are no war scenes, it concerns events in the civilian sphere. The protagonist is a university professor who steadily compromises his principals to get ahead and make his life easier. This is a pretty good topic but it's not explored in the best manner. Some people may have experienced this time in this way but some things seemed quite unlikely. Along the way his decisions and subsequent advancements are contrasted with the awful experiences of his Jewish friend.

The settings and costuming were fairly impressive and seemed to be accurate for the period. It was all acted competently enough too but I didn't find myself connecting with any of the characters. Frankly I found most of them quite unlikeable. Everything is in English and first names are generally quite Anglo, so that makes it accessable for the general public but humourous in ways too - like the senior SS officer called 'Freddie'. 'Good' does examine some interesting themes but not in a way that draws you in - in fact I couldn't wait for it to end.",1281484800,13,1194,4.658767772511848
4184653,2,B003RHZ6F2,"All evil needs... is for Good men to do nothing, says the tagline on the cover of this DVD.  The set up is thus tantalising, promising a tale of moral murkiness, a `what if..' situation to challenge the viewer.  Alas, it fails to deliver.  We meet John Halder, a literature professor in 1930's Germany.  A man struggling with a slightly loopy wife, mother with severe dementia, and a country which is burning the books he loves as it slides inexorably deeper into Fascism.  As a decent man, how will he react to these circumstances?  Well, by keeping the status quo at work, and seeking refuge in the beautiful arms of one of his students, as well as frequent beer drinking sessions with his best buddy, a Jewish psychoanalyst played by Jason Isaacs.  The next step down the path of moral murkitude he takes sees him coerced into joining the Nazi party, due to a paper on euthanasia he has written.  The stresses this puts on his relationship with his best friend, a Jew, is perhaps the best played segment, with Jason Isaacs probably the best thing in the movie.  Of course, events continue to deteriorate and the little choices made at the start begin to have monumental effects on the lives of those around him, until in the end, he is faced with the full horror of what he has done - or rather, what he failed to do.  It could all certainly be fascinating, and the period feel of the movie is fine, the acting up to scratch... and yet, Mortensen plays the character in such an ambiguous way, as such a weak man, that by the time he faces the realisation of what he has done - it is not only too late for him to do anything, but too late for us the audience to care much about it.  Frankly a movie about the Nazi's treatment of the Jews and other minorities which leaves us not caring, has fundamentally failed in its objective.  Oddly, just the idea behind the movie makes you think and ponder more than you do by the time the movie has finished - the movie really adds nothing to the debate, failing for all its attention on the details of his life, to get under the character's skin and thus make the viewer care.
All in all, a movie that fails to live up to its title, despite some interesting ideas and performances.  My advice?  There are plenty of other movies or novels on the topic out there.. this one, while not bad, is certainly not essential viewing.",1267833600,,2366,4.409195402298851

The character John Halder (played by Mortensen) is clearly in denial about the Third Reich and his role in that dreadful war machine.

4184746,3,B003RHZ6F2,"C.P. Taylor's 1981 play GOOD, which is typically performed on an almost bare stage with considerable live music to accompany the story, is very consistently ranked among the finest of twentieth century plays.  Unfortunately, not all plays translate well into movies, and when shorn of its distinctly theatrical style and blown up onto the screen, the result is slow moving and somewhat ho-hum.

Set in 1930s Germany, GOOD is the story of likeable professor John Halder (Viggo Mortensen) who must contend with a mentally ill wife and increasingly senile mother.  His relationship with the two has previously inspired a novel that seems to encourage euthanasia, and when the Nazis come to power they seize upon the book as justification for their own, more extreme ideas in that direction.  Although John disapproves of the Nazis, he is flattered by their interest in his work and joins the party in order to produce further writings.  These in turn gain him more prestige, more money, more career opportunities.  He rationalizes his behavior by a sincere belief Hitler is a fool and the more extreme attitudes of the party will ""blow over"" in time.  In the process, he essentially abandons his wife, his mother, and a Jewish friend, and little by little he is drawn further and further into the darkness, all the while convinced that what he does is for a greater good.

Several of the supporting players are especially fine, particularly Gemma Jones, Anastasia Hille, and Jodie Whittaker; Jason Isaacs is also excellent.  But the film rests on the shoulders of Mortensen, who seems unable to play the character as a genuinely warm, likeable individual.  Since the major impact of the story rests on our reaction to Mortensen's seduction by the Nazis, Mortensen's failure on this point undercuts the entire film.  It feels slow, talky, and a little too casual for full interest.

4184747,3,B003RHZ6F2,"The ending of this movie is cryptic.  I'd like to suggest that it sort of makes sense if we can see it as 'the' deja vue, and all of his previous audible hallucinations were premonitions of that deja vue which had not yet occurred.

His life is fairly chaotic, with two children, and an escapist musician wife, and a senile elderly mother in his house, he's comparatively easy prey for the home wrecker blonde bomb-shell who moves in (nothing subtle about this woman) and becomes wife number two.  It isn't immediately clear from the outset that it's his elderly mother in the home, but her role as an antagonist is contrasted beside his Jewish friend and fellow professor, who like himself is a veteran of the first world war.

One has to expect that the main plot of a friendship between a Nazi and his marginally Jewish friend (he describes himself) is probably not going to end well.  The manner in which things go wrong for them is simply beyond the pall of very bad luck.  Incredibly bad luck. Incredibly bad choices.  Feelings of rage and helplessness.

The review immediately preceding this one misses the point of the film entirely.  They say that the protagonist was a weakling and not the kind of person who would have been a member of the Nazi Party or the SS.  In fact, he was exactly the kind of person who populated the ranks of the Nazi Party:  Morally ambivalent weaklings and cowards with a chronic lack of self-esteem.  Like most bullies and wolf packs, many members of the Nazi party only found their ""strength"" in numbers.  Many where sadistic sociopaths while others were civil servants or academics wallowing in their mediocrity, depending on National Socialism,  like a drug addict, to lift themselves above their shortcomings. Vigo Mortenson does an excellent job and the acting, with a few exceptions, is uniformly good.  The one problem I have with this movie, that is really just a pet peeve of mine when it comes to movies about Nazi Germany, is that all the actors speak with an English accent, including Vigo Mortenson who doesn't have an English accent to begin with.  But I also have a problem with movies, like the Oddessa File, where the actors speak in English, but with bad German accents.

4184756,3,B003RHZ6F2,"Viggo Mortensen is Professor John Halder, a mild-mannered professor teaching literature (including Marcel Proust) at a university in Berlin. It is 1937, at the time of the rise of the Third Reich. One day John is summoned by the head of Nazi Censorship Committee Bouhler (Mark Strong), who tells him John's recent novel (involving the theme of euthanasia) had greatly impressed Hitler himself. Bouhler then asks him to write a paper for the Nazi party.

John's best friend is a Jewish psychiatrist named Maurice Gluckstein (Jason Isaacs). Maurice needs a train ticket to Paris, but to buy one he also needs a permit that his friend John, now furthering his political career, can obtain.

""Good,"" based on a C. P. Taylor play, is a drama about morality. The film's message is clear and universal, but as a drama the narrative falls flat and most supporting characters remain one-dimensional. The character of Anne, a student attracted to Professor Halder (played by Jodie Whittaker, impressive in ""Venus"" opposite Peter O'Toole) is underwritten, and so is Freddie, a Nazi officer played by Steven Mackintosh.

But to me the most disappointing part of the film was the central character Professor John Halder. Viggo Mortensen with his understated performance is not bad, but the way how his character, a ""good"" man seduced by something he initially distances himself from, finally comes to be what he is should be explored more deeply. He is in conflict, but with what?

In short, what the film lacks is credible character development in the protagonist, and perhaps equally importantly, confidence in the material the film deals with.",1329955200,11,1633,5.082089552238806

He abandons all around him, friends and family alike and then attempts to somewhat redeem himself towards the end by making a safe, but ultimately half-hearted attempt to undo the damage...

The acting may be well done and Viggo certainly ain't no slouch in this regard, but I didn't get this movie... and when it ended the way it did, I can't say I was terribly surprised. Grateful perhaps that this odd little story was finally over.

In a world where a criminal endeavor on the scale of the 1930's German Nazi movement is even possible, it's good for movies to explore every angle of the human condition. There will always be stories about WWII and they certainly need not all be about action, adventure, daredevil heroes, explosives and the huddled masses. This movie tries to show how an Everyman can be intellectually seduced by such a movement...

... but for me it ultimately fails because that man is shown here to abandon all that he purports to hold dear, for seemingly no other reason than the lunatics in charge asked him to do so.

4184760,2,B003RHZ6F2,"The true story of the Nazi euthanasia movement has yet to be written, much less filmed, and ""Good"" does nothing to improve that situation. It confuses the euthanasia movement with the mass extermination of the Jews, and confuses the timelines for the development of both. It also blurs some of the major contributors to the program.

Here is a much abbreviated version of the story -

The Nazi euthanasia movement begins in the late 19th Century in the efforts of Americans to improve their medical training in the wake of the deaths during the Civil War. Flash forward to the 1880s and 1890s when American students went to Germany to be educated and came back to the U.S. to eventually head the prominent East coast Medical schools.

The euthanasia movement in the U.S. and the mass sterilizations of the ""feebleminded"" was very strong at the turn of the 20th Century. The first law was passed in 1907 in Indiana. The German physicians were in awe of the Americans who took their theories and actually began to apply them.

Flash forward to the post WW 1 German emphasis on the ""volk"" and the scapegoats for the loss of the war. Then in 1927 the US Supreme Court upheld sterilization laws. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote - ""It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.""

Sterilization spread like wildfire in the US to the point where 60,000+ people were sterilized. The Carnegie Institution encouraged dissemination of this work throughout the world, but especially in Germany where it found most fertile ground. . It's even quoted in ""Mein Kampf"" which was written in 1924. The Rockefeller Foundation was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund German research, including Dr. Ernst Rudin (who became one of Hitler's right hand men) and Dr. Josef Mengele

Back in Germany in 1932 an ambitious Adolph Hitler was making deals with every group he could for their support. The deal with the German Medical Association was to allow them the right to take a life.

January 1, 1933. Hitler takes over and his very first act is to give the German physicians the right to terminate life. July 14, 1933. Germany passes the first sterilization laws, setting up more than 200 Hereditary Health Courts. Within 2 years 1% of the population had been sterilized, half for ""feeblemindedness"".

The sterilization movement preceded the extermination camps, but the target was the same. As early as 1935 the issue came up (killing the ""life unworthy of life""), but Hitler was reluctant to do anything so severe during peace time, but it was clearly on his agenda when war came. In preparation, Hitler began registering all people with disabilities, assisted by IBM. With the outbreak of the war in September 1939, the extermination of the feebleminded was authorized by Hitler in  October. By August 1941 more than 70,000 people had been killed under the authority of Dr. Karl Brandt and Philip Bouhler (his character appears in the film).

To carry out these mass exterminations the Nazi devised various methods including legal injection, carbon monoxide gas delivered in sealed vans, and finally the gas chamber. As the numbers increased so did the targets, now expanded to gypsys, mental patients, relatives of mental patients, and finally soldiers who returned from the Russian front and were severely disabled.

As the killings spread, opposition grew, and in the summer of 1941 there were major disruptions and Hitler announced the end of the extermination program. No sooner had the program been closed than the gas chambers were dismantled and shipped to the concentration camps, where their new targets were the Jews.

Looked at from the POV of history, it's clear that ""Good"" is a distortion of history. That being said, is it a good film? IMO - no. Mortensen is not convincing as an academic, and since he is in almost every scene, this is a problem. Mortensen is a good actor, but his parts in films like ""Leatherface"", ""Carlito's Way"", ""The Prophecy"", ""Lord of the Rings"", etc. are not exactly Ivory tower types. Indeed, if the purpose of the film is to expose the German academics for their complicity in the holocaust, the near complete absence of any feeling about academia speaks against the value of the film.

There are many other problems with the film, including a poor musical score and jumps back and forth in time that can be confusing. But it's not completely worthless - there are fine performances from Jason Issacs as a Jewish friend, Jodie Whittaker as a student, and Mark Strong as Philip Bouhler.

It's good to have films about the Nazis and the Holocaust, but they should be good films and they should try to adhere to history. As I said in my opening remarks, the true story of the Nazi euthanasia movement has yet to be written, much less filmed.",1313971200,9,4944,4.863258026159334

be a good movie.  The acting was good, but nothing was
happening in the first three quarters of the movie.

Perhaps the problem was that there was nothing new here.
The movie consisted of cliche after cliche about Nazis.
Yes the Nazis burnt books, yes the Nazis were trying
to create a strong nation with fertility programs, and
yes they tried to euthanasia the weak and the crippled
to reduce their health care costs to reduce tax burden
and create a stronger military, and yes they had
concentration camps.

After becoming part of the SS, the protagonist tried to
save his friend Maurice.  But this plot was much better
done with the movie Schindler's List.

The ending was so sudden that I was taken by surprise.  We
never find out what happened to Maurice.

If you like movies about characters and their feelings
towards each other, than you could rank this movie two
or even three stars.

Much more satisfying movie about Nazis is 'Inglorious Basterds'
with Brad Pitt (although very violent).  Granted I am comparing
apples to oranges here, but that movie was 'Good', this one

4184787,3,B003RHZ6F2,"MINOR SPOILERS BELOW YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

Viggo Mortensen wonderfully portrays John Halder, a mild-mannered scholar who has no Walter Mitty-like aspirations; he really would just like to be left alone with his books, papers and literature classes. Instead, he's saddled with a demanding and dysfunctional home-life and uncomfortable attention from the Nazis, who ""request"" that he write a serious paper to publicly validate the idea of humane euthanasia about which he wrote a fictional novel some years before. He also has a good friend in psychoanalyst Maurice Gluckstein, who is, of course, Jewish.

I was hoping, at least from what I had seen of the trailers, that it would be more about the friendship of the 2 men who are slowly pulled in different directions due to forces neither of them can control. Instead it is really more about John's life of mounting compromise -- his family, his professional life, a political life he does not want -- only one of which is his friendship with Maurice. Of course, as expected it turns out to be the one compromise with which he has the most difficulty. He does come to realize it and try to correct it, but by then it's too late. After that, the movie ends rather abruptly. We never find out what happens to John or Maurice, only where the filmmakers chose to stop filming. In an odd twist, John appears to hallucinate a certain piece of music 3 or 4 times during the film, but it is not explained to the viewer why this happens or how it is significant to John in particular or the film in general.

Viggo Mortensen shines and rises above everything he appears in and this is no exception; he portrays the sensitive side of any of his characters so believably. Jason Isaacs gets a part he can really chew on and display his talents away from his tiny, bit-part in the Harry Potter movies, but even here he still gets too little screen time. Everyone else is also very good, especially Gemma Jones as John's mentally and physically ailing mother, who in the end does not die the way you expect her to. I'd like to think that this subtly communicates the idea that, in the end, perhaps John didn't totally compromise _everything_ he believed in.",1297728000,6,2193,4.661498708010336

This refreshing insight, which is rarely displayed, gives us a more in-depth feel of not only war, but of human will. It reminds us that if we don't take a stand or open our eyes that we'll have to suffer consequences.
