571019,4,6303120504,"I am an opera lover. The first time when I saw this film, I wanted to see it again. At last, I was able to add it to my collection.
It is the life story of Australian opera star Marjorie Lawrence (Eleanor Parker) who meets an American Doctor (Glenn Ford) in Paris while in school. They meet again in the States and get married. She is stricken with polio but she overcomes it and returns to perform one of the Wagner's best operas.
Eleanor Parker is great and the story is magnificent. I recomend it specially to opera lovers.",1252713600,3,526,4.3232323232323235
571020,5,6303120504,"Excellent telling of the life of Australian Opera singer Marjorie Lawrence,who after reaching the top of her profession,married a Doctor and wanted to give up her career. However professional commitments intervene and whilst abroad rehearsing for an opera,contracts polio. The undeniable star power of Eleanor Parker and Glenn Ford carries this interesting movie along,and the closing moments are extremely moving and powerful. Parker won an Oscar nomination for this,and it's easy to see why. Although Ford is sidelined a bit,he makes all his scene's count,especially the teary final moments. The music is tremendous,the colour bright,and the many costumes reflect the 50's glamour that was so prevalent in movies of that time. Well done. 10/10",1251244800,5,745,5.543859649122807
571021,4,6303120504,"This is a nicely written screenplay.  My main complaint is Farrell's voice.  But then, many probably like it.  For me it makes the opera scenes quite forgettable.  But the portrayal of a woman's ambition, success, maritial comflict, disaster, then a comeback make a good story.  Another slight complaint.  Parker overdid the lipsync.  Extremely handsome is a decades pre Bond Roger Moore.",1250640000,3,388,5.262295081967213
571022,5,6303120504,"Eleanor Parker was alot like Barbara Stanwyck and Kate Winslet who preceded her in that her work was consitently of the highest calibre that there was the tendency to take her for granted.  Her performance in ""Interrupted Melody"" is probably the crowning jewel of her career.  As Marjorie Lawrence, a world renowned opera singer who is subsequently stricken with polio, Parker has to assay both a stage performer and a woman struggling with an illness that cripples both her body and soul.  In the earlier scenes Parker is mesmerizingly coquettish in the opera scenes despite the fact that she is lip synching to the voice of Eileen Farrell.  When illness strikes the film could have veered into mawkishness but Parker keeps the film grounded by avoiding overplaying the scenes.  My favorite scene in the film is when Lawrence is contemplating a comeback by performing at a V.A. hospital.  Her choice of ""Over the Rainbow"" is both inspiring and touching.  Not to be overlooked is Glenn Ford as her supportive husband who sacrifices his medical practice to care for his wife.  This is not just a great musical biography but a great film, period.",1249344000,19,1144,4.891191709844559
571023,4,6303120504,"I think this is a beautiful film, well acted, written and beautifully sung by Eileen Farrell. The opera segments are wonderful and Eleanor Parker has the best role of her career.

It will not play on player/recorders or computers.  It will only work on ""play only"" devices.  That said, I'm happy that Warner is releasing this series of slightly less than marketable titles.  I just wish that, for the price, they played on all equipment.  It is indeed a 16:9 transfer and the color is lush and the sound is good.",1243296000,18,482,4.482758620689655
571025,5,6303120504,"The sound quality of my VHS copy is fine (and believe me, I'm hard to please in that area).  Yes, this movie belongs on DVD in Dolby 5.1.

The story is so good, you'll swear it is fiction.  But it isn't.  A country girl from the Australian outback who becomes a world-famous opera singer?  Come on!  But it's all true.

The first half of the movie is her struggle and rise.  From sneaking off the ranch to an audition (of which her father vehemently disapproves) to her scholarship to study singing in Paris--except that the person she's supposed to study with knows nothing about this and refuses to take her.  How she gets this woman's attention is priceless.

The meeting with the young doctor after her debut at the Monte Carlo opera.  Her big night and no one to share it with!  The doctor agrees to celebrate with her, and the two fall in love.  But she has her life and he has his.  They part.  A few years later, she makes her debut at the Met and everyone is fawning over her.  The doctor comes backstage and congratulates her; but there are so many, she doesn't recognize/remember him until he has walked off, hurt and disappointed.  And...well, you can see, this is quite a story.

The polio occupies the first part of the second half, then there is the story of her struggle to make a comeback.  The movie is not a downer at all, in spite of the polio.  It's triumphant, moving, touching, and sweet.  And the music selections are some of the most popular of the opera repertoire.

Don't miss it.",1161475200,10,1507,4.423357664233577
571026,5,6303120504,"The very gifted actress Eleanor Parker, made simply a vibrant and extraordinarily vivid performance about the life of Marjorie Lawrence's personal tragedy who was attacked by the polio. The famous Farrell supports Parker in his several characterizations. Excel tribute to one of the most distinguished figures of the Bel Canto.

There are winning performances but the jewel of the crown was possibly his Brunhilde playing.

Watch to Roger Moore (27) as his brother.

571027,4,6303120504,"when I was 12 years old, but of course I didn't have my hat on backwards and I am not a boy.  I saw it with my best-friend, then and now, who was also a victim of polio.
This film was very touching and memorable.  The acting was great.  The music is beautiful.  The real-life drama of overcoming catastrophic personal crisis with courage and determination was touching to watch. It was particularly  significant to view with an individual who, while not famous, had to face the overwhelming uphill battle of dealing with the unfortunate personal tragedy of learning to live with the reality of infantile paralysis.
The beauty of this film and the feelings it evoked have stayed with me all these years and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  Certainly they don't make films like this today because not many 12 year-old boys or girls would attend.  Thank goodness it is available on video to those of us who still recognize good cinema.",1027728000,11,950,4.619047619047619
571028,4,6303120504,"I was 14 when this movie opened and I saw it at  least five times (but I have never in my life worn a baseball cap backward, so I guess I have not really contradicted the previous reviewer). I repeated because the  Liebestod (as sung by Eileen Farrell, though I did not know that until much  later) was one of the greatest musical  experiences of my life--then and  since, though I  had been a devout opera fan before that movie and have  been a serious Wagnerian ever since.  The  movie somewhat romanticized  Marjorie Lawrence's life, but Eleanor Parker and Glenn Ford, who played her  husband, built a credible dramatic picture of the calamity of serious  physical  illness striking a great artist.  Lawrence did sing Isolde at the  Met as her last performance there--whether she rose to fall across  Tristan's body must be for some other historian to tell--I certainly wasn't  there.  But the movie  inspires both admiration and creative enthusiasm in  anyone who can respond at all to great music and the great determination it  requires to perform it well.",957484800,31,1062,4.788888888888889

However, the story, the magnificent acting by Eleanor Parker,  (and acceptable acting by Glen Ford, although I wouldn't have given him star billing over Parker who owned the film), made this a worth while investment to watch over and over.  The tour de force by Parker and the tour de force signing by the then up and coming great Eileen Farrell, made my weekend complete.

Ether way, this movie was a life-changer for me, career-wise. The late Eleanor Parker gave a tour de force performance in this film. Glenn Ford also acted quite well. Now, thirty years later, I ordered one of the Warner Archive DVD's. As others have said, it's not a digitally remastered film, but color quality, sound, and picture are all very good. As to story, it still moved me, hokey as it is, and with the anachronistic opera 'acting' and vocal 'sobs' of the era, being more pronounced than I remember. Nevertheless, Having been in the Opera/Academic Music biz for half a century, singing with greats, and hearing Eileen Farrell's voice dubbed for Ms. Parker (and Ms. Lawrence) I NOW know why the film was so good- with Parker's looks and Farrell's pipes, how could you lose? I would give this film to any aspiring diva with a dramatic streak, or anyone who likes classical music and a triumph over adversity story line.

It stars Eleanor Parker and Glenn Ford in the true story
of Austrailian opera star Marjorie Lawrence,who overcame a dirt-poor childhood and
made a memorable comeback after being stricken with polio in the prime of her career. The movie has MGM's usual gorgeous Technicolor production and a great soundtrack featuring favorite arias and popular songs,all splendidly performed by Eileen Farrell,who dubbed Parker's vocals(her ""Over The Rainbow"" is marvelous!)The musical numbers are beautifully staged. The movie also benefits from strong Curtis Bernhart direction and a solid,well-written William Ludwig-Sonya Levien script. But the movie's best feature is its cast. Glenn Ford is excellent as Lawrence's devoted doctor husband,and Eleanor Parker gives the performance of her life as Marjorie.
They are well-backed by a brilliant supporting cast,including Cecil Kellaway and a very young Roger Moore.

571343,4,6303120504,"Eleanor Parker's Oscar-nominated performance is the main reason to witness INTERRUPTED MELODY, the true story of Australian opera singer Marjorie Lawrence, who was felled by polio at the height of her international career. Parker gives one of her stellar turns as Lawrence (helped by the accomplished dubbing of opera singer Eileen Farrell); and her chemistry with leading man Glenn Ford is palpable.

We follow Marjorie Lawrence (Parker) from the outback Queensland farm where she was raised, to the glitter of the Paris opera stages; and finally into the arms of Dr. Thomas King (Ford), for whom she sacrifices the momentum of her career. But a necessary South American tour comes to a crashing, premature end when Lawrence collapses during a rehearsal, and is diagnosed with severe polio.

INTERRUPTED MELODY is a testmament to the artistry and bravery of Marjorie Lawrence, who in real life went on to continue her remarkable career despite the odds. Eleanor Parker's performance is outstanding. To her credit she does take on an (albeit slight) Australian accent, and her dedication to the opera scenes really shows on screen (according to reports, Parker sang along to Eileen Farrell's musical tracks so that her throat would visibly flex and operate just as a regular singer's would). INTERRUPTED MELODY features beautifully-staged excerpts from many operas, including ""Il Trovatore"", ""Madama Butterfly"", ""La Boheme"", and ""Carmen"".

571346,5,6303120504,"This is a great MGM movie which may have limited appeal if you are not an opera lover.  But I am!  What a great movie - even if it is factually inaccurate about Marjorie Lawrence's life - the basics are all there.  And what a great cast!  The voice of Eileen Farrell to begin with (she even makes an uncredited appearance as the singer who can't get that high note in ""Visi D'Arte"" in the Paris singing lesson scene).  Most people nowadays remember Eleanor Parker from THE SOUND OF MUSIC as that preditory Baroness who nearly snatched the Captain away from Julie Andrews - but here she proves what a fine actress she is - as well as excellent lip-synching in the operatic and song segments.  Glenn Ford is a good romantic interest.  A treat is to have Roger Moore playing her brother Cyril - you'll love the sequence in Monte Carlo when she is on stage singing the trio in IL TROVATORE and sees him in the wings having arrived from Australia.

Polio was a disease that affected millions and the tragic effect it had on many lives must have been devastating.  Here we see one person's struggle to overcome enormous difficulties with paralysis. Have a look at the movie ""Sister Kenny""  (1946) with Rosalind Russell.  To perform on the operatic stage at The Metroplitan Opera in New York in the role of Isolde in Richard Wagner's TRISTAN UND ISOLDE in a full body brace must have taken wonderful courage.  She sang for the troops in World War Two from her wheelchair - how amazing to have Harold Arlen's ""Over The Rainbow"" in the movie in a very touching scene in the military hospital.

The opera scenes are all well staged and evoke the period and performance styles of the day. Pity that they have changed so much.  Was there ever a more beautiful Delilah as Eleanor Parker? And the wonderful moment where she mounts the horse and charges into the flames onstage in Wagner's GOTTERDAMMERUNG is just sensational.

I recommed this movie.

I know that many people often say this - but - ""They don't make 'em like this anymore!"" - and that's a great compliment indeed.",1292112000,5,2064,4.5528455284552845

7838960,5,6303120504,"A quality film, highly regarded at the time, Eleanor Parker received a Best Actress Oscar nomination.  Cinemascope (NOT 1.77 as listed on Amazon) and stereo sound.
