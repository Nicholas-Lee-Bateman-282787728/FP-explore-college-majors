3058755,3,B001138WWS,"This C Grade budget movie appears inspired by the 1958 Sinbad Movie with its low budget sci-fi graphics bringing to life an army of skeletons. (Obviously Pirates of the Caribbean comes to mind) On the modern day Baja peninsula, young adventurous dune racing enthusiasts have an innocent encounter with Coronado's 1590 conquistador army of skeletons; guarding their lost gold",1207440000,3,374,5.3559322033898304
3058756,5,B001138WWS,"This was a fun movie!  I love skeletons and especially  Ray Harryhausen.  This film gives you a ton of great skeletons and a good story to boot.  It is not a Holywood blockbuster but it is well worth the money and time to watch.  If you want a good story, great skeleton effects in a cool new format, and action this is the movie for you!!",1204675200,12,339,4.075757575757576

8240032,2,B001138WWS,"In 1590 Spanish conquistadors using LED lamps discover a cave filled with gold, only to be killed by the malnourished dead. Centuries later John Barnes (Ross Kelly) is celebrating his birthday by driving a VW buggy in the desert and sleeping in a tent, kicking out his former girlfriend (Audrey Anderson) who I thought was hotter than his wife (Stefani Marchesi with a zit). Needless to say someone in the group arouses the underfed third world dead and they never think about running the bones over with their vehicles. The gold and boulders seemed Hollywood light. I really couldn't imagine that girl lifting that huge rock over her head that easily.

The film was low budget and SyFy quality with badly written characters who were uninteresting.

Guide: No sex or nudity. Brief language, some blood splatter. 1 1/2 STARS",1453161600,,823,4.913669064748201
8240033,4,B001138WWS,"I recently bought a 10-movie Maverick Entertainment collection called Dark Disposition for $5 from Walmart.  I have watched the first two movies so far and I feel I have already gotten more than my money's worth.  Army  of the Dead is the second film.  Decent, enjoyable.

The first film, 13 Hours in a Warehouse, is actually like a well-done Japanese horror flick.  More true scares, not that much blood and guts.  I have yet to watch the other eight, but if they are half as good as these first two movies it's well worth the price.",1447977600,,534,4.5
8240034,1,B001138WWS,I ordered this for my husband who loves B movies by mistake.  We'd both rate this one an F!  It was really bad.,1356912000,,111,3.782608695652174
8240035,3,B001138WWS,"""Army of the Dead"" is not a gory violent movie, like most horror movies today. It does have it's charm but is a watered down version of ""Army of Darkness"". This is probably a attempt to make ""Army of Darkness"" with a modern twist. I still think ""Army of Darkness"" is way better and the effects are almost the same. This is your typical B-horror movie without the gore. I would watch this movie again and it holds down an interesting concept. The skeleton army is pretty cool for a low budget film. I didn't mind the bad acting, because all B-movies have bad acting. If you have kids who are in there early teens this is a great movie for you. There is no nudity, I can't recall any profanity, and there is little to no gore. So if you like horror movies that you can watch with your teenage kids this is a rare movie for you. I thought it was an ok movie that is rare in the horror genre. If you are a gore fan stay away you will find this movie cheesy and boring. This is something you would find on the sci-fi channel.",1298073600,,1020,4.130653266331659
8240036,3,B001138WWS,"It is a good fun movie, that even children would like! Good plot, acting also descent, and the effects are pretty good.

8240037,5,B001138WWS,"The people that reviewed this movie and said it was ""good"" either appreciate  really, really, really, really bad movies, or they have very low standards.  I would highly recommend this movie IF you want to watch something so terrible that it borders on greatness!  The Rock is more convincing as an actor than anybody in this cast of whose-nots; the special effects would have been special twenty years ago - now, they only add to the ridiculousness of the movie.  The story itself was so ill-conceived that it makes the American Pie movies seem like the Godfather by comparison.  But, if you appreciate total crap, this is worth the few dollars you'll have to spend on it!",1232841600,,673,4.717948717948718
8240038,2,B001138WWS,"A group of people go out to the desert to celebrate someone dorks birthday by desert racing, only the professor of the group has a double intention to find some lost gold in which he does find and releases a curse that anyone who steal the gold, or knows where the gold is hidden is hunted down by an army of skeletons.

If you can't resist watching this, don't expect to see any decent acting or a much of a plot. For a low budget movies the cgi they used is not that bad considering, but the blood will make you roll on the ground laughing.

You won't kick yourself for missing this film in your life, the cover is much more appealing then the movie itself.",1228867200,,659,4.181102362204724
8240039,3,B001138WWS,"This is not a real bad movie, I'll keep it on hand along with my B collection. All in All 3 stars is good enough for this one.",1215475200,,126,3.5357142857142856
8240040,1,B001138WWS,"This was really, really awful - bad script, acting, and the effects were definitely sub-par. I can deal with cheese, but this was just one of those movies that make you wonder how it got financed, completed, and released. Most movies that the Sci Fi Channel does are better than this and that's saying a great deal. The story line had potential, but everything else just causes it to flat line.

Movies of this type that were done better? Army of Darkness (plenty of cheesy fun) or any of the Mummy movies. Other reviewers seem to like it which makes me wonder if they were involved with the film somehow. See for yourself, but don't say you weren't warned!",1211846400,,657,4.5210084033613445
8240041,5,B001138WWS,"The movie starts off a little slow as you're getting to know the characters, but about a quarter into it you're on the edge of your seat and stay there until the very end.  It was non-stop action.  Even the special effects were really good.  For a ""B"" movie the acting was fantastic.  The characters were very believable.  Ross Kelly and Stephanie Marchese were awesome. Both are deinitely ""A"" actors.  I'd like to see a sequel, if it's as well written as this one was.",1208044800,4,469,4.458823529411765
