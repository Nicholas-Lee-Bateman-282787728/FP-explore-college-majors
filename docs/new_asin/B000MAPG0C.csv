2727820,3,B000MAPG0C,"I love Sugarland and this DvD gives a great insight into the group. Lacking in musical ear candy. If you want to hear their songs in conjunction with eye candy, this is not for you. If you would like a great video insight into the group, this DvD is fantastic. It was not clear from the description that this was more of a documentary then a music video. NOT a music video, but a very insightlful documentary. Well worth the purchase depending on your expectations.",1272240000,8,465,4.482352941176471

8167535,5,B000MAPG0C,"If you are a lover of Sugarland this is a must to own. The one on one interviews with Jennifer & Kristian are memorable. Seeing the two behind the scenes is what I cherish the most as it shows they might be country music superstars, they are also human with lives off the stage. The making of there music is beautifully told. This is your chance to own a piece of the history of what is Sugarland !!!",1433548800,,400,4.141025641025641
