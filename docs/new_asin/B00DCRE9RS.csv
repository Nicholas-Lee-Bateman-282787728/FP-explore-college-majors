8591949,4,B00DCRE9RS,A quirky movie that's a fun way to kill a couple hours.,1474675200,,55,3.6666666666666665
8591950,3,B00DCRE9RS,"I am not entirely sure what this movie was supposed to be. Spoiled rich kid graduates college where he slacked off the whole time. Mommy and Daddy cut him off, give him 5000 dollars and he goes to Italy with it and gets robbed and things happen. Nothing we haven't seen before and done better. I wanted to like this but it never happened. Was it a comedy? Was it a rom-com? was it an adventure? I think it tried for all of them and just fell short on each. The lead Bobby Kennedy, is likable but that is it. This movie never grabbed me fully or had my attention all the way through.",1434931200,,582,4.114035087719298
8591951,4,B00DCRE9RS,"Mostly it was curiosity about Bobby Kennedy III. I hadn't even heard he existed, and I'm happy to report he has the just right kind of personable and good-hearted, if just a tad quirky, screen presence to assure we will be seeing more of him. Fortunately, he's not just leveraging the name of a family that has long made the entertainment industry its second interest after public service. Starting with Movie Mogul/Ambassador Joe I, Bobby III makes four generations of politics or show biz, but only rarely, both.  The gene pool appears to provide all the natural gifts to nicely meet the challenges of holding a screwball comedy together--not all that different from running a political campaign, come to think of it--and if the easy charm with his lovely  co-star, Susan Sarandon's daughter Eva Amurri, might stray precariously close to goofy, it never appears forced.

Keep in mind nobody pretends this is anything more ambitious than a featherweight RonCom/Coming-of-Age flick. Yet the script is sufficiently witty and amusing to secure cameos from the likes of Alec Baldwin and the iconic Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini. (Stars, you know, have ""people"" to actually read the entire screenplay to assure their clients never embarrass themselves because in a moment of weakness they lent their names as a favor to help a promising--uh, and/or well-connected--young filmmaker find financing.) Sure, some of the bits might be clichs or stereotypical, but if you've ever been young and strapped while kicking around Europe, and especially if you've survived absent your passport along with all your cash and plastic, then you'll smile in recognition at this character's misadventures, and like me, would happily buy him a drink or even lunch if you bumped into him in your travels today.

First class cinematography makes the most of terrific Italian locations. Obviously begging favors every inch of the way, Eurotrapped not only cleverly maximizes a shoestring budget to look like a much more expensive movie, but succeeds head and shoulders above the usual debut feature. Even better, it's fun to watch. Nice work, everybody!",1383350400,2,2130,5.183139534883721
