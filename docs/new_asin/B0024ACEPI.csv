3845433,5,B0024ACEPI,"I love Dinner: Impossible and I think Robert Irvine does a great job and is a great chef. In this season he has several food challenges that he must complete in a given time. These challenges can be very difficult and require skill. It is definitely on of my favorite tv shows and I would recommend purchasing this season. This is, however, the only season you can purchase in disc form that I know of. I wish food network would release the others seasons. If you just want a good show that will get you biting your nails then you will love Dinner: Impossible.",1348876800,,560,4.394230769230769
3845434,5,B0024ACEPI,"in the product description it says there is one disc but three are describes
obviously the listing of 1 dvd is wrong

one episode has the name weeding impossible, but I would guess it is supposed to be wedding impossible which fits the description

also the word 'with' should be 'will' in the first line of the description.

that said, the show is a very interesting race to finish dozens of dishes in 6 hours with changes made on the fly if something is missing or ruined.  Anyone interested in competition cooking should like this season dvd.",1341100800,,545,4.587628865979381
3845435,4,B0024ACEPI,"It's amazing what a TALENTED man could do with a shoestring budget, limited time and obsticals. I bet he could even make Dog Food taste GOOD!! (And most of us had eaten Dog Food before) Skilled and Respectful!!!",1339718400,,211,4.578947368421052
3845436,5,B0024ACEPI,I like to see the challenges that Robert has. Great entertainment! Highly recommended. I just wish they would come out with them a little quicker.,1334966400,,146,4.88
3845437,5,B0024ACEPI,Robert Irvine is a great host and his shows are very inspiring. He is really passionate without being in your face or too much ego. His other show Restaurant Impossible is really good as well. Give it a try.,1310860800,7,207,4.333333333333333
3845438,5,B0024ACEPI,"Does this movie have close captions? I have brought some movies through online that didn't have close captions (English). Please let me know If this movie include close captions as well.

Thanks.

3845439,5,B0024ACEPI,"I have watched this DVD several times already.  It's really fun especially to see how Chef Irvine first started out with Dinner Impossible.  I look forward to other seasons being released soon because the ""missions"" get more challenging - and also more hilarious.",1270425600,16,263,5.093023255813954
3845440,4,B0024ACEPI,"Dinner Impossible was Robert Irvine's first series and it predates Restaurant Impossible. It doesn't have the same interesting thrill that RI has. He is basically just competing against a contrived set of circumstances and ""winning"" by making a decent meal under horrendous conditions. It is fun and worth watching, but if you are expecting it to be as good as RI you will be disappointed.",1400803200,,389,5.0
3845441,5,B0024ACEPI,"I purchased this for my folks who are in their early 80's. They loved it.... and wanted the second season, which of course, was never produced. In each segment the Chef is put into a different kind of challenge, such as cooking and serving a meal on a train. How he is able to pull it off, even though things go haywire, is amazing and just good entertainment.",1395360000,,360,4.3088235294117645
3845442,4,B0024ACEPI,Item as described! Its great to add this to my DI collection now if only I could get the other seasons i'm missing 2-7,1394150400,,118,3.9583333333333335

3845444,5,B0024ACEPI,"Entertaining, interesting, fun.  These are about people, cooking, and food.  They are amazing in execution and lots of fun to watch.  Robert Irving is a good guy with a great heart and wide experience and lots of talent.",1385596800,,220,4.7368421052631575

3845448,5,B0024ACEPI,"We really enjoyed this DVD and pull it out from time to time and watch it again, Irvine is eminently watchable and knowledgeable and the missions are diverse and challenging. Just good clean fun that never gets old at our house. We are waiting for subsequent seasons to be available cannot understand why this takes so long from Food Network, would love to see Iron Chef made available too, there are some things we can watch over and over and enjoy with our family and friends and most of the Food Network DVDs are included in that collection.",1352505600,2,544,4.561224489795919

8350377,2,B0024ACEPI,"I was not aware that the a ""complete"" first season could have truncated shows, but it seems that I am not the only person awaiting the release of the actual episodes aired on food network.  The shorter versions are not at all as entertaining as the full length version of the show, I will be attempting to return this product as soon as possible while attempting to find full length versions.",1406332800,4,392,4.52112676056338

8350380,5,B0024ACEPI,"I like this guy and really dig not just this series but Restaurant impossible as well though Dinner Impossible is better IMO.
 I received  this three days ago and have been watching it off and on,( Only the first season of DI is available for purchase so I have to savor the episodes slowly). :)
 This guy is really cunning and resilient in his challenges and though I wouldn't want to work for him ( My last restaurant job I was a teenager and already had my fill of kitchens) , I would sincerely like to eat at one of his restaurants . Im not a gourmet , im a glutton :)

I know hes not an OFFICIAL Iron Chef but as far as im concerned he is and thats the title I would use to address him should we ever meet.
 Now then , lets get the other seasons of DI up for sale already !",1402704000,,778,3.929936305732484
