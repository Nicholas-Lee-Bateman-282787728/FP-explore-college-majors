8099081,3,B000CIT74A,"This is not a traditional floor ab routine with just crunches; I liked how there was a lot of variety of different moves.  However, I was dissapointed that many of the non-Floor exercises just didn't target the abs much, so my abs didn't feel sore during or after the workout.  Also, I'm concerned that many of the movements are high risk for injury.

The instructor is motivating, does the motions with good form, and gives good cueing about what motion to do next.  However, she doesn't give enough reminders about posture and keeping your abs tucked in.  The music, set, and video quality is good.

It's annoying that this DVD doesn't allow you to forward to specific chapters/sections (e.g. skip the Intro/Welcome chatter & Warmup segment)

summary of moves...

~10min WARM UP:
Light standing cardio workout moves. (which begninners may find mildly challenging, but will be easy for advanced).
There are lots of fast lunges, knee lifts, and body twists that might not be suitable for beginners because it's hard on the knees and back.
Except for a few exercises, most of the motions don't isolate/target the abs specifically.

~10min TRANSFIRMER(on a step/stool):
Back leg lifts alternating with too many hamstring stretches
Lean sideways while sitting on step
Oblique twists with alternate leg
Reverse crunches while sitting on the step
