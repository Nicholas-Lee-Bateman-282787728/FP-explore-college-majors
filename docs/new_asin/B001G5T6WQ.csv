8303928,5,B001G5T6WQ,"I bought this collection for the sole purpose of obtaining a copy of the film ""Derzu Uzala"" (which, by the way, is a man's name). It is a dramatic, touching, and thoroughly engaging account of Russian engineers tasked with surveying and documenting, for the first time, the spectacular and vast Russian wilderness at the beginning of the Soviet era, so that the resources could be extracted and used for rapid industrialization. More moving than I can possibly describe.",1494633600,5,470,5.038461538461538

8303931,4,B001G5T6WQ,"I bought this set solely for Derzu Uzala a Kurosowa film that I've loved for years. The handsome hero does not always win or get the girl in this set. Sometimes things get messy; just like in real life. These are gritty films for adults to watch, enjoy.",1358380800,8,253,4.291666666666667
