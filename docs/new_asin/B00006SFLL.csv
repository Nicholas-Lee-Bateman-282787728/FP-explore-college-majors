1793217,5,B00006SFLL,"I recommend this to anyone. Young or old, this is something anyone could be pleased with. Inu-Yasha is my only favorite anime cartoon to watch, sorry no other cartoon really gets me, other than Inu-Yasha. A suggestion I have is that you should watch it from the beginning so that you will have knowledge of who is who. Watch the movie first though, Its called Inu-Yasha Affections Touching Across Time DVD, this will tell you a bit about every character and if you go to extras(note its ALL in japenese) but yes there are subtiles,(Another movie is soming out, its the second part, not to ruin the movie but theres a part where Kagome gets shot with an arrow, that's all i remember.) you will get to see almost all the epsodies made, from how Inu-yasha meets Kagome, to how he even breaks his fathers sword the Teasiga*spell check?*. THIS IS A MUST BUY!",1039305600,2,853,4.545454545454546
1793218,5,B00006SFLL,"""Inu-Yasha"" is one of Rumiko Takahashi's biggest properties, and American publisher Viz knows that. After publishing 12 volumes and counting of the manga, they were determined bring the anime series to America and give it as much exposure as it deserved. So they approached Cartoon Network and managed to get the property onto the network's highly rated Adult Swim block, and the series just took off from there. Now the series is being released monthly on DVD, and like the first DVD, the second DVD, ""A Girl's Best Friend"", is a solid release.
With the Shikon no Tama shattered, Kagome and Inu-Yasha must team up together so they may search for the possibly hundreds of fragments. But the cocky half-demon, unable to even call Kagome by her own name, refuses to even consider the idea. But when a hair-controlling oni called Yura arrives and steals the single shard Kagome has in her possession, the middle-school student and her reluctant companion must put aside their differences and face the demon together. Then, when an old acquaintance of Inu-Yasha's, Myoga the flea-demon, enters the picture, he reveals that someone is attempting to rob Inu-Yasha's father's grave. Inu-Yasha soon discovers that that ""someone"" is his own elder, full-demon brother Sesshoumaru, who plans to use any despicable means possible in order to find a priceless treasure within his father's grave.
While the true essence of ""Inu-Yasha"" isn't found until later in the plot, these episodes do well to flesh out the story marvelously. The plot makes a quick jump from the first story arc to the next, deciding not to weigh the story down with unnecessary exposition or backstory. And each story moves along at a perfect pace, bringing Takahashi's already excellent manga to life. Granted, the anime does tone down the manga's violence and nudity somewhat (ex: Sesshoumaru breaks a man's neck instead of rips his head off), but that's merely a minor gripe.
Visually, ""Inu-Yasha"" continues to amaze with its beautiful art direction. The series is definately one of the best looking animes on the market, comparable to series such as ""Cowboy Bebop"" and the movie ""Metropolis"". Character models are perfect renditions of their manga counterparts, and scenery is vivid and detailed. A lot of work went into this series, and it undoubtedly shows.
Audio-wise, Wada Kaoru creates a beauatiful tapestry of sounds that fit the nature of the series perfectly. With orchestral melodies and downbeats, emotional tension is brought to its full potential, complimenting the visuals wonderfully. In regards to the opening and ending, the opening doesn't fit the series that well but the ending ends each episode on a haunting and perfect note.
As for the English dub, it's really starting to grow away from the ""average feel"" it established with the initial set of episodes, although it still has a way to go. Richard Cox by now has firmly established himself as Inu-Yasha; he may not sound as powerful as the original Japanese voice actor, but Cox is possibly the closest an English-speaking Inu-Yasha can get. Monica Stori has improved as Kagome in this set of episodes, but she hasn't yet reached the level established by Cox's performance. Paul Dobsen, while he doesn't sound like an old man, manages to voice the tiny flea-demon Myoga marvelously. David Kaye is a perfect fit for Inu-Yasha's condescending brother Sesshoumaru, and Don Brown voices Sesshoumaru's lowly assistent Jaken wonderfully.
Overall, the dub cast is a stellar one, but there's still one thing hindering the overall quality of the dub: the script. Unfortunately, the script still uses cliches, catchphrases, and puns throughout the show; episode four is actually a good example of how not to Americanize a Japanese anime series. Even so, the script is improving quite a bit, the biggest improvement no doubt being the allowance of curse words. It was widely thought that Viz would eliminate curse words from the ""Inu-Yasha"" dub altogether, but episode six thankfully proved this idea false. In all, the English dub as taken a step in the right direction and will only get better from here.
Overall, ""A Girl's Best Friend"" is another worthy DVD from Viz. Many will complain about Viz's decision to put only three episodes on each disc, but people must be aware of two things: 1)Viz has stated that the series will either be released three episodes per disc monthly or four episodes per disc every two months, and they decided to go with the slightly more expensive yet faster method; and 2) the Japanese ""Inu-Yasha"" DVDs also have three episodes per disc yet cost almost twice as much. If that explanation doesn't work for you, then you can always wait for a boxed set. But for those who cannot wait for a boxed set, then this DVD, along with the first one, should be more than enough.",1039132800,62,4826,4.988833746898263
1793219,5,B00006SFLL,"I only started watching Inu Yasha a few months ago, but I have found it to be one of the best anime series I have ever watched. I really really recomend this series to anyone who has ever liked anime. It is basicaly an action-packed love story. You get attatched to all of the charecters throughout their adventures through feudal Japan. Unlike some anime whose sole purpose is to teach morals, Inu Yasha's storyline is very intricate. The show is full of very detailed villans and youkai. Unfortunaely, the English dubbed version is not quite as good as the origanal. This is mainly because of the voice acters and little edits here and there. Overall though, the English version is great. I love the acter they have playing Inu Yasha. The cuts are not all that bad either. Yes, even though I am a girl, I do still like every little gory part. Well anyways, I absolutely love this anime, and I am sure that anyone else would love it too.",1035763200,,938,4.491228070175438
1793266,5,B00006SFLL,"When we last saw our heroes Kagome, after having her shard of the Shikon Jewel stolen by the crafty Yura of the Demon Hair, is magically transported back to her own time. Thrilled to be home, she is quick to forget the quest she knows she and Inuyasha must complete. Meanwhile half-demon Inuyasha and Kaede are still back in the Feudal Era and with Yura running around, it looks like they don't have much time left. This episode picks up where the last left off. Yura, who has the ability to weave a dangerous web of hair that is invisible to all but Kagome and Kaede, attacks Inuyasha and everyone at the village. Kaede is left mortally wounded and Inuyasha is the only one left who can go through the well and get Kagome back. Will they be able to defeat Yura in time? The second two episodes introduce Sesshomaru, Inuyasha's older brother who also happens to be a full demon. He despises Inuyasha for what he is but more than anything he wants the Tetsusaiga, a powerful sword forged from a fang of their father's. Unfortunately for Inuyasha the only way Sesshomaru can get the Tetsusaiga is by using Inuyasha. And he does this by what looks like bringing Inuyasha's human mother back from the dead and harming her until Inuyasha breaks down. But of course, things aren't as they seem and if Inuyasha doesn't figure out Sesshomaru's evil plot soon, he and Kagome are done for.
Just like the first DVD, A Girl's Best Friend has three very engrossing episodes of Inuyasha, ""Yura of the Demon Hair,"" ""Aristocratic Assassin, Sesshomaru,"" and ""Tetsusaiga, the Phantom Sword."" Also, just like the first DVD. This one ends in a hell of a cliffhanger. The new characters that are introduced are quite fascinating. Of course there's Sesshomaru, a demon worshiped by fans everywhere (especially female friends). He is a perfect villain, a coldhearted assassin who is as ruthless as he is powerful. How can Inuyasha face someone so much more powerful than he? Another new character (whom I introduce with a lot less enthusiasm) is Jaken, Sesshomaru's servant whose only purpose seems to be getting in the way. Still he makes the otherwise serious scenes with Sesshomaru a little more lighthearted so I guess he's not completely worthless. Another new character is Inuyasha's servant, Myoga who is always good for a laugh.
Once again you can watch every episode subbed and dubbed and they're all a complete joy to watch. If you love Inuyasha, buy this DVD. I can't wait to see the next DVD in the series, Fathers and Sons.",1056844800,4,2513,4.7266514806378135

Sessoneru:He is one of my all time favorite villians(Vicious:Cowboy Bebop)(Knives:Trigun)(Sephroth:Final Fantasy VII)(I know there's a villian more crutial than him) But I just like his style, laid back, hardly suprised cold dark hearted, and evil.

This really got the show underway, as action, and character evolution.  If you loved the first volume, there's no doubt in my mind, you'll love this.",1053302400,,1501,4.622641509433962

1793270,5,B00006SFLL,"Aww...  I LOVE Inuyasha!!!  It was on Cartoon Network Saturday nights @10 Central, but then it was moved to Mon-Thurs 11 Central!!  I can't watch it at 11!!  On a Weeknight!!X/
  AH-HA-HEM.  Sorry.
  Now...  You will LOVE Inuyasha, I guarantee...  I read a manga once, thought it was okay, heard the hype, read another, loved it, started catchin' the Anime, now I'm HOOKED!
  I told a friend (who's a bit of an otaku) about Inuyasha, begged her too read one of mine (I like having partners in crime! ^_^) and she said no, it didn't look like something she'd like...  BUT- Little did she know that INUYASHA IS FOR EVERYONE!!!  There's a little bit of everything.  SO one day, I was busy and she picked up my Inuyasha manga...  And whaddya know...  She loved it!  (Same thing happened with Lord of the Rings! XD  Legolas...  Orlando Bloom...  Ahh... <3)
  Inuyasha is about a girl who is transported to Feudal Japan from Modern Tokyo, where she meets Inuyasha, a half-breed dog Demon.  There's this big scandal, with Kagome (the girl) being the previous incarnation of Kikyo, the priestess who supposedly killed Inuyasha, betraying him when he and Kikyo were supposedly in love.  This, obviously, creates some odd situations for Kagome. XD  However, eventually, despite Inuyasha's stubbornness, eventually, he and Kagome fall in love.  Aww...
  Full of action, comedy and romance, Inuyasha is the Anime for Everyone!!!  Don't be too worried about the whole demon/priestess type thing...  I'm not Shinto either, and I don't think demons are as portrayed (I'm a Christian...  Demons freak me, man...) but it's not about demons; it's about action, comedy and romance! XD
  So, you'll love it...  [Really!]  I like book vol. 9, myself...  However, if you're getting DVD or VHS, look for the episode ""Kagome's Voice and Kikyo's Kiss""; Super-cool romance action!  I missed that episode, but I read it!  (Not in vol. 9- don't let that confoozle you ^_^)  It's not out on DVD/VHS at this point though, so you'll have to be patient. >_<
P.S. I wish I was Kagome 'cuz she gets Inuyasha...  And Inuyasha is so cute!",1043193600,4,2102,4.805633802816901
1793271,3,B00006SFLL,"Lets get this one started now shall we. Let start off by saying this is one of my favorite anime. But the DVD is not so hot. It only contains 3 episodes per disk this one has 4-7, only 3 episodes and for the price.... The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because 1. It is a great series, 2. The picture is fair, and 3. the sound is fair. But the sound and picture look better on the DVD than they do on the show. So don't get this DVD and wait untill Viz releases the COMPLETE first season of Inuyasha.",1042934400,,509,3.857142857142857
1793272,5,B00006SFLL,"If you thought Inu-Yasha Down the Well was good,you will be amazed with the performance of this one. This DVD contains episodes 4-6 which is the sesshoumaru sega.(The DVD after this one is called A True Warrior Never puts a Woman before a Battle.)That DVD also introduces Shippo,but I won't review any more than that. Anybody who is thinking about buying Love Hina should check this out in addition to it.
  Also the show Inu-Yasha comes on cartoonnetwork's Adult Swim at 11:00 and 11:30 on Saturdays. Starting January 13th mon.-thur. it comes on at 12:30.

7973151,5,B00006SFLL,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

In this volume we are introduced to Inuyasha's brother, Sesshomaru. He is a full demon and hates his brother intensely. He is also searching for their father's sword. The search leads him to Inuyasha and Kagome. A fierce battle takes place and Lives are nearly lost.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable.

7973152,4,B00006SFLL,"There's nothing like adversity to bring a bickering pair of protagonists together, and there's plenty of THAT coming along in the second volume of Rumiko Takahashi historical fantasy, ""Inuyasha: A Girl's Best Friend."" While the anti-hero and flaky heroine still get along like cats and dog-boys, the adventure-packed story, lush animation and enticingly elaborate bad guys make it fascinating.

Inuyasha storms into Kagome's home in the middle of dinner, intent on dragging her back through the well (""Idiot! Who told you you could go home?!""). Unfortunately he's attracted the attention of Yura and her killer hair (no really, it kills you) -- and when he and Kagome venture back into the warring states era, they find Yura waiting for Inuyasha and his head of pretty silver hair. But while Kagome has rotten aim and no other powers, she may be able to stop Yura's reign of hairy terror.

And Inuyasha has barely recovered from that little escapade when weird little flea demon (no, really!) Myoga arrives to tell him that his father's tomb has been broken into. And the exact details become more obvious when Inuyasha's older brother Sesshomaru appears, along with a skyscraper-sized ogre and Inuyasha's long-dead mother. He wants the location of their father's tomb, and is convinced that Inuyasha knows where it is.

When Inuyasha rushes to rescue his beloved human mother, he and Kagome are sucked into a idyllic, deadly world where a strange demon is planning a fate worse than death for him. But the perils don't end when Sesshomaru finds the way to the tomb -- the odd couple follow him into a vast realm of the dead, where a very strange family heirloom is waiting for them.

Magical swords, an otherworldly realm filled with demon skeletons, beheaded bodies, a faceless woman who literally sucks people into her body, a flea in a teeny-tiny kimono, and a giant hairball full of razor hair. ""Inuyasha - A Girl's Best Friend"" takes your average quest fantasy, adds a cornucopia of Japanese mythological elements, and mixes in a little hint of romantic comedy as well.

But it becomes even more evident that this is a darker piece of work than its predecessors ""Ranma 1/2"" and ""Maison Ikkoku"" -- there's plenty of gory action (Inuyasha gets stabbed, beaten up or drowned at least once an episode) and a trail of dead bodies whenever a bad guy shows up. Fortunately since this is based on a Rumiko Takahashi manga, there's also lots of comedy (the whole ""Take your clothes off!"" scene, or Kagome almost killing Myoga with bug spray), and a hint of potential romance... far, far in the future.

Our intrepid heroine Kagome is still something of a flake who doesn't seem to quite understand some of the peril she's in (""You do realize Sesshomaru's in there?"" ""WELL DUH!""), but she does seem to be smartening up. And the grumpy anti-hero Inuyasha is fleshed out considerably here -- without being melodramatic, the writers explore his troubled past as a half-demon half-human boy, and his mingled feelings about his fractured family. Oh yeah, and we encounter Sesshomaru -- an icy Sephiroth-like demon who seems to have no qualms about abusing everyone around him (including his nasty little toady servant).

""Inuyasha Volume 2 - A Girl's Best Friend"" smooths out some of the initial wrinkles of the series, and introduces an interesting new villain. And it only gets better after this.",1252540800,,3389,4.924693520140105

7973154,4,B00006SFLL,"The first episdoe of this volume concerns the continuing battle with Yura of the Hair, a witch who is able to puppeteer corpses and use her hair to cut off body parts. Yes, she's always having a bad hair day! Sorry about that. In what I believe will be an ongoing trend, Inuyasha finds that he can't defeat Yura alone because only Kagome can see Yura's strands of hair. In the second story arc in this volume, a talking flea named Myoga, with the inappropriate title ""Divine Grace"" shows up to tell Inuyasha that someone is trying to rob his father's grave! That would-be graverobber is Sessho-Maru, Inuyasha's half-brother and full-blooded demon, which makes him more powerful than our anti-hero. Let's just say there's no love lost between the two, because there isn't any love at all! Looks like Inuyasha might have to call on Kagome again as the two square off.

Rumiko Takahashi is a true manga genius. Her artwork is beautiful and the anime is almost a direct copy of her manga series. You find yourself actually seeing an anime in your head when you read her manga, because they are so exquisitely detailed, and the characters spring to life. The Japanese voice actors are superb and really match the image of the manga characters. There is also a sort of warm charm in the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome that seems more real than even most shojo. I could do without the 6 minutes average that is wasted in each episode with opening titles and recap but that's a small complaint. Great show!",1121817600,2,1508,4.669172932330827

VizVideo has done a great job with production of this DVD including the Japanese dub with English subtitles, and watching it in English as well.  The English dubbing is excellent just like all the other Inu-Yasha episodes.  It's definately an improvement of what anime use to be like!  The DVD includes conceptual art from the series.

Out of all of the episodes in the series; 4,5 and 6 are not my favorite, but still great!  Inu-Yasha, taking place in the time of futile Japan carries on a grand adventure in search for the Jewel Shards.  As of now in the series, (A Girl's Best Friend DVD) the characters are down at minimum.  The main characters are still only Kogome and Inu-Yasha.  When the series progresses with more characters and twists, it gets a lot better.  Still, one cannot enjoy the series without seeing it all!  This is a great continuance to the first DVD, and is highly recommended for anime fans or those who just like long series with great characters and adventure.
Tips: Beware of bootlegs when buying DVDs, especially anime.  The official VizVideo DVD of Inu-Yasha: A Girl's Best Friend should include only episodes 4,5, & 6.
