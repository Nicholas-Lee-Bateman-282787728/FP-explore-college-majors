8717786,4,B00YASQWKU,"My favourite thing about Eurotrash opera productions - radically political and elaborately trendy remixes of 18th and 19th century works that began life with breastplates, horned helmets, well-fed singers and real-life trees on-stage - is the YouTube comments that accompany the trailers. One complained about the shear vulgarity of a new production (which I extravagantly praised) of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rameau-Les-Indes-Galantes/dp/B011A5GFLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rameau: Les Indes Galantes</a>. This new Tannhauser will surely bring its own tsunami of outrage, but then outrage is nothing new when it comes to a work Wagner wrote with controversy in mind.

The culture wars have always been with us, and Wagner trolled the comfortable bourgeoisie with the best of them. The bait was always taken, though the biggest splash at the 1861 Paris premiere came from the Jockey Club, who objected to the ballet occurring at the beginning of the opera, rather than after the interval when their members usually arrived. Baudelaire saw Wagners not-too-well-hidden meaning right away, saying barbarity always has to have its place in the drama of love, and sensual enjoyment has to lead, by a satanic logic, to the delights of crime. If the composer could see whats happening at his sacred Festspielhaus in the 21st century of course hed himself be shocked, but surely he would have been pleased by the strong response. This is, after all, an opera about sex.

I always like to go with the flow with these kind of spectacles. I tend to be open to experimental dramaturgy, and I like whats happening here in that regard. Sebastien Baumgartens production, which centres around Joep van Lieshouts imposing industrial installation, is focussed on Tannhauser as experiment. To go with this, though, musical standards must be high, and the singing especially needs to be strong. This production passes that bar easily, with outstanding singing and acting from Michelle Breedt as Venus, Camilla Nylund as Elisabeth, and especially Torsten Kerl as Tannhauser. Conductor Axel Kober provides more than capable support with the Bayreuth Festival Orchestra & Chorus, and the entire experience is communicated with excellent sound, video, lighting and camera work.

So bottom line: Im shocked just a bit, titillated just a bit, impressed a lot.

Salacious note: People buying this DVD without reading the comments (Caveat emptor!) might not realize what they're getting. Look at that cover above!  For the good stuff search out the YouTube trailer.",1447200000,,2589,5.544303797468355
8717787,3,B00YASQWKU,"I have to start by saying this is one of my favorite operas of Wagner. It is full of beautiful moments, none more beautiful than the Overture. The conducting and the musical interpretation are wonderful... I would have preferred listening to this performance. From the outset, the listener/watcher is distracted, not only by the industrial quality of the set of this romantic era piece, but there are so many needless distractions. At the beginning, one wonders, hmm, lungs, inhaling, exhaling, oh, is that TB? Perhaps lung cancer? Hands? spreading germs from one to another. Drinking... oh, lots of drinking. And these dancers, are they depicting sperm, tadpoles? Something to do with fertility. And VERY pregnant Venus, keeps grabbing onto her baby bump until we KNOW it could never be real. When she steals a big wink at the audience in her ""seduction"" of Tannhauser to stay behind, it is too Vaudeville to be Wagner. It seems all the work of a director that is suffering from mass quantities of ADHD, hyperactivity is not necessary. Every movement of strings is punctuated by movement of a person's hand, every down beat, someone stands or sits, it is all too predictable after a while. Having the audience on the stage, there is the moving floor, the singers getting up and down different levels, a bit much. My personal low point was the monk kneeling, singing, all with a cassock and a pink baseball hat. The singers were fine. Venus was lovely, Elizabeth reliable, and the lower men were great. Kerl was a labored and under pitched Tannhauser. I would be so disappointed to go to Bayreuth and see this post industrialist rubbish on the stage. Who needs 28,000 liters of Alcohol? Gratuitous waste of time, not much to do with Wagner.",1442275200,4,1740,4.842281879194631
8717788,4,B00YASQWKU,"Always controversial in their revisionist approach to Wagner's legacy, the 2014 Tannhuser is fairly typical of recent Bayreuth productions. Director Sebastian Baumgarten's idea is to bring together several art installation pieces by the artist and sculptor Joep van Lieshout. These pieces, with names like Alcoholator, Disciplinator and Technocrat, are processes that produce a 'biogas', the whole system forming a kind of working model for the cyclical human and bodily processes that generate life and, by extension, art. Which, even though they weren't created with Wagner in mind, is more or less what Tannhuser is about.

It's a little more complicated than that. There's the co-dependency of physical and the spiritual, but also an outlook on society as a whole, on the role of the artist, and of course it's all tied up in Wagner's own complex and contradictory impulses, political vision and developing philosophical outlook. Baumgarten's Tannhuser follows a similar path to Hans Neuenfels' laboratory experiment 'rat' Lohengrin for Bayreuth, viewing the work as a model of society, taking in Wagner's perspective and extending it to a more modern outlook. It's not so much trying to update it or make it fit as use it as a means to revisit the work and explore whether it really has something new to inform our view of the world we live in today.

I'm not sure that the director really manages to draw anything new out of Tannhuser, but it does encourage anyone who thinks they are familiar with the work to reconsider more deeply what it is about, and question whether those contradictions and inconsistencies within it aren't actually essential to its purpose. It does at least, I find, explore the characters in greater detail, and not just Tannhuser, but also Venus and Elisabeth and the relationships between them. Wolfram von Eschenbach also comes out of this production with a role that suddenly seems more significant, but it seems to me that as much of the strength of the characterisation here is also down to how it is performed.

Whatever you make of the Bayreuth stage production, musically it's a glorious affair that does open up the work and reveal new qualities. It's not a forceful, driving Wagnerian interpretation, but one that finds the true delicacy and poignancy within what is surely the most Romantic of Wagner's works on the misunderstood, suffering artist as national or social hero. Alex Kober's conducting of the orchestra is outstanding and the chorus are superb, as they really have to be in this particular work. There's not a trace of heavy-handedness, yet all the force and dynamic of the work is there, measured and applied in such a way that it works hand-in-hand with the production.

The singing likewise is never forced. I thought at first that Camilla Nylund was underpowered here as Elisabeth. Knowing what she is capable of, it sounded like she was conserving her voice, but the more gentle delivery and the colour that Nylund is able to apply actually pays dividends with Elisabeth and her nature here. This is also borne out in the performances of Michelle Breedt's Venus,  but particularly in Markus Eiche's excellent and impressive Wolfram. The complex character of Tannhuser is another matter however, and requires a different approach. Torsten Kerl achieves a good balance between the more lyrical side of his character and the Romantic heldentenor, his performance also covering all the playfulness, bawdiness, irreverence and the more serious, spiritual as well as the vainglorious sides of the character.

The Opus Arte Blu-ray release presents all the colour and brightness of the busy Bayreuth stage very well. Spread over two BD50 discs, there is the option to view the musical performance alone or, if you've an hour or so to spare and are interested in the set as an art installation piece, you can view it interspersed with all the extra performance art set-pieces in-between. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1, both giving an impressive full uncompressed true HD sound. The interviews on the disc and in the booket provide much more useful information about the concept. Subtitles on the disc are English, French, German and Korean only.",1438473600,5,4226,5.073381294964029
