And Saint Seiya was the first anime I watched ever even if it was under another name. Knights of the Zodiac, I think it was  the rename of it, but sooner or later I went and refound it again over line and watched it from there and then I went on and to ask my dad to buy it for my birthday. I only hope that one day they will complete on doing the fully version of saint Seiya like it is in japan. And don't edit all the good stuff out.",1516924800,,629,3.765151515151515

I haven't finished all 159 episodes yet but I finished the Sanctuary story.  There is two slight issues: there was a part in one episode that it could not play and I had to skip through that part and the problem resolved; my 2nd problem was they have 1 episode being out of order, it was skipped and then put back in 2 episodes later.  It didn't bother me as I've seen it before and I know how the story was supposed to be.

UPDATE:  It is missing Hades: Santuary 1-13.",1493769600,,641,4.427350427350428
