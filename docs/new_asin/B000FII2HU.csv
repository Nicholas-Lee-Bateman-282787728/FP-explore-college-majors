8123108,3,B000FII2HU,Anything that will educate people as to the artistic genius of Kertesz is a good thing...to my way of thinking....This black and white photographer was among the earliest masters..It was great to see some of his photos (although there are many more that could have been shown and were not)....I enjoyed the video...,1284249600,3,315,4.962264150943396
8123109,4,B000FII2HU,"I think this documentary is well-made and has a balanced view of Kertesz. Possibly I am biased because Kertesz is one of my favorite photographers and I own all or almost all the books about him. However, I enjoyed the interviews with him and the selection of his photographs chosen for this film.",1232928000,5,297,4.622641509433962
8123110,2,B000FII2HU,"I've never heard of this artist or his work, but I think photography fans will like this documentary.  It was easy for me that think, ""This guy is the Ionesco of photography.""  However, Ionesco was Romanian and this guy was Hungarian.  Just as many African-American artists moved to France in the mid-20th century, maybe Eastern Europeans did the same thing.  This work was made in the 1970s and it has that '70s style that even ""The Simpsons"" once mocked.  If I were a betting man, I'd say this artist is dead, but I don't want to jinx him if he's alive.  His broken English is adorable and may remind many of their foreign-born grandparents.  The work starts with him flipping through his photos, but he's just tossing them around on his kitchen table.  There is no focus on each one individually, so it almost cheapens his oeuvre.  I kinda watched this passively, but I think many will like it.",1209081600,5,897,4.591194968553459
