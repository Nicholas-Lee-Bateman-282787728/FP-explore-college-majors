6016705,5,B00FPP99MK,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Metallica live in concert 21 times, and many of those shows I was literally at their feet, on the rail.
This incredible concert film took me up ON the stage, and right NEXT to them, as they played. This is the closest thing next to seeing a live Metallica show, the sound is epic and the visuals are breathtaking.

This is a 92 minute music video with an interesting apocalyptic sci-fi/ horror fantasy weaving in and out of the live concert performances.  Actor Dane Dehaan, who was hand-picked by drummer Lars Ulrich for the role, turns in an excellent, deep and gritty performance as Trip, a roadie on an errand. What Trip encounters during his journey, and the metaphors involved in the story, were intentionally left open to interpretation by the band,  for the viewers.

Besides the incredible 3D visuals and epic concert sound, what impressed me the most about the film was the editing....
the way the scenes segue into the concert performances, and how they accent Metallica's incredible , powerful music ,
I believe the editing deserves an Oscar nod. The music and visuals during "" Battery"", for example, had me headbanging and thrashing around in my seat like a Neanderthal....and I'm a feminine 50 year-old chick !

I viewed this movie in IMAX 3D FIVE times in the movie theater, I just couldn't get enough of it.
The 3rd time, I took my kid brother with me, who has never seen Metallica live, but he is fairly familiar with their catalogue.
He gave it a 10 out of 10, saying ""  They couldn't have made it any better ! ""

If you enjoy having your mind blown by incredible metal musicianship, showmanship , stamina and execution,
this film is for you.  And the band seated on stools in the empty arena performing "" Orion "" during the closing credits , is a moving tribute to Cliff Burton and a highlight for many fans. 5 Stars.",1389312000,79,1870,4.577844311377246

6016708,5,B00FPP99MK,"Loved the initial release of the film but I was hoping to see some additional songs added to the Blu Ray that weren't included in the original theatrical release. Initial reports claimed that there were going to be various versions of the film released, some of which were to include bonus songs but recent reports make no mention of the bonus songs. Can anyone shed some light on this issue? Are there supposed to be bonus songs in any of the upcoming Blu Ray versions???",1388361600,2,472,4.564705882352941

6016710,5,B00FPP99MK,"I've seen Metallica live on 3 separate occasions through the years, up against the stage or sitting in seats on a second level and maybe you have too but I can guarantee you have not seen the band this way. I saw the movie in Imax and was blown away by the visual presentation and the audio was phenomenal! I'm not a fan of 3-D movie at home but I'm specifically buying the 3 disc set to get the Bluray disc and the 3-D disc along with the special features.... truly amazing concert footage!",1387324800,3,491,4.23404255319149

6016713,4,B00FPP99MK,"The movie was excellent. Having said that...I will not buy this Blu-Ray or give it 5 stars unless there is another version on disc 2 that has a complete show. Filmed but not included in the theatre version were;

Sad But True
Sanitarium
Seek and Destroy
Fade To Black

There were also some other props used during those songs like the gigantic toilet that James spray painted ""Metal Up Yer Ass!!"" on, which did not make the theater version also. If those songs appear on this DVD, I would then rate it 5 stars, but Amazon needs to be more descriptive about what is on disc #2.",1386547200,6,576,4.373831775700935

6016776,4,B00FPP99MK,"Let me start by firstly admitting I'm not a huge Metallica fan I can handle their music though I consider them inoffensive and have seen and heard a lot of their music over the last 25 years since I was given a taped cassette of their '91 breakthrough self-titled album to be pretty familiar with their material.

 In recent years to their credit in my opinion Metallica have been experimenting with things a bit. They've now left their record label and taken back ownership of their back catalogue a very empowering development for any band let alone one that has sold more than 50 million albums.

 Metallica also decided to do a very arty double album with the late Lou Reed essentially operating as his backing band on 'Lulu' which I have but still haven't listened to yet although it's considered horrendously bad. They also decided to start their own music festival 'Orion Music + More' which only lasted two years before folding and creating this Metallica movie which despite good reviews flopped at the box office. Both of those last two ventures cost the band millions of dollars.

 I recently bought the 3D Blu-ray steelbook version of 'Metallica: Through The Never' it was directed by Nimrod Antal (who directed the very underrated Predator sequel 'Predators') and essentially it is a Metallica concert with a little story interspersed following a young roadie Trip (Dane DeHaan) being sent on an errand to collect a precious bag for the band and he basically going to hell and back in his journey to get back to the arena.

 It's not much of a storyline although there is a bit of blood and action and the 'movie' scenes have a gritty dirty look adding to the foreboding atmosphere. I've certainly never seen anything like it from a band before and quite enjoyed watching it.",1463702400,,1788,4.745161290322581

6016785,3,B00FPP99MK,"Although, I am finally buying this DVD (unlike St. Anger) I am still slightly disappointed.  I waited for this concert a long time to be released.  When I first saw the YouTube clips of their 30th anniversary I knew this was a badass show, and being a hardcore Metallica fan since ""Ride"" was released (minus St. Anger of course).  This had to be in my collection.

The concert footage itself is the best of the best concert stage props and most requested Metallica songs.  Problem is they overeditted the video to cram it into 90 minutes (that means songs are editted or removed from the original show).  Next they added a character to the movie who we believe was sent on a mission to get the first Baby Metal album (inside joke).

After seeing the film a few times, it does grow on you which is why I am purchasing it, but still wish they had released this one time show in its entirety for the Metallica fans to enjoy.",1458864000,,921,4.382352941176471

(but on the other hand, I think he knows that). kirk is awesome as well. if u are a metallica fan from way back and have followed them throughout the last 30 years, this is a must see movie.

6016960,4,B00FPP99MK,"It would be a lie to say I ever expected to find myself reviewing a concert film, and it would be an even bigger one if I told you I had even the slightest understanding of what went on once I finished Metallicas latest endeavor, Through The Never. Ambitious in theory and execution, Through The Never attempts to deviate from the monotony of watching a taped concert by throwing something different in the mix: a narrativeand I must emphasize the word attempts here. I would be hard pressed to classify this as a complete failure, but its no home run, either.

Metallica has a pretty big track record when it comes to making weird decisions, and Through The Never is no exception. Still, there is something oddly satisfying about the end result that makes it physically impossible for me to bash this film completely. It should be noted that I use the term film lightly because, in reality, Through The Never is so distant from traditional films that it kind of stands in a class of its own.

Of course, the big draw here would be Metallicas name plastered on the front. The repellent, on the other hand, would be the poor marketing that made it impossible to decipher what exactly this film was, which is the same reason I passed when it was in theaters. Was it a movie or a concert? There was no concrete answerthere still isnt, reallyand this is because it is neither. By taking a set of concerts from Vancouver in 2012 and weaving in a tale about a roadie, Through The Never is unexplainable and easily misunderstood.

Ask anyone what the story is abouteven the members of the bandand nine times out of ten youll get the response, I have no f***ing idea. The gist of it is that Metallica needs something very important for the show tonight, and the manager sends Trip (Dane DeHaan) off to pick it up from the broken down van on the side of the road. Chaos soon ensues, and most of the audience is left scratching their head in confusion as they try to understand whats going on.

This confusion is the result of two things: a lack of clarity and a lack of time. The band doesnt know what its about, the director has no clue, and a group of theorist in a Grantland comment section are the only ones providing solace. Their theory is that the storyhowever minimalis a metaphor for the struggle the band went through losing Cliff. Their arguments are strong, convincing, and surprisingly believable, which is why Ive chosen to side with them on the issueseriously, Google Through The Never explained. It should be the first result.

This narrative is only a small fraction of the experience, however, so its great that the concert footage is not only beautifully directed, but also a lot of fun to watch. Those who find joy in listening to the bands entire catalog are going to have a blast while elitists who only listen to pre-Black Album Metallica may not. The setlist includes all the major hits like One, Enter Sandman, and Master of Puppets, in addition to others like Ride the Lightening's title track and Hit the Lights.

My biggest complaint with the performance was the spectacle of it all. I have actually never seen the band perform live in person, but apparently this is commonplace for Metallica concerts. During the shows 90 minutes, there is an electric chair hanging from the ceiling, crosses rising from the ground, and the buildingand destruction ofLady Justice. Its very chaotic and distracting, which makes me feel like I would have been annoyed had I seen this live. Again, its interesting in theory, but it gives the performance more of a cinematic touch, whereas I feel live shows should be more personal.

Overall Score: 8.5/10 - Through The Never's ambitions stop this from being the best concert film ever created, but Metallica fans are going to enjoy it nonetheless. The footage is crystal clear, the sound is marvelous, and the setlist, in my opinion, is fantasticthough they did leave out my favorite song, The Shortest Straw. I'm one of those people who actually wanted more out of the story, but I'll settle for what we got accompanied by the theories I've read. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Dane DeHaan gave a great performance without saying more than Hey! a handful of times.",1402272000,,4211,4.66711590296496

All this/these new formulaic, wimpy, pop music/pop stars should learn from these guys, this music was from an era when you actually had to know how to play your instrument/sing (without auto-tune) and have some real talent before you could actually be a bona-fide ""star"". Nowadays seems all you need is ""the look"" and some sorry-ass, cash hungry, soulless record company backing you and you can be a ""pop-star"". God help us -- to what level have we allowed (us as parents) this new generation (our kids) to fall to??? To accept the crap played on the radio nowadays as ""good music""??? C'mon, give me a break!!! Heavy Metal (especially thrash metal) rules!!! On the bright side there is some hope, groups like Avenged Sevenfold who continue to ""carry the torch"" of awesome, melodic, thrash metal. We need many more like these -- with the same level (or more) of musicianship and a hell of alot more airplay. I guess I'll just keep prayin' the music scene will eventually come full circle and that maybe in a few years the airwaves will be full of the kind of ""magical"" music we used to hear when I was in high school in the late 70's early 80's.

DeHaan does a great job as the introvert weirdo who breaks out and comes through against amazing (though imaginary) odds, and the visual effects were terrific in the side-story.

6016967,3,B00FPP99MK,"This is a good concert film, the ""movie"" part is just an sidebar annoyance. Some roadie want-a-be kid, for some unknown reason, has to fetch some package with unknown contents  He gets in a car wreck, encounters some weird characters and get dragged by a horse.  There is really no ""plot"" to this story and it has no link to the otherwise straight up Metallica concert footage.  Concert sound is terrific, I suggest turning it up as loud as your neighbors can tolerate and enjoy.  I can't believe they are still doing the silly staged sound system collapse road crew panic thing.  Band members with their fake ""OMG what just happened?!"" expressions is just plain stupid.  The dude on fire flailing his arms in the air still makes me laugh though.

I've been a Metallica fan since they were a nothing club band and I have to say their schtick has become a bit worn out.  Kirk Hammet continues to be incredible and Robert Trujillo is fantastic.

In a preconcert scene in the very beginning, a fan in the parking lot drops several MF bombs, but once you are past that the language was not noticable.  The mini-adventure film woven in here was a bit distracting, but added some interesting visuals to break up the concert fotage (again, young ones attention spans actually appreciated the breaks).

6016973,3,B00FPP99MK,"First of all let me say I am huge Metallica fan but also a videophile who always expect the best paying premium for HD content. This review is not about the concert/movie which was great as many admit, it is about quality of picture and sound offered on Blu Ray 2D and 3D releases. I had a chance to compare Through the Never side by side with Quebec Magnetic Blu Ray release. I also seen 3D IMAX version of the show last September. During test I used Optoma HD83 3D projector with 106 inch screen and 55 inch LCD HDTV. The audio was running through Yamaha RX-S600 receiver powering Polk Audio speaker setup: front RTiA3 x 2 + center CSiA4 +  surround RTiA1 x 2 + PSW125 sub).

First let me say the sound quality is amazing. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 does the trick which brings sound experience in new level. I personally prefer the use of Yamaha DSP where simulated Concert Hall in Munich expanded sound space even more making it concert like experience. Interestingly, quick switching to Quebec Magnetic blu ray reveals sound with much more attenuated trebles so slight pre-amplifier setting correction is necessary. But Through the Never sounds better than ever.

Now for the picture. To those who had a chance to see, the original IMAX 3D show raised the bar for visual experience. Matching it in home is often impossible but owning several 2D and 3D IMAX and traditional blu ray releases of different movies and concerts, I can say I have pretty good idea what to expect from over 100 inches in diameter picture. First let me say that the concert looks great on 55 inch TV, like most of HD Blu ray releases, sharp and somehow crips. However when projected on 106 inch screen, it does not look so good anymore. The calibrated Optoma projector reveals picture to be not as sharp as I would expect. When I started to watch the blue ray 2D version, I though there is something wrong with my projector and its focus. After careful check it was not a projector but the quality of transfer of the motion picture. Comparing to superior quality of Quebec Magnetic blu ray release, the Through the Never transfer is poor and lacks clarity. After reading all these positive reviews and experiencing show in the IMAX, I was expecting the best out of BD release but got disappointed instead. I wish Through the Never has picture quality at least as good as concert in Quebec. But it does not.

Aside of watching 2D version sold by Amazon, I purchased also Deluxe Box Set directy from band website with 2D and 3D versions. The 3D version of the concert has same flaw where picture transfer is poor with lack of clarity and lack of sharpness. Another disappointment comes from the fact both 2D and 3D versions are transferred to disk in 2.40:1 aspect ratio format which makes 1/3 of the screen unusable (black bard on top and bottom). Stretching it to eliminate these black bars to fill entire TV or projector 16:9 screen makes picture even more fuzzy and unsharp as original material is poor in a first place. As for the 3D experience those of you who appreciate entire 16:9 screen filled especially when watching 3D movies know exactly what I am talking about. Because of undesired 2.40:1 aspect ratio also in 3D version and unsharp picture transfer, the three-dimensional effect leaves lots of space for improvement.

I had a chance to watch both concerts: Through the Never and Quebec Magnetic both on Blu Ray with a company of two other Metallica fans and we all agreed there is something wrong with the picture in the first one. Overall, the picture quality of latest Metallica show release turned to be a huge disappointment.

To me 2D and 3D releases of Through the Never are truly missed opportunity to bring great show of iconic performer to home theater. With all the effort they put into making this show, releasing it in the IMAX, with all technical bells and whistles available to make the transfer to blu ray best in quality, the result is a real shame.

Pros:
- great sound with master audio track
- great performance, show
Cons:
- poor high definition picture transfer
- bad aspect ration for 3D version",1400630400,2,4113,4.626027397260274

6016984,5,B00FPP99MK,"This was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a documentary on Metallica with concert footage but that is not what this is at all.

What I would call this is one long music video with two setting. Inside the arena Metallica rock and party to an awesome, adrenaline pumping live concert. Outside the arena the city is in total chaos. There are riots, carnage, era transcending warriors on horseback, and club wielding mobs. The only things missing are zombies and a clear story line.

The two settings are blended seamlessly in a video that could not possibly be any more metal. Music videos don't always have a clearly defined storyline and leave things up to the viewer to write their own back story.  I loved it.",1399939200,,719,4.6015625

6016996,5,B00FPP99MK,"I read the 1 star reviews because I was curious how someone could rent/buy a Metallica DVD and be disappointed.  I actually understand after reading the comments why a big percent of the 1-star customers were upset.  The cover does look menacing and coupled with the previews it is a bit misleading if you are expecting an awesome movie experience.

I went in with a very open mind and little if any expectation. It was truly out of curiosity that I made the purchase at all. As a long time fan of the early days of Metallica I wanted to see what they were like now.  The last live show was on their ""Justice"" tour. I was not very impressed with a lot of their stuff after that. I thought they were a little too mainstream and figured they lost some of that fire they had before money and the world softened them.  The movie is really just a concert from 2013 and they have mixed in a future/primitive/apocalyptic themed story line.  Not really much of a movie as a stand alone film.  I have to believe it was just an attempt to add imagery to the show, to keep a distracted attention deficit generation involved.

It worked for me, lol...  I give the ""Movie"" 2 stars and the show a solid 5.  The song-list includes all my favorites and the stage and show is unbelievable.  I would love to see this concert live.  METALLICA showed me they still have that fire and it still burns bright.

Thanks for an incredible experience.

Live music with an actual movie fading in and out at the same time. It turned out to be a lot of Metallica (not a bad thing) and a little bit of this random roadie kid that comes across... vacant streets? Because of some sort of protest? But it's a bad protest? Because the people are chasing him for some reason? And then it's over. I would've rather just watched Metallica live. Spare me a storyline if there is none.,1398643200,2,580,4.330275229357798

It was my own fault for not checking the previous reviews or description, due to the fact that I expected the documentary to be an upbeat version of some people enjoying themselves at a concert.  The concert was pretty good. Horror movie lovers may enjoy the movie backdrop for the concert. This is because the movie ended up being a dystopian take on a young Metallica roadie having to fight for his life against some beings that looked like they came from a dark world and/or dimension. Aside from this caveat (and the fact that the Unforgiven was not performed), the concert included many great hard rock songs such as the classic Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, and One.",1397865600,2,815,4.6923076923076925
6017011,3,B00FPP99MK,"The idea of combining movie and live or just music is nothing new.  After 5 min of watching Through The Never, I had the impression I was up for the Metallica Version of Moonwalker (and during ...And Justice for All, a little bit of ""this is...Spinal Tap""'s Stonehenge as well as the Orion end's credit (the ""jazz"" tour part of ""This is...Spinal Tap"")) supported by Phil Collins on the drums (does Lars Ulrich start looking like Phil Collins, doesn't he?)

The main problem is the movie/concert/whatever is a flimsy short story (I am not sure if you could call it a story) with some after taste of John Carpenter's Ghost of Mars supported by some well-known Metallica songs giving more or less the mood to the story.  This does not work because the songs where not made to support the movie... This is not a sort of Queensryche Operation Mindcrime or Dream Theater's Metropolis.  This is even more true since one horsemen shows up (and you expect three more to come around...), they don't even play the four horsemen (or the Mechanics...)!

Rather than using classical songs (which are shot live almost perfectly... but everyone knows that Metallica is releasing great live), they should have release a full concept album supporting the story... Point missed right there!!! (and hence my only three stars because I sort of enjoy Through The Never with the quite disappointing ending calling for some live ""sequel"" and the redo of cunning stunts.).

6017019,4,B00FPP99MK,"1st and foremost. While I am a die-hard Metallica fan, Fan Club member etc., when they made the trailers for this movie/concert, they TOTALLY screwed that up BIG TIME.. It had some of the worst advertising I have ever seen for any movie or concert film. The message the advertising agency conveyed was moronic..""DONT DIE THIS WEEKEND W/O SEEING METALLICA"".  Um...what? Really? ARE U FLIPPING KIDDING ME? ..The movie poster should have read, For the 1st time ever, be on stage WITH Metallica..or..See thew movie that changes the future of concert films...A NEW Standard has been set.....(THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULDA BEEN, because if you saw it in IMAX...wow.)
  YES, The narrative portion is...different.. Its the story of a Roadie having too got find one of the Band's  broken down van that has, ""something"" in the back that the Band really needs, so he's gotta find it and bring it back before the show ends. (ok..not too hard to understand. Now right before he goes to find this van, he takes some ""pill"", and leaves.
  Now as ""TRIPP"", the Roadie, on this journey, Metallica is putting on of the their greatest shows as usual, and the songs they play is is coinciding with the total break down in society that is happening around Tripp.  I won't give any more details on the plot etc....but I will say this.....
  PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND! The movie was shot in FULL HD 3D IMAX, with thee most elaborate stage-set up in history. The MOP Crosses rising up from the stage....the RTL Electric Chair w/ huge Tesla coils attached w/ electricity flowing, Doris..aka Lady Justice Statue, Death Magnetic Coffins, A Metal Up Your Ass"""" giant toilet w/ Knife blade coming out of the bow and Cunning Stunts! l
  EVERY ICONIC METALLICA IMAGE/OBJECT from their mind-blowing stage shows, is built into this stage. The ""MAIN"" thing the band wanted too to, was NOT create the same-ole same-ole concert film. Or have a movie about a concert. What they wanted too do was utilize the 3D HD, so when you saw it in IMAX, YOU, the Fan,weren't watching the band from the fans normal view.. You were watching the fans, from the BAND's point of view! So you were ON-STAGE with them, giving the fans a different point of view, being part of the band, ON STAGE looking out too the crowd. Cause that's is how they see the fans every night, and they wanted too convey that too all fans and basically have you on stage WITH METALLICA.
  Now if ANYONE saw it in IMAX 3D like I did, without ANY hesitation, and taking my fan-boy hat off, it was by far the COOLEST, MOST BAD-ASS CONCERT FILM EVER! PERIOD! It was sick. YOU FELT LIKE YOU WERE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TOO OR IN FRONT OF LARS' DRUM SET AS HE'S PLAYING...Next too James, Kirk and Robert....the Iconic symbols from Metallica's album were IN YOUR FACE! IT WAS TRULY MIND BLOWING!
  As far as the Regular version goes, the show is still kick ass and a killer Metallica show, but losing that IMAX thrill, takes a lot of way from it. Seeing it in 3D Is still cool and works really great! But not that much where you will hate it.  The concert, while still awesome, was viewed differently as by the responses above of expectations etc...Metallica wanted too make a different kind of Concert movie, that had a narrative that was driven BY the music itself. They succeeded in that.

I have to admit though, the story of the kid going through all the KAOS, was a little weird to me. It was ok, and I'm sure in an IMAX theater it would've looked totally awesome, but for the most part, I didn't get it.  It didn't matter though because I'm a die hard fan and I would've bought it even if everyone said it was crap!  Metallica was rockin the whole way through and that's what I wanted to see and hear.

6017046,5,B00FPP99MK,"If you are anything like me, the music of Metallica helped define your teenage years.  Back in the late 80s and early 90s, this bands music was a constant on my stereo, and as such, helped me through some bad times.  With heavy riffs and darkly poetic lyrics, Metallica poured life into me when I thought I wasn't going to make it.  And as a result, Ive been a huge fan ever since.  But imagine my surprise when I heard the band had teamed up with director Nimrod Antal to create a film within one of their concerts!  Ive been a fan of Antal for a while now, and his film PREDATORS is a huge favorite of mine.  This collaboration produced one of the greatest concert films ever made, and regardless of whether you are a fan of the band or not, youll want to see this!

Several bands have used music to tell stories before (i.e. Queensryche with Operation: Mindcrime), but few have ever used an actual concert as the basis for a film.  But METALLICA THROUGH THE NEVER is not just an eye-popping spectacle of raw powerits also a riveting and bizarre story that takes young Trip on a journey hell never forget.  Nor will we, the audience, for that matter.

METALLICA THROUGH THE NEVER is shot extremely well, and I would daresay it looks amazing.  As mentioned above, multiple cameras are used to document the stage performance, and the result is spectacular.  The viewer is onstage with the band for almost its entire performance, allowing for full immersion into the concert and giving an experience like no other.

Likewise, Trips journey, which is intermixed with the concert, showcases even more expert cinematography.  Set against the backdrop of a dark and foreboding landscape, the events that happen outside of the stadium are shocking and filmed in a visionary style.  I never once felt like I was watching two separate entities; Trips experiences and the concert are woven together like an intricate tapestry, and the final product is nothing short of amazing.

It is this bold and unique experience that truly sets METALLICA THROUGH THE NEVER above all other concert films.  Despite the excellent soundtrack that features classic Metallica songs like Creeping Death, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Fuel, Wherever I May Roam, Master of Puppets, and so many others, the originality of this movie alone makes it a must-own.  Regardless of whether you are a new fan or an old veteran of the bands music, pick this up today.  And be sure to snag it on Blu-ray for the out-of-this-world sound and picture quality.  You won't regret it.",1395273600,,2532,4.711363636363636

I love the early stuff but anything after ""Fuel"" seems to have lost it's impact with me. I was excited to watch this in Bluray on the home theater and the sound quality did not disappoint. It lets an older guy feel like he's back at a show. The problem I have (and this may spoil it for you too) is the crowd at the show. It seems like in order to keep the video quality up, the lighting, etc., feels fake and offsets the intensity of a Metallica Show. This is produced like a staged concert. Not a recording of an actual show. So when they pan out to the crowd,they look like ""cheesy extras"" acting like Metallica fans. If you can see past that and let it just run in your mind like a very long music video that has no plot (which I didn't care about) the imagery and music gets those hairs on the back of your neck standing tall. Beyond that my only wish, would be for more.",1394841600,,968,4.046875

6017062,4,B00FPP99MK,"It's interesting how over time, people either expand their artistic interests or just dive deeper into what is familiar and comfortable.  Although I've always enjoyed music going back to the little portable 45 rpm player of my teens, there are some musical styles that never rung my bell.  One of those was the heavy metal bands that began to make some noise (literally) in the late 1970's.  Metallica, formed in 1981, was one of the early groups and perhaps the genres most successful.  A few years ago I caught an interview with the band on TV, supplemented with some clips of their performance and thought I'd pay more attention.

I never saw this movie in IMAX or 3D or hell, not even in Blu ray, but Netflix did send me a DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not to be dismissive of the format, the film is really a very well-produced 90 minute music video.  I'll get to the music in a minute.  The drama interspersed between or during songs stars Dane DeHaan (""Chronicle"") as a roadie named Trip.  I'm not sure roadie is the right description either.  He's more of a gopher and is tasked to take some gas into town (Vancouver, B.C.) where one of the band's trucks has run out of fuel.  He pops a pill or two before his journey and Trip goes trippin' in more ways than one.

He's confronted with an empty city, but for some violent protesters who are standing off the police or vice versa.  In any case, he's chased, and is confronted by a gas-masked horseman straight out of a Mad Max movie.  So what the hell does this have to do with a filmed music concert?  Not sure, but the Metallica quartet (James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo) know how to get the dust out of your ears.  I had a couple subwoofers jumping out of their spikes.

One of the things that strikes me most about these guys is that there are no supporting musicians helping them out.  At least none that I could see.  No guitar support, no keyboards, no strings, no backup singers, nada.  Just some hammering rock.  Frankly, I didn't know hardly any of the songs, but I loved the driving force behind them.  This is a big concert played in front of a big crowd in a big indoor arena in Canada.  Their production includes lasers, a big stage in-the-round with the 3 axe-swingers moving furiously about the stage while Ulrich beats his drum kit to death.

I have mixed feeling about the Trip adventure but that piece was written by the guys, so fine with me.  Still some may find it a silly distraction.  For me, it gave me an opportunity to rest my aging ears a bit.  I'll likely bite on the Blu ray in the future.  Now let's discuss a little opera....  Naw, but here's the set list:
1. The Ecstasy of Gold
 2. Creeping Death
 3. For Whom the Bell Tolls
 4. Fuel
 5. Ride the Lightning
 6. One
 7. The Memory Remains
 8. Wherever I May Roam
 9. Cyanide
 10. And Justice for All

The huge amount of effort they put on every single detail of the movie, and noy just the single story in which DeHaan stars, but the entire concepto of the concert and every single detail they developed was awesome!!!

I loved it so much, that my dad and I went for a 2 time to watch it!! xD So when i knew they were releasing the blu-ray I knew I had to buy this for my dad so we can watch it over and over any time we want xD Truly amazing!!! truly exciting!!

Anger came out ... Totally rubbish . That's the good thing about watching this concert they play absolutely nothing from st.anger . The concert is all their greats , ride the lightning , battery , master of puppets , even when it's all over the band gets together to play ORION , totally surprising .

6017079,3,B00FPP99MK,while this is basicly a concert movie they try to infuse a story with it and at places it works.  without giving anything away its about a roadies journey to get something the band needs for the show.  at the end you don't know what it was or even if he arrived on time or late.  while its a semi fun ride its probably better to keep the two separate. applaud metallica for trying to do something new and different.

Those 15 minutes are incoherent, irrelevant, and ultimately have no explanation anything (music or themselves).

I saw Metallica in Souix  Falls SD on their tour for the black album. No opening act just 3plus hours on nothing but Metallica. I saw them in arrowhead stadium in with G N R and Body Count.

The super high def picture was top of the line. The performance for a Metallica that is past their prime was pretty good. For me their best captured live performance was in the Live S*** Binge and Purge Seattle 1989 show. That was Metallica at their very best. This show that was 24 years later is still a good one, but for Metallica fans that have known the band for more than 20 years this Blu Ray is not for you. Or me. I still thought the movie was not needed but it really
was cool for what happens at the end. That was the best part for me. The ending for me is what I expected and it was great because it is left for the viewer to figure that out. Then to close it off with a classic instrumental which for me was the best song of the show.  All in all it was worth the 90 plus minutes of Metallica, I just wish there was a version that had all of the songs from that show, without the movie. A 2 plus hour Metallica movie with the high end production would have been to my liking. That's Metallica for you. Well there you have it.

Although I could've just watched the concert without the cut scenes they already have many other live concert videos available.

I thought it was different in a good way. Very inventive, entertaining and it captured my attention the whole time.

If your a long time fan or have only heard they're 'radio hits' this is definitely worth buying and having in your concert collection.",1392854400,,543,4.891304347826087

It comprises most of their iconic songs (except for ones like Fade To Black, Sad But True, Ride The Lightning and Seek & Destroy.....unfortunately) into one outstanding live cinematic performance. The movie is about a young roadie who goes on an epic adventure to get something the band absolutely needs to continue on with their tour and is his adventure gets more suspenseful and intense, Metallica plays their songs in the background as if the kid is living the excitement of the songs through his journey.

6017141,4,B00FPP99MK,"Sorry, I like this film and I've been listening to Metallica going on 30 years, but seriously they blew it on the blu-ray and they should be ashamed.

For the years of Blu-Ray 3D the standard has been a $20ish dollar 2D or a $30ish 3D + 2D pacage. Metallica instead says it's $20 for one $30 for the other $60 for both??? Way to pay service to the fans. We already shelled out almost $30 in IMAX tickets, now I have to buy it twice to watch it in 3D or 2D? WTF. That's just bad marketing. NO ONE releases like this but then again Metallica is so out of touch in there bubble that they don't get the fans anymore and they don't have any idea how the industry works. OR they didn't make the box office and they hope double-popping the fans for both disk will earn back for them. Either way, it's not cool. I got the 2D version, I would have paid $10 extra for both in one box but I won't pay $20 for the one disk plus an extra disk I already own!!!

Also Metallica had leaked out a three-version on one disk concept with a full concert (complete with cut songs) the theatrical version and a version that showed more of the narrative story. That didn't happen. Probably coming in six months for another $119.99, right? But it will have a lithograph and fake guitar picks like the cool coffin 6 years ago!!!

6017145,3,B00FPP99MK,"I did purchase this item, however, from a local retailer.  There are several pros and cons about this 3D concept.  At one point, Metallica were my favorite band until i got into Sabbath, Rush, Priest, and Maiden.  I still like their first five albums along with some of the load and magnetic stuff.  I'm far from a Metallica hater, but this could have been much better.

I once saw a Zeppelin 3D light show filled with images and visual stories with their songs.  I thought something similar would have worked much better than having both the movie and concert being juxtaposed. There were certainly better Metallica songs that could have worked better on 3D.  In fairness, i thought the lightning idea with the chair and Tesla effect worked well.  I always felt the Hammet solo in lightning was simulating an electrocution. The song was played well, i have a 1985  bootleg which i like better.

The band could have elected to have short 3D movie clip intros to songs that we see in many concerts.  Once again, i don't care for the movie.  The fact that the script was written in haste by Director Nimrod Antal shows the lack of creativity in it.

My biggest issue is the lack of songs. They should have added as a bonus some of the songs left out which were a few instead of the extras we got instead.  Rush's Blu-ray of the ""Clockwork Angels"" tour has over 30 songs with the usual extras.  Even Metallica on their Quebec Magnetic release has about 10 more songs there than here.

The Extras weren't much to write home about.  Mainly interviews plugging the movie as it was the greatest concert/movie idea since Pink Floyd's Wall.  Producer Charlotte Huggins was a bit annoying as she kept repeating the story about her husband telling her to take the job, who admits never even own a Metallica album.  When Hetfield talks about how he may leave his daughter the bill for the film its both insulting and patronizing.  The film's budget was roughly $18 million with advertising maybe $30 million, he and Ulrich are worth about $300 million each.  He is still in good shape. There is no way the band would throw their entire fortune in this risky project.

Overall, this is a decent concert with a horrible movie narrative.  The audience has difficulty associating  the ""Trip"" character with any of the concert material.  One of the few bright spots is when the PA system fails during lightning, it's one of the rare spontaneous moments during the set. Overall, decent could have been much better with a different 3D concept and more songs included. Metallica should focus more on making new albums than future projects as this.",1392508800,,2627,4.671023965141612

6017147,2,B00FPP99MK,"Having been a fan since the early days and seeing many Metallica live performances on VHS/DVD and Blue Ray the only thought coming to mind is ""disappointment.""

I'll be honest as to why I gave it two stars: Cons
- ""live"" performance sounded as if much of it was remixed in the studio
- Somewhat disinterested crowd seen during performance.  Probably due to multiple takes of same song/scene.
- Storyline only interfered with ""performance""
- Song selection was way too predictable and catalog played is starting to sound dated
- More Death Magnetic and St. Anger both of which sound great live should've been added.
- Just an overall boring performance.  Cue Judas Priest's recent live blue ray for an amazing metal performance.

Pro's
- Great Dolby 5.1 sound
- Best song is Orion being played in the closing credits",1392508800,2,815,4.8

The movie is in complete Metallica ""ANTI-PIRACY"" mode. Every song is interrupted by the story of the masked kid and the apocalypse. They interrupt the song so you can't rip it and put it on your iPod of share on bit-torrant.",1392422400,,481,4.465909090909091
6017149,3,B00FPP99MK,"I consider myself a Metallica fan even if I'm not that fanatical about them.  I buy the albums and videos, go to the concerts, and in general keep up with their releases.  I knew this was a 3D film and looked forward to the 3D blu-ray release.  I mistakenly assumed the 3D film was included in this release.  I did now know it was a Best Buy Exclusive.  Like many other 3D releases, I thought it would just be another option on the blu-ray menu.  The Smashing Pumpkins Live in NYC is a good example of a 3D/2D release that's not marked as 3D. So it's my fault for not researching thoroughly but I also don't think a release needs to be this complicated with different versions, exclusive venders, and inflated prices.  Considering how poorly this film did in the theaters i would have thought they would make it easier to purchase.  I'm a sucker and I'll probably buy their next release also, but I know now to wait and see rather than pre-order and assume.

The film is good, not great, the concert segments are well filmed and capture the performances well.  It could have been longer.  A typical metallica concert is longer and the CD soundtrack has two additional songs.  It would have been nice for them to at least include those songs as bonus's.  With the exception of the master of puppets video, all the extras are non-music related and somewhat disappointing.  For a big release like this I can't help but be disappointed.",1392336000,3,1432,4.521400778210117
6017150,5,B00FPP99MK,"I think it is beyond a stretch to say if you are not a fan of Metallica that you still love this.  That is silly.  It is 90% concert.
The production value of the concert is without peer.  So many cameras and so many views . . . and outside of the up high shots, you never see camera men running around.
The songs played . . . of course it depends on your tastes.

The 'movie' part.  It is very well done and has cool/creepy scenes in an empty city.  The plot is light, which should be expected, but is done very well.  The main character basically never says anything, but he plays the part well.

I found the 'failing' stage stuff lame to be honest.  But it did make a cool final in concert song with them all near each other.  But I would have left out this story line.

Them playing Orion during the credits while sitting in an empty arena is worth the rental price alone.

I'm an enormous fan of their other concert movies (Live S***, Cunning Stunts, S&M), each for different reasons.  This one is easily the most polished--razor sharp visuals and excellent sound.  The guys are a bit older, James doesn't growl as much, and doesn't sling his guitar quite as low, but they are faster than ever.  The editing is tight.  The usual banter between the band and the crowd is replaced by plotline.  This is what makes it work as a 'feature film.'  It is typical Metallica: hare-brained but brilliant.

Unfortunately this bills itself as a movie, even though I've seen more story in a single music video than in this whole thing.  I'm pissed that I just paid to watch a video of a Metallica concert.  I could have watched something similar on youtube for free.  If you watch the preview-that pretty much contains every second of storyline-the rest is all just Metallica playing on stage.",1392076800,3,516,4.446808510638298

6017162,4,B00FPP99MK,"This is a movie in a concert or the opposite could be right also. It's not the first time that we see some music artist brings some fictional story in their music, just think of Led Zeppelin ""The Songs Remains the Same"". The story of the movie that starts in the arena where the band plays, have been conceived by the band's members with the director Nimrod Antal. So it would be natural to see a story that reflects the philosophy of the band related to their music. The actor Dane Dehaan play the role of a roadie that has a mission to find a mysterious suitcase and like it's often the case in a movie, things don't get as planned and the movie looks like a nightmare with some bizarre characters getting in the way of our roadie. The special effects of the movie; explosions, fire, lightening, demolition etc, are about the same special effects we see in the concert itself, so the concert and the movies are intertwined. The songs of the band continue to play even if the movie goes back to the fictional story.

The director has edited the show to 90 minutes, which mean that he had to cut off 4 songs of the set list of the band. The greatest hits are there, a music that has influenced a lot of metal bands in the world and it's always impressive to see Metallica in this huge stage, a bit like U2's stage. All the special effects are there including some Tesla coils that symbolize the lightening. The movie ends with the band playing during the closing credits their beautiful instrumental piece ""Orion"" from Masters of Puppets.

The picture quality is flawless with a decent surround mix.
I know that many movie critics have done their reviews of that movie, but it's still a music concert, so I should also give some stars to the music and the performance.  Let's say that this movie is not going to be appreciated completely by those who don't like the music of Metallica, in my case, I like the music just enough to enjoy the movie.",1392076800,,1946,4.430167597765363
6017163,4,B00FPP99MK,The concert and film footage is very good and I like they blended it together. Very cool idea and done well.

6017164,5,B00FPP99MK,"5 stars because it felt like a live show then a movie and adding the roadie back story was good wish I could have seen more of it but hard to pick and chose.

Don't watch if you are just looking for a movie to watch and you don't know who Metallica is (hard to believe).

As for a Metallica fan I really like it. The live show and the back story of a roadie was great. If I had to pick and chose I would say make 2 discs one for the live show and one for a good short story of the roadie (good acting by the way).

I streamed it so can't really tell you much about DVD. Wished I have seen it in theater because it has that theater feel to it and IMAX (I don't know about 3D) would have been better.

Having a fun night with friends that know and love Metallica I would buy or stream it.",1391990400,,786,3.774390243902439
6017165,2,B00FPP99MK,"I have been listening to Metallica since 1984.  So yes, I am kind of old.
I tried to go see Through the Never in theaters but it left before I ever got a chance.
I waited anxiously for the DVD release and was excited when my Blu-ray preorder arrived from Amazon..
To summarize, my jaw dropped after I finished the movie.  Not because it was wonderful, but because it was so horrible.
Metallica spent over 20 Million to make the movie and it grossed 3.2 Million at the theater.
I wonder if the boys held on to their receipt so they can return ""Through the Never"" and get their money back.
As pointed out by others, nobody knew the lead actor (Dane Dehaan) and no one really knew the director (Nimrod -really?- Antal), unless you knew him from ""Predators"" which was somewhere between decent to good in my book.
So those factors didn't help draw casual Metallica fans to the movie.
None of that really mattered to me when I heard about the movie, but then again if has ""Metallica"" in the title, I'm all in.
 Now for lifelong Metallifans, the bar was set pretty high.
We wanted the loudest, most headbanging Metallica performance ever.  >>Sidenote<< That may be unfair since they are in their 50's now and they're not going to just destroy it like they did on the Damaged Justice Tour in the 80's.
Since this ""Hollywood"" production required the directors/producers to jump through the same organized labor hoops that other Hollywood productions have to, it really affected the mood and feel of the film IMO.
I hope all of those people in the audience were not unionized extras who weren't real Metallica fans.
But in some of the concert scenes they sure looked like they were.  Several times the camera framed a male audience member who looked like a deer in headlights.  The reaction of most any Metallica fan to a video camera would be a visceral YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
I think it was on ""Ride The Lightning"" where 90% of the place seemed to be standing lifeless.
.......This doesn't really happen at a Metallica show

This concert movie looked like a movie ( in a bad way)  and not a video of a concert.
Even some of the band's playing looked staged.  In a couple of scenes, James even looked like he was acting and James could be a blind, armless, zombie and still churn out ""Battery"".

Am I nitpicking?  You bet.  For $20 million dollars, I think they should have been pickier too.

I don't know who advised them on this thing but I think they got it all wrong.

To me the story was an absolute joke.  It made no sense and I am as open minded as anyone when it comes to a storyline/plot.
If I have to scour the internet to figure out what the movie was trying to convey to me then there's a problem.
The only thing truly entertaining on the main movie disc is the end, where the credits are rolling and Metallica plays Orion in the venue sans audience.
See it, to make up your own mind?  Yes, but please buy it used.  I am getting rid of it.  I prefer to watch Metallica's other Blu-Ray offerings when I need a Metallica fix in High Definition.

Even Lars, who for whatever reason has become the target of haters and trolls on the internet, is in top form in this movie (as are the rest of the band).

The bonus features are good, too. If you call yourself a Metallica fan or even a rock music fan in general, you can't go wrong with this movie. I just wish they would have shown what was in the damn box at the end!

6017174,4,B00FPP99MK,"So, Metallica made a concert movie.  It attempted to intertwine a live action story with a show they put on and it's all supposed to culminate in a cool climax.  Being fully honest, the ""movie"" portion of this release was a total miss.  The basic story line could have been very cool but, even though it's not the main focus of this release, ended up not being fleshed out enough to truly satisfy the need for a complete story.  I feel like it tried to be deep without actually being deep.  The action wasn't even good nor was the thriller/suspense portion, again something that with a little dialog and perhaps an extra scene or two of exposition may have helped and changed the vibe completely.  I do understand that the exposition/movie portion is not the point of this release but then why both spending $18 million on it?

Now, that being said, the concert portion of this release kicks a**, straight MetallicA kicking your a** with each song.  The production value is very high and this is a great sounding release.  Lars' hihat isn't overpowering like it normally is live so that is a big plus and the sound is clean and tight.  These guys played very well and the audio isn't clipped or compressed.  The stage show is the ultimate mash up of all their stage shows since the early 80's which is pretty freakin' rad to see as a long time fan.  For this alone I recommend this blu-ray.  The picture is crisp and looks beautiful.

I bought this despite piss poor reviews everywhere I looked and I bought it because I'm a fan.  If you're looking for a deep engaging movie you will be sorely disappointed.  Musically it's spot on and one of the better recorded shows they've released in a good while.  Get it or don't get it, but do know the reviews everywhere are not lying.  PS, the 4 stars is because the sound is so good and the songs truly rocked!  MetallicA",1391558400,,1865,4.464497041420119

I like the setlist (well, I could do away with Fuel, as I don't like that song that much), I like the angles captured, I like the scenes mixed in with the concert. Really good. I like the fact they've favored mostly the old songs (like having 3 songs off Ride the Lightning!!).

I really loved Cunning Stunts. It's one of the best concert videos I've ever owned. I also loved Live: Binge and Purge, but it was not as good as Cunning. Cunning is on the same level, for me, as NIN Live: And All That Could Have Been, which to me, is one of the best, if not best concert films of all time.

Anyway, this was okay. I was not thinking it was going to exceed my expectations and it didn't. They played some good tracks, but it seemed overproduced. They incorporate a side story in between songs and it gets kind of annoying. I would rather have it be  an hour of pure Metallica than an hour and a half with the side story.

If you love Metallica I would suggest renting it first before buying it. It's good to watch once to see what the hoopla is about, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. Time to find my Cunning Stunts DVD's",1391558400,,1046,4.321428571428571

The point great new reinvigorated  band sounding better and heavier than in years but the movie segments were horrible to stuffer  threw-next  time go live only with a 2-3 hour set like the old days like 89-94 and thrash hard like before pre-89.not what you expect some better some worse!!",1391040000,,1197,4.636792452830188
6017245,5,B00FPP99MK,"I reserved this dvd a week before it came out, and was wondering if it would be any good on my home theater set up. To my surprise this is a KICK @$$ Movie. After watching this you realize there is a Metallica fan buried in all of us. The songs vary across the career of this monumental band. A bit of advice, get your copy now. This is gonna be one of those movies/performances that you'll put in your video library, and won't ever get rid of. People will be looking to see who gets it after you die and hoping you put it in your will.",1391040000,2,536,3.9722222222222223
6017246,5,B00FPP99MK,"Fun to watch, especially that it has such a great songs on it..
But why did they cut parts out? Is it just from amazon, or on a DVD as well?
ehh..",1391040000,,146,3.59375
6017247,4,B00FPP99MK,"Metallica did a great job of maximizing the live show in 3D. However, to me, the film part is only a distraction from how great the concert would be if undisturbed by the film. The entire presentation is top notch in video and the audio is soundboard crystal clear. The surround mix is front heavy and so clean it seems flat & not as dimensional as the image. Like others I wish you could watch the concert as a standalone. The film plays like a crazy expensive music video with cool visuals and symbolism, but not much dialogue or plot. For me it's not as worth watching as the 3D concert after the 1st time. I purchased the 3 disc $60 version & found it well worth the price as other versions seemed to be sold out on day 1. Also included are 2 high quality lithographs: 1 of the band members & 1 of the live stage. As well as a bandanna of the live stage like the one on the cover. The one thing I didn't like is the outer box. It does keep all the extras safe & serves as a reminder of the kind of artwork you would get from a double live album, 12.5"" x 12.5"" x 1"". The only problem I have with it is where to store it. In the end, if Amazon sorts out the edition information, I would get the hard to find $35 2 disc 3D edition here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/Metallica-Through-the-Never-3D-Blu-ray/ref=%26%2574%2561g%3d%2562l%2575r%2561y%252d021%252d20?SubscriptionId=AKIAIY4YSQJMFDJATNBA&tag=bluray-021-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00GYVPHHU&ASIN=B00GYVPHHU&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER

6017258,2,B00FPP99MK,"I do like Metallica's music but I guess I thought this was going to be something more....more story-based and it isn't. It came off to me as an overlong and overwrought, senseless music video ~ so what the heck was suppose to be in the bag? That was the only reason I kept watching :(",1390953600,4,284,4.181818181818182
6017259,5,B00FPP99MK,If you are a fan even just a casual one you need to see this! I will definately be adding this to my Metallica collection.. The sound and visuals are just superb... The band pull out all the stops on this one and the story blends in well with the bands spirted performance... This flat out rocks! GET IT!,1390953600,13,304,4.169491525423729
6017260,5,B00FPP99MK,"I am a huge Metallica fan that has every possible CD and DVD/Blu-Ray that Metallica has put out; that I know of.  And still, with seeing and hearing all of these songs live before, whether from other vids, cd's, or going to a show personally, I was blown away!  It definitely breathed new life into the whole concert-movie experience.  I definitely enjoyed it, but I found myself wondering.... what is in the bag?",1390953600,5,413,4.63013698630137
6017261,5,B00FPP99MK,"Nimrod Antal is responsible for directing this production, which integrates the narrative element into the concert. This creates a juxtaposition between a roadie's trip to hell and the show (which setlist consists of Metallica's greatest hits).

Probably the genre that best describes the narrative scenes on the street is 'horror'. And although the scenes are close to technical perfection and make good use of the soundtrack, the narrative of the film can be very ambiguous and chaotic, which can be a little frustrating for the viewer.

The film has many elements that are open to interpretation, which Metallica says were put there so that the viewer could they have their own interpretation of what the symbols used in the film are trying to say.

However, each time the film seems to be about to collapse because of the ambiguity of the plot, the display takes us back to the Metallica concert, where the band continues to rock the audience with palms, yelling and mosh pit.

The amazing performance of the American band makes one wonder if there really was a need to put a narrative element of a film when a movie about them just playing may have been just as dramatic.

And even though the scenes in which DeHaan appears make use of special effects, I can guarantee that the concert scenes make no use of them.",1390953600,3,1318,4.7631578947368425
6017262,5,B00FPP99MK,"I don't listen to or follow Metallica like I use to but ended up buying this on Blu-ray.  Never had a chance to see the IMAX 3D version but the Blu-ray is the best I can do.  Great music and outstanding live footage.  The storyline mixed in was a little confusing but maybe I can make something of it when I watch it again (which I will).  Cranked up the surround sound and it sounded wonderful.  Reminded me of a Metallica concert from many years ago.  If you like Metallica, you should find this entertaining.  To me, it is worth the money just for the live versions of ""One"" and ""Orion"".",1390953600,6,590,4.261261261261262
6017263,5,B00FPP99MK,The story part was mildly entertaining but the music and concert footage was outstanding.  Since I went to see it as a Metallica show I will give it 5 starts for what it was and not take away for what it wasn't.,1390867200,,211,4.023809523809524
6017264,5,B00FPP99MK,Everyone needs to see this!! Blew my mind of how much you can make out of the storyline... You see something different every time.,1390608000,2,130,4.458333333333333
6017265,5,B00FPP99MK,"I saw the movie the last night it was featured in our local IMAX. So glad I did. I watched it a second time in a regular theater. The IMAX was soo much better. Not only the video quality,  but the audio in the IMAX far surpassed the audio in the regular theater. I have a decent 55 inch LED TV and a pretty solid Surround system, So I am pretty stoked about getting a copy. I pre-ordered my copy weeks ago. It is a bummer that they decided not to add a just the concert footage option. I liked the movie and all, but I am buying it for the awesome live footage they shot, not for the side story. Metallica lost money on this movie. They went all out to get the best live footage they could and it shows. They have no doubt overdubbed the audio in the studio, but Im happy about it. The audio quality is some of the best I have heard. Really looking forward to hearing it in Hi Def Master Audio!!!!!!!!!!",1390089600,3,903,4.044692737430168

6017267,4,B00FPP99MK,"Lots of fun and great sound, great shots. Definitely the best shot & mixed Metallica live show to date! James sounded great, felt more of the original James here... nice job!

The ""Movie"" part is really lame. They could have done so much better. Not sure what happened here. Boring main character that you care nothing about. They would have done better to just have amazing visuals rather than a montaged mess of wanna be cinematic watery soup.

Buy it for the fact that you feel like your right on stage with the guys having lots of fun!",1389312000,,539,4.489795918367347
