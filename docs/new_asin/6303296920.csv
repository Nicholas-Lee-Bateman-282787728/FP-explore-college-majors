7981428,5,6303296920,"One of the better movies in the Space Battleship Yamato series. Story and characters are solid, backed with an explosively awesome musical soundtrack. This is the movie where Dessler (Desslock) and Kodai (Wildstar) bridge the enemy gap and become allies. Presented in the original Japanese language with English subtitles only. If you can't deal with that, better stick to Star Blazers only, but you're missing out!",1516060800,2,415,5.303030303030303
7981429,4,6303296920,"When Voyager started releasing the Battleship Yamato movies, back in 2003/2004, I decided to wait until a dubbed version was released and as time went on and technology improved I hoped for an HD version. 14 years later Ive decided it aint coming. I was a child when Star Blazers was broadcast in the United States but that was a long time ago and clearly the interest in the U.S. has waned significantly. Yamato: The New Voyage is nearly 40 years old and shows its age. The other problem (and this is purely speculation) is that Voyager may have the rights to the U.S. market regarding Yamato properties and may not be in the position to produce a high quality version. The news feed on their website had a fairly steady flow of info but hasn't had a new item since August 2014. Yamato 2199 has never had an official U.S. release and the imported Blu-ray discs are ridiculously overpriced.

The New Voyage was a made for TV movie and has made for TV quality animation. By contrast, the next two movies, Be Forever Yamato and Final Yamato, were released in Japanese theaters and have cinematic level animation which look considerably better. This is actually the first of a two parter that concludes in Be Forever. Having defeated the White Comet Empire just a month prior, the Yamato is now faced with a new Enemy, the Dark Nebula Empire. The mission of the Yamato is to reach Iscandar which has spun out of orbit after the destruction of Gamilon. Desler (or Deslock in Star Blazers) is also involved but now fights to defend Starsha of Iscandar.

I have to confess that the transfer here is pretty abysmal. This is about and quick and dirty as it gets and at one point the movie skips in a way that Ive only seen happen with VHS tapes. In other words I suspect they literally pulled this from a VHS tape and kept every flaw. There is a TON of artifacting and animation crud. When ships are moving you can see the dirt on the page as it sweeps across the screen. Despite the ugly transfer the movie still shines in what made the series great, the designs and music. Space Battleship Yamato may have the best music Ive ever heard in any anime outside of Giant Robo. I love the designs of the ships and uniforms. They are all absolutely iconic and bring back a warm fuzzy feeling from my youth. Even with all the flaws I still love the movie because of my feelings towards Star Blazers.

The biggest problem with the series for me is particularly acute in this movie. The Yamato is simply invincible. After Desler and his fleet receive a beatdown from the Dark Nebula Empire and their flagship, the Yamato shows up and mops the floor with the Dark Empire. The Yamato is like Godzilla ripping through everything in its path. Even when the massive space fortress Goruba shows up, Kodai only resists blowing it to bits with the Undulation Gun because he would kill Desler in the process. We certainly see the Yamato get struck and things blow up but no real harm ever occurs. The tension is removed when you know the Yamato can just pull out its Undulation Gun and destroy anything (including entire planets) that threaten harm.",1500249600,3,3124,4.535460992907802

7981431,4,6303296920,"Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage is a made-for-TV movie that comes between the second Space Battleship Yamato television series and Be Forever Yamato (the third Space Battleship Yamato theatrical film).  This story features a brand new enemy, the Black Nebula Empire.

Desler returns to Gamilus and discovers the Black Nebula Empire mining the planet for a mineral they need to continue their conquests.  Desler attacks the mining operation, and during the battle, Gamilus suddenly explodes.  Then, its twin planet Iscandar begins experiencing volcanic eruptions, and the planet leaves its orbit.  Desler calls Earth and the Yamato for help, and the crew of the Yamato must team up with Desler to try to save the remaining inhabitants of Iscandar.

The DVD contains several bonus features.  There are deleted scenes included as a feature.  However, no soundtrack survived for these scenes, so the dialogue only appears as subtitles on the screen, and new music has been added.  You can watch the film with these deleted scenes included, but personally, I think watching the entire film this way would take away from the viewing experience.  There are also art galleries, an interactive mission map, and some text-only features of behind-the-scenes information about this film.

I'm actually rather impressed with the effort that went into compiling the extras for this DVD, since Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage was originally not a theatrical release.  If you're a Yamato fan, you need to see this film in order to understand what's going on in the next theatrical film, Be Forever Yamato.  This DVD should really be in the collection of anyone who considers themselves a fan of Space Battleship Yamato.",1220400000,2,1719,5.184782608695652
7981432,5,6303296920,"One thing I like in Yamato [Star Blazers] is its mechanic designs. In this feature film, there are a lot of scenes in which my favorite Gamilon fleet appears (so 5 stars). The Gamilons face a strong enemy and Yamato [the Argo] comes to their rescue.
""The New Voyage"" and ""Be Forever Yamato"" (in this order) fit between the Series Two and the Series Three of Star Blazers. The development of the relationship between Desslar [Desslok] and Kodai [Wildstar] which turned from enmity to subtle sympathy in the Series Two is the underline of this story.",1036886400,7,548,4.71875
7981433,4,6303296920,"This OAV continues the Yamato saga after the second series (Comet Empire saga).  The animation is up to their usual standards, which is very good, and the script is, for the most part, well-written.  We continue to see the  character development of Kodai (Wildstar), Yuki (Nova) and Desslar  (Desslok), as well as a little more of the Yamato universe.  This video  introduces 2 new characters, trainees Kitano, Tokugawa (Engineer Tokugawa's  [Orion] son - in the Japanese version, the engineer was killed during the  final Comet Empire conflict) and Sakamoto (who looks suspiciously like Sato  [or Conroy] from the first 2 series).  We also get to see Kodai Mamoru  (Alex Wildstar) and good ol' Queen Staasha (Starsha) or Isacandar  and....well, you'll just have to watch  it, won't you...  <g>
All  kidding aside, this is a good video and very enjoyable to watch, and the  soundtrack (if you can find it) isn't bad, either.",949622400,14,924,4.980263157894737
