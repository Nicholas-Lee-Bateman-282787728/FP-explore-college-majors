8424479,3,B004CZZZ2W,"Pickup Alley (1957) feels more like a 60's crime film than anything else. It isn't very good, while the direction and cinematography is fine, it lacks a story. From the start, it turns out to be one long drawn-out chase scene with nothing but cigarette smoking, walking and buying tickets.

There's one good fight scene with Victor Mature against a lot of goons, a car chase scene, but that's it. The end was wholly ridiculous and unfathomable.",1453507200,,444,4.766233766233766
8424480,5,B004CZZZ2W,"A great movie with  great storyline. It is very clean family movie , not like the ones they make now where they unnecessarily indulge in sex and excessive violence. It was the first time that I see Anita Ekberg in such a mature role where she acts a nd shows a lot of talent as a woman who is forced to work for a psychotic drug dealer who uses her to carry some of her cargoes depending upon her graceful ravishing beauty. In this role, she shows a lot of talent without having her beauty exploited as in later role, and that is shown clearly in the scene where the second man in the drug tafficking ring tried to rape her thinking that she is an easy lady only to be shot by her. Victor Mature was greatly convincing as the FBI agent who follows the head of the drug dealing ring McNally ( Howard Trevor), he showed a lot of talent in acting as the stern officer who will stop at nothing to bring this drug dealer down and thus avenge himself fot the killing of his sister at the hand of this drug dealer. Howard trevor was convincing as the psychotic drug dealer who was always successful in smuggling the drugs from Naples in Italy to New York. Another important aspect about this movie is that it clearly shows how bad drug tafficking was compared with the movies nowadays where it is seen as a normal, glamorous thing which is understood in the age of the legalization of weed and marijuana that does nothing but destroy the neural cells of the prefrontal cortex. A great movie that I really enjoyed , particularly the scenes of Piazza Navone and the catacombs. Dr. Hany.",1450828800,,1577,4.363945578231292
8424481,4,B004CZZZ2W,"Hi, This must be a new release as the movie is clear as a bell. Other customers have said they received defective or poor DVD's. This is from Columbia Classics ,letter box with a  pristine black & white transfer. Good but dated crime drama, revisit the 50's,it's fun.",1393372800,4,267,4.5625
8424482,5,B004CZZZ2W,"This is a mid-50s film with some noir elements, and it is precursor to Bond films.  It is about a sadistic international heroin smuggler dueling with a NY cop out to avenge his sister's death at the hands of the smuggler.  They both use a beautiful voluptuous woman as a pawn in a very dangerous chess game.  Don't believe the other reviews.  This film is transferred in 2:35 widescreen, with a rich black and white texture.  It is rock solid and silvery, and exciting and visually stunning from beginning to end.  If you like crime thrillers, don't miss this one.",1370563200,8,564,4.59
8424483,1,B004CZZZ2W,"This one of my nostalgic favourite films and I was delighted when I found it on American Amazon. I read Chuck Snow's review (and added grateful comments) and also Music Man's comments on Robin Summers review (where he does NOT mention any problem), but I thought oh time has passed, a faulty couple of DVD's - what are the chances? THE CHANCES ARE BAD. I watched my DVD last night - lovely B/W scope - and - It froze at exactly the 57' mark and nothing I could do made it work (My copy doesn't have chapters so I couldn't go beyond that 57' point. So...Just be warned...and one last question please - Can I ask if Robin Simmons bought and watched the same Sony/Columbia DVD? I really would like to know whether Chuck/Music Man/Me were just unlucky....Calm now, and many thanks Robin if you do read this I'd love your thoughts.",1334534400,4,826,4.440789473684211
8424484,1,B004CZZZ2W,"This is the first DVD-Rom film classic that has turned out a dissappointment. After the first 50 minutes (Chapter #7) the image either freezes in some players, or becomes electronic confetti for the rest of the flik. A drag. And since I couldn't get to it until 2 months after I purchased it (from the Market Place), I'm stuck. It's a great B-Movie detective yarn from the 50's shown in Anamorphic B&W 2:35 aspect ratio, shot in NY, London, Lisbon and Rome, with a fun cast (in particular, Trevor Howard relishing his ultra villanous role). So, if you buy it, make sure to skip to Chapter #7 before you invest 50 minutes of fun and disappointment sets in! Ouch!

UPDATE: Oct 2012 - Just re-purchased this DVD from Marketplace seller who stated he had purchased it new and had watched it once. Since his price was so reasonable, I took a gamble and it paid off: no more pixillation after the first 57 minutes. So, if you can ascertain that this DVD-Rom is of recent vintage, or has been watched by the seller, go for it. It's a very entertainung old fashioned detective flik.",1324598400,9,1074,4.536082474226804
8424485,3,B004CZZZ2W,"From 1957.  When his sister is murdered, an Interpol agent (Victor Mature) swears vengeance on the drug kingpin (Trevor Howard) responsible for her death.  By chance, he is assigned to do just that!  The pursuit leads to London, Rome, Athens, Paris, and New York where Kingpin Howard finally meets his unexpected but just demise.  Nice international flavor of what is a changed but familiar landscape.  This is a film very much of its era.  A kind of precursor to the yet unborn James Bond franchise with Mature assuming a license to kill on a globe-trotting mission against an evil organization that threatens the values of the west.",1299715200,8,634,4.878504672897196
