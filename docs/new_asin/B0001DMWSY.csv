8010888,3,B0001DMWSY,Old mystery  with several men trying to solve the murder of nasty old millionaire for various reason.  Everyone seems to have a reason for murdering the old man. Entertaining enough but not a best offering.,1487462400,,206,4.857142857142857
8010889,4,B0001DMWSY,"A purposely complicated murder mystery where everyone is a suspect including the two men trying to solve the case!  Everyone looks suspicious, everyone acts suspicious, of motives there are far too many.  People keep popping up with grudges and valid reasons for wanting a vicious old coot (William V. Mong as crazy Uncle Henry Carson) deader than a doornail.  The old geezer is found stabbed.  ""He died instantly....or very nearly so.""  The niece (Irene Ware as Elsa Carson) looks to be the prime suspect when the murder weapon and a disguise are discovered in her room.  Her motive is well known, Uncle Henry didn't want her to marry Jim Landis (Ray Walker), a detective who shows an unreasonable willingness to solve the case and clear his fiance.  Things look mighty bleak when a second murder victim is discovered under the desk.  It's a mouse that detective Landis quickly sticks in his pocket!!!  Who could have killed the poor rodent and why-why-why?  Is it Foot the Butler (E.E. Clive), a scientist who works with poisonous gasses, or Elsa's Aunt (Hedda Hopper), who admits ""I'm a good hater.""  As if that wasn't nearly enough to contend with, they toss in a case of arson for good measure.

Let's just say I stopped guessing early on and just watched the case unfold through a series of interrogations.  It was fascinating and entertaining (I was beginning to think they all did it or else the old geezer stabbed himself in the back just to throw them off).",1432512000,3,1467,4.75098814229249
8010890,3,B0001DMWSY,"It's ok, dark creepy house, spooky happenings and at least you could make fun of what was going on. It's not so bad that you get fed up with it. At least I can say I saw it.",1407024000,,173,3.5789473684210527
8010891,2,B0001DMWSY,"This is one of the dullest movies I have ever seen.  It might be quite useful to a film studies class, as an example of how not to tell a story.  In particular, it tells - endlessly - instead of showing.  Fully two thirds of the running time must be Berton Churchill and Ray Walker standing around in stuffy formal rooms (which look confusingly alike unless you pay attention to the furniture) telling each other what has happened elsewhere.  Walker is a charisma-free zone, and Irene Ware is prim, proper, and entirely boring. You know your cast is in trouble when the most engaging performance is given by Hedda Hopper, who was soon to abandon her acting career so thoroughly that most people were unaware she ever had one.

The unveiling of the chief villain, and the identity of the murderer (these manage to be two different people) have some modest comedy value, if for some reason you are forced to see this; but really, life is too short.

Print quality is a trifle above average for Alpha Video, but that is saying very little.",1313539200,,1036,4.572972972972973
8010892,3,B0001DMWSY,"THE DARK HOUR is a mystery programmer directed by Charles Lamont (he also worked with Abbott & Costello, and did Ma & Pa Kettle and Francis the Talking Mule films).

The story follows a classic format: two detectives investigating the murder of an elderly millionaire are presented with a number of suspects, all of whom have motives for homicide. The movie also diverts from the familiar and expected: the two detectives, one old, one young, work independent of each other and cautiously compare notes. After a second killing occurs, the men decide to join forces to solve the case.

ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Their prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet this product's rareness and an honest price make it a worthwhile purchase.

8010893,3,B0001DMWSY,"It is difficult to judge this film. It is 70 years old, acting and directing methods have changed, the acting may appear to be stiff, it is better than today's talent.",1154044800,,167,4.419354838709677
8010894,5,B0001DMWSY,Charles Lamont as a director is more well known  for his classic comedies and this film is a rare departure for  him from his usual Shirley Temple fare. In this effort he tries to create a suspensful murder mystery and succeeds very well. He does so using almost no stars. He's helped along by a very strong script that kept be guessing to the end and the fact that he clearly had more money to work with than most guys of the film noir era. A top notch job all around.,1148342400,5,469,4.142857142857143
8010895,5,B0001DMWSY,"""Agatha Christie couldn't have come up with a more gripping yarn. Berton Churchill and Irene Ware outdo themselves and do complete justice to their roles. `The Dark Hour's plot is so finely tuned that it baffled me - a veteran mystery aficionado - till the very end.""",1146528000,8,267,4.702127659574468
