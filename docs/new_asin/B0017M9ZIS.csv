8266607,3,B0017M9ZIS,Just an average documentary. Nothing special here and little or no emphasis on the polar bears extinction due to climate change.,1413849600,,128,5.142857142857143
8266608,5,B0017M9ZIS,"THIS DOCUMENTARY COVERS THE THREAT BY GLOBAL WARMING TO POLAR BEARS. IT IS CONCISE AND SAD AS IT IS, FACTUAL. ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT POLAR BEARS SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DVD. IT MAY BE THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL GET TO SEE THEM WITH GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTING THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE.",1353369600,2,311,4.571428571428571
