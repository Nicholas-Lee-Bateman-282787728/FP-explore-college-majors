6373779,5,B00JKTFQH4,"I grew up watching this series in the 1970s as a kid in S. Ca. There are quite a few episodes I recall the most and they are on this wonderful set. ""Living Doll"" is perhaps my favorite one of all in this original series hosted by veteran TV writer Rod Serling. If ""Chucky"" ever knew of his long lost sister named ""Talking Tina"", he would be envious!!! lol  He also did a series after this one called ""Night Gallery"". Pretty much the same premises, but updated from the '60s black and white to 1970s color.
This set is well done, but for those that have the entire series or the one called ""Fan Favorites"" you might want to look at the episodes to see if it is really worth your money on this. Obviously, if you have the entire series, you won't need this set. It is nicely packaged, with two DVDs housed on one side one over the other. Reversible graphics inside casing.

Episodes Include ~
""Walking Distance"", ""Time Enough At Last"", ""The Hitch-hiker"", ""The Monsters are Due on Maple Street"", ""A Stop at Willoughby"", ""The After Hours"",
""The Howling Man"", ""The Eye of the Beholder"", ""Nick of Time"", ""The Invaders"", ""The Obsolete Man"", ""It's A Good Life"", ""The Midnight Sun"", ""To Serve Man"", ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"", ""Living Doll"", ""The Masks"".

~ Look for William Shatner before his Star Trek Captain days in the ""Nightmare"" and ""Nick of Time"" episodes. Exceptional!
~ Burgess Meredith from ""Foul Play"", ""Burnt Offerings"", ""Clash of the Titans"" ('81), ""Rocky"" movies plays a ""die hard"" reader in ""Time Enough At Last"".
~ Agnes Moorehead who plays the motherly witch in the TV series ""Bewitched"", stars in ""The Invaders"".

I think you all will love this series as it is. There is no political correctness, swearing, or sexual innuendos to contend with. A good storyline and characters is what Rod wrote and is famous for. Highly recommended!!",1424649600,25,1843,4.679012345679013

8651970,5,B00JKTFQH4,"The Twilight Zone: Essential Episodes is a great cross-section of some of the more memorable T-Zone episodes. The Twilight Zone featured outstanding stories by the likes of Rod Serling, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont and others. The supernatural themes, the creepy music and great acting created one of the greatest sci-fi shows ever. A number of fine actors and actresses launched their careers in this show, such as Burgess Meredith, William Shatner, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Lee Marvin, to name a few. Some of my favorite episodes in this collection are Time Enough at Last, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, To Serve Man, The Howling Man, The Eye of the Beholder, Living Doll and The Obsolete Man. The Twilight Zone was a masterpiece of chilling stories and remains timeless entertainment for fans of the genre.",1487635200,,847,5.189781021897811

8651972,4,B00JKTFQH4,"Some of MY essentials, e.g., ""The Obsolete Man,"" ""Terror at 20,000 Feet,"" and ""The Howling Man,"" were included.  I wish that a few others, such as the one with Howard Duff who confuses his life on a sound stage with the real thing and the one with Richard Long's multiple roles in a society where everyone must undergo the plastic surgeon's knife, could have been featured.  But I'm happy with my selection as ""Essentials"" fulfills my desire to view some of my favorite episodes.",1485043200,7,479,4.690476190476191
