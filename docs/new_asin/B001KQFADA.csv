8344492,4,B001KQFADA,"it started off really amazing with the song It's Rocking, Kareena Kapoor was looking so beautiful & her dresses were fabulous.
The story of the film is really old I knew the ending half way though the film but the cinematography was excellent. The songs are terrific composed by one of my favourite music composers Pritam. Every song is good and I like the remix version of the song Miss you everyday better than the original. Tusshar & Kareena were the best, Ayesha Takia was OK.",1301270400,,480,4.593023255813954
