2430836,3,B000BO0LFY,"I remember when this was first broadcast on TV, back in 1990. I was too young to see it but I always wanted to, since even back then I knew I was gay. When I heard it was coming out on DVD, I jumped at the chance to see it for the first time. And now that I have, I can finally tell you that it's...okay. Granted this was 1990, so I wasn't expecting anything truly deep or daring from this, but watching it, I couldn't help but notice how quaint and careful and well, clinical the whole thing was. The story is basically about a young gay couple, one of whom is played by a young Hugh Grant, trying in vain to sound like an American, even though his mother is played by Julie Andrews. Grant's lover is dying of AIDS and wants to reconcile with his estranged mother (played by a slightly over-the-top Ann Margaret in a blond wig) before he dies. So Grant sends his mother (Andrews) to Arkansas to try and convince his lover's mother, who hasn't seen her son in years to come and see her son. Naturally, being an ignorant woman, she refuses. (There's a high camp moment when Andrews slaps Ann Margaret and calls her a stupid b****.) And so the bulk of the film is about her coming to terms with what she has tried to ignore for years and make peace with her son. The film isn't terrible but it tries so hard to be safe that the inevitable and much needed emotional climax never really comes, at least not in a satisfactory way. The ending is completely rushed and leaves the viewer feeling cheated. But in the end, the film is a product of it's time, so you can't be too harsh towards it. For six bucks, you could do a lot worse, and the curious won't feel too disappointed.",1139961600,24,1672,4.228125
2430837,5,B000BO0LFY,"I have seen this on dish TV a few times now and liked it.  This was an emotionally wrenching story about two sons both gay.  The parents could not be more different.  One is better off fanancially and very cosmopolitan more liberal and accepting.  The other son has parents that are more working class country stock from a more conservative traditional closed minded background.

The sons fall in love and one contraversy after another ensues.  I do not want to reveal the nature of the issues raised but let me just say the fur flies as a result. The acting in Our Son's is very beleivable.  The focus is on the two mothers and how differently they respond to the events in their respective sons lives.  Ends up both parents and others involved in the lives of the two son's have a lot of growing up to do.  Everyone touched by the choices the sons make is left profoundly changed. Only you can say if it if is for the better.  Take a look at the DVD, it is pretty good.  The ending is pretty happy and arrived at only after hard work on the parts of all conserned.  Alas it is sort of bitter sweet in the end.

The DVD is worth it.  This is a must have DVD in my collection and I think you will like it too.",1134172800,15,1209,4.177489177489178
2430838,5,B000BO0LFY,"Wow - this TV movie has it all -  I am so excited to see it released on DVD (and for such an amazing price!).  This film is so awesome - it should be seen by EVERYONE.  It can truly make a difference in their lives.  It deals with a son who has AIDS and his Mother who he has not spoken to in years.  Actors are top notch (""Dame"" Julie Andrews, Ann Margaret & Hugh Grant!).  My gratitude to anyone & everyone who worked on this film.",1132012800,21,433,3.8636363636363638
2430847,5,B000BO0LFY,Touching movies 2 moms each loving their sons finding each other going thru a time with their sons together.,1411171200,,108,4.7368421052631575
2430848,3,B000BO0LFY,I found this movie rather bland even though the material and subject lent itself to much more exploration of the human relationships.  In saying that I thought all 4 principal actors did their best with the scripts provided.  JA and AM never disappoint.,1376092800,,253,4.8604651162790695
2430849,5,B000BO0LFY,"This movie is so well done in every way that I can't begin to express myself about it.  Julie Andrews is, of course, her usual prissy self but it is appropriate here. When she takes a limo to the trailer park in Arkansas it is just such a wake up call for her that it's funny and heart breaking at the same time.  Hugh Grant is gorgeous in all his youthful beauty and Anne Margaret looks surprisingly well. She does a fantastic job in the role.  I won't give away the story but I think that anyone with any heart at all would love this movie.",1372464000,,542,4.09433962264151
2430850,3,B000BO0LFY,"I bought this DVD hoping to enjoy Julie Andrews. (I've been a fan of hers for a long time.) The story depicts each character's struggle and does so nicely, but something was missing for grabbing my full interest.",1369699200,,212,4.605263157894737

2430853,4,B000BO0LFY,This is a good movie and appropriate for these times. Anne Margret and Julie Andrews do a great job of portraying mothers of sons who seem confused a bit but are still loyal to each other.,1298764800,4,188,4.25
2430854,5,B000BO0LFY,"Let me just say that Ann Margret plays the trailer trash Mom of a dying son to perfection. Almost too good to the point that it runs dangerously close to high camp. I always liked her, after watching this I became a fan. Great movie !",1283212800,5,234,4.108695652173913

Ann Margret is also very good in it.  GREAT movie to watch...stands by her son no matter what.",1260403200,6,342,3.9705882352941178
