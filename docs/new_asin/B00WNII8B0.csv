7143022,4,B00WNII8B0,"Great performance. I just wish that concert video producers would chill out. Why so many cuts? When I go to a concert, I let my eye settle on a performer for whole stretches of time -- especially during solos! (For example, the camera should never have left Chris Squire during his amazing solo at the beginning of Heart of the Sunrise.) Why does the camera have to jump from player to player so often and so frenetically? Over and over again, the camera arrives late and leaves early. And why? Here's my advice to concert video producers: Take a look at audience recordings on YouTube to get a sense of what audiences are looking at. And emulate that.",1437868800,,652,4.533898305084746
7143023,4,B00WNII8B0,"This is the suite of the Yes live at the Bristol Hippodrome of last year, recorded this time in Arizona, August 2014. It represents something special, because it's the last Chris Squire presence on a DVD release. They could have put those two shows on 1 Blu-Ray since it's only 1 hour and a half each show, or at least gives us a complete concert with the encore. The visuals have more importance on this one than on the previous DVD that had a poor light show. The camera angles gives us a better view of the whole stage. In the 5 first minutes of ""Close to the Edge"", the video and the audio are not synced up correctly for a few seconds. But the stereo mix is fine with each instruments clearly heard. I can't help myself to have a closer look at Chris Squire who was looking like at any other shows with his finger and leg in the air, and thinking that there's no justice when someone is hit by a disease that led him to the inevitable in only one month. I surprised myself enjoying again the song ""Roundabout"" again after so many years with the unique Steve Howe guitar sound that i always enjoy. In the song ""Cans and Brahms"", Downes has to put his glasses on to read the notes. After the two shorts songs, ""South Side of the Sky"" that the band brought back about ten years ago is that nice little epic song that display some piano lines that could be perceive like a metaphor for someone climbing a mountain. i forgot about that little instrumental piece ""5% for Nothing"" that doesn't sound like Yes. It is in fact a Billl Bruford contribution and a joke on the music business. And how appropriate to see near the end of the show the song ""Fish"" with the unique solo and huge bass sound of Squire. I could not imagine Billy Sherwood replicate this in the future. For me this is a more enjoyable release than the Bristol show, and i am sure that many Yes fans will want this to complete their collection",1436918400,2,1909,4.305555555555555
7143024,3,B00WNII8B0,"Have to agree with concerned dad.  First thing is this Blu ray being stereo only, it immediately gets 1 star off.  This is 2015 and on Blu ray, there is no reason for it not to be in at least Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  If your only playing this through your TV speakers then you probably won't mind.  But if you have 2.1, 5.1 or better though a separate system, I think you will be disappointed.  Thank goodness my AV Receiver has a Theater Setting that added to the sound that was lacking any energy at all.  Speaking of energy, although most of the music was performed with precision and pretty much as I remember them from albums and previous concerts, age definitely has effected the energy of this concert.  I certainly can relate, as I am getting up in years, and things just don't do what they used to.  They are moments where Steve, Geoff and Chris shine, but mostly they seem to be just playing another concert and going through the motions. And Alan White seems to be in agony most of the time.  1 star off.  As much as I want to like Jon Davison, he doesn't really add anything to Yes.  He's there, he is singing, it's not bad, but he seems to be in the background, even though he is front and center.  1 star off.  The video is crisp and clear and it is mostly in sync.  There are a couple of spots the music and performances don't match up, but not anything distracting.  And finally I am adding 1 star for Chris Squire.  This obviously will be the last concert video he will be in, and I paid a lot more attention to the bass player then I usually do.  If I could I would add 1/2 star, since Yes was and still is one of my favorite groups since the early 70's.",1436832000,4,1673,4.178125
7143025,3,B00WNII8B0,"The blu ray I received is in stereo only. No surround.  It is 2015 right? Three stars only because of that. Besides,  the energy left this band somewhere over Phoenix.  Sorry.",1436745600,4,175,4.580645161290323
7143026,5,B00WNII8B0,"I was at this concert, and it has since increased in significance as this was the last time I was able to see Chris Squire perform live.  As such, I consider myself privileged to have a video of the performance.  The Mesa Art Center is really a wonderful venue.  The acoustics are perfect, the seats comfortable, and the sound system is top notch.  This BluRay captured the concert quite well.  The sound is crystal clear, and unlike many live recordings, each instrument and vocal is well mixed, and easily identified and audible.

The cinematography was also well done.  A nice mix of sweeping zooms into the performers, many long shots of the stage and screens, not too many audience shots, and just the right amount of cuts from one camera to the next.  Some concerts videos are way too busy, but this director clearly knew his job.

On the down side, there were a few places that seems as though the sound and video were not quite sync'ed up correctly, and they totally overdub'd the part where Jon Anderson missed a note in Close to the Edge.  The video did not include the encores either, which was mildly disappointing.  Overall, however, I am extremely pleased with the quality of this BluRay, the sound, and the production.  I have the DVD/CD on order as well, so I can listen to it without having to sit in front of my TV.",1436572800,8,1333,4.531380753138075
7143027,5,B00WNII8B0,"What a great show!  I was there, so perhaps I'm biased, but the boys were in good form, and this disc both sounds and looks great.  The fact that Chris Squire is now gone makes this show even more poignant, since he can't have had too many more shows after this one and before his untimely passing.  I'm glad I was able to see him one last time.

It's a shame they didn't also include the fantastic opener, Syd Arthur, on the disc.

Y'all can grouse all you want over who happens to be in the band this time around, but as someone already said, this is YES, like it is, today, and they sound great.  The continually shifting lineup is one of the things that keep them fresh.

By the way, I can confirm that this is a region ""0"" disc (NTSC), playable in all NTSC players.  It is not, as some product descriptions say, a Japanese region 2 disc.",1436572800,11,842,4.186335403726708
7143028,5,B00WNII8B0,"Oh, you guys (yeah - Im assuming were mostly guys) - haven't you figured it out yet?  The band is on to you:  THEY are the ones who decide what is YES, not you!

The performances are exquisite; the sound is perfect; the video production is astounding.

Steve Howe is 70 years old and still going strong - its hard to believe his fingers didn't just lock up and fall off years ago.  Geoff Downes is an amazing multi-keyboardist - HE IS:  deal with it! (Also, he's aware of your overblown expectations of him - he just doesn't care!).  Alan White may not be the manic inspiration for the Muppets Animal that he used to be, but hes still here laying down the backbone of this awe-inspiring music.  Jon Davison has inserted himself seamlessly into the fabric of YES - you can see that he feels the power of the pieces he is performing, and no doubt knows the the size of the shoes he fills.

And Chris. . .  Mr. Squire revels in the Chris Squireness of it all.  He was here from the beginning and hes here at the end. . .  yeah, I know:  at what point, due to attrition, does this band transition from being YES to being a YES tribute band?  I say NOT YET.""

This is not YES like it was; this is not YES like you want it to be; this is YES the way THEY say it is:

this is YES Like It Is.",1436572800,31,1284,4.035714285714286
7143029,4,B00WNII8B0,"YES displays a great performance revisiting the Close To The Edge and Fragile albums in their entirety. The image is awesome. The sound (which was mixed by Billy Sherwood) is fantastic. This is a great show and I think all YES fans will enjoy it very much as we continue to bid our farewell to Chris Squier. Rest in peace Chris. Thank you for the music.

7143030,5,B00WNII8B0,"I was there and Yes put on one heckuva show that night.  Syd Arthur was their opening and they were good.  It was my first time at the Mesa Arts Center and we sat in the upper level, just above the cameras.  You'll like this one.  I'm giving it 5 stars just because it was a great show, I hope the DVD doesn't disappoint.",1434240000,7,321,3.96875

7143071,3,B00WNII8B0,"I saw these guys in Boston a month or so earlier and they had much more energy than they do here in Arizona.  The songs drag a bit and the arrangements/execution seem quite a bit more bare - perhaps they are worn out from touring by the time they got to this performance.  The camera work is unstable throughout alothough the clarity is very nice - in fact almost too nice as you can see how old and ugly these relics are (said with all due admiration and respect).
I don't know why encores are left out - it's just Close to the Edge and Fragile.  In Boston they did ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" and a rendition of ""Startship Trooper"" that was really awesome and well executed with Chris doing his usual antics during ""Wurm""...and Chris...if he hadn't died I might have rated this even lower, but this vid provides a last welcome glimpse of this genius less than a year before his death.  I'd say this is for hardcore fans desiring a final experience with Chris and willing to watch without John Anderson.  There are better Yes videos out there.",1438214400,5,1042,4.40625
