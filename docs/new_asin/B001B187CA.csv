8281284,5,B001B187CA,My 4 yr old grandson loves the dinosaur king he watches it on netflix and now he can watch it on his dvd player when we are on the road and do not have wifi hookup.  It makes things easier on the adults in the car and keeps him busy.  So it is a winner all around.,1470700800,,264,3.6140350877192984

8281288,4,B001B187CA,As for the DVD my son loves it... I wish I could stream it free on Prime. We received it in Amazon's promised time (I love Amazon) and there was no card in the case...I contact customer service and they very quickly sent a replacement that also did not include a card ...I read the packaging hoping there was a code to send in or an address to claim the card and there is not one...,1390435200,,382,4.0394736842105265
