4174073,3,B003R0MF7G,"I have been watching this show since I was a young teen and it has definitelly played a part in my life. But I am starting for feel like the show has moved away from Tree Hill and more into a stupid Soap Opera about people getting laid and partying it up. I feel like all the life experiences that are true to life have been taken out of it. I also feel like the cast changes so much that it has lost its appeal. Nobody really cares about the lifestyles of the new cast, all they care about are the old familiar faces. What happened to Karen? What happened after Lucas and Peyton left home? What does their child and Lucas's sister Lily look like? What about Skills and Mouth and a lot of the other people who made the story great. Is Dan dead yet? What about Debora? I just think that this show needs to look back at the old cast who made the show so amazing, and the town and the team of Ravens that made it special. Its gotten to be more about the fame and fortune of the characters than what they used to stand for. What happened to the record store owner? (can't remember his name). I want the OLD Tree Hill back!",1306454400,28,1118,4.086363636363636
4174074,3,B003R0MF7G,"This season is not the best for Nathan/Haley. The shows most popular couple is relegated to the background which is a great shame since they have been the show's rock and heart since S1.

Bethany Joy Galeotti (Haley James Scott) continues to be a bright spot, even in a reduced role (Haley doesn't have any major storylines, which is understandable as Bethany herself was pregnant in real life).

This is the season that Brooke Davis (Sophia Bush) gets the baby and the boy, just a pity it had to be at the expense of everyone else getting focus.

It's also very palpable the writers have no idea what to do with Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) taking his dream away and having him become an agent and attend college. A thoroughly tedious storyline.

Storylines with Chase, Chuck, Jamie ect are a waste of time, since it's obvious by now that most people tuning in do so for the core charactets (Nathan, Haley and Brooke) and everything else is just filler. Clay/Quinn continue to be boring together. Quinn does her best work in scenes with Bethany (who plays her sister Haley). The Nathan/Clay bromance is too much at times, making Nathan seem OOC...crying in a horse field? Haley also plays too often the role of prop for Brooke. The writers need to find more balance in their friendship scenes.

The season is just ok, nothing special, but nothing terribly offensive either. Though this season more than ever, it becomes more and more clear that One Tree Hill has reached its end.",1306108800,8,1481,4.702702702702703
4174075,5,B003R0MF7G,"I have been through every step of every show for eight seasons of One Tree Hill. I have seen people come and go in this show, all doing great jobs. If this does happen to be the show finale, it was done with great care. The full circle for everyone was superb. I hate to see it end, but they have run the course with greatness. Mark Schwann created a masterpiece.",1305676800,2,363,4.126760563380282
4174076,5,B003R0MF7G,Loved` the season ! All of the seasons` were good. I think theres` something missing without Peyton and Lucas they should come back for next season because the next will probally be there last !  Love Quinn! Alex! Clay; Why is Chase leaveing I mean him and Alex are really good together like a Brooke and Chase ! Alex is a Brooke! Love all of the cast ! I mean Chases` Ex GF was liked` eariler on but I find her not very inportant besides her amazeing singing carrer !,1305417600,,468,4.2
4174077,5,B003R0MF7G,"Hi,

When is ""One Tree Hill Season 8"" going to be released on DVD? I am from Australia and that's the only way I can watch it, (although I have since found out that I cannot purchase each episode anyway because I'm in Australia) WHAT THE..... I have watched every episode from season 1 to 7 with my family and feel it unfair if I can only purchase one episode at a time to watch on my personal Computer so the rest of the family miss out, and it's unfair if they have to purchase it again to watch it on each one's own's computer.",1298160000,6,530,4.0476190476190474
4174078,5,B003R0MF7G,I love that episodes are available online ... I missed this episode so it was great being able to watch just this one!,1295308800,,118,4.173913043478261
4174079,1,B003R0MF7G,I have been buying a lot of one tree hill episodes and gossip girl episodes and lately they take forever to load if they even load and this one won't even open up.  If they do start to play they skip and it takes the show about 15 minutes or longer to play then it says. Updated my flash player and everything. Very upsetting :(,1291334400,,328,4.046153846153846
4174080,4,B003R0MF7G,"Though we are still in season 8's episodes I would say it has the ability to be great.
While the story lacks in some areas, the overall arc of the series is making an effort to get across certain messages.
While it is uncertain what those messages are at this time, the ultimate goal I believe is to wrap up the series, and allow the characters to have their happy endings.
I personally love happy endings, and love happy characters in general, BUT this writing has made me question that. It seems to be cutting short issues it could be addressing.

It seems to make me want drama, and more excitement in the series again. It is lacking the qualities we love about the show. So while I love the series and this season, I am thinking it could be better. Time will tell whether that is right or not.

------UPDATE-------

As of 8.11's episode of OTH, the series has captured many fans again with the establishment of more drama.
Furthermore the series regained it's original fans that were lost by the exit of Lucas and Peyton. Many fans are continuing watching the series for
Brooke & Julian. So while I don't retract my review, I will say that s8 is getting much better.",1290038400,4,1170,4.457943925233645

4174301,5,B003R0MF7G,"I am an avid One Tree Hill watcher. I watched it quite frequent whend it was on t_v, but when it was on tv it was so hard to watch it the times that came on. I've had seasons 1 through 5 for quite some time and needed to get the others. I watched them completely through all seasons, 1 through 9, episode after episode during my free time. I absolutely love this show and it's 1 of the best, if not the best series that I've ever seen. Once I got through this season that I had at home, I needed to get the season that I didn't have. I knew it was going to be hard to find them in a store, or that if I did find them they were going to be more than I wanted to spend. I then  decided to look on Amazon and I found what I needed and I found them at a very reasonable price. I place my order and the items came very very quick. I'm very glad I chose to get them on here rather than having to go to a store, look for the items I needed, and hopefully not spending a fortune. If you're looking to get the last few seasons, you'll definitely be happy with the delivery time and the price.",1420675200,,1083,3.8133333333333335

4174473,5,B003R0MF7G,"I lived in Wilmington, NC, where One Tree Hill was filmed, and I was fortunate to get an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at what made the show so special.

First, the production value was tremendous. You have never seen a group of people so meticulous in their craft. Every scene had to have exactly the right lighting, and every nano-nugget of dialogue had to be repeated thousands of times until the nuance was just... perfect, so that when Peyton said ""why hello,"" you knew she meant it, and it struck you on some primal level.

I also overheard some of the discussions in the writers' room. It was phenomenal, like being in a beehive of genius, where every little writer bee would cross-pollinate the ideas of the others, and they would work relentlessly all in the service of the Queen. You. You are the queen. The 12-18-y-o girls who watch One Tree Hill are the queen, the honey to their comb. I've seen some of the writer bees at home with their wives and, seriously, all they can think about is you. It's kind of creepy. (Needless to say, this makes the wives a little fidgety, but they put up with it because they know it's only 9 seasons.)

Just to paint the writers' room for you, one writer bee would say something like, ""How about `oh but Lucas, you are the sun to my stars'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Are you kidding? 12-18-y-o girls don't go for that. They want real dialogue, not cheesy bedtime fairytales. How about `oh but Lucas, you know I won't go for that--I'm a tough, modern gal who can buy her own iPods'?"" and another writer bee would fire back, ""Gal? Really? Is this the 19th Century?"" And so on.

I wish you could have seen the way the crew operated on set. Utter professionals. None of them were blessed with movie star good-looks - most of them had a saggy gut and were balding, and for some odd reason they were almost always carrying a half-peeled Snickers Bar - but you've never seen a group of guys so in tune with the modern young-female psyche. Even during their off hours, you'd find them reading pre-teen fashion blogs, trying to understand you, your essence. Such devotion to craft.

One time - and I think this says it all - I walked in on the ""testing"" room, where they had a small horde of young females stationed in front of a TV and hooked up to galvanic skin response sensors. The crew would present various scenarios on the TV - Chad Michael Murray with a varsity jacket, Chad Michael Murray without a varsity jacket; Rape scene in a basement, Rape scene at the prom - and then they'd scientifically analyze the results from the skin sensors to determine which permutations elicited the highest physiological arousal. The whole point, you see, was to maximize arousal, to make you as lustful or as disturbed as possible. And what really made One Tree Hill unique was the professionalism and dedication, the almost clinical way in which they went about their business. It's why the show will go down in the pantheon of not just the greatest shows ever, but of the greatest artistic productions period. Customer is queen!",1341100800,,3081,4.574275362318841

4174479,5,B003R0MF7G,"Review: even though there are hundreds of television shows that triggers the audience every hour and minute One Tree Hill is an outstanding show, because there are steady characters, fantastic actors and the whole family can watch and enjoy the unraveling and upbeat moments of a superior production.

One Tree Hill has numerous age groups throughout the series. The show airs six days a week. On weekdays it's on from 1:00p.m. to 3:00p.m. and starts at 7:00a.m on Saturdays, which is shown on soapnet. Characters are Bethany Joy Lenz as Haley James Scott, Sophia Bush as Brook Davis, James Lafferty as Nathan Scott, and many more.

I never watched soapnet, but one day I was scrolling through channels and caught a glimpse of  One Tree Hill during ""Breakfast in bed"" and become instantly hooked. In 2009, I became addicted and have been watching every episode since.

The actors are phenomenal and continue to surprise me with qualities their characters show that you've never seen before. By watching the hard workers during their performance, nothing but talent shines through the screen.

Not only are they great characters, there is never a replacement character. Throughout nine complete seasons there are consistent actors. If there is ever a time were the characters quite or leave there are brand new names that have separate personality and features.

If you currently have children and you're flipping through channels and want to watch a show that the entire family can enjoy. One Tree Hill is the one. The ratings are PG-13, there is a minimum of sexual activity and vaguer language. It's filled with dram and violence without the access fat.

Being so obsessed is not likely for me, but this is a television show that I will miss dearly. This is the final season that One Tree Hill airs new episodes. After an amazing run on television network One Tree Hill is coming to an end. Fortunately, it's not over yet!

You can either buy the complete series or watch reruns on TV. If you have ever seen One Tree Hill, just waiting on satellite will be nerve racking. If you're someone who enjoys romantic scenes, family time means a lot to you, and you value friendship, this is the TV-series for you.",1333497600,,2208,4.822751322751323

4174497,2,B003R0MF7G,"As a former die hard fan, I miss the old characters that are gone, not just Lucas and Peyton, but also Whitey and Keith. Season seven was pretty terrible, minus a moment here or there, but season eight is better, just barely. The Psycho Katie story is wrapped up in a wonderful episode. The season definitely lacked fan favorite Dan Scott. Would have been nice to see the lovable Grubbs again. Chase becomes a series regular with Alex and Mia fighting for his affection. He's fine, but what is with all the focus on Chuck? Kid's a bit of a pain and too much wasted time and storylines. The Brucas wedding was a lovely episode which did make me choke up a bit. Brooke has grown up, and she loses her clothing line, unfortunately, and becomes a bit of a dull storyline. Naley are still cheesy- miss their old days, and Haley gives birth to Lydia. There was a wonderful potential with Nathan's professor's son, who seemed like he could have been Nathan 2.0 aka from jerk to decent guy, until we find out his dark secret. All in all, unless you're a diehard Naley or Brooke fan, nothing too special in this season, again.",1326844800,,1117,4.453658536585366

4174511,5,B003R0MF7G,"Season GrEight of OTH is filled with bittersweet moments and feel good episodes for the most part and contains the single greatest midseason finale of the show's entire run.
  Throughout the season it becomes very obvious that Mark Schwahn [the show's creator and mastermind] intended this to be a perfectly sweet and emotional goodbye, a season for the fans. Haley and Nathan have another baby while B. Davis finally gets her fairy tale wedding and her biggest wish of all fulfilled. And while many scenes are way corny (maybe more than ever), season 8 is still one of the best ones. Whether B. Davis and rest of the gang put their fight face on on Thanksgiving, the girls dress up as superheroes to tell off some stuck up bullies or experience a morning after ""The Hangover"" style, it never gets boring in good ol' Tree Hill.
  Now, with another (shorter) 9th and final season (for real, this time...), Schwahn set out to make this one for himself, with wild story lines and the return of familiar faces (cue CMM minus Hilarie Burton, amongst others). And while OTH fans have been faced with the possibility of a series finale year after year since about season 4, it still is a little heavy on the heart to say ""fare thee well"" to these beloved characters. So prepare your goodbyes and tune in when the show kicks off its final 13 episodes, January 11 on The CW.",1325635200,3,1365,4.581967213114754

4174518,5,B003R0MF7G,"I don't agree that the show has gone into a ""just sex"" mode - there was definitely a lot more when the main characters were in high school.  I agree that Haley & Nathen are so fantastic together, but I like to see Nathen fully grown up & going to college.  They will always be a totally solid couple.  I DO miss the other characters & wish we could see more (or any) of them!  Karen!  But I guess when an actor wants to leave there is not much the show can do about it.  I am glad that through all the heartbreak, Brooke finally found her joy & don't begrudge her her ""time in the sun"".  I love to see stories with Jamie too - it sets the scene for the ""next generation"" - I would like to fast forward & see him playing a Raven's sport.  That last scene with him dribbling the basketball over the bridge was so reminiscent of his uncle that I wanted to cry - it was perfect.  I'd like to see him in high school dating Madison while his Mom run's Karen's.  I do miss Lucas & Peyton, but I don't think (from what I hear & I could be wrong) that CMM is a very nice guy.  I do think season #8 was their last season, but I'll watch as long as they're on.",1315872000,10,1149,3.9094827586206895

8402910,3,B003R0MF7G,"Customers should not have to buy additional items to stream movies and shows purchased on Amazon.  It is a financial burden for me to have to purchase a fire stick made by Amazon even though I have a Chromecast that works great.  I think it is outrageous to force customers to buy your product because you can, if they want to be able to stream.  I am very dissatisfied with the purchase of my very favorite tv series because i am limited to watching it on my ipad.  All because I purchased through Amazon. I bought 2 seasons from VUDU and that app gives me no trouble streaming to Chromecast. However the price per season was cheaper on Amazon.  Who wants to watch shows on a small iPad when I have a very nice tv.  I feel that if customers are purchasing through Amazon then Amazon shouldnt make life so difficult! Not everyone wants an Amazon Fire stick.  I certainly DO NOT want Alexia or and voice control feature in my home. There again Amazon is forcing customers a feature they may not want because you cant just get a Fire Stick with a regular remote.  My Chromecast functions just fine and it would be great if Amazon would stop trying to control customers and allow content to be streamed on any device!!  Im spending my hard earned money to Amazon then I should be able to watch the shows/ movies on any device I want, including streaming through Chromecast!!!!",1515196800,,1373,4.46
8402911,1,B003R0MF7G,I took the plastic wrap off of this dvd and noticed the paper cover had a 2 inch gash cut through it and it cut all the way through the plastic cover of the DVD case. I didn't use a knife or box cutter or anything sharp when I opened the big box it came in and opened the plastic wrap on the side not even close to this tear. Wtf. This is just ridiculous and unfair. I paid over $20 for a product. It should have been perfect!,1507334400,,426,3.797752808988764
