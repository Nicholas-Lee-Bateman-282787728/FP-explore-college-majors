3002397,5,B000XFVINK,"This movie is amazing. Very well done.  It has a parallel story of the Guadalupe miracle and a modern day drama. The drama is about a family searching for archeological evidence about the miracle out of professional curiosity, for the brother and his sister are both archeologist from Spain; at the same time a drama unfolds their deepest childhood wounds which have turned this character into a cold husband and father. In a parallel manner, an ancient writer tells the miracle of Guadalupe allowing you to see it unfold your very eyes. The actress that plays Guadalupe is very young reminding the believer that she was only 16 when she had Jesus.",1198886400,28,648,4.785714285714286

This movie is a well-made, engaging story of deep human responses to the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe with outstanding actors and actresses. You will become drawn into the drama of the human experience, and that's the strength of this movie. I highly recommend it for family viewing, as it tells the story of people who find inspiration and strength in the miracle. I am not a native speaker of Spanish, but the English subtitles were just fine for me. This is a refreshing alternative to the trash that's on TV. Watch it with your teenagers and see them become engaged in this lovely story of faith and devotion.",1357257600,2,848,4.66

3002431,5,B000XFVINK,"I watched this movie last night on Univision missed the first 15minute Im not sure  if that would of made a great difference but from where I started to see it, its like they were trying to get at something but it never realized its potential, the modern drama that was trying to unfold was dry & way to underdeveloped to mean anything, you really don't connect with the actors so I took it with grain of salt ,it felt like two different movies woven into each other the first was super wack I would not have spent a penny on that particular plot whoever payed for this waisted his/her money , the PASSION OF CHRIST only comes along once in a great while,where the Director was able to add to the events to get a real feel of Christ's Humanity outside of the Scriptures & the love Mother Mary had for her son the promised Messiah & the pain & connection any mother has when her child is in trouble well done!!!! ,But in Guadalupe  you don't need to add to this great event in History to make it better you need to keep it real to the events thiers so much to these apparitions without all the modern day storylines if your going to add make it worth it ,so why the 5 stars ???? the second part  was the actual story of Juan Diego & Our Lady it was beautiful,it had a real feel to it took me back in time to 1531 & what it might have been like when Our Lady speaking in Nahuatl the Native tongue of Juan Diego asked for church to be built in her honor on the hill of Tepeyak & the Miracle ,I could imagine what it must of been like  I could not wait for the indian scribe to come on to watch the events unfold this is where the story should of been focused 100%, time and effort would of been better spent on a history leading up to these events & the after effects, would of been better story line , but all in all you have to eat the meat & spit out the bones I would buy this for the story of Juan Diego Y la Virgen de Guadalupe not the modern plot clip clip snip snip!",1323648000,2,1971,4.020408163265306

I wish amazon can return back I'd hate to keep such junk (no offense to our beloved mother).",1286841600,,370,4.3
3002436,5,B000XFVINK,"What a lovely film and yes it has a lot of important and accurate information concerning the legends, truth, traditions of this most important religious and cultural icon of Mexico, for lovers of the Holy Mother and stories of apparitions.

Well done to the script writer to mix and mingle a contemporary story with the more ancient story.  The filming is lovely, the actors are good, the film is there for the whole family to enjoy!

I am a student of the Holy Mother, of images and apparitions that have been seen around the world and this film is a very wonderful inclusion to my growing DVD collection.

The subtitles seem to be good, and there are few if any English mistakes in the subtitles - alwaysa  plus.

There is also something very magical about watching this film for the first time....thank you to the film makers for your devotion and skill!",1280448000,,857,4.605263157894737
3002437,5,B000XFVINK,"I watched this movie twice as I was concerned I didn't catch all the nuances.  I need to watch it again as there is so much packed into this wonderful story.  Four stories at once are told simultaneously as they weave in and out of the original saga of the 1531 miracle of the virgin maiden appearing to Juan Diego.  The man who plays Juan Diego is an excellent actor and a dopleganger for Juanito.  Mary herself if played by a sweet spirited and charming young girl as we would expect of Mother Mary.  Remarkably both Juan Diego and Maria speak Nahuatl as they should and this is very perceptive of the movie producers to include this element.

The movie also ties in all the remarkable, miraculous, and scientific elements into the story line.  The miniature portraits of the people in the room as seen during the manifestation of the apparition are there in her eyes, the preservation of the tilma for nearly 500 years, the production of an image on an agave cloth that is more akin to a photograph and uses no pigment, and on and on.

I am an anthropologist/archaeologist that has been studying the Tilma extensively and this film is startingly accurate.  It also provides an understanding to those who are not Mexican of how the Mexican culture developed and what role Guadalupe plays in this ethnogenesis.

It also makes a wonderful statement regarding the role of faith and family.  All in all a wonderful cinema.  Good job.  You'll enjoy it.",1264550400,8,1449,4.635294117647059
3002438,5,B000XFVINK,"As a Spanish teacher I am always looking for an educational movie that is interesting, historically true, and moving.  You have all three in ""Guadalupe.""  This movie is the ""Christmas Story"" of Mexico.  Traditionally we watch ""Ralphy"" and his experiences as a young adolescent during Christmas.  This is the iconic picture from Mexican culture that the entire family gathers around to watch before, after, or on Dec. 12.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.",1262908800,,451,5.027027027027027

3002442,4,B000XFVINK,"It gives a nice overview of how Guadalupe came to be, but is rather sparse on detail there. The parallel story line of contemporary relationships somewhat interweaves this first narrative, telling about some Spanish/International scholars doing some sort of research at or about Guadalupe, and having some typical modern relationship problems. It's probably all very clear to the cineast aficionado expert, but to one raised on action films and slapstick, it's just a way for the director to show how artsy he can be when he wants to. Nice to watch, though, and does not sneer at catholic tradition, like so many works of the Hollywood mainstream feel compelled to do...",1204156800,6,670,5.045045045045045

3002447,3,B000XFVINK,"Anyone drawn to this film by its promise to reveal the many mysteries of the image left on Juan Diego's tilma is likely to be disappointed because the movie's emphasis falls far more heavily on the unification of the factitious family portrayed in the film than it does on the marvels that happened and continue to happen in relation to the apparition of Our Lady in Mexico in 1510.  The idea of submerging the documentary element in a modern day story strikes me as a good one; but, sadly, the story overpowers the documentary to the extent that, at best, the movie seems to me capably of touching only the choir.

A more discerning audience would, I suspect, appreciate knowing more about its suggestion that the apparition at Guadalupe was predicted some 1500 years before it happened. Likewise, the film fails to note that the stars as they appear on Our Lady's mantle are presented as they would appear to someone looking down from above them rather than from the earth to the sky above.  Neither does it explain its reference to the ""photographic"" aspect of Our Lady's eyes--nor the significance of the flowers depicted on her tunic....

In sum, it appears to me that the film makers had much less knowledge of the Guadalupe event than they purport to have and that, like the various copies shown of the real image in the film (all of which are inaccurate), their achievement is a pious expression of faith that is sadly in need of discipline.",1200700800,36,1449,4.670588235294118

Though, it's in Spanish with English subtitles, I enjoyed the actors.  You really felt Juan Diego's innocence and humbleness.

Please do not pay any attention to those reviews which criticize it for not being a documentary. It never said it was. This movie is a well-made, engaging story of deep human responses to the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe with outstanding actors and actresses. You will become drawn into the drama of the human experience, and that's the strength of this movie. I highly recommend it for family viewing, as it tells the story of people who find inspiration and strength in the miracle. I am not a native speaker of Spanish, but the English subtitles were just fine for me. This is a refreshing alternative to the trash that's on TV. Watch it with your teenagers and see them become engaged in this lovely story of faith and devotion.",1357257600,2,848,4.66

Well done to the script writer to mix and mingle a contemporary story with the more ancient story.  The filming is lovely, the actors are good, the film is there for the whole family to enjoy!

I am a student of the Holy Mother, of images and apparitions that have been seen around the world and this film is a very wonderful inclusion to my growing DVD collection.

The subtitles seem to be good, and there are few if any English mistakes in the subtitles - alwaysa  plus.

There is also something very magical about watching this film for the first time....thank you to the film makers for your devotion and skill!",1280448000,,857,4.605263157894737
3236934,5,B000XFVINK,"I watched this movie twice as I was concerned I didn't catch all the nuances.  I need to watch it again as there is so much packed into this wonderful story.  Four stories at once are told simultaneously as they weave in and out of the original saga of the 1531 miracle of the virgin maiden appearing to Juan Diego.  The man who plays Juan Diego is an excellent actor and a dopleganger for Juanito.  Mary herself if played by a sweet spirited and charming young girl as we would expect of Mother Mary.  Remarkably both Juan Diego and Maria speak Nahuatl as they should and this is very perceptive of the movie producers to include this element.

The movie also ties in all the remarkable, miraculous, and scientific elements into the story line.  The miniature portraits of the people in the room as seen during the manifestation of the apparition are there in her eyes, the preservation of the tilma for nearly 500 years, the production of an image on an agave cloth that is more akin to a photograph and uses no pigment, and on and on.

I am an anthropologist/archaeologist that has been studying the Tilma extensively and this film is startingly accurate.  It also provides an understanding to those who are not Mexican of how the Mexican culture developed and what role Guadalupe plays in this ethnogenesis.

It also makes a wonderful statement regarding the role of faith and family.  All in all a wonderful cinema.  Good job.  You'll enjoy it.",1264550400,8,1449,4.635294117647059

3236939,4,B000XFVINK,"It gives a nice overview of how Guadalupe came to be, but is rather sparse on detail there. The parallel story line of contemporary relationships somewhat interweaves this first narrative, telling about some Spanish/International scholars doing some sort of research at or about Guadalupe, and having some typical modern relationship problems. It's probably all very clear to the cineast aficionado expert, but to one raised on action films and slapstick, it's just a way for the director to show how artsy he can be when he wants to.

3236944,3,B000XFVINK,"Anyone drawn to this film by its promise to reveal the many mysteries of the image left on Juan Diego's tilma is likely to be disappointed because the movie's emphasis falls far more heavily on the unification of the factitious family portrayed in the film than it does on the marvels that happened and continue to happen in relation to the apparition of Our Lady in Mexico in 1510.  The idea of submerging the documentary element in a modern day story strikes me as a good one; but, sadly, the story overpowers the documentary to the extent that, at best, the movie seems to me capably of touching only the choir.

A more discerning audience would, I suspect, appreciate knowing more about its suggestion that the apparition at Guadalupe was predicted some 1500 years before it happened. Likewise, the film fails to note that the stars as they appear on Our Lady's mantle are presented as they would appear to someone looking down from above them rather than from the earth to the sky above.  Neither does it explain its reference to the ""photographic"" aspect of Our Lady's eyes--nor the significance of the flowers depicted on her tunic....

In sum, it appears to me that the film makers had much less knowledge of the Guadalupe event than they purport to have and that, like the various copies shown of the real image in the film (all of which are inaccurate), their achievement is a pious expression of faith that is sadly in need of discipline.",1200700800,36,1449,4.670588235294118
