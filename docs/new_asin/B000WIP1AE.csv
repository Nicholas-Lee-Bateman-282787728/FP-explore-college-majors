8223541,3,B000WIP1AE,"The Battle of the River Plate, 1957 film

This is a story about the pursuit and sinking of the German merchant raider Graf Spee It sank the merchant ships that supplied Great Britain. Survivors were kept on board until they could be transferred to a supply ship. The Graf Spee was disguised to look like an American cruiser (a neutral country at that time). Captured British seamen are kept imprisoned in one big room. One ship was scuttled to deny supplies to the enemy. Three British cruisers are searching for the Graf Spee but are outgunned. They have reports on the location of the Graf Spee. The Fleet Captain estimates where the Graf Spee will be and plans the attack. Three ships will sail towards it while attacking it simultaneously.

A scout biplane is sent aloft. Keep a sharp lookout. Then smoke is seen on the horizon. They order an attack, full speed ahead. They open fire with their guns, the enemy returns fire. The scout airplane reports their shots are falling short. As a last resort they will ram the enemy (sinking both). A shot hits the Exeter, shes out of action. The Graf Spee arrives in Montevideo harbor, their prisoners will be set free in this neutral country. A reporter wants to send a message to New York. Warships are not allowed to rearm in a neutral port. People look at the Graf Spee. Another British warship arrives. The Graf Spee is granted 72 hours to make repairs. But the British want it to be kept longer so reinforcements can arrive.

The British Commodore receives an award. A Naval attach reports on an insecure line that British capital ships will soon arrive. A French merchant ship has left, requiring a 24 hour delay for any enemy warship. What will Langsdorf do? What will the British ships do? The prisoners on the Graf Spee are released. Then the Graf Spee begins to move out, followed by a German merchant ship. It sails to the three-mile limit then halts. There are explosions from the Graf Spee! Well, thats that.

The fortunes of war have changed. Its like a forecast of the rest of the war. The Allies won in the end after losing at the beginning. This is educational and entertaining, even if restrained. It shows views of the harbor of Montevideo. This movie is also known by a different title.",1447804800,,2253,4.610972568578553
8223542,5,B000WIP1AE,"Reviewer posting 1 star should get a life.  It's not the sellers responsibility that you can't read the fact that this offering is PAL format.  The content was described properly.  This is a great DVD, at a reasonable price. I actually have a region free dvd player to compliment my regular Blu-ray NTSC formated one.  Sometimes you just can't get a particular DVD title in our NTSC format.",1440547200,,390,4.6911764705882355

8223544,5,B000WIP1AE,"The Battle of the River Plate (also entitled Pursuit of the Graf Spee) features one of the most realistic and finest depictions of a naval battle that I've ever seen in a movie.  Unlike most (Sink the Bismarck, In Harm's Way etc.) this picture didn't use models to depict either the British cruisers or the Graf Spee in a huge water-filled tank on a sound stage.  Instead, the producers used stock footage of several real Royal Navy ships on the open ocean and underweigh, with the Graf Spee being portrayed by a US heavy cruiser.  The battle scenes and the background footage is superb, as is the photography taken of Montevideo, its waterfront, and its nightclubs.

The fact that Shakespeare's Henry V (with Olivier) is on the flip side is a bonus.

Interesting aside:  The only dvd available I was able to find anywhere that would operate on American equipment was made in Brazil.  Naturally, one would expect there to be subtitles in Portugese.  Surprisingly, the subtitles are in German when German is being spoken, and French when French is being spoken.  The only time subtitles are not present is when English is spoken.

I can wish those of you attempting to get this dvd all the luck in the world.  I hope you'll find one available.",1206662400,5,1242,4.67741935483871
