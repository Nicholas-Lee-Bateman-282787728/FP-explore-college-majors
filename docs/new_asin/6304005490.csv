752953,5,6304005490,"Out of the Three films Doris,Rock,and Tony made together,this is my favorite. I love all three movies,but this one's the best. The ending has got to be the funniest finals of any movie ever made.""That's what I  call cutting it close."" I don't know how they got away with this in  1961. Doris Day has always been my favorite movie star,and I wrote to her  when I was a kid,and she sent me a beutifull letter back,signed in Ink. I  can still here my grandmother laugh when Doris left Rock  at the beach  with no clothes on. I also love Tony Randall's performace. He really makes  the movie that much special. Donna Douglas  has a small part in the  movie,along with Edie Adams. Do you beleive that Doris was suppose to do  The Graduate,playing Mrs Robinson?What a great change this would have been  for the actress. At least we have all of her fantastic musicals and  comedies to look at forever. There will never be another Doris Day.",953164800,24,933,4.488095238095238

753427,5,6304005490,"When the complexity, violence and injustice in the world start to weigh me down, I escape back through time to watch any Doris Day movie I can get my hands on.  Like Audrey Hepburn, Doris was a truly luminous soul and it had nothing to do with the Hollywood makeup department.  Very few actors in the entertainment industry today are able to just simply bring happiness to people by watching their work.  Lover Come Back has ok dialogue that could have been much sharper and bolder, but Rock and Doris were able transform the silliest scripts into a high level of amusement and fun with their fantastic chemistry.  In fact, Doris brought out the very best in anyone she worked with.  Just a fabulous lady.",1439164800,,705,4.608

how the competition played  dirty. Not unlike those dudes on the Fall 2013 season of The Bachelorette. I only pray that show is scripted. Can you imagine why a guy would want to write that way for a man? But I digress.

Doris Day plays the Lady executive up until 61,  has Doris  really competing with Rock Hudson's character,( a rock star ad executive) for a client  while  at the same time struggling in an affair with a Nerdy Scientist, also Rock. He's playing dirty to when the girl and the client but he's  his own competition  so that's okay. Tony Randall  was stellar as the sheltered,  insecure Boss who wants to be his employee when he grows up. TR you were absolutely  adorable.

This time around, I was struck by many scenes that are both hilarious and epic, e.g. the shot of the billboard: 'V Day is Coming.' Simultaneously an announcement of the impending doom (time running out to make something) and the theft of the material from Day.

754193,4,6304005490,"Even though it seems like Doris Day and Rock Hudson made as many films as Tracy and Hepburn, they actually made just three for Universal between 1959 and 1964. The trio of films Day and Hudson made hardly reflects pinnacles in cinema history, but they show what deft writing, nimble direction and expert farceurs can do to make these souffl-light romantic comedies thoroughly enjoyable. As my favorite of the three, this frenetic 1961 farce evolves from a familiar act of deception initiated by Hudson's character, at which point it becomes a series of humiliations and comeuppances for both principals before the inevitable happy ending.

Directed by Delbert Mann and written by Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning, the movie works the exact same plot devices as 1959's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pillow-Talk/dp/B0001CNRC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pillow Talk</a>, even the split-screen confrontations, but converts the pair into highly competitive advertising account executives at separate agencies. This time, Day is even more priggish as Carol Templeton, who loathes Hudson's Jerry Webster, as he manages to steal accounts under her and everybody else's nose by holding wild parties for the prospective clients. In an effort to pacify an ambitious model who wants to become a TV star, he shoots her in commercials for VIP, a product that doesn't exist.

Through the incompetence of his nominal boss Pete Ramsey, the commercials hit the airwaves, which force Jerry to recruit reclusive scientist Linus Tyler to invent a product for VIP. In her effort to steal the VIP account from Jerry, Carol mistakes Jerry for Linus, and the rest becomes inevitable. Since Shapiro also co-wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pillow-Talk/dp/B0001CNRC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pillow Talk</a>, this one gets even more far-fetched, but its lightning-quick pace, plethora of sexual double-entendres, constant tweaking of Madison Avenue ad agencies and a wildly improbable ending make it a funnier movie. Both Day and Hudson show themselves to be expert at this type of formulaic romantic comedy, and perennial third-wheel Tony Randall plays Ramsey with his trademark boastful befuddlement.

Rock Hudson seems heroically determined to invite rumors by pretending to be unsure of his sexuality (""Just because you can light a stove doesn't mean you can cook"") and even creeping back into his apartment wearing nothing more than a woman's fur coat (""He's the last guy I would have figured..."" notes one onlooker) while a somewhat sidelined Doris Day gets married as she's rushed into the delivery room.

The script is tight and never insults our intelligence with implausible plot points.  And the stars, Rock hudson, Doris Day and Tony Randall, are at their peak.  And the feature roles are filled with great character players (Anne B. Davis, Joe Flynn and the great Jack Oakie).  You'd almost think it was the golden age of the Studio System.

It's difficult to summarize the plot, because it would be like explaining the punch line of a great joke.  Trust me on this: Lover Come Back will go down as one of the great comedies in movie history.

There's a scene at the Aquarium, where Jerry Webster seduces Carol Templeton.  It takes place in front of a tank with an anglerfish and a minnow.  Need I say more?",1126742400,5,979,4.449438202247191
754260,5,6304005490,"Doris Day is the greatest of all living movie stars and it is an unbelievable oversight that she has not been awarded an honorary Oscar for her lifetime achievement.

Here in LOVER COME BACK she plays Carol Templeton, an advertising executive who learns what it's like to have to play the sleazy way.  It's the kind of part that Ida Lupino had played in a previous generation of tough-talking actresses, but the script has Doris playing it light, though as all her fans know, when she gets mad, it's even funnier.  She stops still, juts out her lower lip, and shoots a jet of breath up her face to tousle her bangs.  Here she's upset with Rock Hudson's character, the louche playboy Jerry Templeton, and his cut-throat ways and me-first philosophy; but as usual she doesn't know it's him when she meets Rock, who lets her think he's a client instead of a competitor who despises her.

Yes, as other reviewers have noted, this is a film with a lot of hard edges, it's brittle and even bitter, like THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS.  The Madison Avenue background was so popular in studio films of the early 60s--was it that Hollywood screenwriters had at last found a job description even more venal and phoney than their own, and thus could deliver venom on target?  Edie Adams plays ""Rebel"" as though she were the star of the movie, daring the camera to move away from her body; she's very funny in what might be her most convincing part.  Rock is great, but you can't help feeling that the movie is tilted towards Doris; Rock's a good sport who let Doris run away with the acting honors in all of their films together.  It's not that he couldn't act, or that he was too far down on the food chain of stardom to have his part re-written to make it larger (or more sympathetic).  He chose not to, making him the most chivalrous actor in Hollywood and the perfect complement to Doris' often abused persona.  Finally, a guy who didn't walk all over her.  We'd love him for that alone, even if he didn't appear nude but for a fur coat in this delightful Universal romp.",1117756800,2,2060,4.478609625668449

754263,3,6304005490,"Oh. My. Gawd.  I mean, for years and years and years, we've all heard the feminist critiques of how Doris Day was an example of the retrograde sexism of her times -- the Eisenhower era and the early, pre-feminist Sixties, blah blah blah -- but in movie after movie, I've seen her portray a capable, cheerfully assertive participant in the battle of the sexes -- no doormat here!  The Doris Day-as-antifeminist icon thing seemed like a bum rap to me.  This film, however, is the first one of the classic Doris Day-Rock Hudson bouts I've seen in which Day is, pure and simple, a victim and a sap.  Hudson co-stars as a rival advertising executive, who uses tacky boy's club tactics to steal Doris's clients out from under her.  Rock takes a guy out drinking, provides a few call girls and --zingo!!-- he lands the MagnaSoap contract.  Doris stammers and clenches her fists, struggles to give him a piece of her mind, while he in turn jeers at her, calls her frigid, and flaunts his sexual mastery at all possible junctures... Of course, their first battle is fought, as in ""Party Line,"" over the phone, so she hasn't had a chance yet to see what a hunk he is.  In Round Two, Doris assertively hauls him in front of the review board of the chamber of commerce, a decisive act that boomerangs when, with a nudge and a wink, Rock makes a fool out of her in front of the all-male panel and walks away unscathed.  From that moment on, he's got Doris under his thumb, besting her at every turn, and, finally, gets her so drunk that she beds him, winds up pregnant and is forced to marry him and live, um, happily ever after.
The script is peppered with the most aggressively sexist dialogue of any of their films -- it's as though, after having set the formula and worked through it in several previous films, the Hudson-Day producers felt they had to one-up themselves and make it more extreme, punchier, harder.  The humor has an underlying mean-spiritedness and misogyny, a lack of balance that's exemplified by the Hudson character's near-complete lack of growth.  You assume, early on, that during his seduction of this hapless female, that he will unwittingly fall in love with her and become a better person, but througout the course of the film, the only moderation in his behavior comes at the very end, when he realizes he would rather stay married to her than not.  Nonetheless, he's never actually contrite or abashed, Hudson's still pretty much a jerk when the curtain closes and it's up to Day to recognize that her physical attraction to him trumps their past history.  Plus, she's all knocked up: what's a good girl to do?  As a result, the film isn't as enjoyable or as pleasant and frothy as other Doris Day films, in fact, I found it a bit jarring, although the glimpse back at old-school male chauvinism can be pretty instructive.
On a more entertaining note, this has some of the most delectable and blatant homoerotic/demi-gay undertones of any of Hudson's films.  The scene in which Hudson cradles Tony Randall's head in his hand (to help swab some dye off his face) is charged with erotic power; in the next scene, we find that Randall has spent the night at Rock's apartment, and not long after that, Hudson announces that he's giving up New York and is going to move to San Francisco(!)  It's all semi-coincidental, of course, but pretty rife with campy thrills, given the later disclosures about Hudson's private life.  In sum, this film is super-retro and Neanderthal, not as much fun as early versions of the same material, but it does have considerable camp value, if that sort of irony-laden anti-notalgia is your kinda thing.",1085097600,9,3649,4.660436137071651

This time it's Rock that needs the tomato juice after being out all night, still in his tuxedo, he was driven right to work.  Rock has an agency's account to nab, so of course a little nightclub dinner and party is in order. Meanwhile, Doris Day is trying to get the same agency's account with true professionalism.  When she finds out she is to late for the account because of Rock's presentation of a ""Roman orgy"", she is appalled.  Here is where Tony Randall comes in.  He gives Rock a talking to about his methods and to apologize to Doris.  Phone bantering goes on between the two.  Rock doesn't apologize but insults her purity.  The war is on.  Rock invents a fictional product called ""Vip"" and uses Edie Adams as a ""Vip"" girl for fake commercials. When Doris finds out about ""Vip"" through Edie's ""good medal of conduct"" at the executive meeting, she tries to get that account too, with the help of Ann B. Davis (Bob Cummings Show, The Brady Bunch).  Isn't that a beautiful top Doris Day is wearing just before the shocker?  Nice fur coat Rock Hudson is wearing.

  Cast also includes: Jack Oakie, Jack Kruschen, Joe Flynn, Jack Albertson (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Chico and the Man) , Donna Douglas (The Beverly Hillbillies), Ted Bessel (That Girl) as an Elevator Boy, William ""Billy"" Benedict.

To fans of both these talented and very attractive stars this is a definite must see!  They work oh so well together in this dated but very funny romantic comedy.
Day is playing that character she is so well known for--the simple, elegant, and very innocent type. Hudson is playing well, everyone that wears a skirt.  He is charming playboy who hasn't found the one woman that can tame yet.  Does Day do it?  Watch to find out.
Watching this for a second time after so many years it is just as good, just as funny and sweet as ever. They are both playing ad execs' that are also playing for each other.  Although, Carol Templeton, Day's character, doesn't realize who Hudson is through half the movie. She half wittedly thinks he is the doctor that is the inventor of a new highly advertised yet nonexistent product called VIP.  She falls in love with him.  Jerry Webster, Hudson's charming yet woman chasing character, falls for Carol hard. He keeps the ruse that he is someone else because Carol has no respect for and can't stand Jerry Webster.
Of course, chaos ensues as the couple get to know each other and accidently get married after sampling the new product VIP, which is basically an alcoholic beverage in the form of a candy.
Always funny Tony Randall costars, and he is a master of comedy, a true genius as the sidekick to Hudson.  Ann B. Davis, ""Alice"" in the ""Brady Bunch"" plays Carol's secretary. Also, another t.v. name you may recognize, Donna Douglas, plays a secretary too.
This is frothy 60's comedic fun that has a great cast. It's two big stars are very likable, charasmatic, and beautiful people.

Thank GAWD I never saw any of the ones she did with Rod Taylor back then! Whoever put HIM together with HER had a screw loose! Anyway, to get back to this film, this is definitely one of Day's most slapstick movies, with a heavy accent on commercial satire.
This film was done in the classic style of romantic comedies back then....lots of cameos and supporting roles for actors familiar to movie audiences from TV, (""Schulze"" from ""Love that Bob"" who was also ""Alice"" from ""The Brady Bunch"", Edie Adams, Jack Krutschen,) glitzy, technicolor cinematography, and a state of the art new car for the leading man. It's the usual Doris/Rock formula....Rock is the unrepentant bachelor with the little black book from [heck]; Doris is the virtuous working woman in the same field that ends up resenting him through some early negative confrontation in the movie. The writers usualy engineer their amorous encounters by keeping Rock's actual VISUAL identity a secret...Doris usually hates him sight unseen through phone contact or rumor, but they rely on Rock's charm to deceive Do-Do into ALMOST doing the deed with him, with her discovering the subterfuge only at the last minute.
I'm not giving away any major plot points here, that's the way it was with ALL the Doris/Rock movies....she was always MARRIED to Jim Garner! Anyway...the film is hilarious, has Tony Randall, for ONCE, not playing a priss, and it has GREAT sight gags!

The humour is sharper and more adult, and all the actors nail their characters down perfectly.  Day and Hudson are rival advertising executives, with Day using the by-the-book approach, and Hudson wining, dining, and providing female companionship to lure and sign clients.  Through the kind of mixups you expect from one of their movies, Day comes to believe that Hudson is a client, and then things become complicated.  Tony Randall plays Hudson's boss, an insecure man that wants to protect himself above anything else, but who ends up paying the price over and over for Hudson's antics and schemes. The dialogue has a lot of funny lines and innuendos, and the three leads play it with relish.  The supporting cast of Edie Adams, Ann B. Davis, and others, all add to the fun.  Director Delbert Mann has a sure touch and keeps the film moving along briskly, and even though you can pretty much guess the conclusion, it's a lot of fun getting there.",1007251200,7,1040,4.75
754294,5,6304005490,"The Winter of 1961-62 was a lot warmer thanks to the delightful onscreen antics of Doris Day, Rock Hudson, and Tony Randall, the triumvirate who had made a blockbuster called ""Pillow Talk"" a couple of years earlier.  Reteamed in ""Lover Come Back"", they scored an even greater success this time out. Thanks to a very funny and sharp script penned by Stanley Shapiro, who won an Oscar for ""Talk"", and aided by Delbart Mann's smooth direction, ""Lover"" was the third biggest moneymaking film of 1962, right behind ""That Touch of Mink"", another Day/Shapiro/Mann collaboration.
Seen today, ""Lover Come Back"" remains an uproarious comedy about the advertising trade in New York City.  It's romantic, for sure, but it's also insightful, slightly satiric, and very sexy.
Doris and Rock play competing advertising agents.  She's professional and dedicated, he's unscrupulous, if necessary, seemingly willing to do anything to land an account. When they finally meet, he pretends to be someone else and therefore she falls in love with him. When she realizes who he really is, the romance flounders, briefly, before a ""bundle of joy"" brings things to a happy conclusion.
Despite decades of crass comments from pundits purporting to know what they're talking about, Doris Day does not play a virgin. As in ""Pillow Talk"" and multiple other films, she plays a highly successful career woman who refuses to become a ""notch"" on some man's belt.  There is never an indication that she is an ""innocent"", merely that she will not sleep with a man who has attempted to dupe, deceive, lie to or manipulate her. In ""Lover"", she offers to teach Hudson how to make love, clearly indicating that she is experienced.  This fails to happen only when she realizes that Hudson, playing Jerry Webster, has been misleading her for two reels. Anyone who avoids seeing a Doris Day film for fear of being exposed to an overage girl scout should give this film a try.  It may well change their preconceived notions. There is a reason why Day was repeatedly voted number one box-office attraction, male or female, as well as being a multiple Golden Globe Award Winner as World Film Favorite and winning the coveted Laurel Award from motion picture exhibitors as top female star for an unprecendented 8 consecutive years.
Doris Day and Rock Hudson are perfect together, creating a blend that is a pure delight.  They play every scene with such a sense of joie de vivre, that the audience cannot help but be caught up in the onscreen tale unfolding.  Once again, Tony Randall provides outstanding support, and the remaining cast members including Edie Adams, Jack Kruschen, Jack Albertson, and Ann B. Davis, are each exceptional in their individual ways.
Director Delbert Mann has stated that some scenes had to be shot a number of times due to the fact that stars Day and Hudson kept breaking up on camera, going into fits of laughter.  It's apparent from the finished product that that sense of fun has been transferred directly to the finished product.  ""Lover Come Back"" is a must see comedy treat.",972864000,48,3064,4.909090909090909

Carol Templeton (Doris) thinks Jerry Webster (Rock) is unethical in his business practices and while trying to catch him at it is also trying to steel his next account. Jerry on the other hand is just trying to catch Carol and parries her attack with the VIP girl. While he is occupied with the chase, Peter 'Pete' Ramsey proceeds to sell VIP. Things just heat up from there.

My favorite part is where Tony Randall uses a moose call and gets what he wants.",1501977600,,572,4.607843137254902
