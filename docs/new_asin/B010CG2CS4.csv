8721963,2,B010CG2CS4,"Entertaining. I can see you put a lot of work in it. I wonder what you could do with a better budget.
Have you ever tried making found footage style films? In my opinion, that would be the way to go.",1503619200,,199,3.8780487804878048
8721964,4,B010CG2CS4,Ok remember the over-gore of the 1980s? Imagine that mixed with a Dali surrealist film... and bam you've got Faim De Mort! What a trippy and admittedly funny film... in a very morbid and twisted fashion. A genuine work of art/ genius!,1489276800,,234,4.595238095238095

8721966,5,B010CG2CS4,"This film was recommended to me by the president of Unearthed Films and I have to say it lives up to my expectations.  It's sort of like the Evil Dead but without a fleshed out plot.  It's primarily gory effects for 35 minutes.  This reminds me of an art film but with tons of gore.  There are even some comedic moments in it as well (if you have a warped sense of humor that is).

It reminds me of a cross between an art class film mixed with the special effects of Evil Dead.  There is no dialogue just music and sound effects.  I thought this was really well done but it's definitely not for the kiddies.  The effects are all practical effects which is also nice to see for a change.  I don't mind CGI as long as it's done tastefully but there is no CGI in this feature.  It reminds me a little of some of the old direct to video movies of the 80's but with a lot more style.",1446681600,6,878,4.023121387283237
