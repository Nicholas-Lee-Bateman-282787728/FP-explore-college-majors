7872094,5,6304460600,"This is a rarely seen videotape recording of the 1965 Broaway presentation of Anton Chekhov's classic play ""The Three Sisters"". Geraldine Page, Kim Stanley, and Sandy Dennis are sensational in the title roles: three equally unhappy women who believe their dreary lives will improve if they can just return to their childhood home in Moscow. Shelley Winters co-stars as their nagging, irritating sister-in-law who doesn't do much to make their lives easier. All in all, this is a faithful rendition of the Chekhov play, but the all-star cast is what makes the film so enjoyable.",972518400,22,577,5.08421052631579
