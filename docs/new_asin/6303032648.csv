559413,2,6303032648,"""Flesh and Bone"" earns two stars only because of the acting brilliance of Gwyneth Paltrow. She is thoroughly believable as Ginnie, a poorly educated girl-woman who even steals from corpses awaiting burial. Ginnie has a serious alcohol dependency problem, and seeks love and companionship from the much older Roy Sweeney (James Cann). Unfortunately, Paltrow has only has a supporting role in this mess of a movie. The other marquee named cast members include both Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. Why did they involve themselves in ""Flesh and Bone?"" Paltrow at least had an excuse because her career was in its early stages eight years ago. One can only assume that Cann wanted the challenge to portray someone totally manipulative and despicable. Cann's intentions may have been noble, but in the future he needn't be so lackadaisical and careless in his actual choices.
The story line revolves around the peculiar family values embraced by Roy and his son Arlis (Quaid). At the very beginning, we witness Roy wiping out a family so as not to leave behind any witnesses and ""loose ends."" A very young boy is even deliberately slaughtered by the father. Arlis is exhorted to always remain loyal to his immediate family regardless of their violent misdeeds. Blood is supposedly more important than adhering to the standard moral norms of compassion and honesty. Quaid's character is far too normal and decent. In real life, it is far likelier that an Arlis would be just as psychopathic as his primary parental role model. Meg Ryan as Kay is also never for a moment convincing as an adult woman of a proverbial white trash background. She fails completely to hide her upper middle class diction. The Director Steven Kloves apparently thought that Ryan's authenticity would be unquestioned if she merely left her hair uncombed. He was egregiously wrong, and the audience had to suffer the consequences. Kloves had so much talent to work with, and yet accomplished so little. The movie's pace slowed to the point where personal self discipline was required to sit through ""Flesh and Bone"" until its banal conclusion.
Gwyneth Paltrow fans should make sure ""Flesh and Bone"" is in their collection. All others, however, should not waste their precious time watching this far less than successful attempt at serious film making.",996105600,2,2314,5.028645833333333
559414,5,6303032648,"I'll just be short and to the point. Watch it. Second to ""Hot Dog"" in The Right Stuff, I'd say this is Quaid's quintessential role, and Ryan's best roll ever. Paltrow is perfect, Caan - well, no arguments here - and the cinematogrophy is just beautiful. Makes me want to move to Texas. Too bad that Texan didn't like it. I'm afraid your'e outnumbered Tex!",981849600,2,355,4.476923076923077
559415,4,6303032648,"There is a thin line that movies like Flesh and Bone walk, its story line suggests an overwrought film, with loud scenery chewing acting and flashy camera work. This could have easily turned into a pointless variation on  the pointless U-Turn. A credit then to director Steve Klove and his  cinamatagropher Philippe Rousselot for creating a completely original  beast. You may not know it from a plot description, but you will never see  another film quite like this one.
  In the film's arresting opening scene  an expressionless grim looking boy stands outside a family's house late at  night. He doesn't say a word except that he's lost. They let him in, and  decide to let him stay overnight. But that's not all there is to it, the  boy is actually working with his father on a scheme they've perfected  hundreds of times before, where he waits till the family is asleep and  opens the door to his father to come in and rob the place. Something goes  terribly wrong that night, but the events that transpire in this scene will  haunt every character in this film. This brilliant opening sequence grabs  the veiwer's attention, and makes the slow burning tense plot that follows  all the more mysterious.
  Dennis Quaid stars as Arliss, a man who isn't  much of a talker, ""You're the best listener I've ever met"" Kay  Davies (Meg Ryan) tells him when they first meet. ""Depends on who's  talking"" he replies. As events unfold, with a touch if a supernatural  element we come to fully comprehend why he so unenthusiastic about life.  ""I'm a creature of habit"" he says at one point, and by then we  know exactly why he feels breaking established habits can be deadly.
  The dialogue in this film, which is written by the director, literally  stings. There are no throw away lines, or scenes that merely exist to push  the plot forward. Every line is diliberate and calculated, queitly  delivered by a cast who obviously relish this high quality stuff.
  All  four principle cast member are excellent. I've always admired Dennis Quaid  since Breaking Away, Meg Ryan successfully sheds the light comedy persona,  Gwenyth Paltrow delivers her lines with icey detachment and James Caan is  chilling as a man who ""values his sleep"".
  I'd love to see  more movies by Steve Klove, he has only made one other film The Fabulous  Baker Boys, and most recently he wrote the wonderful Wonder Boys. Seek this  film out, it has a mood all its own.",957484800,10,2434,4.715990453460621
559416,5,6303032648,"Delightfully dark movie delving into the shadows of family secrets and tragic pasts having drastic repurcussions in later life. Excellent performances from Ryan and Quaid who represent the side of human nature  that makes us human. Paltrow and Caan represent the seedy, unredeemable  side that we'd all rather pretend doesn't exist. Aside from the story-line  this is an aesthetically pleasing movie, beautiful cinematography and  haunting silences etch deeply into the viewer's memory.",949017600,5,486,5.708333333333333
559417,5,6303032648,"I just had to share with everyone else what I felt watching this movie. I honestly believe this movie to be the best movie I ever saw.  The story is extremely tragical, and you can't help but hope that this will end up  alright. The stunning ending scene, left me with my mouth open and eyes  full of tears.  This movie simply couldn't have been done better. Meg Ryan  and Dennis Quaid, although being great actors, never reached the level of  acting as they did in this motion picture.  I strongly recommend seeing  it to anyone who hasn't been through a rough romantic affair lately.",947289600,5,585,4.504761904761905
559418,5,6303032648,"No one is less of a Meg Ryan fan than I.  She is, entirely too cutsie for my taste.  Not that she's bad to look at mind you.  But in this film she is about as sexy, real, and sympathetic as possible.  Her performance was  perfect for the part.
Dennis Quaid gives his finest performance ever as  the tormented son of James Caan.
It's pretty easy to see where the film  is headed fairly early in the picture but it's so well acted and directed  that it's well worth the price of admission.  The film is extremely  character driven including an incredibly cheap yet sexy Gwyneth  Paltrow.
The movie has much to say about relationships, loyalty,  selfishness and the price paid because of them.",932947200,18,690,4.475806451612903

559655,4,6303032648,"I remember liking this movie when it first came out.  It is the type of dark, moral tale of the 90's I was fond of at the time.  In the spirit of Seven, The Grifters or A Perfect World, it has Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid at the height of their relationship.  It has the youngest, poorest acting, Gwenyth Paltrow I have ever seen as a white trash aspiring grifter.  It also has a James Caan in the type of role he has made his career playing.

It is flawed, and has plot holes you could drive a mack truck through, but the heart of darkness is not about a trip through the jungle.  You know?",1420070400,2,588,4.025862068965517

What could have been just another boy meets girl is far more complex due to the tragic history they share and the lonesome wide open spaces they inhabit.  If you liked ""No Country For Old Men"" some of the same elements are here albeit in a much slower and more laid back way.

I won't say anything more except that he let his father in when the family was still awake and he was supposed to wait until they were asleep.  James Caan as the father was very evil.  Dennis Quaid as the son was very kind.  This movie shows that biology does not necessarily determine behavior.  You have free will. I felt the ending was sad.",1361577600,,649,4.062992125984252

In fact, I generally can't stand Meg Ryan. I think that is because she spent so much time acting in horrible, cheesy, cookie cutter romantic comedies. This is not one of those. In this film, Ryan's character actually has depth and range. She doesn't just smile and leap about like an annoying pixie. The storyline is deep and dark and all of the actors nail their parts- including the insufferable Gwyneth Paltrow. So, despite being filled with actresses I generally don't like, the movie is excellent because the plot and characters are good. The movie is an unexpected, yet welcome, divergence from the Hollywood norm, which is to spoon feed you happiness, or at least serve it as dessert. I am cheap as heck and normally won't pay more than ten dollars for a DVD. I gladly shelled out nearly thirty for this one. In fact, this is the most expensive single DVD I've ever purchased, and I couldn't be happier to own it.

I enjoyed watching the movie and thought it was well done. It is one of many movies that I have no memory of ever seeing or hearing about. If you have an interest in any of the leading actors and have not seen this film yourself, you should watch it. I think you will be surprised like I was.

No problems with the transaction. I paid what I think was a fair price with decent s/h fees. I would buy from this business again based on this transaction.",1285632000,3,804,4.153846153846154
559707,5,6303032648,"Steve Kloves' Flesh and Bone (1993) is a rare bird indeed, a movie with unassuming depths. A beautiful film, moving and eerie and almost mysterious in its effects, it has a grace and poetry all its own. And it went almost entirely unnoticed by the movie-going public. (Today it is perhaps best known, if known at all, as one of Gwyneth Paltrow's earliest featured roles.) It's easy to see why it disappeared without a trace: it's an incredibly subtle film by any standards, and compared to your average '90s fare, it barely ""exists"" at all. It's like a phantom, a hazy dream. Watching it is like passing through a roadside town, catching a glimpse of a diner and a bar, and imagining the lives of ordinary folk (never so ordinary as we think); then scratching the surface of their routines, and revealing the turmoil beneath. Flesh and Bone is a real road movie, maybe the best of them all, because it creates a perfect sense of people moving, forever moving, but never actually getting anywhere. The characters in the movie are like fish in a barrel, like flies in a sun-drenched room; their movement is central to who they are as people, and also to the meaning and the structure of the film, which is about rootlessness: a lack of having any place to go.  All the characters in Flesh and Bone are restless; they are searching for something without knowing, or especially caring, what. They are simply moving because they cannot bear to remain still;  like blood in the veins, perhaps.

Some people are just no good and need to be taken seriously. This is a quiet, very sad and scary movie.  Meg Ryan did a good job but it didn't change her image.  Dennis Quaid as always was very good. Gwyneth Paltrow was scary but a relief everytime she had a scene.  She was that smart and that pretty in this movie.  I have no idea what Emma and Shakespeare in Love are like and I don't want to know but this movie showed early on why she gets picked for movies with strong directors.",1155340800,9,626,4.140495867768595
559734,5,6303032648,"Before Brangelina there was Mennis...for the most beautiful on (and off screen) couple was Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan.  This was the third installment in the 'Dennis-Meg' film triligy and it's a pretty good one at that.  'Flesh and Bone' serves up a decent thriller with some very good acting all the way around.  Dennis Quaid plays Arlis, a man tormented daily by the memories of his terrible childhood.  He wears this torment etched across his face at all times (if you want to know who Heath Ledger gets his Ennis Del Mar from just watch Dennis here...it's uncanny).  He is a drifter, moving around constantly restocking vending machines for a living in an attempt to forget where he came from.  After having a fall out with her husband, Kay (Meg Ryan) falls into his life bringing home an uncomfortable disturbance in Arlis' all to routine life.  You see, Kay is running from a past that Arlis is connected to in a way he would have never guessed, and it's not until Arlis' 'evil' father Roy (Caan in a brutally frightening performance) shows up with his partner in crime Ginnie (Paltrow in a scene stealing role) that their pasts are revieled.  The final few frames of this film are intence and surreal as you watch Arlis confront the demons he's been running from and take action towards redemption.  Brilliantly scripted, directed and acted this is surely one that will please the viewer.",1148256000,3,1394,4.7272727272727275
559735,5,6303032648,"Both Quaid and Ryan demonstrate the reasons why they've become so respected among members of their craft.  The film is well conceived, well acted, well directed.",1144540800,6,161,5.1923076923076925
559736,4,6303032648,"This is from the director of ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", also ""fabulous"".  Although Kloves wrote the script here, you would have sworn that Jim Thompson, of gritty novel and film noir fame, did.  There is the same theme of inescapable past as in ""The Grifters"" and a rather unknown, which is a shame, film, ""After Dark, My Sweet"". (which stars the grandson of Jackie Gleeson) Quaid and Ryan were superb.  It was very dark and sparse.  A winner.",1140825600,5,443,4.641025641025641
559737,4,6303032648,"Flesh and Bone is an evocative, haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man (played with understated, heartbreaking perfection by Dennis Quaid) who encounters a lost soul (Meg Ryan, outstanding)leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up.

Plotted an as slow burning thriller, this is really more of a complex and intriguing character study of guilt, father-son ties, violent crime and doomed love. Flesh and Bone is a bleak but supremely well crafted film that reaches a truly sad (though inevitable) conclusion. The final moment between our two main characters is incredibly moving (in a very unsentimental sort of way) and a scene that I will never forget. I didn't mind the major plot twist as its no more unbelievable that a dozen of Hollywood's most praised suspense thrillers. The spare, atmospheric photography (set in a desolate, bleak Texas) is exceptional and Thomas Newman's suberb score will get under your skin.

For those who won't something altogether deeper, affecting and more emotionally satisfying with their thrillers (or love stories), Flesh and Bone should be ripe for rediscovery.",1104364800,10,1166,5.229946524064171
559738,2,6303032648,"Director Steve Kloves manages to make Texas look both gorgeous and desolate.  Thomas Newman's score is haunting and evocative; Dennis Quaid, James Caan, Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow offer complex, fleshed out performances.  What destroys the film in my opinion is its listless pandering, its inability to focus on the truth of the issues and its ambiguous and unfulfilled ending.  FLESH AND BONE also pulls a big coincidence that manages to be both improbable and unbelievable.  Kloves ""twist"" is predictable from the moment Meg Ryan appears on the screen, and the inevitable confrontation between Quaid and Caan is also telegraphed a mile away.  In spite of its good performances and atmospheric direction, FLESH AND BONES is empty and pointless.",1098489600,,747,5.243697478991597
559740,5,6303032648,"This is perhaps Meg Ryan's best role as she delivers a truly emotionally scarred and self-forgotten Kay. Ryan's portrait of her character is so real it's scary.
Dennis Quaid is also on one of his best performances, though at the end seems a little off, but not by far. Excellent work.
Gwyneth Paltrow is memorable as she blends into the story so naturally and sharply that eventhough her character is vague in the storytelling, she shines like a true star.
James Caan is scary. He acts so naturally that you wonder if the guy is really like that. He is a solid good artist.
Bottom line: everything comes together (acting, story, photography, pauses) to produce a unique and rare jewel of a movie. If you like movies that make you think and reach deep into the soul, you gotta see it (and probably own it, I know I do).",1057276800,10,818,4.496644295302014
559741,3,6303032648,"This tale of murder and mayhem sat in the backwoods of texas isn't always easy to follow,.  For starters, the two lead characters played by then lovers ryan and quaid, seem oddly mis-matched, he like he isn't really into the role at all, and she is just plain not gritty and hardened enough for this film.
James Caan is deliciously evil in this film, and viewers might get a kick out of a younger Gwyneth Paltrow as Caans young girl friend and companion.  She has a small semi- nude part as well.
There is a nice shot of her and Mey Ryan out in a wheat field towards the end of the movie with their blone hair waving in the breeze.
But for all it could have been the film just never comes together fully.  Still, thats just my opinion you may like it.",1056499200,4,751,4.201388888888889

One review said don't expect to see nudity with Meg Ryan. The same can't be said with Ms Paltrow. She shows off some upper body.

7837383,1,6303032648,"Except for getting to see a lot of gorgeous Meg Ryan in various stages of undress, this one doesn't have much to offer in the way of entertainment. It's a rather depressing two hours of watching a bunch of losers stumble through a series of missteps to a confusing and unsatisfying climax. The plot doesn't really make much sense and has little cohesion. It's strung together by a crime committed by James Caan, who stumbles through the movie as a plot device, and witnessed by the Dennis Quaid character (Caan's son) as a boy. The screenwriter then strings together a series of unrelated and rather odd events until Caan once again shows up unexpectedly to set up the violent climax that is ludicrously overdone and depends upon the audience accepting some far fetched coincidences. All of the actors are usually first rate, but they're sleepwalking through their roles. The plot is so strained that it barely makes sense.",1495324800,,923,4.848101265822785
