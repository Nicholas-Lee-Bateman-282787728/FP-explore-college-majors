8291728,5,B001D5C1LC,"Very moving documentary dealing with a young boy coming of age and the restoration of his relationship with his father, with whom he had no contact since he was a week old.  Also issues of school bullying, escapism thru feudal times and computer games and dealing with life.
Worthwhile for parents and children alike.",1425254400,,317,4.87037037037037
8291729,5,B001D5C1LC,"That city is San Diego, and it takes something really REALLY good to make me forget that SF and LA still monopolize California's culture. My wife and I watched this together and were simply overwhelmed by how much we just wanted to hug everyone involved. Buy it for anyone who knows (or needs to learn) that geeks/nerds make the best heroes.",1295308800,,341,4.60655737704918
8291730,5,B001D5C1LC,"This film thankfully is not condescending towards its subject Colin aka Drakmar, a 14 year old kid in a single parent home, who escapes into into video games, ceramics, and, most importantly, LARPing (makes you wonder if the makers of [ASIN:B001OD4S5A Role Models [Blu-ray]]saw it)].  Central to the story are Colin's relationships with his real estranged father and his father figure/""knight"" Scott.  Not sappy or manipulative.  Definitely worth seeing.",1229731200,3,454,5.550724637681159
