7968340,5,B00006FMDB,"This is a Canadian release that I bought about 3 months before the complete season 1 was released (after which I had to find the Canadian release of the Early Cases vol. 2 to get the rest of season 1).  As for the sound issue someone brought up, remember that this is only a Dolby Digital 2.0 recording, not a 5.1 like season 2.  Therefore, you will really enhance your listening experience if you add a digital audio receiver with optical input and then listen to the episodes in Dolby ProLogic or ProLogic II.  When I watch in PL II, I experience none of the problems you have encountered.",1075852800,22,591,4.4036697247706424
7968341,3,B00006FMDB,"I stumbled upon this item looking for information on the 3rd Season release. I've searched around on other sites and *apparently* this DVD set is the first 12 episodes of Season 1. It *apparently* is a Canadian release, but who knows. All I know is if you own the Season 1 set, don't buy this. Mind you, all this is second hand info, but I found it on a site I trust. I myself don't own this set, I do own the 1st & 2nd Season sets, though, and HIGHLY recommend them. Hope this helps.",1070236800,83,484,4.105263157894737
7968342,3,B00006FMDB,"Sooooo..... is this part of CSI the series? If so, where does it fit in? Is it a single DVD that's got stuff that's part of what's been released in a set, is it something completely different? ...I'm a bit confused and don't want to buy it if I'm going to get stuff that's already in the complete series set.
Anyone out there know?",1068076800,,331,4.1875
7968343,3,B00006FMDB,"My sister bought CSI: Early Cases. I'm watching the second episode right now. The show itself is great fun to watch, although I did have to get through the whole ""it doesn't really work that way"" thing (husband and dad are cops, friend is CSI).
My problem with this set is that the sound varies wildly in volume. Anything with music is too loud, anything with speech is too soft. There is no happy medium. I've been watching it with the subtitles on (a nice feature) because the sound is so bad.
The video looks good, but I probably wouldn't buy this for myself and I sure won't be buying the full series until I find out if the sound is better.",1067126400,13,645,4.295081967213115
7968344,5,B00006FMDB,I love CSI: and anyone who likes CSI: this is a must have. I find watching the DVD's better because you don't have commercials. This DVD set has every CSI: episode from the first season plus a whole bunch of extra material including a music video for Who are you performed by no other than The Who and some behind the sences fotage. So buy this set. Thanks,1049932800,,356,4.25
7968345,5,B00006FMDB,"A truly undeniable best buy. CSI is one of those rare shows that combines intelligent plots/stories with compelling drama and characters that you can respect. CSI was always visually appealing with obviously a great deal of time spent on the special effects used throughout each story, but the DVD brings this to light even more with the more crisp vibrant image imaginable.
THIS is the only way to really appreciate this show. Getting to watch in sequence, grow with the characters and following some common threads from one story to the next only hightens this already phenomenal series.",1041379200,,589,5.020408163265306
7968346,5,B00006FMDB,"This set is a MUST for any CSI fan.  You are able to watch each character as the develop and grow into their roles.  I had forgotten that Brass was the boss in the Pilot Episode. I also forgot what an attitude he had.  I like him much better now.  And by the way, whatever happend to Kathryn's daughter?  Child Protective Services took her away.  What happened?  The only downside is that this set does not contain the entire first season.  It only covers the first 12 episodes.  This is definetly a ""Must Have!""",1037059200,,512,4.361702127659575
