4070178,2,B0035ECHTK,"Blonde orphan (Kaley) goes to fashion school hoping to become a famous designer. She hangs with her two roomates and good buddies.

Megan Fox seems to have a fashion future guaranteed, wearing a pretty outfit that she designed everyday, and letting Kaley and her roomates know that they won't succeed beyond designing boys underwear for a catalog. Is her fashion future certain, and how far would she scheme to succeed?

Kaley discovers that she had a grandfather who headed a mob family and has left the business to her. His second in command guides Kaley into her responsibilities as a mafia boss, which include several businesses, one a clothing factory with a very talented designer as an employee. Now Kaley has to face off with another mob boss while Megan tries to get her thrown out of school for being mafia and finds ways to interfere with Kaley's success.

What Kaley doesn't know is that the FBI is watching her very closely, and a young, goofy agent enrolls in the fashion school to get close to her.",1294790400,3,1013,4.711864406779661
4070179,3,B0035ECHTK,"I bought this movie because I was impressed with Megan Fox's acting and good looks in Transformers 2 (a surprisingly engaging and amusing SciFi). This movie had the best rating of any of her other movies, so I decided to buy it.

I give ""Crimes of Fashion"" three stars as a good (meaning wholesome,entertaining) movie for its intended audience. In my opinion, that audience is the Hanna Montana set (young girls, 12 - 15 year of age). I believe all others will regret paying the money.

That said, I was impressed with Kaley Cuoco's stage presence, fitality, and acting ability. She reminds me of the young actresses in ""Chasing Liberty"" and ""What a Girl Wants"" (both of which appeal to braoder, and older, audiences).

Luckily, I have someone who will appreciate receiving it as a gift.",1294704000,,787,4.772058823529412
4070180,5,B0035ECHTK,"I absolutely love this mood-lifter of a movie about a girl who rises from a hard-knock life to attend the top fashion school in America -- and achieve a whole lot more! Crimes of Fashion combines my love for Project Runway, Mean Girls and the Sopranos!

It's a made-for-TV quality DVD, but it's a great one! Kaley Cuoco reminds me of Goldie Hawn -- so cute!",1286236800,,357,4.409090909090909
4070181,4,B0035ECHTK,Story nearly predictable but fun.  The underdog issue who climbs to success always welcome these days.  Actress Kaley Cuoco refreshingly funny.  Great entertainment for those rainy days.,1278633600,,186,5.814814814814815
4070182,5,B0035ECHTK,"I saw this made for tv movie years and years ago. It is typical of your made for tv movie in quality of production and storyline and script. Of course it is a bit cheesy, but I found it amusing and wonderful for what it was. I was disappointed that it never aired on tv much since its original release but I was very delighted that it came out on dvd! If you have seen this before then you understand my love for it! But if you haven't don't expect too much, because it is after all just a made for tv movie.",1275609600,,508,3.941747572815534
4070183,3,B0035ECHTK,"Although this movie was copyrighted 2004 it was just released on DVD this year.  It apparently started out as a made-for-TV movie.  Kaley Cuoco has the lead role as a studious but unglamorous student at ""Fashion University"", Brooke Taylor (how good is that for a name in clothing fashion?) who soon learns that her grandfather, recently deceased, was a mob boss who left the family business to her.  A variety of plots ensue and intersect: whether or not her two closest friends at school (like her, they are not in the in-crowd) will still accept her once they learn the truth; what happens to the super-bitchy and glamorous Candace (Megan Fox) who wants to expose Brooke's secret mob-connected identity and get her expelled; the FBI agent assigned to take down the new, female mob boss and all her family who falls for her; the rival mob boss who wants to take over her turf; and what really happened to her grandfather.  The acting is frequently a bit over-the-top.  The ""mob"" is totally sanitized and seems pretty harmless.  There is no swearing, no sex scenes, no violence--this is really family fare, and if it were rated, could probably get a ""G"".  It's a comedy with a bit of love story thrown in.  The overall quality is compatible with a made-for-TV movie.  My wife & I both gave it a ""C"".  However it's harmless entertainment and there are some laughs here and there.  If you didn't see this on TV and you enjoy this sort of thing, then you may enjoy this on DVD.  There are subtitles; however there are no special features except one trailer on the DVD version.",1273017600,11,1573,4.618705035971223

4070199,5,B0035ECHTK,"I really liked this movie. It's funny and smart. It does not have any bad language or sex scenes, just a good old fashioned story.
I can't really add to the other posts. Funny movie great acting, except for the undercover agent storyline, they were so inept as to be caricatures of really stupid agents, Also the ""movie"" was taken from a T.V.  movie and has cuts for commercials that are obvious and the end has no credits like a normal movie. Not so much Megan Fox in the movie as Kaley Couco. Bottom line is my wife and I loved this movie. Funnier than I thought it would be.",1419984000,,577,4.245454545454545
4070200,3,B0035ECHTK,OK movie has its good points,1413763200,,28,3.8333333333333335
4070201,2,B0035ECHTK,"COF is an awful movie, painful to watch from the very beginning to the bitter end.. I saw it only because : 1. I couldn't sleep and 2. as a fan of the Big Bang Theory I have a lot of respect for  Kaley Cuoco's acting ability. She is the only positive in this waste of time and money.  Alll of the elements of  a mediocre movie are here:  Mediocre acting (yea, Megan Fox is good looking but that's it) to a predictable plot (anyone could see the agent Jack falling for Cuoco). COF is certainly not worth anyone's time or money.",1406678400,,526,4.127450980392157
4070202,2,B0035ECHTK,A movie  for teens and kids not to be taken seriously as the storyline is unrealistic. Megan Fox has very little role in this I wonder why they put her in the leading stars in their posters and ads.,1397088000,,198,4.076923076923077
4070203,5,B0035ECHTK,"we saw it and loved it.  what an idea with lots of silly that is fun.  Old as we are, we loved it.",1392508800,,98,3.217391304347826
4070224,5,B0035ECHTK,Great gift idea for Christmas. Really good buy during this season. Great for movie night with the family with a bowl of popcorn,1389225600,,127,4.565217391304348
4070225,3,B0035ECHTK,My wife & I were extras in the movie but it was never shown in Canada. That is the only reason after watching it that I wanted to see it.,1384819200,,137,3.6
4070226,5,B0035ECHTK,"Enjoyable family fare than younger kids can safely watch, thank goodness no foul language or sex scenes to corrupt the kids.  No deep plot or storylines, just fun.  Kaley is so adorable I would watch her in anything :o)",1370131200,,219,4.589743589743589
4070227,4,B0035ECHTK,"Let's face it...unless Megan Fox had made it big with ""Transformers"", and Kaley Cuoco with ""The Big Bang Theory"", this movie would have never made the light of day.

Surprisingly, I am glad it did.  I sure wasn't expecting much.  After all, this movie was made in 2004...long before either ""Transformers"", or ""Big Bang.""

The truth is, while the movie is neither memorable, nor will it likely be on your Top Ten List of Movies, it is rather fun and pleasurable.  Fans of ""Penny"" in Big Bang will likely find her performance fun, and fans of Megan Fox will enjoy the pleasure of seeing her before she became famous.

Not a great movie, but it's better than I expected.  Really good fun!",1350259200,,685,4.565573770491803
4070228,4,B0035ECHTK,"I thought this movie was going to be bad, but it wasn't. Two hot chicks and a great storyline. The acting is pretty good, the movie is a low budget movie so the quality of the movie isn't that great. This movie was supposed to be a TV movie and that's why it's not your usual better quality movies. Even though this movie is about the mob, there actually no sex, language, violence or anything bad about it. This is just a clean funny comedy. Get it cheap and you'll like it.",1337644800,,475,4.173913043478261
4070229,4,B0035ECHTK,"Cute blonde fashion major discovers she inherits a position as a mob boss when a relative ""dies"".  This is a movie for those who love a fashion comedy.  The real comedy happens when the two worlds of fashion and crime collide.  I love the mob-inspired fashion line on the runway. And of course, everything works out in the end for a sweet surprise ending.",1337040000,,355,4.515625
4070230,4,B0035ECHTK,"If you are a fan of Kaley Cuoco and wholesome goodness then this is for you! No sex scenes, swearing or violence ( which is saying something considering it is a film supposedly about the mob!) It is well acted and cheesy but pretty harmless. No thinking required!",1310515200,4,263,4.5
4070231,5,B0035ECHTK,"MOVIE MADE FOR ABC FAMILY THAT DISPLAYS THE COMEDIC TALENT OF BIG BANGS KALEY CUOCO.

4070232,4,B0035ECHTK,"I'll be honest, I did not want to see this film, but due to the two on the cover I watched it against my own will and right off the bat it grabbed my attention. The film was aired on ABC Family so you won't see any sex, nudity, foul language etc. Nice little film, not many ""lol"" moments but several ""laugh on inside"" moments. Id give it a chance.",1300320000,,347,3.9714285714285715

8388885,5,B0035ECHTK,I love this movie and Big bang theory star/actress Kaley Cuoco and actress Megan fox did an awesome throwback on this film here Since it premiered on ABC family and I have started watching it i'm going to keep this movie forever,1507248000,,228,4.4523809523809526
