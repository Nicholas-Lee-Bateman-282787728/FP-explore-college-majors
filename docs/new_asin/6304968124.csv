In this film, Marc ""Animal"" Mac Young teaches you how to recognize an impending attack, and how to avoid it. The advise given in the tape in very common sense and realistic. The film concentrates on recognizing and avoiding a threat, instead of fighting the opponent when the attack has happened. Therefore, you don't need any special abilities or skills to use the information presented in this film.

The production of the film is unusually good for an instructional film. They have used several actors to play in the scenes, and they have used several locations to shoot the film. Post-production is also very good for a film like this.

The film is jam-packed with information and practical advise. The only real problem with this film is that there is perhaps too much information for to the length of the film. Now you are presented with perhaps less than one minute of solid information on each subject or sub-category covered in the film. They are able to present all the basics in this time, but you have to watch the film several times, to make sure you don't miss anything vital. Had they used perhaps 30 minutes more on the film, this matter would have been greatly improved.

The information presented in the film is quite basic in nature, and there probably is not much new for a police officer, for example. But for a regular citizen, this film can be worth is't weight in gold.

No there aren't any fighting techniques in this video, but anything which precedes such a scenario. It vividly shows the tactics and thinking of the predator used while stalking its prey. It's an eye opener for anyone concerned about his safety. This is what might safe you not the fancy moves you've learned on the dojo mats. And that I say after nearly 20 years of martial art and self-defense training.",1001376000,5,486,4.597701149425287
