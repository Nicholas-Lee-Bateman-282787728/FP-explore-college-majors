4485264,5,B004W5ALOE,My daughter and hubby have expanded their vocabulary quite a bit by viewing these cd's. They toggle between English and Spanish with each phrase. They also do a summary at the end just in case you missed something. Nicely done.,1337385600,,227,4.7
4485265,3,B004W5ALOE,"My students liked this one the least of the series mainly because their wasn't a section for response. They liked, ""otra vez"". This dvd didn't have that.",1322611200,,153,4.703703703703703
4485266,5,B004W5ALOE,I LOVE these shows! So entertaining and educational. My kids keep on quoting the episodes. We've been looking for another way other than On Demand to watch them. Thank you!,1317081600,,172,4.766666666666667
4485267,5,B004W5ALOE,"This is such a well-done series -- there is no question that it will become a favorite, both with kids and their respective adults! In terms of language, I love that it is bilingual, in a very seamless and natural way, and that the language is fun and useful. Even better, the characters are very funny, in a way that adults will definitely enjoy, too. I have given this DVD as a gift and it became my friends' son's favorite video! This would be a great addition to any elementary Spanish program, too (I know -- I used to teach K-5 Spanish).",1314057600,,543,4.333333333333333
4485268,5,B004W5ALOE,We've been hoping this would come out on DVD ever since we saw it on HBO(?). Very creative and the kids asked to watch it again and again.,1306195200,,138,3.9642857142857144
8444473,1,B004W5ALOE,Episodes are very small bites. Like less than a min each and its only 16 minutes long. Not worth it. Better off watching YouTube videos,1521331200,,135,4.44

8444479,2,B004W5ALOE,"I ordered the El Perro y Gato for my kids, ages 4 and 6.  Both are captivated by it. I ordered based on the series aired on HBO Kids and I expected the same.  I was disappointed that there are only four 5 min segments on this disc. The HBO segments are 24 min each.  Felt like this was not worth the $18.",1409356800,13,304,3.7936507936507935
8444480,5,B004W5ALOE,"Excellent! My son and I are learning Spanish together and this helps a lot and is very entertaining too!

Es mui bueno!",1402704000,,119,4.409090909090909
8444481,5,B004W5ALOE,"Fantastic sweet storylines appeals to the younger crowd and teaches Spanish/English .. The friendship bwn Cat and Dog is charming, and love how they change roles: if cat asks in English, El Perro answers In Spanish  -- and vice versa.  Simple enough story with enough adventure that reinforce vocabulary. -- all good.

8444482,3,B004W5ALOE,"I love El Perro y El Gato!  Can't get enough...and my baby (8 months old) adores the show.  We watch it daily.  El Perro is the fun-loving, know-it-all, always dragging Gato along on adventures.  And El Gato is the lazy, overweight, food-loving, star of the show.  Together they make a really great and entertaining show.  I'm not fluent in Spanish, but that doesn't matter.  It's a great little cartoon, funny, and I've picked up a few Spanish words here and there.  (Like vete means 'go away' lol.)

I own all 4 videos but this one just isn't as good as the others.  If I had to buy them all over again, I probably would skip buying this one.  5 seasons of El Perro y El Gato have aired on HBO.  Season 5 hasn't been released on video yet.  Each season consists of 4-5 mini episodes totally about 25 minutes of show.  But this one doesn't follow that same format.  The episodes on this video are much shorter, less funny, and just not the same.  I believe this is season 1 and I think the show just wasn't as developed when this aired.  My little boy still enjoys it just the same, but it's not as entertaining for adults.

Be sure to get all the others though!",1357430400,6,1163,4.305555555555555
