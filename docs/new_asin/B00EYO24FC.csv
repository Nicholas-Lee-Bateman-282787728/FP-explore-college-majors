8610415,3,B00EYO24FC,I liked the first version of Give and Take more. This one had a less structured workout. More talking too.,1470009600,2,106,4.35
8610416,5,B00EYO24FC,"Yeah, Tracy doesn't waste money on fancy studios and quality video/sound, but all I want is to have her talk me through swinging my bell.",1456444800,2,137,4.52
8610417,5,B00EYO24FC,"The Give & Take KB swing workouts are one of my favorites.  I love the first G&T dvd but the G&T 2 is better.  There is a joint mobility warmup lead by Tracy's husband, Mark Reifkind (highly recommended before working out) with 3 workouts to choose from.  If you are looking for a straightforward swing workout, Tracy provides that.  I like to know how many swings I've completed and on this dvd they count the total for you.  Having said that, on one of the workouts, a 20 swing set was edited out in error.just add 20 more swings at the end.  You can easily do swing workouts on your own, but these dads keep you honest with your time between sets.  The workouts are equal rest to equal work.",1422057600,6,694,4.292307692307692
