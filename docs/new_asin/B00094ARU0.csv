2262562,5,B00094ARU0,"Hercules/The Adventures of Hercules is good cheesy 80's B-movie fun. I remember watching this move when I was a kid and laughing at how cheesy it is. Twenty years later and I still get a laugh watching Lou Ferigno fight the bad guys as Herc. Hercules/The Adventures of Hercules is a fun movie for kids and adults of all ages. Grab a big bowl of popcorn and pop this movie in the DVD player for a good time.

Lou Ferigno doesn't say much in these low budget 1980's foreign films (his voice is actually dubbed over) but he has the body and the looks to play the part of Herc effectively. Most of what he does is lift heavy stuff and beat people up. The special effects are hilarious (Seeing Herc fight the mechanical laser shooting robot centaur is worth the price of the DVD alone. The scene where Herc grows into a giant is also a classic. ) but the action is also solid in all the fight scenes. Pick this one up for the kids on a rainy day or a late Saturday nightcap for yourself.",1139788800,,982,4.223404255319149
2262563,3,B00094ARU0,Two sword&sandal movies of a second generation and galactic special effects. Hercules (Lou Ferrigno)is not a cinema actor but an action and powerful bodybuilder that performs feats and challenges that even Superman could not match. Now Ferrigno is real and not in green color as in the Incredible Hulk. The heroe has to rescue a delicious princess (Ingrid Anderson). In the sequel Adventures of Hercules the evil William Berger raises from the dead similarly as Dracula does in some terror movies. This DVD has the high quality level that sword&sandal movies deserve. Congratulations.,1131840000,2,584,5.290322580645161

2262565,3,B00094ARU0,I hate to say it but it is worth the price for two movies on one disc. The movies are considered the worst of the worst for good reason. lol  I have a strange attachment to these movies.,1123977600,5,186,3.8947368421052633
2262566,4,B00094ARU0,"If you are fan, a real fan, of Lou, then this is for you.  If you saw this 22 years ago, it might bring back memories.  This movie, in no way, challenges movies of today or even that time frame.  Graphically it is horrible, the acting is sub par and the story just doesnt match up to most Hercules stories.  But, I grew up with the Hulk, and seeing Lou as Hercules only makes sense.  He is the only Herc that has the body to fit the bill.  The first film, is basically the 7 trials of Hercules.  The story moves along quickly, from one test to the next.  The second film, Herc searches for Zeus's thunderbolts, oddly enough, Zeus knows where they are the whole time.  Its mostly action, with fight sequences lasting only a few moments, consisting of Lou throwing right hands, and sometimes a boulder.  Again, don't expect much visually from this film.  Its simply a classic, for the fans of a generation long since passed.",1122768000,12,922,4.396449704142012

2262612,4,B00094ARU0,"I was expecting some simple sword & sorcery movies, but I got so much more! Lou Ferrigno getting dubbed is disappointing, but somewhat understandable considering his deafness. Both films are kind of all over the place, but that's part of what makes them great. In each film Hercules joins mortals to help complete a quest and encounters all sorts of roadblocks along the way. From hazardous forest creatures to evil wizards to demigods who can turn into light to every type of monster you remember facing when playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons when you were younger. This 2 movie set can usually be had for cheap and if you have ANY interest in Ferrigno, swordplay, wacky special effects or movies that simply try to be fun, don't hesitate to pick this one up!",1471910400,2,763,4.659259259259259

2262668,4,B00094ARU0,"Big Lou takes on a Olympus-sized mountain of cheese in these two corny throwbacks to the golden age of 1960's Italian sweat spectacles. Clearly these were made to cash in on the popularity of CONAN, and it shows. To be honest, Lou is amazingly impressive to look at but not much else. Ferrigno spent five formative years mastering pantomime acting for his memorable role as Bill Bixby's mean, green rage machine alter ego in THE INCREDIBLE HULK, but only got to truly act in one episode, ""King of The Beach""' and that was it.  Even so, his physical presence alone is enough to warrant at least a look at these two movies. In the first entry, HERCULES, Lou's level of muscular definition is jaw-dropping; you can see the individual cords of muscle in his arms, back and legs in some scenes. He was not only massively-muscled here but quite lean as well, and his low body fat allowed his sinews to bulge out with eye-popping clarity. His voice (along with every one else) is dubbed and he pretty much only has three interchangeable facial expressions: amazed, befuddled & enraged. His physique is far less defined in the sequel film but he's still the perfect fit for the part. HERCULES II, aka THE ADVENTURES OF HERCULES is a lot more fun too, IMHO. Most notable are the scenes where Herc battles a hoard of creepy cool Slime Men, and some shaggy green whatsit that looks like the love child of Swamp Thing & Chewbacca. If only both of the films could have been that crazy and entertaining all the way through. And be sure to prepare yourself for some of THE WORST stop-motion animation that you have EVER seen on film. Wow. This stuff makes the dinosaurs in the old Land of The Lost TV show look like the ones from Jurassic Park! Talk about crude. LOL.

The stories are pure hokum, in that several myths are blended together to give Herc a new, yet still familiar set of challenges to overcome. The babes are beautiful, especially sultry villainess Ariadne, (blonde genre tart Sybil Danning), in a memorable breast-enhancing blue dress, and the stunningly enchanting Cassiopeia (Ingrid Anderson) in a white, gossamer, barely-there sacrificial gown - highlighted by a couple of small, very strategically placed seashells. The bad guys are one-dimensional stage-play types who scowl, wring their hands and bellow cartoony evil laughs after almost every nefarious statement they utter. And gaze in wonder at the awful wigs worn by the Olympian gods & goddesses! LOL. The sets are plywood & cardboard, the rocks & boulders are papier-mch, and the swords & armor are all plastic or fiberglass, drenched in heavy layers of runny Krylon gold paint. Basically, these films are just bad - in every possible way. A bummer to some, but for fans of Sword & Sandal spectacles these two films harken back to the good old days of Steve Reeves, Alan Steel and Gordon Scott. Put your thinker in park and just enjoy the unabashed silliness of it all.

This HERCULES double feature arrives from MGM in one of those irritating ""flipper discs"" that have proven problematic for some folks. Unsure if it is player-related or if the nature of the construction of the discs themselves that is to blame. Personally, I have never had any trouble playing these flipper jobs but I'd still prefer a separate disc for each film or else both films simply encoded onto a traditional, single-sided DVD. You probably won't have any trouble, but don't say you weren't warned. BUYER BEWARE. The films themselves look quite good. There's only minimal dirt & grit in the first film. Slightly more gunk to be found in the second feature. The colors are a little over-saturated, but I suspect that's due to the gaudy color schemes and the way these films were shot. Lots of bleeding colors are to be found throughout, especially in scenes where there are lots of optical zips, zaps and crackles (which is a LOT in these things, lemme tell ya!). I got this double feature at a good price and it was a heap of silly fun. Lou is undeniably well-cast as the massive hero and being a big TV Hulk fan I have fond memories of these first legit acting outings for Mr. Ferrigno. 4 STARS for these two boulder-throwing, Grizzly-punching, sword-clanging sweat fests.",1435795200,,4214,4.73841961852861

2262670,5,B00094ARU0,"So this is the only Hercules movie that I really enjoy. It has been redone so many times it isn't worth keeping track of. But this one stands out for me. I mean Lou Ferrigno is the ideal Hercules in my opinion. And the whole ""old fashioned"" special effects thing just works for me. Similar in comparison to another favorite, the 1981 version of Clash Of The Titans. If you like these types of movies, and like me, are less than impressed with the glitz and glamor that has replaced the imagination and substance of older films. You may just find this a beneficial addition to your collection. I'm no so into sequels as a general rule, but in this case, if you enjoy the first one, then the sequel is a decent 2nd. And besides you get them both in one package at a great cost. So what's to loose?",1434931200,,795,4.271523178807947

You gotta give the director credit, though...the movie is so predictable that you can win bets on what ridiculous thing is going to happen next.

Now ofcourse, I saw this when it came out and I was 8yrs old, was a big night out with my cousin at the local drive-in, yes, they did exist in my day. Obviously, I can see how an adult or someone watching it with today's movie standards would find it horrible, or even horribly bad, but for an 8yr old in the 80's who loved Ferrigno from the Hulk, this movie had all kinds of awesome spectacle and adventure. Those bashing the effects, check out similar style movies from the 80's, these effects are not that bad. Only part that truly makes me cringe is ofcourse - The Bear Scene.

Frankly, ""I miss the Robots"" though if MST3K ever did these movies I missed that ep.
Still, it's fun seeing all the 80s painted neon special effects and in the second movie he rides a horse and he is MORE MUSCULAR than said beast:-)

There's ""Blood and Thunder"" and to use a term by Poul Anderson ""Thud and Blunder"".  The former is like Robert E Howard, such as the first Conan movie.  This movie is clearly the latter.  But I love it.  Still neat seeing Hercules running around clobbering monsters and all the women with jiggling boobies, including Sybil Danning.

2262719,5,B00094ARU0,"I'm a fan of Mystery Science Theater and the way the creators of that show parody B-movies by turning down the volume and adding their own dialogue. This movie, with the voice of Lou Ferrigno over-dubbed with that of another voice talent, coupled with terrifically awful special effects makes for the perfect vehicle for adding your own comments, along with your friends and some adult beverages in the comfort of your tv room.

2262721,5,B00094ARU0,"""Hercules"" is a true treasure for those of us who love bad movies, you could hardly ask for a better bad film.  Its as gaudy and ridiculous as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B0038ZITIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>&nbsp;but, unlike that film, none of this seems to be on purpose.

The great thing about ""Hercules"" is that it keeps one-upping itself in terms of craziness.  You see Sybil Danning walk on-screen in what looks like a nursing leotard and think, ""That's gotta be the goofiest outfit in the whole movie!"" only to see her later done up like an Aztec milkmaid.  ""Okay, I guess I was wrong about the outfits, but there's no way its gonna get dumber than that!"" you say, only to be blindsided minutes later by the captured princess walking out with a bra made of clamshells and a dress made out of the clear plastic slats they use in industrial freezers.

The whole movie is like that, you go from Herc thowing a bear into outer space all the way to King Minos' flaming rainbow sword, with each event inbetween being the most ridiculous, hilarious thing you've ever witnessed in a movie... til it gets topped in the next 5 minutes by something crazier still.

The sequel, ""The Adventures Of Hercules"" is cut from the same cloth, but probably only 80% as awesome.  Still, its over 3 hours of bad move magic, making this DVD an absolute must have for any of us out there who love this kind of crap.  You know who you are. :)",1366156800,12,1503,4.889763779527559

I don't think it was trying to be, but it is! This is one of the funniest films you'll ever see. A dead on perfect parody, though I'm not sure the filmmakers knew it at the time. It's a cliche these days to say this, but Hercules really IS a movie so bad that it is great. Watch it as a parody movie and you'll love it too.

2262750,5,B00094ARU0,"Winner of the coveted title of Mr. Olympia and hailed as one of the greatest bodybuilders who ever lived, it seems only natural that Lou Ferrigno would be given the role of Hercules.  The epitome of masculinity, he possessed one of the world's most perfectly developed male physiques.  Described as god-like, it had the ruggedness of Reg Parks and the ascetics of Steve Reeves.

  After his highly successful portrayal of Bruce Banner's alter ego on ""The Incredible Hulk"" series, Ferrigno traveled to Italy where he filmed several sword and sandal films.  He fulfilled his life-long dream of stepping into the sandals of the mighty Hercules - not once, but twice.  ""Hercules"" and ""The Adventures of Hercules"" is a superb double feature from MGM.  In both films, Hercules saves the earth from utter destruction.  Yes, the plots are simple; however, the mythological tales were designed to entertain children and teach them about creation.  (I studied them myself in middle school.)  They are fantasies for the child and the child at heart.  Who better to bring them to the big screen than fantasy auteur Lewis Coates (a.k.a. Luigi Cozzi), famous Italian director who directed the giallo thriller ""The Killer Must Kill Again"" and wrote the screenplay for another Ferrigno vehicle ""Sinbad of the Seven Seas.""

  Each film starred an extremely attractive cast.  Voluptuous bad girl Sybil Danning (""Howling II"" ""Chained Heat"" and ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times) played an evil princess in ""Hercules.""  Both films also boasted an energy-infused, ""Star Wars""-like score from renowned musical composer Pino Donaggio (""Crawlspace,"" ""Don't Look Now"" and ""The Howling."").  Furthermore, the sets and costumes were beautiful.

  These Hercules films are rife with adventure, fantasy and romance and are suitable for Ferrigno fans of all ages.  They are excellent vehicles for showcasing his super masculine physique to the utmost possible while still maintaining modesty.  They are on a par with the films made during the sword and sandal age that prospered during the late fifties to the mid-sixties.  Fans of ""The Incredible Hulk"" series will want to watch this double feature to discover, as I did, how well Lou Ferrigno cleaned up after having all that defacing green makeup removed.",1242086400,,2276,5.18956043956044

DVD seems to have a decent picture quality & plays nicely in a Blu-ray player as stated before this is a Double feature disk so of course you'll be able to watch both films if you like, note there are no extra feature's that's a bummer but if you like this version of Hercules it's a good deal for the price & you do get two movies for price of one

Don't take this film too seriously it's not a big box office film but it's still a fun movie to just chill & watch, I first saw this movie as a kid & I remember giggling a lot, but you know what it's not so bad hahaha it's still entertaining & worth buying.",1231286400,2,834,4.006024096385542

2262784,1,B00094ARU0,"I have no idea what went wrong. The cast seems like a dream: Lou Ferrigno certainly fits the bill (and he CAN act) but is terrible here, William Berger (star of numerous Italian Westerns) is given little to do but stroke his beard and Sybill Danning only redeems herself by the amount of flesh she has on display. The music is great, but is greater than the film it's playing for. The whole thing seems to be taking itself far to seriously for what it is.

I know something like this could work as camp fun, but it just seems dead.

And the second film isn't even worth talking about.",1206662400,2,584,4.3
2262785,4,B00094ARU0,"Lou Ferrigno is truly a monster among body builders. Okay, the acting isn't that great, and the special effects are kind of corny, but even with the multi-million dollar big budget movies you see things that are just to far fetched. One look at the new version of King Kong and I need not say more.

Ferrigno reminded me of the old 60's versions of Hercules starring the great Steve Reeves. It was entertaining and that's what I look for in a movie.",1177804800,3,449,4.409638554216867
2262786,3,B00094ARU0,"See I grew up watching cheap and cheezy movies like this one so I appreciate it differently. For the most part its a good movie in the sense that it shows some of the old greek gods such as Zeus, Posiedon, Athena and so on and so on. I like the greek mythology, so if u do too then this is an adventurous movie for you to watch. Its also casting Lou Ferigno, who to me is pretty good at playing hercules and taking on the treacherous villains that await him. Sorry I was supposed to keep this short, anyway overall the movie is a classic and a adventurous one for an 80's movie so I'd have to give it a 3 star rating.",1162425600,2,617,3.9838709677419355
2262787,5,B00094ARU0,"The first movie here is pretty good, al lthings considered. It's plot moves along nicely and there are pretty girls to look at while Lou Ferrifno whomps on some special effects that, while mechanical, are reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen. The first movie is colorful and had a reasonable budget for special effects. I give the first movie a 5 for being such an ernest film, despite how it slaughters Greek Mythology and has a lot of bad acting. There's a lot of fighting and the monsters are kind of cool. Did I mention the ladies are pretty?

The second movie here just stinks. Unlike the first film which was colorful, now most of it seems to be shot in the same small forest. Instead of special effects involving mechanical monsters, Hercules is fighting people in various rubber suits most of the time. There is a tiny bit of claymation, but if you've seen the medusa scene from Clash of the Titans, you've already seen this scene and seen it done better. The other monster that was sort of vaguely cool was the first one, but it looked almost exactly like the monster from Forbidden Planet. The final fight scene is too horrible to describe. The ladies in this movie are kind of pretty, but nothing that would make this movie a guilty pleasure.

I've seen the first movie lots of times and enjoyed it. I will enver watch the second movie again. If the first movie is cheaper seperately, buy it. If the set is the same price or cheaper, you might as well get it.",1158624000,3,1464,4.5
2262788,4,B00094ARU0,"Yeah, I know, the Ferrigno ""Hercules"" movies are truly lame. The acting is basic, the stories are silly, and the effects aren't cutting edge. More like dull edge. Yet and still, I enjoyed watching these movies as a kid. When I found out both movies were released on DVD I had to add it to my collection. I think they were great adventure flicks. Lou Ferrigno actually did a pretty good job in the acting department and William Berger is deliciously mischeivious as the diabolicol King Minos. If you enjoyed the sword and sorcery fun of movies like ""Beastmaster"" and ""Red Sonja"" and ""Conan"" or just a nutty retro freak then this DVD is one to view.",1155859200,21,647,4.538461538461538
2262789,4,B00094ARU0,"Writer/Director, Luigi Cozzi, has a lot of fun with the ranting evil King Minos, who exalts: ""Not Science in service of the gods, or Science in service of Science, but Science for the sake of Science!!!"" He continues: ""The pure magic of perfect knowledge -- Science -- is impeccable; the absolute dictator of the universal forces."" And probably the funniest line ever uttered: ""Creation came out of chaos, is surrounded by chaos, and will end in chaos, but while we're here, we must have perfect order.""!!! And the result, of course: ""We have eliminated all emotion, all hope, all doubt; there is no uncertainty."" If not for Hercules, the universe would be doomed!",1153958400,4,664,4.884955752212389

2262791,5,B00094ARU0,"Here are some insanely outrageous cheesefests that should satisfy any B flick lover's cravings.  With the huge success of Conan and the Beastmaster I guess it's only natural that the Cannon Group get their fingers in the pie.  These films are both Italian productions.  Hey, why not?  After all, the Italians had the market cornered on sword and sandal flicks back in the day.  Writer/Director ""Lewis Coates""(American companies insisted on Italian directors to use more American sounding pseudonyms) is actually Luigi Cozzi, who as everyone knows, directed the box office smashes Starcrash and everyone's favorite exploding chest flick, Contamination.  Both movies look like they were shot at the same time, and actually feel more like a three hour film than two seperate ones.  The first film starts with some poppycock about astronomy, then has Zeus creating our hero to shift the good/evil balance.  Hercules falls in love however and goes after his love who has been kidnapped by the evil King Minos.  Minos constantly rants about the power of science over that of the gods even though he's constantly using supernatural means to do his deeds.  Not to mention that he wants Herc's girl as a sacrifice to a phoenix fire-god.  On his quest Hercules flexes, bends swords, fights giant windup toys, battles stock footage, punches everyone, throws styrofoam boulders, throws a grizzly bear into outer space, breaks swords on his shins, grows huge, seperates Africa from Europe, and refuses the advances of two women(one of them Sybil Danning!)  How noble.  Once Minos is defeated and his chick saved, Zeus kinda just plucks him into outer space and turns him into a flexing constellation, storing him for further use.  In the second film, Zeus releases him from his suspended flex pose to retrieve seven thunderbolts(they're actually lightning bolts, not that you really give a crap) stolen by renegade gods, Poseidon, Hera and Aphrodite.  These gods resurrect the evil King Minos who's still using magic whilst flapping his gums about the power of science.  Once again Hercules flexes, punches alot of folks, fights slime people and a guy in a makeshift Chewbacca outfit, doesn't hit on either of the two chix who would gladly have him, turns huge again, and transforms into an animated gorilla for some unknown reason to fight the final battle.  Classic.  Cozzi's imagination clearly exceeds his budget, but that's part of the magic of these films.  Both films have tons of scenes in outer space with characters standing on rocky sets which are supposed to be the moon(Mythology tells us the gods hung out on Mount Olympus, but they hang out on the moon in the first film.  By the second film they're supposed to be on Olympus, but it still looks an awful lot like the moon to me.)  Also lots of superimposed shots of the actors on top of the earth.  There are constant scenes of flashing lights and animation accompanied by BLIP! PING! BOINK!-type sound effects that sound like they came from a 60s sci-fi film or an Atari game.  Cozzi has no shame at all as he lifts scenes from Conan, Clash of the Titans(the scene where Herc faces the gorgon is identical to Perseus' in Clash!), and The Beastmaster.  The entire opening credits of the second film directly ripoff the credit sequence from Superman 2, with the blue credits in outer space floating into the screen intercut with scenes from the first film!  The second film goes a bit overboard with animation, even including a fight that could have come straight from a Ralph Bakshi movie.  Lou is a fantastic Hercules(eat your heart out, Sorbo!).  He's no Olivier, but do you really need to be for this kind of film?  I don't think there's a single actor in the world who looks more like a Hercules than Lou Ferrigno.  I love these two films, love em to death.  They're weird, wacky, silly and 100% fun.  Peter Jackson can keep his sillyass gazillion dollar hobbits.  I'll take Hercules.",1142035200,17,3941,4.879699248120301
