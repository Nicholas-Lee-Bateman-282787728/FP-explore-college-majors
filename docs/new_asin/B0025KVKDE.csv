3848568,5,B0025KVKDE,"Southland & Homicide have alot in common as far as Deep edgy Cop Dramas That take a Much more realistic look behind The men and woman
That put there lives on the Line to Serve & Protect

Both Shows have An Amazing ensemble cast  (Perfect Casting!!!!!!!!)
Both Shows Introduced viewers through the eyes of the Rookie Cop
With Homicide  Det. Tim Bayliss  played Perfectly by Kyle Secor
and Southland  Officer Ben Sherman played equally Great  by Ben McKenzie

Enough of me Geeking out over Great Top Notch Cop Shows

Despite all the Positive reviews from both Critics and TV Viewers The Show was Canceled due to the NBC Late Night Re-Tooling
Jay Leno in Prime Time (Boy, that was such a Great Idea!?!?!)

But, out of Nowhere TNT Bought the Show  Thank God
Southland never seem to fit on Network tv (It was To Dark and Raw)
The original broadcast on  NBC was Butchered..........
With TNT alot less bleeps But, Now with the Season One Box Set it's UNCUT
Hopefully if it sells enough Units it will get a BR Transfer
  Believe the Hype and all the Critics

I was going through withdrawal after The Shield went off the air and I was desperate for a new great cop show.  Southland is not it. The keys to a good cop drama are believeable, likeable and realistic charactors, Southland has none of those three ingredients. Southland has instead chosen whiney, annoying, and loathesome actors.  TNT will probably drop this clunker after a few poorly watched episodes just like the other network.  Don't miss the opportunity to pass this one up before it disappears.",1263340800,4,610,4.950980392156863

Michael Cudlitz should have won multiple Emmys for his portrayal of LAPD Training Officer John Cooper, (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!) a sympathetic picture of a tough cop who happens to be gay and has a painkiller problem. Cudlitz DESTROYED this role...one of the finest on an hour long drama, ever. Yeah I know, Bryan Cranston was awesome in ""Breaking Bad"", and he was...but Cudlitz really becomes Cooper and takes us on a great ride with a character we end up rooting for. Also, Regina King is outstanding as Lydia Adams, Shawn Hatosy's Sammy Bryant is a revelation...his relationship with his wife has to be seen to be believed. But,all in all, NBC made a huge mistake in giving this thoughtful, engaging show the boot.",1442448000,,841,4.6891891891891895

3848664,5,B0025KVKDE,"Chance to see Michael Cudlitz, pre-The Walking Dead, and Ben McKenzie, pre-Gotham, in a well-written, acted and directed police show.  Ben's character is not quite as pure as his Gotham character.  Very much an ensemble cast, with each episode covering story-lines from the various teams of cops, keeping it interesting.  Although C. Thomas Howell did not get a starring credit until the 5th Season, he was a recurring ""guest star"" throughout who was very funny in an old-school sexist cop sort of way.  I had never been much of a fan of his until his performance in this show.  Lucy Liu likewise ""guests"" in the same way in Season 4, to very good effect.  Particularly at the low price, it is well-worth buying the entire series.  I had been unaware this NBC series had continued past the First Season, on TNT, until I saw the Second, Third and Fourth Season box set in a local store, and later the Fifth Season.  Very glad I got all of those.",1423440000,3,944,4.5773809523809526

3848667,3,B0025KVKDE,"UPDATE: We've just finished season three courtesy of Channel Four; it's excellent and well worth watching. Having re-watched these first two seasons, it's fair to say that my original review (below) was a little harsh but I think that most of my observations still hold true. All of the teething troubles have been addressed in the excellent third season and season four is due to be aired on more4 in November 2012.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I suppose it must be very difficult to come up with new ideas in the heavily populated genre of police TV drama. While HBO succeeded triumphantly with `The Wire', and 'Law & Order' keeps reinventing itself, Southland just succeeds in being unexceptional. A sort-of fusion between C.H.I.P.S. and LAPD Blue with a Dragnet-style opening voice-over, it tells the story of the probationary period in the career of a newly graduated street cop. We've got all of the stock caricatures; the committed streetwise partner with a drug problem; the abused and down-trodden woman cop; the detective struggling to hold onto any sort of relationship; the selfish uncontrollable teenage daughter; the too-clever-for-the-cops drug dealer (played, surprise, surprise, by Wood Harris ( Avon Barksdale from `The Wire')) ... etc. etc.

You'd have though that, with all of the formula pieces in place, it would have been relatively straightforward to churn out a drama with enough character development and on-going back story to blend the naturally episodic nature of the subject matter into a coherent and engaging series. Unfortunately, this show just proves how difficult that is to do. What we're presented with is a jerky, incoherent jumble mostly filmed in documentary style wobblecam where characters appear and disappear for no apparent reason to the point that it sometimes feels like the episodes are in the wrong order. The dialogue is flat, the acting as formulaic as the roles and the whole package is generally unsatisfactory. It is not truly awful, but neither is it absolutely brilliant.",1420934400,,2017,5.165137614678899

Actress Lucy Lu, playing a cop, checking her smart phone on duty to see where the food truck would be next........in the middle of her crazy, busy day.....So many other asides that show cops to be the human beings that they are -- very good people, very dedicated, very focused....except when they aren't.

3848684,4,B0025KVKDE,"Good series for a cop show. Entertaining drama with realistic characters that draw you in and make you care. It has realistic seeming and sometimes funny situations.  Didn't get 5 stars because the plot got too predictable/cheesy sometimes, like when the training officer says ""put two in the center of mass and if they don't go down, they have a vest on so put one in the head"" Of course the next episode the detective puts two in the chest and he doesn't go down, after realising he has a vest on, shoots him in the head.

I have a perspective of experience with the characters on patrol, especially the field training officer, and the detectives and I can tell you that this is gold.

3848711,5,B0025KVKDE,"It is hard to believe that this remarkable series has been cancelled. But for those of us who are hard core fans of this show, it doesn't seem possible to get one season without collecting the entire 5 seasons. Also, I've seen the televised version of this show, and I HATE any censorship of such fine writing. That being said, getting the DVD's is a must. It seems to me that if anyone has problems with gritty, edgy programming they should go some place else. The same goes for sponsors.  If you're concerned about being offended by language and ""adult situations"" find something else and leave the program alone.",1376092800,,615,4.6422018348623855

3848737,4,B0025KVKDE,"I watched this first season while doing the treadmill and it held my interest.  It is not fast paced, but once you get into the 2nd or 3rd episode the characters have become well defined and you find yourself caught up in their private lives. The lead woman detective is fully fleshed out and the young rookie is nuanced beyond what the viewer might first expect.  Definitely recommend it.",1364342400,,389,4.6231884057971016
3848738,4,B0025KVKDE,"I would recommend buying this season if you are a a fan of the Southland series. Product is exactly as described; for a comparative review of this season see below.

I purchased the first season of Southland since I have recently (last 2 seasons) fell in love with the show. It was useful to watch in order to understand some of the relationship drama currently occurring in the series, however I was rather disappointed that this first season was lacking the same humor and single episode story continuity. This season is much more of a police procedural (though it does not meet this criteria perfectly) than the more reason seasons which focus on the drama of working the streets and interspersing with the inherent humor of dealing with the stupid public.",1363478400,,759,4.793893129770993

From the unique 'over-the-shoulder' filming technique making you feel like a part of the show to the talented actors and believable, realistic story lines submerging you into the lives of the characters, this is without a doubt, a must see show!!

3848742,5,B0025KVKDE,"I loved this when it first came out on TV--gritty and real. Interesting contrast to the police procedurals of the 1960s (Dragnet, Adam-12). No more skinny ties and sport coats-now gangbangers and urban decay. Very glad to have the DVD now; I lost touch with the series after it moved to TNT so I got this as well as the other DVD for seasons 2-4 and am getting caught up. Meanwhile Season 5 is on my DVR to watch once I've done so.

This can be tough to watch because of the realism; but it's fascinating, and very well done. Not everything turns out great, not everyone gets along, and there are occasional funny moments--like when the cops answer a call for a guy who's mad because his tattoo got misspelled.",1362096000,,710,4.419847328244275

3848744,5,B0025KVKDE,"Many things I like:  No background music to manipulate viewer emotions.  Plot points play out simply--no camera tricks to hammer them home.  A lot left to the viewer's intelligence.  A very fine ensemble cast delivers workmanlike performances.  Each character's...um..character stays consistent through the episodes--you get to know them.  Several writers and directors, but splendid continuity.  Realistic rag-tag storylines, not formulaic 'gory crime/investigation/false leads/swat team/capture'.",1361404800,,498,6.6875

I can't figure out how the actors come to work each day with the same vilosity and drama as they did the day before, AND to do it with such 'seamlessness' as they do each day, each episode. This without a doubt the very, very best cop/drama I have ever seen, not NYPD, Third watch or any of the dumb CSI's that have evolved. There is no way that this piece of work could be recreated by anyone other than Anne Bidermen. Stunning is the only word I can find for the show.",1355270400,,569,4.135135135135135

3848767,5,B0025KVKDE,"One of the other reviewers pointed out that these Southland ""seasons"" are
awfully short. This one is seven episodes, and others are only six. However,
the creators do pack a great deal of action into these forty-minute segments.
The pace is a whirlwind in effect, and the many storylines--virtually each
cop has his or her own--provide a lot of content. This isn't a procedural,
obsessed with the facts of the case, like Law and Order or CSI. This is
a drama about the souls of the cops themselves. It's almost spiritual. One
odd aspect of it is seeing C. Thomas Howell, whom we remember from long-ago
kid films, now playing a destructive and irresponsible screw-up cop.",1327968000,3,670,4.7844827586206895

Beats any cop show ever using real examples, strange people, and political drama.  Southland is to cop life as Rescue Me is to firefighting ...if they ever get out of the lazy-chair. :)  I still enjoy season one better than two.  The behind the scenes extra on this DVD set is also nice showing the character development and background ride alongs with real cops.

This is an awesome show and how a Cop show should be done--like The Shield--complicated people doing an unbeliveable job that most of us wouldn't do, getting shot at and crapped on emotionally by the public . The best character by far is Michael Cudlitz (""Bull"" from Band of Brothers)the street Cop who has seen too much, done too much, has no life apart from his job and is spiraling out of control in his personal life. This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott.

I want to see Emmy nominations soon or else there is no justice in this world! This show is a welcomed relief from all of the reality shows and typical comedy sitcoms. The story line between John (Michael Cutlitz and Ben (Ben McKenzie) is particularly fascinating and Lydia's (Regina King) character is one of the few multi-dimensional female characters on TV.

Though season one isn't on par with either of those shows, it showed a lot of potential for greatness and had more than its share of very memorable moments.  It also boasts one of the flashiest documentary-style looks of any drama on television, which doesn't sound like a big deal but really gives the show a unique visual appeal.  Season one is full of great episodes and you can read my full review of the first episode of the new second season here: [...]",1294185600,2,533,4.363636363636363
3848787,5,B0025KVKDE,"This show is in one word amazing! I admit I was first drawn to this because I am a fan of Ben Mckenzie, he played bad boy Ryan Atwood on The O.C, but that is another review. Anyhow after watching I was pleasantly suprised. The action was good and the filming style was even more cool! It appears as if it is like cops where it's another person shooting the footage if that makes sense. It goes into details about the cases, makes you love the characters, and makes you want to keep watching. Great character development! I never lost interest in this show.

I was upset when NBC cancelled it but shortly after it did get picked up by TNT. I think its even better on a cable network. I will continue watching! Season 1 is a must have for anyone who is a fan of this show or someone looking for a new cop drama!",1293753600,,809,4.1528662420382165

To all of the fans who like ""Ryan Francis Atwood"" from ""The O.C.""
(The American television series),
you gonna loooove this one!
After I became addicted to ""The O.C"",
I looked for another T.V series that Benjamin McKenzie Schenkkan
(Ryan Atwood), an amazing actor to my opinion, would play on.
So I bought the complete first season and became impressed again.
I have to say that the service that I got from Amazon was so wonderful,
as always!!
The product was packed so well
and the attention from the service department
was so kind and helpful.",1291248000,3,757,6.20952380952381
3848789,5,B0025KVKDE,"I was disappointed when NBC canceled it, due to the fact they thought it was too graphic for the 9pm slot. I am glad that TNT picked it up and hope they still show it. Southland is about as authentic as a cop show is going to get, it does not glamorize like other shows or show things that the police cannot do (CSI i am looking at you).",1280793600,2,337,3.898550724637681
3848790,5,B0025KVKDE,"This is a really great show about cops. If you like shows Saving Grace, Third Watch, you will love this.",1277856000,2,104,4.25
3848791,5,B0025KVKDE,"Takes police procedurals, urban criminalily and dramatic detective work to new heights in a believable, heart-pounding and fast moving series. Gives viewers a good mix of humor, gangsterism, revenge and human nature that is rarely equalled by most TV shows of this type. I understand that this series was cancelled prematurely and that certainly seems to be the case.  My only quibbles would be the jerky hand held camera and the dimly lit/hard to see night time and indoor scenes.",1277683200,2,481,5.0125
3848792,5,B0025KVKDE,"As a former EMT in an inner city, I experienced much interaction with FD and PD at various scenarios. This series is one of few that reflects the reality of the streets in this type of locale.",1277424000,,192,4.216216216216216

3848795,5,B0025KVKDE,I'm very fussy when it comes to cop shows and this one makes the grade. I'm SO glad TNT picked up this little gem! Looks like they've bought 10 episodes for what I guess will be series 3 to air in 2011.,1274054400,,202,3.8333333333333335
3848796,5,B0025KVKDE,"How in the world did I miss this series when it was on NBC? How in the world could I not buy the first season on DVD? Sure there are only 7 episodes, but they contain enough action and drama to keep you hooked from beginning to end. The storylines echo what you see on the news, and the actors seem to relish the roles they're playing. My favorite moments are the scenes with Officer John Cooper (Michael Cudlitz) and his trainee Ben Sherman (Ben McKenzie). They go through a full range of emotions in the first episode alone, which is so rare, and some of the camera angles make you feel like you're riding along in the back seat with them.

So climb on in and hang on. It's a great ride!",1273536000,,689,4.180451127819549
3848797,5,B0025KVKDE,"The first season was great, unfortunately it was cut short, the second season just finished, again great season. I really hope TNT renews this for a 3rd season. It seems each season thus far has been too short. With all the action/drama that goes on I look forward to getting more. I've already watched this 1st season a few times through, the extended scenes are a nice touch, although they usually don't explain anything extra. Actors are great and seem to really fit their roles. Everything is filmed to give you a more ""real"" experience. ( IE. the camera man actually runs with the actors, sometimes the view is grainy like a home video camera, etc..) Supposedly the stories are based all on real events, some funny, some dramatic. Great series and I hope it continues on.",1270512000,2,776,4.671532846715328
3848798,5,B0025KVKDE,"This is an incredible show and I am so happy TNT has picked this up. Excellent cast, feels like you are right there in all the action... keeps you on the edge of your seat. By far one of the best shows on TV.. now just to hope that TNT orders new episodes to be made... fingers crossed!!!",1267574400,2,288,3.9827586206896552
3848799,5,B0025KVKDE,"Great TV Drama - suspenseful and realistic (especially in the uncensored version).  I hope it keeps getting renewed because it reminds me of the show ""Boomtown"" that was also outstanding, but was dropped probably because people had trouble following the format and twists.",1266969600,,272,5.325581395348837
3848800,5,B0025KVKDE,"I hadn't seen this show on NBC but I remember it being heavily promoted so I bought the DVD.  It's an awesome show, hopefully TNT gets enough petitions to where they'll request additional episodes/full second season, and so on.",1265328000,2,227,4.82051282051282
3848801,4,B0025KVKDE,"I enjoy this show quite a bit, it is both gritty and determined and I think the scripts are strong. Some parts are a bit choppy to watch, but I think that's supposed to add to the realism of it.

I'm personally polling for this show because there are very few shows around that are worth watching these days. My only complaint (besides the sometimes choppily filmed scenes) is that they could have waited until the other 6 episodes were out to make it a more complete set.",1265068800,,472,4.363636363636363
