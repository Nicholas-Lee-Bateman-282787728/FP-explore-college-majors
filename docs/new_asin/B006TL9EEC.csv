5016342,4,B006TL9EEC,"Very informative!  I really wasn't particularly educated on this history and feel that this film did help me understand how the Rothschild family became so wealthy and powerful.  This is an interesting story and I thought the film was actually pretty well preserved, though it's far from a perfect reproduction.",1384128000,,311,5.2
5016343,5,B006TL9EEC,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie and find it inspiring how people who faced racism, persecution, and were ostracized rose above all these obstacles and were able to accumulate wealth, power, and respect despite all the obstacles that were hurled at them.",1371600000,4,251,5.146341463414634
5016344,5,B006TL9EEC,"It is one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I don't think I will ever not want to watch it again.  It is warm, dramatic, humorous, has history, is educational, explains in many ways how to treat one another, and had a beautiful ending.  I very highly recommend it.",1371513600,3,271,4.2745098039215685
5016345,1,B006TL9EEC,Boris Karloff is outstanding well acted and very good film - but I assumed this was another 20th century dvd-r but I was wrong save your money the quality of the product is terrible - copied from a tv print vhs copy maybe worth $5.98 not $15.98 buyer beware.,1367539200,,258,4.285714285714286
5016346,5,B006TL9EEC,"An excellent history lesson and a moving story of relationships in an unstable world.
The scene where Rothschild saves the London Stock Exchange from collapse is a classic.",1367107200,2,172,5.178571428571429
5016347,5,B006TL9EEC,"Contrary to the previous reviews I have found this movie very entertaining and highly recommend it. The only negative aspect to the movie is what I believe to be an accurate depiction of the anti-semitism that was rampant throughout
Europe during the early nineteenth century. From its inception the Jewish banking family of the Rothschilds had to
endure and overcome the bigotry and prejudice that existed. In the end they triumphed and gained respect and the
gratitude that they deserved.  With respect to the quality of the movie itself I was pleasantly surprised by the high<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-House-of-Rothschild/dp/B006TL9EEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The House of Rothschild</a>&nbsp;quality of the film on DVD offered by Amazon.com. It is worth the price.",1357948800,7,818,6.113043478260869
5016348,2,B006TL9EEC,"The two-star rating is not for the movie itself, although I wouldn't rank it much higher than three. I've deducted points for the dreadful print. This homemade DVD is seemingly made from a third- or fourth-generation VHS copy. The image is blurry to the point of inducing headache and eyestrain. Mercifully there were no discernible splices...which means the original, wherever that is, is probably in pretty fair condition.

As for the film itself, it certainly is a ""message"" film: the Jews were downtrodden and put-upon by the rest of the world...but they knew how to deal with money. Stereotypes, of course, but as with all thing stereotypical, they no doubt stem from fact. Karloff has always been one of my favorite actors. His performance is solid...as were all the rest in the cast. He's the meanie of the bunch, of course, dealing behind the Rothschild collective back and then exacting revenge when he's bested by them. The young lovers -- both, coincidentally, named ""Young"": Loretta and Robert -- were a bit ""Hollywood."" The final scene is in very bland color for no particular reason.

I had seen this as a kid back in the 50s on late-night TV, so it was good to see it again. Now if only I could find a decent print of it so I could see it more clearly!",1332374400,3,1267,4.651785714285714
5016349,3,B006TL9EEC,"This interesting early talkie from 1934 is a biopic of Nathan Rothschild, the British-German-Jewish banker from the times of Napoleon that is considered one of the founders of international finance. Rothschild is famous among many things from making a fortune in the London Stock exchange by speculating successfully on Wellington's victory over Napoleon at Waterloo (this is in this film, though apparently according to recent historians it probably never happened).

Rothschild, as portrayed in the film by George Arliss, is not a very likable person: unabashedly ethnocentric (he is adamant that his daughter must not marry a gentile suitor), he is always ready to take offense, views almost every non-Jew as anti-Semitic, is willing to use money to exercise power, etc. Probably because of this, the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels was an unlikely fan of this film, showing an edited version in Germany (that emphasized the most negative aspects of the protagonist) and in 1940 he used an unauthorized clip from this film in the infamous anti-Semitic documentary ""The Eternal Jew"" and also made his own German remake, ""The Rothschild's shares in Waterloo"". The German film, by the way, despite its obvious propaganda intentions, is well made and has a literate, intelligent script. In a way, Rothschild is a more sympathetic character in the German film than in the Hollywood version!

The Hollywood film is also notable for the last scene (in which Rothschild is knighted by the King) being shot in an early Technicolor process.",1327881600,5,1542,5.238866396761134
5016350,5,B006TL9EEC,This is classic.  I cant believe they finally released it.  This movie documents the rise of the rothschilds and the shady ways they took over global control of the world's banking.  The movie is hysterical showing how they pinch every penny and manipulate stock markets and governments... best part is that centuries later these same tricks are still being used against the masses to control them.  must see.,1327795200,3,409,4.970588235294118
8504013,4,B006TL9EEC,"This movie tells the story of the Rothschilds and their motivations for becoming the wealthiest banking family in Europe. George Arliss gives his usual electrifying performance in a dual role as the head of the family and also his eldest son. We watch him as he and the Jews experience caustic anti-Semitism and his efforts to combat it with his wealth and power. The plot is fast-paced and thrilling as Nathan Rothschild manages to outwit his nemesis, played by a diabolical Boris Karloff. Above all, I liked Nathan's belief that with great wealth comes great responsibility and the duty to use it to achieve peace.",1497657600,,616,4.876190476190477

8504015,5,B006TL9EEC,Excellent movie,1424131200,,15,7.0
8504016,5,B006TL9EEC,"This film is classic Hollywood, a pure propaganda play that utterly rewrites history to serve the Jewish mindset that created it.  Of course Nathan Rothschild is the super hero that saves the day, with unyielding moral principles devoted to the common good of all humanity!  It's not about making obscene quantities of money or exercising power and control over others in the selfish pursuit of more power and control (aka ""money"").  It's not about profiting from war by loaning funds to both sides so that no matter the victor, all loans are repaid with heavy interest.  It's not about deceiving others to crash the London stock exchange so that you can buy everything for pennies on the dollar.  No, it's about funding war to establish peace, about creating a banking monopoly to free the Jews from unwarranted discrimination, about the bonds of family love and compassion for the human race.  If you wonder how the media industry could possibly brainwash entire populations, you need only study this one film.  This is how it's done.  Nathan even brings the entire world into living color at the film's end thanks to his copious empathy and magnanimous humanity.  Warm and fuzzy, you bet!  Historically accurate and truthful, get outa here!",1419206400,,1243,4.961352657004831
