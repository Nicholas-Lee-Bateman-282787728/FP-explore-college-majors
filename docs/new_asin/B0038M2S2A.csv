4086972,5,B0038M2S2A,"Our local library had a couple of individual shows from Season 1.  After watching those, we quickly turned to Amazon to purchase the Season 1 compilation.  Then, later, also Season 2, 3, and 4.  Yes, admittedly, my family and I are addicted. We watch episodes again and again. (Amazon: sign us up to receive seasons 5 thru 999, too, whenever they're released.) Fascinating characters. Great story lines.  Beautiful scenery.  And, Clunes' ""Ellingham"" (""Doc Martin"") character is brash, offensive, and humorous in a unusual sort of way. (Think of the genius of John Cleese in ""Fawlty Towers"" -- but, without the self-effacing humor and slapstick.)  Hard to describe, really.  In short, take a chance: buy it!  Suggest you start with Season 1 if only to watch the subtle, but brilliant, character-development unfold. Possibly, one of the best things ever to come out of English TV.  Bravo!",1280448000,12,886,5.055172413793104
4086973,5,B0038M2S2A,"This marvelous 4th season picks up where Season 3 left off and I couldn't be more thrilled.  The loons are back in town!

This is British comedy at its best: quirky characters, unique plot twists, and gorgeous scenery leave you alternately chuckling and shaking your head incredulously.

If one egocentric but brilliant physician is good, why not two?  An old flame of Doc Martin's surfaces with a predatory gleam in her eye whilst the charming but oft bewildered Louisa faces a new challenge to her love for Doc Martin and an unanticipated complication.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Titchell, the chemist (pharmacist), still burns with an unreciprocated crush that's hilariously optimistic.

I could eat this series with a spoon and wait impatiently for each new season.  Apparently there are episodes released in Britain that are unavailable here in the States. I saw Martin Clunes on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and learned there are more seasons being filmed even as I write this.  So where is Season 5?????

This series is a delightful experience I want to enjoy again and again.",1280361600,28,1073,4.98314606741573

4086975,5,B0038M2S2A,"Okay, I am addicted to Doc Martin, having purchased the complete series.  Season Four does not disappoint.  If anything, it's even better than its predecessors (if that can be possible).

With only a couple of changes in casting, the usual zany crew return for this fourth season.  In addition to Doc Martin (played superbly by character actor Martin Clunes), who has NO interpersonal relationship skills, there is the lovely Louisa Klassen, played by Catherine Catz, plumber turned restauranteur Bert Large, ably played by Ian McNeice, Auntie Joan (Stephanie Cole) and a list of talented others.

Doc is grumpier than usual since Louisa has departed, but a surprise meeting with a former colleague turns up the heat.  Then Louisa returns with a not-so-secret secret.  Auntie Joan has financial problems and turns her farm into a B & B which adds to the problem.  Doc plans to return to surgery and works to overcome his hemophobia, and Edith (played by Lia Williams) plans a little seduction.

The charmingly bucolic Portwenn (in real life Port Isaac) is a delight.

As with each episode throughout the series, it is highly recommended that you view them in order as one episode builds on the previous.

This is entertainment at its best.  Don't miss it!",1279584000,6,1255,4.952153110047847

4086977,5,B0038M2S2A,"This series is so great.  The writing, acting, etc. are all top notch.  The characters of this charming seaside town are eccentric and very endearing.  Sometimes laugh out loud funny, sometimes touching, but always superb!",1279238400,4,222,5.285714285714286

4086979,5,B0038M2S2A,"FUN LOL BRITISH COMEDY. If you've not experienced DOC MARTIN prior, get every series now. Series 4 picks right up with the dramatic falling apart of a wedding ceremony from the ending of Series 3. So what can get worse? Everything. About the only thing that compares to the eccentric characters in Portwenn is way back to Mayberry RFD. Is Portwenn a British Mayberry? May-be! It's Cornwall corny. And also a Cornwall (filmed in Port Isaac) beautiful quaint fishing port.

Every weird local is back for Series 4. Rude, grumpy Doc (Martin Clunes) still gags at blood; Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole) is poorer thus less sane; teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz) has an obvious situation; receptionist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny wanting a man, maybe Large Jr., son of Bert Large (Ian McNeice)plumber turned chef (ugh, don't order the soup); and newcomer Edith (Lia Williams)in charge of romantic mayhem. That's just the short-list of a crazy cast that keeps a tapestry of sub-plots moving fast.

A great family series, which does have a 'graphic medical scene' warning due to numerous accidents involving some blood for Doc Martin to gag or spew from. A surgeon afraid of blood is just part of the absurd humor. If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this will do & make you beg for more. Episodes carry over to the next and all with SUBTITLES. Some of the best British Doctor Comedy/Drama ever produced.

Need more evidence of greatness? Episode details:
1 BETTER THE DEVIL-Louisa left Portwenn & Doc is out-grouching his own sour records. Doc's ex-girlfriend from med school arrives. Will he soon be London bound? His blood phobia may decide.

2 UNEASY LIES THE HEAD-Louisa returns (much heavier) and town tongues tell tales. She doesn't want Martin involved. Edith becomes Louisa's doctor. Aunt Joan sides with Louisa & tells Doc to do right by her. The school headmaster acts stranger than the routine eccentric of Portwenn.

3 PERISH TOGETHER AS FOOLS-Local copper's bro is ill. There is romance all about--but not what you expect. Doc shows a rare sign of tenderness with seeing the baby scan.

4 DRIVING MR McLYNN-Louisa wants to be school head again, Joan needs money, & Doc tells Edith he applied for a surgery position but...what about the blood?

5 THE DEPARTED-Doc falsifies his blood fear problem in a surgery job interview. Doc's newly widowed patient is talking with her departed. A mental problem? Not uncommon for Portwenn. Joan gets sued.

6 MIDWIFE CRISIS-A midwife & Doc disagree on Louisa's care. Joan is told of Doc's new London job but who should tell Louisa? Bert's restaurant has a new cook, followed by an emergency.

7 DO NOT DISTURB-Word gets out the Doc is leaving Portwenn. Doc accompanies Edith to a conference but it ends differently than expected. Joan starts taking in B&B guests-paying guests.

8 THE WRONG GOODBYE-Doc's last day at Portwenn includes abundant patients, too many expressions of affection, Edith wanting an apology, Aunt Joan's on his back over his unborn baby, and...oh dear, an emergency at an emergency.

Bottom line recommendation: By all means watch it, but after Series 1, 2, & 3. Once you see Series 4, if not already owned, you WILL buy the others. Might as well watch them in order. Treat yourself. Laughter is good medicine.",1273968000,108,3319,4.951438848920863

In season 4 Doc Martin became more boarish after a failed marriage ceremony.

Doc's deepening antisocial behavior including dog kicking is getting a bit stale along with continual miscommunication with the teacher.  I'm hoping the next season will introduce some new creative approaches to the characters and the stories.,1434412800,,417,5.287878787878788

But this hasn't been a dust collector.  I got all the series to date and it is enjoyable to watch if you want to relax or eat with company.  The show itself took awhile to gain popularity but once it did everyone seemed to have started watching it.  It is timeless yet set in the current period.  The acting is excellent, the story lines are funny, touching and well thought out.  Individual episodes stand alone very well.  It is set in a calming place with great photography of the area.  It you are used to all the fast moving plot lines and lots of noise, this isn't for you (unless you want a pleasant change of pace).  But I enjoy it and it has regulars from teens to the elderly.

The poor man is deeply locked into rigid focus on being a doctor, at all times and all places, an affliction that renders him deeply socially incompetent, even in the face of Louisa's valiant and enduring attempts to search out the man she hopes to love - the one hopelessly buried in that rigid shell.

A most unusual premis.  I also like the fact that each show is only 45 min long.  Just enough to watch in the later evening.",1397174400,,215,4.195121951219512

4088020,5,B0038M2S2A,"I love Doc Martin but this season is the best.  It has him caught up in a love triangle and finally dealing with his hemophobia and is consistently hilarious - not that the other seasons aren't.  I've watched Doc Martin from the beginning but if you're not a regular, give season 4 a try and see if you don't get hooked!",1397088000,,320,4.229508196721311

Much to my delight it was wonderful. It is funny but serious all the cast work to be who they need to be. Some times you want to help Doc show his true feelings but the show works because he can't. I also think British shows are 100% better than American. Sorry American producers, writers, and actors I know you can do it but you are relieing .on so much action.gunfights and f_words you think that's all we want to see. Put a story in your shows.",1397001600,,603,4.07563025210084

4088044,4,B0038M2S2A,It is an interesting series. It has a whole community of nitwits. I love the tolerance for all the different personalities in this community. They don't have a sense of doing any job very well. That seems to be where our society is headed.,1396828800,,239,4.454545454545454
4088045,5,B0038M2S2A,I love the Doc Martin series.  It doesn't matter which one it is.  I would rate them all 5 stars!  You either love it or hate it!  I like the way Doc Martin plays the role.  Very direct and to the point.  He has no time for nonsense.  I do think he needs to be just a little bite more sensitive. Beautiful  location for the series.,1396828800,,331,3.909090909090909

4088050,5,B0038M2S2A,"Terrific series. Like movies SHOULD be. Compare this to The Wolf of Wall STreet (just watched that last night - ugggghhhh! What a piece of trash!). Whereas this movie has character buildup, relationship connections, drama, and beauty, all wrapped up in one package. I don't understand why it takes the Brits to make good, lasting movies, whereas our modern Hollywood produces garbage nowadays. Anyway, This series is delightful.",1396656000,,428,5.3088235294117645
4088051,5,B0038M2S2A,"Doc Martin is the epitome of gruff, with no time to waste on fools. His love life is practically non-existent, but his assertive manner attracts several female admirers. Which he hardly notices. The range of characters he encounters is astounding, but show a slice of life in Cornwall we would never have known.",1396569600,,311,4.886792452830188
4088052,5,B0038M2S2A,"I was hesitant about watching Doc Martin because one never knows which way the humor is going to go.  I think Monty Python is hilarious but Benny Hill was just disgusting.  Doc Martin had me from the first episode I watched with my wife.  If only we could react to situations as the doctor does without people thinking you're being the bully.  Straight forward and sometimes ""cold"" but he never is uninteresting.  His relationship with Louisa is complicated and I often wonder why she lingers in the relationship.  Wonderful casting of the townspeople.  Dogs are wonderfully insightful and despite his foibles and social ineptness the dogs in the show are wonderfully loyal to him which says musch about how the writers characterize the Doc.  Thoroughly enjoyable and addicting.  Just a thought: Lots of character similarities to Sheldon in CBS' Big Bang Theory.",1396569600,,862,5.014084507042254

4088056,5,B0038M2S2A,"It's hard to understand how I could develop such an interest in someone so irascible. I think many viewers instinctively understand how someone so reactive has been on the receiving end of so much verbal abuse and also get his misinterpretations of feelings of others. Still, he cares so much about rescuing and healing people.",1396396800,,327,4.963636363636364

I miss all of the characters.  They are all quirky and loveable.  I want Martin and Louisa to work out their marital problems and with little James live happily ever after.

4088073,5,B0038M2S2A,"Doc Martin has a blood phobia, and he had to give up surgery in a big London Hospital.  So, he moves to a small fishing village to become a family doctor and the entertainment began.  It is Louisa - Caroline Cats is the 'real' reason I have watched the series 10 times over.  The chemistry between the Doc and Louisa is often so good I must remind my self that they are acting.

Louisa is a Service to Others people person - Doc has Asperger's, really does not like people but is extremely dedicated to helping sick people.  He is rude, brash, sometimes down right nasty and like a five year old kid, says exactly what is on his mind and won't apologise.

Yet, Doc has one weakness' - he loves Louisa, but has no idea how to treat her.  Louisa loves the Doc, knows it is a sceptic relationship, and in spite of her better judgement, love wins out every time.  Makes for damn good entertainment, if you like that sort of thing.

I've watched all series, and recently S6 - E1-8 and found them wanting s- too far fetched and if the new writers don't get S7 right, diehards like me will switch off.",1395964800,,1094,4.271844660194175

Now we are awaiting the next season which won't be out until 2015.  The current season - season six - is just wrapping up on TV.  We have tired to find something to replace this series but so far no good.  The character developed through the series, the laughs, and tears pull you in and keep you there.  The acting is superior, especially Martin Clunes.  We both loved and hated him and then found ourselves filled with pity for him.  It makes a statement to parents on the effects of how you raise your child...the devastating consequences for that child's life possibly forever.

It's hard to beliieve that a man can be that unaware of other people's feelings, but even while he is annoying you, you find yourself feeling sorry for him.  The sexual and emotional tension between him and Louisa is wonderful.  The characters of the village are both charming and amusing.

4088163,5,B0038M2S2A,"This is for all the seasons of Doc Martin.  The scripts are superb.  Martin Clunes fits the role of Doc Martin to a ""T""!  He is blunt to the point of no return, and funny at the same time.  He also teaches medicine with the variety of complaints the people of the small town seem to have.  The characters are all well played.  The viewer is caught up in the day-to-day life of the people and the daily ""trials"" of Doc Martin.  Slowly Doc Martin becomes more ""human"" as the series goes on.  This is definitely a ""keeper"" as British TV shows go.",1393804800,,543,4.203883495145631

4088167,5,B0038M2S2A,Endlessly humorous situations engulf the eccentric townfolk of Portwenn (Port Isaac) Cornwall with the good Doc squarely in the middle of the madness.  You may need subtitles so you can catch all the subtle humor in the distinctively Cornish accents.  We hope Season 6 will not be the last.,1393632000,,290,4.8979591836734695

4088174,5,B0038M2S2A,"We started viewing Doc Martin, the no-nonsense British doctor in a picturesque sea-side resort, as a lesser evil on a rainy afternoon. But the range of quirky and lovable characters addicted us to the series and we now cannot get enough of it. The main character is based on Conan Doyle, who claims that he knew a medical doctor who could diagnose a patient instantly on watching him behave and walk for five minutes. This series is a parallel to ""Sherlock"", but more down to earth and homely.
For American audiences it should be of interest that Doc Martin's medical practice does not handle money, bills, credit cards or any kind of monetary instrument, because all patients are covered and well served by Britain' s National Health Service, universal and single payer. It is Television, but reality based.",1393372800,,808,4.86231884057971
4088175,5,B0038M2S2A,"I would watch this show solely for the lovely scenery and the quaint British village scenes.  Martin Clunes is delightfully perverse as the Doc and invites comparisons with another Britisher, Hugh Laurie (as Greg House, M.D.).  The romantic interest between the Doc and the charming and attractive local schoolmarm is wonderful.  The small town characters are eclectic and often hilarious, especially the local plumber/restaurateur, Burt Large.  What is not to love about this series that just keeps giving season after season.  Truly addictive.",1393286400,,545,5.518072289156627

4088207,5,B0038M2S2A,"Doc Martin is another wonderful PBS series.  Dr. Ellingham, called Doc Martin by the locals, is an extremely intelligent man with no bedside manner. At times he seems rude and arrogant, but he devotes himself to improving health and saving lives in a small coastal village. Only gradually do we find out about his narcissistic parents and a childhood marred by a lack of true affection.  We pull for him to find love, intimacy, and empathy that was so missing in his childhood. Infused with humor, we also cheer on the local folks as well. The acting is very fine.",1392768000,,564,4.63

4088221,5,B0038M2S2A,"I cannot say why it is addictive, perhaps it is the scenery, perhaps it is the lilting Cornish accent, certainly the characters.

4088318,5,B0038M2S2A,"Doc Martin is delightfully idiosyncratic. He says it as he sees it and doesn't understand why people embellish reality. It makes it more touching when he shows affection towards Louiza and we can see how he cares. I'm not sure, in the end. that will be enough for their relationship, but it is both funny and toughing to watch. Martin Clunes is marvelous. When he is out of character he is a completely different man. The rest of residents of Port Wenn are as equally wonderful to watch.",1389830400,,487,4.545454545454546

4088342,5,B0038M2S2A,"I love the show, it is funny and tear inducing at times and the acting is wonderful. The expressions on the Doctor's face are usually priceless and even though he is an extremely rude person with no bedside manner for a doctor, it is easy to sympathize with him knowing of his loveless childhood. I was sad to learn in the following season that Auntie Joan was no longer in the show because she was the one person who seemed to understand Martin and his problems more than anyone and their interaction was wonderful.  Some people may find his character difficult to respond to because of his rudeness but I feel it is that part of his nature that makes his character more interesting and fun to watch. One of my favorite shows, and the scenery is breathtaking.",1389830400,,760,4.507246376811594

4088356,4,B0038M2S2A,"I love the Doc Martin series, but the first three years were the best.  At least he had some redeeming qualities that makes us understand why Louisa loves him.  In the later episodes, all he does is 'bark'.  Makes you wonder why anyone puts up with him.  Also, Pauline, his receptionist in Seasons 2 & 3 is a kick.  When she leaves, a bit more charm of the series has also left.  If you look at the first season, you'll see Doc Martin smile now and then and have a softer side.  In Season 4 not so much, and Season 5 is worse.  I'm hoping Season 6 will put the series back on track - haven't viewed that yet.  Come on, Doc, ease up and go back to being quirky and cute!",1389139200,,669,4.007575757575758

4088359,5,B0038M2S2A,"Port Wenn, in Cornwall, England (actually Port Isaac) is a small, very picturesque town full of the zaniest characters you could ever find.  Doc Martin is a very capable doctor, but his irascibility tends to put off most of his fellow townspeople.  Some, though, look beyond his curmudgeonly ways, realizing that his medical skill borders on genius.  I highly recommend each of the six seasons of the series, which you should watch from the very beginning of Season 1.  There has been talk of a seventh season, which I hope turns out to be true.",1389139200,,545,4.705263157894737

4088387,5,B0038M2S2A,"I have always enjoyed British television, from New Tricks to Downton Abbey. Doc Martin is no exception. It is a look at Cornish life with a lot of humor and great character development. As I watch the different episodes and seasons, I alternately love, pity, and feel exasperated at Martin. The story lines are interesting and the cinematography is exceptional. Having been to Cornwall, it truly reflects the ruggedness and beauty of that part of the world.

I highly recommend this series. I didn't realize until going onto Amazon Prime that we were three seasons behind in the States. We watched season 4 and 5, and then paid the $14.99 for season 6. Now I'm hoping they produce a season 7 so we're not left hanging!",1388707200,,718,4.698412698412699

Ben Bolt's direction is superb.  I have previously reviewed Seasons 1 through 3 of this series, and still give it five stars.  Martin Clunes is fairly amazing as the title character--his body language and expressions convey far more than his words ever could.  This is understated comedy, as well as high drama, at its very best.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoy each episode, always picking up on something new when we re-watch any one.  There are no ""normal"" people in Port Wenn (the fictional town where the series is set), but then, that's what makes Doc Martin so endearing and watchable--there are no ""normal"" people in the real world, as we all have our idiosyncrasies and hang-ups, whether or not the world ever knows.

The writers of this series have given us a view of a town, a different sort of character and wrapped it up in a comedy series that delights.

I was watching an episode a night and was up to the Wedding at the end of Series 3, when 3, 4, and 5 were gone from Netflix.  This made me angry no end.  It took me a couple of months until I found series 3, 4, and 5 on Amazon Prime Video as part of my Prime membership.

over-the-top serious and yet very funny at the same time. His relationship with his baby's mother is complicated and hysterical!

What makes this show compelling is that Doc Martin is evolving, that the people of the village, while annoying the bejesus out of him are forcing him to grow. And the fact is that he genuinely cares about them, he just doesn't know how to express his feelings (as he sees them as irrelevant to his job).

4088728,4,B0038M2S2A,"Still enjoyed the series through season four, but the writers should have developed the character of Doc Martin (Ellingham) by making him a lot more human by now.  A highly educated and skilled former surgeon talking and acting like a caveman got old and should have been improved upon.  That was my biggest complaint about the series, besides there being so few episodes per season. A little less tea and a lot more work could have produced many more episodes.

If you love British comedies, you will fall hard for this series - there are so many entertaining characters.  And the quaint and beautiful Cornwall town is like a mini-vacation from a stressful day.
But the best is to see this man with barely any social skills try to show his love for the town schoolteacher - it is a marvel to see his face soften only when he looks at her.
I couldn't wait to find out what happened between Martin & Luisa so I jumped ahead to Series 4 & 5 (it does not disappoint!) - so now I'm going back in time to Series 1.",1373587200,,759,4.156462585034014

It's easy to go from episode to episode with my Amazon Prime instant streaming, which I think is just great.

The supporting characters--Aunt Joan, Pauline, Burt and Al--are all likeable and not drawn on stereotypes. The main story revolves around the very formal Doc and his romance with Louise, a local teacher.  The setting is a coastal town in Cornwall overlooking a shore.

I really like his Aunt Joan and Louisa however and maybe if Martin cleans up his act and treats his patients a bit better and is a bit more friendly-like, he and everyone else in Portwenn would get on a lot better.

Martin meets a former girlfriend while he is in medical school - who in many ways acts a lot like him - expecting him to meet her needs. As a result, he begins seeking a job back in surgery, including working with a therapist to overcome his blood aversion.

Louisa shows up pregnant - with Martin's child. Martin has difficulty dealing with the situation, including her desire to continue working

Bert Large's situation deteriorates at the restaurant he opens in spite of it turning around with new customers

It climaxes with an accident that puts Louisa and the baby at risk, and makes Martin begin to question his desire to leave her and the baby.

4089159,5,B0038M2S2A,"Barely two months after I first viewed the first episode, ""Doc Martin"" has now become one of my favorite productions ever, movie or television.  In fact, it's hard to think of a better production that I've seen in decades of television and movie viewing -- the outstanding comedy and drama of ""Doc Martin"" are that good.  Five stars are hardly enough for a program that produces this kind of enjoyment.

I've now watched all of the currently existing episodes through Series 5, and in my opinion, ""Doc Martin"" sustains its very high level of quality throughout, so I'd recommend the DVDs of all of the seasons.  I can hardly wait for Series 6, which star Martin Clunes has confirmed will be filmed in 2013 and will likely be the last series for the program.

For the uninitiated, the premise of the show is that the rather grouchy, socially inept but brilliant Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) is taking over as a general practitioner in the picturesque seaside village of Portwenn in southwestern England, after leaving his London surgical practice when he develops a blood phobia.  Schoolteacher Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz) is one of the few villagers who appreciates Martin's good qualities -- she understands that his social rudeness disguises a man who actually cares for other people in a very literal way.  A romance results, creating a running thread through all of the seasons, although there are significant setbacks along the way.

Martin and Louisa are joined by plumber/restauranteur Bert Large (Ian McNeice) and his son/business partner Al (Joe Absolom); Martin's Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole), who runs a small, struggling family farm by herself; later on, Martin's Aunt Ruth (Dame Eileen Atkins), a psychiatrist; a series of quirky receptionists in the doctor's office, with Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) as the longest-serving and most memorable; the village pharmacist, Mrs. Tishell (Selina Cadell), who has a lasting crush on Martin; and two successive village police officers, Mark Mylow (Stewart Wright) and Joe Penhale (John Marquez), who share some well-meaning comic ineptitude with Mayberry's Barney Fife.

Both the acting and the writing on ""Doc Martin"" contain considerable depth.  My wife and I knew we were seeing something unusually good when, after each episode, we began discussing the characters' motivations, how their family backgrounds affected their personalities, and what those characters might have been doing while they were off-stage as a logical prelude to their on-stage actions.  Now, obviously, we know that these are fictional characters who don't really have family backgrounds and aren't really doing anything when they're not in a scene.  But the actors and the writers have created characters with so many dimensions that there is something very real about them -- it makes the viewer care about what they're going through now and wonder what's going to happen to them next.  To me, this is the ultimate success for a dramatic production: to create its own reality, one that the audience cares about.  All of the actors noted above and, of course, the writers have a great deal to be proud of here.

As you might guess, almost every program contains medical problems for Martin to deal with, ranging from routine but sometimes funny ailments to life-threatening emergencies -- that's the life of the only doctor in a small village.  But this isn't really a show about medicine, even though the main character is a medical doctor, it's a comedy/drama about a wide variety of people with a wide variety of things going on in their lives -- from Aunt Joan's financial problems on the farm to the Larges' business setbacks to the romantic yearnings of PC Mark Mylow.  But although the group of characters (and actors) here is outstanding, I wouldn't call this a true ensemble drama, because the series focuses on Martin, who is undoubtedly the main character -- this is his story, even though the other characters' stories are told as well.  As the show progresses, Louisa comes to share that focus because her relationship with Martin becomes so important to the show.  In this aspect, there's a certain similarity to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I think, because both stories involve a romance, long in developing, between a very good-natured, sensible, and highly competent woman and a rather rude, haughty, but worthwhile man who needs someone to humanize him.  Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz constantly impress with the meaning they bring to these roles with their brilliantly subtle characterizations.  Small, almost unnoticed expressions often convey worlds of feeling.

(The Martin-Louisa romance has really caught the public imagination, apparently.  In an LA Times interview, Martin Clunes says that ""[a] boy came up and asked me for my autograph, followed by an old man who said, 'I don't want your autograph but just marry that girl before I die, willya?' That seems to sum up the level at which it hits people."")

But I'm not trying to downplay the other characters, and the excellent actors who portray them.  They're all a very important part of this show's considerable charm, and they all have their turns (sometimes numerous turns) as the center of different subplots in particular episodes.  These subplots can be either comic or dramatic for particular characters, rather than being only one or the other, again showing the depth of the writing and acting.  For example, Bert and Al Large, who are usually involved in rather funny situations, also deal with more serious family issues and business problems. PC Joe Penhale, a classic well-meaning bumbler, also has a sad encounter with his ex-wife.  And even when a character doesn't have his/her own plotline, that person very ably supports the characters who do.

While there's certainly a good deal of drama in these programs, the laughs shouldn't be overlooked.  The Larges, the police officers, the receptionists, and Mrs. Tishell all provide much humor -- as does Martin himself, whose disdainful reactions to the villagers are often very funny.

This story of an emotionally stunted man has the potential to create an abundance of emotion in its audience, because most viewers, I think, will care about these characters, laughing at their foibles and commiserating with their sorrows.  I give it my highest recommendation.  I would guess that most people who see just a few of the early episodes will, like me, want to see all of them, perhaps multiple times.",1346889600,,6482,5.09640831758034
4089160,5,B0038M2S2A,Excellent series.  Esy to download.  Enjoyable and hard to stop at one episode as a marathon watch is great.  The characters draw you in and are consistent from one episode to the next.  They make you want to know them better.,1341619200,,226,4.439024390243903

I am so happy there is a baby to make things really interesting in the next series.  This has to make Doc Martin melt away his stern exterior.  How can he be so rigid when he lives in the most beautiful setting on the planet?  I am totally enthralled with this series.  The British really know how to create a great show that leaves you wanting it to last forever. I am a fan!,1339977600,,522,4.442105263157894
4089192,5,B0038M2S2A,"Some people do not understand why they love this series nor understand why they love Doc Martin. Some dedicated viewers really don't quite understand why they are so hooked! So I shall tell them why they love Doc Martin. Doc Martin is real. I am a registered nurse and have worked in the Operating Room (theater, if you are picky) and I can tell you this man exists. That is why I switched to the Medical Floor, to get away from the Doc Martins of the hospital. Good grief, they are intimidating! It takes years to find out how weak and vulnerable and sad they are. When a patient codes and doesn't make it, the Doc Martins of the world are left to handle their grief and feelings alone. Isn't that sad? We notice (and love) Doc Martin first of all because he oozes alpha male chemistry and we react to that with a mixture of love and hate, contempt and admiration. We love him second of all because he has transcended most of his feelings (unlike us) and has thus moved to a higher plane of capability and we benefit greatly from his increased capability and confidence. We love him thirdly because he needs our love and he has been so mistreated and has such voids within him. There are all kind of subtle clues that Doc Martin is wonderful, but none so telling as the fact that dogs love him and are not impressed by his screams and sneers. You cannot fool a dog! Why does America love this series so much? Because the British do a much finer job than we do at so many many film endeavors. From the impeccable casting to the brilliant writing and believable dialogue to the ability the British have to plumb the depths and soar the heights of human drama and comedy without having holes and gaps that need filled with obscenity or worse. Thanks to the British for their genius. They are even brilliant in the way they use color to match the characters to the environment and create an ambiance that disarms the viewer. I love British films and ""Doc Martin"" best of all. I suspect another reason America is enthralled with the Doc Martin series is because we Americans are having socialized medicine crammed down our unwilling throats, and watching socialized medicine in action adds a certain little touch of horror spice to the story that Brits probably do not even notic",1339545600,3,2275,4.497584541062802

4089198,5,B0038M2S2A,"Five Bright Gold Stars! ""Doc Martin Series 4"" hits the exact mark of gently humorous pathos needed at critical turning points in the lives of these characters. It is neither ""hilarious"" nor ""depressing"" to me. This is not for viewers looking for a gag-a-minute slapstick or ""a show about nothing"". Taking the long view over the entire series, you will find that ""Doc. Martin"" is a meaningful comedy. I disagree with some reviewers that the characters are ill-tempered and diminished in Series 4. They face serious difficulties (an important element of classic comedy.) Like real people, they suffer bravely and do the best they can. We see Martin stumble painfully through his star-crossed communications. And we see the characters grow. I came to admire them more by the end of Series 4. Yes, there is still genuine humor (the unexpected and incongruous events, inventive dialogue, plots, patients, and maladies). In classic comedy, believable conflict is required before the happy ending. The writers provide this in Series 4. I think it's masterful.

They left us the audience waiting at the church with the rest of the village, and we can wait forever, because there isn't going to be any happiness for Doc and Louisa.  (I peeked.  There's a further series that cements Doc's existential loneliness, but I won't be watching it).  Cruelty:  the hideous visual joke that on Doc's wedding day, the closest he gets to having sex is poking his finger in a pig's rectum and pulling it out with crap all over it.  Ha Ha Ha Ha.  On this day Doc and Louisa are the closest they will ever get to having children  -  when they are together between another woman's legs as she delivers.  Ha Ha Ha.  In fact, Doc looks at other people's butts all day on his wedding day, but at the end of the day he has no wife to look at.  Ha Ha Ha.  And for good measure, on this special day Bert and Al find the assurance they need  -  to know they are losers and give up their dream.  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.

I say the gods of Doc Martin are not only cruel, they are WRONG.  The reason we care about people, the reason we hope for redemption, is because THAT IS THE WAY IT REALLY IS.  There is a God, and he loves us.  He has provided a way of redemption, healing, and transformation for us through Jesus Christ.

I'm telling myself a different ending for Martin and Louisa's story.  Their creators did a great job of giving us real characters that we care about.  Then they stuck a knife in us and gave it a twist.  May they and all of us find the redemption we need.",1294099200,4,1817,4.146551724137931

Initially, I purchased Set 1 to see what all the hoora was about. Instantly, I was hooked.
Immediately,I ordered sets 2,3, and 4 and thoroughly enjoyed each and every incident in each episode.
I have introduced Doc Martin to my sisters, my Husband and my friends. We totally enjoy each character
in village Portwenn and the Beautiful scenery (Portwenn / Port isaac).
I review each episode numerous times each day AND each episode continues to bring forth pleasure and
enjoyment for me and family.  !!! WE want SERIES 5 NOW !!!  PLEASE continue producing DOC Martin !!!

We feel that DOC MARTIN is the only TV Series that is more enjoyable than ""Last of the Summer Wine""
AND will certainly become the LONGEST RUNNING TV SERIES of ALL TIMES.

4089263,5,B0038M2S2A,"I've never watched an episode of ""Lost"", or ""Survivor anywhere"", nor did I ever watch ""Dallas"", ""Dynasty"", or, cutting to the chase, any TV series with a continuing story line. Over the past few years I've not watched TV dramas or comedies unless they were in re-runs, convenient (pre bed or dinner) and funny- Third Rock from the Sun...early episodes of Scrubs..etc.  My TV viewing has essentially been limited to PBS, History and/or History International, Natl Geographic and Discovery Science PROVIDED THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY of a reference to  Aliens, Nostradamus, or Mayan Prophecy, a provision which has significantly diminished my TV exposure.

Yesterday, I watched the entire fourth season of Doc Martin start to finish.  I did that because the night before, I stayed up watching the third season. I only recently discovered this show as I channel surfed onto PBS 4-5 weeks ago. I saw the first episode, came home early to watch the second, and then learned how to watch ON Demand for first time when I missed the third.  This is the first TV show to involve me in its characters the way a great, ""cannot put it down"" book can. It's almost embarrassing....no, it is embarrassing. I really can't explain why, but if you need a ""hook"", I'll promise this:  if you watch all the episodes, at some point you will see the most authentic, accurate, believable-yet unquestionably unique- explicit sex scene (involving one of the main characters), ever to appear on PBS, and quite possibly Network TV. How it does so while eliciting empathy and avoiding prurience is probably as good an explanation as I can conceive to explain my enjoyment of this show/series.",1290816000,10,1671,4.9288256227758005

4089265,5,B0038M2S2A,"This review is for series 4 of the Doc Martin program from the UK. It picks up several months after series 3 ended with the failed wedding and all that.

As one reviewer commented, the writing in this series may not have been quite as good as in previous ones. But, I still say it is worth 5 stars.

One of the characters turns up pregnant. An old girl friend of the Doc shows up in the area. The Doc works on his fear of blood and applies for a job in London. In the last episode, he is on his way to London behind the moving trucks when there is an accident. Hard to say what he will do next when this episode ends. There will be a series 5, but it has not filmed yet, so we will have to wait to see.

There seemed to be a lot less of Bert and Al Large and some of the more minor regular characters in this series which is a pity - they are all so good in the program.

Looking forward to series 5.",1290729600,,900,3.8225806451612905

4089267,5,B0038M2S2A,"I loved this series and just hope that they will produce Series Five!  The scenery is fabulous and the characters are lovable, even Doc Martin who alienates the town's people, but comes through whenever needed.  It is a great story.",1287360000,,232,4.775
4089268,5,B0038M2S2A,We loved watching the entire series. I wish there were more episodes. The characters are quirky.  The setting is lovely and I have seen it now on google earth.  Doc Martin remains socially inept but very bright with a diagnosis.,1287014400,,228,4.675
4089269,3,B0038M2S2A,"Possible spoiler.

It's not like I wanted a totally happy ending. One of the wonderful joys of this show is how unexpected behavior and plot have been. But the characters personalities were written worse and worse! Auntie has gone from arrogant and abrasive to worse plus a hint of dementia. Also so unfeeling about all Martin has done for her. The PC is crazy, Bert and his son are stale, the pharmacist is making a tedious fool of herself, they've even spoiled Pauline in this series: she's as nasty as the rest now. I don't blame the Doc in the least for giving her a mediocre reference. She got the job anyway, didn't she? Louisa could save the relationship with some humor and love, but instead is either tongue-tied or ridiculously belligerent and incredibly hurtful. Martin gets nastier at the same time he continues his medical miracles.

If I could talk to the show's writers, I'd say enough of the conflicts generated by nasty female behavior! That has been a constant plot device throughout the show, and is common on many shows. I re-watched the pilot last night: give us our old Doc Martin back! The dialogue was much better, funnier. He was an emotional challenge already, and the townsfolk have now driven him mad. His sadness is very hard to watch, and he's not equipped to deal. He doesn't get any relief, and I am all worn out by watching this. My husband feels the same way. We got to dread each episode, but kept hoping it would redeem itself. There were some excellent moments amidst the madness. But no belly laughs at all.

One thing I love about the show is the Doc's consistent honesty, extreme work ethic and intelligence. He takes his job very seriously, and you often see him help someone he detests or who resists treatment or even wishes him harm. However, while it is an excellent device to have a character at once so competent and so easy to humiliate, that can go too far. And is there anyone else in the whole village, beside Louisa, who is intelligent and competent?? Is there anyone there who values intelligence and competence? Perhaps it is more like real life than I want it to be!

I've read that they are going to film series 5 in 2011. I will watch it, and hope they can recover everything wonderful about this show.",1285200000,38,2259,4.57037037037037
4089270,5,B0038M2S2A,I came across Doc Martin DVD's when I was looking for a comedy series and came up with a real winner. I now own all of the series.

4089301,5,B0038M2S2A,"For those who love BBC series and who like a show that challenges their brains and their hearts, this is a great choice.

4089304,5,B0038M2S2A,"Series 4 is wonderful, but it is particularly enjoyable because the plots are sequential and interlaced.  They have always been sequential to some degree, of course, but by now we know all of the characters and can focus on their specific interactions.  In other words, the series has become a comic soap opera, not just an exploration of the quirky doc in a quirky locale.  The focus is now on the ongoing plot and we want to know what will happen next.  The pacing is excellent, the plot twists both interesting and fun and the scripts and acting remain at a very high level.  Give us more.",1282780800,,592,4.4953271028037385
4089305,5,B0038M2S2A,"The question to ponder after Season four (4) is will Doc. Martin stay in Portwenn or go back to London to resume his career as a surgeon.  Doc. Martin delightfully played by Martin Clumes in this fourth series tries all kinds of ""remedies"" (including some very bloody and gross ones) to cure his aversion to the sight of blood in order to be a surgeon in London again. In the meantime he is still the only doctor in the beautiful little seaside village of Portwenn solving all kinds of ""medical mysteries"" that are plaguing the hysterically eccentric inhabitants (I just adore Mrs. Tichell the pharmacist/chemist who although married to a nearly deaf man is completely besotted with Doc Martin and is very jealous of any woman that comes into his life) of Portwenn--Yes all of the weird folks are back including the hypochondriac plumber (now resturant owner),  the very inept police officer along with the highly inept receptionist of the Doc., etc.  NO Doc. Martin has NOT acquired any ""bedside manners"".  If anything, Doc. Martin is more surly, irritable and impatient then ever mainly due to his disastrous attempt to marry Louisa in season 3.  His gruff manner is not helped when Louisa returns very pregnant by him and filled with the determination to have the baby completely ""on her own"".  Also adding to his extreme frustration is the appearance of an ""old flame"".

Indeed this series continues to delight me bring to my life a lot of enjoyable entertainment--it is so well written and, most of all, it is so well acted.

Do buy season 4 for it truly is very entertaining.  As a previous reviewer, on this board suggested, you should get seasons 1-3 first because all of the episodes are ""interconnected"".

(I must add that at the end of series 4, we do kind of see Doc. Martin having some almost human emotions and I emphasize that he almost shows that he is really a real human--if the series continues will this ""side"" of him last? I doubt it and hope not.)",1282176000,2,1969,4.681159420289855

4089309,5,B0038M2S2A,"Having watched the previous series could not wait for this one. During the two years that intervened between Series 3 and this Series, Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) wrote a great book on dogs. If interested read about it in the book section of Amazon.com.  Ian McNeice, Mr. Large Sr. the Plumber, acted on the British stage taking the part of Churchill and Caroline Catz was in several other BBC dramas and plays. So this wonderful cast, alongside with Katherine Parkinson, the not so scatter brained secretary are back.  This is by far the best series , but if you haven't seen series one, two and three I highly recommend you start with them.  Is there going to be a series five? The various plots are imaginative, they stand alone but also can weave from one episode to the next. The climax in the end is a masterpiece of ingenuity and one of the best planned plots ever.  We can't wait for Series 5. C'mon BBC get your skates on!",1280707200,,930,4.485207100591716
4089310,3,B0038M2S2A,"After the first series of Doc Martin, I was a huge fan. The next series kept me hooked, and the third series was terrific, at least it was until the unexpected ending. It left me so disappointed, but surely the next series would set things right? Sadly, the fourth series makes matters even worse.

Martin seems to have undergone a personality shift in series 4. He's gone beyond anti-social, bellowing at everyone and deliberately undermining Louisa's and Pauline's efforts to get on with their careers. He had always been misanthropic, but now he takes on a particular disdain for women which is going to be difficult to explain away later.

A new character, his old colleague and girlfriend Edith, has been written as so one-dimensionally evil that we wouldn't be surprised to see her grow horns and rub her hands in evil glee. Pauline and Auntie Joan become uncharacteristically bubble-headed at times, quite at odds with their characters in the previous series.

For seven episodes, the old characters spin their wheels, and new characters who appear in single episodes act bizarre and eccentric. Martin appears to make progress in overcoming his aversion to blood and thinks about his own career. Rather than the bluster and embarrassment of the previous series, he engages in intimidation and rudeness which is remarkable even for him.

Predictably, the last (eighth) episode softens Martin's edges just enough so that we will come back for a fifth series to see if it's a temporary transformation or if he will become even nastier still. Scary thought, that.",1280620800,11,1566,5.0115384615384615
