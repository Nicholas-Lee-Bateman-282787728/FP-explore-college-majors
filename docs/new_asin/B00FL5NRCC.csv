8616629,4,B00FL5NRCC,"Tanta Agua is a delicate study of characters and human relationships. The slow pace and general boredom of the characters might be off-putting for some, but I loved that the directors chose a single setting and a situation where the characters are forced to stay together because it allowed for a deeper, richer investigation of the relationship between the children and the estranged father. Neither is immensely lovable, but they feel real, as does the whole film, and I liked it for that. Moreover, the acting is very good. Recommended!",1405296000,,539,5.0
8616630,1,B00FL5NRCC,Worse movie I've ever seen.  Wondering if the other reviewers actually sat through the entire 1 hour and 43 minutes...it was grueling!  I'd rather have watched paint dry then have wasted almost 2 hours on my life watching Tanta Aqua.,1402358400,,233,4.8
8616631,3,B00FL5NRCC,"We watched this film as part of the Film Movement series.  We see a lot of foreign releases, but I think this is the first one from Uruguay.  The entire film - save the brief opening scene - is set in Salto, the spring water capital of Uruguay.

Tanta Agua (""So Much Water"") is a small,slow-moving film which depicts all too well ""that vacation"" we all experienced at one time when we were kids: crappy weather, interminable days, tetchy parents fed-up with grumpy kids, well-meaning but irritating siblings.  Divorced Dad Alberto and kids Lucia and Federico (Nestor Guzzini, Mal Chouza and Joaqun Castiglioni respectively) suffer through a vacation week doused with rain.  Daughter 'Lu' is a 14-year-old hitting puberty, generally unhappy for most of the film, probably not able to explain why. Alberto, as her Dad, seems generally unlikeable at first but grows on you.  He grows on Lu, too.  At her most vulnerable, it's him that Lu turns to in her time of need.

There are lots of delightful, little surprises in the Film Movement offerings.  This one doesn't come close to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teddy-Bear/dp/B00BTUFP1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teddy Bear</a>&nbsp;(my all-time Film Movement find), but it's worth a look.",1400803200,,1280,5.489795918367347
8616632,4,B00FL5NRCC,"Tanta Agua is the first feature film of writing and directing duo Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge. It was a winner at the Miami and Guadalajara Film Festivals.

Divorced father Alberto Nestor Guzzini) takes his children Lucia (Mal Chouza) and Federico (Joaqun Castiglioni)to Salto, the spring water capital of Uruguay, for a vacation together. They leave in the pouring rain, arrive in the pouring rain and it continues for the first few days of their trip. (Tanta Agua translates as too much water)

Tanta Agua is in Spanish with English subtitles, but even without the subtitles, you would be able to read Lucia's unhappiness a mile away. She doesn't want to be there. Her father's attempts to engage, to have fun and to spend time together are either tolerated or rebuffed. She seems determined not to enjoy herself. Federico seems to go along with his sister's mood much of the time. The rain does eventually let up and every member of the family finds someone outside of their family to spend time with.

Guevara and Jorge give us a poignant look at father/child relationships that rings so true. The dedication of the film is to the director's fathers, leading me to wonder if Lucia's character had a bit of their own lives mixed in. It was interesting to watch this film as a parent. Alberto never stops trying to reach Lucia and the most moving moments of the film are when they finally share something. And Lucia laughs and smiles. It is a marked difference from the countenance she presents most of the film. Alberto's demeanor changes as well with that small offering.

The sound of the rain constantly falling was used effectively and underscored the damper the weather and the children's attitude has brought to this vacation. I though all three actors were wonderful, natural and realistic, Tanta Agua is a sweet little film about family and relationships. The pacing is slower and that may frustrate some viewers. I actually thought it mirrored real life very well.

The bonus film that is always included with Film Movement releases was a great tie in. Home Road Movie follows an English father's joy in taking his young family on road trip vacations. As one of his children remembers, the view changes as the child reaches adulthood and realizes what the car and trips meant to his father. Excellent short, very moving.",1400198400,,2334,4.825
8616633,4,B00FL5NRCC,"Writers/directors Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge have captured that sense of parent/child schism that comes form distance following separation. The film from Uruguay is aptly titled TANTA AGUA (`So Much Water') manages to provide that claustrophobic feeling (rain prevents excursions outside a living space in a little vacation that is supposed to allow a renewed coming together between a father and children): it is a cinematic trick that works.

Alberto (N&eacute;stor Guzzini) is divorced and arranges to pick up his tow children form their mother to take them on vacation to a thermal resort in Salto. His children are teenager Luc&iacute;a (Mal&uacute; Chouza) and 10-year old Federico (Joaqu&iacute;n Castiglioni) who are unsure they wish to spend the time with their estranged father. Constant rain compounds the problem of togetherness, as there is nowhere to go or nothing to do because of the confining rain. No swimming pool, no television - only Alberto who solos his attempt to entertain the two children unsuccessfully. But the proximity examines the schisms that have occurred and the boredom becomes ennui. Luc&iacute;a is entering adolescence and by nature doubts her father has any clue as to how she perceives the world, especially when Luc&iacute;a discovers a boy in the resort who stirs her nascent sexuality. The film is a coming of age story for both Luc&iacute;a and to some less defined extent for Frederico, but in the end the frustration Alberto feels as he attempts to reignite his fatherly role with his children he no longer understands is what make the film worthy.

This is a small film, rich in suggestion, perhaps a bit slow in execution, but well worth examining how South American families deal with dysfunction. Grady Harp May 14",1400025600,3,1767,5.153310104529616

I think because this film comes from Uruguay, a country not necessarily talked about in the U.S. media, is what kept my interest  The acting was engaging and it  increased my anticipation levels while watching the characters live through a boring vacation.  It was made by two female directors and its style of filming kept me guessing as to how it will end.  I did not know what to expect from the father and daughter's relationship.  Both characters were bored in each other's company leading  me think something bad was going to happen.  Teen-aged angst when a marriage breaks up is a great subject for movie making.  However, I found this young girl's demeanor annoying throughout the entire movie.  I also did not feel good about the divorce father as he came across as a bit shady.  He was trying to pick up women throughout the vacation with his kids.  In the absence of the mother's presence, the culture dictates the father ordering the young girl to household duties?  I found that aspect unsettling.  The film was okay but I don't understand why it got so much attention in the International films festivals?  Maybe the film industry is discovering Uruguay for creative talent?  It gave me the interest to find out more about this country.",1399507200,,1262,4.746543778801843
8616635,4,B00FL5NRCC,"This Spanish language film with English subtitles tells the story of Alberto, a divorced father who takes his two children, 14 year old Lucia and 10 year old Federico, on a family vacation in a South American country (probably Uruguay).  Apparently he doesn't get to spend much time with his children and he's determined not to let anything ruin the trip.

Unfortunately, the hot springs resort he's picked for their vacation spot is rained out, and neither Lu nor Fed are all that excited about the trip anyway.  There's no television and not much of anything to do.  Lu meets some people of her own age, including a couple of boys, and she stages an act of mild adolescent rebellion by joining them for a dance party.  At the party Lu realizes she's not quite as grown up as she thinks she is, and the result is some nice father/daughter time. In the end when the vacation's over father and children all realize they've had a nice time in spite of all the difficulties.

So this is a pleasant little film about growing up, or at least making an effort to grow up, and about changing family dynamics.  The pace tends to be slow and the background doesn't vary that much, but that puts more of the focus on the characters, especially Lu, who is excellently portrayed.",1398729600,,1267,4.5550660792951545
8616636,2,B00FL5NRCC,"The acting was very good and you really felt for the characters--the father trying to connect with his children and the kids trying to make the best of a perfectly awful vacation.  The problem was that the plot was glacially slow.  I normally like quiet, little films with lots of heart and this is an example but it really needed a bit more action than constant rain and bored faces.",1398211200,,384,4.4714285714285715
8616637,4,B00FL5NRCC,"As a fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, I subscribe to their DVD-of-the-Month Club, and this is the November '13 release (it will be available to the public at large in 2014).

""Tanta Agua"" (2013 release from Uruguay; English title ""So Much Water""; 102 min.) brings the story of Alberto, a divorced guy, who takes his 2 kids, 14 yr. old Lucia (""Lu"") and 10 yr. old Federico ""Fede"") on a week-long vacation near Salto, the ""spring water capital of Uruguay"", for what seems to be some much needed ""bonding"" and ""quality"" time with his kids (they live with their mom). Immediately from the start of the movie, it rains, actually it pours down relentlessly, making the long drive from Montevideo to Salto even more boring than it already is. They settle in their cabin, but the weather makes it impossible to go swimming and difficult to do much of anything outside. Eventually the kids get to know and befriend other vacationers, while Alberto has his eyes on a local receptionist for a possible fling. Will the three of them become closer as the weeks moves along? Or will the vacation simply confirm that the kids are emotionally miles apart from their dad, and unable to bridge the gap? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: while nominally the movie is about a divorced father and his 2 kids, the bulk of the movie focuses on the relationship between Alberto and Lu, a 14 yr. old who is at her most awkward puberty stage, and has trouble fitting in, be it in her relationship with her dad, or in her relationships with others boys and girls her age. The role of Lu is played by Malu Chouza, who pulls off a brilliant performance. She is at times sullen, deceitful, vulnerable, happy, and/or moody, sometimes all of that in the span of just minutes. Apart from the character studies, the movie also provides a fascinating glimpse of what life is like in Uruguay outside of its capital Montevideo. Makes me want to visit it. The movie is directed by 2 women, Ana Guevara and  Leticia Jorge, and as the movie opens we are informed that they dedicate this "" a nuestros padres"", and that about sums it up.

As always, there is a bonus shortie, and this month we get a UK shortie, the delightful 12 min. ""Home Road Movies"", about a father desperately trying to have the 'perfect' family vacation. Just watch!

Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign film that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Tanta Agua"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1385078400,4,2620,4.589743589743589
