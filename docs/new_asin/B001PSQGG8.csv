8334561,5,B001PSQGG8,"This is a complete bootleg that is completely unauthorized and features no Oasis music. It is sometimes packaged under different names like ""Brotherly Love"" and such. It's basically a cash-in that features a rag-tag collection of clowns from Manchester and other places who are interviewed on a used Panasonic handheld camera talking about all sorts of nonsense and trying to connect themselves to the Gallagher Bros.

I gave it 5 stars for the grift. Good hustle!",1392940800,,464,5.105263157894737
8334562,5,B001PSQGG8,Pretty decent telling of the Oasis story. Not much actual Oasis music and no band members are actually included ( apart from archive interviews) but a lot of decent stories from those who worked with the band and a couple of gems of info that go against the official line. Worth watching for sure.,1371945600,,297,4.518518518518518
8334563,5,B001PSQGG8,I have just finished watching this and found it to be a really good re-teling of the Oasis story. Plenty of Oasis footage and interviews with Liam and Noel and lots of others involved with the band. Absolutely worth the money.,1289433600,,226,4.536585365853658
8334564,1,B001PSQGG8,"That's right:  absolutely NO Oasis music is heard in this entire...well, you couldn't even really call it a documentary!  It's just a few guys (and by that, I mean no one of any consequence) sitting around talking about Oasis while some very generic instrumental NON-Oasis music plays in the background.  Save your money, and if you want a good doc., look elsewhere, perhaps maybe the film ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"".",1288483200,5,416,4.830985915492958
