7608365,1,B01ATCA3RS,"Oh my God, where to begin? This film started off with a genuine sense of foreboding and enough gothic atmosphere for ten films! But then, all too soon, you painfully start to realize that none of the filmmakers connected with ""The Boy"" have a clue about the importance of pacing and how to build and sustain suspense. While the story had potential, and considering how badly the film was written and directed, the able cast elevates it slightly above a ranking of celluloid-sludge. But if you're wanting something fresh and actually scary, just watch the trailer instead. I'm not sure I have ever seen a trailer promise so much and actually deliver so little in the end. Adding insult to injury, at some point you come to find out that nothing is as it seems, and the intended clever 'twist' has already been done more than once before, and you can't help but feel cheated. While there is at least one good 'jump' scare and the first twenty minutes is actually pretty creepy, the film falls apart quickly, becoming confusing, annoying and in no way shape or form, delivered what the trailer promised.",1459814400,10,1100,4.704663212435233
7608366,5,B01ATCA3RS,"Saw this in theaters and it was great! Not your typical horror movie although it does feel that way throughout the film. Sure there are many overly used jump scares and other horror clichs but that doesn't take away from the fun and enjoyment of the film. I don't understand all of the reviews bashing this movie without giving reason. Watch until the end and be prepared for your mind to be blown!

Bye, Lauren is a wonderful actress and does an awesome job portraying her character, Gretta. If you love her in the Walking Dead like I do, she will not disappoint in this.",1459555200,16,572,4.447619047619048
7608367,5,B01ATCA3RS,"The plot is fairly straight-forward: an American woman named Greta (Lauren Cohan) arrives in England to take a job as a nanny. She is perplexed when she discovers she is tasked with caring after a life-sized doll named Brahms, but the pay is generous so she plays along. As times goes on and she begins to ignore the strict set of rules for caring for Brahms, strange occurrences challenge Greta as she struggles to figure out if Brahms is alive or if she is losing her mind.

The film did well in it's advertising to be very vague in what kind of film this is. Indeed, even during the course of the film, you continue to wonder just what kind of film it is. Is it a demonic haunting, like Annabelle? Is it a killer doll like Child's Play? Is it merely a drama in which the protagonist slowly descends into madness?

Admittedly, I'm sure many people will grow weary of the film before the conceit is revealed. However I feel the twist truly makes the film in that it is so unexpected, yet does not come off as contrived. The pacing of the film is both its greatest strength and weakness, though if you are patient enough to make it to the end, I feel you will be pleasantly surprised.",1459123200,47,1184,4.352941176470588

7608370,4,B01ATCA3RS,"I saw the movie in the theater.  Others have described it so I won't.  I can honestly say that it held my attention all the way to the twist ending.  It is more eerie than scary, but I am going to buy the DVD when it comes out.  It is not a CHUCKY movie and though it could be considered to be  implausible upon close examination, I found it to be believable as it went along.  I would recommend it and am surprised at some of the low ratings.",1458691200,25,443,3.9213483146067416
7608371,1,B01ATCA3RS,I saw this movie a couple months back. I'm a big fan of horror movies and this movie to me was very predictable and very boring,1458691200,,127,3.923076923076923
7608372,3,B01ATCA3RS,"This was a pleasant surprise! When I saw the trailer a few months back, I figured it was going to be in the same vein as ""Chucky"" or ""Annabelle"". My preconceived notions couldn't have been more off the mark.

Greta (Lauren Cohan) takes a job as a nanny for an 8-year-old boy in a remote English village. To her surprise, she learns that the child of her new employers is a life-size doll they care for as if it was human. When Greta violates their list of strict rules, a series of disturbing and inexplicable events leads her to believe that the doll is alive.

The only nitpicks I have with this film are the obligatory ""cheap scares"" (of which there are very few, thankfully) and the fact that Cohen overacts a bit. Other than that, this was a solid thriller with an extremely crazy twist near the end. I wish I could discuss said twist because it's really all I want to talk about but I shall not spoil one thing. What I WILL say, however, is that it's originality, abnormality and utter perverseness will creep you out to no end and might even make someone (out here in the REAL world) reexamine babysitting or house sitting in the future",1457395200,6,1143,4.412322274881516

But I do occasionally enjoy an adult horror show, which I consider this to be. (I also liked ""The Babadook,"" ""Would You Rather,"" ""Shutter Island,"" and ""The Eye,"" for example.)

It's pretty to easy to figure out generally how Brahms is ""alive,"" but the movie does a good job of placing red herrings that will make you doubt yourself. I agree with other reviewers that the typical heavy-handed climax could've been handled more intelligently. And the very end might be called a twist but didn't have much point.

7608432,4,B01ATCA3RS,"Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) is hired to care for Brahms at the Heelshire estate. She is surprised to discover Brahams is a doll. The Heelshires go on a holiday and leave Great by herself to take of said doll with a strict set of rules. Greta violates the rules and to her surprise the doll rebels as things and the doll don't stay where they were placed. Being overpaid, Greta develops a relationship with the doll. Malcolm (Rupert Evans) stops by to deliver the groceries and we discover Greta is leaving a bad relationship.

The film had that same eerie factor of a doll moving that we, the audience has come to expect from Chucky to Robert to Puppetmaster to Annabelle. In that regard only Greta was surprised when the doll moved from one place to another. For much of the film, we were subjected to the been there, done that feeling. It wasn't until the last 10-12 minutes that the film grew and I started to love it.

Makes for a good rental.

7608454,5,B01ATCA3RS,"At a mansion and estate in the picturesque English countryside, a young American woman named Greta (Lauren Cohan) has been hired to come work there as a nanny, looking after the eight year-old son of an elderly couple who are leaving on a prolonged vacation.  Upon arriving there she's surprised (to say the least) to find that the young child she's supposed to be looking after is in fact a highly lifelike, life-sized porcelain doll.  And thus begins her unusual stay in England.  Through a local who Greta forms an attachment with, she learns of the past of the family she's working for, including the tragic death of their son Brahms (who the doll is named after) in a fire many years before.  We also learn that Greta has a hard backstory as well, having come to England as a way of putting distance between herself and her abusive ex-boyfriend.  And of course, strange things begin to happen around the mansion and with the doll.

There's not a lot I can say about what happens from there, because it would contain spoilers.  I'll just say that both the 'behavior' of the doll, and people's reactions to it, are rather different than what usually happens in a haunted doll movie.  Actually, some of the directions they take in The Boy are things I'd been wanting a doll movie to try for a long time.  The whole thing is very well done and has some wickedly memorable scenes.  This is a great horror movie with considerable crossover potential; highly recommended.",1508544000,,1469,4.658914728682171

7608456,1,B01ATCA3RS,"I'm moved to write this review, though it'll probably get lost in a sea
of others, because everyone's claim of a ""crazy twist"" is what drew me
to it. I love twists. Sadly, the twist here is that the ending was such
a deflated balloon of crap that I almost turned it off and I didn't.
The twist is that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and
didn't keep my eyes on the runtime. The twist is that I have more
patience than I thought I did. Surprise!

The only way other folks could possibly claim that this movie had a
twist at the end is if they were tripping on something strong at the
time AND thought they were either watching a drama or romantic comedy.
Then, maybe, the nonsense that transpires would be surprising. It is
not scary. It's not disturbing. It's not creepy. It doesn't build
tension over time.

Nobody's actions ever ultimately make sense unless you do a ton of digging through the review boards to try to find answers, and even then, it's admittedly full of holes. The really sad thing
is it has me longing for the stupid decisions people make in scary
movies that DO lead to some sort of fright, even if it's a cheap jump
scare. It's not even just that the ending disappoints, it's an entire
premise that sort of makes us feel like jerks for sticking around for
the whole thing.

What everyone has said about plot holes, both within the world of the
movie and the real world, is spot on. What they have said about missed
potential to portray this differently and under another genre is also a
good call. I watched one doll movie over the last few months that
really got me, and a couple that focused more on an entity around the
doll that were decent.

Guys, skip this one. Read the reviews with the spoilers and save
yourself an hour, then spend that hour doing something more exciting
than watching this film, like watering your freaking plants.",1507766400,,1881,4.3810888252149

7608458,4,B01ATCA3RS,"Great concept for a film that definitely delivers on the creep factor. There are a few solid scares throughout the movie, but it's the ""what is the obsession with the doll?"" curiosity factor that will make you stick with it. And for the record this is a totally different scary doll movie than say, Annabelle or Chucky. The filmmakers did a god job of creating a story that was very separate from what we've seen before. Setting the story in England was also a nice touch to provide something different. The performances are well done, and the premise definitely has an addictive quality to it. The ending was good, but I wish there had been more of a detailed explanation as to the ""why"" behind it all. The movie dropped the ball a little too hard in that area for my taste. I can't really go further than that without spoiling, but all in all I would say this is a good scary movie to watch.",1507075200,4,893,4.385542168674699
7608459,4,B01ATCA3RS,A good effective ghost like tale.  Shows you don't need buckets of blood to pull a good horror/thriller tale.  It does have some tense moments.

7608486,5,B01ATCA3RS,"OK, for the record, I do not believe this was produced by a British director or written by British screen play writers or anything like that.  I call this a British-style Classic because it is so similar is style, depiction, and general 'direction' as so many of the horror stories and ghost stories my British mother and British Grandmother used to tell me as a kid (which, by the way, I still love)!

Anyone who is a horror movie or creepy-movie fan and has seen their fair share will be able to see the plot twists coming a mile away, and if you're someone who needs story line twists and turns that you cannot see coming, this is not the movie for you.  But for people (like myself) who want to sit down with something familiar that still suspends, still makes your skin crawl, still makes you mentally play a little bit with the blurred line between reality and the preternatural (shout out to all ""The Haunting of Hill House"" fans out there), this is definitely worth watching.  And note it is not overly gruesome, though there are some scenes that will put you off your spaghetti and marinara.

To address one last point; why would I call this a classic British-style horror story when it doesn't appear (at a quick glance of IMB's website) to have been produced in any way by Brits?  I had mentioned above that my mother and grandmother, both British, had told many stories similar to this before.  What I mean is that the story really plays around with the line between what we know, what we think we know, what we sense, what we expect, what we experience, what we fear, and what we receive.  Every time you've convinced yourself this story will end with a supernatural element, it ends up being purely psychological.  When you think the story will reveal a mad-man, it reveals a ghost.  When you think the story is a ghost story, it turns out to be a miracle story, etc.  Also it has creepy children, and nothing is as quintessentially British as creepy children (having been one myself ;-D).

In short, if you're looking for a classic, well-acted and well-done horror story to curl to with popcorn, this is not a bad pick at all.",1501286400,,2141,4.518134715025907

When she arrives, she gets the shock of her life. But there is more here than meets the eye, which raises the creep aspect significantly, as the nanny is charged with carrying out a pre-determined routine. It stars Lauren Cohan of Walking Dead fame, who puts on a terrific performance and dominates the screen time. The storyline goes creepy, reaches a watershed, then layers on even more intensity, as revelations continue to come. It has a true jump out of your seat moment.

Review: If you enjoy suspenseful movies, this has a lot to offer you while twisting the paranormal genre into it. As a viewer, you're also invited to share in the emotional pain our leading lady exhibits as she flees from an abusive relationship and travels overseas for a break from her traditional life. It's when she encounters this unusual position to babysit a boy, a porcelain boy, that her world become a lot more traumatic. Sit back as she struggles with becoming consumed by this supernatural entity left in her care.

Spoilers! ------ ready?

Oooooookay, I'm going to tell you this movie isn't at all what you think it is and the twist ending makes it infinitesimally better. I went in expecting the typical spooky, paranormal scare and came out of it horribly shaken in a 'good, pleased to be so scared' way. Grab your popcorn, snuggle up on the couch however you want, this movie is going to pull one over on you in a way that'll make your flesh break out in goosebumps. It's SERIOUSLY good. Perhaps one of my favorite scary movies now because I didn't anticipate the twist ending! Usually I grow bored because by twenty to thirty minutes into a movie, I can guess the ending and only watch to confirm I was right. Well, I was wrong, so horribly wrong.

This movie demonstrates some of a woman's worst nightmares as the leading character flees from her abusive boyfriend. You find out in the course of the movie she was pregnant and he caused her to lose the baby from hurting her in his fit of anger. He's the classic abuser: overly controlling, frequent bursts of anger in a physical sense, used to intimidating others, and large enough to be scary. She goes overseas and becomes an au pair for a rich family's son. The twist being their son is a porcelain doll they use as a replacement for the boy they lost in a fire years ago while he was a child. They're very strict about the entire process of how to wake, groom, feed, and entertain him.

After a short interview, they agree she's the one and leave her to him while they go on ""vacation"". In actuality, they're so exhausted with the wild tantrums of their son that they're abandoning him to her. The parents commit suicide by walking into the water with stones in their pockets. We are graced with a very well hyped supernatural experience as she begins to believe the boy is haunting the doll in his attempt to cling to life and will protect her from her abusive ex-boyfriend, whom extorted the information from her friend and is on his way to make her return with him back to the States. In the last few climatic scenes, we're rewarded with a twist ending putting this movie not in the paranormal category, but in the thriller suspense genre. Watch to find out what happens and where 'The Boy' takes you, it's worth the time.",1494547200,4,2955,4.589015151515151

7608557,4,B01ATCA3RS,"I love Lauren Cohan & her performance in this one was superb. The reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 stars is because the ending was not what I was hoping for.

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie begins with a woman travelling in a taxi & the driver adjusts his mirror to check out her twins. They pull up to a huge fantasy like mansion & she is smitten. She sees the painting of a family - they look very happy & she assumes that she will be the nanny of the little boy.

We meet the grocer - Malcolm - he is a bit of a dark horse. He reads Greta's ""bubblegum"" & tells her that she has a dark past & is running away from someone. Little do we know at this point that he has hit the nail on the head.

Greta meets the mother of the child & then the father but when she is introduced to Bramm, she laughs. This annoys the parents. Bramm is not a real boy but a doll.

The parents treat Bramm as if he is a real child - Greta finds out that Bramm was killed in a fire 20 years ago & the doll suddenly appeared. The parents decide to go on holiday & gives Greta a list of instructions on how to care for Bramm. She thinks the doll is creepy & throws him aside.

Malcolm invites Greta out so she takes a shower to get ready but then her dress & necklace is taken from the bathroom. She goes up into the attic (in her towel) & ends up being locked there. She finds an album with the exact same picture as the portrait of the family but there is another picture - exact on where Bramm is not smiling.

Strange things start happening & she thinks that she is going insane. She proves to Malcolm that Bramm is real - possibly possessed by a spirit - so she starts caring for Bramm. The parents write  letter to Bramm & then they commit suicide by walking into a lake & drowning.

Her ex-boyfriend, Cole shows up - she was running away from him because she was pregnant & one night he beat her up & their baby died. He thinks the doll is creepy. He wants to take Greta back to America so she asks Bramm for help.

A sign, ""GET OUT"" is written with rat's blood & Cole gets violent & smashes Bramms head & it shatters to pieces.

I am not giving the ending away because you have to watch it for yourself.

Overall, the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat & I will certainly watch it again some time in the future.",1490486400,,2300,3.9545454545454546

7608645,4,B01ATCA3RS,"I saw the trailer for 'The Boy,' and the premise was so absurd I had to watch it.

With Lauren Cohan (of The Walking Dead) starring, it had to be a decent watch. From the trailer, you will see that Greta (Cohan) is hired to take care of an elderly couple's boy. When she finds out what the real situation is, she assumes it's a joke, but the couple is deadly serious.

In the first 2/3 of this movie, the atmosphere and goosebumps you will get are well-earned. Like most of the audience, you will wonder what's *really* going on. The movie plays it very straight and all the character reactions are very much how the audience would react. There are lots of variables thrown in to make you question what the twist, if any, really is. For this first 2/3, the movie earns an A+.

Very few movies can live up to a buildup such as the one you will find in The Boy. The last 1/3 of the movie will determine how you feel about it. For me, the first 2/3 were so good, I let the last 1/3 slide. Give it a watch if you want to be creeped out. Recommended.",1483056000,,1045,4.112745098039215

This is not a horror film. It's more like a psychological thriller, but a simple and fun psychological thriller, not a psychological thriller that has you funked up for days questioning your own existence.

7608703,1,B01ATCA3RS,"The movie focuses on a beautiful American woman named Greta Evans.  Greta comes to England to a country house out in the middle of nowhere to accept a job as a nanny for two eccentric, rich old people to take care of their 8 year old son Brahms.  The old couple are Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire.  The Heelshires give Greta and whole list of both house rules and rules for taking care of Bramns.  The kicker is that Brahms is a small doll that's a replica of their actual son who passed on long ago.  In a short time Greta meets the handsome food delivery guy Malcolm.  Well while Greta doesn't stay quite as focused on the strict rules she finds eerie and unexpected things going on in the other rooms.  Is it the doll or someone playing mean tricks on Greta?  That's the mystery that this movie leaves you with until the end.

The trouble with this movie is that not only is it slow, plodding, and painfully boring, but, it just throws together far too many horror cliche's at you to where it doesn't have anything resembling originality.  The main plot is stupid to begin with and to make matters worse this movie totally fails to be scary as it is cliche' laden and as a result is completely predictable from beginning to end.

To start with the location is terribly boring.  There's not much to look at and the cinematography is just plain tedious.  The dark scenes in the house are so dark that it's incredibly tough to see what the camera is trying to show more often than not.  The characters in this are only 2-dimensional and they are just plain dull.

This whole cliche' with the house starting out seemingly safe and sound but once weird things start to occur there are shots of the interior as we as the exterior of the house to make the house appear creepy and unsafe has been done to exhaustion.  The quick camera pans as well as the camera moving quickly forward as well as quickly backward is not only another tired cliche' but it's been done in so many much better  horror movies.  The creeping camera that makes it look like it's from the perspective of the killer or the monster or whatever is another horror cliche' that has also been done overtly as well.  Finally there's the cliche' featuring the camera focusing on a dark corner of the house where evil could be hiding as well as the shots from the banister to the stairs and the downstairs floor.

Another one is the noise coming from the other room cliche'.  In this case even you as the viewer don't get to see what occurs in the other room either.  It goes into the whole situation with the main character going into the room to see the doll in another position or some object being broken and so on.

There is a little bit of character development but unfortunately after you get a bit more info on the main character(Greta) the character development is soon thrown out and the movie goes back to being lame again.

This movie just plain takes itself far too seriously.  Some funny moment or some jokes or some campy filler moment might've helped this movie out so that not only could the edge be taken off but it might have made for a good opportunity to develop the characters better.

This movie has an almost sex scene and absolutely no nudity at all.

There's no gore or any tremendous special effects to enjoy either.  Just very ordinary make up effects, no computer effects and no notable practical effects.

As this movie appears to be building up to something major with it's slow pace and suspense, it just doesn't have a turn out that offers anything even slightly resembling any special pay off.  It's just slow and boring for no real reason.  Also the ending is just plain stupid and not worth bothering with this movie to know about.  It's also a very predictable ending as there are so few possible suspects.

Overall, unless you're someone who hasn't seen very many other suspense/horror/thriller movies like this one than chances are you haven't been heavily exposed to the cliche's and likely you would find this movie very frightening.  But this movie just doesn't offer anything new or all that special and unique for those of us that have seen so many of those similar movies featuring a haunted house due to ghosts or demons causing havoc and/or posessing someone who lives there.  The Amityville Horror series is one series that comes to mind when it comes to all of these sort of horror cliche's come to mind.  Even those movies did it better.  So if you're expecting this movie to have anything new, unique, or original to offer you as the viewer, if you're expecting any sex scenes and/or nudity, if you're expecting any humor, 3 dimensional characters, any excitement, a good ending, any cool gore effects or special effects in general, any classic moments, any good editing and pacing,  or anything in the way of any good scares then you are watching the wrong movie.  1 star out of 10!!",1479513600,,4888,4.530216647662486

7608715,5,B01ATCA3RS,"The Boy was quite an interesting movie, although I've seen too many recent horror movies end in the same way that drops this movie to four and half stars for me.  But other than that, it was a creepy sort of what would you if you were in the shoes of the main character (before those shoes disappeared that is).  If you travelled overseas for a break from the troubles of your life, were offered a job that pays way more than you could hope to make back home, but when you turned up to the isolated mansion for your first day as a nanny, the parents (or grandparents as you'd expect these two to be), introduced their eight year old to you and you're pretty certain, it's a doll.  Would you pretend you didn't notice and accept the job?  What it they went on a holiday and left you alone with it.  Would you keep up the charade?  That's pretty much the scenario of this movie, with Lauren Cohen (best known as Maggie from the Walking Dead) as the new Nanny.  Personally I would have kept up the charade as I'd be scared there was some sort of hidden cameras/nanny cam type thing the old people were watching me on, which would lose me the large wads of cash each week.  Since the tasks are pretty simple it wouldn't have bothered me.",1478736000,,1233,4.261802575107296

7608778,1,B01ATCA3RS,"In the beginning I found this movie somewhat intriguing and a tiny bit creepy and suspenseful .

However by the middle of the movie that all changed to being completely bored and rolling my eyes at how awful and absolutely nonsensical the film had turned into .

The doll was creepy looking no question and I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but this in my own opinion was an absolutely ghastly film.

The acting was so so the old couple were quite good ,the main character was alright yet her delivery was fairly dull and uninteresting and the gorgeous hunk was alright .

The twists in this film were unexpected ....in the worst way possible .

The ending of the movie ruined the first half of it that I didn't really mind and the rest of the film as a complete whole which is an embarrassing testament to this movie .

I could never recommend this film the suspense isn't much and what is there is immediately ruined by the TWISTS .

I've seen far better HORROR movies truly unsettling ones The Conjuring for example was absolutely terrifying .

These people need to realize that you can still make a PG-13 horror movie and still find a way to make it scary and intriguing.

Unfortunately the end result of watching this film was that this is NOT that movie.

Rent it if anything please do not pay actual money for this money unless you really want to see this film.

It is a good psychological thriller more then a paranormal one (as you find out later in the movie!)The ""vacation"" the older people had in mind near the middle of the movie kinda wrecks it for a little bit and it was unreal as to how the whole thing went down (it wouldn't have worked with just 1 small rock.... maybe 4 or 5 but not 1).

7608884,2,B01ATCA3RS,I had high expectations for this film and it let me down completely. The beginning of the film kept me positive that this was going to be a good one but after awhile it became pedantic and pedestrian at the same time. The ending was convoluted and lacked any real punch. Add the requisite horror movie ending these days to is which it did and you have a ridiculous concept. The surprise ending seemed all too familiar to me even though I cannot recall the film that it mimicked.,1472515200,,478,4.382022471910112

There weren't very many jump scares at all and the story was actually complex enough to keep me questioning what was going to happen next. There is a twist at the end that I wasn't expecting at all and it genuinely creeped me out.

7609002,3,B01ATCA3RS,"The Boy is not a bad PG-13 horror film but its not a really great one either. The beginning starts off slow & it takes awhile to pick up. The ending is where I feel the film is the best & is the tone I wish the whole film had been. Basic plot is an elderly couple hire a new nannie to look after their son. When she arrives the son happens to be a doll & things happen from there. The film stars Lauren Cohan (from The Walking Dead) & very few other cast members. All do ok in their roles, nothing to great. The film takes place entirely in a huge manor & its surrounding area. The manor itself has some really good atmosphere, just a really creepy & gothic feeling to it. My main problem with the film is that it is a bit slow at times. There are a few jump scares but not many. Now the ending is where I feel things really picked up but by then the film is almost over & for me it all came a bit too late. Had the entire film been like then ending it would've easily been a 4 star horror film to me. Give it at least a rent if you are curious, there are worst horror films to waste time on but there are also better ones. One last note, for those that care about extras there are none on the disc, not even a trailer.",1469145600,,1219,3.860557768924303

At the end you find its a person that puts the doll in random places of a fake looking old house to scare the woman. This Lauren Cohan is a horrendous actress. She over acts by far, a simple scare she makes like she just got zapped in the bum with a stun gun 5000 times. Her acting is way over the top and completely crappy.

At the beginning the movie held its creep factor but Greta the nanny was a tad bit too comfortable and didn't give the viewer the feeling of suspense/horror. I just kept saying to myself ""Why did she take the job? Babysitting a doll? Really? For some reason I kept thinking the delivery guy Malcolm (I think his name was) tied into the plot in a insidious way but he didn't. However, if the doll is moving around what is the most sane reason why/how this could happen and BANG! You have solved the riddle/twist to the movie plot.

I decided to rent it even though it seemed like a movie I could wait until it's available at no cost on Prime. Even though I hate to say this, it was actually a decent movie. It wasn't really believable, even though, the filmmakers tried hard to rationalize the different unbelievable events that happened throughout the movie.

Well-scripted and well-acted, its scary with more than a few jolts, but any veteran horror movie-viewer will guess the entire plot from the moment Greta is introduced to Brahms.  Nevertheless, the story is well-played out with a good build-up and some tense moments. The non-ending ruins the whole thing, however. With a satisfactory conclusion, this movie wouldve been a 5-star-plus.

Nevertheless, it's entertaining and horror movie lovers should enjoy it.

7609056,3,B01ATCA3RS,"I'm somewhat divided on how to review this film. I thought the first half was pretty cool. I liked the creepy doll, the creepy parents and the house in the middle of nowhere. It started out with a very Gothic feel and that excited me. I was waiting for all the unexplained creep out factor stuff to kick in. The actress was great and the supporting cast added a lot to the film. I enjoyed her struggle trying to figure out if there was something really going on or if it was all in her mind. That being said, as the movie progressed I got more and more excited, certain that I knew how it would end, but then it didn't.

Instead, another character showed up inexplicably near the end of the film, changing the entire point of the movie and acting like a bad imitation of a psychotic killer. The ending was left more or less hanging, and I am still struggling to understand the how and why of it all. Some movies that leave an ending open to interpretation work well, but for me, this was not one of those cases. It just irked me.",1468454400,,1029,4.223350253807107

Besides, the movie plays in a remote English countryside, in an old home inhabited by an old fashioned  couple,......... and their mischievous son/doll.  No wi-fi, no TV, no cell phones, no computers, and in my opinion, all this helps in creating a spooky  atmosphere. The victorian mansion is awesome, I would like to live in one of those wonderful homes myself. I loved all the  antique decorations and gothic surroundings, just this fact makes the movie well worth watching more than once. The acting and the plot is satisfying .  This is not a scary horror movie as other reviewers were apparently expecting. The movie is more about a psychological drama with a lot of  suspense.

This movie does a great job of creating tension and fear.  It even resolves itself very well so that you feel satisfied with the conclusion.  Give it a watch.

7609158,3,B01ATCA3RS,"This is an above average thriller because it strays from what we've become used to on the horror menu these days and takes a more old fashioned technique, and also refreshingly leaves the viewer guessing (as to what truly might be going on in this macabre mansion). Lately when I watch a new film I give it a certain amount of time before I bail ... but with ""The Boy"" that notion soon completely flitted away and I found myself just enjoying the ride. Plus, you won't find gallons of gore or a dozen cheesy jump-scares peppered throughout, I'm glad to report.

Now, this film isn't the most clever horror movie of recent times, but it was a pleasant evening's diversion. And as with most fright flicks, we must let the protagonist make questionable decisions, and just let things happen. This is a scary movie, a light diversion, not to be taken seriously or picked at. So you could do worse for movie night by giving this a whirl.",1466726400,2,932,4.514792899408284

And a big ol' spooky house??  Also love love love Lauren Cohan (Maggie from Walking Dead) as the lead.  Because seriously.  I could watch her in anything, which probably made the story pretty good for me.  The movie was very atmospheric.  All the acting was great.  I just feel like it wasn't very original.  Watch Housebound and see what I mean.  I didn't care for the ending either.  And the villain was so stereotypical.  Maybe I've just seen one too many creepo doll stories.

7609172,2,B01ATCA3RS,"Horror movies as of late all seem to be failing because of one major and unfortunate flaw: they begin filming without really knowing how they're going to end it. Well, that's what it feels like. Good characters, creepy setting, decent acting, really good build up to...TA DA....nothing. What writers don't seem to understand is that a good twist, one that comes out of left field and takes you completely by surprise does not work if there is no explanation for the plot turn. And there is absolutely no discernible explanation for the twist of this film. Even though its very reminiscent of movies like Friday the 13th and House of Wax, it still could have been pulled off successfully if all the ends were tied with a plausible explanation. Writers often seem to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together in the end and then simply present the missing pieces and expect the audience to  fit them together on their own. Sometimes that works but it just doesn't here. It's just a bunch of pieces that probably make sense somehow but with one or two of them still missing, it's wholly unsatisfying and thoroughly disappointing.",1466553600,,1129,4.730964467005077

7609181,5,B01ATCA3RS,"I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that The Boy is my favorite movie of the year so far, and is in fact the overall best movie Ive seen, period, in a good long while.

I won't rehash the entire plot as many other reviews here have done already, but as someone who can typically appreciate a good creepy doll movie to start with I needless to say found the idea of a young woman traveling abroad to take a job looking after a strange doll his upper crust parents treat as though it were a real boy to be very intriguing. Though I would not at all classify this as a horror film  you will definitely want to dispel any comparisons to Chucky or even Annabelle from your mind right now  the elaborate sets, soundtrack, and cinematography all come together to create a certain eerie and unsettling tone fans of the mystery genre should appreciate. (The story is probably a bit subdued to describe as a thriller, but at no point is it actually boring, in my opinion.) I found the main protagonists to be likable, and even though I can see why the revelation at the end has been a point of contention for some people I didn't at all find it predictable. A bit out of left field? Perhaps. But not enough to ruin everything that had come before it.

All in all The Boy is a movie I felt was somewhat mismarketed. I went into it expecting a potentially cheesy little romp with a possessed, serial murdering toy  which I can also appreciate, admittedly, lol  but was instead surprised by a movie that played it totally straight and offered something genuinely interesting to watch. Is it the best movie of all time? No, but still worthy of five stars for the kind of movie it is, and one I recommend seeking out if you get the chance.",1466467200,5,1738,4.348765432098766

If the deflation part was better introduced, taking the time to milk the revelation, and also giving the new threat time to manifest itself more creatively, I would have bought into it more.

While there a are a few little scares and some creepy camera work, the way the characters act in certain situations was completely unbelievable and stupid and yet it was a train wreck that I couldn't turn away from. I think one of the low points in the movie was when the main character reveals to her potential boyfriend that she lost a child. Apparently this news causes them make out on the spot.

Greta is to watch over Brahms while Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire are away. Greta is shocked when she learns that Brahms is nothing more than a porcelain doll. When they leave, she ignores the doll and doesn't follow the rules. That's when creepy things start happening. Someone is taking her shoes, and clothes. She hears movement when her door is closed and notices that the doll keeps moving. Is the doll really possessed by the spirit of Brahms, or is Greta just crazy?

Now you've seen the previews, clearly you see a movie along the lines of a little boy doll that may be either alive or some other supernatural event, maybe from the spirit world...that's what I got from the previews too, and I can tell you the movie does pan out in some fashion of that idea, which makes it good....(no its not cheesy like Chucky, much better, more serious, more eerie.....its the movie ending that changes the entire plot...in turn was disappointing.
You be your own judge, its worth a watch, but to me it could have been son much better but fell flat.

7609277,4,B01ATCA3RS,"Many writers have commented on the unsettling qualities of dolls. The poet Rilke wrote about their heartbreaking impassivity  how they just sit there and let you do all the work of dreaming them, of speaking for them and through them. He said the doll was silent because that was its constant mode of evasion. The doll inflicted its tremendous, unanswering silence. Yes, a dolls glassy-eyed lack of response can be disturbing.

But how much more disturbing it is when you begin to suspect the doll IS responding. Thats the chilling prospect faced by Greta when she is hired into the Heelshire manor house to be a nanny to their son.

Quite a few TV episodes and movies have dealt with this theme in one form or another. But this beautifully photographed film is freshly riveting - with the light shifting over its pearl gray interiors and the alabaster face of the doll. This movie was partially photographed in Craigdarroch Castle on Victoria Island in British Columbia. The house becomes a character in the movie. It immediately carries the viewer into a classic Gothic setting with all the burnished wood reflecting glints and intimations  and with all the many rooms and crannies available to conceal mysteries.

I found some flaws in this film. I had trouble, at least initially, feeling sympathetic to Greta. She seemed to be a jarringly modern American set down in this surviving enclave of a discrete Victorian world. While she does have the politeness to remove her shoes when she first enters the house, she then takes it upon herself to explore the upper reaches of the house, and even to go through drawers  when shes been told to wait downstairs in the parlor. She makes her intrusive exploration while gauchely chewing gum. Later on, I felt the appearance of her abusive ex-husband to be another anachronistic intrusion into the haunted atmosphere of the place  unless he was to turn out to be part of the explanation of the mystery.

Then the end of the film degenerates into a retread of almost every horror film franchise out there. In this case too, it seems as if the viewer is being set up for a sequel, a return of

But the premise of the film and its early development in the eerie seclusion of the manor house kept me on edge  afraid to turn away  afraid to keep watching.",1465516800,2,2295,4.698254364089776

7609308,3,B01ATCA3RS,"A quick, spoiler-free review of this film: The majority of this movie was creepy, well shot, and well paced. The titular character was, without needing to do anything, menacing and eerie. The two leads, Lauren Cohan, and Rupert Evans, had excellent chemistry together and made this seem more like a story that could happen to two normal people; however, the unfortunate trend these days is to have a plot twist two thirds of the way in to a movie to change things up. Sadly, The Boy went down this same path, and the direction they chose was disappointing and ultimately far less believable than what the rest of the film had presented. Add to that a completely disposable character,  and what could have been a much more enjoyable film is simply another in a line of those that I have seen, but will ultimately forget.",1465430400,,819,4.6482758620689655

7609310,1,B01ATCA3RS,"It had potential. But all of a sudden, you realize 3/4's of the way through the movie that all of the supernatural, creepy undertones are all brushed away and it's a lame twist which eliminates everything the plot has built up to. It made no sense after that. Don't bother with this one. Lauren Cohan is better than this.",1465344000,5,321,4.4576271186440675

Loved the ending so so much. Seriously, didn't see that coming. I watch a lot of *scary* ghost movies and this was much better than expected.

I love the mansion the movie was set in, the whole cinematography of the scenes were great. I would love to have that house... uh, minus the doll!!

The ending was pretty cool. I was thinking it could be that or something else. Can't give out spoilers.

That dude from Vikings that Lagertha was going to marry puts in an appearance too.

Highlights include: a decent borrowing of cult favorites (I.e. Crawlspace, Housebound) and a quenching of a thirst when you just need a mediocre horror film.

Young woman is hired to baby sit a child while the billionaire parents go on holiday.  She is introduced to their son, who happens to be a doll.  Yeah, it gets a bit odder as the film rolls on.  She swears the doll is alive and moving, as well as she learns the true back story behind the real life son after whom the doll is modeled.

This is not ""Chucky-like"" So don't expect this little bastard to be stabbing or chasing after you with his little legs.  He doesn't move.  ...or does he?  The trailer is purposefully misleading which Im glad as it lead to a nice surprise.

Ill leave it at that.  There is nothing new here, some have been done before, but it all adds up to a tightly wound story with most ends wrapped up.",1464480000,10,939,4.12707182320442

The idea of a creepy doll is certainly cliched, but I think this film executes it well. There are certainly inconsistencies in the plot, and the plot twist took a moment (or two) to fully register, but I think the earlier build up as well as the refreshing deviation away from a purely paranormal concept made the film stand out in the line of ""possessed dolls"" movies.

7609579,5,B01ATCA3RS,"Going into this film I wasn't sure what to expect since the advertising for it was vague. The movie does a great job keeping you guessing. Is the doll actually alive, or perhaps an evil spirit is possessing the doll, or my personal favorite, the main character is just going crazy.

The house itself plays a character in the film, besides the gorgeous architectural detail, its huge and creepy. It lends itself nicely to the question as to whats going on. Will Greta find details in the attic, or perhaps the burnt part of the house where the son died. Or did she get herself into a Scooby-Doo situation, and the house is filled with secret passages.

The parents of Brahms are great characters too, although we don't see much of them because they leave on vacation shortly after Greta gets there. The mom seems completely crazy, and the father just seems resigned that this is his life. Greta should have known something was up when a mom who is so dedicated to her son to just leave him with an almost stranger. But Greta has issues of her own, and is glad she can just hide out, without having to do much. Gretas issue comes into play later on, and only adds to the wonderful build-up of tension in this film.

At first I was going to give this film four stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I really did like it. There were jump scares that were done very well, the actors were very talented, the tension and music was used wonderfully, and the final reveal (while not shocking), was good.",1463788800,3,1516,4.426523297491039

and then a man (Malcolm the delivery guy),
to come to the conclusion that a doll is real - - a ghost or a demon or whatever?

It didn't take much for these two adults to believe that the doll is real.
Between the two of them, they didn't have enough of a brain to wonder what was really going on.

The Lowdown: Greta has just gotten out of an abusive relationship and has traveled from Montana to a rural mansion in England for a nanny job.

The Good: I really enjoyed seeing Lauren Cohan in a new production! I loved her on The Walking Dead (I stopped watching two seasons ago), and it was nice to see her in this role. Aside from the that, the creepiness of the doll (I really hate dolls) was well done and the general horror movie atmosphere was good as well.

The Bad: the ending. Oh, how I hated that ending. It really ruined the build-up that had been moving the plot along. So disappointed.

Overall: while this movie wasn't stellar and didn't stand out in the crowd, I did, for the most part, enjoy it. The ending will probably keep me from buying this on DVD but I don't feel my time was wasted. The movie wasn't boring, and it never really slowed down.

If you like these types of horror/suspense films, I'd say it was worth the time to sit and watch it. But be aware that the ending will probably make you want to throw something at the tv.",1463616000,2,1066,4.31

The acting is great, and the story is well written. I tend to see twists in movies coming a mile away, but somehow I didn't see the twist coming in The Boy. It was a shock, and a nice one. If you're looking for a story that will stick with you, creep you out, and make you really think about the human condition, check out this movie. You won't be disappointed.

There are a few scary moments that make you jump, but they're not overdone. I really like that about this movie. They have the really scary, jump moments in just enough to keep you on edge without overdoing it. I like the suspense of the movie - you never really know what is going on. It really makes you think, which I feel is important in a good horror movie.

Overall, this is a great movie, and I think it was really well made. You get a little bit of gore, without too much. You get the supernatural horror feel. You get the psychological intensity I've been craving with a good horror movie. If you're not into slasher films, but love a good horror, check it out.

This is the first time I seen her in a starring role and since its in my favorite genre Horror, I wanted to give this a chance. However after watching this I realize the plot is almost Identical to this British horror I watched on Netflix called Housebound which is in my opinion a far better film. They both have two female leads who end up in a house where strange things start to happen and is unexplained up until the end and you find out it was just some crazy person hiding in the wall the whole time. This has been done so many times no wonder I didn't see or hear that much about it in theaters. I like the acting from the cast members but the plot is where it falls flat especially in the third act of the film. Bottom line Had I not seen Housebound first I would have giving it a better rating.  I regret buying this on Blu-ray I should have just got it on DVD instead, to everybody else I would say wait until it's on Netflix.",1463443200,,1040,4.068292682926829
7609615,3,B01ATCA3RS,"Cinematography: Brilliant: The use of lighting and color really enhances the mood.
Sound Design: Good: Nothing wrong with it but nothing special.
Acting: acceptable: For the most part the only performance is the female lead. When She is being scarred or going crazy, its convincing. When she is doing anything else, especially talking about her character's past, it sounds phoned in.
Editing: Needs work: Until the third act the movie is all tension and no release. So this movie can be a very difficult sit because of poor pacing.
Story: Acceptable: The first act is a really powerful depiction of the psychological damage that the characters suffer. The second act is a pretty good haunted house romp. The third act is less emotionally draining than the first two. However, that is mostly because it seems like it was ripped straight from a mediocre slasher movie. The story has one major problem, it spends too much time building atmosphere and suspense and not enough time developing the characters. The only character who is at all interesting is the principle antagonist. His true identity and nature are not revealed until the climax. So we know next to nothing about him. We don't know if he doesn't understand that what he is doing is wrong or just doesn't care that what he is doing is wrong.
Final Analyses: I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't watch it again. Especially knowing the twist ending. Rent it. Don't buy it.",1463443200,,1423,4.836065573770492

Didn't care for Mrs. Heelshire (Brahms' mother)....she reminded me of your typical upper class, snooty rich woman (for lack of a better word....lol).  More of a psychological thriller rather than horror.  Added this to my collection and when my wife actually sat down and watched it, she loved it (she was shocked at the end).

7609621,5,B01ATCA3RS,"Great ghost story horror movie for entire family. My 10 year old son loved it and had not problems with the horror. He loved the jump scares!  Yes, despite the several down reviews stating there are no jump scares, I counted NINE major jump scares. A few others could have been, but for me they were anticipated and not jumpy. Some of them were anticipated, but were so dramatic as to make me jump anyway.

Aside from the thrill factor, this story was well-written, beautifully filmed, and features great performances by all. I'd give it ten stars if I could. It is not terribly bloody, and the violence is handled sensibly. (Thus the PG-13 rating). There are no F-bombs, but yes, a couple of S-bombs make their way into an otherwise family-friendly script.

You may think you know how this ends, but you won't guess it right. The signs and clues are all there, masterfully hidden in plain sight. But you will overlook them.  This was sooooooo much fun to watch with the while family.  If you family likes a good scare with popcorn, pizza, and ice cold beverages --this is the ONE you want to own this summer!

So that is what makes this movie that much creepier because it taps into that little creepy thought you had when you were 9!  LOL!  The ending was creepy also but mostly shocking!

Of course, there's the horror movie staple...the creepy mansion. They hire a nanny, then give her a list of instructions to follow to the letter, while they are away.

Creepy old house. Creepy doll. Spooky noises. Stuff moving when no one's looking. But then ...

... the twist ...

SPOILER ALERT

I get why the parents told everyone their son died, but WHY THE DOLL??? What purpose does it serve? I know the parents need a reason to bring in a new ""parent,"" but why not just hire a housesitter to be ""haunted"" by their sociopathic man-child, rather than hire a nanny, who thinks the old folks are a few crumpets short of a dozen? I was thinking maybe it would seem less weird (ha!) to give food to a doll rather than to put it out for no reason at all, but the son didn't even eat the food, right? It went in the freezer, and the grocery guy threw it out.

What did I miss?",1462924800,,964,4.1891891891891895
7609663,4,B01ATCA3RS,"Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) is hired to care for Brahms at the Heelshire estate. She is surprised to discover Brahams is a doll. The Heelshires go on a holiday and leave Great by herself to take of said doll with a strict set of rules. Greta violates the rules and to her surprise the doll rebels as things and the doll don't stay where they were placed. Being overpaid, Greta develops a relationship with the doll. Malcolm (Rupert Evans) stops by to deliver the groceries and we discover Greta is leaving a bad relationship.

The film had that same eerie factor of a doll moving that we, the audience has come to expect from Chucky to Robert to Puppetmaster to Annabelle. In that regard only Greta was surprised when the doll moved from one place to another. For much of the film, we were subjected to the been there, done that feeling. It wasn't until the last 10-12 minutes that the film grew and I started to love it.

Makes for a good rental.

7609680,4,B01ATCA3RS,"I quite liked this movie. It's kind of a mashup of the classic Gothic Romance and the creepy doll genre. In grand Gothic fashion, a young and attractive nanny (Lauren Cohan, doing an American accent for this film) arrives at a spooky old mansion to care for a young charge. I'm not spoiling anything by revealing that her charge turns out to be a child-sized doll that the elderly 'parents' call Brahms. Brahms comes with a list of rules that the nanny has to follow, as if Brahms were a particularly persnickety living child. Then the elderly couple leave the nanny alone in the house. Or so she thinks. There is a hot grocery deliveryman (Rupert Evans) who tries to date the nanny. And there is something else. I won't spoil the something else here. Suffice it to say, through the first two acts of the film you think you're dealing with one horror genre but in the last act it turns out you're dealing with another and it leads to a rollicking finale. I was pleasantly surprised.

There is an obvious parallel with another popular recent horror movie, but I think those two movies are very different in tone. I'm going to say instead that if you liked the 80's classic ""Hell Night,"" you'll probably like ""The Boy"" too.",1462838400,,1221,4.55

It's just a creepy movie.,1462838400,,327,4.559322033898305
7609682,4,B01ATCA3RS,"The Boy is inspired by possessed-doll movies, from Dead of Night through the Chucky franchise. The doll in this case is called Brahms. Hes the property of the Heelshires (Jim Norton, Diana Hardcastle), who live in a gothic house in rural England. American nanny Greta (Lauren Cohan, The Walking Dead) arrives to take care of their son, only to find Brahms instead. She learns that the Heelshires real son  also named Brahms  was killed in a mysterious house fire, and soon suspects the dead boys spirit lives on in the doll.

The doll here is approximately the size of a six-year-old, with a porcelain face, dark eyes, and an expression that can be read as threatening, sympathetic, or even frustrated. Director William Brent Bell creates a creepy atmosphere early on and incorporates a number of jump scares along the way, which do make us jump, but also undermine the carefully built suspense and mood.

As the Heelshires prepare to leave on a trip, they give specific instructions to Greta about the care of Brahms, referring to the inanimate object as if it were a living, breathing child. The remote location and inaccessibility of easy transportation explains why Greta doesnt run for the hills at this point.

The movie is pretty tame when it comes to violence, devoting most of its efforts to setting up and gradually unraveling the mystery of Brahms and why the doll is treated like a real child. Ultimately, the movie is about how tragedy can lead to a breakdown of family and insanity, and how the years turn an imagined reality into a genuine one.

The idea seemed intriguing enough and the more the movie went on the more I was enjoying it. I wouldn't call the movie scary but it did have some definite creepy moments. The thing that really ruined the movie for me though and took it from being really good to something I wouldn't watch again was the way it ended. Everything the movie was building toward was ruined and it really felt like watching a balloon filled with air being released. I know some people will enjoy the end but to me it was terrible and hurts the movie tremendously. Overall, a good movie with an ending that ruins everything it built up.

Stop laughing about Brahms rules and his perverted creepiness. The ending isn't what you'd expect but the movie
Has one of those 80  horror movie type of vibes.",1462492800,,271,4.530612244897959

7609699,5,B01ATCA3RS,"Definitely a good movie, but just an FYI - ""The Boy"" is actually a doll! He's not even a real human! I DID NOT see that coming. I liked how Lauren Cohan and Glenn were able to start a family, but then Lauren ended up getting really sick with some mystery pregnancy sickness and the end of the season totally left us unsure of what happened to her! Anyways, Lucille is the real antagonist in this movie and Jon Snow being resurrected by some ancient fire priestess was a real page turner.

5/5, would watch again.",1462233600,,512,4.333333333333333
7609700,4,B01ATCA3RS,"Most reviewers have written that ""the ending was unexpected"" or that they were deceived by the premise. We watched as a family and most of us liked the movie for it's creepy factors. Our middle son, who is a horror-fan, was also disappointed by the lack of scary moments. But even he admits that overall the movie is very creepy and tends to leave you thinking about it (which most good horror movies do).

The only advise I can give without giving the plot away is this; The story is about a girl who is hired to be a nanny to a disturbed couple's doll whom they consider to be their long lost son. From there, the story DOES unwind into an understandable and genuinely frightening tale... but don't go in expecting anything.",1462233600,22,726,4.458646616541353

7609702,1,B01ATCA3RS,"Ok, what could have been a great Horror On the veins of Annabelle turns out to be stupid as all hell.  Premise is old couple hire nanny to watch son, son is a doll. He is made to look like their dead son who died in a fire.  They treat the boy as real even has chores and a list nanny must follow.  Nanny meets boy, fall in love, boy helps find out about doll. Nannies ex catches up with her, abusive (of course) breaks doll.  Now this is where I thought yes, Ghost protect girl but goes after boyfriend too.  Nope, I'm not gonna say what happens but it sucked (oh, doesn't really make much sense either)",1462060800,,604,4.084745762711864
7609703,5,B01ATCA3RS,"I didn't expect much because of the bad reviews.
But wow, I was surprised. Loved the creepy house vibe once the lead character is ""alone"". It's a unique story too, not the same old haunted house/ doll that we see rehashed all the time.",1462060800,3,235,4.363636363636363
7609704,3,B01ATCA3RS,"This wasn't anything like I expected it to be. The previews looked awesome and drew my attention. I love creepy doll movies so I was really looking forward to watching this.

 The actors/actresses are great. They didn't make the movie a cheesy horror movie and their characters are likable (mostly). This film didn't have many characters at all and I like that because it focused on the story more.

 The ending disappointed me big time, it was not what I was expecting at all. The previews to this movie were a bit deceiving and had me thinking this movie would be scary, creepy, etc, but there wasn't a single moment that I jumped or wanted to see more.

 This is good to rent but I kind of hate that I bought it.",1461974400,6,715,4.378787878787879
7609705,4,B01ATCA3RS,"The movie starts with a lonely castle in the middle of nowhere. The tension starts building up right away. It is true that there are some other movies also with a similar plot but I enjoyed it from start to end thoroughly. The sound effects were awesome and will give chills at times. Though it will look similar to some other movies but at the end there is a twist which makes it stand out. I liked this movie a lot, although it may not be considered as super excellent it is not anything less than good.",1461974400,2,505,4.216494845360825
7609706,1,B01ATCA3RS,worst movie this year,1461974400,2,21,4.5
7609707,5,B01ATCA3RS,"I thought (The Boy) was a very engaging film. Even though it was rather slow moving,it still held my attention because of the creep factor and mystery of it all.. (Lauren Conrad) and (Rupert Evans) were great in there roles and carried the film beautifully and (Brahms) the doll was very effective as well.

This film makes you imagine so many different scenarios that could be playing out. Such as, is the Doll alive,Is there a supernatural force at work in the huge castle-esque home,Is someone trying to scare Greta (Conrad's character).

All I can say is when the twist was revealed I was genually frightened,shocked and delighted all at once! I've heard people write it's the same old doll movie,blah blah! So not true. While there is not any gore ,it compensates in other ways. It really creeped me out. I say it's a huge thumbs up.",1461888000,11,838,4.655405405405405
7609708,3,B01ATCA3RS,"For all its predictability, 'The Boy' still entertains on one of those late, restless nights when classic, gothic thriller production design is in order. Performances are more than capable, in spite of several illogical plot points. When viewing a film like 'The Boy,' it's not hard to imagine how much better it could be had it been written with greater depth and richness as regards character motivations. So much of today's thriller genre goes for the 'twist' ending, and frankly, audiences are now too hip to that sort of formulaic contrivance. Still, a creepy, porcelain doll, grand Gothic mansion within an isolated wood does provide a few jumps and leads to some moments, albeit limited, of intrigue.",1461888000,23,707,5.051282051282051
7609709,5,B01ATCA3RS,"Saw this movie in theaters and it was amazing!!! It's not a scary movie at all, but more psychological and it really was just well madr. Great movie. Can't wait for it to come out on dvd.",1461715200,3,187,4.081081081081081
7609710,3,B01ATCA3RS,"There's nothing really new than what we've seen done in other horror movies. Pretty much an horror movie that has a doll involved does the same thing. The jump scares aren't exactly scary, and the ending kind of had me questioning more than what it should.
There were plot holes that didn't get answered, the characters are so situational, and been done a thousand times over again.
Like her ex who was abusive, they gave him tight blue jeans, tucked in shirt, big belt buckle, and every scene with him was very poorly done. It just... Was very lazy.
It's rated PG-13 so it's not for adult audiences, but for teenagers that want to go see a scary movie. Which is why the writing isn't so complex, why the story is so poorly done, why the characters are so situational, and why the jump scares are so boring to me... Because they are aiming to scare those younger than me.
By the way, I'm 24 and I'm working on trying to become a film maker myself. So this movie based on the trailer alone I knew was meant for teens.
Pretty much any PG-13 horror movie is the same now.",1461715200,3,1068,4.345

7609712,2,B01ATCA3RS,"Now Where do I begin?  The first half of this Movie was Ok, Although the Pacing was too slow.  This film was Advertised as a Supernatural thriller, and it seemed so until the Big Reveal at the End which has been done Countless Times (doesn't anyone Remember ""Silent Scream"" or ""Black Christmas"")?  I liked the First Half of this Film but was Angry when I realized I had been had by the ""I've Seen This Before"" Ending.  Stick to the Insidious Movies, at least they Deliver True Supernatural Scares.  If you have Absolutely Nothing Else to watch and have seen it all then I would recommend this film, Otherwise skip it.",1461283200,,617,4.5225225225225225
7609713,4,B01ATCA3RS,"This movie is inline with the British thrillers made back in the 1960's. It's not a big blood and guts sick to your stomach flick. This is the kind of movie you should watch on a Saturday night alone with popcorn, Heath bars and a Coke. The film has intelligent characters, an attractive main resourceful heroine, and a left of center circumstance that keeps you watching to the end.",1461283200,18,383,4.565217391304348
7609714,2,B01ATCA3RS,"The Boy is a disappointing thriller that starts off with some promise before descending into a full hour of Maggie from the Walking Dead talking to a doll. Once the house owners finish the exposition and step out of the plot, there aren't enough characters to hold this idea together and it quickly collapses under its own weight. Our lead heroine really has no reason to hang around this clearly problematic house and the only time she calls her sister or talks to a local delivery man is yield yet more backstory that ultimately goes nowhere.

While dolls may well be creepy to many viewers, between Chucky and Saw, it seems that there's not much space left for scares. There are a couple of clever ideas bouncing around the set-up, especially in the earlier dream sequences, but the big reveal generates more questions than answers and doesn't stand up to any real thought. Although set in England to give it the ""aren't Brits strange"" vibe, it clearly wasn't shot there and doesn't really exploit the inherent unsettling awkwardness of a young woman living in a foreign land for long stretches of time.

Overall though, weak characterization and credibility aside, The Boy is ultimately dull. By the time it gets to the half-way mark without Maggie shanking anyone in the head, it sputters towards a limp and ludicrous finale. At a little over 90 minutes, it can barely sustain the audience's interest with so little meat on the bone. And to see an actress known for one strong character on TV being so passive and lame here is also hard to stomach.",1461024000,3,1553,4.726937269372693
7609715,5,B01ATCA3RS,I'm truly surprised a lot of people disliked this movie...mostly because of the plot twist at the end but that is what makes it so good.

There was zero chemistry between Greta and the grocery boy (can't recall his name), and the ex-boyfriend didn't seem like someone Greta would have dated.

However, being unable to act really didn't make much of a difference in this one because shes a prop in the movie to a doll. Its a very good mystery thriller with a very clever ending that was well worth watching. If you're expecting it to be a horror movie just because someone thinks the doll may be real Id say don't expect it to be Chucky.",1530403200,,504,4.260416666666667
