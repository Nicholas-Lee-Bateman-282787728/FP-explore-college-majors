6444834,2,B00KS6ER4Q,"so i'm noticing that most of the movies that have been rated 4-5 stars, usually stink!  I'm done counting on reviews.....clearly my taste is waaaaay different than everyone else on prime :)  i was bored by this film.....i found the little girls character annoying....the storyline was predictable. in closing i thought it sucked.",1419984000,2,329,5.188679245283019
6444835,4,B00KS6ER4Q,Looked like a good movie. Could not understand dialog. Closed caption was way off. Really spoiled an excellent film!,1419897600,,116,5.157894736842105
6444836,2,B00KS6ER4Q,"I think the storyline was good.  A little slow, but has a good ending.  My biggest problem with the movie is the main character.  She cries (poorly) thru more than 50% of the movie.  No tears, just grimaces and boo hoos.  Really became annoying.  Half the scenes didn't even need her to be crying.  Acting left a lot to be desired.  Just wanted the whole town to burn down with everyone in it before it finally ended.",1419724800,10,417,4.324675324675325
6444837,3,B00KS6ER4Q,"Very soapy melodramatic drama.  It would make a good lifetime movie. The acting was good, but basically the whole movie revolved around weak damaged women who couldn't see beyond their own problems to even help one another.  The ending was o.k., but seriously folks the main character could use about 20 years worth of visits to the neighborhood psychiatrist.  This movie just didn't appeal to me. There were too many ""secrets"" involving incest to keep up with and I also do not like the standard stereotyping  of the Southern a male as being a -0 on the evolutionary scale.  I try to stay away from movies that use stereotyping period.",1419552000,4,636,4.745454545454545
6444838,5,B00KS6ER4Q,I loved this movie but the closed caption was completely messed up. The movie was very emotional and had a good ending. I also was surprised in the ways the different characters had so many ties to each other.,1419206400,,209,4.384615384615385

The story is not very clear and the stupidity is overwhelming. In a nut shell. A woman that was molested goes home after several years. She's got her preteen daughter and is trying to run from the father for what reason I never figured out. The movie is foggy like that. She works, drinks, and leaves her daughter unsupervised around the same people that violated her when she was a kid. The end was a blessing because the trash movie was over.

6444867,1,B00KS6ER4Q,"The only thing that me made watch this movie was the cute blond guy they bring in within the first 30 minutes. One star.
The protagonist crying for 80% of the movie looks like that ugly Kim Kardashian crying face; I almost thought they super imposed Kim's face on her.  Minus one star.
Horrible screenplay.
Racism. (But it's the deep south of somewhere, I didn't pay attention.)
The N word said at least once so if you don't want to hear that...you've saved yourself.
The acting is sad, a high school drama club could do better.
It had potential but someone or a group of people wanted to appease the screenwriter/ director so they didn't tell her what a bad idea it would be.",1464912000,,676,4.451612903225806

However, could someone please write a plot summary if they can? I was left feeling frustrated and confused because I really couldn't totally get to grips with it. Who is whose father? Why is she on the run in the first place as the 'dad' of the wee girl seems totally reasonable? Why is the gran a mute that doesn't tell her about the creepy caravan guy? Why did someone try to kill her as a baby? Why did the sheriffs dad try kill that other baby? Any help here would be good.",1459728000,2,615,4.168067226890757

6444891,3,B00KS6ER4Q,"I gave 3 stars.  I agree with the reviewer that says the main character does annoy you immediately with the fake sobbing and the screaming, etc. Played every bit of the victim you would expect her to.  Then there's some reviewers that are complaining about stuff that isn't even important and stuff you should have gathered after watching the first 5 minutes but I digress.  Harper obviously works because she's hiding from bio dad and trying to do it all on her own.  If you pay attention during the movie, they do explain that the mom and Olivia lied to Harper and said old pedophile guy was dead.  The setting is in Texas people and if you know anything about Texas, theres a lot of country and berry picking, horseback riding, tractor riding and people don't give a second thought about letting their kids run around the farm all day.  The older men also sometimes call their partner ""woman"" ""old lady"" and the such.  Incest & rape, molestation & how slaves were treated back in those times, in small towns is an uncomfortable subject to watch, but its a real subject and real Texas towns like this exist.  I think they did a decent job working with uncomfortable subject matter and wrapping it all up with letting the past be the past, forgiveness and new love with a happy ending.",1457913600,2,1286,4.560869565217391
6444892,2,B00KS6ER4Q,Just not good!!,1457308800,,15,4.333333333333333
6444893,1,B00KS6ER4Q,"So, apparently, if I am understanding the conversation half-way through the film correctly, the grandmother (Joey Lauren Adams) of the little girl wanted her to get raped by the pedophile?  To make her stronger?  This seems to be the implication of not telling her daughter that the dirty old pedophile (that raped both of them as children!) was still alive and living on the great-grandmother's property(!).  Yet at the end she is forgiven?
  That's just one of the problems with this movie.  The first is that this movie is not really a movie, it is a series of overwrought vignettes in which people cry and shout flowery and cliched things to one another like ""you broke me open...""  It goes without saying, but there should be some scenes in which people don't scream or cry at each other that establish time passing and place and what people do with their time that are just not in this film.  Why is the daughter alone and outside all the time? Why is the mother working all the time? There is no sense of narrative structure and the editing is crappy.  This is particularly apparent near the beginning when the pedophile is trying to groom the little girl, the pedo grooms, mother is at work at night she hangs out with the hot guy, then its day again and the pedo is grooming-- it looks like the SAME day as before, same clothes, same location.  I started to wonder if the girl was a figment of her mother's imagination, like the film was trying to be symbolic or something.  Nope.
And the scenes with the pedo were so long and disgusting, they just dragged and dragged.  We get it-- isn't there more to the movie?  Then the scenes where the great-grandma and Chalky psychologically torture the pedo were too long and dragged out.  And not for one second did I believe that the people who harbored a child rapist for decades in silence would suddenly decide to up and torture him, that just wasn't psychologically realistic.  Oh, well.
So the movie moves on into some other issues.  Mostly blaming the main character for expecting her mother not to treat her like crap...  Everybody is related in ways they didn't expect (but that don't add up to incest that I could figure).  I really wanted to watch a good southern gothic and this has some incredible elements to it, the mulberrys, who's the daddy?, hot boyfriend who bolsters our heroine's spirits, a guy hanging himself after failing to bury alive the main character as an infant.  However due to lack of narrative structure, poor pacing, bad writing and inadequate editing this movie is nothing more than a parody of itself.  Which is a real shame because there are some good bones to the story (and it got funding and good actors).  What a shame.",1455753600,13,2711,4.60625

Should have ended 20 - 30 minutes earlier and felt MUCH longer than it claims to be. The acting was overdone by most of the cast, but fortunately not all of them. Scenery was nice. Music was tolerable.

6444900,5,B00KS6ER4Q,"I loved this movie.  It think Tricia Jo Hoffman should have had top billing though.  I thought it was very well-written, well-directed and very unique in it's storyline. Casting was excellent.  Being a small town in the south I can see why the men were depicted the way they were.

I wasn't able to figure out a few things though. Who was Harper's father?  At first I thought it was Percy, but because of the webbed feet, I wondered if Judge Mac's father was Harper's father.  I think I figured out that Judge Mac's father was Chalky's father (thus, the webbed feet and the belt engraved with ""MONROE"").  Or was Judge Mac's father Savannah's father who had had an affair with Olivia (Savannah's mother)? Webbed feet clue again.

I gathered that Percy had molested both Savannah and Harper, and had killed Savannah's father because he was going to kill Harper when she was very young.  I usually don't have trouble figuring out movies, but this one and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" stumped me.

Does anyone know the answer to these questions?",1444521600,,1045,4.6923076923076925

If it ended on a happier note, it wouldn't matter, it still was not a joyful movie. Two stars for the beginning.",1444521600,2,432,4.216867469879518

8661126,5,B00KS6ER4Q,"First off, I find some unexpected interesting movies on Amazon Prime that I wouldnt ordinarily pay to watch from Redbox. Some of them are deep, and have a plot line that is so uncomfortable that most folks boo and give it zero or a single star. But thats just it, the subject is uncomfortable and gritty. Not your everyday subject and certainly not the way things are handled today. That's just the way it was back then.

This was a fine movie about a sucky subject that nobody wants to think about. I was drawn in with a heaviness on my heart because of the way generational incest or the pedophile being protected from persecution at the cost of his victim(s) was just swept under the rug. Nobody wanted to be responsible for putting old Uncle Percy away for wanting to protect and take ""care"" of the little girls.

The Great Grandmere was an elective mute rather than speak of or be asked about the atrocities she knew had happened to her own daughter and grand-daughter. Yet she allowed the little girl to wander about until, of course, the little girl (her great grand-daughter) meets the pedophile Uncle that is allowed to live out back on her property. Does she think it won't happen again? Does she ignore it because it is so devastating and it brings back horrid memories of what a terrible mother she was, knowing that the man preyed on little girls in the family... but it's just way too difficult for her to deal with.
And nobody really cares that Uncle Percy was brainwashed to believe he was supposed stay with and take care of his mother forever (until she up and dies) leaving him all alone after she tells him he would never amount to anything and that he would never be loved by a normal woman. We see him talking to his deceased abusive mother in a mirror, repeating all of the terrible, negative things she instilled in him so he would be forever locked into staying with his mother and never having a normal life with a marriage and children. Very real and something that commonly takes place in abusive situations (a woman in an abusive marriage is either widowed or abandoned by her alcoholic, cheating husband) and in the mother's fear of being alone, she (the victim), abuses her son by shredding his self-esteem, cementing their relationship for life.

The movie ties it all together... the slave that bore the white master's babies, the master's wife faking pregnancies to raise her husband's illegitimate children, the Judge coming from that ""honorable"" family name where things were kept hidden so no shame was brought to his family.
The honorable Judge being blackmailed for sleeping with the poor white whore, whose father hung himself because his daughter was raped as a child by a relative and then later raped by a black boy, who turns out to be the Judge's half brother because his honorable father raped and had children with his slave.
Whew... what a mess. All are taboo subjects that were very real and commonplace in that era,  yet swept under the rug for generations while lives were ruined.
People complained about the main character crying and yelling throughout the movie but I imagine she had been depressed her whole life because of rape, incest and the whole sucky life she dreamt of escaping. And there was the main character's loveless mother, who admitted she was only obligated to raise her daughter to the legal age of 18. She intentionally never showed her daughter any love in order to toughen her up and certainly never  intended to allow that daughter (and grand-daughter) back into her life.

I think it was a darn good movie and as for the low ratings or negative reviews, those folks probably just never realized this was a very raw but real subject that happened more than anyone wants to think about.",1486080000,,3760,4.663650075414782

The movie focused way too much on the main female character and her depression while she neglects her daughter. Nothing made sense to me. The child-daughter acted too excited when reciting her lines, which made her acting looked fake.  When the father of the child, who had been chasing them to get his daughter back, finally found them, he did not even turn to his daughter to say hi during that scene which made no sense.",1484697600,,673,4.471544715447155
