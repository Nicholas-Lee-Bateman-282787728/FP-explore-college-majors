1622706,5,B00005LMB1,"To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure what episodes are featured on this dvd.  I'm assuming its 48-51.  Episode 48 is where Sanosuke fights the fallen monk Anji.  This is where Sanosuke's experience will be put to the test.  He is also the person who taught Sano the Futae no Kiwami.  I haven't seen episodes 49-51 so I cant tell you anything.  But from the cover I am assuming that Saito fights the blind man, Unuma Usui.
I would reccommend this DVD if you have money.  Why?  Because the next 2 Kenshin DVDs will have one of the best fight scenes.  Tenken no Soujirou.  The smiling psychopath will fight kenshin in episodes 54-56.  Episode 55 will explain Soujirou's mysterious past and in episode 56, prepare for a surprise.",996537600,6,730,4.538461538461538

7944018,5,B00005LMB1,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

This is an excellent volume. The fight between Sano and Anji is finished. Seito fights the blind swordsman, and Kenshin's rematch with Aoshi begins.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353110400,2,1292,4.841628959276018

The Only ones that I Could say by any chance that is better would probadly be ""Innoncence And Experince"" and ""Fire Relclium"" and posibly ""Heart of the Sword"". sorry if I mispelled anything (LOL)!!",1076803200,,278,4.346153846153846
7944021,5,B00005LMB1,"the first episode on this disc is the ending of Anji and Sanosuke's battle, Sanosuke shows that he has learned something from hanging around with Kenshin for so long
the second is Saito vs Usui, we get to see Saito's newest and most lethal variation of Gatotsu, the Zero shiki Gatotsu
the next two are Aoshi vs Kenshin, this is probubly the third best fight, though its mainly alot of talking, its got its good points
the last one is good, even though it was edited(do NOT watch it dubbed in english) and its more humorous than a serious fight....untill a guy named Fuji shows up....
all in all its good, and is necessary to know whats gonig on next...get the next two dvds (innocence and experience, and fire requium) so you don't miss anything for a second...",1059955200,4,761,4.521739130434782
7944022,5,B00005LMB1,"Ever since I first saw Rurouni Kenshin in fansubs 3-4 years ago, it has been my favorite anime series of all time, and to me, the Kyoto Arc is surely its pinnacle.  I'm more interested in characterization than action, so I tend to dislike very combat-oriented animes, but the series of battles that resolves the Kyoto Arc is not only excellent action, but has such human interest behind it that it never fails to satisfy, even for a ""chick flick"" lover like me.
And that's what fills this tape, with episodes 48-52.
48 finishes Sanosuke's battle with Anji (begun in 47 on the previous tape).  We learn of the tragic past that turned Anji into the vengeful ""Myouou,"" and those memories are what brings the fight to resolution.
49 is Saitou vs. Usui (""Battle of the Creepy Guys"" as I like to say ^_~;) and does a great job of showcasing both of them.
50 and 51 are Kenshin's promised rematch with Shinomori Aoshi.  Another reviewer complained of this fight being talky, and they have a point, but I actually like that about it; this fight with all that talk effectively brings Aoshi's character the resolution that's been pending since episode 11, and pushes Kenshin to his limits as well.
The end of 51 and all of 52 are devoted to the battle at Aoiya: Yahiko vs. Henya, Kaoru and Misao vs. Kamatari, and the Aoiya Oniwabanshu vs. Iwanbou.  Yahiko, Misao, and Kamatari especially have wonderful moments in here.  (I do want to point out a pun in the original Japanese; two words for ""scythe"" and ""gay"" are both pronounced ""kama"", so the realization about Kamatari was ""So it's not a kama-onna (scythe girl), it's a kama-otoko (gay man).""  I've seen fansubbers try to keep the pun with horrid results, so I respect Anime Works just bowing out of it.)
The tape ends with Kenshin headed toward his battle with Soujiro, and with the appearance at Aoiya of the Juppon Gatana's ""secret weapon""---quite a cliffhanger!
This tape also begins the ""It's Gonna Rain!"" end theme, which I think is RK's best.
Being used to some pretty lackluster fansubs, the picture quality of Anime Works' version, to me, was beautiful and refreshing, and despite some conspicuous ""guest artist"" episodes (notably 50), RK's art is always strong---notice especially the wonderfully varied lighting effects.  The subtitling was good overall; the timing was perfect, but being an obsessed fan who knows a tiny smattering of Japanese, I did catch a few translation nits.  For example, at the start of this tape (reiterating the end of ep 47), Sano tells Anji ""It's too late to pray for me,"" when he actually said ""it's still early"", and the credits give Anji's surname as ""Yukuyama"" when it's actually ""Yuukyuuzan"", but after the first episode, I relaxed into it, and I don't think there are any translation problems to get worked up about.
All in all, I think Anime Works did a good job, and although I wouldn't suggest this tape as someone's first taste of RK, being that it's right in the middle of the show's largest, most complex story, this one has my hearty recommendation!",1052870400,21,3046,4.744801512287334
7944023,5,B00005LMB1,"This DVD has five episodes.  Sanosuke finishes his fight with Anji, Saito challenges Usui, and Kenshin fights Aoshi.  Oh yeah, Kaoru, Yahiko, and the Oniwabanshu fight three other villians. Well, I have to say that Anji and Sanosuke's fight was poignant.  Saito vs. Usui fight is pretty cool.  At first, I though it was a boring fight, but it grew on me over time.  Aoshi vs. Kenshin fight was ok, but Kenshin was talking too much.  They both said ""Shikijou, Hyotogo, Beshimi, and Hannya"" so many times it gets really irritating. And last but not least the fight with oniwabashu and three juppongatana.  That fight was good too.  If you didn't buy faces of evil, than don't get this one.  You have to see the whole Kyoto Arc, not just parts of it!  If you can't afford the DVD, than buy the VHS subtitled in english verson.  OK, BYE",1045353600,,832,4.516778523489933
7944024,5,B00005LMB1,"In this long awaited set of episodes, Sano completes his fight with Anji, and Saito fights Usui, but the real drama comes from a suprise ""vengence"" fight between Kenshin and Aoshi. Aoshi swore to kill Kenshin (or be killed) way back in episode fifteen, and finally gets his chance to avenge the slaughtered members of his group. Kenshin, however, is restrained by a promise to bring Aoshi back to Misau. When Aoshi launches a ""no holds barred"" attack--can Kenshin defeat him without reverting back to Battousi the Man Slayer? Meanwhile, just to keep you on your toes, three members of the Juppengata turn up with 150 armed soldiers to take out Kauro, Yahito, and Misau... and grandpa cannot help them because of his previous fight with Aoshi! Will Kenshin's master arrive to save the day... or is all lost? This series of episodes is packed with suprises! It's a must!!!! (...)",1005264000,13,877,4.814569536423841

However, this isn't the only fight in this DVD. We get to see Kaoru and Yahiko fight against the rest of Shishio's group. Kenshin fights against Aoshi in a bookroom and Saito fights against Usui, the blind guy. This DVD contains 5 episodes filled with great fights.

7944026,5,B00005LMB1,"I've already seen 2 of the recent DVDs. Rurouni Kenshin: Shadow of the Wolf and Rurouni Kenshin: Ice Blue Eyes. Both are wickedly cool. Definitely action-packed, so much drama and seriousness, and a bit of humor too. I just can't wait to see the next episodes. I love Kenshin very much. In fact, I even made a sketch of him, just out of inspiration. It's the truth if you don't believe me. I'll be posting it someday in my webpage. Wait and see! Anyway, Kenshin's the man!",1002153600,,472,4.436781609195402
