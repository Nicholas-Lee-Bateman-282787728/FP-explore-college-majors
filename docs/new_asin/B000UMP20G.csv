8213824,3,B000UMP20G,I would have enjoyed and kept these DVDs if the program was made with just Alton. He has his sister on the shows and her voice is like nails on a chalkboard. I quickly passed them along. One star in the family is OK.,1231459200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8213825,5,B000UMP20G,"This was a good DVD to get started with; my wife and I both love it.  Alton Brown is one of the best cooks on showing you how to cook, and why you have to do it the way that he shows you. I don't think you can go wrong with this DVD.
In joy",1203465600,4,240,3.3636363636363638
8213826,5,B000UMP20G,"I have yet to see Alton Brown do anything I haven't liked.  His shows are a joy and the only thing on the food network that i can get my boyfriend to watch.  His recipes are superb though challenging now and then but that is not what I watch the shows for. In his funny, oddball way Alton teaches you about everything from the origin of words, the history of food to the scientific basis of cooking.  You absolutely can never take Alton seriously,  but you will learn a ton watching his shows.  I've shared his show with my friends and he now has a herd of 20 something girls in love with him and boys who watch intently trying to figure out just how to rig the power tools he occasionally uses to cook with.  Do you know where vanilla comes from? What makes things thicken or thin in a recipe? You pick up fun trivia along with useful cooking tips without even noticing it when watching his show.  Hes goofy as heck but knows his stuff.",1199577600,7,937,4.230337078651686
