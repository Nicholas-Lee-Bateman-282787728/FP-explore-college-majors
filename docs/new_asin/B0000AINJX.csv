7997308,5,B0000AINJX,"Amazing how different cultures see evil, is it not? Take demons or as the Japanese call them Youkai. Half demons are Hanyou like InuYasha or Naraku. However, in Europe, demons are depicted more like imps or devils. The Japanese believe they can take on any forms they wish and usually appear as animals, birds, fish or even humans. This funny looking film, however, is terrifying to the extremes! The characters are diverse and cute at first, but as this poor girl learns too late, they ain't what they seem to be at all!",1494028800,,521,4.612903225806452
7997309,5,B0000AINJX,One of the best of the Yokai movies of that time. Compared to the other two of the Yokai movie series.,1484179200,,102,3.9047619047619047

7997311,4,B0000AINJX,"Classic 1960's Japanese fantasy meets samurai saga.  This is the last of the Yokai trilogy and is, in my opinion, the best one.  Full of great scenes and appropriate for all ages ! Definitely recommend!!!!",1416096000,,205,4.828571428571428
7997312,5,B0000AINJX,"This movie is more like a samurai movie than the other two Yokai Monsters movies. That being said, it's a fairly good one. The story focuses on a cute little girl whose grandfather is murdered. She is forced to flee the assassins and search for her father. Along the way she meets a wandering samurai who takes her into his protection and helps her in her search. It's a heartwarming tale, but it also has some action and elements of the supernatural--it's called 'along with ghosts' after all.

I'd say it's probably the best out of the three Yokai Monsters movies. Definitely better than 100 monsters, but more mature than Spirit Warfare.",1384128000,2,640,4.714285714285714
7997313,4,B0000AINJX,"""Along With Ghosts"" is the third of the Yokai Monsters series and is an interesting installment, though still the least satisfying of the bunch, ""Spook Warfare"" being hard to beat. Made in 1969, this story of rival feudal Japanese warlords dominates the film, while the spirit creatures play an extremely small part, which is unfortunate. At the outset an old man, Jinbei (Bokuzen Hidari) is caught in the woods at night and interrupts an ambush. Though mortally wounded, he manages to get back to his house and set his seven year old granddaughter Miyo (Masami Furukido) on a journey to Yui to find her father, providing her with a pair of mysterious dice that protect her.

Much of the film is wandering around in the woods and rural Japan, but the acting is generally good, and Furukido does especially well for such a young age. The plot revolves around a battle for good and evil, and the Onizuka spirits are definitely on the side of good though they are rarely seen (first at about 31 minutes into the film, and very intermittently thereafter.) Familiar Japanese star Kjir Hong is the hero, and his hair looks quite mod for a feudal warrior: he is uniformly excellent in his role; in fact his presence alone is the single biggest feature of the movie. The film features generally good English subtitles, though a few colloquialisms seem off. The plot is very straightforward through the kidnapping, good versus evil, penance, repentance, and resolution phases. The biggest negative is that people watching the film expect a lot of the spirit monsters from the first installments, and they are scant. I did like the ""dice of death"" scene, and thought that Furukido did especially well with it, though the ending is particularly abrupt and unsatisfying. Of course the effects are not scary or realistic (there is a reason these films sometimes are compared to the works of Sid and Marty Krofft,) but here the mood achieved by directors Yoshiyuki Kuroda and Kimiyoshi Yasuda is genuinely eerie and showcases an admirable grasp of lighting and perspective.

While this is not my favorite of the Yokai Monsters series, fans will still enjoy it, and it serves as an interesting example of postwar Japanese filmmaking.",1340755200,2,2218,4.8962765957446805
7997314,5,B0000AINJX,"I am in to cheesy B-Movies so I ordered this.  However, it was not the usual ""guy in a rubber suit"" movie.  Unlike the Godzilla types, this one was a more traditional fare.  I liked that it was more representative of a Japanese movie, made and shown to a Japanese audience.",1274140800,,273,4.313725490196078
7997315,5,B0000AINJX,"If you like samurai movies, ghost stories, and Sid and Marty Krofft, this is the movie for you.  Third in the 'Yokai Monsters' series, this is a Meiji period piece with an edge.  Surprisingly excellent plot, and a very cool performance by Kojiro Hongo (the guy from all the Gamera movies) in his Late Elvis phase.  Add a cute kid looking for her dad, and you are in for 80+ minutes of strange cinema -- think Stephen King re-writing Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'.
Odd!  Even!!",1080086400,8,473,4.595238095238095
