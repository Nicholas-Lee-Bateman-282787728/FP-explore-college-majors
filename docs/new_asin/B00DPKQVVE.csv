5842233,5,B00DPKQVVE,Great documentary if you are way into music and/or this band.  I would have loved if they showed more of the band's music - but still great.,1386288000,,140,4.185185185185185
5842234,5,B00DPKQVVE,"It's amazing to realize I had absolutely no idea of how the music industry works. This opened our eyes also to the reality the people think it's ok to steal music and movies from the internet. The ones that get hurt the most, are the artists that created something so precious and capable of touching our souls in a way material things would never be able to accomplish.

Jared Leto, Shannon Leto and Tomo are incredibly talented musicians. I'm personally a big fan from Jared Leto since his day of My so called life. And to see how much he has grown as artist and to see all of the shapes, forms and sounds of his talents throughout such a short period of time.

This documentary shows how the band had to fight against an absurd law suit and how the that struggle made 30 seconds to mars become more united. Throughout the litigations, Jared as the mastermind and the band created an album, This is War, filled with powerful lyrics, sounds and ideas that turned into songs, making them greater and stronger than ever.

Once again, Jared proves to have an array of talents by directing this film in such a wonderful way.",1386115200,10,1121,4.485294117647059
5842235,5,B00DPKQVVE,"I found out about this after watching Jared Leto on Jon Stewart tonight.  So, since I love documentaries, I figured ""why not"".

I thought that this was very informative.  I got a real inside view of both the creative process of making an album, and the dirt and grime of the music business.  The juxtaposition presented in the movie was fascinating.  Just by watching what 30 Seconds to Mars went through made me understand why Mackelmore chose to remain an independent artist.  I mean imagine selling millions of albums and not get paid for it?  This is the situation presented in the film: the only one not making money from the music is the artist who creates it.

I highly recommend this movie.

As for the music.  I think that I'm gonna go to get  ""This Is War"" on itunes. I heard the pieces of the album as it came together.  Now I want hear the whole thing.  Kudos.",1386115200,28,872,4.408805031446541
5842236,4,B00DPKQVVE,"This group can preform just as good live as on their cd. They can remind you of Yes. The vocal delivery reminds one of Jon Anderson however it is not puffy and airy like  ( some of the ) current Yes clone Anderson wannabes. Anderson could deliver raw and aggressively and he happened to have a high voice.  The music arrangements flow nicely are complex at times and COOK. A touch of Gentle Giant here a dash of Holdsworth there all rooted in a  Brufordian feel .There is an overall upbeat sunny aura , not dreary like some of these other prog wannabes that have crawled out of the woodwork. haha",1385337600,,596,4.351351351351352

5842271,3,B00DPKQVVE,"The documentary is put together well and it's entertaining to watch. At the core is the same age old debate; should the record companies that put up all the upfront capital, pay all the expenses, and make the artist known get rich, or should the artist who probably wouldn't be generating that kind of revenue without the record label get rich. Artists like to try and frame the debate as ""Art vs Greed."" Technically it's ""Greed vs Greed"" as this documentary skillfully documents",1481068800,,479,4.783132530120482

Unfortunately there was just too much of their music in it for me to even be able to watch for the interesting bits. I had to turn it off at the point where Leto and the guitarist were philosophizing about art and music and how they really hoped their new album would be timeless and make some kind of a huge and lasting impact on the world.

Not only is this educational in the field of the music business but it also shows what goes on behind the scenes to create the wonderful music that 30 Seconds to Mars does.

In the end, the band re-signs with the record label anyway, and at live shows, they seem to encourage fans to illegally download their albums which is brilliant.",1451347200,,496,4.916666666666667

5842361,3,B00DPKQVVE,"Ill admit it- I live under a rock and didn't really know who Jared Leto was. It wasn't until I saw Requiem For a Dream listed as one of his credits that I realized I -had- seen him in something before, but aside from that, I had no knowledge of the guy. 30 Seconds to Mars is a band I hadnt heard any songs from either! But not too long ago, someone mentioned Artifact being an amazing documentary about the band and their struggles with getting out of their contract with EMI. I knew the music business was a shady one, especially when I saw Behind the Music: TLC, where Left Eye went over how record sales work, and just how little the artists get paid when alls said and done. While we live in a different age of music now, where anyone can put out anything, those who still want to make it big should really watch Artifact before they go signing any deals.

Artifact covers 30 Seconds to Mars attempt to get out of their contract with EMI, one of the biggest labels there is. EMI claimed that the band owed them a lot of money, and when they tried to back out of the deal, they were hit with a (wait for it) 30 million dollar lawsuit. This documentary covers everything from beginning to end of that lawsuit, as well as the bands journey into trying to make a new album while all these issues are going on. You get a good breakdown of how the industry works, what exactly all gets taken out of the money musicians make, how they can end up owing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars without making a dime from the album, and how stupid the whole thing is. If you needed proof that there are still outdated models of things out there that people still go by and refuse to change, this is all you need to see.

I won't go so far as to say that this documentary is amazing like so many others claim. A lot of whats here has been out in the open for a long time, and with how its filmed, you're mostly getting half-making of the album, half-lawsuit problems. Like I said earlier, I hadnt heard any of the bands music until I watched this, and if I were a fan, Id probably like the documentary more. As it is, I thought they could have covered the lawsuit more than they did. Its clear that the stress of everything was preventing them from having as much creativity as they normally would, and Jared Leto seems oblivious to everything that pops up. I don't have anything against the guy, but he sure didn't come off as very likable here, even when meeting fans. Im sure they kept that footage in for fun, but it didn't look like Jared wanted to be there most of the time. I also wasn't a fan of the scarf that seemed like he was forced to wear 90% of the time, even indoors, but hey, thats just me.

The documentary is well-done though, with 30 Seconds to Mars legal friends stepping in and really taking it to EMIs representatives. While the band signed a deal stating that they would put out x albums and do x shows or whatever, theres a law stating that no one can be under contract for over 7 years. I didn't know about that law, and seeing EMI try to bully the band into staying with them was really something. There even comes a point where they tell Leto that theyll contact him tomorrow about a resolution, but weeks go by before he hears anything more from them. This documentary isn't one-sided for the band, rather, EMI makes themselves look bad consistently.

Artifact isn't bad. I wouldve liked more interaction with the other band members to get a better look at how everyone was feeling about the lawsuit, rather than just Jared. It was nice that they included brief interviews from other artists and people in the industry to talk about how messed up everything is, from Serj Tankian from System of a Down, and Chester Bennington from Linkin Park. 30 Seconds to Mars fans will love this no matter what, and non-fans can still learn some interesting things.",1439164800,4,3885,4.347107438016529

5842364,5,B00DPKQVVE,"An absolutely fantastic movie and an even better depiction of an ever-evolving industry. I first watched this film simply because I was a fan of Thirty Seconds to Mars and enjoyed simlar films about bands (Start the Machine - Angels and Airwaves), but the combination of his directing ability and the story itself make for a movie that you won't soon forget. It blew my expectations out of the water and I would strongly recommend it to any music fan, as it completely changed my perspective on what even the biggest bands have to go through to continue doing what they love.",1437177600,,575,4.647058823529412

5842379,5,B00DPKQVVE,"This film was really great!  As a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars, I would have been interested in it even if it had only been a ""behind the music"" short, but trying to make a record while under the hammer of a lawsuit had to have been exquisitely painful.  The insight into the injustices perpetrated by the record labels upon the artists was a revelation.  This movie documents the journey of one band in its efforts to find fairness in a collapsing industry.  I imagine that most people believe that a record deal grants one instant professional and financial success, and now here's an incredibly popular, world-renowned band telling us, ""um...no.  Not really.""  Jared Leto has really shone a light on the business side of making music, not to mention the effects it can have on the artists' creative vibe.  Interviewing former employees of EMI, and other musical artists who had faced similar circumstances was a nice touch.  I would especially recommend this film to anyone out there trying to ""make it big"" in music.",1431648000,,1017,4.738636363636363

5842382,5,B00DPKQVVE,"One awesome documentary which every artist and every single upcoming artist must know what exactly the music or the artistic field is dependent on and the strengths and weaknesses of an artist, particularly a musician who would be a nice target for a record label company which love suing their artist for no particular reason to ruin the lives of talent! But ""sometimes we need to fight in order to be free"" because thats how you grow as an artist, because talent was never encouraged since then and even now! I know, this will be my 257th time I watched this movie but I specifically buy this because this helps an artist on how a true dreamer value's another dreamer's path and hard work!

This document definitely opened my eyes to a system that needs a lot of work. It is actually kind of sad that record deals work the way that they do, especially in a digital market--having to pay for shipping costs for music that is purchased on the internet--insane! It's crazy that things like that occur. I also am glad that artists are speaking out against these type of contracts that are so single-handedly one-sided that it's almost signing your life away to a record label.

On a happier note, I enjoyed watching them create This is War (one of my favorite CDs of all time) and enjoyed seeing all the creative work that an artist goes through for their love of music.",1421193600,,817,4.52027027027027

5842401,3,B00DPKQVVE,"Amazon recommended this back when their recommendations made sense. I love art-house work and Jared Leto is good art-house fodder. Letos acting has been uniformly entrancing since Fight Club, becoming increasingly impressive as he ages, but there was not much art-house in this film. Its a documentary about/advertisement for his band Thirty Seconds to Mars. I have mixed feelings about documentaries, they never dive deep enough for me, they really show the limits of the medium. I also have mixed feelings about rock music and the people who listen to it, and Im convinced that unless the music industry figures out a way to make people who pay 50 cents for two cups of water in an ugly plastic bottle pony up 99 cents for a song, rock music (and probably hip hop and country music) are going to go the way of folk music, and the people who like to that kind of art are going to feel even more disenfranchised and disengaged.
There are a few poignant moments that make Artifact worthwhile on a Sunday morning when theres no paperwork and the cat's asleep: Jared Leto arguing with his brother, drawing in the sand on the beach, getting awkward hugs from people who recognize him from his (surprise!) acting work. If you're interested in that part of his life but don't want to sit through a documentary, the music video Hurricane has a beautiful depiction of the emotional content of the events portrayed in Artifact and is more typical of what Ive come to expect from Jared Leto. Unfortunately, as of this writing, you can only buy ""Hurricane"" (the censored version) on iTunes. Come-on Amazon, you sell Nymphomaniac, but you don't sell Hurricane and Pagan Poetry?
Knowing Jared Leto, his next documentary is probably going be a lot more interesting, and by his third and fourth one, Ill be hooked.",1414886400,,1799,4.769230769230769

I had heard over the years about  business practices that were quite archaic being practiced in the music industry and it was refreshing to see it told in such a way that not only was it easy to follow and understand, but you felt the bands frustration as well.  This movie told two stories at the same time and each story line required the other to exist in order to come to the end that it did.  It fascinated me that some of my favorite songs  came from such a hard time in the bands lives.  Awesome documentary.  I would recommend anyone fans of Thirty Seconds to Mars or fans of Music watch this movie.  It would make you think twice about downloading that free song.",1409961600,,779,4.2517006802721085

Jared did a superb job of letting the viewer experience the stress, pain, and anger of an artist struggling to fight a near industry monopoly. Also amazing is witnessing the creative process of this truly artful band. Watching this process is even more mind blowing when on weighs the recording process with the finished product, the CD ""This Is War"".",1408579200,,460,4.691358024691358
5842476,5,B00DPKQVVE,"I bought this documentary a few months ago so I could learn more about the process of producing music. This documentary was super informative about who artists make and distribute their music; it gives a good overview of the current music industry, of which I knew very little. I watched the documentary twice to try to catch as much as I could, and I'd even want to watch it again! I love the style of the film: there is a good balance between interviews, music and just watching Thirty Seconds to Mars live their lives.

However, I must say that this was a bit of the ""Jared Leto show,"" since a lot of the film is spent zoomed in on his face and listening his conversations on speaker-phone. I feel like the film made the lawsuit seem like his battle alone, but I would've liked to see more of the other band members, Shannon and Tomo. But hey, I am sure that loads of people watch this film and listen to Mars music just because he's in it. ;-D

I'd certainly recommend this film to anyone who listens to music, especially to fans of Thirty Seconds to Mars. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1408320000,,1098,4.274038461538462

I love their music...I love Jared's acting. The film is very insightful to the workings of the music industry. Makes me feel good to be one of the people who actually still goes out and buys a cd...they put so much work into it...and still aren't getting paid.

I know wanting to pirate music isn't probably the best reaction to have after watching how EMI Screws 30STM (among all of it's other signed artists) as pirating music would probably just make things worse for the artists, but I just find it hard to stomache me giving them any of my money.

5842529,5,B00DPKQVVE,"Have been a huge 30STM fan from the beginning.  I don't think there's any middle ground with their music, either you love it or hate it.  :)  After their recent record breaking tour supporting the ""This is War"" album was waiting anxiously for the tour DVD.  Because of the pending lawsuit Jared decided to shift the release from a ""tour only"" to a ""documentary"".  It is a very interesting and powerful movie.  If you are a fan, musician, or anyone interested in what goes on in the industry it should be a must have/own.  For everyone else, highly recommend as a rental.  I'm quite sure that at least in regards to this production 30STM won't be short changed.

It ranges from some of their musical construction, and preparation, some behind the scenes, and much to do about the EMI/Virgin lawsuit.  If you are familiar with This is War, seeing how they produced it, and under what circumstances is just mind blowing.  Fans will love it, non-fans will be enlightened.  A win win for everyone.

Shout out to the echelon.",1398643200,,1019,4.625698324022347

5842534,4,B00DPKQVVE,"As a mere music fan with no connection the industry, I've read blurbs in Rolling Stone over the last few years about bands suing labels and labels suing bands, without understanding why.  Until I saw Artifact, I never knew the story behind any of these lawsuits.  Jared Leto does a fabulous job of weaving the story of Thirty Seconds to Mars being sued for 30 (irony) million dollars with the making of their album, This is War.  Peaceful moments of outstanding nature photography make the shocking story less painful to watch.

Artifact is an important documentation of a historic time in the music industry.  No one knows what the future of the recording industry holds.  Music won't go away, but the way it gets to listeners is constantly changing. Artifact will be a valuable resource in the study of whatever unfolds.  The fact that bands like Thirty Seconds to Mars can make little or no money from record sells really brings up some unsettling points.  When I buy an album, am I really supporting the label? How can I support the artists who make so many sacrifices to be heard?  Watching this film will give you a new appreciation for these artists and the thousands like them that are caught in the money wars of the recording industry.",1397088000,4,1245,4.674311926605505

5842602,5,B00DPKQVVE,This was an incredible documentary into the real world of what the music business is really about and has been for years. Kudos to Jared and the guys for having the courage to put it out there. I'm in the business so I've experienced this first hand. It is brutal. Very enlightening and for a documentary even captivating at times. The passion and talent that these guys possess goes unparalleled and should be taken more seriously by the labels.  A label is a big machine which has many working parts and it takes each part to make it run. Let's not forget the artists are equally as important. Super proud of the Louisiana boys and I wish the greatest of success to them as it's well deserved!!!!  Well done!!!!!,1394064000,,714,4.5271317829457365
5842603,3,B00DPKQVVE,"I only paid $0.99 for the rental, so it was not a total waste.  The documentary was interesting at first, but for me, one who is not completely into music or a musician, it got boring and I only watched about half.",1393977600,,214,4.095238095238095
5842604,5,B00DPKQVVE,"Jared Leto once again, under the guise of Bartholomew Cubbins, has shown us his craftiness in directing and producing video. Here, in this documentary film, he removes all fantasies and illusions of the so-called ""Record Biz"". We all have heard from other artists and seen as well what damages have been heinously done to artists..how they literally are raped repeatedly by the industry execs and left with almost nothing, if anything at all. However, this movie is the ULTIMATE and FINAL word on the subject as far as telling the viewer and showing the viewer everything they always wanted to know, but STILL would not want to know...or rather believe is TRUE. However...all UGLINESS is revealed and is extremely moving when you actually see the audacity and the idiocy of the record executives and said company and why an artist should just do everything grassroots themselves and be beholden to none. Exactly what the Echelon is and stands for is the total opposite of what EMI did and does to 30 seconds To Mars. Watch it...Learn!!!",1393891200,,1036,4.892045454545454

5842631,5,B00DPKQVVE,Been a fan of Jared for a long time but in this day and time it is surprising how naive artist are in the ways of the world and business. It is eye opening in the sense that artist need to pool their resources to combat the lack of business savvy required to survive in the dog eat dog world of music. The message is not doing battle with the corporate monster but to be smarter then them or stay out. I feel pain for these young guys who are so talented but so far out of their depth when it comes to using that talent. The next step for the industry is for the development of an artist owned and operated label guided buy sound business know how without the pretext exploiting talent for all it has without the worry of no reward.,1392940800,,732,4.090277777777778
5842632,5,B00DPKQVVE,"Corporate greed stiffling creativity, music distribution, the right of the artist to receive financial reward,etc.  This documentary was difficult to watch at times because of the deeply felt frustration of the artist and the endless harassment of the indifferent, power-hungry corporate giant -- indifferent because of the power wielded over the artist who is doing all he can to find an equitable end.  The documentary was excellently produced, displaying the beautiful, determined mind of Jared Leto and the faithful cohesion of the band members to stick it out until a fair conclusion could be reached.  This documentary opened my eyes to one of the most blatant practices of avarice and the resulting pressure put upon creative genius in the artistic world.  Everyone, everywhere needs and deserves to have music in their lives: and every songwriter deserves his/her rewards, both financial and recognition.

No monies have been seen to date by 30 seconds WTF its is amazing that the best criminals in our present society are some of the best educated people in society and while they could make really good money honestly and in a decent legitimate way they seem to enjoy doing everything with an egotistical bent to it GREED is not the only description for these individuals, personality disorders seem to be rampant with a good dose of kiss ass at any cost....win at any cost...I truly hope 30 Seconds to Mars some how will finally gets what is fair and financially owed to them .....and good luck to Jared Leto on the Academy Awards this man has worked long hard and has EARNED IT!",1392076800,,964,4.446327683615819

Watched with my 79 year old mother, 15 year old daughter, husband, sister...all ages, all levels of interest in music and the industry, and all enjoyed.  Very eye-opening, and left each of us wanting more.  Answered many questions about the industry, yet also found ourselves with many more questions as well.  Provocative, thought provoking, opened big discussion about commerce, trade, fairness, and in general the future of the music business.  What can be done now? What could have been done?

This movie takes on a bit of a twist because its actually more about 30 seconds to mars battle with their label EMI over contract disputes. I didn't like parts of the movie because it felt like more of a rehearsed movie in parts instead of a behind the scenes look at the band. The lead singer, Jared Leto, is a professional actor as well so that makes sense. Anyway, its worth watching once.",1391385600,2,501,4.456521739130435

5842673,5,B00DPKQVVE,"This documentary was very interesting. Really opens your eyes. We grow up thinking rock stars have a rock star life. We judge an artist when we think they ""sell-out"" rather than staying true to their original sound. Turns out they have a boss they have to keep happy just like us. The big difference? We get a regular paycheck and the ability to walk away whenever we want. For them..... it's like a hamster wheel they can never get off.

I was amazed at what they had to go through to get this lawsuit resolved.  I often use the internet to listen to old and new artists and often buy music from artists that appeal to me.

If you have ever wondered why your favorite artist has filed bankruptcy, this should give you some answers.  It's also an intimate look at the incredibly talented Jared Leto.  He is not only a wonderful actor, but a brilliant musician and businessman.  I can't leave out Shannon and Tomo who are both wonderful musicians.  The talent in those three men is overflowing and apparent in this film.  Well worth the price!",1390780800,,511,4.952941176470588
5842687,5,B00DPKQVVE,"When I set out to write this review, there were a LOT of things that I wanted to say.

One of them, being the fact that this very hard working band found themselves in this whole big mess--that they were being sued by their record label due to 'breach of contract'.

What also struck me was the part when Jared Leto (in a voice-over) explained how a typical record deal is structured.  I'll tell you, it's a LOT to take in, with me scratching my head at the part where the record label gets to take an 85% cut out of the profits. (And that will be in addition to other things--that Jared goes into length about explaining.)

I mean, I'm thinking 85%?  That's virtually EVERYTHING. And why???  So the execs can continue to afford their comfortable lifestyles.  Or is it to make payroll?

This part of the story (that does NOT get answered) remains a mystery.

Anyway, what doesn't remain a mystery is the fact that Jared, along with his brother Shannon and their bandmate Tomo, really work hard and really care about the music they make.

I mean, the documentary really shows how hard all of them work, to the point where you see Jared working in his pajamas!

I mean, from what I got to see, these guys have NOT gone Hollywood.  (I don't even think they have any interest in all of that--wherein you're going to see them boozing it out and falling apart and NOT keeping their end of the bargain.)

I mean, what's GREAT evidence of their work ethic, is that they are in the Guiness Book of World Records for having the longest tour of a rock band. I tell you, you can't have that kind of record being a screw-up!

Overall, the documentary says a lot. For me, the most compelling were the parts where you got to know Jared and Shannon when they were coming up. That insight, was the REAL gift.

The movie is truly a document of a band trying to do the right thing, looking for their label to do the same with them.

And in the end, what's so wrong with that?

I mean, really what is the problem folks???

Watch and enjoy!!!",1390262400,2,2021,4.329787234042553
5842688,5,B00DPKQVVE,"The fact that they had to be creative throughout this mess is cruel and unusual punishment.

And yet, they made one of my all-time favorite albums. I loved seeing the ins and outs of the business as well as the creative aspect. Jared and Shannon have a great relationship, but you can see that they can hurt one another too. It's gotta be tough to be in a band with your sibling, no matter how close you are. Tomo seems like he's a really good guy too.

I know I'll be watching this many more times.",1390089600,,499,4.1875
5842689,5,B00DPKQVVE,"Thought it was a great documentary. I liked how several former EMI execs were interviewed. Also, they didn't just straight up bash record labels and EMI for doing what they did, but provided background info of what was happening during 2008 as well as the changes that EMI was going through because of Guy Hand. Also they did a good job of explaining typical record deals and stating the current problems and challenges faced by record labels. Overall it was fairly balanced.",1389830400,,475,4.804878048780488

The film depicts what I'm sure most (if not all) bands go through (and have always gone through) with being exploited by their record companies. In the early days, it was even worse than it is today. I'm not sure the solution to the problem is a simple one but it seems clear that someone needs to come up with a better and more fair way of handling ways of everyone sharing in the money an artist brings in, besides the record label getting their cut (and then some) before anyone else (including the artist). At least this film highlights just how ridiculous the system is...which (to me), is the first step towards addressing the issue. Sure, they are not the first bands to experience this problem...nor sue their record label...but this documentary by them deserves all the praise the critics have given it.",1389139200,,980,4.45

5842723,5,B00DPKQVVE,"This film incited a full range of emotions in me. I went from school girl giddy at seeing my favorite band behind the scenes, being themselves and working their magic, to full blown anger at EMI for dragging them through the mud, and all in between.  I pumped my fists to the sky when EMI finally caved, and dropped my jaw when I saw (**spoiler alert**) that they have yet to receive a dime for albums sold.
I've followed 30 Seconds to Mars from the beginning, seen them live multiple times, and I say now with the same conviction I had way back when they started- these are 3 of the hardest working, most loyal, and most talented guys I've ever come across.  The struggles with the label were like a beaurocratic fist up the ass, and none of the hard work or talent mattered to EMI when money and contracts were on the table. The music business is a faceless machine powered by greed.  All that being said, this is a beautiful film, and Jared has an amazing eye for this type of thing.  Whether you are a fan of this band or not, it will make you look at things differently.  I highly recommend giving it a watch.",1388448000,10,1114,4.285714285714286

I have seen them in person perform three times so far. I saw them live in 2010 for ""This is War Tour"" and 2013 for ""Love Lust Faith Dreams tour"" twice.  Watching this documentary about the struggle of putting out "" This Is War makes,"" me understand the ablum so much more. To understand the meaning behind every song and what they were fighting for. It makes sense of it all, the name of the ablum, the intent and the meaning behind it all. I am glad that we as Echelons we were able to see a different side of the band!

I had heard of jared leto and 30 seconds to mars before but hadnt really gotten into the scene of their music and wasn't overly familiar with their work. This film is a justifiably harsh critique of the music business and the record labels using long form contracts to exploit and screw over their artists. I am one who likes to hear both sides of the story but the facts, not just the opinions, are what they are. This film is an indictment of the old model of business for the music industry and its people like macklemore who are producing their own albums or artists like incubus, 30 seconds to mars, etc who are willing to try circumvent the system in a digital age in which that is absolutely a viable option who are going to change the industry forever.

At no point during the documentary did I get bored, lose interest, or feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The members of Thirty Seconds to Mars demonstrate enormous restraint hanging in there and holding their ground. Is there anything these guys CANT do? This documentary was also a brilliant opportunity to view the music industries grubby, hidden, skeletons.  Artifact also gave you a glance at how creative ideas come together through truly difficult and complex moments. Most public have an impression about famous people being arrogant, wanting more money because they think theyve earned it, or just being greedy. Artifact definitely has me believe they earn every million they make.  Much like their songs, Artifact is up for interpretation.",1386979200,,808,5.3046875
5842778,5,B00DPKQVVE,If you're a musician looking to sign a record deal I highly recommend watching this documentary. It goes into detail how the music industry tries to take every penny they can from the artist; a practice that should be regulated. I hope this will also educate those fans who feel the artist should give everything away for free. The music industry is a business after all.,1386806400,,371,4.636363636363637
5842779,5,B00DPKQVVE,Delves into aspects of the music industry I have never contemplated. Informative and thought provoking. Allows those who download  albums (and movies alike) illegally off the internet  to think about the entire scenario and who exactly it affects in the long run. Definitely worth watching.,1386806400,,290,5.4222222222222225

5842781,5,B00DPKQVVE,Informative and captivating. Great insight into modern music industry. Enjoyed watching the making of one of the greatest albums ever!,1386720000,,134,5.75

5842783,5,B00DPKQVVE,"What started as a ""making of"" film for 'This Is War', became this eye-opening documentary that offers the viewer insight into the music industry. Through amazing interviews with multiple artists (Chester Bennington, Serj Tankian, Brandon Boyd) and former label executives, we are shown how ruthless the industry can be. The film shows Jared, Shannon and Tomo recording their band's third album while fighting their record label for U$30 million. An otherwise private band, Thirty Seconds to Mars share their stories and thoughts and give us access to a very turbulent and difficult time in their lives, proving that hard work pays off, that you must fight for what you believe in and that, in the words of director/frontman Jared Leto (aka Bartholomew Cubbins), ""sometimes you must fight in order to be free"". The result from winning this war with EMI is an incredible and powerful album that has sold millions of copies worldwide and the brilliant piece of art that is ARTIFACT. Watched it five times, will watch it another five times and will attend a screening in January. It is THAT good. A must watch, even if you're not into their music (which you should be, because they're beyond amazing).",1386547200,11,1197,4.960199004975125

8596045,5,B00DPKQVVE,Great watch! It was very informative and I felt like I got to get to know the band a bit better. The documentary also helped me to appreciate the album This is War so much more.,1523145600,,177,3.9444444444444446
8596046,5,B00DPKQVVE,"I love the fact that these guys are REAL!!!! They want their music heard, by the fans! It is a sad fact that artist really can't make a living doing what they love and get paid as they should; for hard work, album sales, concerts, ect. The internet has killed the music business! That's why I'm a married MOM of four and sale insurance.  I will never be able to support my family by writing, singing, and playing the piano.  I would love too, but reality is that, I would never be able to allow a label to tell me how to write play and sing MY SONGS, and then not even pay me for it.  So I sit at home with my notebook, play my songs to my loved ones and they love it!  When I'm gone they can do with it as they wish.  For now I can just listen to Thirty Seconds Tao Mars, and know I've done well!",1515542400,,797,3.8950617283950617

8596048,3,B00DPKQVVE,I thought it was going to be more of a documentary of the entire music industry but it's literally just about 30 Seconds to Mars. I get the industry sucks and this was their experience but it would've been better if multiple experiences were covered. I got bored.,1505952000,,263,4.5

8596052,5,B00DPKQVVE,I love this film. It is so sad to hear about how badly artists are treated by the record labels!,1493683200,,96,3.85
8596053,4,B00DPKQVVE,I'm not a huge Jared Leto fan at the same time though this is a very interesting documentary about just how incredibly screwed up the music industry isit basically needs a complete overhaul and they have great interviews and you can watch the process of making an album and see what bands go through to do it especially with the tyrant mentality of the major record label system undermining the best intentions of people like Jaret Leto,1486512000,,436,4.675324675324675
