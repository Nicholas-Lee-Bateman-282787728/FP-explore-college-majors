8304571,4,B001G9CNV8,I enjoyed this DVD. Michael Fremer makes this very interesting!,1431216000,,63,5.4
8304572,4,B001G9CNV8,"I like this video. It gives a clear intro to the basics about vinyl in production stages and caring for your own records. I somewhat agree with the comments on the quality of the production and video in general. But then again, it is not really important for the message that Michael is putting out.

It is a great introduction to anyone getting into the vinyl world.

Only thing I could have wished for is some more on the differences between vinyl and digital when it comes to sound quality and the production methods for the two in the studio. But maybe that is for a later video (that I will buy if it shows up.)",1422748800,,616,4.301724137931035
8304573,5,B001G9CNV8,"Fremer has probably forgotten more about vinyl that any of us could ever hope to learn. This, his second DVD, is a wealth of information that can help anyone interested in vinyl music and record collecting. Tours of pressing plants in Germany and California are intermixed with sections on cleaning, storing, and playback of records. It was very informative. I purchased this as my first to view because of another Amazon recommendation so I can't address what is new or different from the first DVD. But as an aspiring audiophile with long term interests in the hobby, I can endorse this DVD as a worthwhile purchase. For example, Fremer discusses how to use a brush on the record before playback. He notes that even a respected audiophile friend of his didn't know so he takes the time to explain to us, his viewer. The real meat of this is the long finish, where Fremer pulls out a bunch of records at random to talk about what features people look for when collecting records, discuss some basics regarding how we can tell first pressings apart, and so forth.

Note though, that the production value is what you'd expect for what seems like a self-published endeavor: at times the audio suffers from the background noise in the pressing plants he tours. It isn't a terrible audio track, let me clear. There are no annoying drops, harsh sounds, or inaudible dialogue. It was more of a nit pick. The editing and the chapter headings before each section are a little campy, but never problematic.

All in all, it's a great resources for new and veteran record collectors, vinyl junkies, and audiophiles. Get it.",1420761600,,1612,4.753571428571429
8304574,1,B001G9CNV8,"Don't buy. Let alone this guy is a complete jerk. Look up his name on the net and you'll see him ranting and raving with paranoia.

He's also associated with Stereophile which I wouldn't buy either. His disgrace to this industry and yet somehow has forced his way into being the face of it. I guess you'd consider him the Nancy Grace of vinyl.",1397606400,,343,4.359375
8304575,3,B001G9CNV8,"Vinyl guru and contributor to Stereophile magazine and other publications, Michael Fremer, put out this successor of sorts to an earlier 2005 effort.  The original instructional video dealt mostly with how to set up a turntable.

Here, much of the 3 hour video shows how vinyl records are made.  He takes us on a tour of a German company and another from California.  How much of that interest you is...well, up to you.  For me, it was more than I cared about.  Obviously, Fremer is fanatical about all things vinyl and is more than happy to show you samples from his vast record collection.  Again, a little goes a long way when it comes to his interest in collectible records.  He does spend some time telling viewer who are interested in ""collecting"" to learn more about a records value which can differ greatly depending on who mastered the recording or where it was pressed.

What interested me mostly was instruction on cleaning vinyl.  He shows us a couple examples of record cleaning machines that he owns, but sometimes his attention to detail gets in the way of a coherent presentation.  Fremer goes to great length to show us how to properly handle a record but then when he's showing off his collection, he fumbles around with several albums in his hand or tucked under his arm.  Is this DVD worth buying?  Up to you of course, but it is available on Netflix.",1371600000,4,1371,4.615702479338843
8304576,4,B001G9CNV8,"I enjoyed this video.  Michael Fremer was engaging as he presented many aspects of vinyl records: manufacturing, LP care and cleaning, record collecting, etc.",1368576000,,158,5.583333333333333
8304577,1,B001G9CNV8,"This is a man obviously obsessed with vinyl records, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I am a fan of vinyl myself, and was interested in learning something about cleaning and preserving my vinyl collection.  However, while well-intentioned, this disc provided almost no useful information.  He did provide some info on the storage units he was using, which I thought was useful, and he also explained how older records get that white ring on the outside of the album sleeve (packing them in too tight).  But outside of that, there were very few real recommendations on the cleaning process, just a lot of rambling around; it was almost painful to watch.  His presentation reminded me of Phil Hartman's portrayal of an anal obsessive lunch bag collector on Saturday Night Live.  Not recommended.",1316736000,6,810,5.007462686567164
8304578,5,B001G9CNV8,"I was dubious at first.  What could he include in this disc that wasn't in the first DVD?  Turns out, a lot.  In fact, I might recommend THIS disc FIRST!

Why?  Because the first disc has great stuff about turntable setup, that really helps lots more than a written description.  But most new users are going to start with a turntable that already has the cartridge included -- so these setup steps are largely for more advanced vinyl lovers.  They are important and you should get both discs eventually.  But start with the second one, this one.

Why?  This disc has the critical stuff related to cleaning and playing and storing records.  This is important for everyone, especially people who are new to vinyl, or haven't been into it for a while, or never stopped but are willing to learn something new.

And, of course, there are also segments about record production, just like the first edition.  The facets of production covered here might very well be more interesting for a novice than the first DVD.

Both discs are very good and contain information you won't see in any other videos about vinyl.  But if you are only getting one, get this one.",1284249600,5,1154,4.615763546798029
8304579,4,B001G9CNV8,"Well, I was a big fan of Michael Fremers last DVD, so for me this was a must have. This time around he delves into further untouched aspects of this fun hobby of vinyl records. (and I don't even have a turntable...yet) He covers how records are made with trips to pressing plants, and shows how the laquers are plated, records pressed and packaged, and an exstensive discusion on how to clean records and the materials and equipment used. He also gets into some basics of record collecting, why people do it, and what some of the things people look for. It's always entertaining and educational as well. If you don't have his first video, buy that one first. This one is really in addition to the material covered in the first DVD.

The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because of the production quility. At times the video quality isn't quite what the last disk was. (Older footage not considered) I also always wanted to see his personal stereo, and have him play something on it, but he doesn't play any actual music because he says he doesn't have permission to...So why not get permission to? Music is what it's all about right? I the first disk, he at least shows you his turntable. A worthwhile buy though, and educational even if you don't own a turntable yourself. Vinyl is making a comeback!",1237248000,19,1307,4.491596638655462
