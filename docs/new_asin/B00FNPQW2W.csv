6015614,4,B00FNPQW2W,"The first episode isn't necessarily worth purchasing.  It tells us that originally slavery was not racist and the first African Americans worked and travelled with Europeans.  Then the Whites took away property rights from African American landowners ....

The first episode is worth purchasing for Dr. Gates' face when he listens to white people talk about slavery.  It is very painful and remember that Dr. Gates previously hosted the geneology series where he traced the ancestry of many American celebrities including YoYo Ma which echoed the tolerance and graciousness and kindness I have experienced from African Americans when they complimented me on my Chinese background especially the retention of our language.  This is painful when I remember my parents watching Roots when it first aired on television and we learned that African Americans were denied their names and heritage which preceded the exact same violent erasure that the Japanese invaders enforced on the Corean people.

It's interesting that Princess Diana is descended from George Washington who owned slaves and I think it indicates more an aristocratic breaking away from the King of England's control to form one's own serfdom that refuses to kickback to the English rather than some miraculous high ideal of human rights - that's why the POTUSes of yore owned slaves.  There's no cult of George Washington the way there is for Abe Lincoln.

The use of enslaved African Americans to supplant Native American populations echoes the utilization by the British colonialists of Indians and Nepalese over native or local Chinese in Asia.  From Chinese accounts, there was no sympathy for the Chinese by the Indian and Nepalese who relished having power over the Chinese - it made them feel better about the British.  That also may be why the Koreans lower soldiers were reported by local Chinese and Western POWs as being brutal and seeking the opportunity to strike at the Chinese and Western POWs while the Koreans themselves were being wronged by the Japanese.

And these people go to Church?  I'm not a Christian but I went to Catholic school for more than a decade so I know they KNOW better and these cartoons are ....

The promise of the first episode was followed by a very good second episode.  After reading Russell Shorto's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amsterdam-A-History-of-the-World-s-Most-Liberal-City/dp/0385534574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City</a>&nbsp;and how the Dutch needed a lie to invade England (more a German and Japanese thing than a straightforward no apologies Viking thing, nu?), I am wondering if the following episodes will give us any clues about whether the American CIVIL war was actually a war agains the European ARISTOCRATS including England's desire to use the fertile Southern cotton planting states as overseas cash cows placing operatives as the plantation and slave owners so it wouldn't matter how many good Americans freed slaves, England would always ship more.  England controlled the shipping of the African Americans to the Americas.  They may not have had their fingerprints on the whips and chains and the bodies of the African women but they were responsible - something they don't mention in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually/dp/B001JIFYSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually</a>&nbsp;and maybe that is why Cary Elwes was cast in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-The-Girls/dp/B001RN2LGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss The Girls</a>&nbsp;which used slave quarters in the South as the setting.

6015649,5,B00FNPQW2W,"This was the most informative and eye opening documentary I have viewed. As a white American growing up in a racially segregated society I began to change my ""Jim Crow"" views while serving in Vietnam with a disproportionate number of Black Americans. I say that because many more young black men were unable to ""avoid"" the draft than their white counterparts. Service along side my black brothers allowed me to realize the prejudices I had been carefully taught while growing up were just that, prejudices. In spite of this I still did not have a full grasp of the injustices they had endured in their lives compared to my own. This documentary has allowed me to see the gross disadvantages blacks have endured compared to my own. Someone in an earlier review stated this should be required for all young people especially black youth. I agree it should be required for all youth but believe it more important for white youth. Not only to see what can be overcome and accomplished in spite of adversity but also to gain an understanding of the disparity in opportunities.",1488153600,,1071,4.763440860215054

6015661,5,B00FNPQW2W,"This is an engaging and highly informative series on a lot of history I didn't learn about in school. As a mentor of mine recently said, most of African American history was 20 minutes of study in an hour long class in a year long curriculum. It is largely under-emphasized and ignored and as a result, I was simply ignorant of much of this history. But while this focuses on the African American history, it reveals much about our shared experience (though from a different side). I am so glad I watched it and I recommend it to others as a great starting point of study.

The format is fast moving, the content is engaging and ranges from incredibly serious to light hearted and funny. One thing that it remains all the way through, though, is human and honest. It tells history through the human stories of history, and as a result I found myself not just learning about the events of our nation's past, but relating to and empathizing with the unlikely and largely unknown heroes that rose up out of those events. It has also helped me understand our current national racial struggles in a new way as I can see a little better how the shared history of African Americans really does continue today. Even though the stones of slavery, Jim Crow, 40 acres and a mule, the great migration, and the tension between King and Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, and Black Harlem (to name just a bare few) were tossed in the pond of national experience in our past, the ripples of those events continue to shake our culture today.

My only complaint about this series was that it was too short. It left me wanting to learn more about our history and the important people whose stories have largely not been told. I guess that is, in the end, a good thing because it prompts me to more study. But I would love to see them release a second season!

If you are interested in learning more about history, understanding more about the tensions that are gripping our country today, or just love a good human story - you should watch this. I can't recommend it highly enough especially if you haven't spent much time looking into the rich and vibrant history of the African American experience.",1480636800,6,2170,4.530612244897959

6015740,5,B00FNPQW2W,"I just recently watched this PBS Documentary by Henry Louis Gates on Netflix & it really &  truly touched my heart & soul.
There were things in this documentary that I did not know because some of the history of the African American is not fully told. A lot of us thought Slavery started back in the 1600 and for some the 1800 hundreds when it goes all the way back to the 1500 hundreds. This is an awesome documentary that should be placed in the schools, the colleges, and in one's personal collection. It would make an awesome gift and is something I would share with my children & grandchildren. I would recommend this documentary to anyone that is looking for an accurate account of the history of a people that fought so hard to be identified as humans and to have the freedom of others. It is a shame when human beings have the same color of ""Blood"" flowing thru their veins but are told that they are less than an animal because of the color of their skin. I salute you Mr. Gates for all your time & effort you put into presenting the ""Truth"" to me and the rest of the world. Let Freedom & Equality Prevail!",1432771200,5,1115,4.2843601895734595

Similarly, I found the early phase of post civil war reconstruction history (pre-Jim Crow) to be a revelation, the way the country was moving in a good direction before it reversed everything. So was the history of the Great Migration which so affected the Northern cities I grew up in. I learned a lot of other details Anout American history, and ended up in awe of what African Americans got through, which was the whole point of the series.  Really well done.",1429401600,3,744,4.7

Not many, and Henry Louis Gates does nothing less than help us understand that we can do what we need to do because there is nothing that we cannot do.

The facts are explained very well and have given me a much needed truthful understanding of my African American history. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD set to all African Americans to see and study. I viewed it three times so far and each time I have viewed it more astounding facts become clearer and more understood. We really need to know our history, it helps us to have more pride in our race and to have more courage to continue to over come present and future adversities.

6015900,4,B00FNPQW2W,"Many Rivers To Cross is an impressive and well presented documentary that is well worth the investment and time. There are so many points covered in the allotted time of ( just under six hours ) , that it would be unrealistic to think that all of the subjects could be covered comprehensively. For example, the period covering the years 1865 - 1892, was without question, one of the harshest periods for blacks in the U. S., but for time restraint issues or whatever, hardly any time is devoted to the Reconstruction Period. The six hours zip by rather swiftly as Mr. Gates, acting as your tour guide, gets to spend a substantial amount of time on camera, taking the viewer to the sites of many of the events depicted. For what it's worth, the entirety of this offering is commendable, the historians that are interviewed offers insights into most of the subjects, unfortunately, many of those who were there to live and be a part of these events ( with the exception of John Lewis and Denise Nash ) are no longer around. This in essence is what I would term or refer to as a sampler, small morsels assembled to highlight some major periods of American History that simply could not be found in the class room of any school I knew of. There are many volumes available today that delve deeper and offer a more lengthy and comprehensive overview of Black History, from "" Africans In America, Reconstruction, The Second Civil War, Freedom Riders up to and including the very best of them all, Eyes On The Prize"". These would be the ones I would recommend for those who are seriously interested in the knowledge and insight these pieces offer. It is sad to admit, that there are fewer numbers now interested in the plight and history of the black struggle in America and it is rewarding to see something like this come along. On the whole, this was a wonderful effort ( oh, and I loved that vintage automobile being driven during the show, a Packard ? ). For all the struggles and rivers and bridges that have been crossed, don't deceive yourself into thinking you've reached the promised land, but watching this film and others like it ( Voices Of Civil Rights ) gives one hope that we have indeed come a great distance, but by no means have we put the last river or bridge behind us. This is a must have for as Adam Clayton Powell once said, "" Not just for black Americans, but for all Americans interested in democracy "", and on that, I totally agree",1399852800,34,2449,4.50561797752809

Towards the 4th through 6th episodes, however, you will want the length of the documentaries to be much longer to cover all the people and events given short shrift.

8617263,5,B00FNPQW2W,"I really feel this should be required viewing in high school. Most curricula spends a day or maybe a couple of days on the history of African Americans in America, but that leaves out so much. For as well read as I like to pretend I am, there are SO many things I don't know. Even more importantly, watching this gives me an insight into how we've gotten to the point we have today, and ways it can be turned back. The injustice, intolerance and violence African Americans have had to endure at the hands of the White people in this country should, if not shame, then at least cause you to have more empathy for what they have endured and we should all feel pride in all theyve accomplished in spite of it.
Even if you didn't have southern, slaveholder ancestors or if your ancestors came over after the civil war, (which is how I used to comfort myself into thinking I bore minimal responsibility) it's likely that your family and/or way of life profited either directly or indirectly at the expense of African Americans.
This series is well written, interesting and thought provoking. Its sad and heartbreaking at times, but also has funny moments. Lest you think its a one-sided big white-bashing series, it most certainly is not. It is as fair as it can be, presenting the facts and not getting bogged down in too much sentimentality and rose-colored glasses nostalgia for the good old days.
As a final note, Henry Louis Gates Jr. is a great host and the historians and experts he talks to are very enjoyable to watch.
I highly recommend this series to anyone with an interest in how weve gotten to the point we have in America today, and what we must do to keep progressing forward, not regressing into the self- destructive, self-defeating actions of the past.",1521158400,2,1766,4.591772151898734
