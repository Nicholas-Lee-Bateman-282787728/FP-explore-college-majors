4175809,5,B003R2BWJG,We picked this dvd up to entertain our 3 year old on a long car ride to grandma's.  This series is from the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation).  It kept him happily transfixed for many hours.  The dvd runs just over 4 hours and is divided into 10 30 minute episodes.  Each episode will contain a couple of mysteries.  THe characters use problem solving and logic to solve little mysteries around the town (one is example is a smoke alarm that keeps going off) . Very sweet little dvd - highly recommend for for anyone looking for a dvd for a child 3-5.,1290902400,11,557,4.421568627450981
4175810,5,B003R2BWJG,"Busytown Mysteries with Richard Scarry characters Your favorite characters from Richard Scarry's incredible books come to life in front of your child's eyes. Always teaching a bit about the world of everyday life, the little characters are adored by children everywhere who don't even realize they are learning as they watch. A must for your pre-schoolers.",1280016000,9,356,5.375
4175831,4,B003R2BWJG,"I bought this after Netflix dropped the series.  My three grandkids love the stories, especially the 18-month old (who does his best at pronouncing Huckle and Busytown!)  We will probably wear out the DVD before the kids all outgrow it.  It competes well with Mickey's Clubhouse and various superhero stories.",1433980800,,309,5.14
4175832,5,B003R2BWJG,These are GREAT!  The family 5 year olds just love them.,1432512000,,56,4.090909090909091

4175837,5,B003R2BWJG,"The Busytown Mysteries series is really great for 4-6 year old children.  But this DVD is disk one of the ""Busytown Mysteries: You & Me Solve a Mystery"" 3 disk set.  At a similar price, buy the bigger set and this disk plus 2 more!!!",1425772800,3,233,4.155555555555556
4175838,5,B003R2BWJG,"All four kids (ages 9 and under) love Busytown Mysteries.  Since we moved, we haven't had access to the videos, so they were delighted to receive a DVD of several episodes.  My 9 year old is outgrowing the series, but I've heard him hum the theme song when trying to remember the ""question words"" - who, what, when, why, where - for his grammar lessons.",1424822400,,353,4.415384615384616
4175839,5,B003R2BWJG,"Long, long dvd but even my two year old grandson will sit and watch it.  There are lots of smaller segments so it keeps their interest even if they don't sit through the entire thing at one time.  I purchased it because we have a Busytown Cars and Trucks and Things that Go book and needed a break from the daily reading of it.  This did the trick.",1424217600,,348,4.088235294117647

4175854,5,B003R2BWJG,"This is something I used to watch as a youngster, and my son loves it! It gets the kids thinking, and has catchy tunes. The pros: Has catchy tunes. The kids learn a lot. Perfect for ages 2+. Has a lot of episodes. The cons: They may not want to stop watching the shows. They may sing the songs over and over again. All in all, it's an awesomely put together DVD.",1416700800,,362,4.041666666666667
4175855,5,B003R2BWJG,"There's not too many wholesome options out on the market today.  I remembered seeing a few of these Busytown shows when I was younger and after someone gave us a Richard Scarry book (that talked about manners and such) I was sold on the series and wanted to try out some shows for our daughters.  They LOVE these episodes.  I really like that these ""mysteries"" encourage them in the critical thinking process... it's not just a cartoon of empty ""entertainment'.  I highly recommend Busyworld of Richard Scarry books and shows!",1414108800,,526,4.811111111111111

4175858,5,B003R2BWJG,"This show is colorful and sweet just like the big Richard Scarry books. My daughter is six and has been enjoying these DVDs for a few years. Her big brother who is 12 will watch it with her without complaints, and the only other show they can agree on is Wild Kratts.
This particular DVD has ten episodes as compared to the usual six, so it is a great value.  I also don't think CBS airs this show on Saturday morning anymore.",1389139200,,426,4.195121951219512
4175859,5,B003R2BWJG,This is a good show for little kids that gets them thinking. My daughter loves this show. I think this is all the episodes for the series. Worth every penny.,1386633600,,157,4.266666666666667

4175883,5,B003R2BWJG,"This is a nice throwback to educational animation before a lot of the 3D rendering came into style. My son adores this show. It presents a nice way to learn deductive reasoning skills with everyday ""mysteries."" This was definitely the biggest surprise I've had in searching for educational entertainment.",1363737600,,304,5.224489795918367
4175884,5,B003R2BWJG,"Great way for kids to learn and it's even nice for the older kids, too, if they like to solve mysteries.  It teaches logical thinking, how to hone in on clues and actually solve a mystery - good skills for kids to have for school and life.

4175886,3,B003R2BWJG,"Kids are better judges than I, but I found it a bit dumb.  It seems to me that kids' books should be more realistic and imaginative -- like have real life people in imaginative stories.  Like maybe including what life of insects and foreign lands are really like.",1329868800,,263,4.458333333333333

4175888,4,B003R2BWJG,"Our children enjoyed ""Busytown Mysteries: You & Me Solve a Mystery"" so much that we decided to purchase this one to add to our Richard Scarry collection. The videos are just like the books coming to life with all of the cute and colorful characters that children love.

The mysteries stories on this DVD are light and entertaining, just perfect to engage preschoolers and also pique the interest of older children (we have an 8 year old son that loves watching, too). The music is just right - fun and lighthearted - no loud rock or obnoxious hip hop like you see in some children's movies and TV shows.

My only complaint is that I wish they had not included the two episodes about a mummy and a lake monster. Why do people put subject matter like that on DVD's for young children? They can get spooked really easily!

All in all, a great DVD, and one we enjoy over and over. Rest assured, if you love the books you'll loves the Busytown DVD's.",1324425600,5,945,4.419540229885057

8403074,1,B003R2BWJG,"If you are used to classic busytown and that is what you are looking for don,t buy this. I was looking for some low key calm stories for my children such as Lilly bunny's counting day, busy people, learning songs, and Richard Scarry's abc's. Needless to say the music and animation does not resemble the busytown I am familiar with or looking for. I will not be purchasing more unless it is classic.",1508716800,,399,4.47945205479452
