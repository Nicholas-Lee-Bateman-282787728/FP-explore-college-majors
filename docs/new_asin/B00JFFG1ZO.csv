8650526,3,B00JFFG1ZO,Doesn't play on my Mac or PC. Bought this to use with my laptop since the room with my pole doesn't have a tv. Seems like a great video but it can only be used on a dvd player so it's no use to me now.,1462406400,,201,3.391304347826087
8650527,4,B00JFFG1ZO,Bought this for my wife and she loved it. I like how heavy and study it feels. That means you can do pretty much anything with this.,1448841600,,132,3.925925925925926
8650528,5,B00JFFG1ZO,"I bought this because i realized I didn't have nearly enough strength to do any of the beginner pole videos. I was in shape but my arms couldn't bear my weight on the pole. I hurt my neck the first time so had to do some conditioning, which is why I bought this. I've been doing there video three times a week for three weeks and it is exactly what I needed. I'm still gaining strength but have been able to practice actual moves now. This video just focuses on moves you can use to condition your arms and legs, different grips and developing grip strength, and some fancier moves. There is no dancing or routines in this video though, which was fine. I would highly recommend if you're trying to get fit for pole.",1435190400,10,715,4.303703703703704
8650529,1,B00JFFG1ZO,This was a horrible video very poor quality don't waste your money or your time.,1419638400,,80,4.4
8650530,1,B00JFFG1ZO,Let me just say when I opened my box I was very disappointed and turned away because my dvd came in a paper sleeve. I know thats nothing to complain about but seriously when you spend 20$ on a dvd the least they could do is put it in a case. Usually when a dvd is in a paper sleeve it means its a bootleg. Plus the dvd wouldnt play very well in any of my players.,1417651200,4,363,3.727272727272727
8650531,5,B00JFFG1ZO,Great if you are looking for conditioning to do outside of pole class.,1404604800,3,70,4.461538461538462
