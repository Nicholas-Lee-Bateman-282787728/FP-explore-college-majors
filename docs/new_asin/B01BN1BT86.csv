8750769,2,B01BN1BT86,"***WARNING: SPOILERS*** First off, this film is S.....L.....O.....W. Second, it starts at the wrong point in the story. It never shows what brought Lila and Janek together in the first place. We never see them in a loving relationship. Lila is, quite frankly, a b! tch on wheels and I can't understand why Janek is so crazy about her that he would kill for her. Then, after Janek has killed the girl he was ""unfaithful"" with, we find out all he did was KISS her. What kind of insane person asks someone to kill a girl just because he kissed her? And what kind of insane boy would do it? As another reviewer mentioned, Lila comes from a broken home, but that doesn't come even CLOSE to being a reason for her to behave this way. She and Janek must have had some kind of codependent relationship - which the movie never shows, so the viewer has no way of judging that except by Janek's actions after the fact. A very flawed movie. I stopped about two-thirds of the way through and watched the rest the next day. And please note I don't mind subtitles, I have absolutely no problem with that, but I do have a problem with bad movies.",1530144000,,1130,4.360189573459715
