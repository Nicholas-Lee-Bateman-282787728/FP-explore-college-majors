8227440,4,B000X9LSYU,"Glad I purchased it. Nice to watch possibly the best NCAA men's basketball game ever played.

Would have liked some more commentary before the game, at half time, and a recap after the game. It's also in Full Screen or standard screen. Big black bars on either side of the TV.

The above issues notwithstanding, it was fun to watch.",1482019200,,332,4.516666666666667
8227441,4,B000X9LSYU,This is just the video of the game and leaves out the amazing post-game scene.,1444608000,,78,4.266666666666667
8227442,4,B000X9LSYU,"Greatest Game Ever.  I miss the time outs, chit  chat. and the half time show.  Also the post game interviews.",1408060800,,110,4.4
8227443,5,B000X9LSYU,"I still remember details about the night I watched this game.  The back and forth scoring was unbelievable.  Unbelievable talent on the floor.  Terrific, well-known ending was just perfect!",1394755200,,189,5.448275862068965
8227444,5,B000X9LSYU,"I HATE basketball so I cant review this, but I can tell you my husbands face lit up like a Christmas tree when he found this as his present :)",1389139200,,142,3.7666666666666666
8227445,4,B000X9LSYU,"The video is very good quality tho there could be better transitions from game spot to game spot where the commercials & half time were removed. At times it seems some seconds were missing, so made game somewhat difficult to follow precisely.  Also the audio changes volume at times.  Over all glad I bought it but feel it is somewhat over priced for the quality of the production.",1368230400,,381,4.588235294117647
8227446,4,B000X9LSYU,I just would like it to include maybe some replays at the end and a longer ending to discuss what happened. see where media took this now but how was it celebrated then.,1365811200,,169,4.151515151515151
8227447,5,B000X9LSYU,"Fantastic game. Both teams played their hearts out. Would have been nice to add interviews after the game, but the game tells the story. Still one of the best games ever. And it helps I've been a Duke fan from the 70'. Go Duke!",1363564800,,227,4.181818181818182
8227448,3,B000X9LSYU,"I was an early 90s basketball fan and particularly of Mashburn.  Great game, played at a pretty frenetic pace.  The quality of the disc is good, but no half time or post game is shown as the game ends promptly after the buzzer.  Laettner and Mash dominated their respective teams, Hurley didn't have a great game, but a young Grant Hill showed why he would be a top draft pic.  Kentucky basically had a team of no namers besides Mash, but the supporting cast made some great plays regardless.  Excellent game for any bball fan with high scoring percentage from both teams - but greatest ever NCAA game may be stretching it though!",1224806400,,630,4.539823008849558
8227449,4,B000X9LSYU,"It was great to watch ""the shot"" over and over again.  This is a great DVD to add to any Duke fans collection.  One disappointing thing about the video is there are no interviews, no pregame, halftime, or postgame  highlights or commentary, the video is only the game.  After Laetnner hits ""the shot"" you see Thomas Hill's reaction and then the video ends, it would have been much better if the video included some highlights and reactions to the finish.",1201132800,5,454,4.6375
