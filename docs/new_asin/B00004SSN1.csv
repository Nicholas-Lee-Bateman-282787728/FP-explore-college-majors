Thank you.",1442448000,,164,3.657142857142857
7921870,3,B00004SSN1,"Yet another ridiculous product aimed to take advantage of those foolish enough to own cats.  Naturally, my cat-loving spouse Bessie insisted on getting this great ""two-for-one"" deal (something she has refused when suggested by yours truly in other arenas).  Much like the equally idiotic Video Catnip videos, these films for cats are basically nothing more than some fidgety camera person filming birds that hopefully will keep your feline's attention while you're at work or out turning tricks.  If you're lucky, the house will be in good shape when you return.  I can't personally recommend these since my wife's newest terror cat (al-Bobo!) barely paid any attention.  Of course he has a puny brain...",1067558400,7,704,5.1946902654867255
7921871,3,B00004SSN1,"Our cat likes to watch these videos but I think they could be a little more clear.  Maybe I am spoiled by DVD's but I didn't think these videos were that clear.  But what do I know, my cat likes it and I will not argue with her....I might get bitten. =)",1056758400,6,253,3.8461538461538463
7921872,4,B00004SSN1,"My 4 year old kitty, Cleo, LOVED these videos. She was completely enthralled. She varied between sitting and watching, to crouching to attack and climbing all over the TV to get the birdies. I gave it four stars for 2 reasons. First, I don't recommend it for kittens. My four month old kitten, Boon, just was not that interested. I don't think his short attention span allowed him to sit and watch. So, I don't recommend it for kittens. Second, the quality was not that good. Some of it has that ""Blair Witch"" feel of a camera bouncing around a bit. However, Cleo did not mind.",1038182400,6,577,4.452830188679245
7921873,5,B00004SSN1,"You can't go wrong buying these videos.  Honestly, it's like Saturday cartoons for children!  My kitties sat transfixed watching all the different birds come and go.  Now when I turn the TV at night from bed, one of the kitties races to the end of the bed and stares at the TV screen to see if the birds are going to be the feature event!",1005264000,,338,4.1692307692307695
7921874,5,B00004SSN1,This video is truly the greatest. It's the most excited that I have seen my three cats since they were little rambunctious kittens. You've brought the life back in my cats life. And made it more exciting for me to watch them.  Thank you Feathers for felines.,977011200,12,258,4.48936170212766
