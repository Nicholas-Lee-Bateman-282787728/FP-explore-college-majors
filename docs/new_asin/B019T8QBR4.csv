7581992,5,B019T8QBR4,"OUTSTANDING!  I had my doubts when I saw a clip of Will using Nigerian-accented English - but this film blew us away; we loved it. I've known my share of Nigerians and Will Smith NAILED the accent -- more of a cultural ""attitude"".
 Will Smith is BLAZING in this film based on real-life Nigerian pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (please see the interview on PBS Frontline) who discovered a new disease that he named chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. This disease is caused by repeated blows to the head - brain injury - which is not apparent without digging Deep.  Of course, high drama ensues when Dr. Omalu presents his findings to the NFL and the other powers that be. Billions of dollars are involved - and where there's Money there are going to be Death Threats and Lies -- count on that -- that's just how we roll.",1451260800,4,823,4.547297297297297
7581993,5,B019T8QBR4,"The film centers on Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) a highly educated Nigerian pathologist working in the city of Pittsburgh. When Mike Webster died young, Omalu performs a full autopsy. He then orders brain slides where he discovers Webster had CTE, a condition where the brains proteins change the brain as Webster cries out, ""I'm dyeing in here!"" As more football players die young, a case is made that the frequent blows to the head cause the problem, evidence that won't go away

Omalu is an unorthodox pathologist who appears eligible for sainthood. He embellishes everything that is good, while the NFL, not so good. In the end science prevailed, although the problem still exists. It was an interesting film, even though you knew how it ends.

7581994,5,B019T8QBR4,"The acting was Oscar worthy, the science behind the discovery was fascinating, and the fact that it's based on a true story is incredible. It's proof that one person can make a difference. What is more impressive is after watching the film I discovered that this movie was a watered-down version of the original script. Even though Sony tried to avoid legal issues with the NFL by softening the script, I still found it spellbinding.

I will say that I think it's ironic Sony made a movie about a man taking a stand against the NFL yet Sony pictures, with all their vast resources, are too afraid to do the same.",1451260800,11,612,4.513513513513513
7581995,3,B019T8QBR4,"Football Hall of Famer Mike Webster dies at age 50 and a Pittsburg doctor does his autopsy. He discover that his brain is scrambled. He gets his work about blows to the head published but it is dismissed. Then other players end up dead and his observations are reconsidered.

A love story is tossed in, in an effort to make this watchable. While all the actors do fine jobs of representing their characters it lumbers along for two hours as research is exhibited and people are seen reading. (Note to self, watching someone read does not translate well to screen. Additionally character are allowed to monologue, probably 20 minutes could be cut out of this.

Numerous times a camera flies over the city of Pittsburg (ok, it looks nice) and ends up at Heinz Field to evidently represent the stadium as the villain. Occasional insight, occasional humor, some swearing. RIP to the American Gladiators. Many have said they would not have had it any other way.---

It is mentioned that if 10 percent of moms decide football is to violent, the game is done. What (if anything) will the game look like in the next 50 years?",1451174400,4,1117,4.659898477157361

7582000,5,B019T8QBR4,Great film!! Will Smith was wonderful in this role and told a great story. Dr Omalu's work and perseverance has changed the concussion protocol in football - and with good reason.

7582079,5,B019T8QBR4,"[CAUTION: SPOILERS]

Excellent movie! For a change, Truth prevails, and the good guys win.

The National Football League (NFL) is the bad guy here, for allegedly not having revealed information about serous brain damage suffered by many NFL players. Some justice is done as the NFL is forced to settle with thousands of former players and the estates of former players.

Will Smith does superb job portraying Nigerian born Truth seeker Dr. Bennet Omalu, the multi-degreed forensic pathologist who published peer-review findings on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which was ""killing"" American football players.

Dr. Omalu worked at the Allegheny County Coroner's Office in Pittsburgh and reported to Dr. Cyril Wecht (played effectively by Albert Brooks). The movie states that it is ""based on a true story"" which always makes me wonder how much is actually true.  For example, the movie refers to legal charges brought against Dr. Wecht regarding Allegheny County resources and his private pathology business. Is it true that the NFL was instrumental in getting those charges brought, and involving the FBI, as the film implies?

Not surprising that Dr. Wecht was very supportive of Dr. Omalu's courageous Truth efforts, for Dr. Wecht is well known in Truth circles for having demonstrated that the Warren Commission findings that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone assassin who murdered President John F. Kennedy are completely bogus.

In sum, a movie well worth watching!",1512259200,,1473,5.296137339055794

The same feeling I have watching old movies, with Bogart taking deep drags from his cigarette, and knowing how he died, too soon.  Him and so many others.  Learning of professional football players shooting themselves to death in the heart so their brains can be studied is tragic.  If the NFL won't change, their audience will watch something else.

When a movie is rated PG13, it shouldn't have ANY cursing in it; especially my Lord and Savior's name in vain.  With Amazon being as large a corporation as it is, why can't someone influence the movie moguls to stop using the Lord's name in vain entirely?

7582085,5,B019T8QBR4,"I'm glad the studio executives approved this film. There really should be more films like this each year, considering there are comic related films released almost annually. For example, Spider man. How many times do we need to see a new version of Spider man or Batman? Rather, create and release more educational films that create one to question and think about certain things that people fail to question. If a remake of this film is released annually, in comparison to pointless ""kid flicks,"" the NFL would go bankrupt. After seeing this, I will never support the NFL, EVER. I was once a fan of the NFL, and I'm sure there was a time when football was about pleasure, but it is a apparent to me that once it grew it popularity, and generated revenue, greed became involved. It's actually sad to see a good concept as Amazon, becoming involved with the NFL, and showing streams of NFL games. Is that really what Amazon is about now? Revenue, rather than the concept? I love the idea of merging with Whole Foods, seeing as it promotes a healthy, good, lifestyle, but how does Football?",1511308800,,1088,4.642487046632124

I knew from all the concussion studies I've read about that this movie could change my mind about watching and supporting football.  I watched it...it did!  First off, Will Smith was meant for this role.  He did a masterful job.  This is a biographical movie and if you know anything about concussions you realize this movie ran a real risk when it took on the billion dollar money machine that is the NFL in making this.  The NFL did NOT want this movie released, and for good reason:  The money they make off the bodies of the players.  At times it's really hard to watch because truth is not always pleasant.

I hope every mother of every youngster playing the game will see this film. Perhaps it will save some lives. Will Smith did an excellent job as did the rest of the cast.

I must say that Will Smith did an amazing job in this movie.  I'm more of a fan of the Independence Day type of movie...and I confess that when I heard about all the controversy regarding Will Smith not being nominated for whatever award movie actors get, I thought...be a better actor.  BUT, in this movie Will Smith was fantastic at portraying the humble doctor who discovered this link between CTE and football players.  I don't know what other movies did get the nomination for the award (because I really could not care less about those awards)...but either they were really, really fantastic movies, or Will Smith did get shafted on that one.

I love football but now feel there has to be a solution to all sports entertainment people that need protection or a solution to stop this type of injury.  Will Smith did a marvelous job of portraying Dr. Ormalu and the rest of the actors did a wonderful job and set the right stage for all that happened.

7582106,5,B019T8QBR4,"I work professionally with individuals with concussions, including carrying out post-concussion assessments. Thus, this film was on my must-see list, but it felt a little bit obligatory for that reason. I was expecting kind of a dry, medical progress sort of story, with the scientific hero establishing new insights (and, of course, being recognized, sooner or later, for doing so). While thats kind of true in the final analysis, the story is actually about power and belief, including the struggle to change a system in which the very behaviours that create devastating brain injuries are glorified, celebrated --- and commercialized. That truth has few champions is a recurring story in every field of human endeavour, not just at the junction of science, healthcare and sports. But it is easy to forget how unpopular and unwelcome truth so commonly is, and the many reasons why this is so.

On an additional note, Will Smith outdid himself in exhibiting his capacity to portray a character who is obviously not a mere variation of himself. He succeeds at placing himself imaginatively into a character who is somewhat distinctive and, more than that, not at all a North American stereotype --- that is, a successful immigrant who had established much of his success before he ever got here, and was then stymied in the United States by cultural forces whose nature, ultimately, is alien to his own background and experience.

In short, this was not a dry, scientific progress story; rather a gripping drama of struggle and hard-won victory --- and still only partially-won.",1504915200,,1578,5.065384615384615

7582109,5,B019T8QBR4,The movie was outstanding in every way. Play write was moving along with the acting. The movie differently opened my eyes to the NFL.,1504483200,,133,4.583333333333333
7582110,5,B019T8QBR4,"I remember when the trailer came out for this movie. It looks like a boring movie about sports and controversy with a grandstanding Will Smith. I had absolutely no desire to see this film. Then a good friend of mine told me that it was a really good film and I needed to see. My friend knows me and my tastes well so I decided to give it a shot. Boy oh boy was I ever wrong about this movie. This is an absolute must-see.

Yes, this movie stars Will Smith. But don't let the DVD cover fool you, it's not about Will Smith, it's about Dr. Bennet Omalu. Yes, the controversy involves football. But don't let that fool you either. This is about men going mad and dying. Will Smith just happens to be the actor who plays Dr. Bennet Omalu and Football just happens to be the sport responsible for the madness and death. This is not a ""Will Smith Movie"", nor is it a ""Football Movie"".

I remember when I was a young man and I hated Brad Pitt. I figured her was just another pretty-boy actor. Then I saw ""Seven Years in Tibet"" and it opened my eyes to what great acting is. Great acting makes the actor disappear and BECOME the character they are portraying. When you watch as many films as I do, you might come to feel as if you are watching ""Tom Cruise"" or ""Mark Wahlberg"" instead of the characters they play, and this phenomenon is amplified by popular celebrities often ""playing themselves"" in a film. I'm here to tell you though, this is not ""Independence Day"" or the equivalent ""Ocean's 11"". This is the equivalent of ""Seven Years in Tibet"".

If you are curious as the genre of this film, it reminds me of ""simulation films"" such as ""Contagion"" and ""Unstoppable"". While this film is filled to the brim with brilliant Oscar-worthy acting all-around, and Will Smith certainly gives the performance of a lifetime, there is quite obviously a deep, DEEP respect for the subject matter of the film, and it is played by all with layered complexity, subtlety, balance, and above-all respect.

At it's heart, this is a realistic drama that tells the story of one man's struggle to bring an ugly truth to life and save lives. The script is superb to point of being quotable. The seriousness is balanced out with human emotions surrounding love, fear, discrimination, desperation, and idealism. There are moments of quiet longing, moments of visceral fear, and moment of laugh-out-loud hilarity. The cinematography is far better in this film than I expected, not at all the boring camera shots I was expecting. I had to turn down the bass on my stereo because the music literally shakes the walls on in my living room. The score is beautiful and immersive and again, better than I expected. All of these elements, the acting, the dialog, the music, the cinematography, work together to make an outstanding film.

Football players are stereotyped as brutes in our world. Immigrants are stereotyped as ignorant, incompetent, untrustworthy, or even downright criminal in our world. It is refreshing, eye-opening, chilling, and inspiring to see a film where you see the violent football players terrified of their own behavior as their emotions swing from crying to physically attacking their friends and family. To see a film where a highly educated, gracious, noble African man saves American lives and is deeply respectful of people in general. To see a film that portrays both sides of everyone's story.

See this movie. You'll probably want to buy it. I know I will be doing so.",1504396800,,3466,4.673770491803278

Common sense tells us that repeated banging a skull with the ferocity that is in football will have deleterious effects.  Don't believe me?

7582126,5,B019T8QBR4,"I do not know football and do not enjoy watching it like my spouse and kids do. So, it is interesting how i can relate to the manner Dr Bennet tried to understand the game in doing his job and cracking the mystery. I am a sportswoman and I participate in high risk sports all my life but maybe because like Bennet in the movie, being not born in America, I do not feel the same level of passion for this very popular sport here. On the other hand, like him, I do see the intensity and beauty of such an intricate sport, particularly the strategies, skill and intelligence necessary for victory.

I always think American football is a too violent a sport but no one ever pays much attention to my observation when we watch or talk about the games. I wonder but doubt if a football fan would ever know how a non-football-lover perceive the sport so very differently from them, like through the eyes of Bennet in the story.  I am so glad this movie gives a louder voice to my doubts and reservations and even critiques to the forceful impacts and repercussions leading to severe permanent injuries like the once unfounded ones as this movie (or Dr Bennet's research) has revealed. Yes, i am that 10% of moms who will never let my sons play American football.",1499212800,,1255,4.428571428571429

7582145,5,B019T8QBR4,"I loved playing football growing up as a kid all the way through high school, and my favorite thing to do was bust someone as hard as I could head to head with my helmet. I was proud of all the different color collision marks I had on my helmet from each team we played. My first time getting knocked unconscious from a helmet collision was the city champ game in the 4th grade; that's right I was only 9-10 years old!

When my son turned seven, I enthusiastically signed him up for pee-wee. He loved the game just like me. His first year, a team mate broke his leg during practice. The next year, my son got hit blind-side and was knocked unconscious for several seconds. I was already concerned for his safety but tried not to worry too much because I know how much fun it is to play football and I know how much he loves the game. However, we skipped his 3rd and 4th season because it was just plain and simple - American football is a big risk and I wasn't willing to allow my son to take these risk. He's a great kid so he didn't complain too much but he would let me know how much he missed playing and didn't understand the risk until we watch this movie together. The only good thing about my son being knocked unconscious is that he could completely relate to the movie and it's message. After the movie he said he now understands why I won't let him play.

Alternatively, we've be training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu together for about 3 months under Ryron and Renen Gracie. We've found a new passion in Jiu Jitsu. It's something we can do as a family at home and at the Gym on the mats!

7582159,5,B019T8QBR4,"Last year, I watched the 2013 PBS Frontline episode League of Denial: The NFLs Concussion Crisis, and read the Fainaru brothers non-fiction book of the same name. I recently decided to watch the movie Concussion, which is a brilliant biographical drama about Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who originally discovered the degenerative brain disease now linked to many former NFL players: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Concussion tells the story of how Omalu, a brilliant Nigerian-born forensic pathologist and neuropathologist, discovered what he later named as CTE while performing an autopsy on Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Webster, the retired Pittsburgh Steelers center who died in 2002 at age 50.

Peter Landesmans screenplay shows the tension that developed between Dr. Omalu and the National Football League (NFL)  after Omalu published his CTE findings. The optimistic and idealistic Omalu honestly thought the NFLs senior leadership would thank him for bringing this terrible disease to their attention. Instead, two successive NFL Commissioners and batteries of league-appointed doctors and lawyers steadfastly denied any linkage between CTE the deaths of football players. They attacked not only Omalus findings, but also Omalu himself, calling him a quack, questioning his professional competence, and even threatening him and his family.

My overall reaction to Concussion is very positive. Written and directed by Peter Landesman, Concussion includes among its stars Will Smith, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Alec Baldwin, David Morse, Albert Brooks, and Arliss Howard.  I share the view of many that Concussion, although not without its flaws and controversies, is certainly a brilliantly acted, written, and directed film.

Will Smith delivers an especially praiseworthy performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu, as does Gugu Mbatha-Raw as his gentle, loving wife Prema Mutiso. Other performances of note include Baldwins portrayal of Dr. Julian Bailes and Albert Brooks depiction of Allegheny County Medical Examiner Dr. Cyril Wecht.

I like Concussion so much that I recently added it to my Amazon Video digital streaming library. Highly recommended.",1490313600,3,2170,5.679012345679013

Highly recommended. Very compelling.",1490140800,,319,4.5
7582161,5,B019T8QBR4,"Exceptional movie, exceptional actor (Will Smith).

This was one of the only movies I've seen in a while where the featurettes weren't wack and inane. It was actually a joy to ""meet"" the actual brilliant Dr. Bennet Omalu.

Will doesn't speak like him in the movie -- he's more understandable, necessarily -- and he doesn't seem to move/gesture like him. (Dr. Omalu seems a lot more animated and emphatic.) Not super important to me, but I found it interesting.

Also interesting was to learn what Dr. Omalu's name means! <3",1489449600,,523,4.788888888888889

7582163,5,B019T8QBR4,"Concussion, 2015 film

In September 2002 there is a trial. A physician in emergency medicine testifies. He specializes in neuro-pathology and has a list of accomplishments. He testifies about a defendant who has hemophilia and could not have been an attacker. Back at the hospital he treats patients - as a medical examiner. Dr. Cyril Wecht is in charge, he has another case for Dr. Omalu. At church he is told about a young woman from Kenya who needs shelter. A man is taken to the hospital (he used to be famous). Mike wants help. His death creates news. Dr. Bennet Omalu works on the corpse. The CT scan is six months old. The medical record has the complaints. There is a problem over costs. The brain if fixed and sectioned. He finds something! Later he watches a football game. Players are told to be violent. [Like the gladiators of Rome?] He watches football players in person. An expert looks at the specimens. The human brain isn't protected against shocks like some birds.

Hits affected Mikes brain, like other players in football. Can this condition be given a name? This discovery will be published in a medical journal. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy or CTE is the name for this disease. Elsewhere another ex-football player suffers from a medical condition; he dies in a crash. The published report causes concerns in New York City and an attack on Dr. Omalu! The NFL is a big and powerful corporation that acts to defend its business. Dr. Omalu said Terry had the same condition. There will be more cases. Dr. Omalu gets a telephone threat; also more background news about deaths. This condition does not show up on a CT scan, only after death. An ex-football player complains about his problem, but it not helped. His suicide is in the news. A team doctor does anything to keep them in the game; its business. Football is the most popular sport in America. [Their shows attract a lot of advertising dollars.] Dead men ruin their families.

As a young boy Dr. Omalu admired America. Omalus report is printed in a New York City newspaper. The NFL is an entertainment product. There is a meeting in Chicago over this question. But Dr. Omalu was dis-invited. This meeting was rigged to deny CTE: multiple injuries have no consequences. The FBI arrests Cyril Wecht MD JD over the use of expense accounts! Dr. Omalu is also threatened! Omalus wife is followed by a car, and suffers a miscarriage. They plan changes and move to California. There is the death of another ex-football player by suicide; his brain is donated to research.

Dr. Omalu speaks to an audience about TCE and its dangers. It is compared to smoking tobacco. The Chief Medical Examiner for Washington DC is an important official position. Will he take the job? No, he returned to California and his wife Prema and their two sons. In 2011 retired NFL players sued the League for concealing the dangers of concussion. It was settled on the condition they would keep secret what they knew. About 28% of football players will suffer from cognitive impairment. All the federal charges against Dr. Cyril Wecht were dismissed.

This is a very important and educational story. I never heard of this condition before, did you? The dangers of tobacco smoking were known before the connection to lung cancer, but only the effect of nicotine on the heart. Should children and teenagers be encouraged to engage in football? Heading the ball in soccer also has dangers. Is this condition found in other sports? But do they attract viewers and advertising dollars like football? Basketball doesnt need helmets.",1489363200,,3579,4.813008130081301

7582208,5,B019T8QBR4,"Of his 27 movies (counting 2017's Bright), this is, by far, Will Smith's most important one in terms of social responsibility and shedding light on a serious problem. The concussion and sub-concussion problems at any level of football are something we've all known about instinctively for decades, despite the fact that we've chosen to ignore them for a variety of reasons. No one should finish playing any game (football or otherwise) and have to spend the remainder of the weekend in a darkened room taking aspirin and putting cold compresses on his head. This, along with the periodic blurring of vision, forgetfulness, neck and spine pain, tingling in the fingers, etc., is a clear indication one is doing something wrong to one's body. Unfortunately, manhood is often defined by participation in this dangerous sport and so it continues unabated in most parts of the country.

I played from little league up through my third year of college, and now in my late 40s when my motivations for doing so are essentially meaningless, I wish I never had. I wake up everyday with pain that cannot be fixed so I hope many, many youngsters will see this movie and decide it isn't worth it...before it's too late. All I can say is at least my damage and pain, so far, are not brain-related...we'll see.

This film also highlights the incredibly unscrupulous behavior and out of control greed of the NFL. The discovery of the cumulative brain trauma and this film threaten their business so they have done everything in their power to obscure and minimize the problem. They will tell you now that they have recognized the problem and have taken appropriate measures to mitigate the damage by instituting their concussion protocols. I will tell you there is little to nothing that can be done to protect the brain from the damage that football inflicts. Because of the influence of NFL as a big business and the devotion of its vast fan base, there was no way Will was going to get an Oscar for this film. I think he and the creator of this film deserve at least consideration for a Nobel Prize in either Physiology/Medicine or Literature, but really I just wish I could thank them personally for their contributions.

If you have children and are considering allowing them to play this game, or you are a child, yourself, who is being pressured to play, please watch this and watch the PBS documentary, NFL: League of Denial. Open your eyes to all of the facts before you make your final decision. Regardless of the likely unpopularity of my review here, I feel compelled to post this because I know what I'm talking about from experience.",1485734400,,2631,4.765350877192983

7582239,5,B019T8QBR4,"CONCUSSION is a color film taking place in the present era, starring Will Smith, Alec Baldwin, and Gugulethu Mbatha.  The timing clocks in at 122 minutes, but that is fine, because the acting and storyline are so great that I could have watched it even if it lasted for three hours.

ELEMENTS OF STORYLINE.  At least in my mind, what was most striking in this movie is Will Smith's transformation into his character.  Will Smith mimics the West African accent very well, and he adds random squeaks to his voice, apparently in order to more accurately represent his character.  Whatever the reason, viewers will have little that the actor is Mr. Will Smith, as a result of the actor's transformation into his character.  The film is a biography of Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian who graduated from med school in Nigeria, and who relocated to the United States, and became a neuropathologist.  In real life, Dr. Omalu discovered and published his findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in American football players while working at the Allegheny County Coroner's Office in Pittsburgh.  Rather than provide any further details of the plot, it is sufficient to make the following remarks.

STORYLINE OF HOW SELF-AWARENESS OF THE GOAL WAS NEBULOUS AT FIRST, BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS, BECAME MORE DISTINCT.  Another important lesson from this movie, is that Will Smith's goal was not to transform how football is played, for example, not to implement more safeguards to prevent physical injury, and that instead Will Smith's goal was to ensure that football players would be made aware from the get-go that playing their sport entails the risk of brain damage, depression, and suicide.  This movie does an admirable job at relaying the message that the characters were not aware that this was their goal, but as reality unfolded during the course of the movie (and apparently, as reality unfolded in the corresponding real life events), self-awareness of this goal eventually came to be.

MOVIE ROLES ABOUT UNDERDOGS WHO PREVAIL AGAINST ALL ODDS.  I have come to admire Mr. Will Smith as more than an actor destined for movies that are silly and fluffy, such as Men In Black and Hancock.  In view of his roles in HAPPYNESS and CONCUSSION, I have become a convert and true believer in Mr. Will Smith.  Both of these films, Happyness and Concussion, are about an underdog who, against all odds, prevails.  Viewers of the movie will cherish the great skill in acting and scriptwriting, in scenes where people in power are arrogant towards Mr. Smith's character and treat him like a street-sweeper or janitor.  Another great scene, is where

LESSON IN HOW TO PLAY POLITICS, AND MAKE IT WORK TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE.  Mr. Smith's character becomes too wrapped up in his crusade, and demands to give a speech in front of a medical convention.  In this remarkable and intelligent scene, Alec Baldwin gives Mr. Smith a short lesson in how to be more attuned to reality, to be more flexible, and that playing a bit of politics can work to your own advantage.  The point made by Alec Baldwin in this intelligent scene, is that if Alec Baldwin gave the medical convention speech, then the audience would listen to Mr. Smith's message about concussions while, in contrast, if Will Smith gave the medical convention speech, his message would not be well-received and his crusade would fail.

7582257,2,B019T8QBR4,"I was hesitant to pay $10 for a Will Smith movie but wanted to see it after watching some old ESPN Monday Night Countdown ""Jacked Up"" videos. The movie is definitely just a one-time view which is why I wish there was a rental option here. I am a football fan and was familiar with the subject matter and the individuals covered in the movie (from Mike Webster to Dave Duerson; who along with being a Bear, was a member of the Super Bowl Champion New York Football Giants in 1990). I have no love whatsoever for Roger Goodell so I was happy to see him deservedly cast in a bad light. However, there are unnecessary political undertones in this movie which is probably no surprise for Hollywood, Will Smith, Wecht and upon some investigation, the real Omalu.

7582304,5,B019T8QBR4,"I cannot say how pleased I was to see this made into a film. The acting was stellar, the script believable.  Thank you to the director for choosing this. It was brave and important for people to understand the impact of concussions. Many times people have concussions and they don't realize it, so they go undocumented. As a person with over 15 documented concussions  ( there are most likely many more do to my profession and times I didn't seem medical treatment), i unfortunately understand some of the torment described. I cannot imagine 70,000 concussions...  as it is, I have chronic migraine, dizziness, I fall all of the time and get new injuries because of it, loose my vision at times, have executive functioning and cognitive issues, I can get an actual concussion now and not hit my head! How is that possible? If I fall and the concussion goes through my body to my brain it causes a concussion. I had no idea that was possible until it started happening(and diagnosed by neurologist specializing in tbi). After this my head hurt so bad I literally vomited for 3 months. This all can easily lead to depression and irritability.  So next time you ride a bike, horse, motorcycle wear a helmet ( I always say I have yet to hear a good reason to not wear a helmet, because there isn't one). Be aware when doing sports or ANY activity, how many times your head gets hit. You don't want to end up like me, or the unfortunate people in this movie.  You don't want to experience how much it sucks.
I again applaud the makers of this film on so many accounts. Thank you. This raises awareness for the risk football players have, but the risk all of us face from multiple traumas to brain. Even if they seem small. CTE scares me, and I am afraid an autopsy after my death ( eventually) would show this. I wish there was a way to diagnose while living. Maybe this awareness can help fund research to diagnose while alive?",1482019200,,1923,4.498567335243553

It is really great Will Smith put this together and he did a marvelous job.  I believe it has opened up peoples awareness of the long term effects of concussions.  We are Christians and I asked for prayers of protection during the 10 years my husband played  and I believe the Lord really answered them in a lot of ways.  Now I am watching many of the things start to emerge, but we are making it through with prayer and the Lord.

7582350,5,B019T8QBR4,"Will Smith is, as usual, amazing in this movie. I put off watching it because I assumed it was all about football. And it was in some ways but mostly it was just an amazing true story of an immigrant genius that discovered CTE from repeated concussions. When threatened by the NFL over his findings, he didn't back down and did what was right. I currently have a similar problem - brain injury that is made worse because of repeated concussions. It was very enlightening, inspiring, and (for me) a little sad. Great movie and raises awareness. Will definitely watch this again.",1480636800,,577,4.666666666666667

Watching the portrayal by the actors, especially Mike Webster, helped me finally understand what happened in my life. I have never witnessed someone else experiencing the demons that have plagued me since early adulthood. It was unbelievably on point, to say the least. Dr. Omalu, I want to meet you just to thank you for your persistence and brilliance. Thank God for you and my being able to understand and actually enjoy life.

7582484,5,B019T8QBR4,"Just in time for the NFL playoffs, here comes Concussion, a movie that will hopefully give many serious pause about our nations most popular sport.

Based on a true story, Will Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian-born, hyper-motivated coroner working in Pittsburgh. He treats the dead bodies he examines as his patients, carefully trying to determine the cause of their deaths.

One day hes assigned the body of a local legend, a former Pittsburgh Steeler and NFL hall-of-famer named Mike Webster (David Morse), a man who went from the pinnacles of success to living in a broken-down truck. Omalu notices something inconsistent with Websters brain and, against the protests of a fellow coroner and Steeler fan (Mike OMalley), decides to run some sophisticated tests, paying for them with his own money.

With the backing of his no-nonsense boss (Albert Brooks), Omalu determines that Webster suffered a litany of concussions over his career, which eventually led to his erratic, irrational behavior. Some animals skulls come equipped with insulation to protect against hard hits; human skulls have no such insulation. Omalu comes to discover that a great many football players have had similar problems, and other inexplicable deaths have occurred",1475020800,,1252,5.28140703517588

7582490,4,B019T8QBR4,This was a good movie. The prevalence of devastating brain injury due to frequent concussions in the NFL (and other sports) is a serious issue that deserves attention. It's a gripping story--it's amazing what Dr. Omalu went through trying to bring attention to the problem of concussions in football. Will Smith is good in the role however the sub-plot about developing a relationship with the woman he married was a bit sentimental and wasn't critical to the movie and I wished they had focused more on the main plot.,1474934400,,518,4.831460674157303

7582503,5,B019T8QBR4,"This is an amazing movie based on a true story.  Will Smith gives a nuanced, believable performance as the doctor who becomes the righteous advocate for Pitsburgh Steelers great Mike Webster post death, as the doctor is forced to take on the NFL to prove CTE was the cause of Webster's life and mental deterioration and that all of the blows to the head Webster withstood during his 18 years as a member of the Steelers was the contributing factor to Webster's death.  The heinous things NFL big wigs do to destroy the credibility of the doctor in their zeal to cover up their culpability in the proliferation of CTE injuries among NFL players outrages you as you view the movie and causes you to admire the doctor's bravery in his battle to be the voice for Mike Webster as well as save his own credibility and career.

Aside from david morse and luke wilson, i fully disliked all of them prior to this film. Now i can only partially dislike them. Credit to all involved. I was hanging on every word from every character. Fully invested in each individual. I imagine it was easy for the ensemble to do when lead by smith at his best. Not only has he nailed the accent but his portrayal of bennet is the deepest hes done in years. A powerful true story depicted in a powerful, amazing effort.",1473638400,,734,4.364963503649635

7582556,5,B019T8QBR4,"Distressing and affirming.  Deeply troubling.  We would not allow non-human animals to be treated similarly for entertainment.  And, yet, Pop Warner football continues.  Which means middle school, high school, college, and NFL football continue.  I contrast this with stories about how much money collegiate football earns the schools involved, while the players are unpaid and, sometimes, resorting to minor crimes in order to get enough to eat.  This represents a business model as craven as that of Wal-Mart.

The issue of CTE, and related injuries, is relevant for more football, too.  There are plenty of people suffering all manner of post-concussion and post-whiplash syndromes, most of whom are never properly diagnosed.

The acting and directing were excellent, especially given the truth is known so early on, yet the characters continue to take us along on their personal journeys.  Only Prema's character falterednot due to the actress, who was quite good, but due to the stultifying dialogue and clear treatment of her as a mechanism, rather than a person.",1473379200,,1069,5.309523809523809

The movie makes a statement and has an important social impact on the lives of all sports figures who play rough contact sports.  I'd recommend this movie for all parents who are considering sons and daughters playing contact sports from little league, soccer or Pop Warner etc. Not to discourage them but more to teach the parent what they need to know... and give them information on how to make sure their young man or lady is playing a sport that changes have been made  to keep every player from having permanent damage. I was aware of the issue that literally changed the world of contact sports, now knowing the story behind the struggle the main character was willing to go through to stand up against one of the biggest sports and marketing machines in the U.S; and how he accomplished it was well worth watching.",1473033600,,919,4.597560975609756

7582653,4,B019T8QBR4,An inspirational true story of a Nigerian pathologist with 8 university degrees who goes head to head against the might of the American NFL. One of Will Smith's finest performances and truly the heart of this film.,1470960000,,214,4.8108108108108105
7582654,3,B019T8QBR4,"I hate to say it but I found the widely successful film Concussion boring.  Will Smith's character is easily the best thing about the movie and in fact the only thing I liked.  He does a pretty good job in a serious role imitating a Nigerian accent and portraying a doctor (or more specifically a forensic pathologist).  Some think he's off the mark with his Nigerian accent, but I think he did a great job.

Will's doctor character finds brain deterioration after years of football players taking one brutal hit after another directly to the head (that he calls chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and makes the controversial determination that the brain damage is linked to Alzheimer's disease after studying an autopsy on a former NFL player.  Other doctors strongly disagree with Will's findings and there's even moments when they get angry at Will's character, but Will stands his ground and continues forward with his research anyway.  Very brave might I add.  I like the example Will provides by placing a brain in a glass- he constantly smacks it to show what it's like for a human brain to take many hits in a row while playing football.

From a storyline point of view this movie is very dull.  I didn't even realize David Morse was the one portraying the oversized football player with brain damage who later dies and ends up in the autopsy room for Will to work on.  He did a remarkable job changing his looks to the point I didn't even recognize the guy!  Another character whose named I can't find through a google search is also an ex-football player who experiences the same brain disorder.  In his case he turns violent towards his family and grabs his wife by the neck while the kids run around screaming before backing off realizing he's not thinking normally.  Easily the most interesting moment in the movie.

I find it amazing Roger Goodell wouldn't take Bennet Omalu seriously (the real doctor that Will is portraying) when confronted with the results the doctor finds concerning the link to excessive blows to the head and Alzheimer's disease.  Talk about denial.  For the conclusion to be that the concussion was the result of previous unrelated injuries is just... wow.  A big confusing wow!

Otherwise Concussion is a *very* slow-moving, quiet, un-dramatic attempt at showing the world the after effects of excessive trauma to the brain for football players.  The pace is so slow that it's easy to get bored.  Will Smith spends his time defending his actions in either the hospital or court room, and whenever he feels down and appears to be on the verge of helplessly giving up since nobody's believing his findings, his girlfriend (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) provides encouragement.  But this kind of drama and the talking segments throughout the movie are always overlong and makes up 85% of the movie.

No I wasn't expecting Concussion to show football players bashing into each other and giving each other concussions as the main storyline, but I was expecting more in the way of excitement for Will as he's forced to stand by his findings even with his back against the wall, and prove to the world that even though he doesn't play football or understand football, that his prognosis concerning concussions for football players is in fact legitimate  The move just isn't interesting enough.  At least Alec Baldwin plays a nice role as a doctor without being smug, and Albert Brooks also playing a doctor is an interesting change as well (since I'm used to seeing him in comedy roles).

Overall, I can't recommend it.  I really didn't feel that I learned a whole lot about concussions and football injuries after watching this.  I was pretty much aware of everything that was mentioned.  Perhaps those who don't follow football would learn a lot more than I did.  So the only thing Concussion has going for it is Will Smith's character which *is* a great acting performance.",1470960000,,3894,4.831070889894419

guns, wife beating, child abuse, animal abuse and every other sick, evil disturbing act started to surface ..... all involving the players in the NFL.

It solidifies what I've suspected for too long (although, at a much less significant impact than I realized) about sports of the sort that cause such the severe degree of injury to players. Perhaps some will wake up from the dream of the shiny dollar sign to realize the things that are more precious in this life. Things like health. Physical and mental.

7582775,2,B019T8QBR4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

On the surface, Concussion has a promising premise: Dr. Bennett Omalu, an eccentric Nigerian forensic pathologist, takes on the orthodox medical establishment and the NFL after discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head, experienced daily by professional football players. But as the Times critic, Mahnola Dargis, adroitly points out, Concussion is basically done in by a lack of a central antagonist.

In fact, what director/writer Peter Landesmann ends up doing is creating a series of antagonists (some real, some completely fictional) who collectively attempt to take Omalu down. Omalu is depicted as outside of the mainstream, talking to cadavers as he works on them and defending his practice of disposing of new surgical instruments (despite orders from his boss, chief coroner Cyril Wecht, not to do that). One of Omalu's co-workers takes exception to his unorthodox style of working and is constantly threatening him. It's a good way of suggesting that the eccentrics of society often are the subject of bullyingthe only problem is that the co-worker is a completely fictional character, and Omalu was never subject to that level of persecution.

Much more egregious in regards to overstepping dramatic license, is the implication that the FBI, prodded by the NFL, went after Omalu's boss, Dr. Wecht, as a warning to Omalu. While it was true at one point Dr. Wecht was arrested for corruption (the charges were later dropped), this occurred before Omalu published his findings about CTE. The arrest had nothing to do with Omalu's beef with the NFL, but Landesmann is intent on making us believe that Omalu was perennially threatened.

The theme of victimization is emphasized further in Landesmann's suggestion that Omalu's wife Prema suffered a miscarriage after being followed by a mysterious car while driving home. Again, this is a complete fabrication, undoubtedly designed to suggest that Omalu's opponents were far worse than they actually were.

More troubling is the widely accepted view that Dr. Omalu's findings are actually true. He based his conclusions on a small group of football players who apparently suffered brain trauma during their football careers. But Daniel Enber, writing in Slate Magazine, cites a 2012 study that ""several thousand NFL retirees, conducted by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, found that the former football players lived significantly longer than race- and age-matched controls.""

Enber went further by arguing that ""CTE is indeed a widespread epidemic among former contact-athletes butits clinical effects are pretty modest, since most men who have it are not depressed or otherwise impaired.""

In the sport of boxing, it's been said Muhammed Ali actually suffered from brain trauma and not Parkinson's Disease, due to repeated blows to the head. But George Foreman, who fought during roughly the same time period, appears healthy to this daydespite also sustaining the same kind of trauma to which Ali was subjected to.

It's also difficult to conclude that, for those football players who exhibit symptoms related to years of concussion, CTE is the only cause of their symptoms. Indeed, Dr. Omalu's first patient, the former star football player, Mike Webster, had a history of both steroid use as well as mental illness in his family. Webster was also hooked on painkillers due to chronic back pain. Was his suicide primarily due to CTE and not those other factors? Quite possibly, but one cannot say for sure.

Dr. Omalu did indeed suffer from being ostracized, particularly by his peers. Perhaps one of the strongest scenes in the film is when one of the NFL's hand-picked physicians attempts to berate Omalu and defend the NFL's policies. This is where Will Smith does a fine job of depicting Omalu's righteous indignation against an orthodox medical establishment.

In the end, Concussion lacks suspense and tension. Omalu is depicted for the most part as a saint, supported by Prema, who is nothing more than a glorified cheerleader. Ironically, it was the players themselves who finally realized they could band together and take on their NFL bosses by instituting a lawsuit. It seems now that the NFL has become much more ""sensitive"" to the issue of traumatic brain injury as a result of CTE. It's also probably true this was as much about money the players having probably made out more than ""okay"" after their lawsuit was settled in a court of law.",1469318400,,4595,5.187584345479082

7582828,5,B019T8QBR4,"Will Smith does a bravura turn as Nigerian doctor Omalu, the pathologist who discovered the brain injury suffered by many NFL players. Of course, the league denies the problem. This is the story of an outsider's search for truth, and the price he paid for insisting on it. Smith does a brilliant job of acting, inclauding a strong Nigerian accent, the actor submerges his own personality into that of Dr Omalu. Performances like this one are what acting is for.

7582840,5,B019T8QBR4,"It is always challenging to capture the essence of a story based on real events, especially one that is as complex as the story behind Concussion. Peter Landesman's film met the challenge well, but what pushed this film to 5 stars for me was Will Smith. This is the best performance I have seen from Mr. Smith - subtle, compassionate, sensitive, with a very fine edge of navet, Smith becomes Dr. Bennett Omalu in body and soul. His supporting cast is also very impressive, particularly Gugu Mbatha-Raw. This is not an easy story by any means but one of tremendous significance. Landesman gives us the many shades of gray that controversy comes coated in, but his focus on Omalu's development and integrity gives the film a gracious perspective. The entertainment aspect is brought in by the relationship between Omalu and Mutiso, as well as the relationship between Omalu and his mentor, Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks). The tragedy of the story is complicated by the love of the game, and Landesman doesn't shy away from that balancing act.",1468886400,,1041,4.853932584269663

7582852,5,B019T8QBR4,"Peter Landesman wrote (with Jeanne Marie Laskas) and directed this very important film about withholding public awareness of a devastating associated after effect of the game of football. It is surprising that it did not earn academy awards  especially for star Will Smith. But that fact may be tied to the desire to remain uninformed about adverse effects of the countrys national sport  and all the money and crowds and media coverage that accompany the sport.

CONCUSSION is a dramatic near documentary based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known. Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world  Americas form of Roman gladiators, Football. The supporting cast is excellent - Alec Baldwin as the ex-Pittsburg Steelers team physician turned compatriot Dr. Julian Bailes, Albert Brooks as Dr Cyril Wecht who supports Dr Omalus research, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Dr Omalus devoted wife, David Morse as Mike Webster whose autopsy at his death provides the initial brain material for Dr Omalus discovery of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, in addition to major players Eddie Marsan, Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje, Paul Reiser and Luke Wilson.

The film is extraordinarily well done, factual without being sensational, and places before the public a very serious problem intimately connected to the countrys national sport. The NFL will not be happy but the audience will. Grady Harp, July 16",1468713600,2,1664,5.287878787878788

I don't understand why Wil Smith didn't win an oscar for his role as the doctor.  It exposed the NFL's attitude toward all injuries, almost as if the players are expendable gladiators, in the quest for profit.  It triggered a memory I have about the Bears' Dick Butkus and the way  the Bears' team doctor treated his knees to keep him in the games, pretty much crippling him for life.

His looks and voice were so different, as were several other, older actors such as Paul Reiser, David Morse, Alec Baldwin and others.  This is a movie based on actual events, not a documentary, and even though you already know how the story ends it's well worth the watch.  Other than a few scenes where the F word is used it's suitable for the younger audience but they probably won't be interested as there are no shootouts or car chases.  There is, however, some romance.  The acting by everybody involved is superb and it's a good story about football not usually seen by the public.",1467936000,,653,4.547008547008547

Being from Pittsburgh it was refreshing to see how badly these players were treated and not too long ago.

Although many that love the sport may say that the injuries or facts may have been over exaggerated, it does show that these football players that were disrespected because of their outrageous behavior was actually a symptom of their dilapidated health due to their playing football for all these years.

My husband also played college football and had multiple concussions.  This movie is just plain scary!  It is just crazy to think what the NFL is doing to cover it up too, concussions should never be taken lightly.

Anyways, about the movie - Will Smith just nailed it.  He is a brilliant actor.. one of the best I have ever seen.  This movie was so well done and very crazy to learn about how serious some of this stuff really is.  I had no idea about all the NFL players with that condition, that ending up comitting suicide.  This movie, besides being wildly entertaining, was very educational to learn about how real concussions are, and how they need to be taken extremely seriously. Wow 5 Stars, definitely recommend this movie to all people and all ages.",1466467200,,911,4.54601226993865

While it was a little strange, or ""off"", listening to Smith talk with an accent, it did not take away from the quality of this movie. And as it is my understanding, some of the facts are a little off. It is really not the facts that are wrong, it is just some of the timeline of events that were not 100% correct. The movie will pull you in almost right away. It is so sad to see how the NFL was putting profit before safety and lives. More worried about protecting the image of the sport then the safety of the players. Before you rent this movie have your popcorn ready, you won't want to pause it, it really pulls you in emotionally.",1465776000,2,729,4.140845070422535

7583138,5,B019T8QBR4,"The film based on real events -
Nigerian Immigrant 'Dr Bennett Omalu' (Will Smith) works as a pathologist in 'Pittsburgh' who is frequently at odds with a colleague because of his
insistence to be thorough despite exceeding the budget
His life is turned upside down when 'Mike Webster' a 50 year-old Football-Legend dies and becomes the subject of his investigation, initially finding
no cause he digs deeper looking for an explanation.
Invisible to scans the former N.F.L  'Dr Omalu' realizes the death to be linked to trauma caused by the continuous  collisions inflicted during the course
of the games he'd played.
His conclusions accepted by leading neurologists gives rise to a publication, the condition is given the name 'Chronic Trauma Encephalopathy'
Obviously pleased by the recognition however is short-lived he now finds himself to be up against the N.F.L the Establishment and indeed the General
- Public (Football-Fans) who reject his findings.
He gets the support of 'Dr Julian Bailes' (Alec Baldwin) who had down the years had association with the Football Authorities and agree's that collision
trauma had and still caused ongoing issues.
Despite all the evidence the N.F.L challenge the findings demanding that 'Dr Omalu' withdraw his submissions....fearing the impact could damage America's
most revered game.
The Establishment set out to discredit 'Dr Omalu' and 'Dr Bailes' along with bringing proceedings against 'Dr Cyril Wecht' (Albert Brooks) 'Bennett's' manager
who they clearly feel should have suppressed his employee's investigation.....
'Bennett' and his wife 'Prema' (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) forced by pressure put on the to move away.....
How many more 'Football' deaths would it take for the N.F.L to accept 'Dr Omalu's' conclusions ??
This a well made, well portrayed and intensely absorbing drama in which 'Will Smith' tuns in what is probably his best performance for many a year....

7583160,5,B019T8QBR4,"Another great American cover up, I think the last lines of the film sums up the premise:

""In 2011, retired NFL players began suing the league for concealing the dangers of concussions.  Over 5,000 ultimately brought suit""

""The NFL settled on the condition that it would not have to disclose what it knew, and when, about the effects of concussions on football players.""

Of course based on the best selling book, the movie Concussion places the NFL as the ""corporation"" in this thriller and as we see whistleblower Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), an outsider from the NFL, put together the pieces of what amounts to a conspiracy.  The film is very gripping and likens back to another great whistleblower movie about the tobacco industry from the 90's,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Insider/dp/B00003CWRX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Insider</a>.

Unfortunately, there are just a few too many untruths in a movie that is supposedly all about telling the truth. The FBI did raid Cyril Wecht's office... Months BEFORE any of Omula's research was ever published. Omula did testify against Wecht and even made a bid for his job. He moved to California, but not because of harassment.
The truth is beautiful, poignant, powerful, and touching. Omila's brilliant heroism needs no embellishing. The NFL corruption is evident without spinning lies. The tragedy of champions is made no more agonizing by ornate falsities. Tell the truth!",1464998400,8,791,4.823529411764706

7583190,4,B019T8QBR4,"No question about it. Concussion could have been a better film. Will Smith was obviously disappointed that he never was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal as Dr. Bennett Omalu. While I may say that he did a wonderful performance as the leading character,too bad that the film decided to make safe approaches which unfortunately weakened the film.

The film directed by Peter Landesman was set back in 2002. At this time,a Nigerian forensic pathologist in Dr. Omalu discovered a brain injury known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which occurs to National Football League players after he did an autopsy on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster,who was found dead in his pickup truck. After releasing a report on the said findings on the degeneration of the brain that is highly possible for football players,he fights a battle against the league to suppress his research on it.

Too bad that instead of focusing on the topic CTE or the football players who are prone to the said disease,it took safe approaches by dealing more on the life of Dr. Omalu. Unfortunately,viewers are more interested in both the brain injury as well as the most popular sport in the United States. Dealing more on the doctor makes it less interesting. It could have been a better film had it not done that. Also,it would also be more revealing on how the sport could be indeed very dangerous to the brain and one's mental health just like when cigarettes were first discovered as dangerous to one's health decades ago.",1464912000,,1528,4.895752895752896

7583239,3,B019T8QBR4,"ok movie.  50% true story, and 50% over-drama... for me anyway.  way too much story on Dr Omalu's marriage and not nearly sufficient focus/truth on his relationship with his real fight on the institution.

i would have preferred a story focused more on the institutional power fight than the romance of will smith and his characterized wife.

the story of Iron Mike and Justin Strzelczyk are true tradegies of our time.  the message of truth on how the great Mike Webster's and Strzelczk's minds were destroyed by concussions is a huge coverup.  hopefully more stories like this may be told...",1464480000,,593,4.88

7583255,5,B019T8QBR4,"This movie has absolutely changed my life and in a way that I was simply not expecting. Like so many young boys in America I was raised by a father who loved football almost more than anything else in his life. From an early age I spent most of my weekends in Fall/Winter watching the game and watching the admiration of my father as he tried to live vicariously through the players on the screen. I knew from the age of 7 that I needed to be a football player so I could make my dad proud, and be one of those people that he was watching on the TV.

I played from the age of 10 all the way through college. I sacrificed so much, and although I never played a single snap with a professional jersey on my back I always felt like I owed so much to football because of all the things it gave to me. No matter how many times I hurt myself, not even when I needed a spine fusion in my neck did I change my opinion that football was one of the fondest memories of my youth.

As I watched this movie I remember the moment where my wife pressed paused to ask me, Hey honey are you okay? I didn't even know what to say to her. I said I was okay, but we both knew that what I was seeing had lifted the veil from my eyes. Will Smith does such a masterful job of playing the role of a man who refuses to relent in the face of such a horrendous truth. All of the characters in this movie help us all to see that this is more than just a fictitious story that we get to enjoy and then walk away from. This movie forces us all to face facts and come to grips with something that so many people have refused to see for far too long.

I blame no one but myself for my choices, but this movie has helped give me the lost piece of the puzzle to my life back. It helps me to understand all of the truly irrational behaviors that I have exhibited over the last 20 years of my life. Concussion is more than a movie. It is a gift to countless families who otherwise might lose their sons the same way we lost so many other players to this irresponsible and reckless sport. I wish I could meet the writers of this movie so I could hug them and thank them for the boldness of this movie and the message is speaks. Concussion has given my children, my wife, my parents and my colleagues a gift that I never can truly repay.

This is a movie that everyone should watch. Concussion is more than just a movie, it is a revelation, and it absolutely and completely changed my life.",1464307200,37,2451,4.006134969325154

7583268,5,B019T8QBR4,"This story is about concussions in football but it is a much more interesting story than I first thought before watching it.  It is the story about the doctor that discovered CTE and hIs personal battle against the NFL.

While I am not surprised at the scientific evidence or the NFL's reaction, I am surprised that Roger Goodell is still the NFL Commissioner and that others can watch this movie and not call for his immediate firing.  How can a man that denied scientific evidence now be the one in charge of overseeing and promoting player safety?

I also feel that the NFL should pay the doctor back for the $100,000 ([...])  of his own money that he actually spent with interest.  They should also fund his current research in investigating this disease further.  The Surgeon General who also seems to be absent now from public life should issue a warning on the dangers of playing football and specifically dangers at starting at an early age.",1464307200,,949,4.680722891566265

The cast as a whole was fantastic and the movie really brought this issue home. My fiance and I watched it together and both came away rethinking how we view the entire sport of football. I would certainly recommend the movie to everyone. I am a big football fan but even I came away with a new understanding of this issue and how many players can be impacted by CTE. The more diehard fans may not like the movie for obvious reasons, but I would still recommend you watch given the acting by the whole cast was phenomenal.

Beyond anything, the story was compelling and I really felt for the Dr. and his family. Will Smith does a fantastic job of bringing the character to life and helping you understand the difficult journey Dr. Omalu had to bring the truth to light.",1464134400,,938,4.329545454545454

Eventually the research done by the doctor, played by Will Smith, was listened to by the NFL --  but the problem still exists,  and the jury is still out on the helmets.

7583337,4,B019T8QBR4,"I am absolutely NOT a football fan, so normally I would avoid any movie having anything to do with that subject matter but knowing this was ""snubbed"" at the Oscars made me curious about it, so I rented it. Ok, just to get this out of the way...is it a good movie? Yes, it's absolutely a good movie. Is it Oscar-worthy? No, not in my opinion. Yes, Will Smith did do a really good job in this film too but how many times have other actors done an amazing job and not been nominated? (of any race)  It really turns me off when actors throw tantrums when passed up for the Oscar nod, granted it was his wife that threw the tantrum...not Will himself, I'm still a fan of his....hers, eh...not so much.

On to the movie...it's well paced, well written and it definitely keeps your attention; I enjoyed the medical/scientific aspect of what they were discussing as it applies to so many sports. It's a movie I can remember details to weeks later...that tells me how truly memorable it is, but it's not one I would add to my ""to buy"" list. It's not one I feel I will watch again, it was informative....but once was enough.",1462752000,,1114,4.350961538461538

7583340,5,B019T8QBR4,"Concussion is a sensitive, albeit controversial film, about a physician's true experience abut bringing the truth of repeated head injuries to light.  Unfortunately this revelation that ties head injuries with permanent brain damage affected the American idol, football. The NFL at the time, did not want to hear this truth.  This is the story of this physician's upward, persistent push to reveal the damage done by repeated head blows in this sport.",1462665600,,451,5.25

Will Smith does a great job in this movie and I would say that it was definitely one of his better movies. I even did some research after watching this movie and many of the things in this movie was true. Of course, they threw in some Hollywood, but overall it was a great movie.

This movie will definitely make you think and stir the soul.",1462406400,,514,4.457446808510638

7583363,5,B019T8QBR4,I really loved this movie and it is a great that this doctor stood up against the giants and it is sad how he was bullied but God helped him prevail over the liars.  We must realize that God is in control and that he created man and that there is nothing that he does not know about us.  No matter where you go he will find you because he created all living life forms.  We must remember that each day that we are alive on this planet.  God loves us and wants us to love one another.  Let's wake up and realize that life is worth the living.  Let's began to treat each other with love and respect.,1462147200,,597,3.9747899159663866

I will never watch another football game again the same way, now that I know the sad truth about the effects on the players - and their families.  It's a powerful movie, a powerful truth, though a hard one to realize - and it is very well done.  Will Smith's performance is excellent as always, as was Alec Baldwin's.  I loved it, I've recommended to everyone I've talked to since I watched it just 2 days ago.",1462147200,,584,4.263636363636364

7583378,5,B019T8QBR4,"What a movie! Will Smith seldom if ever gives a bad performance, and he nailed it this time also. It was not only a very good movie but it was also very informative. So I was not that surprised that Rodney Pete is having troubles with his brain. If the NFL can not protect their players more than they are doing right now, then maybe it's time for the game of football to be outlawed. I know that's a bold statement. I have men in my family who love to watch the games, as a large population of American's do, but they are not the ones who must die will before their time. What about their families? Maybe because of this movie their families can understand their problems better. I certainly hope so.",1461974400,,701,4.2781954887218046

7583381,5,B019T8QBR4,"I had to chuckle at the few one star reviews that said Smith is not a good actor and that the movie was boring. This is not a superhero movie nor a screwball comedy, it is a serious portrayal of serious subject matter and was very well done. Smith did a great job, the people that said it was poorly acted are like the inevitable ne're-do-well who will give the 5 star restaurant a bad rating just to be different, obviously most people who saw this movie loved it. This movie hits particularly close to home as I am from the Pittsburgh area and grew up watching the great Mike Webster and the other Steelers portrayed in this movie. My parish priest is the same priest who was was Dr. Omalu's priest and he seemed to like the movie, he is still friends with Omalu, if this movie was not good I'm sure he would have been more critical of it. If you like well acted dramas, see this movie. It is sad to think the NFL had knowledge of these dangers and did nothing to try and make the game safer before the revelations of Dr. Omalu came to light.",1461974400,,1044,4.199004975124378
7583382,3,B019T8QBR4,"I felt this movie was a good movie. I almost turned it off in the beginning because I was afraid the entire movie was going to be based on autopsies. I am not a fan of movies that are supposed to be, ""entertaining,"" but are full of death and sadness. I prefer movies that are funny or inspiring. However, I became interested in what the doctor was going to find and eventually interested on what the outcome would be for all parties. Turns out this movie was hardly entertaining at all. It was informative. I am glad to hear that the doctor was able to have his family and become a citizen. I was surprised to find out this was a true story and so recent. And I am sorry for the real families. The doctor was inspiring the way he fought to get the word out regardless of threats made to him. What better a movie than one that is a true and inspiring story? The main reason I did not give it a five star, is that they use profanity and used the Lord's name in vain.",1461974400,,964,4.105820105820106
7583383,5,B019T8QBR4,"why is always not an American that is credited for fixing the corruption by Americans in America. God, its so shameful.

 This is another Must See movie. The indomitable human spirit is a most beautiful thing to witness - watch with the whole family, your date or by yourself. It is an amazing journey - this is not a Football movie (that's only the backdrop) this is about discovery, about being right, and courage in the face of insurmountable odds fighting against you. Many analogies in one's life can be made about getting back up after being knocked down, they all apply while watching this true life film. Watch and be inspired, be motivated to be more, to overcome whatever may be holding you back.

The NFL's inadequate response to the problem and retaliation against those who spoke out about the dangers, as least as the movie portrays those things, was appalling. Knowing that the consequences of repeated concussions is so devastating, I'm really happy that my sons were too small to play high school football and didn't really get in to soccer.

7583420,3,B019T8QBR4,"This movie is based on a true story.  The plot is easy to follow, with the tone and theme revolving around the personal struggle of Dr. Bennet Omalu
and his wife. The movie starts out wonderfully, with the scientific discovery of CTE, that does not reveal itself with brain scans, by Dr. Bennet Omalu, from Nigeria. Then we see the  paper that is published in a scientific journal, and then the sparks start to fly as the NFL covers itself from publicly acknowledging that the disease exists, because they are concerned about the possibility of lawsuits. It is also clear that medical elite believes Dr. Omalu is a quack from Nigeria; since Nigeria is really known as that annoying country where the primary industry is teenagers sending emails to rich countries trying to get someone to hide 25 million dollars from a Nigerian King leaving his country.
The movie then becomes boring as we get deeper into the personal lives of the doctor and his wife. The movie should have stayed with the science and the process of the discovery of the disease, and what the NFL plans to do.  There was a big segment of the movie that was missing, and I feel the NFL had something to do with that process. Overall, a good movie that had the potential to be a great movie.",1461369600,,1257,4.553097345132743
7583421,5,B019T8QBR4,"Finally, Will Smith got one and hit it out of the park. He plays Dr. Bennett Omalu who was solely instrumental in coming up with the fact that so many football players had so many problems and so many had literally lost their minds sometimes to the point of killing themselves rather than possibly harming their families. he saw after they had died by studying their brains that the human brain was not built to take those kinds of blows. That is one part of this story (real it is, too) the rest was trying to get the NFL to come to terms with it and for that matter America too. Not only is the NFL a big business but a powerful one too. They never cared for the individual player just....MONEY. The Almighty Dollar. They even had certain governmental agencies in their pockets too. This Doctor virtually lost everything to try to save these football players and he was the only one. I love Football myself but I will forever find it hard to watch and not think of this movie. I can't stand the bloodthirsty corporations that have bought and paid for politicians.",1461369600,,1065,4.466666666666667

7583477,5,B019T8QBR4,"Oh, more than five stars! This is the most important cinematic work of this century. The national sport of the United States produces wrecks, destroys the brains of its players. And it had all been swept under the carpet by the NFL. We see young men who made scads of money for simply exercising their God-given talents in the current hysteria of capitalism, but in the process put their brains on the shelf as legal tender in the bargain. And yet no one thought this movie important enough to give it an Academy Award? Come on, people! Was this too a cover-up by the NFL? As a doctor I was thoroughly impressed by the illustration that we are all taught in medical school: that the brain is basically housed within a bony vault containing a small amount of fluid, and that when deceleration occurs the brain is suddenly thrown against the opposite side of that vault to a degree commensurate with the force of impact: if hard enough to cause profound impact a concussion results; if enough concussions occur, then irreversible brain injury results. At the end of the movie it was said that something like 26% of NFL players can expect to suffer some degree of brain damage. Can we afford this sort of reckless sacrifice? Not only as a country, but as a people of supposed advanced civilization. What a movie!",1461283200,,1309,4.622317596566524

But on the other hand, there wasn't anything special I saw that made his performance any better than any of the other Oscar nominees I saw, so i couldn't get very excited or perturbed that somebody else won.

Will Smith is most believable in this role and shows the goodness of this man! My favorite part of the movie is near the end when he speaks to the powers that be, showing honor to those lost as he also acknowledges the wonder of the game of football, the game so many have grown to love! He asks so gently that the 'business' of football also acknowledge the risks to those individuals/players that do the work, on the field, each and every game. Life after the game matters!

It's the exact same thing as what the cigarette industry did, & it's all blood money.

The worst part was having to watch a replay of that break twenty more times, with the announcers laughing with excitement.

It was yhe last time I sat down to watch football.

I am even more disgusted by the way that the NFL is still trying to sweep this under the rug. Too true that they settle willingly, but they make their players sign confidentiality clauses in the settlement.

I am also disgusted that Will Smith didn't win hundreds of awards for his portrayal of Dr. Omalu. When I watched the movie, there was no DJ Jazzy Jeff or Fresh Prince hanging out on the screen. Smith was obviously channelling Dr. Omalu.

No, there aren't any cars blowing up in the movie. There are no lurid sex scenes or major knock-down, drag out fights. I never laughed until I cried. Nonetheless, I was riveted from beginning to end.

My disdain for yhe NFL has gone to a new level of disgust. And my respect for Dr. Omalu AND Will Smith is going to be sung in every conversation I have for the next several weeks!!!",1460160000,2,1268,4.374468085106383

This film deserves all the praise heaped upon it and the performances were outstanding but I must say that with all the accolades pointed towards Will Smith performance the gold star belongs to David Morse. Its the scenes with Morse that drives home the devastating affects of CTE on an individual, how absolutely lost a footballer can become and how confused as to what is happening to them. The film is powerful and its not an anti-football film its an anti-ignorance film. The more known about the physical repercussions to long term professional game play the better equipped medical science and the NFL are in curtailing those repercussions. If there is a bad guy in this film its those within the NFL who refused to acknowledge the science they knew to be true at the expense of their players and in the interest of their profits. That's what it all boiled down to, money. Now athletes can choose to go into the game knowing the odds and what it may cost them. Parents can decide whether its worth their child's long term health to start them playing the game as early as is currently accepted. I've seen documentaries by PBS Frontline on this subject but this film adds the emotion missing in strict investigating journalism. I would encourage anyone who loves the sport to watch this film and to seek out the documentaries and news articles explaining the science behind a CTE diagnoses.",1460073600,,1416,4.7368421052631575
7583549,5,B019T8QBR4,"This film is especially important in light of the recent attempts to suppress the film Vaxxed about a CDC whistle blower who produced serious evidence of fraud that was even delivered to congress and read on the house floor.  When corporations like the NFL or Big Pharma join hands with the government to suppress truth we should all be worried. I have followed the career of several whistle blowers and sadly they mirror the life of the true life doctor portrayed in this film. Money CAN buy science and government harassment. Scientist have a right to publish and speak about their truth without facing trumped up charges brought by a corrupted FBI and the Medical industry. Many NFL players and their families, past and present are paying a terrible price because the NFL covered up what this man discovered.

Will Smith is awesome as always. His facial expressions, accent and demeanor in the film are really incredible given he was playing an older man,  Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist. Had the subject matter not been so damning to American football as a whole, I'm sure the film would have enjoyed huge critical acclaim.

7583556,5,B019T8QBR4,"The content illustrated an unwanted but warranted ""truth.""  Football is an unsafe, dangerous, unhealthy sport.  The rules need to be changed for those playing under 18 years of age and those that have or will suffer head trauma should  sue school systems, counties, cities, and states that allow the sport with current rules.  Colleges and universities that make money off of players should pay them at a rate that is slightly less than the pros compensated by  providing players with a free education.  I believe the rules need to be changed for college players as well making the sport safer.  I believe those entities supporting football, with current game rules,  for those under 18 are engaged in child abuse and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

I applaud this movie for bringing this evidence based information to light; Dr. Bennet Omalu the doctor who discovered Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and identified repetitive head injuries and football as a causative factor; and Will Smith for his outstanding acting and believable accent.

This movie should be played in health classes making sure all students see it at least once.  Students and parents both need to be informed so as to provide  knowledgeable consent prior to engaging in this and similar games.  With regard to the latter, soccer rules too need to be changed eliminating heading the ball.

School and university athletic programs should exist for the health of the participating students and not as a money making endeavor for the institution.  Life-long, healthful sports and physical activity should be given more support.  The emphasis in schools' physical education and/or athletic programs need to be devoted to activities that can and likely will be pursued throughout life to include : cycling, swimming, hiking, dancing ( social, line, hip hop, jazz, modern etc), yoga, t'ai chi, self defense,  judo and the like.  We need to spend more money on guiding students toward discovering their activity  passion and then allowing them to pursue it.  Excluding those with health concerns, schools should support at least one hour of physical activity daily.  Inculcating a love of daily activity will go a long way to mitigate health care costs in the future. Currently schools are contributing to disease by forcing a sedentary lifestyle with too many hours devoted to sitting still. It's no wonder Americans are obese.  Schools are contributing to it in a big way.

Foot ball is a game where the many, sedentary, unhealthy onlookers, most in desperate need of exercise, are sitting observing eleven players, desperately in need of less trauma and more rest.",1459987200,,2664,5.1016166281755195

7583566,4,B019T8QBR4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Perhaps the most controversial thing to happen to movies this past year was that revolving around race when it came to the Oscars. The flame that lit the fuse on the discussion came from Jada Pinkett Smith, actress and wife of Will Smith, who was upset that more blacks did not make the final cut when it came to the awards, especially since her husband had done such a wonderful job in the film CONCUSSION. The argument can be made for both sides of the issue but with the release this week of that film the time to discuss Smiths performance and whether or not it was Oscar worthy is at hand.

The movie features Smith in the true story of Dr. Bennett Omalu, an American immigrant and forensic neuropathologist in Pittsburgh who is doing the autopsy on Mike Webster. Webster was a star for the professional football team the Pittsburgh Steelers who had fallen on hard times after retiring suffering bouts or amnesia, dementia, depression and more while living out of his truck. Having died of an apparent heart attack at age 50, Omalu made a discovery while doing his autopsy on Webster.

While he had these various issues, Websters brain looked normal. While looking further into this Omalu discovers that Webster suffered from symptoms similar to those of professional boxers and in researching more issues with his brain tissue comes to the conclusion that he suffered from something unheard of before and which he names CTE of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. He publishes a paper on his findings alongside two well respected physicians and thats when things get nasty.

While Omalu thought that his findings would be greeted with praise from the NFL he instead finds them doing their best to ruin his reputation and to force him out of his lab. The big business aspect of the game comes at him full force when the league refutes his findings and calls for him to retract his paper. Knowing the paper is accurate he refuses and the attacks on his findings and personal life begin.

As all of this is proceeding Omalu is also discovering something he was never focused on before. With a bit of nudging from his pastor, he takes on a boarder and new immigrant to help her acclimate to the US, Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The two become close friends first and then find an attraction that leads them to marriage. As the attacks on Omalu continue they take their toll on Prema as well.

A legal battles ensues but not before Omalu finds a sympathetic ear in the form of Dr. Julian Bales (Alex Baldwin), a former physician for the Steelers. His conscious getting the better of him as ex-players he once patched up and sent back into the game begin dying from CTE, Bales assist Omalu not just in finding others who will back him up but in contacting NFL officials as well to bring this problem to into the limelight. Just what happens in the end makes for a well-made drama based on real life events that will make you think about the sport as well as those behind it.

It seems a poor choice of words to say that a movie based on such a tragedy is entertaining but the fact it that the movie does entertain as well as inform. There is not a bad performance among the entire cast here. This include David Morse in an almost unrecognizable part as Webster. Well shot, well directed and well written, the movie is one that everyone should see, in particular anyone hoping to involve their children in sports.

Which brings us to the question of Will Smith and his lack of a nomination for an Oscar for her performance here. When I think of the Oscar Ive always thought that the awards were supposed to single people out for exceptional work be it photography, writing, directing or acting. With acting it needs to be a performance that stands out, that displays something different for the actor involved from anything done previously and should be so exceptional as to be better than anyone else. While Smith does an admirable job here as he always does I don't think it was Oscar worthy. Yes its good but the best performance of any actor over the past year? I don't think so. Smith has developed from a rap star to serious actor over the years and will undoubtedly find that opportunity for an Oscar in his future. But this was not the role that would take him there.

The topic in the film is one that needs to be discussed and from the ending of the film make you wonder just how serious it has been taken. It isn't a cause movie but it does deliver an important message about the problems of injuries in major sports. Its a movie that is well worth renting and for fans of Smith and movies of this nature worth adding to your collection.",1459814400,,4703,4.549645390070922

It does this well but it also left me a little disappointed that it barely covered what the Dr's actually found on the slides which looked different.  There were plenty of opportunities for them to do this.  Maybe the writers/producers thought it would be too boring.  But honestly, the whole movie is about one thing so they should have explained it more.  Will Smith played the role very well and as the movie went on I no longer thought of the character being played by him.  I can see how he may have thought he could win an Oscar for it but other than the accent and body language of the doctor he was playing, there wasn't a whole lot of variation in the character to work with.

Concussion does a good job at telling the story that pro-football hasn't for many years wanted to be told.  Although some have commented on Smiths accent in the movie, I think this is one of his better dramatic roles that he has played in recent years.  His portrayal is believable and he does a good job at making the character affable.  As it is with movies that are based on true stories, there are some elements that are added for dramatic effect but the basis of the story remains true to the work of doctor.  I do think the love story part does seem to be a bit forced and added in for effect but in my opinion, this does not hurt my overall opinion of the movie which is both entertaining and well done.

My review simply rates a powerful, though not joyful, film.
A poignant dramatization of real people and situations. Some will fail to believe the NFL admitted knowing of concussion injury, CTE. Of course not all are so damaged. It is a fantastic game. Regardless, this story is vividly written, and the lead characters are extremely well presented by seasoned actors.

I sort of got the feeling that a lot of information was lost in Will Smith's labored attempt to ""ACT"" the part of the doctor.  Some information that is important to the truth was left out because I guess they thought it would clutter up the story.  It's too long anyway and lacks real drive so that one gets bored.  As it is an intensely interesting story, certainly shocking, I don't know how they managed to make it rather slow and boring.  I suggest that you obtain a copy of the Frontline program and watch it.

After watching this movie twice I can't stop thinking the about the African doctor who forced the NFL and then the rest of us to digest the ugly truth about our national pastime.

7583593,1,B019T8QBR4,"This film fails in several important regards. It lacks a clearly identified goal or through-line. The Nigerian accent affected by Will Smith is far more of a distraction than a convincing dramatic device. Most of the film has been printed annoyingly dark and gloomy in an obvious attempt to influence the mood of the audience. Finally you want to scream Turn on the lights! There are scenes in which, because of deliberate film underexposure and color grading, the only discernible facial features of black-skinned actors are the whites of their eye. And the romantic relationship comes across as forced and gratuitous.

If the movie were edited down to half of its length, it would still probably seem slow, tedious, boring and pretty much predictable. This movie lacks engaging suspense, which is an essential element in all films that succeed. The theme of this movie, regarding the long-term hazards of professional football, is certainly a worthy one. But the theme would be far better presented in an hour-long (or half-hour long) documentary than in a full-blown movie format.",1459468800,3,1083,5.11864406779661

After asking for samples of his brain Omalu discovers something he named CTE. When he goes to the NFL with this information they not only ignore him, but try and discredit him. When more and more bodies pile up he becomes hard to ignore. Anyone that watched football, and even most that don't have heard about this growing concern. Most also know that the NFL is trying to downplay the issue, but I didn't realize to what extent they were until this movie. All politics aside, I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was good, although I can see why Will Smith wasn't nominated, the real snub is Albert Brooks in this. He was great. Much like Moneyball or Draft Day this is a type of sports genre movie that isn't 100% about sports. Also much like the Big Short the movie will anger you the more you watch. It is possible to still love football and agree that it's dangerous and something needs to be done. That seems to be what the NFL is not understanding.

7583642,1,B019T8QBR4,"The true story Concussion is based on is a pretty good story, but turning it into a movie didn't end up with a very exciting result, it was like watching a documentary where we follow the one character and see everything pretty much through his eyes. That character is Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian immigrant working in the Pittsburgh morgue who disects corpses to know what killed them. He has more education under his belt than anyone working there and quickly puts two and two together that the man's odd behaviour before killing himself was caused by a brain injury, and upon learning about NFL football reaches the conclusion that the constant head clashes and periods of being concussed, even knocked out, damaged the man's brain. Further study of other deceased players supports his theory and he also hypothesizes that many players diagnosed with early Alzheimers also have the condition. The NFL however isn't going to acknowledge this and do everything they can to stop him speaking out.

Dr. Bennet Omalu is played by Will Smith who puts on an obvious fake accent. His mannerisms and fake accent reminded me of Eddie Murphy's character in the movie Coming to America. If he thinks he got snubbed for an Oscar for this performance, he's got to be kidding himself. Overall the movie felt like a low budget made for TV special, but we know it wasn't. It was a good story that needed to be told, but that doesn't make is automatically a good movie. Can't say I'd watch it a second time.

Also like TV movie style, instead of filming and showing us how things played out, Concussion goes with the cheap and lazy effort ending style of just putting up a heap of text blurbs on the screen.",1459123200,6,1692,4.655518394648829

7583647,3,B019T8QBR4,"The movie itself was very informative but I feel Will Smith could have focused his talent on a better project.  While the audience learned a lot about the NFL and CTE, it just was a bit much to expect the material to be made into a blockbuster.  Don't get me wrong, Will Smith absolutely nailed both the character and the accent.  However, it just simply was not a movie of Oscar worthiness.  I could see the arguement Jada Pinkett Smith has for her husband but I also see the academy's point in not even nominating him for the Oscar, and that was based squarely on the lackluster movie that is Concussion.

I saw the movie in the theater with some friends and I believe we all felt the same after walking back to our cars.  Great information but was it enough to spend hours of our time and our money on?  For me, the answer was no.  If you are a huge Will Smith fan or wanted to learn more about CTE then you should check the movie out.  If you are looking to spend a couple hours losing yourself in a fun, action packed, dramatic thriller then I would look elsewhere.  It wasn't horrible but it just didn't have that Hollywood thrill to it for me.

7583651,5,B019T8QBR4,"This is a fantastic movie, and the gripes of the people who disagree seem petty or outright fake. Most take aim at Smith directly, or hint at a sub par story without really mentioning why it was done poorly. The movie covered a lot of material, and I think it did it very well. The plot of the movie is no secret. You get the gist of the plot from the premise of the movie; NFL tries to cover up health risks of football, and a guy finds out the risks and exposes them. It's all in the trailer, and all of this was in the news at one point, and it's all on Wikipedia. This movie just tries to tell the story to a wider audience, and it does so exceedingly well. Another gripe I saw was that someone thought the documentary on the subject was more informative. That's great; what are they going to tell us next, that a potato is a potato? Show of hands, who in their right mind thinks that a movie made for entertainment is more educational than a documentary meant to inform?

If you look at other Smith movies (even extending to those with his son Jaden in them, who they always, without fail, compare to his father) I think you'll notice a similar trend; people gripe about nonsense, and usually say something bad about Smith, or they're looking for something to complain about. Anyone can find anything in any movie to complain about; it isn't hard. But what kind of people watch movies just to complain about them? Apparently Will Smith ""fans"" do. Because almost all of his movies are great, and they're all rated slightly lower than they should be, because a chunk of people seem to get on to every single one of his (and even his kids) movies and bash them.  Take The Karate Kid remake with his son in it. Great movie. Any other movie that good would have been a 4.5 star movie. Nope. People got to get on and bash Jaden Smith. 4 stars.  This movie? Should be a 4.5 star movie, easily. But what is it? 4 stars. It just goes to show that a majority of the people haven't lost their minds, but the few who have, the random Smith haters, rate it lower.

Trust me, if you want a great story with great acting and get the movie.

If you want just the information and don't want a story, why are you buying a movie? There's a documentary.

But I'm assuming that, since you're in the movie section looking at a movie, you probably want a movie. So I very highly recommend this movie; it's great,",1458518400,64,2394,4.27373068432671

Smith does a great job with the writing he has, but the story required me to actually look up a few of the names being tossed around while I was watching it to get some sense of when this was happening and even what exactly took place. Everything in the story is told in a very vague sort of way where you get the overview (i.e. - this person died and this is how the body was found or what they were doing at the moment of death) but there is no depth to it. I can sort of understand this as the focus is not meant to be on the football players themselves but on the doctor and the diagnosis, however, the movie portrays these ex-players as basically all having an identical series of events leading to death that would be honestly so rare for them all to do in this exact same way as to cause suspicion even in the biggest skeptic long before the NFL tried to debunk any of the claims. Yet, I would imagine it would have to be at least slightly more roundabout than that (how each player died or at least other factors that could be pointed to) for the NFL to have had the ability to fight the claims of bearing responsibility at all and the movie doesn't even touch on what those other factors might be so this leaves another gap in the story. There's even a point where time passes in the doctor's career and the only way the audience knows this is because there is graying in his hair at this point. What's he been up to? What has been happening on the NFL/concussion front? Who knows, because the story is poorly written.

So that's the overall takeaway from my perspective - a good actor making due working with sub par story telling and making it as good as he can.",1458432000,8,1841,4.185915492957746

It didn't flow well. the photography/filming/design team did a great job. This is the problem with Hollywood, they cast well-known actors vs. good actors. Will Smith should stay in comedy, or get better training to improve his acting skills and a speech therapist, and expert in other languages to do this type of roll. It's like giving a guy a chance at a great role, and the individual not working harder to execute. I give the guy an A+ story and his delivery is C- in overall performance. Hollywood lowers the bar so what, a Will Smith can feel honored? The comedians who think they can act, are the fools in Hollywood. Newsflash - this is why you didn't even make it to the Oscars as even a heavyweight contender. Although you tried with the move Ali (as a heavyweight), the IMDB rating gives Will a 6.8 rating = a middleweight contender (aka a ""C"" rating).",1458259200,,1037,4.550802139037433

7583677,5,B019T8QBR4,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Concussion""

1. This is the most important - and dangerous - movie about American culture this year. There's a possibility that participation in America's most popular sport will drop because of this movie.

2. It tells the true story of how Dr. Bennett Omalu, a Pittsburgh forensic pathologist, stumbled onto evidence of brain damage in many NFL football players, which he ended up naming chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). It also portrays the NFL's attempts to bury and discredit Omalu for seven years, until the evidence was so overwhelming they couldn't deny it anymore.

3. It was written and directed by Peter Landesman, who is an award-winning journalist (in 2004 he wrote an article about the child sex trade that led to many arrests). Landesman based the script off a 2009 GQ expose written by Jeanne Marie Laskas.

4. The movie comes out strongly against the way football is currently played. It makes bold statements, even suggesting that God doesn't want people playing football.

5. Landesman surely knows how incendiary this topic can be, and the script is very careful to focus a lot on the science behind Omalu's work. I was impressed with the way science is treated in this movie. I even learned things about autopsies.

6. Will Smith deserves a nomination for Best Actor of the year. It's sometimes hard to tell that it's actually him.

7. The movie is part biography, part medical investigation, and part conspiracy drama. It's hard to squeeze everything in. While his personal life is interesting, it unbalances the flow of things a little bit. Some scenes are kind of awkwardly placed.

8. The movie teaches you enough about CTE to make you realize that there's no real fix for it. It made me realize that the NFL's attempts to make changes (such as strengthening the ""targeting rule"") are clearly for show, and don't really do anything.

9. CTE is fairly well known now, but watching the 13-year process be condensed into one movie gives a new appreciation for what's going on. The movie also shows just how deep the corruption and conspiracy of the NFL's handling of the subject was, Whether you like football or not, this movie is an important critique of one of the defining elements of American culture.",1457136000,9,2264,4.875

7583682,4,B019T8QBR4,"It's so rare for the NFL to put their stamp of approval on anything that when they do it's a cause for concern, especially when the film is dealing with traumatic brain injury suffered by its players. The issue is one the NFL resisted for a long time, denying there was a problem even as reports streamed in that some were suffering long-term effects from repeated blows to the head on the gridiron. So when reports surfaced that Concussion, Peter Landesman's film on the subject, may have been neutered to maintain a happy relationship between the NFL and Sony Pictures, the expectation was the film would be totally toothless. Draft Day minus the humor.

Well, it's not. Concussion takes the NFL to task and retains all of the startling revelations that rocked the biggest and most lucrative sport in the world. That it manages to be a stirring story of one outsider's battle against a corporate juggernaut is the film's greatest achievement, though, because the goal clearly is to instruct and inform as well as entertain. The Erin Brockovich template is in full effect here, based on the revealing 2009 GQ article ""Game Brain"" about Dr. Bennett Omalu (Will Smith), a straight-laced forensic pathologist who discovered in 2002 that seemingly healthy NFL players were dying way too young. And not just that, but some, like in the case of Pittsburgh Steelers great, Mike Webster (played convincingly by David Morse), had defects in their brains that were driving them to commit suicide.

Of course, nobody wants to hear that there's a connection that leads back to the NFL, but what's surprising is that Omalu's detractors come from all sides. Of Nigerian descent, Omalu is seen as an outsider among outsiders. He doesn't watch football or even understand the sport, and his dispassionate look at the evidence drives the fiery followers of the sport to rip him in the press. Coining the term Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (or CTE), Omalu is forced to look for help where he can find it, joining with his mentor Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks, providing a dose of comic relief),and fellow doctors Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) and Ron Hamilton (Stephen Moyer) in what looks like an impossible fight. The goal is to bring awareness to the problem, but beyond that they need the NFL to admit the crisis even exists.

""You're going to war with a corporation that owns a day of the week. The same one the church used to own"", says Wecht at one point. But Omalu comes to the realization that ""God did not intend for us to play football.""  Good luck telling millions of rabid fans that; or the wealthy players who have only ever known football all of their lives.

At first it seems the film is going to be an offbeat medical procedural in the vein of House. Omalu is a man with a special kind of devotion to his work, speaking to the dead and claiming it helps him find the cause of their death. With his headphones on and his natural aversion to social graces (mainly due to cultural differences), Omalu isn't someone the establishment even wants to support. As an immigrant he has a view of the American Dream that others simply don't have. He thinks revealing the damage football has caused is what a good American should do, and is surprised when it actually makes him public enemy #1. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson, badly miscast), who doesn't come off so well in this film at all, publicly denounces Omalu and all of his findings. So does former Chicago Bears great, Dave Duerson (Adewale Akkinuoye-Agbage), until the disease hits him on a personal level.

His desire to prove himself a worthy American citizen is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of Omalu's story. Landesman's screenplay occasionally spends too much time on his personal life where he forges a romantic relationship with Prema (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, solid but underused), a fellow Nigerian who has more of an appreciation for the sport than he does. Some thriller elements emerge, like when Omalu and Prema start getting scary phone calls, but they aren't as convincing as his scientific quest for the truth.
In his best role since Ali, Will Smith sports a solid Nigerian accent and presents Omalu as a man of deep faith and conviction. This has turned out to be a Hell of a comeback year for Smith (along with the underrated Focus); putting himself back on the map as one of today's top leading men. He just needs the right material, and Concussion provides that for him. We always want to see him as the champion for what's right, and Smith is more comfortable in that kind of role. In a David & Goliath story such as this, Smith is the kind of guy audiences want to see in their corner. Concussion isn't perfect, but it's well-acted and accomplishes the one thing it really needed to which is dare to defy the might of the NFL.",1455667200,4,4808,4.738351254480286
7583683,3,B019T8QBR4,"The premise of this movie is quite good, pity they used Will Smith as the lead actor. He sorely under plays the needed tension and basically makes it a snore. I'm sorry he is a one trick pony and the last few movies he made have been weak. I don't understand why the folks who cast movies don't take chances with better actor's.

7583684,3,B019T8QBR4,"The Good:
Will Smith delivers a very good performance. He may even have you believing that he's really South African with the way he nails the accent. The only competition Will had was probably the story of the film itself. If you're not an big football fan then a lot of the information presented in this film will probably be new to you. It's definitely interesting to see this controversial depiction of the issue of concussions in football. Also there's a good supporting cast surrounding Smith. While Alec Baldwin does a nice job, Albert Brooks' dry humor is perfectly timed and a welcome addition to the film.

The Bad:
There's nothing really that bad about this film. It is slowly paced, and it's probably not the best movie to watch late at night.

The Reason:
Overall, Concussion was a good movie. The main goal of this film is to spread awareness of the danger of concussions in football. Forgive me for not jumping on the ""This was Will Smith's best performance"" bandwagon. I think that Smith did a great job, but he didn't do anything that was beyond normal expectations for him. His performance in Pursuit of Happiness was better, in my opinion. As for seeing Concussion in the theaters, I don't think that's a must. It's perfectly fine to be seen as a matinee or just wait to watch it at home.

The Rating: 7/10

He discovered that humans are not ment to play football because we don't have the head capacity to take that kind of impact. Thing of 2 goats with horns fighting each other they can take that kind of impact where humans doing foot ball tackling would end up like many of the football players with massive brain injuries some almost unrecognizable as you will in the movie and they did to end the pain they were feeling which result in heart attacks or suicide. Dr Ben job was to exposed this problem and what is blocking him is the NFL . this powerful sport organization will do everything in its power to discredit this claim even try to taunt his family with fear.

Players know the risks for obtaining fame, money, fan worship, gaining an education through scholarships.

The latter part of the movie was less intriguing to me, especially without the physical evidence from neuro-science scanning imagery; that will be years away to show the subtleties of brain damage at the NFL level.

7583697,4,B019T8QBR4,"In his best role since 2001s Ali, Will Smith delivers and understated but powerful performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian emigre.  Omalu, in 2002, working as a pathologist in Pittsburgh discovered that constant brain trauma caused athletes, especially professional football players to literally go mad.

Director Peter Landesman guides the film gently through the original discovery during an autopsy of Hall of Fame player Mike Webster (David Morse) of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  When Omalu discovers the same evidence in other players who died or committed suicide at a relatively young age, he takes his findings to his boss, Dr. Wecht (Albert Brooks), eventually getting his worked published in a noted medical journal.  His evidence is shunned by the NFL, their lawyers and medical staff.  Omalu gets assistance and advice from the former Steelers medical doctor, Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin).

In a tangential story line, Omalu, a deeply religious man, accepts responsibility for the care of another recently arrived young woman from Africa, Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), at the insistence of his minister.  A little unusual, I must say but Omalu is all hands off until he isnt.  They eventually marry.

When the athletes deaths continue to mount, the NFL eventually takes note and some action is taken to make concussion safety more of an issue.  The question is, how long did they hide the truth of what they knew.  While there have been numerous presentations of this issue, including television and documentary exposes, Concussion will likely earn a larger and wider audience.  The crime, it seems to me, is not presenting the evidence to athletes and their families, so an informed decision can be made as to whether they want to take on the risk of humiliation, bankruptcy and potentially death.

7583698,4,B019T8QBR4,"Being a longtime fan of the New England Patriots, I can vividly remember asking my mom when I was younger if I could sign up for football. She said no, because of my slender frame and because she didn't want me to get hurt. I eventually turned to basketball as I got older (and taller), but football has always been a joy to see. Its truly a engaging sport.

The joy to watch football however, has disturbing consequences on the players themselves as evidenced while watching Concussion. Dr. Bennet Omalu makes a startling discovery after one of Pittsburgh's beloved football stars commits suicide. Little does Dr. Omalu know, tackling the issue of CTE(chronic traumatic encephalopathy)  head on will not be an easy task.

Will Smith was his charming self in the 2015 film Focus, but in Concussion he delivers a sensational performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu. I should point out that the real Dr. Bennet Omalu is Nigerian and Will Smith does a really good job changing his accent so that he sounds Nigerian. But above all else, Will Smith shows a full commitment to his role. I also really enjoyed Alec Baldwin's role as Dr. Julian Bales and Gugu Mbatha-Raw's role as Prema Mutiso.

Concussion also does a nice job of paying attention to detail and informing the audience of the consequences of continuous head trauma. Its not always the easiest film to watch in those regards, but Concussion keeps a steady pace until the movie's conclusion.

It may not exactly be Will Smith's Oscar time just yet, but this is one of his best performances in years and for Concussion, that is more than enough.",1451606400,3,1592,4.7328519855595665
7583699,5,B019T8QBR4,"Football is a great American tradition and you don't mess with tradition. That's why this film should be seen by every parent in the country. This was a tough role for Will Smith to play because he LOVES American football, but the message is so vital he couldn't turn it down. We watch a Pittsburgh forensic pathologist from Nigeria discover the long-term effects of brain trauma suffered by football players during normal play.

This provocative movie is written and directed by Peter Landesman (""Kill the Messenger""); he based his script on ""Brain Game,"" a thought-provoking article written by Jeanne Marie Laskas and published in GQ magazine.

The top-notch cast includes:
  * Will Smith (""Focus"") as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a highly qualified immigrant from Nigeria who challenges one of America's most beloved sports. He is a good and decent man completely outflanked by his opponents, who call him an uneducated quack. (He has numerous post-graduate degrees.)
  * Alec Baldwin (""Blue Jasmine"") Pittsburgh Steelers physician Dr. Julian Bailes is NOT happy when a foreign-born doctor makes his allegation. All Bailes knows is that he has lost a good friend.
  * Albert Brooks (""The Simpsons"") Coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht can't see past his budget limitations, so he makes his resident pathologist pay for his own additional testing.
  * Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Jupiter Ascending"") Prema Mutiso is of the opinion that her roommate is a fine and honorable man who speaks for the dead when no one else will...so she marries him!
  * David Morse (""Treme"") ""Iron Mike"" Webster has everything riding on the outcome of this controversial issue. He becomes the poster child for traumatic brain injury.
  * Eddie Marsan (""Sherlock Holmes"") Dr. Steven DeKosky sees Dr. Omalu's paper first and has trouble denying the science, so he makes an important decision.
  * Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (""Trumbo"") Dave Duerson denies help to his former teammate and the evidence put before him. He may come to regret this....

Follow the money...that describes the overwhelming challenge our hero has when he tries to speak the truth. This is David - vs - Goliath: a lone doctor taking on one of the largest, most profitable organizations in the world. He uses science; they counter with racism. We certainly have someone to root for, and plenty of others to loathe.

This is PG-13, so all those grade-school-age wannabe football heroes can see it. Expect no sweaty bodies, no gun play, no vehicular mayhem and no blowie uppie stuff, but you WILL see a couple of autopsies in living color. Just appreciate this group of very able actors who ask a compelling question about a massive American institution.",1451520000,25,2669,5.054794520547945
7583700,4,B019T8QBR4,"This movie stars Will Smith as a Nigerian immigrant to America named Dr. Bennet Omalu, who is very scrupulous in his job of performing autopsies.  He discovers that the brains of former football players who have become mentally ill and committed suicide don't look like they're damaged anatomically, but functionally, they are, as the repetitive head trauma from football playing causes their brains to malfunction as they're jarred out of place.  By the end of the movie, it's evident that the movie is not preaching to you about HOW to amend the current situation, but exposing a problem which the NFL tried to cover up for years.  The NFL's response to the issue is similar in ways to the tobacco and soft drink industries, which rigged the studies designed to investigate them so that they wouldn't be held accountable.  But rather than an overt ""message movie"" exposing corruption and calling for social change, the movie ""Concussion"" is mostly focused on telling the story of a heroic individual, but that human emphasis on Dr. Omalu incorporates elements of a message movie, drama, suspense, romance, immigrant story, and legal drama.

Will Smith has said in interviews that he has a harder time enjoying watching football now, because of what he learned by doing this movie.  When he was producing The Karate Kid remake which starred his son Jaden, he would go back and forth from Beijing to Los Angeles and back to Beijing each weekend for 10 solid weeks to watch his oldest son play high school football, because he loved football that much.  (GQ.com story entitled ""Football Lover Will Smith on Playing the Man Who Fought the NFL"")  He felt a moral obligation to play the role because he wants people to be aware of the risks.  He was kind of reluctant going into the role because he felt compelled by the Nigerian immigrant doctor's story, but because he loved football so much, he kind of wanted to get out of playing it.  In his performance, he masters the accent of the Nigerian immigrant doctor perfectly, and I think his performance and Tobey Maguire's Bobby Fischer performance in ""Pawn Sacrifice"" were two of the most engrossing biographical performances in recent history, and both happen to be in this same year of 2015.

The music is, like most movies, not very memorable, and the visual hue tends to be grim and not have many bright images, but the movie is definitely engrossing.  Close-ups are overused, in my opinion, and the editing sometimes could've been more concise, but I think it's well-written and well-acted.  It is the performance of Will Smith that carries the movie more than anything else.  I hope to learn more about the true and false parts of the story, and that the movie inspires some drastic change for people's health's sake.  Once truth has been revealed, it becomes people's duty to respond to it responsibly, and hopefully there will be some change to how the game of football is played because of it.  It was quite a gutsy movie for Sony to produce and for every actor who signed on to it.  Hopefully it will do more than just inform people, but actually lead to some changes.  As Dr. Omalu says in the movie, God didn't create people to handle impact to their heads like woodpeckers can.",1451260800,11,3238,4.772401433691757
