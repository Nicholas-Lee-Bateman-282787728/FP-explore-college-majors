34247,5,0780023161,"Criterion notwithstanding, this collection of three movies directed by Jean Cocteau is no trilogy. Rather the three works represent three quite different views of the Poet-the prototypic artistic creator for Cocteau--at three different moments in his career. The first, Blood of a Poet (1930) released at the same time as L'Age d'Or of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali-both pictures were financed by the wealthy patron of the arts, the Vicomte de Noailles-is the most ""Orphic"" of three, and like L'Age d'Or very much in the vein of French experimental films of the 1920s, with an abundance of symbolism and rejection of conventional narrative syntax. Less radically innovative than L'Age d'Or, Blood of a Poet is like a brilliant book of sketches, some of which work, some of which don't.
Cocteau made no films for over a decade, and only returned to the cinema during the Occupation with The Eternal Return, for which he wrote the screenplay. Although directed by Jean Delannoy, the film was clearly Cocteau's own creation, and marked both the beginning of a period of fertile cinematic collaboration with Jean Marais and a new phase in Cocteau's contributions to film. The masterpiece of this period is, of course, Orpheus (1949). Cocteau had begun in Blood of a Poet by radically breaking with realism. Now he set about showing how the images of modern life could be invested with a mythic power of their own.
In The Eternal Return, Cocteau had put the story of Tristan and Yseult into a modern setting, but without the least hint of irony. In updating the myth of Orpheus to post-World War II Paris, however, he adopted a very different strategy. The Thracian singer becomes a rich and famous writer (Jean Marais) who supplies exactly what the public looks for in literature. At the beginning of the film, Orpheus boasts to an older retired writer, ""The public loves me!"" And the latter tartly retorts, ""The public is alone."" But as a result of the unforeseen adventure he lives through in the film, an adventure in which he confronts and falls in love with his own Death (Maria Casares), Orpheus momentarily becomes the Poet he never has been.
Cocteau had placed the myth of the sacrifice of the Poet at the center of Blood of a Poet, and he explicitly articulates it in Orpheus: ""The death of a poet requires a sacrifice to make him immortal."" However, the ""real"" Poet, from this point of view, is not Orpheus-who goes back to happily settle down in bourgeois bliss with his expectant wife-but Cegeste (Edouard Dermithe), who becomes the servant of Death, and unquestioningly transmits the messages from the underworld (read: the unconscious). The Poet has to sacrifice himself in order to be more than a writer-""A writer without being a writer,"" is how he defines the poetic vocation before the Judges of the Underworld-but Orpheus will never have the courage to make that choice by himself.
Not the least astounding thing about Orpheus is the assurance with which Cocteau handles the machinery of commercial film production. Orpheus is hardly a mainstream production by American standards, but it has no ragged edges, technically speaking. The film was strikingly photographed by Nicolas Hayer and it makes a highly adroit use of special effects shots, whose primitive magic Cocteau understood and employed quite effectively. The musical score is by Georges Auric, a member of Les Six who has to rank with Bernard Herrman as one of the major composers of film music in the history of motion pictures. Last but not least, Orpheus has a formidable cast, including-in addition to Jean Marais-Franois Perier as Heurtebise, Maria Dea as Eurydice, Juliette Greco as her friend Aglaonice, Roger Blin as the older poet, and the sublime Maria Casares as the most glamorous personification of Death ever to appear on the screen.
Viewers will likely have the most difficulty getting into the third movie, The Testament of Orpheus. Cocteau's adieu to the screen is a work filled with spontaneity and invention, so impulsively unstructured as to make Blood of a Poet look like Racinian tragedy. Cocteau plays a traveler lost in time who goes in search of Pallas Athene, but this is a mere pretext for stringing together a series of adventures, like the narrative premise of a picaresque novel. Testament of Orpheus was a movie ahead of its time when it came out 1959, and it remains so today. Possibly its release in DVD may serve to make it known to a wider audience.

Criterion has done itself proud with this set. Anyone inclined to balk might consider that three DVDs of this quality at the price are already a bargain. The picture and sound quality of all three movies, each of which has been digitally remastered, is superb. Blood of a Poet was especially impressive in this respect, and I felt as if I were seeing it for the first time. In addition, The Orphic Trilogy includes a wealth of supplementary material such as essays and pronouncements by Cocteau.

The set also contains two other films en marge of a non-fictional variety. One of these is Villa Santo Sospir, a 16mm picture about the home of Cocteau's neighbor on the Riviera, Mme. Alec Weisweiller, which he had extensively decorated. Mainly a record of art works, Villa Santo Sospir is his only extended work in color. The other, far more interesting, is a documentary about Cocteau's life entitled Autobiography of an Unknown by Edoardo Cozarinsky. Unfortunately, the picture quality is often dupey and unsatisfactory, but the film provides a number of invaluable interviews from the later phase of Cocteau's career.
Anyone who enjoys The Orphic Trilogy should definitely consider purchasing the Criterion DVD of Beauty and the Beast, and the videotapes of The Eternal Return, The Storm Within (Les Parents terribles), and The Strange Ones (Les Enfants terribles), all available from Amazon.com.",1050624000,57,5859,4.965376782077393
34248,5,0780023161,"Let me start off by saying that the trilogy itself is a treasure, well worth the price to have these three spectaculary surreal masterpieces in one set and having Criterion give it their famous treatment (even though we reeeeally need to include more extras). My review at the moment is regarding the midle film, 'Orpheus'. You might all be a little familiar with the greek myth by now as I was, but Cocteau's treatment and interpretation are simply stunning. The film by itself is fascinating, I think it has that kind of quality that some foreign films have that whether or not you're used to subtitles you will enjoy the film. Jean Marris (Cocteau's real life lover) is fascinating in the role of Orpheus. Even though the role doesn't seem that complicated and I see him more as a medium with which Cocteau comunicates all that he wants to say about beauty, death, love and above all art. I think that is the basic question the movie brings up: what exactly is art? what makes good art? and how big a role does love play in the artistic process? But those are just hidden treats throughout the movie, and those who pay most attention are the ones who will notice that the movie is indeed deep and fascinating in its own respect. The sequences where Orpheus descends into death's underworld are simply fascinating to experience. Cocteau seems to retry some of the cinematic 'tricks' from his 'Blood of a Poet' and manages to invent some new ones in the process, this aspect is also fun to watch and adds a level of technical wizardry to an already beautiful and stunningly surreal masterpiece. The cinematography is at times also very good, some of the shots are composed in a very difficult way it may seem, and we wonder what exactly is behind the decisions to film in that particular way. All the other actors are also spectacular in their parts, but I think that the actress who played death could have had a lot more impact, maybe with another actress (Cocteau wanted Greta Garbo at first, imagine that!). The costumes and the sets are fantastic. But I think that this film is most valuable becuase it is the perfect way to introduce yourself to surreal cinema and it might also be a good way to get into french cinema, the film is an undoubted masterpiece, it has stood the test of time and it keeps raising deep questions in the viewer's minds to this day. I highly recommend 'Orpheus' and the Orphic Trilogy, if you like Cocteau I'd also check out 'Beauty and The Beast', and if you're a fan of the surreal I recommend trying out Buuel. Thanks for reading, hope this helps. All in all, I'd rate this film a 9 out of 10!",1035331200,9,2629,4.536842105263158
34249,5,0780023161,"Jean Cocteau, who would later go on to direct such classics as ""Orpheus"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" began with this short (50min.) non-narrative film. ""Blood of a Poet"" (included in Criterion's ""Orphic Trilogy"" in a solid print) explores the figurative and literal blood and sweat that goes into creating a work of art. The film starts with an image of a tall chimney as it starts collapsing (an image that will now probably be impossible to separate from the World Trade Center collapsing) and then shifts to an artist that is painting a portrait. The film then follows this artist as he literally becomes one with his art (the portrait's mouth attaches itself to his hand), as he falls into the world on the other side of the mirror (where he sees such things as an opium den and a child being whipped and implored to take flight), and as he eventually shoots himself in the head to receive ""eternal glory"", and is immortalized in the form of a statue.
The film the shifts to a schoolyard where the statue of the artist is sitting, as a snowball fight erupts. One young child is knocked out and left bloody after the fight. Then the schoolyard reveals itself as a stage with noble spectators. A poet and a woman begin to play cards. The woman tells the poet ""If you do not have the Ace of Hearts, then you are lost."" The poet, realizing he doesn't have it, pickpockets it from the unconscious boy. Then the boy's guardian angel appears, covers the boy, and takes back his Ace. The poet, without the Ace, kills himself. The crowd applauds. The woman reveals herself to be Death, and wanders off talking of the mortal desire for immortality. We then see the chimney from the film's start collapse completely, suggesting the artist's dilemma lasted only a few seconds.
The film is exceptionally vivid. The imagery used here is still stunning despite its low-tech nature. The film's implication that the artist must ... his childhood for inspiration (signified as the Ace of Hearts is stolen), that the artist must view the world as a distortion (viewable through all the bizarre images on display), and that both artistic integrity and fame come at a great price (signified by the multiple suicides in the name of ""glory"") are all never explicitly stated, but are deeply felt through the images. The film is exceptional in its evocation of the artist's dilemma, and anyone with an analytical mind would find plenty to digest here.",1001289600,8,2429,4.704225352112676
34250,4,0780023161,"I love Criterion, I own 21 of their current DVD catalogue, but I must admit to being a little disappointed in some of their current releases. The extras, as ever, are more than fine. No, the problem is with the picture.  Despite being far better than anything else on the market, the picture has  a slightly oversharp, grainy quality that has been indicative of several of  Criterion's current DVD releases (Chasing Amy, The Last Temptation of  Christ) and some artifacting at times as well. Film grain is to be  expected, after all these are old films, but digital grain is not. Don't  get me wrong, these are not awful by any means; and if you love these  films, like I do, you won't find a better package, it's just that Criterion  have set such high standards for themselves that any slip up is noticed.",963100800,10,807,4.555555555555555

Along with the crystal clarity of the films, the new  and improved English subtitles give us so much more than the eariler VHS  versions.  Possibly even more important than the films is the documentary,  Jean Cocteau:  Autobiography of an Unknown included as a bonus on the first  disc, this alone is worth the price.  I suggest that one watches the  Autobiography before watching the films.  If one understands the poet, one  understands the poetry, hence one better understands oneself.",961718400,8,649,4.853211009174312
34252,5,0780023161,"The Orphic trilogy is a cause for celebration becuase it is truly a treat for the artist in us all. We get to see a filmmaker's perspective of film from three totally different angles, one as a young man, trying and inventing new ways to use the camera (THE BLOOD OF A POET) to the  mainstream artist trying to tell a middleground art versus convention story  (ORPHEUS) to an old man, giving his last thoughts on celluoid as poetry  (THE TESTAMENT OF ORPHEUS). Do not buy these DVD if you are not a fan of  the surreal!  Cocteau himself says these movies are dream worlds and he  means it. If you have a hard time following imagery and symbols you will be  easten alive by these movies. But if film is like fine wine to you, getting  more complex with each sip, you are in for a treat.
Criterion as always  does a marvelous job from top to bottom from packaging to supplemental  work. The essays included are extrememly interesting as are the two  additional films provided.",957225600,28,974,4.446327683615819

7789760,5,0780023161,"The Blood of a Poet - Orpheus - The Testament of Orpheus - even the titles are evocative!

Superlatives fall short in attempting to describe these magical, dreamlike films, so rich with myth & beauty & mystery. Cocteau accomplishes something very difficult: he manages to be in control of his symbols, but handles their reins with a deceptively casual touch, so that there's never a hint of didactic rigidity, which would be death to such works. The overall atmosphere remains mysterious, with meaning only partially glimpsed, something that's felt on a complex level. There's plenty of room for analysis, to be sure -- part of the fun is discussing the films with others! -- but it's never a cut-and-dried matter of Symbol A = Object B. Like actual dreams, they exist & work in many dimensions at once, never exhausting their depths.

There's a lesson here for modern filmmakers as well -- the special effects are simple, perhaps even crude by contemporary standards -- but they not only work superbly, they outshine the fanciest CGI available today. And why? Because they exist to serve the artistic purposes of the films & their creator, not simply to dazzle the audience with superficial technique & explosive eye candy. There's always the genuine sense of the unknowable, of the otherworldly -- these are films that plunge deeply into the psyche, draw their enduring power from that underworld, and reward repeated viewings.

And in case that sounds much too sober & daunting, let me add that they're both a visual & intellectual delight. Yes, there's plenty of Meaning ... but they're also out-and-out enjoyable, always offering something new & startling. You don't need a handful of university degrees to appreciate them! The simultaneous shock & pleasure of encountering the marvelous is more than sufficient.

In short, this collection is an essential work of art -- most highly recommended!",1213833600,4,1900,5.04140127388535
7789761,5,0780023161,"Orpheus is the second film in the Orphic Trilogy by Jean Cocteau and after watching ""The Blood of a Poet"" it makes much more sense. You are thrown into a similar world, and if you embrace the magical realism that is somewhat haunting, it becomes quite a delicious story with a purpose.

Based on the Greek myth of Orpheus, the main couple, Orpheus the poet and his wife the somewhat fragile Eurydice (killed by a motorbike instead of a snake), experience life in a world where they are presented with otherworldly temptations and serious life-changing contemplations.

They visit a strangely modern underworld where Orpheus seems to be looking for death/the Princess or perhaps Persephone (queen of the underworld - but she seems to be more like the temptress/siren in this movie) more than his recently departed wife. She seems to have a good sense of humor and reminds the participants of her plots not to look back lest they be turned into pillars of salt, as she remembers from the past.

There are all sorts of lovely visual metaphors like ""kiss of death"" and other ideas you pick up on as you are watching the story unfold. Just as in ""The Blood of a Poet,"" we find humans moving through mirrors as easily as their underworld conspirators. Death falls in love with a poet, although we assume he fell in love with the idea of her first. In a way, he writes her into his life.

Everyone seems to live in reality all while moving from death to life and from life to death. Keeping up with who is dead and who is alive only makes it all the more fun. It is not quite as frightening as a horror movie, but somewhat like a twilight zone with an unexpected ending. I found this to be rather intriguing and it kept my attention better than most modern movies of today. There is something very elegant, contemplative and intriguing about the movies in Jean Cocteau's trilogy. I love the way the mirrors turn watery and how the characters move so easily from one world to the next.

7789762,5,0780023161,"Jean Cocteau's ""Orphee,"" along with his earlier ""La Belle et la Bete,"" must be ranked among the greatest of French films. This highly personal version of the myth of Orpheus remains a testament both to the the power of poetic imagery on film and to Cocteau's genius as a creator of such imagery. Cocteau's Orphee (Jean Marais) is a brusque, egocentric, dissatisfied soul who, to paraphrase Keats, is more than half in love with Death. As portrayed by Maria Casares, Death is far from the easeful presence Keats envisioned, but imperious, severe, and tres, tres chaud. Setting his fantasy in then-contemporary France (1949, to be exact), Cocteau dresses his angels of Death in leather and puts them on motorcycles, the roar of their engines as inexorable as a buzzsaw, and sends Orphee cryptic messages from the underworld via a car radio. ""Orphee"" is an unforgettable story of obsession and renunciation, the characters constantly going forward and backward through mirrors in a miasma of love, pain, and time lost and regained. Just as Orphee and Death act out their torrid passion, Eurydice (Marie Dea) carries on a sadder, more delicate version of the same story with Death's servant Heurtebise (Francois Perier). Meanwhile, the drunken poet Cegeste (Edouard Dermithe) finds himself a nearly mute witness to the drama, severed for eternity from the passions swirling around him. This three-disc set is worth owning for ""Orphee"" alone; the other two films are interesting, but not extraordinary. ""The Blood of a Poet"" (1930) feels like warmed-over Bunuel these days, while ""The Testament of Orpheus"" (1959), Cocteau's valedictory address to the cinema, is an intermittently interesting but overly talky apologia for Cocteau's life and career. They are interesting mainly for the light they shed on ""Orphee""; ""The Blood of a Poet"" contains many of the motifs found later in ""Orphee,"" especially Cocteau's fascination with mirrors, while ""The Testament of Orpheus"" brings back the lead actors from ""Orphee"" to serve as Cocteau's guides and artistic judges. (Cocteau, always a bit of a name-dropper, also brings in his pals Pablo Picasso and Yul Brynner for cameos.) The judgment is unavoidable: ""The Blood of a Poet"" proved that Cocteau needed a story on which to hang his images, while ""The Testament of Orpheus"" proved that he told a story better with images than with words. Among the many excellent technical credits is that of Georges Auric, surely one of the greatest of all film composers, who wrote the superb music for all three films. The first disc also contains a fascinating and informative documentary about Cocteau, in which he reminisces about Picasso, Nijinsky, Debussy, Satie, Diaghilev, and all the other great artists he knew. It was Diaghilev who exhorted Cocteau, ""Astonish me!"" Cocteau proceeded to astonish him and everyone else for the next fifty years. (In watching ""Orphee,"" it's also fun to play Cocteau's version of ""La Ronde""; he cast both his former lover, Jean Marais, and his current one, Edouard Dermithe, while simultaneously Marais was having an affair with Marie Dea. Only Michael Powell--having his former mistress Deborah Kerr and his current mistress Kathleen Byron fight to the death at the edge of a cliff in ""Black Narcissus""--was equally daring.)",1154131200,13,3290,5.174484052532833
7789763,3,0780023161,"Criterion's done a nice Criterion-quality job in assembling Jean Cocteau's 3 most famous films, but seeing them all together left me a little disappointed. In returning to the Orpheus myth three times over a thirty year span, Cocteau displayed an ongoing fascination with the artist as a chosen creature, attuned to a special realm of beauty that eludes the common run of humankind. To my mind though, these films are more concerned with revering the Poet than with being poetic. The special effects they rely on to convey the world on the other side of the mirror, the artist's domain of wonder and dreams, are awkward even for their time and struck me more as stagecraft than a real engagement with the subconscious as a creative force. Outside of the imagery, the films have little to offer in the way of narrative or acting or cinematographic wizardry. For surrealist filmmaking, Buster Keaton has Cocteau beat hands down.

Watching these films it occurred to me--and I'm sure I'll get a lot of negative votes for this!--that Cocteau was at heart a poseur. He recognized the genius in his famous friends and collaborators (Picasso, Stravinsky, Satie, Apollinaire) but when it came to expressing his own, relied on a canny restatement of the Romantic idea of the suffering artist, one that would play well to the public but had little to do with the radical new art burgeoning around him.  That may be too harsh, but I wonder if I'm alone in finding these movies a little too self-consciously poetic to be really moving.",1134259200,20,1523,4.831417624521073
7789764,5,0780023161,"If you are one of those people who still doubts the movie is far from being an artistic ecpression; come to Cocteu's world and please convince by yourself about the veracity of this affirmation.

Cocteau adapted the classic Orpheus's myth to the present times, but keeping the essential basis of the myth and its veil's mystery. The poetry literally loads the picture all along the way.

Blood of a poet constitutes undoubtedly, the first reference step you must ascend to higher peaks. The surrealist airs are present with all the frenzy of the First Opus; rapture images and seductive illusion, irreverence and disobey; a real captive journey through the Fourth Wall where the dreams and love live.

In Orpheus,we will assist to the dramatic premise: Orpheus is obsessed with his wife's death. Heuterbise and Cegeste will his fellows friends and his lamentations and complaints are at last satisfied when he will get the opportunity to get through the frontier between the life and death. She will visit to his beloved wife in clear reference to Dante and Beatrice but he will sign a pact with the underworld's Jury: he will return with his beloved wife with jus one condition: he won't be able to watch her under any pretext or reason.

To look behind: this is the most important reflection that feeds not only this fabulous myth but even an apparent far distant work as Faust: to look behind means to be frozen in the time's shadows; and Faust through the decision of becoming to the dead youth will establish his own agreement with Satan. But you have more: When Lot's wife in the Christian mythology looks behind becomes in salt's statue. The memories constitue a real matrix: it's seductive, the enviroment temperature is so warm and seductive that you can be engaged through your entire life. Narcisus comes to our mind when the human being, once has reached the experience's stage, pretendes, mistakenly, to get back to the ancestral origin: the naive innocence. If you decide to get back, you are committed to pay a prize, that's why Orpheus will be murdered in the Hades.

Finally in Orpheus' testament we assist to the last farewell of the poet. Inquired by the Great Jury Cocteau answers: ""A film is the petrified image of the mind which resurrects the dead acts"". He will be punished to live in his final days till the time will come for him to fade. The final encounter with Oediphus literally will invade you of perplexity and cosmic anguish; to be so close and unable to meet one each other.

Consider this film not only one of the twenty giants films one any age ever made but one of the ten top French films and perhaps one the three most admired and perfect film in the whole cinema's story. The other two to my mind would be: Carne 's Children of the paradise and Robert Bresson 's A man escapes.
