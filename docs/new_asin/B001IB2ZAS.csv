3646590,5,B001IB2ZAS,"I have been wanting to buy this voluminous tomb for a few years and finally bought it when it went on sale.  And what a buy this is.  Wow.

In the 29 hours this collection takes, there's so much information here that after listening to this one could probably pass a Colonial American History exam and pass with flying colors. There are 13 separate History Channel productions here in one collection, from the Founding Fathers and Founding Brothers, to The Revolution (alone an awesome, spell-binding work), Ben Franklin and The Crossing.  If you already own these sets separately, the price of this collection may not be worth it.

This compilation of 13 works produced through the History Channel/A&E collected into one 12-disc set accounts for some repetition and even a few contradictory comments about some of our Founding Fathers. (For more detailed reviews of these separately, just go to the respective DVD in question) Regardless, all throughout this set one gets the typical History Channel trademark reenactments, talking heads and dramatizations of these events.

My new personal favorite is ""The Founding Fathers.""  Here you hear about the excessive drinking, dubious characters, feuding personalities and unethical behavior of some of our Founding Fathers.  It's nice to hear the truth about some of these men without making them appear to be villains in disguise.

On a technical note, the set is nicely presented in a hard cardboard set.  Two discs per holder are folded inside this set.  It looks very nice on the bookshelf.

A perfect gift for the early American History fan.",1290470400,24,1593,5.061302681992337

3646592,4,B001IB2ZAS,"This is a worthwhile set to purchase with excellent info... some are done in a documentary style while others are actual films about the lives of these famous historical figures and events. A lot of information you would not learn in school.

However, after watching a few of the DVD's, you start to notice that the info has become repetitive. You start seeing scenes from previous DVD's and the same info recut over and over again. On many, 3/4ths of the info is repeated and recut from prior DVD's adding just a few extra minutes of new info to each section. Some of it gets so repetitious that you begin to question if you are watching the same DVD as before. Thus, the editing jobs are terrible and not sequentially done. So the same things keep getting redone by recutting the same footage. At least 4 DVD's are wasted duplication... but if you don't watch them, then you miss the 10% of new info included. I marked 4 stars because of this deliberate repetition of recutting the same scenes to create extra episodes. I guess they think no one would notice?

There are also contradictions between the DVD's. One says Washington was 6'4"" while another says he's 6'1"" while yet another says he's 6'3.5"" so it is evident that no one person was responsible for info continuity. One DVD on Washington was obviously written for the ego's of the authors of books on Washington who are doing the interviews and it leaves out his entire childhood.

However, the DVD on Benedict Arnold is exceptional. He is repeatedly mentioned throughout the DVD's, but one DVD is a movie of his life. I learned a lot of new things. I had been programmed to react to his name like everyone else... but I learned what caused him to do what he did and felt quite sorry for him after seeing the facts... which I did verify from other sources after seeing it on the DVD's. After watching how he was continuously crapped on after each heroic act he achieved in practically winning the war for our country... and how they refused to pay him; refused to reimburse him; a worthless General Gage stole his credit for the heroic battles he won: and how another corrupt leader in Philadelphia destroyed his reputation in the press because Arnold prevented his street executions... then this leader blackmailed Washington into backing him against Arnold by threatening to cut off all supplies to the military... then Arnold nearly losing his home, the death of his wife and the loss of his entire business because he had not been paid... while his promotions recommended by Washington (who adored him)... went ignored because Arnold did not have the bloodlines and had been indentured by his mother as a child... so he was constantly being spat on by the Congress for whom he was fighting these battles... Arnold was not one of the ""in crowd"" and was treated like rubbish no matter what great things he had done. You can see why this man did what he did. It was very sad. Worth watching. I had no idea he had been treated so poorly. It was a disgrace. If he had been treated with the respect and recognition he had earned, he would have never done what he did.

The DVD on Ben Franklin was also quite well done. There is quite a bit of info on him. I had no idea that he really lived all of his time in London and in France and very little in the US. Quite the womanizer too... but his quick wit made him quite popular.

The Crossing was another film in the set which was well done.

Again, the set is quite educational even with its flaws and repetition. It shows the good and bad of the building of a country and how each person was involved. The info on Samuel & John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton was also quite interesting to watch. How many people know that Former Presidents John Adams & Thomas Jefferson... although they did not speak for about 10 years after an ugly mudslinging presidential campaign... later became good friends in correspondence after their wives died with more than 150 letters sharing their love of literature... and both men ended up dying on the same date... which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence... July 4, 1826... John Adam's last words were, ""Jefferson survives"" but he did not know, Jefferson had died just a few hours earlier. An amazing coincidence. A shame our schools never teach these things.

Or that George Washington died from bad doctoring who after coming down with a cold, died because his doctors had ""bled"" over 5 pints of blood from him.

Just a personal observation which genealogists already know... but most people had been led to believe we have longer lives now and lifespans were shorter in the past. Just the opposite. Most of these famous men lived into their 80's and 90's (Franklin, Jefferson, Adam's, etc). A few in their 60's but the majority much older unless by war or other means. While people today are now dying in their 50's and early 60's by the droves. What they tell people and what is fact are two different things. Just read the obits and then compare the general ages on the records of the past to see for yourselves.

All in all... I definitely recommend this set of DVD's for the historic value and quality of presentation. The school systems don't teach these things so it is about the only venue for your family to learn about these events unless they like to read. The DVD's are enjoyable to watch and the actors performed their roles excellently. Even with the duplicated info and bad editing... the DVD's are still quality watching.",1269907200,79,5528,4.609756097560975
8310642,5,B001IB2ZAS,"This is a really great collection of documentaries about the American Revolution, aka War of Independence. I did not know much about the subject when I started, so for me these documentaries were just perfect.

Contents

This very impressive set consists of several separate and independent products.

The Founding for America, in 4 discs and 13 parts, tells the story of the war from beginning to end. It ends with the implementation of the Constitution and George Washington becoming the first President of the United States. I found it excellent, but the last two episodes, dedicated to George Washington, were a disappointment. They basically just selected parts of the previous 11 programs, focusing on Washington, and put them together. Parts 12 and 13 thus did not add a lot of value and I could not understand why they were made. Perhaps it was a way to sell two more episodes at little cost, since they just cut & pasted from the previous parts. This is my only criticism, as the series is really good.

The American Revolution, in 2 discs and 6 parts, has the same scope (the war from beginning to end).  Because it is shorter than the above, it obviously gives less detail, but also explores some aspects of the war not covered in The Founding of America.

The Founding Fathers and its sequel, the Founding Brothers, focus on Americas leaders (Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton, Payne, etc.). The Fathers tells the story of these men during the War of Independence. The Brothers follows their steps during the first years of the New Republic. Alongside their qualities, the series present their weaknesses. The Fathers comes in 2 disks and consists of 4 parts. The Brothers, also in two discs, is in 2 parts. The Brothers covers the presidencies of George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and ends with the dead of the latter two, after a long period of retirement. Both programmes are not a history of the United States during the period under study, but a documentary focusing on individuals.

Finally, the collection includes 4 stand alone disks:

- Washington The Warrior: 1.5 hour documentary detailing the military career of George Washington, from his service in the French and Indian War as a militia officer to his victory at Yorktown. The documentary does not cover his presidency.

- Ben Franklin: 1.5 hour documentary telling the life of this remarkable businessman, scientist and politician. As the programme says  All you knew about Ben Franklin is true, but there is much, much more about him. Affectionate and witty.

- Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor: Arnold might have been the worst traitor in American history, but he was pushed to defection by the shabby treatment his countrymen gave him. This DVD contains a 1.5 hour dramatization of the life of Benedict Arnold, starring Aidan Quinn. The extras contain a 45 minute documentary. Sympathetic to Arnold, both show an understanding of why he changed sides. Probably because he saved the revolution twice (one of them at Saratoga) and because his plan to surrender West Point to the British failed. Arnold is portrayed as a tragic, rather than an evil figure.

- The Crossing: This is a 1.5 hour dramatization of the crossing of the Delaware river in 1776 and the battle of Trenton. George Washington and his continental army surprised and captured a Hessian garrison, proving that the Americans could take on and defeat well trained European troops.

The programs are fair and even-handed

What stroke me the most was how even-handed and fair the collection was. True, there is great respect for the Founding Fathers and recognition of Americas achievements during the war, but alongside there is criticism and the British are treated fairly and with respect.
Here are a few things I retained from this great collection. I am, on purpose, focusing on the criticisms just to show how even-handed they are:

- The British expelled the French from North America in the Seven Years Wars (1756-1763), and from this point Canada became British. Although American militia took part in this war (including Washington), the main effort was imperial, and Britain paid for the war costs. By expelling the French, Britain removed the main reason why the American colonists needed her: defence from the French and their Indian allies. No more French colonies, no more need for imperial protection.

- The British attempted to tax the Americans to recover the costs of this war, which had greatly benefited the colonies. It was the taxation issue, leading to no taxation without representation, what to a large extent triggered the war. But the British request for taxation to pay for the Seven Years War was more than reasonable.

- The British tried to be accommodating and avoid a break. They kept abolishing the different taxes, and even as far as the battle of New York they tried to negotiate and avoid attack. Thus, they were not the tyrants depicted in Patriot propaganda.

- The Boston massacre was not a massacre. A mob attacked a British patrol, who fired in self defence. Who fired the first shot is not clear, but the patrol was certainly under attack. The number of casualties was low. In an action that is a credit to himself, John Adams, of impeccable Patriot credentials, agreed to defend the hapless British soldiers in order to secure a fair trial. It is a tribute to America that most were acquitted and the other two only received life sentences. The first man killed at the massacre (the first martyr of the revolution) was an African-American.

- At the time of the revolution, 20% of the population of the colonies was African American. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and others were southern gentlemen who owned plantations and many slaves. In spite of the principles of the Declaration of Independence (All men are created equal  etc, etc.) the Founding fathers did not abolish slavery. They postponed the issue, which was only solved in the Civil War one century later. The British, in an attempt to undermine the economy of the southern colonies, offered freedom to any black who would join their army, and many did.

- Jefferson, in spite of his owning slaves, had many negative things to say about the institution in his draft of the Declaration of Independence. The delegates of the continental Congress removed all of this, to his intense annoyance.

- For all practical purposes, therefore, the principles of the declaration of independence only applied to white men. References to slavery, as mentioned above, were removed  and it seems that nobody even thought of the native Americans  Indians were probably not men? What happened in the subsequent centuries of expansion to the Pacific speaks for itself.

- At the time of the Revolution, about half of the population just wanted to be left alone and was neither Patriot nor Loyalist. Of the other half, two thirds were Patriot sympathisers and one third was loyalist. Benjamin Franklins son, for example, remained loyal to Britain. The war forced everyone to take sides  and in the end many loyalists preferred to emigrate to Canada and settled in Ontario. Until then, Canadas European population had mainly been of French descent.

- George Washington pretended not to seek command of the Army  but always attended the Continental Congress wearing his uniform, which emphasized his experience in the French and Indian Wars. It is said that he lost more battles than he won, but this does not matter as in the end he won the war, which is what counts. His main achievement was not victories, but having created an army out of civilian volunteers with no military experience or training, and having kept it together. Americas devotion to him is more than justified. Washington, according to the documentary Washington The Warrior, knew that he did not have to win the war. He only had to avoid losing it, and this meant that his priority had to be to keep the army in being. The British, even if victorious in many engagements, would eventually lose the political will to continue a never-ending war.

- French military intervention on the side of the Americans proved decisive for the final victory, and Yorktown was a combined Franco-American victory. Spain also intervened on behalf of the colonies, although this is not mentioned as Madrids assistance was not decisive. Britains imperial adversaries thus combined with the colonies against London.

- Yorktown was an important victory, but the war continued and there were still enough undefeated British troops in North America to keep up the fight. However, Britain no longer had the political will and granted generous peace terms. It was better to make friends with the Americans, who were after all at this stage mainly descendants of British settlers, and ensure that profitable trade relations could be established. Diplomatic recognition happened with a formal peace treaty which brought the war to an end. In comparison, it took Spain decades to recognise the independence of her Latin American colonies.",1507420800,,9056,4.978145695364239
8310643,4,B001IB2ZAS,"Very well done with good historical accuracy and detail missing in other account. The only thing I objected to was one section by A&E on Benedict Arnold. Other parts of this series treat the account with accuracy and less personal details. If you want accuracy without superfluous coverage, skip that one and the first series Founding Fathers which delves into their personal lives and, in my opinion, was not up to the higher level of the Revolution series.
