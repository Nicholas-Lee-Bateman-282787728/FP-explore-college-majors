7996674,3,B0000ADXEH,"When the fight scenes in a boxing movie lack punch, as they do in SPLIT DECISION, it's the cinematic equivalent of a TKO.

This is the story of an Irish-American family from NYC's Hell's Kitchen. Patriarch Dan McGuinn (Hackman) is a retired boxer and son of a former pugilist (McLiam). His two boys have followed in the family trade. Ray (Fahey) is a small-time pro middleweight and the younger Eddie (Sheffer) a Golden Gloves winner with Olympic aspirations.

Ray is accidentally beat to death after he defies corrupt promoter Benny Pistone (Tolkan) and refuses to lay down against 'Snake' Pedroza (Velez). Eddie abandons any gold medal dreams for a chance to avenge his brother in the ring against Snake.

(Note: Jennifer Beals has a minor role here; she is not trying to save L.A. from destruction!)
