It gives guidelines on how to bet, how to manage your money so you don't run out before you are winning or ready to quit and how to play the best odds on the table.  If you want to have fun at the craps table, you should watch this DVD.",1358467200,,264,3.8703703703703702
8416512,3,B00455F6E6,"It was basically a 25 minute lecture. He doesn't even show you the ""system"" in action to convince you that it works.",1326844800,2,116,4.318181818181818
8416513,5,B00455F6E6,"It takes a lot of patience and self-control to completely change the way you've played a game (Craps) for years and years.  That being said, I took to heart what this system teaches and am now enjoying games for longer stretches of time, winning more frequently than losing and feel more comfortable with my decision making at the table.  This is an awesome tutorial and be warned - it will make your palms itch!!!",1288051200,2,414,4.581081081081081
8416514,5,B00455F6E6,"My girlfriend bought this for me a few weeks before I went to Las Vegas. I watched the DVD on the plane ride and picked up the strategy pretty quick. I was only in Vegas for 3 nights and the first night I did not gamble, but I did the second and third night. Both nights I came out on top. This strategy does not ALWAYS win, but if you're smart about when you walk away, you'll do fine. By the end of the trip I almost tripled my gambling money.

One tip for anyone who bought this DVD is to follow EVERY rule they give, because if you do not, I found out the hard way how the strategy will not work unless you do everything they tell you to.

Good luck, I hope this helps!",1287100800,2,673,3.9051094890510947
