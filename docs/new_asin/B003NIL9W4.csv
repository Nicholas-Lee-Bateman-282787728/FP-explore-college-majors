8401170,1,B003NIL9W4,"This might have been a good book, but as a TV series, it was terrible.  There are almost no sympathetic characters, and the story is so full of bad acting, weak plot lines, it was difficult to watch any episdoe without hitting FF.  If only there was an ""undo"" button on my purchase of this disk.",1449100800,,295,4.25
8401171,4,B003NIL9W4,"I was expecting a little more for my thirty dollars then one DVD, but apparently 3 hours, or 7 episodes is all there is. Still glad I got it. The series itself is fascinating. Too grim for children, British currency devalues, and with British money being worthless prices skyrocket and merchants hold back what produce they do have. The end result a lot of people grow more and more desperate for food, and animals crawl out of the woodwork. The main protagonists is an ex military man and his family. He predicts the crisis and has a cellar full of food at a time his when neighbors are going hungry. Though his goal of keeping his family fed is admirable, he's such an idiot about it it's hard to feel any sympathy for the guy. He makes his little girl get rid of their dog, then takes in the most loathsome creature I've ever encountered on television, a man in his seventies who tries to blackmail him into letting him sleep with his eighteen year old daughter. People find out about his food cellar and things go from bad to worse.

There's a lot of talk on the morality of hoarding food that's odd listening to today. At the time in Britain they felt it was very wrong. Sad thing is today in America he wouldn't have been noticed. Every Mormon family has a years supply stashed away, and don't expect them to share with you, unbeliever. Goldman and Sacks employees take swine flu vaccine from babies and nobody thinks twice about it. The time and place of this series is different and hard to relate to, but very interesting.",1291248000,4,1531,4.4678571428571425
