I have always been a huge fan of Steve Buscemi and try to buy any and every thing he is involved in, this film included and I am glad I own it. This is a strangle little tale that was and indie hit especially at Sundance. I have no idea why it took me so long to review this but I guess later is better than never. This really is a good yet quirky movie, really it is.

The film follows Les Galantine [Buscemi] a paparazzi even though he thinks he is better than that, and a young homeless actor wannabe named Toby Grace [Michael Pitt]. These two come together by chance when Les is waiting to get some shots of a singer/actress played by Alison Lohman. While waiting for her Toby literally runs into him and offers his services as an assistant, his first job is to go get him some coffee. On his way back he gets his first glance of the singer and falls in love. From a weird some what non trusting friendship builds between the two as Les lets Toby live with him if he works for free. As the story moves on we see one succeed in life while the other comes to terms with whom and what he truly is.

This is a crazy story full of betrayal and backstabbing and not just between the two lead characters. Writer/director Tom DiCillo did a wonderful job with this film particularly with the script. The story and characters are excellent and some of the most interesting I have seen in a while. And his direction is top notch showing us this film through his eyes, very interesting tale of life on the outside edge of the fast lane.

Steve Buscemi is brilliant as usual in this film and is nothing short of becoming this character named Les. He is a guy who try's to live like he is better than what he is, a paparazzi. He is also not the nicest guy as he takes complete advantage of Toby using him to get what ever he wants, like helping him sneak into parties and get pictures. Toby is played masterfully by Michael Pitt and is just a nice guy looking for some help but Les rubs off on him a little. Pitt actually may be the show stealer in this one but still I think Buscemi is the best. Alison Lohman is great as the singer who falls for Les but is just as lost as him even though she is successful. To be honest this is one of those films were even people in the back ground are great, just a good film over all.

This is a very interesting and entertaining film that I would recommend to any one reading this. I did not want to give much away but still I found it to be one of the better films I have seen recently. I mean come on Buscemi is in it, that should be enough for any one to want to see this movie.",1251331200,6,2622,4.093385214007782

3102941,3,B0013D8L7W,"Writer-director Tom DiCillo returns to the same sharply observed, navel-gazing territory he explored in his previous films ""The Real Blonde"" and ""Living in Oblivion"", namely, pointed meditations on the personal and artistic angst that performers (and all those who take succor from their celebrity) must suffer as they busily claw their way to fame and fortune.

DeCillo regular Steve Buscemi portrays the peevish Les Galantine, a bottom feeding paparazzi who fancies himself as the heir apparent to Richard Avedon. We are introduced to Les in a scene that strongly recalls Martin Scorcese's introduction of the desperate and needy autograph hounds in ""The King of Comedy""; a group of photographers hurl insults and elbows at each other as they jostle for position waiting for a glimpse of the ridiculously named K'Harma Leeds (Alison Lohman), a wispy pop diva. We observe as Les establishes himself as the alpha parasite, shoving his way to the front of the swarm.

Also on hand is an aspiring actor turned homeless bum named Toby Grace (oy, the names of these characters!) portrayed with wide-eyed, angelic, erm, grace by Michael Pitt. Quite by accident, Toby literally stumbles into affording Les the money shot of the diva as she steals out a side door. Toby subsequently ingratiates himself into an overnight stay on Les' couch, and, with the opportunistic instinct of a street person, proceeds to convince the initially suspicious photographer that he needs an ""assistant"" to help him get more of those page one tabloid photos (a job he will gladly fill in exchange for room and board).

To avoid spoilers, let's just say serendipity (and a tremendous suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer) eventually lands the homeless Toby into a plum role in a hot new TV series, and a star is born, greatly complicating his friendship with the now embittered and still-struggling Les, who feels Toby is ""his"" discovery (Pitt is basically reprising the same ""All About Eve"" type character he portrayed in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"".)

DiCillo isn't exactly breaking new ground either, but he executes it with his patented blend of darkly comic cynicism tempered by a vibe of magical realism; it is a uniquely identifiable style of modern fable-telling that has made me a fan of the director's work.

Buscemi is at his ""lovable weasel"" best here, and the strong supporting cast includes the always dependable indie stalwart Kevin Corrigan (Who?! If you saw him, you would say ""Oh yeah-THAT guy!"") and a surprisingly great turn from Gina Gershon, who displays a real flair for vicious comedy as a cutthroat agent (sort of a female version of Ari Gold from HBO's ""Entourage"".) Also look for Elvis Costello, playing himself in a hilarious cameo. I wouldn't call this DeCillo's best film (that would be ""Living in Oblivion"", with ""Box of Moonlight"" running a close second, IMHO), but fans of backstage tales will definitely get some jollies out of it.",1219881600,,2952,5.016326530612245

Everyone talks about Steve Buscemi, okay, he's great, but we've seen him a thousand times before. What about Michael Pitt? He has made some interesting choices in his career, and this character is no different. He does have a beautiful face, and that's what gets him where he arrives at the end of this movie. Is he a talented actor? You betcha. He is more talented that Steve Buscemi? That's a good question. Steve Buscemi is good at what he does, whether in indie films, acting and directing, or on ""The Sopranos"". Michael Pitt is always spectacular. He is someone to watch. He is riveting. I watched (and bought) this movie because Michael Pitt was in it. I am not disappointed.",1216684800,4,816,5.536

He's actually a scrounging bottom-feeder, a deluded dreamer who teaches Toby some of the tricks of his trade--everything from gate-crashing high- and low-end parties for the free buffet spreads to swiping goodie bags from glitzy premiers and media events.  Toby, however, turns out to be trustworthy, calm, sweet-natured and, most importantly, a very good looking young man who soon attracts the attentions of a casting agent (Gina Gershon) and, later still, a troubled starlet (Alison Lohman).  Pulled up from the bottom, Toby becomes a star, leaving a jealous, possessive and increasingly infuriated Les to stew in his own grungy, hand-to-mouth existence.  ""Delirious"" is ostensibly about the men's hard-bitten relationship.  But as written and directed by Tom DiCillo, this independently-made film is actually a very tart commentary on the symbiotic relationship between media-driven infatuation and the fishbowl of celebrity culture--although ""Delirious"" is less cynical and far less fatalistic than its prototype, ""Midnight Cowboy"" (the 1969 X-rated Oscar-winning movie which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in comparable roles).

3102994,5,B0013D8L7W,"Just saw this feature on MGM-HD channel. Never heard of it before. It is a laugh riot. But, someone says it is similar to MIDNIGHT COWBOY. That's strange to me. MIDNIGHT COWBOY was the first X-rated feature to win an Oscar for best picture. Today, it has been rated R.

Comparing that film with Delirious is like Jeeps to Cadillacs. Michael Pitts is no Jon Voight. There is no comparison. Pitts is a good actor as well as Buscemi. Buscemi is the reason I watched this feature. And he does a good job, as he has in all of his film history. This is a low budget B type of film. But, it is one of the best of this genre. I am purchasing it for my collection. It is total camp and goes beyond rental. It's a collectible.

MIDNIGHT COWBOY had a leading director and a budget that fitted the story. It is still one of my top 5 movies. Don't compare an Oscar winner to a B film. Delirious, like I say, is entertaining, funny, and for me a collectible. It's a picture for group viewing with perhaps, a joint in their hand-smile! MIDNIGHT COWBOY is the film that started Voight's career. Nobody, other than him, could do the role so convincingly. Voight was ""eye"" candy. Michael Pitts isn't, at least in this film. But, he is a good actor. He should have smiled more.",1268524800,,1258,4.30379746835443

3337491,5,B0013D8L7W,"Just saw this feature on MGM-HD channel. Never heard of it before. It is a laugh riot. But, someone says it is similar to MIDNIGHT COWBOY. That's strange to me. MIDNIGHT COWBOY was the first X-rated feature to win an Oscar for best picture. Today, it has been rated R.

Comparing that film with Delirious is like Jeeps to Cadillacs. Michael Pitts is no Jon Voight. There is no comparison. Pitts is a good actor as well as Buscemi. Buscemi is the reason I watched this feature. And he does a good job, as he has in all of his film history. This is a low budget B type of film. But, it is one of the best of this genre. I am purchasing it for my collection. It is total camp and goes beyond rental. It's a collectible.

MIDNIGHT COWBOY had a leading director and a budget that fitted the story. It is still one of my top 5 movies. Don't compare an Oscar winner to a B film. Delirious, like I say, is entertaining, funny, and for me a collectible. It's a picture for group viewing with perhaps, a joint in their hand-smile! MIDNIGHT COWBOY is the film that started Voight's career. Nobody, other than him, could do the role so convincingly. Voight was ""eye"" candy. Michael Pitts isn't, at least in this film. But, he is a good actor. He should have smiled more.",1268524800,,1258,4.30379746835443

8249837,3,B0013D8L7W,Its a romance/drama and there wasn't even a chuckle here during the first 30-minutes. We were close to hitting the back button but it picked up a bit when some new characters were introduced but Steve Buscemi is an acquired taste that Ive never really acquired so thats always hard to overcome. Its a typical love story with a happy ending and some minor laughs in the later part of it but it does run too long and could have used some editing but there are worse movies than this to kill an hour and forty six minutes but don't expect much in the first half hour.,1516492800,,564,4.280373831775701

8249841,4,B0013D8L7W,"I like these two actors together,  Refreshing to see Steve plays just as big an a$$ in this show as he was in Boardwalk Empire.  I feel for Buscemi's character at the end when he is contemplating homicide.  If  you watch the credits, there is an extra scene that follows.",1498348800,,271,4.36
8249842,5,B0013D8L7W,"Beautiful. Surprisingly human story that I assumed would be one more paparazzi B.S .movie. But all stars were beautifully nuanced in their portrayals of their characters down to the one-line characters. No detail was missed. Steve, who is so good at crass that I pause before seeing his films, was beautiful and showed emotion in a wonderful way...understated for him. It made it real...an emotion I assumed he had trouble with...on the mark!",1491696000,2,442,5.068493150684931

8249846,5,B0013D8L7W,"Squeezed between utter cinematic nonsense (like the hundreds of episodes of ""annoying orange that Amazon is mindlessly promoting) is this hidden gem of a movie. It is a study on an evolving relationship between Steve Buscemi as the struggling paparazzo, (the word was coined by Fellini in the 1960 classic, La Dolce Vita--paparazzi is the plural form) and Michael Pitt as the homeless guy trying to make it big in the movies. What gives this film its power are the layered, shifting grounds of their complicated relationship given special strength by the two memorable performances by Buscemi and Pitt. Definitely worth watching. 4 3/4 stars.",1485993600,4,642,5.123809523809523
