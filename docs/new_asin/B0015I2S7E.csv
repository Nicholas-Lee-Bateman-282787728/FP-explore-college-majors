3145306,5,B0015I2S7E,"The unforgettable court room entrance of Alexis Carrington in the previous season inevitably altered not only the already complex dynamics of the beleagured Carringtons but for better and worse the series' plotting and pace. This season ups the ante with nearly every episode having at least one jaw dropping moment - from the abduction of Fallon's baby climaxing on a roof over Denver all the way to (season 3 volume 2) the burning cabin season finale. This season provides many pivotal moments: Alexis gradually assumes the shoulder padded mantle of powerful businesswoman, yet another lost Carrington heir pops up to cause more trouble, Fallon opens La Mirage with a jazz age party Fitzgerald would've killed to attend, Jeff is poisoned by paint fumes, Steven returns with a reconstructed mug and a smidgen less antagonistic attitude, Kirby does Sabrina with disastrous results. And let's not forget the brawl in the lilly pond! Some scenes are positively operatic: when Cecil Colby has a fatal heart attack with Alexis standing by his hospital bedside in bridal white (!) - the score plays strings each time they try to defibrillate him and crescendos when he flatlines, closing with a distraught Alexis bowed head weeping behind white veil - ah, good times that! - Maria Callas as Lucia di Lamermoor couldn't have done any better. Kidding. Arguably the other primetime serials were better written or had more fleshed out characterizations - yet none of them compares to the stylized histrionics of Denver's first family. With liberal paraphrasing of a quote from our favorite villainess: After Alexis throws a party, all the world will know it's been done.",1205193600,12,1661,5.110294117647059

3145318,4,B0015I2S7E,"I loved this 1982-83 Season when ABC had moved it to 9PM right after THE FALL GUY at 8PM as this soap opera drama continued to progress, but I don't see why Paramount saw a need to divide DYNASTY'S 3rd Season into 2 DVD volume sets since its such a waste of money, time, and space.

DYNASTY was a prime-time soap opera that aired on ABC from 1981-89 regarding a bunch of rich people humping each other who had the best lifestyles, the best houses, the best cars, the best looking women, the best parties, etc. that made a lot of people, including myself wanting to live like them, especially like Blake Carrington(John Forsythe)and Krystle Carrington(Linda Evans)who had frequent catfights with Blake's scheming ex-wife Alexis Carrington(Joan Collins)who was often either rolling on the floor with Krystle or rolling in the sheets with Blake's rivals.

It was also interesting having Pamela Sue Martin from THE HARDY BOYS co-starring on this show as well as Heather Locklear portraying Krystle's sleazy niece(Sammy Jo Dean)in this 1982-1983 Season too.

It's just too bad that DYNASTY couldn't last as long as DALLAS and that its ratings weren't as strong either since DALLAS was already in its 11th Season on CBS when ABC cancelled DYNASTY in the Spring of 1989, due to toppling ratings.",1345507200,,1288,4.89908256880734

3145322,4,B0015I2S7E,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

The third season opens with Blake (John Forsythe) lying unconcious on the edge of the cliff, after a fight with Dr. Nick Toscanni.  That will be the least of Blake's problems in this year!  When Alexis (Joan Collins) manages to drag up Krystle's ex-husband Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott), it's revealed that their Mexican divorce might not have been legal!  And as for Alexis, she marries Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) in the hospital after his near-fatal heart attack, and soon finds herself with ColbyCo. in her lap when Cecil kicks the bucket altogether.

The search for Blake Junior escalates, when ""Crazy Claudia"" (Pamela Bellwood) is seen clutching what appears to be the baby on the roof of a seedy hotel.  Alexis has a steamy affair with Mark; and Krystle (Linda Evans) once again gets on rocky ground with Blake when he discovers the amount of time that she seems to be spending with her ex.

Prodigal son Steven is involved in an oil-rig explosion near Singapore and returns to Denver with the face of Jack Coleman (original ""Steven"" Al Corley left the show at the end of the second year after becoming disillusioned by the scriptwriters).  And the long-lost first son of Blake and Alexis, Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson) appears literally out of the blue to claim his share of the family business - and soon has everyone offside!

Poor Jeff (John James) is driven out of his gourd by toxic paint fumes in his new ColbyCo. office; and Kirby (Kathleen Beller), Joseph's lovely daughter, makes her ""Sabrina""-esque entrance after returning from a long stay in Europe--and quicky sets about landing Jeff!

This set includes the first 12 episodes from the third season:

Disc 1: The Plea / The Roof / The Wedding / The Will
Disc 2: The Siblings / Mark / Kirby / La Mirage
Disc 3: Acapulco / The Locket / The Search / Samantha",1277510400,,2223,4.851851851851852
3145323,1,B0015I2S7E,"As a teenager I was a huge fan of Dynasty in the second half of its 9 year run, from the mid to late '80s. However, I missed out on seeing the early seasons, and was always keen to see them, as I really used to like this show. So, after all these years, I keenly awaited the DVD releases to revisit a show I remembered fondly from over 20 years ago.
What a disappointment! The show has dated badly and was nowhere near as enjoyable as I remember it. While Season 2 had its moments, Season 3 was pretty poor. The storylines in this season became too over-the-top, sensational and hard to believe. I know the show is only a soap, and was meant to be larger than life escapism and not to be taken too seriously, but I actually found I couldn't take it seriously at all. I can go along with sensational storylines to a point, but if plots don't have some logical explanation, with some vaguely realistic reactions and dialogue from characters, and don't make some attempt to be based in the real world- even a little- then I lose interest.
The dialogue here is always dramatic and grand, and not very believable: scenes are either sentimental with characters professing their love for each other, or characters fighting, feuding and plotting. There are few in-betweens, and little mature character interaction.
The character of Adam Carrington is farcical: kidnapped at birth and raised by his kidnapper on a remote farm, he grows up to be a suave, intelligent and well-groomed lawyer who returns to the family and is accepted into it within a few episodes, with little proof of his identity (a baby's rattle!).  A few episodes later, having just joined this multi-millionaire oil dynasty, he plots to murder his new brother-in-law - for little apparent reason- by painting his office with poisonous paint (the poison ends up making its victim aggressive for several episodes).
Plots are not logically worked out, they are just melodramatic and move too fast. Characters are thrown from one crisis to another, no matter how ludicrous, with each crisis being forgotten a few episodes later with no real lasting impact.
Chararacters are two dimensional, and are given little motivation for why they do the things they do: they do it either because they are ""good"" (like Krystle) or ""evil"" (like Adam.). Fallon Carrington's character is watered down this season, and has unfortunately lost its bite. The butler Joseph barely gets one dimension - he's just bland (or maybe it's just the actor playing him).
The show does have its good points, however -it must have done something right to be so popular back then. One of TV's greatest intro's and theme tunes, and John Forsythe, Linda Evans, Joan Collins and Pamela Sue Martin, who are fine actors and great to watch, and who have a good chemistry with each other. And it does have its fun moments, such as Krystle and Alexis' famous pond fight. And it also captures the greed, excess, fashion and conservativeness of the `80s well. But that's about it. If you want to watch a good `80s drama about an oil-rich feuding family, with better plots, more believable stories, and well-developed characters, buy Dallas instead.",1270771200,,3163,4.782449725776965
3145324,3,B0015I2S7E,"Although the .... ummmm .... colorful young men who still swoon over DYNASTY tend to insist it was all ""perfect"" (except for that nasty Season 1 which was too smart and character-based and sequin-deficient to really work for them), Season 3 is where the seeds for DYNASTY's downfall were originally sewn.

Season 1, as I said, was a well-crafted drama (with a legitimate sociopolitical subtext!) although a bit too leisurely-paced, perhaps. And Krystle was still a three-dimensional character. Then, in Season 2, Joan Collins enters the picture as mysterious ex-wife Alexis living in the art studio three feet from the house, which was splashy, cleverly-conceived and well-played fun.

So imagine my shock and disappointment when Season 3 premiered and all of that was .... gone.

Suddenly, the producers had changed the tone of their burgeoning hit show, contriving a misguided, furiously-adhered-to (for six years!) static acting directive designed to make the already-poised actors seem even MORE poised (yet did the opposite) while any narrative logic in the scripts was thrown out the window, hyperbolic love/hate repartee substituting for any kind of focus or flow to the stories... At once, all the characters became equidistant from one another, knew each other equally well, spoke in interchangeable dialogue. Gone was any warranted cynicism about wealth and the wealthy, replaced with a dreadful, fawningly '80s ""rich-people-are-good/poor-people-are-horrible"" mindset. And every corner of the show is now infected.

Yes, the introduction of snarling, long-lost son Adam (well-cast with Gordon Thomson) and his vaguely incestuous relationship with mother Alexis was a good thing, and the defining storyline of the season. But even that is lessened by the fact that Alexis has been transformed overnight from the grasping and manipulative socialite she was the previous season to brilliant Empress of Industry, with no transition period shown at all. Now that she is the just-add-water Queen of the Planet, she no longer has to purr and scheme and deceive; she simply openly insults and bitches everybody out in every scene, removing the sense of intelligence and mystery she once displayed and, likewise, any sense of her enigmatic backstory. She's just a spoiled cow now. Only a cow dressed in fur.

But the biggest loss is what happens to Krystle, the golden heroine once so soulfully played by Linda Evans. Krystle had at one time provided the moral voice for this show now so contemptuous of such perspective. With the downturn in the writing in season 3, the actors' simultaneously being restrained into excessive physical rigidity, and the loss of the producers' interest in anything not reflective of Reagan's smugly mercenary value system, Krystle quickly becomes a vapid and saccharine Stepford wife and exactly the goody-goody Alexis had always (and once unjustly) accused her of. And Evans' performance suffers pointedly: her clear-eyed countenance now increasingly replaced with a cross-eyed squealing of her lines (thank goodness the new producers from Season 9 finally acknowledged this change, cleverly chalking it up to a brain injury from years before!)... Just as Vivien Leigh was born to play Scarlett O'Hara, Linda Evans and Joan Collins seemed born to play Krystle and Alexis (as Season 2 gives most vivid evidence). They were PERFECT casting. Yet as the Good Queen is neglected and trivialized in Season 3 and beyond, the Bad Queen also suffers: Alexis no longer has a valid, statured, female partner with whom to spar.

These problems continued -- and were exacerbated -- for years. All the way thru Season 8... Star appeal and middling glitz and the program's obvious potential and a formidable Spelling/ABC public relations campaign kept the show in the press and high in the ratings for a few more seasons, the poorly-resolved Moldavian Massacre early in Season 6 often cited for its eventual collapse. But this briefly-great show was REALLY killed once bleating Krystle pulled Blake off that rainy mountainside at the outset of Season 3, Blake moaning in soapy splendor, ""Krystle, I must get home!""

Oh, what might have been.",1249257600,5,4161,5.27643504531722

3145330,5,B0015I2S7E,"I know there has been much controversy surrounding how Paramount is splitting the ""Dynasty"" DVD's into two volumes, but my attitude is that at least the studio is releasing them! I know it's more money for the consumer, but look at the shoddy way Fox released the first season of ""Dynasty""; they released it and no other releases became available. Also, if we boycott Paramount's releases of ""Dynasty"" we risk the fact that the studio will pull any future releases and we die-hard fans don't want that to happen.
 I have already purchased both volumes of ""Dynasty Season 3"" and Paramount has done another great job with the boxsets. The shows are picture perfect with wonderful audio and the shows themselves look like they were filmed yesterday. I also like the packaging of the dicks too.
  ""Dynasty"" became the 5th highest rated show on network TV in the 1983-84 season and it was because of the great writing and acting of the cast. Joan Collins continued to be the great villin everyone loved even surpassing Larry Hagman's J.R., and there were some wonderful cast additions like hunk Geofrey Scott who played Krystal's ex-husband Mark Jennings, who became involved with both Fallon and Alexis!. The biggest addition is Gordon Thompson, fresh from his role on ""Ryan's Hope"", who arrives in Denver as Adam, Blake and Alexis' long-lost son kidnapped at birth. Adam became the male antagonist everyone loved to hate, even going so far as poisining Jeff and raping a girl. There's also a new Steven, Jake Coleman from ""Days of our Lives"". Although not my favorite Steven, Coleman eventually makes Steven his own. Heather Locklear also returns in a few episodes as Sammy Jo, playing the tramp to perfection.
 This boxset contains the first 12 shows and ends with Sammy Jo arriving with a baby in tow at the Carrington mansion. ""Dynasty"" will always be the best primetime serial ever!",1236816000,2,1883,4.875
3145331,1,B0015I2S7E,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of criticism against CBS/Paramount for the way they are handling the distribution of the ABC primetime soap ""Dynasty"".  Fox was able to release the first season complete; and CBS/Paramount did the same for season two, so why the change over to volumes?  The only answer has to be old fashioned greed.

The reason I say greed is because this volume contains 12 episodes, yet costs just as much as the entire second season, which had 22. (You can even get the first two seasons for less than $10.00 more than this first half of season three.)

To be clear, this is the reason for my opposition to purchasing this set: the price.  I'm not really concerned about splitting the season into two, but the fact that CBS/Paramount is trying to peddle half a season at a full season price is where I draw the line.  If this was priced at say $17.00 to $19.00, people may not be so hostile to purchasing the set, because the price would be more in line with what is being offered (12 episodes vs. 22).

Finally, the other critique with seasons released in two volumes, it will take longer to complete all nine seasons.  CBS/Paramount can have two releases a year, but only put out one season.  If CBS/Paramount does indeed finish the ""Dynasty"" series, it will likely take longer to get 9 seasons of that series than it took Warner Bros. to release 14 seasons of ""Dallas"" (including the TV Movies release).

P.S. All this talk about criticism damaging future releases hasn't come true - CBS/Paramount will release Season 4 Vol. 1 in April.",1233100800,2,1561,4.562724014336918
3145332,1,B0015I2S7E,I refuse to buy this as when you buy a drama series you expect to see the season ending in the one boxset and not have to fork out the same money for half as much. Paramount don't care (its all about the money of course) as they are now releasing Melrose Place Season 5 Volume 1. What a load of @#%$...Go to hell Paramount....Everyone boycott them and don't buy anything off them!!!!,1232582400,,383,4.260273972602739
3145333,3,B0015I2S7E,"Yes, splitting the seasons is annoying.  But if its the only way to get the show released on DVD, then we have to deal with it. The low sales of season 1 caused years of delay before Season 2 was released.  And with these specialty audience sets that aren't as popular, retailers don't like to stock $60 items that will go unbought and collect dust on their shelves.

Dynasty isn't the first show to have split seasons, won't be the last.  All this buying it used talk will only serve to ensure seasons 4-9 don't get a release if the studios don't make a profit off these sets.",1231027200,,577,4.314814814814815
3145334,4,B0015I2S7E,"Is this release worth purchasing? Yes. As commented on in many reviews, the main flaw, and part of the reason this isn't a five-star product, is Paramount's decision to begin breaking the DVD release of shows like ""Dynasty"" down into separate volumes and then proceeding to charge the price of what one entire season used to sell for. For a fan of the show, it's disappointing to have to wait months, and then having to shell out more money, for one entire season of the show.  Another flaw with this release is that even at the hefty price (especially since it seems to have been a limited-time release and hard to find) there are no extra features! All you're getting with this release is indeed 12 episodes. Now, don't worry, there is some good.

""Dynasty"" season 3 is just as good as the previous seasons plot-wise. This is quality t.v. and the era of ""Dynasty"" before the outlandish, stereotypical 'soap' plots. If you're looking for a good drama with actors who can actually act and make you forget you're watching a prime-time soap, this show and release is for you. Season 3 continues the plots began in Season 2 with Alexis (Joan Collins) stirring up trouble for Blake (John Forsythe) by entering into the oil business ring. After dealing with Krystle's past in earlier seasons (Linda Evans) always dogging her current marriage, yet another past lover shows up - her ex-husband who brings news that rattles Krystle and Blake's now solid relationship. Steven's gone missing, another Carrington son has now shown up at Blake's doorstep, Fallon and Jeff are still on the outs and the set ends with the return of Sammy Jo and yet another new addition to the Carrington clan. With all this drama, it was nice to see the character being challenged and pushed emotionally and nothing really felt sensational or 'unbelievable' as in the later season. Each episode ends with some sort of cliffhanger to keep you coming back for more, including the final episode of the 3-disc set.

Quality wise, the transfer to DVD, as seen in the previous release, was great. The colors are vibrant, the sound is wonderful. The only thing that really holds this set back is the fact that it's incomplete and you have to dish out another twenty- or thirty-some dollars to complete it. That and the fact that there are absolutely no extra features, even with there having been a ""Dynasty"" cast reunion with interviews shot a few years ago that aired on ABC, Paramount still makes no effort to beef up the release, leaving the audience with just episodes, half a season, to feast on. Besides that, this was truly great television and it is nice to see it getting the DVD treatment, even if it is slow and now prolonged with split season releases. Definitely worth buying, even with it being a truncated release.",1229817600,,2793,4.731006160164271
3145335,4,B0015I2S7E,"It is unfortunate that the decision was made to split the seasons. The only reason is to charge more for the DVD sets. However even with this annoying sales pitch Dynasty is still a winner. I was a fan from the begining because of Steven's character being gay, when he went off after season two to find himself and work on an oil rig (oh, really gay proffession? go figure) I kind of went off Dynasty and hence missed most of this season. I am very pleased to be able to catch up on how Adam turned up, how he poisoned Jeff, how Kirby came back home and where La Mirage came from.

There are quite a few set ups in the first part of this season and a few story arcs that are constanly referred to in later seasons. It is nice to understand the whole back story to these. Krystal and Alexis are as always resplendant in the clothes they wear. Krystle's hair was never practicle. Unlike Alexis' who changed her style often. I must admit I had to laugh at the whole wedding in the hospital thing, could Cecil be that dumb. You could nearly see Alexis salivating at the idea of controling a company big enough to beat Blake at his own game.

Sammy Jo comes out of the wood work with a baby she claims to be Steven's. Steven is seen in shadow working on an oil rig as he was destined to get blown up and as Al Corley bowed out of he role to be replaced with a very young Jack Coleman who turned up years later in Heroes as Noah Bennett.

And speaking of youth. It's interesting to see Heather Locklear prior to her Melrose Place days. It is obvious her acting talent improved and she lost that small town annoying voice of hers. So I can't wait till part two arives in a few days so I can see how the new Steven is revealed, how Adam gets away with trying to kill Jeff, who Kirby sleeps with first, Jeff or Adam, and whats in store for Blake and Krystle.

3145339,4,B0015I2S7E,"This was a great first half season, sucks it was split up like that, but not shocking... seems everyone is trying to make a buck nowawdays with our crappy economy huh! As for the actual first half, I loved it as I knew I would.

The basis of this first half is all about Adam coming into the picture. I was shocked how poorly his arrival was written in. There was NO suspense whatsoever, it was like he found out he was a Carrington and in an episode or two he was working with Alexis at Colby Co. I was hoping for a more dramatic entrance, and whatever happened to the DNA test, I know those existed back then and its not like Blake couldn't afford it! Not really realistically written if you ask me. Still Adam is a chilling character, he definitely would play the perfect ""Cain"" to any ""Abel"" with those evil looking glares. Him raping Kirby was so cold but what made it odd was her reactiom after it was done. Kind of similar to when Blake raped Crystal in season 1.

Alexis manages to find Crystal's husband who Crystal thinks is her ex husband. Nothing really turns out like Alexis would have hoped and the way the first half ended looks like Alexis and Crystal's ex will be getting it on, that is of course after Falon already had a taste! I guess a foreshadow of what would come with Alexis' other daughter Amanda!

The first half ends with Steven's supposed death which we all know isn't a fact but still great drama as Blake becomes a madman to find his boy. Falon actually becomes human to Crystal and befriends her and of course Sammy Jo or as she likes to be called Samantha is back with Steven's supposed child and Heather doesn't dissapoint in the bitch department at all lol.

3145340,3,B0015I2S7E,"I originally started buying shows like Dallas and Dynasty because my parents watched them when I was a kid, so I am seeing them for the first time.  From the price point, paying $30 for twelve episodes of a show that is almost as old as I am, I am conflicted about buying Dynasty at all.  It has its fun moments, but its essentially a brand-x Dallas.
THE BAD:  Blake Carrington, who can never decide whether he's the benevolent patriarch or a J.R. Ewing-esque plotter, gets caught by surprise too often to be believable.  Jeff is bland, Fallon is whiny and spoiled, Claudia is superfluous, and the writers never seemed to decide whether Steven was gay or straight.  As for the storylines, Adam's introduction was abrupt and strained credulity and the abduction of little Blake eachoed little John's abduction on Dallas too closely.
THE GOOD:  Alexis Carrington Colby is perfect as the unapologetically nasty diva, and I'm sure more great moments would have been ahead. Adam's slowly driving Jeff crazy with psychoactive paint in his office was classic.
Now, I enjoyed season two as it wound on and the storylines got more involved, so perhaps if the entire season had been released at once I would have enjoyed it more.  Dallas, too, often took most of a season to really get addictive.  If Dynasty cost less, I would recommend it for a lark.  All I can say is that the studios have to realize that these older shows are not in that much demand and are becoming more and more dated, so maybe they should use a lower price point to sell them.",1215561600,4,1541,4.615384615384615

So of course the show is priceless.

I give this DVD two stars because the packaging is WASTEFUL.  Because season 3 comes in two DVD sets, this season will use twice the packing materials, twice the delivery cost, shelf space, etc. as it should.  What a waste.  Plus splitting one season into two volumes is weird and unusual -  I have never seen another TV show treated in this manner.

I have no problem with a higher price being charged for Season 3 than Seasons 1 or 2.  The first two seasons were quite a deal.  If too much is being charged, then customers will not buy the season, but somehow I doubt that is the case.

Maybe Season 4 will be available in less wasteful packaging regardless of the price.  Until then enjoy Season 3 Volumes One and Two if you choose to purchase them.",1214870400,6,1100,4.407960199004975

On Amazon, Season 2 is about $7 more than this particular set. Who knows why the powers-that-be chose to release this season in a split set...greed, economics, who knows...and no point arguing it here. What I do know is that the visuals on this particular set are fantastic. Color, clarity, resolution...it truly looks wonderful, as if it were filmed yesterday...except for the decidedly 1980's Nolan Miller fashions and over-the-top drama! The other thing I know is that this particular set has no extras; nada, zip, zero, zilcho, other than a few previews of other DVD's available. This is almost as big a sin as splitting the season in half.

Storyline, plenty happens in Season 3; this show had already hit its stride in Season 2 and fans were treated to exactly what they wanted: the strong bond of love between Krystal Carrington (Linda Evans) and her husband wealthy Denver tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe); plenty of plot-stirring hyjinks by Blake's ex-wife Alexis (Joan Collins) who uses anything to get back at Blake, including a son who was kidnapped at birth (Adam Carrington) and the first not-so-ex husband of Krystal, hunky tennis-pro Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott). Confused? Hang on, there are even more characters that get thrown into the pot this season: Krystal's scheming niece, Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear), who shows up just in time during the episode 12 to claim her ""late"" husband Steven Carrington's inheritance; Kirby (Kathleen Beller), the daughter of Blake's trusted servant Joseph, who stirs the hearts of Adam Carrington & Fallon's husband Jeff...oh yeah, he's also the guy who is being driven crazy by Adam because Adam doesn't want to share Colby Co., Alexis' company that she acquired through a quickie marriage in a hospital...damn, how confusing! Just get the series and it will all make sense (other than the oft-married Alexis wearing white and a veil to her umpteenth wedding held next to an oxygen tent - has she no shame?!?). You won't want to miss the drama, the fashion, the catfights, and the absolutely silly antics of the rich and famous of the 1980's.

For the episodes and quality of the transfer, I give this set a 5 star rating; for splitting the season in half and having no extras, I give it a 2 star rating; overall, I'll render a verdict of 3 stars and leave it up to you whether you want to buy it new, used, or wait until Bluray may bring out a whole nex product.",1214006400,15,2550,4.806378132118451

Paramount has us over a barrel here.  If we boycott this, they may not release Volume Two or future seasons.  If we do buy it, it will ensure they keep up these same greedy tactics.  I went ahead and bought it because I need to see what happens next.  I am not disappointed, but am annoyed that I spent the same on a half season that I did the previous full ones.  There's a recession going on, consumer confidence is down so we are asked to spend more.

What's really galling is that other shows get the Volume One treatment.  But those are shows like ""The Love Boat"" and ""Love American Style.""  Who cares how many volumes they're sold in: they're not serialized dramas.  No, this Volume One and Two tactic is cruel and unnecessary.

That said, Season Three continues right where we left off.  Adam Carrington is introduced and this creates a nifty backdoor for the writers that can explain away Blake's behavior in season one; so that's why Blake was such a jerk.  It's a clever move and also gives the show its reigning male villain in Adam.  Plus, this volume also features the classic ""Claudia on the rooftop"" scenario that is heartbreaking and nailbiting.

Dynasty is a wonderful tv drama that lasted 9 years and provided some of the best entertainment for the decade. The classic fight scenes between Alexis and Krystal are worth the price of the set alone!  The show is classic camp and Joan Collins really made the show.  The first season was ok but it really took off after Joan arrived.  I remember every Wednesday night watching this show and was so upset when the spin-off The Colbys was placed opposite Knots Landing.  I hope they bring that show out on DVD as well because some key characters were on each show.

With the price of tv shows on DVD, this isn't that bad of a deal even if you have to buy it in two installments.  Some shows are $90 for a season (CSI and most cable shows), so if I have to pay $50 for a season of Dynasty, I'll do it and it's easier on my wallet to do that in two different installments!  I'll enjoy this show for many years to come.  My complaint is that it has taken too long to enjoy this wonderful show on DVD and I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of Falcon Crest!  I mean, there are so many shows on DVD that did not live as long as Dynasty and were (in my opinion) not as good as Dynasty and they are already on DVD.

Yes, utter nonsense most of the time, but really fun nonetheless. Dynasty was a colorful and over the top extravaganza that kept us coming back for more drama and fashion and fights.
I have enjoyed a lot of TV in my life, from Northern Exposure and Upstairs Downstairs to Seinfeld and Green Acres. Dynasty remains a pleasure no matter how ridiculous it seems. The plots were zany, to be honest. But the show is just a hoot, plain and simple.

That being said, I am outraged that Season 3 (and possibly future seasons) is going to be divided up into volumes instead of complete seasons.

I totally understand the whole ""let's make mega millions profit at the expense of the T.V. fan thing"", but for this very annoyed T.V. fan; I will be taking the advice of a previous post and buying this item second hand, or maybe wait for the inevitable sale price and pick up the item at a price which will surely ensure the studio makes very little (if any) profit from my purchase.

I am afraid that if the studio persists in this ridiculous splitting up of season sets, they will only be shooting themselves in the foot as all the T.V on DVD fans I have spoken to don't like this split format and do not intend to support it.",1207958400,11,1082,4.454545454545454

I recently read a post where someone had mentioned the idea of buying used. That way they lose sales as they deserve to do for being so blatently greedy. That's what i had decided to do when manufacturers come out with split seasons.

 You can find them used, a little while after the are released from a reputable seller on Amazon or ebay. Don't keep the greedy corporate big-wigs living in houses similar to the Carrington estate. You are shelling out extra money in hard times for a show you love while the ""powers that be"" are probably hiring more servants to wait on them in their mansions.

Lets see, Dynasty Season 2 has 22 episodes and how many will this one have for the same Price?  12?  And we get to now wait AGAIN so we can essentially pay double the price to buy the rest of the season?  Is this a really bad joke?  Will they bother releasing Volume 2 when the sales for this release plummet?  Sadly, Only true, loyal fans willing to be held hostage and pay anything will accept what they dole out at any price.  Me?  I'll probably be one of them when I know I shouldn't.

And in the end, the studio will blame poor sales when they cancel any future releases and the Dynasty series dies.

Maybe they can release ""The Colbys"" on VHS and charge more for the much larger packaging.

In some insane way, I'd be less aggravated if they released the entire Season 3 for a much higher price of about $60.  But simply splitting it into two and making us WAIT as if we can't do the math of double charging us?  Purely insulting.

3379803,5,B0015I2S7E,"The unforgettable court room entrance of Alexis Carrington in the previous season inevitably altered not only the already complex dynamics of the beleagured Carringtons but for better and worse the series' plotting and pace. This season ups the ante with nearly every episode having at least one jaw dropping moment - from the abduction of Fallon's baby climaxing on a roof over Denver all the way to (season 3 volume 2) the burning cabin season finale. This season provides many pivotal moments: Alexis gradually assumes the shoulder padded mantle of powerful businesswoman, yet another lost Carrington heir pops up to cause more trouble, Fallon opens La Mirage with a jazz age party Fitzgerald would've killed to attend, Jeff is poisoned by paint fumes, Steven returns with a reconstructed mug and a smidgen less antagonistic attitude, Kirby does Sabrina with disastrous results. And let's not forget the brawl in the lilly pond! Some scenes are positively operatic: when Cecil Colby has a fatal heart attack with Alexis standing by his hospital bedside in bridal white (!) - the score plays strings each time they try to defibrillate him and crescendos when he flatlines, closing with a distraught Alexis bowed head weeping behind white veil - ah, good times that! - Maria Callas as Lucia di Lamermoor couldn't have done any better. Kidding. Arguably the other primetime serials were better written or had more fleshed out characterizations - yet none of them compares to the stylized histrionics of Denver's first family.

DYNASTY was a prime-time soap opera that aired on ABC from 1981-89 regarding a bunch of rich people humping each other who had the best lifestyles, the best houses, the best cars, the best looking women, the best parties, etc. that made a lot of people, including myself wanting to live like them, especially like Blake Carrington(John Forsythe)and Krystle Carrington(Linda Evans)who had frequent catfights with Blake's scheming ex-wife Alexis Carrington(Joan Collins)who was often either rolling on the floor with Krystle or rolling in the sheets with Blake's rivals.

It was also interesting having Pamela Sue Martin from THE HARDY BOYS co-starring on this show as well as Heather Locklear portraying Krystle's sleazy niece(Sammy Jo Dean)in this 1982-1983 Season too.

It's just too bad that DYNASTY couldn't last as long as DALLAS and that its ratings weren't as strong either since DALLAS was already in its 11th Season on CBS when ABC cancelled DYNASTY in the Spring of 1989, due to toppling ratings.",1345507200,,1288,4.89908256880734

3379819,4,B0015I2S7E,"The ABC Network's answer to the hugely-popular primetime soap ""Dallas"", DYNASTY was created by Esther and Richard Shapiro to be the most flamboyant, daring and outrageous of all night-time drama series.  The lives of Denver's oil-rich Carrington family unfolded each and every week to the fascination of viewers all over the world, who couldn't get enough of their scandalous private affairs.

The third season opens with Blake (John Forsythe) lying unconcious on the edge of the cliff, after a fight with Dr. Nick Toscanni.  That will be the least of Blake's problems in this year!  When Alexis (Joan Collins) manages to drag up Krystle's ex-husband Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott), it's revealed that their Mexican divorce might not have been legal!  And as for Alexis, she marries Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) in the hospital after his near-fatal heart attack, and soon finds herself with ColbyCo. in her lap when Cecil kicks the bucket altogether.

The search for Blake Junior escalates, when ""Crazy Claudia"" (Pamela Bellwood) is seen clutching what appears to be the baby on the roof of a seedy hotel.  Alexis has a steamy affair with Mark; and Krystle (Linda Evans) once again gets on rocky ground with Blake when he discovers the amount of time that she seems to be spending with her ex.

Prodigal son Steven is involved in an oil-rig explosion near Singapore and returns to Denver with the face of Jack Coleman (original ""Steven"" Al Corley left the show at the end of the second year after becoming disillusioned by the scriptwriters).  And the long-lost first son of Blake and Alexis, Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson) appears literally out of the blue to claim his share of the family business - and soon has everyone offside!

Poor Jeff (John James) is driven out of his gourd by toxic paint fumes in his new ColbyCo. office; and Kirby (Kathleen Beller), Joseph's lovely daughter, makes her ""Sabrina""-esque entrance after returning from a long stay in Europe--and quicky sets about landing Jeff!

This set includes the first 12 episodes from the third season:

3379820,1,B0015I2S7E,"As a teenager I was a huge fan of Dynasty in the second half of its 9 year run, from the mid to late '80s. However, I missed out on seeing the early seasons, and was always keen to see them, as I really used to like this show. So, after all these years, I keenly awaited the DVD releases to revisit a show I remembered fondly from over 20 years ago.
What a disappointment! The show has dated badly and was nowhere near as enjoyable as I remember it. While Season 2 had its moments, Season 3 was pretty poor. The storylines in this season became too over-the-top, sensational and hard to believe. I know the show is only a soap, and was meant to be larger than life escapism and not to be taken too seriously, but I actually found I couldn't take it seriously at all. I can go along with sensational storylines to a point, but if plots don't have some logical explanation, with some vaguely realistic reactions and dialogue from characters, and don't make some attempt to be based in the real world- even a little- then I lose interest.
The dialogue here is always dramatic and grand, and not very believable: scenes are either sentimental with characters professing their love for each other, or characters fighting, feuding and plotting. There are few in-betweens, and little mature character interaction.
The character of Adam Carrington is farcical: kidnapped at birth and raised by his kidnapper on a remote farm, he grows up to be a suave, intelligent and well-groomed lawyer who returns to the family and is accepted into it within a few episodes, with little proof of his identity (a baby's rattle!).  A few episodes later, having just joined this multi-millionaire oil dynasty, he plots to murder his new brother-in-law - for little apparent reason- by painting his office with poisonous paint (the poison ends up making its victim aggressive for several episodes).
Plots are not logically worked out, they are just melodramatic and move too fast. Characters are thrown from one crisis to another, no matter how ludicrous, with each crisis being forgotten a few episodes later with no real lasting impact.
Chararacters are two dimensional, and are given little motivation for why they do the things they do: they do it either because they are ""good"" (like Krystle) or ""evil"" (like Adam.). Fallon Carrington's character is watered down this season, and has unfortunately lost its bite. The butler Joseph barely gets one dimension - he's just bland (or maybe it's just the actor playing him).
The show does have its good points, however -it must have done something right to be so popular back then. One of TV's greatest intro's and theme tunes, and John Forsythe, Linda Evans, Joan Collins and Pamela Sue Martin, who are fine actors and great to watch, and who have a good chemistry with each other. And it does have its fun moments, such as Krystle and Alexis' famous pond fight. And it also captures the greed, excess, fashion and conservativeness of the `80s well. But that's about it. If you want to watch a good `80s drama about an oil-rich feuding family, with better plots, more believable stories, and well-developed characters, buy Dallas instead.",1270771200,,3163,4.782449725776965
3379821,3,B0015I2S7E,"Although the .... ummmm .... colorful young men who still swoon over DYNASTY tend to insist it was all ""perfect"" (except for that nasty Season 1 which was too smart and character-based and sequin-deficient to really work for them), Season 3 is where the seeds for DYNASTY's downfall were originally sewn.

Season 1, as I said, was a well-crafted drama (with a legitimate sociopolitical subtext!) although a bit too leisurely-paced, perhaps. And Krystle was still a three-dimensional character. Then, in Season 2, Joan Collins enters the picture as mysterious ex-wife Alexis living in the art studio three feet from the house, which was splashy, cleverly-conceived and well-played fun.

So imagine my shock and disappointment when Season 3 premiered and all of that was .... gone.

Suddenly, the producers had changed the tone of their burgeoning hit show, contriving a misguided, furiously-adhered-to (for six years!) static acting directive designed to make the already-poised actors seem even MORE poised (yet did the opposite) while any narrative logic in the scripts was thrown out the window, hyperbolic love/hate repartee substituting for any kind of focus or flow to the stories... At once, all the characters became equidistant from one another, knew each other equally well, spoke in interchangeable dialogue. Gone was any warranted cynicism about wealth and the wealthy, replaced with a dreadful, fawningly '80s ""rich-people-are-good/poor-people-are-horrible"" mindset. And every corner of the show is now infected.

Yes, the introduction of snarling, long-lost son Adam (well-cast with Gordon Thomson) and his vaguely incestuous relationship with mother Alexis was a good thing, and the defining storyline of the season. But even that is lessened by the fact that Alexis has been transformed overnight from the grasping and manipulative socialite she was the previous season to brilliant Empress of Industry, with no transition period shown at all. Now that she is the just-add-water Queen of the Planet, she no longer has to purr and scheme and deceive; she simply openly insults and bitches everybody out in every scene, removing the sense of intelligence and mystery she once displayed and, likewise, any sense of her enigmatic backstory. She's just a spoiled cow now. Only a cow dressed in fur.

But the biggest loss is what happens to Krystle, the golden heroine once so soulfully played by Linda Evans. Krystle had at one time provided the moral voice for this show now so contemptuous of such perspective. With the downturn in the writing in season 3, the actors' simultaneously being restrained into excessive physical rigidity, and the loss of the producers' interest in anything not reflective of Reagan's smugly mercenary value system, Krystle quickly becomes a vapid and saccharine Stepford wife and exactly the goody-goody Alexis had always (and once unjustly) accused her of. And Evans' performance suffers pointedly: her clear-eyed countenance now increasingly replaced with a cross-eyed squealing of her lines (thank goodness the new producers from Season 9 finally acknowledged this change, cleverly chalking it up to a brain injury from years before!)... Just as Vivien Leigh was born to play Scarlett O'Hara, Linda Evans and Joan Collins seemed born to play Krystle and Alexis (as Season 2 gives most vivid evidence). They were PERFECT casting. Yet as the Good Queen is neglected and trivialized in Season 3 and beyond, the Bad Queen also suffers: Alexis no longer has a valid, statured, female partner with whom to spar.

These problems continued -- and were exacerbated -- for years. All the way thru Season 8... Star appeal and middling glitz and the program's obvious potential and a formidable Spelling/ABC public relations campaign kept the show in the press and high in the ratings for a few more seasons, the poorly-resolved Moldavian Massacre early in Season 6 often cited for its eventual collapse. But this briefly-great show was REALLY killed once bleating Krystle pulled Blake off that rainy mountainside at the outset of Season 3, Blake moaning in soapy splendor, ""Krystle, I must get home!""

3379827,5,B0015I2S7E,"I know there has been much controversy surrounding how Paramount is splitting the ""Dynasty"" DVD's into two volumes, but my attitude is that at least the studio is releasing them! I know it's more money for the consumer, but look at the shoddy way Fox released the first season of ""Dynasty""; they released it and no other releases became available. Also, if we boycott Paramount's releases of ""Dynasty"" we risk the fact that the studio will pull any future releases and we die-hard fans don't want that to happen.
 I have already purchased both volumes of ""Dynasty Season 3"" and Paramount has done another great job with the boxsets. The shows are picture perfect with wonderful audio and the shows themselves look like they were filmed yesterday. I also like the packaging of the dicks too.
  ""Dynasty"" became the 5th highest rated show on network TV in the 1983-84 season and it was because of the great writing and acting of the cast. Joan Collins continued to be the great villin everyone loved even surpassing Larry Hagman's J.R., and there were some wonderful cast additions like hunk Geofrey Scott who played Krystal's ex-husband Mark Jennings, who became involved with both Fallon and Alexis!. The biggest addition is Gordon Thompson, fresh from his role on ""Ryan's Hope"", who arrives in Denver as Adam, Blake and Alexis' long-lost son kidnapped at birth. Adam became the male antagonist everyone loved to hate, even going so far as poisining Jeff and raping a girl. There's also a new Steven, Jake Coleman from ""Days of our Lives"". Although not my favorite Steven, Coleman eventually makes Steven his own. Heather Locklear also returns in a few episodes as Sammy Jo, playing the tramp to perfection.
 This boxset contains the first 12 shows and ends with Sammy Jo arriving with a baby in tow at the Carrington mansion. ""Dynasty"" will always be the best primetime serial ever!",1236816000,2,1883,4.875
3379828,1,B0015I2S7E,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of criticism against CBS/Paramount for the way they are handling the distribution of the ABC primetime soap ""Dynasty"".  Fox was able to release the first season complete; and CBS/Paramount did the same for season two, so why the change over to volumes?  The only answer has to be old fashioned greed.

The reason I say greed is because this volume contains 12 episodes, yet costs just as much as the entire second season, which had 22. (You can even get the first two seasons for less than $10.00 more than this first half of season three.)

To be clear, this is the reason for my opposition to purchasing this set: the price.  I'm not really concerned about splitting the season into two, but the fact that CBS/Paramount is trying to peddle half a season at a full season price is where I draw the line.  If this was priced at say $17.00 to $19.00, people may not be so hostile to purchasing the set, because the price would be more in line with what is being offered (12 episodes vs. 22).

Finally, the other critique with seasons released in two volumes, it will take longer to complete all nine seasons.  CBS/Paramount can have two releases a year, but only put out one season.  If CBS/Paramount does indeed finish the ""Dynasty"" series, it will likely take longer to get 9 seasons of that series than it took Warner Bros. to release 14 seasons of ""Dallas"" (including the TV Movies release).

P.S. All this talk about criticism damaging future releases hasn't come true - CBS/Paramount will release Season 4 Vol. 1 in April.",1233100800,2,1561,4.562724014336918

What a load of @#%$...Go to hell Paramount....Everyone boycott them and don't buy anything off them!!!!,1232582400,,383,4.260273972602739
3379830,3,B0015I2S7E,"Yes, splitting the seasons is annoying.  But if its the only way to get the show released on DVD, then we have to deal with it. The low sales of season 1 caused years of delay before Season 2 was released.  And with these specialty audience sets that aren't as popular, retailers don't like to stock $60 items that will go unbought and collect dust on their shelves.

Dynasty isn't the first show to have split seasons, won't be the last.  All this buying it used talk will only serve to ensure seasons 4-9 don't get a release if the studios don't make a profit off these sets.",1231027200,,577,4.314814814814815
3379831,4,B0015I2S7E,"Is this release worth purchasing? Yes. As commented on in many reviews, the main flaw, and part of the reason this isn't a five-star product, is Paramount's decision to begin breaking the DVD release of shows like ""Dynasty"" down into separate volumes and then proceeding to charge the price of what one entire season used to sell for. For a fan of the show, it's disappointing to have to wait months, and then having to shell out more money, for one entire season of the show.  Another flaw with this release is that even at the hefty price (especially since it seems to have been a limited-time release and hard to find) there are no extra features! All you're getting with this release is indeed 12 episodes. Now, don't worry, there is some good.

""Dynasty"" season 3 is just as good as the previous seasons plot-wise. This is quality t.v. and the era of ""Dynasty"" before the outlandish, stereotypical 'soap' plots. If you're looking for a good drama with actors who can actually act and make you forget you're watching a prime-time soap, this show and release is for you. Season 3 continues the plots began in Season 2 with Alexis (Joan Collins) stirring up trouble for Blake (John Forsythe) by entering into the oil business ring. After dealing with Krystle's past in earlier seasons (Linda Evans) always dogging her current marriage, yet another past lover shows up - her ex-husband who brings news that rattles Krystle and Blake's now solid relationship. Steven's gone missing, another Carrington son has now shown up at Blake's doorstep, Fallon and Jeff are still on the outs and the set ends with the return of Sammy Jo and yet another new addition to the Carrington clan. With all this drama, it was nice to see the character being challenged and pushed emotionally and nothing really felt sensational or 'unbelievable' as in the later season. Each episode ends with some sort of cliffhanger to keep you coming back for more, including the final episode of the 3-disc set.

Quality wise, the transfer to DVD, as seen in the previous release, was great. The colors are vibrant, the sound is wonderful. The only thing that really holds this set back is the fact that it's incomplete and you have to dish out another twenty- or thirty-some dollars to complete it. That and the fact that there are absolutely no extra features, even with there having been a ""Dynasty"" cast reunion with interviews shot a few years ago that aired on ABC, Paramount still makes no effort to beef up the release, leaving the audience with just episodes, half a season, to feast on. Besides that, this was truly great television and it is nice to see it getting the DVD treatment, even if it is slow and now prolonged with split season releases. Definitely worth buying, even with it being a truncated release.",1229817600,,2793,4.731006160164271
3379832,4,B0015I2S7E,"It is unfortunate that the decision was made to split the seasons. The only reason is to charge more for the DVD sets. However even with this annoying sales pitch Dynasty is still a winner. I was a fan from the begining because of Steven's character being gay, when he went off after season two to find himself and work on an oil rig (oh, really gay proffession? go figure) I kind of went off Dynasty and hence missed most of this season. I am very pleased to be able to catch up on how Adam turned up, how he poisoned Jeff, how Kirby came back home and where La Mirage came from.

There are quite a few set ups in the first part of this season and a few story arcs that are constanly referred to in later seasons. It is nice to understand the whole back story to these. Krystal and Alexis are as always resplendant in the clothes they wear. Krystle's hair was never practicle. Unlike Alexis' who changed her style often. I must admit I had to laugh at the whole wedding in the hospital thing, could Cecil be that dumb. You could nearly see Alexis salivating at the idea of controling a company big enough to beat Blake at his own game.

Sammy Jo comes out of the wood work with a baby she claims to be Steven's. Steven is seen in shadow working on an oil rig as he was destined to get blown up and as Al Corley bowed out of he role to be replaced with a very young Jack Coleman who turned up years later in Heroes as Noah Bennett.

And speaking of youth. It's interesting to see Heather Locklear prior to her Melrose Place days. It is obvious her acting talent improved and she lost that small town annoying voice of hers. So I can't wait till part two arives in a few days so I can see how the new Steven is revealed, how Adam gets away with trying to kill Jeff, who Kirby sleeps with first, Jeff or Adam, and whats in store for Blake and Krystle.

The basis of this first half is all about Adam coming into the picture. I was shocked how poorly his arrival was written in. There was NO suspense whatsoever, it was like he found out he was a Carrington and in an episode or two he was working with Alexis at Colby Co. I was hoping for a more dramatic entrance, and whatever happened to the DNA test, I know those existed back then and its not like Blake couldn't afford it! Not really realistically written if you ask me. Still Adam is a chilling character, he definitely would play the perfect ""Cain"" to any ""Abel"" with those evil looking glares. Him raping Kirby was so cold but what made it odd was her reactiom after it was done. Kind of similar to when Blake raped Crystal in season 1.

Alexis manages to find Crystal's husband who Crystal thinks is her ex husband. Nothing really turns out like Alexis would have hoped and the way the first half ended looks like Alexis and Crystal's ex will be getting it on, that is of course after Falon already had a taste! I guess a foreshadow of what would come with Alexis' other daughter Amanda!

The first half ends with Steven's supposed death which we all know isn't a fact but still great drama as Blake becomes a madman to find his boy. Falon actually becomes human to Crystal and befriends her and of course Sammy Jo or as she likes to be called Samantha is back with Steven's supposed child and Heather doesn't dissapoint in the bitch department at all lol.

Overall great first half, feel jipped I have to wait months for the next half but what the heck, this show is WORTH IT!",1215907200,4,1812,4.336283185840708
3379837,3,B0015I2S7E,"I originally started buying shows like Dallas and Dynasty because my parents watched them when I was a kid, so I am seeing them for the first time.  From the price point, paying $30 for twelve episodes of a show that is almost as old as I am, I am conflicted about buying Dynasty at all.  It has its fun moments, but its essentially a brand-x Dallas.
THE BAD:  Blake Carrington, who can never decide whether he's the benevolent patriarch or a J.R. Ewing-esque plotter, gets caught by surprise too often to be believable.  Jeff is bland, Fallon is whiny and spoiled, Claudia is superfluous, and the writers never seemed to decide whether Steven was gay or straight.  As for the storylines, Adam's introduction was abrupt and strained credulity and the abduction of little Blake eachoed little John's abduction on Dallas too closely.
THE GOOD:  Alexis Carrington Colby is perfect as the unapologetically nasty diva, and I'm sure more great moments would have been ahead. Adam's slowly driving Jeff crazy with psychoactive paint in his office was classic.
Now, I enjoyed season two as it wound on and the storylines got more involved, so perhaps if the entire season had been released at once I would have enjoyed it more.  Dallas, too, often took most of a season to really get addictive.  If Dynasty cost less, I would recommend it for a lark.  All I can say is that the studios have to realize that these older shows are not in that much demand and are becoming more and more dated, so maybe they should use a lower price point to sell them.",1215561600,4,1541,4.615384615384615

I have no problem with a higher price being charged for Season 3 than Seasons 1 or 2.  The first two seasons were quite a deal.  If too much is being charged, then customers will not buy the season, but somehow I doubt that is the case.

On Amazon, Season 2 is about $7 more than this particular set. Who knows why the powers-that-be chose to release this season in a split set...greed, economics, who knows...and no point arguing it here. What I do know is that the visuals on this particular set are fantastic. Color, clarity, resolution...it truly looks wonderful, as if it were filmed yesterday...except for the decidedly 1980's Nolan Miller fashions and over-the-top drama! The other thing I know is that this particular set has no extras; nada, zip, zero, zilcho, other than a few previews of other DVD's available. This is almost as big a sin as splitting the season in half.

Storyline, plenty happens in Season 3; this show had already hit its stride in Season 2 and fans were treated to exactly what they wanted: the strong bond of love between Krystal Carrington (Linda Evans) and her husband wealthy Denver tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe); plenty of plot-stirring hyjinks by Blake's ex-wife Alexis (Joan Collins) who uses anything to get back at Blake, including a son who was kidnapped at birth (Adam Carrington) and the first not-so-ex husband of Krystal, hunky tennis-pro Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott). Confused? Hang on, there are even more characters that get thrown into the pot this season: Krystal's scheming niece, Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear), who shows up just in time during the episode 12 to claim her ""late"" husband Steven Carrington's inheritance; Kirby (Kathleen Beller), the daughter of Blake's trusted servant Joseph, who stirs the hearts of Adam Carrington & Fallon's husband Jeff...oh yeah, he's also the guy who is being driven crazy by Adam because Adam doesn't want to share Colby Co., Alexis' company that she acquired through a quickie marriage in a hospital...damn, how confusing! Just get the series and it will all make sense (other than the oft-married Alexis wearing white and a veil to her umpteenth wedding held next to an oxygen tent - has she no shame?!?). You won't want to miss the drama, the fashion, the catfights, and the absolutely silly antics of the rich and famous of the 1980's.

For the episodes and quality of the transfer, I give this set a 5 star rating; for splitting the season in half and having no extras, I give it a 2 star rating; overall, I'll render a verdict of 3 stars and leave it up to you whether you want to buy it new, used, or wait until Bluray may bring out a whole nex product.",1214006400,15,2550,4.806378132118451

Paramount has us over a barrel here.  If we boycott this, they may not release Volume Two or future seasons.  If we do buy it, it will ensure they keep up these same greedy tactics.  I went ahead and bought it because I need to see what happens next.  I am not disappointed, but am annoyed that I spent the same on a half season that I did the previous full ones.  There's a recession going on, consumer confidence is down so we are asked to spend more.

What's really galling is that other shows get the Volume One treatment.  But those are shows like ""The Love Boat"" and ""Love American Style.""  Who cares how many volumes they're sold in: they're not serialized dramas.  No, this Volume One and Two tactic is cruel and unnecessary.

Adam Carrington is introduced and this creates a nifty backdoor for the writers that can explain away Blake's behavior in season one; so that's why Blake was such a jerk.  It's a clever move and also gives the show its reigning male villain in Adam.  Plus, this volume also features the classic ""Claudia on the rooftop"" scenario that is heartbreaking and nailbiting.

The big lily pond battle occurs in Season Three as well, but we have to wait until Volume Two.  Let's hope it gets released soon.",1214006400,5,1437,4.469230769230769

If people boycott these half seasons, hopefully the powers that be will come to their senses and bring back the full season sets. This an ADDITION To My Original Review. I noticed that The Day this Set went on sale on amazon(Dynasty Season Three Vol One), it PEAKED at #190 on the DVD sales chart. Last year when Season Two Was released(The ENTIRE Season), it cracked the  Top 30 on Amazon's DVD sales chart. The Dallas Seasons usually always crack the Top 10 on the Amazon sales chart when they are relased. So I suggest that the Studio that is responible for releasing this current Dynasty DVD set , take a cold hard look at the poor showing on the Amazon Sales chart and rethink releasing vol 2 and just go ahead and release the entire season 3 because that is the ONLY way I will buy it!",1213228800,,1454,4.302919708029197

My five star rating is for the dvd's content and sound and vision quality.

If I were to rate Paramounts decision to now release split seasons after waited so long it would be -5 stars.

The picture quality on the dvd's is as good as the previous seasons. The credits are a little grainy but after that the picture is really good. Paramount have done a very good job with the remastering. The sound is is crystal clear.

I've watched Alexis's wedding to Cecil, the 20's Party at La Mirage, and the picture is wonderful, there's so much more fine detail and texture in the costumes and set, Alexis's outfit's look particularly good.

Dynasty is a wonderful tv drama that lasted 9 years and provided some of the best entertainment for the decade. The classic fight scenes between Alexis and Krystal are worth the price of the set alone!  The show is classic camp and Joan Collins really made the show.  The first season was ok but it really took off after Joan arrived.  I remember every Wednesday night watching this show and was so upset when the spin-off The Colbys was placed opposite Knots Landing.  I hope they bring that show out on DVD as well because some key characters were on each show.

With the price of tv shows on DVD, this isn't that bad of a deal even if you have to buy it in two installments.  Some shows are $90 for a season (CSI and most cable shows), so if I have to pay $50 for a season of Dynasty, I'll do it and it's easier on my wallet to do that in two different installments!  I'll enjoy this show for many years to come.  My complaint is that it has taken too long to enjoy this wonderful show on DVD and I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of Falcon Crest!  I mean, there are so many shows on DVD that did not live as long as Dynasty and were (in my opinion) not as good as Dynasty and they are already on DVD.  Let's just hope that they stop the split seasons later on when the show was losing some of it's steam and we can pay the low price that we paid for seasons 1 and 2 (let's face it, those were pretty cheap!).

Yes, utter nonsense most of the time, but really fun nonetheless. Dynasty was a colorful and over the top extravaganza that kept us coming back for more drama and fashion and fights.
I have enjoyed a lot of TV in my life, from Northern Exposure and Upstairs Downstairs to Seinfeld and Green Acres. Dynasty remains a pleasure no matter how ridiculous it seems. The plots were zany, to be honest. But the show is just a hoot, plain and simple.

That being said, I am outraged that Season 3 (and possibly future seasons) is going to be divided up into volumes instead of complete seasons. I can only guess that the studio wants to milk us of our cash. Studios have done this cheesy practice with other shows, such as Lost in Space, Spongebob, and so forth. What pigs these companies can be sometimes.
Like other reviewers here, I am furious and disgusted at the ugly amount of greed and at the severe lack of respect for the customer. I will not be buying this until the price is cut significantly for half a season. I love the program but not this much.

And in the end, the studio will blame poor sales when they cancel any future releases and the Dynasty series dies.

Maybe they can release ""The Colbys"" on VHS and charge more for the much larger packaging.

3379892,4,B0015I2S7E,"At last season 3 is about to be released and although i agree that releasing only half season SUCKS (that's why i give it 4 stars), we can't turn our back cause it seems that season 2 did well enough and the studio desided to earn more $$$ by releasing this season in two parts.
 Again i will say that i don't like it but i have no other choice than to buy it and wait for part 2 to complete the third season.
 I know it will cost more $$$ but at least i will have the official season 3 in my hands and even if they will release in this way all other seasons i will buy them to have the real thing but let's hope the next seasons will come at one piece and i have to warn you that u will not get a complete season 3 but only in two volumes so like it or not u have no choice but to support those releases EVEN IF U DON'T LIKE IT LIKE I ALSO DON'T LIKE IT so that we can get the future seasons as well either in one or in two volumes.
 I don't care. I just wanna the whole series.
 In season 3 we get to know adam carrington as well jack coleman as the new ""face"" of steven carrington and also joseph's daughter kirby appears with a lot of other surprises.
 Season 3 is the first season which entered nielsen's top 5 back in 1983. Season 4 picked #3 and season 5 finished at NO 1 in 1985.
 Hope they will release all 9 seasons plus the reunion movie soon...",1205280000,6,1356,3.8422939068100357

Why has Dynasty Season 3 been seperated into Volumes? I have no intention of buying 2 seperate volumes - I will just wait for there to be a complete Season 3 box set.
The packaging for Season 2 was excellent - slimline case (the same size as a standard case) containing 6 discs. I could not fault it at all.
We had to wait so long for Season 2 and now with Season 3 devoted fans of the series are being messed around given Volumes?
Get you act together and give us complete season box sets.
I can't see any reason for only giving us three disc and half a series, apart from doubling the cost to the customer.",1205280000,10,813,5.213740458015267
