3648335,3,B001IER66I,"I got this to test out my DTS HD 7.1 sound system and my new Panasonic DMP BD55 player (great -- from Amazon).  The packing looks like something you would buy on the street in Shanghai.  The paperwork liner is sketchy and cheap.  What intrigues me is the phrase (which IS included in the Amazon ad info -- and I missed): ""PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RECORD WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED FOR 5.1 AND PRESENTED FOR 7.1 SURROUND SOUND REPRODUCTION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH UNIQUE ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPERIENCE.""  The music is fine and it drives all 7 speakers and subwoofer but I have feeling this is an ""upconverted/remastered"" recording.  I also got the similarly packaged and documented Vivaldi ""DTS-HD Master Audio Disk"" recording for a total of $45. Is there any ""native mastered DTS-HD"" (my terminology) available?  Three stars because I am suspicious.",1231459200,5,836,4.8936170212765955

8310880,1,B001IER66I,"I played this on my high end system and it really has poor sound. Lack of treble, no spatial feeling. Alfred Brendel sounds much better and has more clarity on my CDs, although  those are much older, but they must have been produced with greater care.
The artifial surround modes of a good AV processor give a better surround feeling.
Just listen to any of the Nordic Sound Audiophile Recordings (available at amazon, on SACD and Blu Ray Audio) and you will immediately hear the difference.
There is one fundamental difference: Nordic Audio does record in 5.1 or 7.1 lossless, whereas fromer techno music performer turned into surround artist Alexander Jero (CV to be found here:[...]) uses old catalog recordings and then tries to get some surround ""experience"" out of these. Why does he try to engineer something into recordings that has never been there?
You get more and correcter spatial information from a quality 2 channel recording than from these artificially blown up ""works of art"". In the description it says they have been blown up from 5.1 to 7.1, my guess is that at the origin there might very well be 2 channel recordings.
This might sound impressive for somebody who has never experienced real audiophile recordings in 7.1 or 5.1, because for a first timer it is so exciting to hear something from all of your speakers, but it is miles away from reality and definitively not an audiophile grade recording.
By reading the numerous bad reviews here on amazon, you will find that his ""acoustic reality experience"" does not have too many fans here.
From a technical point of view, the Nordic Audio (NA) recordings uses more than twice the data rate than the Acoustic ""Virtual"" Reality Experience counterparts, they are pressed on blu ray, A Jero does homeburning on a PC to produce socalled mini Blu Rays on a DVD R medium, there is a booklet and professionally printed sleeve with NA titles, whereas you get almost no info on the illisible sleeve and no booklet. At least you get a picture of Alexander Jero on almost every cover of his productions.

8310881,3,B001IER66I,"The sound is mostly coming from the front speakers. The others are weak. The performance is no better than an average music CD which has stereo recording.

8310882,1,B001IER66I,"I bought several blue ray 7.1 channel classical music titles from Amazon in 2009-2010, none of them live up to my expection.  They simply do not play all the way through and for the part that they play, the audio is well below my expection.  Those purchases were a waste of money for me and may be the technology or the available recording is not yet ready? (IMHO).",1293321600,3,365,4.352941176470588

When I tried to play the DVD, both players displayed a message: ""Can not operate disc"". When I received the disc from Amazon.com, I noticed the DVD didn't have a security tape around it which made beleive that sone else returned it as non-playble. The  Blu-ray disc is region 1 and should play in the United States. I returned it to amazon and requested a replacemnet but it's out of of stock right now.

8310885,1,B001IER66I,"I really want to write a good review, but I must warn people about this disk.

IT IS NOT A BLURAY!

As you read that you might think... "" So what's the big deal? "" Simple, Amazon markets it as a bluray. The case, and the insert inside markets it as bluray... but this is a DVD. Again you might say "" So, it's a DVD? Big deal "" Thing is, it's not even a professional press. The damn DVD is nothing more than disks you can buy at any retailer.

Final note... Some guy used nero and made a bunch of copies with dvds he bought at fry's electronics for $25",1268611200,5,551,3.9017857142857144
8310886,2,B001IER66I,"Amazon replaced my first disk that didn't play with another that doesn't work.

8310887,1,B001IER66I,"Brendel's performances are good. The concerto appears to be the same as the recent Phillips release on hybrid SACD.

The sound in stereo is decent, but in the 7.1 DTS DTS-HD Master audio mode, it is practically unlistenable. Also the production and the packing is amateurish.

Let me elaborate:
1) The sound:  I listened to this using a recently acquired OPPO Blu-Ray player connected using HDMI 1.3 to an Integra DTC 9.8 preamp that decodes the signal. Both of these unit work fine. For example the recent Blu-Ray La Traviata provided some of the best surround sound I have heard. On this disk, the surround sound was full of distortion and the sound came from no obvious place. On the solo piano pieces, one felt one was inside the piano. When I swithced to stereo mode, the sound was fine. I have no idea how they generated the surround channels. It seemed as if they used some sort of frequency filtering rather than 7 tracks recorded at different position in  a concert hall.

2)The production: This is not a normal professional stamped Blu-Ray disk. It was apparently recorded onto a Blu-Ray DVD-R disk. You can tell in two ways: a) The playing side is not silver, but the purple color of the dyes used in these kinds of disks; 2) the disk was labeled at the center hole with Ritek's RiData trademark.
The cover and insert make no mention of Mackerras (the conductor) nor do they correctly labeled the work as K503. Instead the refer to it as opus 18!

I would definitely avoid this disk (and others from the same company). Buy the SACD or the CD.",1243641600,5,1553,4.568345323741007
8310888,1,B001IER66I,"I bought three of this company's Blu-rays ... save your money and get the CD. Better yet, get an SACD version for real high-quality sound. I have ""Tchaikovsky Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3,"" ""Bach Orchestral Suites No. 1, 2 & 3,"" and ""Vivaldi Four Seasons"" in these discs. None will play in my Samsung Blu-ray player with the latest firmware. All play in my Panasonic. The sound quality is no better than standard quality 5.1 surround; in fact, I suspect they just copied the material from a standard 5.1 version. There's very little sound in the rear channels and virtually no separation. Sounds like stereo. Save your money, these are a rip-off.",1238025600,6,644,4.707964601769912
