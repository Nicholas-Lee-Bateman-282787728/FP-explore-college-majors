8138370,5,B000HC2O5K,"In ""Nos reimos de la migra"" (from 1984), we have a Mexican sex-comedy with, all the endearing/vulgar elements that defines this comedy sub-genre. Featuring an all-star cast: Rafael Inclan, Isela Vega, Roberto 'el flaco' Guzman, Maria Cardinal, Rebeca Silva, Polo Ortin, etc. There's plenty of laughs and above all; ample, sultry and sexy - FFN from the female stars (Isela Vega, Rebeca Silva, Maria Cardinal), so you won't feel cheated with this one! The DVD picture and sound quality is very good. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 98 mins.

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1424044800,,579,5.094736842105263
8138371,1,B000HC2O5K,"This movie took turns amazing and delighting me until I finally tapped out from Entertainment Excess Syndrome. It has it all-- bikinis, skeevy men boogying in their boxers, and lots of snappy Spanish dialogue which I can't understand. It's shot up to no. @354,000 in Amazon's movie rankings, and with good reason. All I can say is 'si! si! see!'",1362355200,,345,4.766666666666667
