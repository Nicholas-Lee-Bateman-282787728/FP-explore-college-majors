8064255,5,B0009OJ93G,"I watched the first season of Juliet Bravo earlier this year and enjoyed it very much. The series revolves around Chief Inspector (ie, Police Chief) Jean Darblay, the first woman to be assigned the position in the suburb of Hartley. She initially experiences some prejudice on the part of the officers assigned to the station, but soon wins them over, though periodically still getting such prejudice from some of her higher-ups. The notion of a woman Senior was a new one in Britain in the early 1980s, and this series uses that as it's starting point.

As a product of the 1980's, the series is significantly 'kinder and gentler' than the current style of 'crime drama' in early 2000's US television, and deals much more with the lives of the people involved than 'hard-hitting' procedural crime solving. Violence and gritty drama it is not. In that sense, this show is reminiscent of ""In the Heat of the Night"", or for those who remember it, ""Naked City"" from the early 1960's; evidence that a good police drama can be made without guns being plastered against cop's noses and thugs being smashed into walls, when writers concentrate on good human-interest stories.

There is, BTW, no one named ""Juliet Bravo"" in the series; the title refers to the phonetic alphabet designation for the letters ""J"" and ""B"" , which are part of the Chief's radio call sign, though that fact is all but unmentioned in the series.

If your preference is for guns blasting, tires screeching, and bombs exploding, you'll find this series very tame by today's conventions. But if you enjoy good human-interest drama set against a police backdrop, this may be just the series for you.

These disks come with HOH English subtitles, which also come in handy for the non-HOH with ears not well tuned to the sound of British English.

Note that these are British DVDs (Region 2), and will not play on most standard DVD players in the US; but all-region (aka region-free) DVD players, many capable of converting PAL to NTSC, are widely available online, as well as here on Amazon. They're relatively inexpensive, and will open to you an interesting world of UK television. Many additional UK DVDs can be found on Amazon's UK website.",1305072000,2,2207,4.812664907651715
