8165114,1,B000LXSMAG,"This was my first Sara Holiday video. Her body looks good but I was not inspired at all by this video to get more in shape. I kept wondering to myself if she had a friend videotape her at the beach to keep costs down. The cuing is off and sound and video quality are sorely lacking. Boring. I couldn't get myself to re-play it so its the first workout video that I just gave up on and sent to the thrift shop...I hated it that much. I actually met her in person at a baby and maternity show and asked who her teachers were..people who inspired her and shaped her as an instructor--even martial arts teachers. She couldn't name one. She just said various and I wouldn't know them. I think if you cannot show gratitude to the people who teach you and help get you where you are, than what you are teaching isn't to be trusted. Its like you have no credentials. Its also a bit difficult for many postnatal moms- especially post-c-section. There are far better postnatal DVDs out there-- anything by Shiva Rea, Leisa Hart, Barry's Bootcamp would even do the trick with the modifications.",1258416000,,1083,4.42
8165115,1,B000LXSMAG,I got this video thinking I am going to like it as much as her prenatal ones but I was wrong. The movement is to fast and it's not that easy to follow it. It's not what I expected it to be.,1210809600,,189,3.5238095238095237
8165116,3,B000LXSMAG,"I bought this video about six months after I had my third baby.  I was well into a regular workout routine but found it hard to get to the gym sometimes.  So, I bought this DVD.  The workout is fine but the quality feels like a ""B"" movie.  The instructor does her own voice-over and sometimes the counts are off.  She's just smiling at you while you're watching her.  Kind of weird.

After I had done it a handful of times I got bored and found better workout DVDs.  Also, I like videos where the instructor and participants mirror me (i.e. they're on their left foot while I'm on my right foot).  If you're just getting started on your post-natal workout (~6 weeks), I'd purchase this video and do the workout until you're ready for something more challenging.",1207526400,,761,4.456521739130435
8165117,3,B000LXSMAG,"The first time I did this workout I was a little underwhelmed. It was fairly easy, the music was somewhat annoying and the cueing  was not always great. However, I have continued to use it in my rotation of workout DVDs and it has grown on me. It is short and basic, so its good for a naptime workout. This workout won't get you into great shape all on its own, but it has some very good points. The abdominal workout is really good, as is the kickboxing section and the squats/ plies. Overall, this is a decent, basic, easy workout.",1182211200,2,533,4.2772277227722775
8165118,5,B000LXSMAG,This is a great full body workout.  I am amazed at how much I feel the burn and my heart gets pumping in such a short amount of time.  Sara motivates you to keep going strong throughout the whole video.,1175731200,,202,4.025
8165119,5,B000LXSMAG,I love the quick workout that Sara shares on this DVD.  It provides a challenging workout for your whole body and is easy to complete - even in a busy household!  Sara is very motivating throughout the DVD as well.  It is a great option for days where I am not able to get out of the house to exercise.,1175040000,,302,4.0
8165120,5,B000LXSMAG,"I love this workout because it is fast-paced but easy to follow.  Sometimes I don't have a full hour to dedicate to exercising.  In a half hour, I can work all areas of my body, get my heart pumping and feel great.  The beach in the background is also nice.",1167868800,2,257,4.1
8165121,5,B000LXSMAG,I love this workout because it is quick and I was able to do it with my son playing in the room. It is a great workout for a rainy day. Even though it is quick you get a great total body workout.,1167177600,,195,3.558139534883721
8165122,5,B000LXSMAG,"This DVD focuses on my postnatal problem areas - waist, buttocks, and thighs.  I love the fact it is fast paced but at the same time easy to follow as Sara describes the movements just before you see them on screen.  I really enjoy this workout!

8165123,5,B000LXSMAG,"I am not ""post-natal"" but borrowed this DVD from a friend anyways because it looked like a great workout for someone with limited time. It was! 30 minutes in the comfort of my own home...definitely worked up a sweat and I could feel all the different muscles being worked. Unlike many workouts, this one addresses both cardio AND toning, and focusses on areas like the upper body that a lot of workout videos for women ignore. Great workout, even if you're not a mom!",1167004800,,467,4.571428571428571
