8420700,4,B004AR5824,"When I watched his for the first time I was surprised on how small the visual was on my laptop so I had to scale it up using the video player settings.

The subtitle font is okay, It's a bit large and sits at the bottom of the visual and not in the black space underneath. There probably is a way to change the subtitle settings in the video player I'm using that I just don't know of. Sometimes the subtitles cuts itself off and switches from someone speaking to someone speaking in the background even if the visual still shows the main person speaking. This  does subtitle screen cards or signs that pop up which made me happy because some don't do that.

The story is great which you can read from other reviews.

The audio is fine.

It comes with two DVDs and a dust cover thingie for the DVD case.

Overall If I ignore the size of the visual and low quality video(caused by scaling up the video size) it's really good. I don't know if I would recommend buying it though just for it might not be the quality you're looking for. But at the same time it's a great story.",1507766400,,1073,4.209756097560976

8420704,4,B004AR5824,"This anime is based off of the manga by Nakamura Yoshiki.  The story as you probably know from the other reviews is about a girl, Mogami Kyoko who spends her childhood devoted to a guy, Fuwa Sho who wants to become an idol.  When he goes to Tokyo, he asks her to come with him, and, overjoyed, she accepts only to find that he only wanted her as a maid.  She decides to take revenge by entering the entertainment world herself in order to out shine him in his own field.  She ends up working with Tsuruga Ren, who is Fuwa Sho's rival.

The story shows the main character growing, changing, and learning who she is after spending far too long devoting her life completely to someone else.

There is one problem with the anime.  It's not that it ends before the story is complete, which is only natural since the manga isn't complete yet, but where it ends.  It ends in the middle of a story arc and leaves the viewer dangling.  That is the only reason that it gets four stars instead of five.  I love the story so much that I have all of the manga available so far, the anime, and the live action Taiwanese drama.",1344211200,2,1112,4.252380952380952
8420705,5,B004AR5824,"If you like watching anime about show biz, you will love this! It begins with a plot about revenge, after Kyoko Mogami walks in on her hot shot rising star boyfriend Sho Fuwa talking smack about her. It quickly moves to a story of self-discovery and a reawakened ability to love.

When I watched the first episode I almost didn't continue... it didn't hook me, and I didn't think I was going to like the main character Kyoko. After the first three or four episodes I found myself completely sucked in, always wanting to know what was in store next. I finished all 26 episodes in two days. I have showed this to a number of my friends, who have all agreed with me -- if you can make it past the first three episodes or so, I guarantee you will love the series.

The only negative point about it (besides the beginning episodes) is that, like many awesome anime, the ending leaves much to be desired. The TV series only follows through about volume 10 of the manga. To give you an idea, the manga in Japan is currently up to volume 31 and still going. There are so many awesome things that happen just after the anime concluded, so if you want some closure you will have to read the manga, too. Again, the characters are really loveable, the opening and closing credits are cute and the art style is nice and it's a really, truly excellent series. Please try it out!",1335484800,7,1364,4.366141732283465
8420706,5,B004AR5824,"This series is great, at least a 9/10. The Japanese cast is one of the best I've seen and the story is very interesting and funny. For all of the fans of the series are wondering the same thing...WHY ISN'T THERE A SECOND SEASON??? There is enough material in the manga and this show is definitely more deserving than some other shows(who will remain nameless) of a second season.

Product Review: This is a legit set from Malaysia, it comes with 1 DVD packed with 25 episodes! Hard to believe but, it is a DVD-9 and comes with a slip cover. I played it on my PS3 which helps upconvert standard definition video to high definition so there were no problems there. The subs are not the best, but good enough and if you have a decent grasp of the English language it is a problem that is easy to overlook. Audio:9/10, Video 9/10

The set is a bit pricey at $50, but I really enjoy the series and think I got my money's worth and best of all I get to watch the series as it was meant to be watched on my big screen!",1328227200,12,1011,4.153061224489796
8420707,5,B004AR5824,"This is a brilliantly hilarious, but very well calculated and amazingly deep series.  I highly recommend it to aspiring actors and actresses (and other performing artists for that matter), and to anyone that wants a strong pick me up with a powerful,resonating message.

FOR THE PARENTS: If you are looking for a new show for a kid to watch, most of you are probably concerned about ""offensive content"".  I would definitely recommend this even for kids.  There is no nudity/fanservice type stuff and no real coarse language save the rare, occassional ""Damn"" expletive.  However, I would definitely recommend it to older ones  (12+) because, even though it is a very funny & clean show, there are many serious (and often subtle) themes in play, constantly.  It's what makes the show come alive, and children too young may miss those gems (unless perhaps you watch it with them...which I completely support).  It's definitely a good show that the whole family can watch, enjoy, and learn from...great discussions can even happen from it.

MOVING ON...
Well, by now, you probably have a good grasp of the plot from other reviews and the ""product synopsis"".  So I won't go that route.  What I can say is this was a very welcome surprise.  The program synopsis gives the impression that this is a mere ""revenge story"".  But truth is, it's much more than that.  When it comes down to it, the show is not so much about forgetting one's past or dwelling on it.  Instead, it's about seeing past it, finding the bigger picture, and learning to not only see yourself, but to see through the eyes of others.  It's about how our actions are like ripples in a pond spreading out towards all others in the cosmos.  It is a series about the redemption of broken and wounded hearts...that there is still a chance no matter how far gone.  There's so much humor to go around, but even that is driven by these messages and themes.  I found myself crying, angered, laughing, and often reflecting on the events that occurred.  The writers did an excellent job in the detail and depth they put in this show.  Not overly melodramatic...and still not hopelessly shallow.  This is one of the most serious and engaging, ""light pieces"" I've seen (if that makes any sense).

The character development and detail was magnificent, too.  No character (even the ""funny ones"") was shallow.  Each really had their own story to tell and heart to share...even the Chicken (if you watch it, you'll understand).  This is definitely a strong slice-of-life anime...and as such, it is important that the characters are strong, too.  The pacing of the story was definitely well done.  They knew how to bring tension to a breaking point without destroying it.  And the vibrancy of the colors, settings, and characters really captured the magic of show business.  The only partial weakness was the ending.  Some folks may not be satisfied with it.  But the thing was, it was still a fitting ending to what the anime focused on (keep in mind that is based off of a manga that already has MANY volumes)...and frankly the series overall had a strength and consistency that really overshadows that somewhat ""open"" ending (and that's coming from one who is near-adamant about strong resolutions).

All in all, this is a show i recommend to any aspiring performing artist that needs a good reminder of why they do what they do.  So many memorable and relatable characters, each with an experience to learn from.  It's also just generally a great show for anyone who needs encouragement when in a slump.  There is hope out there, even in your darkest hour.  And, revenge does grant strength, but with it comes a price to your abilities and humanity.  As Ren Tsugura (one of the characters) says, ""gut's can only get you so far.""  A very important statement that you begin to understand when you watch the show.",1327881600,3,3858,4.761689291101056
8420708,5,B004AR5824,"This is a fantastic series filled with drama, action, and a bit of romance. It isn't only about a girl who has been ""dumped"" by her superstar friend but her entire path towards revenge on him. This series made me laugh so hard that people gave me strange looks and I can promise you won't be regretful if you buy Skip Beat. :) Enjoy!",1292112000,15,333,4.21875
