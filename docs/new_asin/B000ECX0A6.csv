2516103,5,B000ECX0A6,"this is a hilarious asian stand up dvd, one of my favorite movies. it is funny every time i watch it! i highly recommend this dvd to anyone with a sense of humor :)",1266192000,,164,3.8529411764705883
2516104,2,B000ECX0A6,"As a Korean American, I thought I'd give this a go. Big mistake. With the possible exception of Steve Byrne, they were simply not very funny. It might have worked in an earlier era but filling your stage time with profanity and misogyny doesn't make you funny, just a bit pathetic.

What's up with that Dr. Ken? I saw him on the KoreAm awards, and see he's on all sorts of B movies now but he's simply not funny, just embarrassingly loud and persistent. Sort of like a Korean Borat only with no clever social commentary behind it.

Though I'd like to support my Asian brothers, I suggest you give this a miss.",1263686400,,609,4.380530973451328
2516105,2,B000ECX0A6,"This DVD proves that keeping mostly to ethnicity material can be a slippery slope.
Even though most of the predominantly Asian audience seems to crack up and find everything knee-slappingly funny, it mostly boils down to self-ironic ""yes, we're able (and willing) to laugh at our own stereotypes.""
Bobby Lee ends up having the weakest performance (perhaps the lineup-order provides a clue?). He's more proficient doing MadTV material than his own standup routine.
Kevin Shea has an angrier approach, but unfortunately restricts himself to a string of non-engaging one-liners.
Steve Byrne is quick and self-confident, but his love for animated sound effects and his ""this is Bruce Lee having sex"" bit is getting annoying and old.
Dr. Ken Jeong is the strongest performer, both material wise and being the one most comfortable in his own skin.
Personally, he's the only one of the bunch who made me laugh out loud (unfortunately, a one-time only experience watching this DVD). Granted, he probably has an advantage over the other guys with his 'Doctor by day, comedian by night' schtick.
All in all, if this material is your thing, you get more bang for the buck with comedians like Russell Peters (he does Asian, but a different kind of Asian).",1209945600,5,1243,5.009661835748792

Very original, funny material!  Can't wait for more!

2516109,5,B000ECX0A6,"This DVD was one of the funniest things I've seen in ages!  I don't remember when I've laughed that hard.  One question though, was Kevin Shea drunk?  His bit might've been funnier if he wasn't slurring his words.  Bobby Lee, Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken were all HILARIOUS!!  And to the guy who thought Dr. Ken was racist, it's called comedy.  It's open season on any subject, get a sense of humor!  The Vietnamese bit was classic hence everyone, mostly the Vietnamese audience members, laughing.",1149292800,9,492,4.7176470588235295
2516110,3,B000ECX0A6,"I'm Korean, and I totally support Korean talent.  Don't get me wrong, the first three comics were funny, but the last guy, the doctor, he was messed up big time.  He doesn't sound like a comedian at all, he sounds like exactly what he is: a doctor telling jokes.  His jokes aren't funny, at all, in fact they're racist as hell.  He blasts Vietnamese guys as being complete effeminite homos, as if having a Vietnamese wife makes it okay.  He even blasts Chinese people calling them ""chinks"" in a way like they're disgusting pieces of crap.  What an idiot!  A Korean guy calling Chinese people ""chinks""?  That's racist as hell!  Being Asian doesn't make it okay, and furthermore, it even makes the comic look dumber because he's putting his own race down.

The first three comics have real talent, especially Bobby Lee who shines on stage with a lot of charisma, but Dr. Ken screws up big time.",1148169600,9,892,4.5886075949367084
2516111,5,B000ECX0A6,"This DVD is hilarious. Steve Byrne and Dr Ken are the standouts and will have you laughing hysterically. I have already watched the main feature as well as the deleted scenes 6 times and it hasn't been a week since I got it yet. My only complaint is that it's too short, I want more already.

Don't think twice, just buy it, you will love it!",1146441600,7,342,4.181818181818182
2516112,5,B000ECX0A6,"I came across Dr. Ken's website and checked out some clips of his act and just fell in love with his comedic style.  A real doctor by day and awesome comic by night, he flat out rocks.  So when he began talking about his DVD on his website, I knew it would be good.

It is SOOOO much better than I could've imagined.  It features Bobby Lee of MAD TV, Kevin Shea, Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken.  They all were hilarious and I'd recommend this DVD to anyone.  The Asian comic market is largely untapped and it's shame because these 4 men will blow you away.

Most know Bobby Lee from MAD TV and he's awesome but the two standouts on this DVD are Steve Byrne and Dr. Ken.  Dr. Ken's brand of in your face humor about the medical field will leave you rolling as well and ""making it pretty"" for your doc in the future.  Steve Bryne's physical comedy is very reminiscent of Robin Williams and John Ritter and he's hysterical.

Bottom line...BUY THIS DVD...you won't be disappointed!",1146441600,12,970,4.338888888888889
