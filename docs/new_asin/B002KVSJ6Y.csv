8372268,4,B002KVSJ6Y,A ghost story with a great plot. This is not your average ghost story it has meaning. When a young man moves into Greville Lodge amazing things began to happen to him. He soon realizes he  is in the process of finishing a love story that started 100 years earlier. It is both a love story and a ghost story something you don't get to often in  this type movie. It is a very good movie with many turns and twist all leading to the completion of a 100 year old love story.,1415404800,,470,4.043010752688172

8372271,5,B002KVSJ6Y,"I enjoyed this movie very much,it was a good story with no sex and violence. It kept you interested right from the beginning to the end. All the actors were very good. The setting and the lodge was beautiful. The're aren't many movies out at the theater today worth going to see, so I look for movies on Amazon. They have a lot of good movies on there,and this was one of them. I'll be watching this movie again in the future.",1267056000,3,426,4.2073170731707314
8372272,3,B002KVSJ6Y,"""The Ghost of Greville Lodge"" is an interesting ghost story that will appeal to families as its not gory, explicit or overtly scary. Its very much a traditional ghost story, taking its time to let the story unfold and build its atmosphere. A teenage boy, James Greville (Jon Newman) has spent the greater part of his life in children's homes and is shocked to be told by social workers that he has a relative, a great uncle (George Cole) who has invited him to come live at his home, Greville Lodge. Great Uncle seems to be a man of few words, and James finds himself intrigued by the old house. He is taken care of by Sarah the housekeeper (Prunella Scales) who seems to know more than she lets on. Over a period of time, James becomes convinced that the house is haunted, and sees a man in shadows watching him, as well as hears strange noises. James is determined to investigate the source of the hauntings, an endeavour that literally takes him back to the past, in 1945, which reveals some dark secrets at Greville Lodge, one that involves both Sarah and Great Uncle, and James may well be the key to unlocking those secrets and finally laying those ghosts of the past to rest.

I loved the story, especially the way the story takes its time unfolding (some may consider it rather plodding) and the slow build up of atmosphere and suspense. The actors have done a credible job in their respective roles - newcomers, as well as veteran actors bring depth to their characters and this results in a fine production. My main complaint is the audio and picture quality - the sound is not altogether clear, and the picture quality is reminiscent of movies made in the 70s where the images lack sharpness and clarity. Other than that, this is a wonderful ghost story, perfect for families.",1260144000,6,1787,4.566978193146418

8372274,4,B002KVSJ6Y,"Orphaned teenager James Greville (John Newman) travels to his Great Uncle's sprawling and rather secluded English countryside manor to spend the holidays with him.  After inadvertently over-hearing conversations between manor staff about the restless ghosts of the manor, James decides to explore the manor to see whether or not the rumors about it being haunted are true.  His explorations ultimately lead to the discovery a long sealed-off wing that proves to hold haunting secrets about both the Greville Family and the Lodge itself.
