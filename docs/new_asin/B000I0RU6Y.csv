Typical reality show hokum is kept to a minimum, and you only ocasionally see trip-ups in the series' attempt at a period experience.  The participants are likable and their journey impressive.  If you are a fan of R.M. Ballantyne, Isaac Cowie, or other chroniclers of the Hudson's Bay Company of the 19th Century, this series will put images to their words.  If you are a reenactor or living history presenter, you will find small things to pick at, but generally a high standard set for an enveloping living history experience.  This is a fine series and one well worth adding to any collection of historical films.",1272844800,3,819,4.73943661971831
8142972,5,B000I0RU6Y,"This is the absoulte best reality tv production ever put together. The adventure this group of people go through is astonishing and unbelievable. This blows away the productions by PBS like ""Frontier House"".  Puts CBS's ""Survivor"" to shame! ""Frontier House"" was good in it's own right, but this is a EPIC ADVENTURE not too be missed. It would be great to see others go through what this group did in a new production. Not many would be able to make it. It's amazing that this group did seeing all the stuff they had to contend with and endure. They should all be very proud of their accomplishments. This is ""Survivor"" times 10 without the stupid games & challenges. This is for TRUE survivors of the wilderness and a great tribute to what the fur traders & mountain men had to suffer through in great detail in history. The best thing about this production was that the producers and crew refused to help otu what so ever in the adventure these people had to endure and accomplish. Truley astonisihing reality tv at it's best with a great history lesson. Thanks to the production staff & crew and people that were part of this show. I watch this over & over every year and still enjoy it. Now I'm going to get me a copy on DVD. Can't wait to see the scenery in all it's gradure. My VHS tape I taped from tv is getting worn out. To adventure seekers and people that like to watch expiditions filled with REAL TRUE adventure & mountain scenry & historians, don't miss out on seeing this show!!!",1250294400,2,1493,4.468864468864469
