8014984,5,B0001N7R4S,"The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!
Sweet voice, sweet lips
Soft hand, and softer breast,
Warm breath, light whisper, tender semitone,
Bright eyes, accomplish'd shape and lang'rous waist!
Faded the flower and all its budded charms.
Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes.
Faded the shape of beauty from my arms.
Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise. . .
Vanish'd unseasonably at the shut of eve.  John Keats

1979 Jon Kabat Zinn established the Chronic Pain Clinic which continues to help patients who have not been helped by traditional medicine. The video follows a new class in which Bill Moyers participates through the entire 8 weeks, in two and half hour weekly classes and practice 45minutes per day at home. Part 3 is an introduction to the Chronic Pain Clinic and Mindfulness Meditation as taught by Jon Kabat Zinn author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Using-the-Wisdom-of-Your-Body-and-Mind-to-Face-Stress-Pain-and-Illness/dp/0385303122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wherever-You-Go-There-You-Are-Mindfulness-Mediation-in-Everyday-Life/dp/1567319920/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wherever You Go, There You Are : Mindfulness Mediation in Everyday Life</a>.

The current issue of SCIENCE Journal of American Association for Advancement of Science deals with violence and concludes that unexamined self perceived altruistic action on behalf of ""victims"" by educated, rational people results in crimes against humanity.

Buddhist practice focuses on falling awake, through two behaviors, awareness in the moment and meditation. No beliefs, two actions to DO. Buddhist icons are not dieties, the icons are semiotic representations of states of awareness, visual reminders of empathy (Guan Yin the female embodiment of compassion), being awake (male Buddha), patience, beginner's mind, trust, nonjudging, nonstriving, acceptance, letting go. The goal of Mindfulness Meditation is to notice where you are now and not miss this precious moment; to make the effort to pay attention as if your life mattered.

The second half of Part 3 follows David Spiegel MD of Stanford and women with metastatic breast cancer who are part of a Meditative support group vs wait list control subjects. Dr Spiegel did a preliminary study which showed that those who participated in the Meditative support group lived twice as long as those who received care as usual. This replication study involves women who candidly express their fears, sorrows, sense of isolation through denial ""showing a good face"" to family and the outside world.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Proof/dp/B001TKNWV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Proof</a>

For you to be successful, sacrifices must be made. It's better that they are made by others, but failing that, you'll have to make them yourself. Rita Mae Brown

Part 3 is a non-instrumental approach to healing without cure. The discipline of nondoing requires attention, awareness, effort to being in this moment through Mindfulness Meditation

The time will come when you will, with elation, greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror and each will smile at the other's welcome and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was yourself. . . .
give back your heart to the stranger who has loved you all your life. . . .
Sit.
Feast on your life.  Derek Walcott",1339372800,2,7756,6.896938775510204
