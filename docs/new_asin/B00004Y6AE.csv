1371982,5,B00004Y6AE,"I have two videos, this one and the Living Arts prenatal video.  I found the exercises in this video to be easier, and chose this one on days when just wanted some light exercise.  The video is fun, efficient, and relaxing.  The stretching exercises definitely made me feel better.",988243200,,281,4.6938775510204085
1371983,4,B00004Y6AE,"This video was not too strenuous.  I have another prenatal video which i found to be a little tiring (but that could be because i was doing it in my first trimester).  I am now in my third trimester and find after this video i am stretched and relaxed.  In addition, I think it is helping to reduce the back pain i have been waking up with in the middle of the night.  I like to see the modified poses for the days when i am not quite myself.  The only thing i am not too keen on is seeing the instructors cleavage when she is leaning forward...i know it is nice to finally have cleavage, but save it for your husband :)",987379200,,620,4.008130081300813
1372004,3,B00004Y6AE,"To be honest, I was not able to use this product as I would have liked.  I had pregnancy issues that kept me from exercising as I would have liked.  However, I did watch this dvd and I believe that if I had been able to participate in the workout, I would have really liked it and used it as much as possible.",1437523200,,309,3.888888888888889

1372006,3,B00004Y6AE,Good workout. Just the video was a little too outdated for me.,1436227200,,62,4.25

1372008,4,B00004Y6AE,Overall a pretty good yoga DVD but very slow and not a lot of poses. This would be good for the last trimester or for someone who hasn't really done yoga before because it's not very challenging.,1433808000,,195,4.297297297297297
1372009,3,B00004Y6AE,This DVD moves very slowly with a little too much talking for me. I didn't like it.,1433462400,,83,3.9411764705882355
1372010,3,B00004Y6AE,"eh, this DVD was nice, but it was a little dated and could be a bit cheesy at times (but aren't all yoga videos that way?).  Although, it was nice that they had women in all stages of pregnancy to show you how to modify the positions, if needed.",1430956800,,245,4.0
1372011,5,B00004Y6AE,"I'm not a yogi by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed this prenatal yoga DVD. It wasn't a workout that was going to make me sweat, but the stretching and different poses helped me feel better throughout pregnancy, especially in the later weeks when I was aching.",1429142400,,262,4.595744680851064
1372012,4,B00004Y6AE,I like it- other reviewers are right when saying it is not challenging. I use it between workout days as it ends up giving me a good stretch! Her jokes are cheesy but there are only a few so they don't bother me. I would buy again.,1422835200,,231,3.9361702127659575
1372013,5,B00004Y6AE,Have always loved Crunch videos. I really like the fact that I can use this after I deliver to ease my body back into my routine!,1422316800,,129,4.0
1372022,4,B00004Y6AE,Great workout that I could do even being plus sized and pregnant.,1421712000,,65,4.5
1372023,2,B00004Y6AE,Boring.... I really wanted an invigorating baby mama workout and this wasn't it.,1420070400,,80,5.230769230769231
1372024,5,B00004Y6AE,"I enjoy doing this yoga video when I'm pregnant. It's minimally cheesy which I appreciate as someone who enjoys yoga but doesn't LOVE yoga like some people do. It always leaves me feeling very relaxed and stretched out and feeling great. I love that all stages of pregnancy are shown, and different body types and that they show ways to modify some of the poses",1419638400,,361,4.569230769230769
1372025,2,B00004Y6AE,Nor a fan. I will be the first to admit that I am not a yoga girl to begin with so I don't know why I had such an itch to start when I got pregnant. Sore achy hips and back I guess. I found it really corny all the way through and quickly realized it was not for me. I think I would be better off learning some good stretches and doing them to my own music at my own (much faster) pace.,1416182400,,385,3.5952380952380953
1372026,2,B00004Y6AE,"This is a good workout for people who begin pregnancy NEVER EXERCISING EVER. If you are one of those people who want to start exercising after getting pregnant, and the doctor says it is not safe to begin a new routine if you are not already in the habit of exercising, this is a good dvd for you. It is slow and easy. There are like twenty women in the dvd following the instructor and several of them look overweight. All this is good for someone overweight and not used to exercising.

If you are relatively fit (and I do not call myself really fit, I am adequate right now at 29 weeks according to my own standards) then do not get this dvd. It is way too easy. Also, the positions have been modified out of yoga existence. I am not a yoga expert by any means, but these poses just seemed like different ways of laying on the floor, some not even recognizable as poses that I am familiar with anyway.

It is also too long for me. With two children already, I want something about twenty minutes long. This may not be a problem for some, however.

So, it is not a bad dvd per se; it is just not what I needed. I will give my copy away as soon as I find someone appropriate to give it to.",1414540800,,1190,4.098712446351931
1372027,5,B00004Y6AE,"I started this DVD early in pregnancy and enjoyed it, but didn't realize until later how truly  great it really is. I had a lot of hip pain in my third trimester and this DVD helped stretch that area out a relieve some of the pain. I had been borrowing a friend's but am now buying it for a postnatal workout!",1413504000,,309,4.065573770491803
1372028,5,B00004Y6AE,This video was a little too easy in the beginning of my pregnancy but by the middle and end it was perfect. It was a great help in stretching and strengthening my sore back.,1409702400,,173,4.117647058823529
1372029,5,B00004Y6AE,This is my second pregnancy using this DVD.  It helps me stretch and feel limber.  I also feel it creates more space for my baby and I don't feel so cramped as well.,1407628800,,165,3.9696969696969697
1372030,4,B00004Y6AE,"good prenatal video, but would be boring for anyone not pregnant.",1407024000,,65,5.0
1372031,5,B00004Y6AE,"I love how easy this is to do.  I also love the included modifications which are great for a beginner such as myself and for the later stages of pregnancy.  I continue to use this even after pregnancy because it is such a great workout.  This is gentle and effective for building strength, deep breathing, and relaxation.",1405900800,,321,4.5964912280701755

1372042,5,B00004Y6AE,This has been a great yoga video so far. I think all of the poses are great for any trimester. She holds to poses for an appropriate amount of time to make them effective.,1403395200,,171,4.0588235294117645
1372043,5,B00004Y6AE,Just what my wife was looking for. It's easy for her to do and she recommends it to anyone who asks.,1396396800,,100,3.8095238095238093
1372044,5,B00004Y6AE,"This is the perfect prenatal exercise video, as far as I'm concerned. It works on stretches and strengthening. It is not weird and spiritual or overly cute and obnoxious. It is gentle relaxing and very very helpful in terms of feeling good throughout your pregnancy. I have used it during all 4 of mine and I can say that I feel much better and more comfortable when I practice this yoga than when I do not.",1396224000,,407,4.368421052631579
1372045,3,B00004Y6AE,"I'm not super into yoga, and not super strong, so I went with a DVD I thought would be my pace. This is actually not challenging at all. However, I am using it on days when I don't feel like exercising, as I'm still getting some physical activity and it does make a really nice stretching/flexibility routine - easily done in 1/2 hour or so if I skip the breathing exercises at the beginning.",1392422400,,392,4.3108108108108105
1372046,4,B00004Y6AE,"This DVD is good for days you want to relax, stretch, and restore your body. I bought this hoping it would be challenging, so instead I use it for days that I want a light workout/ between harder workout days.",1392076800,,209,4.25
1372047,3,B00004Y6AE,"I liked the yoga moves in this workout; however, the video was very short and didn't have much variety.  A lot of time is spent doing things like taking deep breaths and sending positive vibes to the baby, which isn't something I was looking for.  I just want to add a little flexibility to my large prego self!",1391990400,,311,4.344827586206897
1372048,4,B00004Y6AE,"This video is not the most challenging workout I have ever had, but is just right for my needs right now. When I first started using it I was about 5 1/2 months pregnant. I had not been working out at ALL in the first part of my pregnancy due to nausea, fatigue and busy schedule at work.  Before I was pregnant I was in pretty good shape with a few years of yoga experience so I could hold my own in an intermediate class, but was certainly not an expert, and definitely not very flexible.
If I were not pregnant, this video would be laughably too easy, but it is just perfect for what I needed. I was afraid to take a real in person prenatal yoga class because I was so far out of practice I was nervous it would be too much.  This video was easy to follow, there were always modifications available, and the stretches felt helpful.  The next day I felt mild soreness so I know it worked, but nothing too bad.  Once I start using it for a while I will probably be ready to move onto something harder or perhaps a live class, but it is a great place to start.",1389398400,,1060,4.081730769230769
1372049,2,B00004Y6AE,The pace was much too slow for me. I have done yoga before and this just didn't live up to my expectations. MAYBE if you are very big (preggers wise) and having a hard time exercising this would be a good option.,1389052800,,212,4.071428571428571
1372050,5,B00004Y6AE,It's great for beginners or intermediates. My wife liked it a lot and she is not very athletic but it helped her to meditate and focus,1388707200,,134,4.1923076923076925
1372071,5,B00004Y6AE,"I love this prenatal yoga work-out routine. I think it's about 45 minutes long and combines a variety of standing and sitting exercises. She ends with a nice, calming meditation. They also have options for modified exercises, depending on your abilities at the time.",1386979200,,266,5.068181818181818
1372072,5,B00004Y6AE,"Doesn't even feel like a 45 minute workout.  Relaxing, and easy on the body.  Explains yoga, and a breathing technique for labor.",1384819200,,129,4.818181818181818
1372073,3,B00004Y6AE,I would say this should be for beginners.  I don't even normally do yoga (cardio and weights and some pilates) but found this to be too easy.  It might be nice the last few weeks of pregnancy.,1384387200,,192,4.162162162162162
1372074,3,B00004Y6AE,"I had been a fairly active person before and into my pregnancy - running and swimming several times a week, and I was used to doing active yoga videos too.  This yoga workout seems safe for pregnancy and gave me a good stretch, but it did not provide any real workout for me - and no satisfying feeling of having worked out afterward.  I guess if you aren't used to working out at all-- or if your pregnancy is just really hard and you're tired as hell -- this might feel like exercise. But I had hoped that it would be a bit more challenging.  I also tried the Summer Sanders prenatal workout and it was much more what I was looking for - you can modify when you're feeling more or less energetic, but there is still the option of having a real workout.",1380931200,,754,4.186206896551724
1372075,4,B00004Y6AE,"I've been doing yoga on-and-off for a few years but I haven't done much yoga in the past year.  When I became pregnant, I wanted to find a prenatal yoga video to help me relax and stretch.  This video is just what I was looking for.  It is very slow-paced, so more experienced yogis will probably find this boring or not challenging enough.  As with any yoga video, previous yoga experience is beneficial, but not necessarily required.  Some of the verbal cues and imagery would definitely make more sense to someone who has taken a few classes already. I do wish they included more stretches for the thighs and a few more hip-openers.  But overall, if you're looking for a slow, easy, relaxing yoga practice to use throughout your pregnancy, this is a good video.",1379376000,,764,4.622222222222222
1372076,4,B00004Y6AE,"Enjoy the stretches but not challenging enough to do everyday.  I do it about once a week, maybe will do more in 3rd trimester.",1377475200,,127,4.291666666666667
1372077,1,B00004Y6AE,The woman goes through way too slow. I am not an expert yoga person. I was annoyed with her instruction the whole way through. She took to long to explain a pose and move on to the next. The description does not portray the video efficiently.,1377388800,,242,4.282608695652174
1372078,1,B00004Y6AE,Didn't get through many poses at all. Lots of time spent on just getting into a pose. Also the instructor's laughing at her own (not funny) comments was some what distracting/annoying.,1375315200,,184,4.967741935483871
1372079,3,B00004Y6AE,"Kind of thought the dvd would be a bit longer. Not very challenging yoga, but hey it is a yoga video",1374796800,,100,3.8095238095238093
1372080,4,B00004Y6AE,"I am not really big into yoga, but this video was pretty enjoyable. I don't feel like you get a super great workout from it, but you do feel very relaxed and stretched out after.",1374710400,,178,4.114285714285714
1372104,3,B00004Y6AE,"I am an avid work out guru, so this video was ok,  but I prefer fast more intense work outs. This is actually probably more suitable for pregnancy, but I did find it boring for someone who is used to high intensity, fast paced, heavy lifting workouts.",1374537600,,251,4.340425531914893
1372105,5,B00004Y6AE,"The workout is great no matter what stage of pregnancy you're in.  It works to maintain (or increase) flexibility, balance and breathing. And they have modifications if needed.",1374537600,,176,5.285714285714286
1372106,5,B00004Y6AE,"I really enjoy this DVD. I do yoga mainly for my back pain and I am about 4 1/2 months pregnant, so a few normal yoga tapes are getting uncomfortable for me (lying on my stomach a lot, etc). This DVD is very gentle, I did not break a sweat but I am not doing it for an intense workout. I found it to be very comfortable for all the positions and my back feels better already, I also find it relaxing and good for stress relief. If you are looking for a great workout, you are not going to find it here, but you will find a nice gentle yoga DVD good for stretching, relaxation and stress relief. Also probably a good program for people VERY new to yoga. I have enjoyed all the CRUNCH fitness videos that I have tried, all are excellent.",1372204800,,735,4.075862068965518
1372107,4,B00004Y6AE,This a good prenatal DVD. The instructor is soothing and calm but not boring. The moves are modified so you should be able to use it your entire pregnancy.,1372032000,,155,4.379310344827586
1372108,5,B00004Y6AE,"I first found this workout on Netflix and was streaming it online, then they took it away from online streaming. I was so sad! I was happy to find it on Amazon. I'm not an athletic person at all, and most workouts are a little much for me. I can go through it no problem, but get super sore for the next 4 days. This one, I was able to handle and loved it before I got pregnant. It was still enough to challenge me, but not enough to exhaust me. I tried it again after having my baby, and it kicked my butt. Now that the babes is older, I will try and use this to ease into a routine",1371772800,,583,3.8264462809917354
1372109,5,B00004Y6AE,"Being in the early stages of pregnancy, having a work out routine that is built for me helps with allot of the aches and pains",1370304000,,126,4.08
1372110,4,B00004Y6AE,"At about 5 1/2 months I tried out this yoga video alongside Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett. In comparison, I find this video more accessible to beginners. The poses are fairly easy to do and especially focus on strengthening and opening up the hips.

Initially, I rented this video through Amazon Instant Video, and then my boyfriend purchased the DVD for me.

I'm now at about 32 weeks and about a month ago started experiencing severe pain in my left hip, which I suspect was due to the fact that the increased baby weight and relaxation of ligaments knocked something out of joint. I went to the chiropractor twice in one week, but the best adjustment to fix the problem would normally involve lying on my stomach, which I can't do at this point. Posters to an online discussion board indicated they'd found yoga to be incredibly helpful for managing hip pain.

I've been doing this yoga video every day for the past month. I do it first thing in the morning, and follow it up with a 20-30 minute soak in a warm tub to loosen the muscles in my hip joint. After about 7-10 days I found that my hip pain had begun to decrease. The pain I experienced made walking painful, and walking up stairs was excruciating, even if I supported myself using a handrail. Before the hip pain began to subside with the yoga I was walking with a very pronounced limp, and began to experience pain in my mid-back and right shoulder due to how my body was compensating for the extreme limp.

After about another week I was able to walk up stairs with minimal discomfort. Now, I can walk up stairs without any discomfort at all. My hip muscles are still a bit stiff from time to time, but I attribute this to the fact that my pelvis is 12mm shorter on the left side than on the right side, and the stiffness is about the same as I experienced when I was still running regularly. I've found that my posture has improved, especially below the waist, so that I have very little low back pain. Additionally, I've found that my stance has improved so that I my feet don't roll inward as much when I'm walking. My improved stance has decreased knee strain as well.

The only reason that I gave this video 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the instructor's commentary throughout the video. Some of the commentary is in regards to how our bodies change during pregnancy and how various poses can help with the resulting discomforts of those changes; this I found to be helpful and informative. Other commentary is more editorial (""Look down at your feet... I know, it's getting harder every day! or We gladly carry this extra baby weight around!) and gets on my nerves when I'm hearing it every day; admittedly, that has more to do with my own attitude than with the quality of the video.

An additional observation before I close this review: I wish that this video repeated some of the poses, especially the standing poses, because I don't always feel like I get the stretch I need in key areas of my hips; I can solve this by pausing the video to repeat the poses. If the poses were indeed repeated at least one additional time, then the video would probably be about an hour long instead of just under 45 minutes. When I do desire more time with specific poses I will switch to Desi Bartlett's yoga video mentioned at the beginning of the review. That video and those poses provide a yoga session with more repetition of poses and that is a bit more intense than this one.

UPDATE, January 5, 2013

I can't speak empirically as to how much impact this video had in helping ease my birthing experience, but I wanted to share a few (very general, relatively non-graphic) details about my birth experience and the use of this DVD.

I used this yoga routine right up until I gave birth, which happened about two weeks early. I was at work on Friday and my water broke the next morning while I was making breakfast. About two weeks prior to this, and during each of my weekly checkups I was about 2.5 cm dilated and my ob/gyn predicted I would likely not have to worry about going past my due date. This was my first child and I had heard in childbirth education classes that most women on average spend at least 16 hours in labor with their first child. My water broke at about 10:30 am and we were at the hospital within two hours. I was given a low dose of pitocin because I was barely having any contractions even though my water had broken.

Once the pitocin began to kick in, I was in labor for about eight hours, and in hard labor for only about 20 minutes before my daughter was born. At one point while I was pushing I reached down and was able to grab my own feet to assist in the pushing, instead of having my feet held for me. This blew the attending ob/gyn away, who said she'd never seen an eight and a half month pregnant woman do such a thing.

There are a myriad factors that come into play that have an impact on how long a woman will be in labor, especially with the first child. Although I don't have another personal birthing experience to compare it to, I do think that the yoga poses in this DVD made for a somewhat easier birthing experience than I would have otherwise had, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who was pregnant.",1369699200,2,5233,4.395661157024794
1372111,5,B00004Y6AE,"I bought this for my wife, she loves it, she thinks it is the bestest yoga for pregnant ladies, that she has ever tried.",1369008000,,120,4.041666666666667
1372112,5,B00004Y6AE,"This video is super old, but I really liked it. It's easy to do while preggo. I didn't really get the relaxing thing, but it does help strengthen you.",1368662400,,150,4.206896551724138
1372113,4,B00004Y6AE,My wife wanted me to purchase this for her and she really enjoyed it.  It helped relieve a lot of pain and some possible swelling in her feet. There wasn't a day that she did it that wasn't a good feeling day for her.  It isn't physically intense and doesn't take a ton of time.  My wife is an intermediate yoga doer and she found this to be a great way for her to continue her yoga through the pregnancy.,1366588800,,405,4.0375
1372124,4,B00004Y6AE,"I use this video at home when I am too tired to get out and go to the gym.  It focuses on stretching and uses basic yoga poses- downward dog, mountain, childs pose, etc.  If you can do these on your own, you do not need this video. I like it because it sets a pace for myself and allows me to dedicate 30-40 mins of stretching/ yoga.  If I tried to do yoga on my own without an instructor, I would rush through everything and get on with life.  The video helps you pace and spend the time you need to stretch different problem areas for pregnant women.",1365724800,,552,4.036697247706422
1372125,2,B00004Y6AE,"While not a stickler for perfect dialogue from a yoga instructor, in this case, I simply couldn't get past the cheesy, staged pregnancy humor. I mean, if the yoga workout itself would have been excellent, I would stomach it. But special pregnancy sun salutes and repeating down dogs, don't get me there. Most importantly, if a pregnancy woman is to avoid inverted poses, why are there 3 down dogs in the first 5 minutes?! It was an uncomfortable experience in every way for me.",1364860800,,477,4.690476190476191
1372126,4,B00004Y6AE,"This is pretty decent. It has an 80's vibe that you either appreciate or have to get over. The class is a bit short, which can be good, but may leave you not feeling totally worked out. Doing this DVD did really, REALLLY help with my low back pain. If you're a hard core yogi, this probably isn't for you, but if you're a intermediate/noob looking to feel good it will give you that.",1364774400,,383,4.1891891891891895
1372127,5,B00004Y6AE,"I am 23 weeks pregnant and I started doing the workout in this video when I was about 18-20 weeks pregnant. I've done yoga before and I'm very fit (within the limits of being pregnant).

 I'm definitely not looking for a ""tough workout"" when I do yoga while pregnant--I'm looking to stretch my tight muscles, to open up my pelvic area for delivery and, yes, to get the blood flowing. This video does all these things. In fact, it's more challenging than two other videos I tried (Yoga Zone pregnancy poses through Hulu and Yoga Pregnancy: Pre- and Post-natal workouts). Additionally, the instructor is not annoying at all (which unfortunately is an issue with a lot of pregnancy yoga videos)--she seems down to Earth, sweet, and encouraging. I feel great after doing this video. I recommend it!",1363910400,,794,4.788321167883212
1372128,2,B00004Y6AE,"I bought this based on reading some reviews, and didn't like it.  I felt the pacing was too fast, and quite a few of the moves can be risky for a pregnant woman, like downward dog.  One plus is that there's a room full of pregnant women demonstrating, showing every trimester.  I found the instructor annoying though, a little too new-age for me and corny.  I like the ""Yoga for Pregnancy"" by Theresa Jamieson much better.  Glad I only paid less than $10 for this because I only used it once and probably won't again.",1363910400,,517,4.4

I would have at least done it on the days I didn't feel good or was 8 or 9 mo. pregnant, but the woman who hosts it is so annoying and chatty that I didn't even want to listen to her.",1361836800,,344,3.8309859154929575
1372131,2,B00004Y6AE,"I got pregnant during my college's volleyball season, which is to say I was in really good shape. I got sick at six weeks and am now, at 19 weeks, finally having more good days than bad days. But it's been important to me to maintain my strength and endurance, so I've been forcing myself to work out a few days a week.

I tried this program today because I wasn't feeling up to my usual workout routine. I thought it'd be relaxing and grounding. But I just found the dialogue distracting and confusing -- when she directed me to look down at my belly, up at the ceiling, or down at my supporting leg, she didn't direct the movement in a way I could follow. I have never had very much flexibility in my wrists and fingers (which pregnancy hasn't helped) and there were a lot of poses I couldn't do, even with the suggested modifications. I finally gave up. The disc is still playing, while I'm sitting on my couch writing this review. I doubt I will do this routine again.",1361232000,,972,4.311475409836065

The moves have helped my lower back pain, and it feels wonderful to stretch out. The most challenging move this video offers is the ""on all fours push up"" and there aren't that many reps. There are women in the video in all trimesters of pregnancy, and one that modifies all the moves if they are too challenging. The instructor's voice is soothing and does a wonderful job of teaching the moves.",1359763200,,514,4.364583333333333

I am in my 3rd trimester so I am really looking for DVDs that will stretch me out and prepare me for labor without being too intense or too easy.  At first, I was not a huge fan of this DVD because the production quality is a little poor and it is pretty dated and the teacher is a little irritating but I found that I just kept wanting to do it every day instead of the other videos I have.

The great thing about this video that I didn't find in some of the other prenatal yoga videos is that it is very thorough, stretching out pretty much every part of your body, and it is only 35 minutes.  I have tried Shiva Rea's prenatal video and it is about 50 minutes and I feel like it doesn't stretch me out quite as well.  Also, although the teacher is kind of cheesey, it isn't that zen, yoga cheesiness that Shiva Rea does that kind of grates on me.

Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite prenatal yoga videos and it's pretty cheap so it's worth a purchase.  It's nice and short and effective for stretching everything out daily.",1358640000,,1150,4.107142857142857

I started using this at the end of my 1st trimester after morning sickness subsided.  I'm in fairly good shape: pre-pregnancy I was lifting heavy weights and doing regular Crossfit workouts.  But I stopped doing any exercise during my 1st trimester (just too sick & tired).  So this DVD was a great re-introduction into exercise.  I've really enjoyed it.  Yes, it is a little corny - What DVD workout isn't? But it's not annoying.  It's a soothing, relaxing workout.

All the women in the DVD have late2nd/3rd trimester bellies.  One participant even shows you how to modify each movement if you're less flexible or your belly is too big.  I plan on using this every other day just to relax and stay flexible.",1353628800,,861,4.875862068965517

1372167,3,B00004Y6AE,"This video was basically an easy take on a few familiar yoga poses. There was not a strong focus on ways the poses help the body during pregnancy, labor/delivery. It was basically just a handful of pregnant women in a room doing some asanas together. Maybe my expectations were a bit higher b/c I have been practicing yoga for several years and have taken a few prenatal classes. It is a good DVD to do to help keep active but I wouldn't rely soley on it throughout my pregnancy.",1343433600,,479,4.393258426966292
1372168,4,B00004Y6AE,"Let me preface this by saying that if I had tried this video earlier in my pregnancy I would have scoffed at how easy it was. But the tail end of my pregnancy has been a bit uncomfortable and limiting and I feel like this video is geared towards women who are having a similar experience. Before this pregnancy, I had practiced yoga for years and was suprised during my first and second trimesters that it just didn't feel good to me anymore (I had a lot of nausea which was distracting/frustrating in some poses.)I enjoyed lap swimming instead. Now, as I near the end of my pregnancy, I am finding it more and more difficult to go to all the work of fitting swim time into my day although once I'm in the pool, it feels incredibly good. I decided to give this workout a chance.

The pros:
Lots of hip opening exercises
Touches on the importance of kegels
Very gentle on the rather delicate pregnant joints
Will definitely not risk raising your heart rate too much
Would be excellent for the Mama who isn't used to yoga, has spent a lot of time on the couch recently or is starting to feel uncomfortable and/or limited in what they can readily do.
A good emphasis on breathing

The cons:
She does talk a bit too much for me - I'd rather focus on settling into the stretches.  Next time I do this, I'll mute her and put on some soothing music I think.
She doesn't mention hydration and there isn't a water bottle in sight which isn't directly related to yoga but is very important during pregnancy and I was surprised it didn't come up in a wellness video.
It seemed rather short.  While there were some very helpful poses included, I didn't feel like we spent enough time in any of them to reap the full benefit. But being short is also a pro so I suppose it depends on what you're looking for.

All in all, I will still use this video when I'm crunched for time and want a quick relaxing stretch with my baby because it is better than no workout and my body isn't up for much more intensity at this point.",1342569600,,2006,4.296296296296297

She doesn't use a bazillion props or take forever to set up every pose like some prenatal yoga dvds I have used, which is nice.

The narrator, bless her, falls prey to a common mistake - talking to pregnant women as though they had the emotional maturity of the children in their bellies.  LOTS of people do this.  I have no idea why, I don't recall regressing emotionally in my first pregnancy, and was hormonal enough to want to bite peoples' heads off for doing it.

1. While there were women in all stages of pregnancy and she says you can ""modify as needed"", she doesn't tell you who you should watch for each trimester and only once gives a specific modification example.
2. The flow of the exercises is uneven and doesn't flow the way a yoga class normally would.
3. The music is clubby and not a good fit for yoga.
4. Not great directions for poses.

I think that Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea is muuucchhh better. She continually gives gentle guidance and suggestions for comfort, no matter your stage. It's challenging, but feels good after.",1295568000,,682,4.779661016949152

There are examples of every trimester in the video with good ideas on how to modify for a less strenuous workout.

1372300,5,B00004Y6AE,"I used this DVD nearly everyday of my pregnancy(first child).  It is very relaxing provides just enough of the appropriate conditioning for someone who is preparing to give birth.

The squatting pose felt a little silly to me, but I was so grateful for it during labor.  My daughter was born with her hand on her head and her elbow next to her ear.  I had to do some serious squatting to avoid a c-section, and I believe this DVD was essential in preparing me.

My pregnancy was great - my weight gain was text book, I never had any back pain or any swelling, I did get some leg cramps, but only if I skipped a workout - I really think this DVD played a huge roll in how comfortable I was during pregnancy.

When I was pregnant, I thought the fact that this comes from Crunch indicates it should be more challenging.  Take my advice, when you're pregnant you don't need challenging you need relaxing.  This DVD will help you maintain your physical fitness and prepare you for birth.",1231372800,,982,4.386740331491713

She makes suggestions about pregnancy and labor-related things, and giggles as she says them, like she's insecure about what she says so she can't act serious about it. I appreciated the variety of body types shown and that they had a woman doing the poses in a modified manner. I found the whole atmosphere to be too ""hip gym"", rather than relaxing, meditative yoga. I also found the workout to be too easy, with very little focus on the all-important Kegels. I much prefer Shiva Rea's yoga workout.",1230595200,,564,4.707070707070707

I noticed that when I was consistent with the yoga, my back hurt less and the pressure was eased on my bottom...it even relieved the hemorrhoids!  When I wasn't consistent, the back problems and the rhoids returned.

I will say this, when I first tried this video, I thought it was kind of lame and that the moves really didn't do much for me...I was SO wrong.

Although I love the CD, I did not rate it with 5 stars because it is a little slow and there's too much hippy talk. But I totally recommend this CD.",1224547200,,663,4.069230769230769

The DVD shows you how to properly breath, relieves stress and aches/pains associated with an expanding body.  Its focus on overall wellness during pregnancy, including listening to your body on a day-by-day basis.

1372321,3,B00004Y6AE,"WHAT I LIKE
- I am a beginner and I found that I can follow the exercises without looking at the TV.
- When she says bend to the right she means your right so you can copy her easily as she bends to her left.
- There are about 6 women of all different body shapes behind the instructor which I like because I don't want to look at all slim, flexible women while I am getting bigger and bigger!
- A pleasant and friendly instructor with a nice voice (although her top gapes a little when she bends over in front of the camera. Nothing obscene in the slightest and when she is standing you would not think anything of it. It's just a little thing I noticed that I though was odd).
- The stretches are comfortable.
- Background music is pleasant and soft enough to go unnoticed
- The set is OK, modern, nothing special, nothing irritating to look at repeatedly.
- I do not find her phrases irritating even though she always tells you to look down at your belly, when I'd be happy to forget about my belly for a few minutes and simply be told to look down.
I enjoy doing the DVD but am going to buy another one as this one gets a bit boring because...
WHAT I DO NOT LIKE SO MUCH
- The actual stretches are really, really spaced out because the instructor talks in between them. She usually gives instructions for modifying the stretch and things like that but I think you spend half of the tape just standing waiting for the next stretch. I hold the stretch longer or do an extra set and make sure I have the remote close by and fast forward between each stretch. Yes, the inactive parts really are long enough that it is worth fast forwarding!
- The instructor LOVES downward facing dog pose. I'm sure it is great for ""creating space for the baby"" (her favorite phrase) but it gets really tedious to do the same pose over and over and over. Last night I found myself wincing every time she said to fold in half from standing or straighten your legs from being on all fours.

Ths is very gentle and the instructor is pleasant. I find it very easy and relaxing to switch on this DVD after a long day at work. I recomend the DVD but be aware that although it runs 45min, you can get it done in 30min if you fast forward the inactive parts between streches.",1201737600,8,2250,4.208333333333333
1372342,5,B00004Y6AE,"I loved this dvd!  I alternated between this and a prenatal cardio dvd for my last trimester.  I used to do a lot of yoga so I was a bit nervous as to how I would like this.  But the instructor was great and the poses were simple but effective.  The stretching/poses really helped with some of my leg cramps and lower back pain.  If I went a few days without doing this tape, I could definitely tell.  It is a great buy (plus my fave part was at the end when the instructor had you lay down for a while - nice getaway from the real world).",1201046400,,539,3.9444444444444446

1372345,3,B00004Y6AE,This video was just okay. It is a little long especially with being very pregnant and if you are a busy woman takes more time than I think it is worth. The instructor is somewhat hard to listen to and there are a lot of instructions to try and hear while you are putting yourself in these crazy positions. If you have done yoga for a long time or regularly it will probably be just fine for you.,1183852800,,395,4.076923076923077

I almost fall asleep at the end of the tape because I am so relaxed. Be careful if you are new to Yoga - I am, and I twisted some muscles out of whack in my back a few times.  I find if I just stretch to MY comfort level and not try to imitate the actors, then it really helps.  Pace is great, and moves are explained in enough detail that you don't have to look up at all while in a pose.  Highly recommend!",1182988800,,551,3.981818181818182

The teacher talks through almost every pose, even when there is nothing critical to describe, which I find distracting.  Her rehearsed commentary is a bit too fru-fru for me.",1180310400,,332,4.593220338983051
1372348,4,B00004Y6AE,"I read a lot of customer reviews before deciding on this video. I wanted something to soothe my back, but having moderate yoga experience, I wanted something a little challenging (but not much). I am happy with this video. It really helps my back, and I feel that it offers some challenge in that I feel like I'm working my body. I've never cracked a sweat, but that's fine with my goals. I'm just trying to avoid the painfully rusty feelings of pregnancy.

For those new to yoga, the poses are explained thoroughly, and modifications are presented. There are women in the video who are at all stages of pregnancy, and the instructor herself is pregnant.

My only quibble: the instructor's presentation style. I'm not looking for the mystical Om-Namaste spiritual counselor, but this instructor leans heavily toward the girlfrennn/sorority sister vibe. She's trying to be reassuring and natural, ending a lot of her instructions with forced giggles. It just doesn't do it for me, but it's easy to overlook because I enjoy the video otherwise.

Some wrote about too much Down-Dog in this video. I personally didn't find it excessive, and I've had my share of carpal tunnel problems in this pregnancy. Regardless, modifications are offered to help those with wrist problems.",1180224000,,1272,4.962441314553991

1372350,4,B00004Y6AE,"Overall I find this an enjoyable yoga session, one of my favorites. Particularly good if you are new to yoga because they show many variations for those who are less flexible and they are careful to point out that you should only go as far as your body lets you. I would recommend this video if you are looking for increased flexibility, relaxation and inner peace, and a spiritual connection to your unborn baby - not a challenging workout, however. I began doing this video in preparation for pregnancy, continued throughout my pregnancy, and still do it on days when I want a lighter, more relaxing workout (even though I haven't been pregnant for 3 years!). One drawback I'll point out is that the instructor tends to go off on tangents in the middle of poses, which can be annoying. You may find yourself saying, ""ok, can we get back to the poses now, please?"" a few times during this video. For that reason, I deducted one star, but despite that I think it's worth buying.",1179273600,,978,4.5625

The back stretches on all fours taught in the beginning are a great way to relieve lower back pain. I can do them even when not watching the tape, and my lower back pain goes away. Its a great way to avoid taking Tylenol all day! I love this tape and would recommend it for all pregnant yoga beginners.",1178150400,,513,4.244897959183674

I am not flexible at all, so this tape should last me a while; but for those who are more advanced, it may be a little to easy.  What I liked about it was that the instructor had a nice voice and that there were all pregnant women in the video.  And for 45 minutes, the video went fast.  I wasn't bored at all, and my body does feel better for doing it.  I think this will be routine for me; it helps with energy also and for tired, confined muscles.  For new yoga-ers, I highly recommend it, but for someone doing yoga previously, you may want to find something a bit more challenging.",1160092800,4,762,4.04

This really does seem to be a good prenatal yoga vidio but it is of no use to me and because I opened it to view I do not even think I can send it back which means I can not afford a different one.

Anyway the reason I can not use it is mostly the section called Downword Facing Dog. I have had problems in my previous yoga practice with that pose, even before I was pregnant and I am not going to risk hurting myself while PG. Even with the alternatives being shown this is not a workable yoga workout for me. Now I know I could just skip this section, but it is a large portion of the DVD. Anyway I wish there was a list of poses or some kind of discription that could be read before buying so we a consumers check if these yoga vidios will work for us.

1372378,5,B00004Y6AE,"I bought this DVD along with the Shiva Rea pregnancy yoga DVD when I was in my first trimester.  I was relatively fit when I got pregnant but didn't have any specific workout routine.  I found this DVD to be excellent for keeping my back & hips flexible.  I could really tell how well it worked when I got lazy & didn't do the yoga for a couple of days -- it felt SO good to get back into it & stretch out those aching hips!

Thanks to this DVD, I was much more flexible at 9 months pregnant than I was before I conceived.  I had no major back pain or sciatic pain to complain about, and I feel that the regular yoga practice was the key to my healthy pregnancy.

I agree with other reviewers that this DVD was much better than the Shiva Rea.  Shiva was annoying & my body didn't feel stretched and relaxed after that DVD.  I much preferred Yoga Mama -- it was reassuring to see the pregnant instructor and all the different pregnant body types in the class.  I also liked that I could do this routine without modifications throughout my entire pregnancy.  Occasionally, this instructor got a little annoying too, but at least I felt like I was getting a good stretch.

Right after my baby was born, I lent this DVD to a pregnnt neighbor, who has since moved.  I kind of wish I'd kept it.  There are days that I wouldn't mind doing this yoga DVD now, even though I'm not pregnant, and I will definitely buy it again when we go for kid #2.",1147824000,6,1438,4.1854545454545455

I bought Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga video and got easily annoyed by it.  It was much too easy for me and the instructor wasn't even pregnant.  My husband bought Yoga Mama for me for Christmas.  I absolutely loved it!  I am now 39 weeks and still very comfortable which is a shock since I am bigger this time.  I am still able to do everything like shaving my legs, self-pedicures, and playing on the floor with my son.

The pace of the workout is so easy and the instructor proceeds so gingerly it's as if she's teaching physical therapy or rehab patients. Also way too much sappy commentary. A normal, healthy pregnant woman could handle a bit more challenging pace. Contrary to what another reviewer said, inversions and most yoga poses are NOT contraindicated in low risk pregnancies. I have verified this with my obstetricians. On the contrary, many doctors are now encouraging more robust physical activities.

I also agree with another reviewer who said that there is too much talk between poses. It seems to take 10 minutes to even change positions. No flow whatsoever.",1137542400,11,841,4.915492957746479

The dialog is calm yet not cheesy and the background music is just that, it doesn't interfere with the process.

Would have liked a little more info about what not to do in yoga while pregnant, so I could modify some of the poses in some of my other tapes which I actually like.

This doesn't give much direction beyond finding the pose and the instructor making some corny remarks. The breathing pace seemed off as well, especially if you get winded easily as I do since I've become pregnant.",1127347200,,658,4.429752066115703

I just wish the hamstring stretches were held a bit longer.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I could have used just a little more instruction if I wasn't able to do all the moves (which was the case) but since I'm an admitted novice, then I have to say this video has been a noticeable help already with my backache which was the primary reason I bought it.  Already the pain has subsided so I'm thrilled.",1109462400,4,572,4.229357798165138

This tape fails in many respects. Poses are rushed through before you have a chance to enjoy the full benefits. The instructor is annoying and talks non-stop. There is no discussion of how to modify poses or positon feet to compensate for your changing center of balance (my class instructor does this). The mediation section at the end is way too short. While the length of the tape is good, if you've got any experience doing yoga, you'll find this too easy and way too rushed. It's like they tried to cram a 75 minute workout into 40 minutes.",1101945600,6,709,4.220588235294118

The first time was a bit confusing (have you ever tried to look at a TV screen while in ""downward facing dog""?!).  Anyway, while not a strenous ""workout"" it is a wonderful and relaxing stretch video.  I have used it many nights just to unwind and stretch my legs after work.  It has also helped a bit with the calf cramps that are so prevelant in pregnancy.  I am now in my third trimester, and still love doing this tape at night to help all my muscles stretch and relax.

I have been doing yoga for about 8 years and there are very few pregnancy videos on the market. I have a few crunch tapes which I enjoy and so I thought I would give this a shot.

This is a very EASY tape. If youve never done yoga you'll catch on and enjoy it. However I feel that it was much too easy and too light for someone who has been doing it for a while.

I did this tape 5 days a week throughout my pregnancy and I never really got a good stretch from it. Maybe thats how pregnancy is but I hope to find something better next time around.",1092614400,31,728,3.80794701986755

The same time, I don't feel like I get much of a work out, or stretching done. Instructor spends too much time talking while you're just standing there waiting for a pose demostration. I much more prefer ""Prenatal Yoga"" with Shiva Rea as an instructor. But Crunch Mama is good occasionally, when I'm feeling lazy.",1091404800,2,418,4.5131578947368425
1372434,4,B00004Y6AE,"I have some experience with yoga and I found this video to be very basic. The poses are very easy and the instructor takes a lot of time to explain each move. Yoga Mama would be a good choice for someone who's never done yoga before.
Since most of the moves are merely for stretching rather than toning, this video isn't very challenging. You won't break a sweat. However, I think that it's a great video for a pregnant woman to do before bedtime because it really stretches out your whole body.
For a well rounded exercise routine during pregancy I would add a video with a cardio workout like FitMama, or perhaps walking or cycling. This video won't give you all the exercise you need, but as I said the stretches are excellent and I'm sure I'll be doing it a lot towards the end of my pregnancy when I start feeling aches in my back and legs.
The instructor is okay--she seems a bit dippy when she giggles but all in all she's not too annoying.",1085616000,,947,4.325842696629214

1372437,5,B00004Y6AE,"Yoga Mama is such a wonderful video. It's the winning combination of a warm and intelligent teacher and a gentle flowing yoga routine that makes it so. I initally spotted the video at CRUNCH GYM in Los Angeles and purchased it for one of my mom-to-be friends. She used it and loved it!
As an aside from the pregnancy, the video is a nice gentle yoga class for anyone - with child or not. You can tell that Sue Elkind is a master yogi with great expertise.",1074124800,,455,4.241379310344827
1372438,4,B00004Y6AE,"Although I wouldn't call this the perfect prenatal yoga practice, it has some distinct strengths over other prenatal yoga videos I've seen.  Visibly pregnant Sue Elkind leads a class of about a dozen women of in all stages of pregnancy through a well-chosen series of  yoga poses.  One woman demonstrates modifications for the less flexible, but most of the women do the program without modification, even in late pregnancy.  The instructor talks through each pose, giving special attention to the balance and posture changes of pregnancy and emphasizing the connections between body and mind and mother and baby-to-be.  This constant commentary makes the poses easy to follow even when not watching the screen, but may distract from the meditative quality of yoga practice.
Yoga Mama is most appropriate for women with no or limited yoga experience and no exercise constraints.  It may also be helpful for intermediate level women in late stages of pregnancy, for tired days, or as the easy part of a rotation of practices.  Advanced yoga students, however might find this video frustratingly basic and prefer to develop a personalized yoga practice using books (try Preparing for Birth With Yoga by Janet Balaskas).  Women who need greater modification might want to try the Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga program instead.  Props: sticky mat (or carpet), folded blanket, folded towel (for wrist pain), chair (for modifications)
Personal Experience: I used prenatal yoga videos several times a week in addition to prenatal classes in a yoga studio once or twice a week.  Although no video can equal a live class, this one captures some of the spirit of practicing yoga in a room full of pregnant women  of all shapes and sizes.  For home practice, I could choose between Yoga Mama and Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga video.  Although Shiva Rea's video is longer and has better production values, I plunked this video in the VCR more than twice as often.  I preferred the selection of poses in Yoga Mama (though I wish each pose lasted longer) and I preferred following Yoga Mama's visibly pregnant instructor (skinny Shiva Rea demonstrates first trimester poses with no hint of a belly).  In addition, I found it much more motivating to see the whole class perform without modifications in contrast to the extreme modifications in Shiva Rea's program (the third trimester woman does most of the poses seated on a chair).  To my surprise, I was able to comfortably and safely perform Yoga Mama without modification up until a few days before delivery.  Practicing prenatal yoga helped minimize back pain, leg cramps, and other pregnancy discomforts.",1069113600,80,2636,5.064814814814815

If I put this video on for 15 minutes, I don't get much of a workout because the instructor spends so much time talking. She is a very over talker! I don't seem to get anything accomplished with this video. Leisa Hart's FITMAMA is so much better and worth it, I don't think people who truly like video are yoggies or fitness people, they are very curious to me if they like this video, it is a poor production by Andrea Ambandos with Dragonfly, she is producing more junk these days.",1068681600,2,597,4.2
1372440,5,B00004Y6AE,"I am one week from my baby girl's due date, and have been using this tape throughout my pregnancy.  It has been a life saver for me, especially for lower back and hip pain.  I like the instructor's encouraging, light-hearted tone, and seeing all the women in various stages of pregnancy.  I've enjoyed yoga for about seven years, and I think this tape is appropriate for beginners through at least intermediate yoga students.  They show lots of adaptations for different levels of flexibility and comfort, which helps when I'm feeling sore or just lazy.  I will probably keep doing this tape even after our baby arrives.
I also have the Shiva Rea tape, which is pretty good.  However, I find myself using Yoga Mama much more often, because it's shorter and generally more inspiring.  Doing this tape at least twice a week has really helped me stay active and flexible during pregnancy, and I hope it helps during labor!  I've even got this tape packed in my bag in case I'm stuck at the hospital for a long time in early labor.",1065225600,,1027,4.604395604395604
1372441,4,B00004Y6AE,"I am 20 weeks pregnant and have been doing yoga for about 3 years, although I haven't been doing it since about week 9 of my pregnancy. I wanted to find a good video that would help me get back into my practice, stretch me out, and strengthen my muscles.
I bought Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga video and was annoyed by it. Although I am very familiar with common yoga postures, I couldn't understand what I was supposed to be doing from listening to her, and I had to keep looking at the screen to figure out what she was talking about. Then, as soon as I got into the pose, she would quickly shift to something else, so I never got to hold any pose for more than a few seconds. Annoying. She also drones on at the beginning of the video for a few minutes, which is minimally boring when you want to get started the first time, but REALLY boring when you are doing the tape on a regular basis and you have to fast forward through it every time. Lastly, I felt like I got no workout whatsoever from Shiva Rea's tape, and barely a stretch. Maybe if I had been able to hold the poses a little longer than the split second she allowed... The woman in her third trimester hardly did anything at all.
Crunch Mama was MUCH better. I really liked the teacher. She was straightforward, and best of all, she was actually pregnant! She gave a better selection of poses, a bit more challenging, but still very easy, and I hardly had to even look at what she was doing...she was very descriptive when telling us what moves to do next. I liked the variety of pregnant women in her ""class"". She had women in all different stages, and they were all doing pretty much the same moves, except for one woman who was demonstrating modified moves for women who wanted to take it really slow. My only complaint was that I would have liked to hold the poses a bit longer, especially at the end, when she guided us into a closing relaxation/meditation poses that you normally allow at least 10 minutes for in a typical yoga class...in the video we got about a minute to relax and clear our minds before being told to get back up again.",1063670400,187,2106,4.293969849246231

It's a little easy for those who have been doing yoga for a while.  Although, it is perfect for me because I spent my whole first trimester feeling way too ill to do anything.  It's helping me get back into form.  I would recommend this video for anyone who is looking for a relaxing stretch to release tension and gain flexibility.",1062979200,5,460,4.6419753086419755

Before my second pregnancy I was an almost daily exerciser, and thought myself up to the most challenging level of exercise.  After a first trimester where getting up my heart rate would leave me curled up on the couch willing the nausea to pass, I was relieved to finally find something relaxing but that still left me feeling re-connected to all of my major muscle groups.  You won't be left panting and sweating - but that's not really what you need as the weight in your midsection keeps increasing and sapping you of extra energy.  This video is calming and strengthening all at once, and is a pleasure to do.",1060128000,,759,4.438848920863309
1372456,4,B00004Y6AE,"This video is fairly simple and really not too taxing. It's been great for stretching and relaxing, though I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something that actually feels like a workout. I always feel relaxed and stretched at the end of it, but don't feel as though I necessarily got much of a workout. However, it's great if you're just having a very low energy day but still want to do something. It would probably also be perfect for someone who never really exercised much before they became pregnant and wanted something to start with.
I honestly prefer my FitMama prenatal workout DVD to this video, but that's simply because I feel like I get more out of it than this. However, I still feel that this is a good video as long as you're not expecting much of a workout from it. It has a nice variety of poses and the instructor is fine. My only annoyance with her is the way she appears to be trying not to laugh when she's explaining kegels, but I think that's just because I'd prefer if she'd just explain it as opposed to trying to save our sensibilities. Other than that one instance, I don't find her to be annoying at all, which is a big plus when it comes to any instructional video or DVD.
So as long as you keep in mind that this isn't exactly a serious workout, I would recommend this. But if you're looking for something that feels like more of a workout, there are other prenatal workout DVDs and videos out there that would probably suit better than this one.",1059609600,2,1489,4.398550724637682

It is not very difficult, but it does make me feel relaxed and does relieve my back aches.  Now that I am in my  third trimester I find that I really like the length and ease of the video. You are still moving around, even when your body is finding it more diffficult.  As for the commentary, I did not find it annoying.  I actually enjoy her comments about the baby.

Additionally, I'm recovering from abdominal surgery as well, and this video allows me to get in some much needed exercise and stretches while my belly heals.

Some reviews said you spend a lot of time in downward dog, but I've done other yoga workouts that have you in this pose much longer and more often. I wouldn't worry too much about it. There is a good mix of gentle poses.
I like the fact that there are lots of modifications for people that aren't that flexible and that the focus is on making room for baby to be comfortable and to get ready for labor.
The only kind of bad thing was the transition between poses, but like any at home work out DVD you can learn the routine pretty quick which makes the transitions easier each time you play it.",1493337600,,917,4.128491620111732
7926785,5,B00004Y6AE,"Easy, relaxed prenatal yoga DVD. Great if you are a beginner or need something easy that day. I like mixing it with Hilaria Baldwin's DVD and Desi's DVD.",1485129600,,153,4.5
7926786,2,B00004Y6AE,I thought this would be a nice way to stretch and use as a recovery from the other workouts I've been doing but it ends up feeling like a waste of 40 minutes.  It does have some good stretching in it but the pace is so slow and the instructions are so confusing that it ends up being frustrating instead of relaxing.,1484524800,,316,4.096774193548387
7926787,5,B00004Y6AE,This really helps me stretch out.  I'm 20 weeks and this program really REALLY helps me get kinks and stiffness out!! I love it.  I feel so much better when I'm done doing it.  This is the first yoga DVD I've done that I've actually enjoyed and look forward to doing.,1476230400,,267,4.196078431372549
7926788,5,B00004Y6AE,A good beginner paced yoga. I tried another that was too fast for my to keep up between the changing poses. This was more beginner friendly. I tried it because of my back pain during pregnancy and it really seemed to help!,1467676800,,222,4.309523809523809

7926790,5,B00004Y6AE,i used this video all through my pregnancy with twins.  The yoga stretches made it so I could sleep.  If I skipped yoga too many times my hips and legs ached so much that I couldn't sleep,1440028800,,187,4.027027027027027
7926791,5,B00004Y6AE,I had 3 dvds for prenatal yoga and used this one very often. Was upbeat and not to hard to perform. Hadnt ever done yoga before. Will keep for next pregnancy.,1439510400,,158,4.129032258064516
7926792,2,B00004Y6AE,"I'm not a yogi so I didn't like this much, I thought I would try it since I was pregnant but I still couldn't get with it. Much luck to anyone who is trying yoga for the first time with a DVD like this!",1438041600,,202,3.6136363636363638
