8502148,5,B006OS1AP6,"This series was a pleasant surprise for me (unlike the previous reviewer, I had not seen the original series on TV). Each of the 18 episodes discusses a different battle tactic, such as blitzkrieg, flank attack, etc. Included are two examples, from two different conflicts, of each tactic. The narrator lists the key processes to each tactic, such as ""objective,"" ""intelligence,"" etc. and details how the commander met or didn't meet the requirements for the tactic. Most of the examples cited are from World War Two, but also included are tactics from the Korean War, Vietnam War, the French-Indochina War, the two Gulf Wars and World War One. I've seen many documentaries of World War Two, so it was enlightening to hear about the tactics used in some of the other wars.

I was not able to detect any errors of fact in the entire series, and I was carefully listening.

The price for this series might seem high, but remember, you're getting 18 full-length episodes. I found it well worth the money. I'll watch it again.",1346112000,2,1022,4.768361581920904
8502149,5,B006OS1AP6,"This DVD is a reissue of the Battleplan TV series released in 2007 wich had 5 discs. This newer version has 6 discs covering all the original material, plus a few more episodes/topics. I own the original show and love its combination of computer graphics and video covering topics like ""Urban Warfare"", ""Deception"", and ""Raider Operations"". This is a really good military documentary for not a lot of money and I recommend it. But, if you have the original series you aren't missing much with the addition of the 6th disc. Had I known that before I bought this documentay--I probably wouldn't have purchased it but their were no reviews and since this 'new' version is from a new distributor--they didn't bother telling the consumer that the product was already released! So I am doing my fellow military/documentary lovers on Amazon a 'solid' as 'Link"" said on The Mod Squad. I gave my original series to a friend and have kept this 'upgraded' one for myself so everybody's happy but you might decide to skip this show if you already own it. Your Welcome!",1339027200,8,1056,4.744565217391305
