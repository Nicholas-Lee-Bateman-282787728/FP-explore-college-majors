8597109,1,B00DSAUL08,"One of the unfortunate aspects of an otherwise 'good thing' is that the recent access to 'affordable film-making' via DIGITAL recording has made it possible for people who don't have a lot of film savvy to produce their filmic fantasies and dump them on the public.  Despite a relatively cheap per movie price - this compilation of 7 features by 7 different 'directors' provides 'over 8 hours' of some of the most insipid & amateurish drivel ever to be burned onto a DVD disk.

Perhaps one of the elements that led to my discontent with this particular 'package' was the prominent use of the term 'grindhouse' to describe the content - which could lead one to expect that this was a collection of obscure period pieces from the good old days of the true grindhouse phenomenon - BUT - all of these flix are actually post millennium 'modern' attempts to 're-create' the 'so bad it's good' aspect that makes the 'real' grindhouse product (some times) retrospectively 'amusing'.  All of the movies contained in ""Psychopaths & Maniacs"" are just plain 'bad' and BORING!  Despite the somewhat titillating titles and 'write-ups' per the individual films - the inept acting, editing, and scripting make them all incredibly tedious to try to sit thru - hoping that something interesting or uniquely transgressive might occur - but nothing ever does.  Gore is minimal, very little 'skin' on display, production values are nil.  When people talk about feeling as if they are 'wasting their lives' watching certain things - they could well be alluding to this group of films.  I ultimately found myself thinking "" what an F***ing waste of time!"" and shut the thing off.  Really can't recommend this one!",1468540800,,1690,4.905263157894737
8597110,5,B00DSAUL08,"With 7 titles for only 9.99 you really cant go wrong, This is a great deal & perfect for your Halloween needs, great for a gore filled movie night. First off we got The photographer which plays out like a great little Giallo indie film, Next up Naked Trip which is a Noir film, We also have a great little gore-fest anthology featuring Alice Coopers daughter Calico Cooper in Scarlet Fry's Junkfood Horrorfest. Also included on this little masterpiece is The Bisbee cannibal club which reminds me of those 80's S.O.V classics we all love so much because they are so bad they are good, another great title on this compilation is Fetish Dolls die laughing this is right out of the school of H.G Lewis meets John waters, and then Zombie Lovers which will fill any Zombie's appetite lots of blood & guts. So for 9.99 I highly recommend picking this up, like I said you can't go wrong.",1379289600,,880,4.50625
