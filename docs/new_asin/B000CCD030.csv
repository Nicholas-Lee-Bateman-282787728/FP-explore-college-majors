2456364,4,B000CCD030,"After purchasing UFO: TOP SECRET because of my awarness of Robert Lazar from years past, I still viewed it with healthy skeptism. And, while I remain a skeptic as to alien technologies at Area 51's Groom Lake facility, I find Robert Lazar remarks crediable even though there is a serious lack of objective evidence beyond his statements. I have no reason to disbelieve him yet the alleged facts he puts forth are exterme and far fetched. I want to believe the technology he describes exists beyond just his mind. IF there is such alien technologies that are (or were) at Area 51, perhaps NOW IS THE TIME to share it with NASA since the federal agency is on the verge of an implosion from a lack of funding to return American men and women to the surface of the moon or to even exit Low Earth Orbit (or even to make orbit after 2010).

The cool thing about the DVD, if nothing else, is that it gets the mind thinking about theorical physics of spaceflight beyond chemical propulsion systems. As the famed author Napoleon Hill once said: ""Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."" Therefore, I adjudge Robert Lazar as worthy to view in ""UFO: TOP SECRET"" and provide it four stars. It will get you thinking if nothing else.",1250899200,7,1239,4.556053811659193
2456365,5,B000CCD030,"UFO: To Secret - The Bob Lazar Interview (2005)
A JCG Production
Editor: Karl Quintanilla
Running Time : Approximately 53 minutes

This program is what I consider to be a companion to another DVD I have previously reviewed called:

UFOs and Area 51, Vol. 2: The Bob Lazar Video (1991)
Written, Produced and Directed by Gene Huff and Bob Lazar
Presented by Bob Lazar
Duration: Approximately 40 minutes (main program)

Whilst the latter was produced in 1991 this program is essentially another more recent interview with Bob Lazar conducted in 2003. The two programs are sufficiently different in content as to make them both worthwhile individually but also (preferably) together. Without having seen the first program I think a viewer would possibly not fully appreciate what is being discussed in the second as it elaborates on ideas presented before. The 2003 production does have a better picture quality than the earlier one and includes some good photographs and video of what are commonly called UFO's, or possible extra-terrestrial craft.

If you are interested in UFO's then this is a worthwhile purchase, not only for the fascinating story of Bob Lazar's own personal experience, but also to hear what seem to be very plausible explanations of how these craft operate and travel the vast distances of space.

The program's narrator begins with the comments that:

""Ever since man has looked up into the stars, he has seen strange objects in the skies, but the search for proof of extra-terrestrial intelligence has produced dissapointing results. The best so-called evidence has only been a few photographs and film clips, but now all that's about to change... a former government scientist has come forward to discuss the military's classified work on extra-terrestrial spacecraft.""

""The military recruits many talented civilians when special expertise is required and propulsion expert Bob Lazar claims he was one of them. In this exclusive interview he gives his detailed account of his employment with the Department of Naval Intelligence at the top secret facility known as S4, where according to Bob, he was hired to work on recovered alien spacecraft.""

""S4 is located 125 miles north of Las Vegas, and 15 miles south of Groom Lake... this not now so secret military base at Groom Lake, Nevada is known as Area 51 or Dreamland as insiders like to call it.""

""Born in 1959 in Coral Gables, Florida, Bob has lived much of his life in Las Vegas, Nevada. With degrees in physics and electronics from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and Caltech [California Institute of Technology] he has dabbled in everything from chemistry to fireworks in an effort to understand the finer points of propulsion.""

""By 1989 Bob was brought into the top secret program at S4, known as Project Galileo. In the following interview, Bob reveals many details of his amazing experience.""

The dialog between Bob Lazar and the unknown interviewer begins. Bob is comfortably seated in an armchair and begins answering the questions put to him. Here are a few excerpts which I thought might be of some interest to you the reader:

Q: Is this research confined to the U.S. Government or did you see any international involvement?
A: At one point in time the Russians were involved... and supposedly there was some breakthrough made by our team however this project was split up and right after that happened the Russians were no longer permitted on the facility at all.

Q: You mentioned these beings have historically interacted with man. How? What was involved there?
A: Allegedly this interaction has occured since man was a simian creature. There were genetic alterations made.

Q: How specifically did the briefings detail how the aliens manipulated our genetics over the centuries.
A: It mentioned 65 or 63 corrections or additions to the genetic make-up that finally resulted in a human creature.

Q: What was the incident in 1979 that brought the alien exchange program of information to a halt?
A: Again, this is a story that was related to me, and ahh allegedly what happened in '79... there was some sort of information exchange going on where there were actual live aliens at the facility, and at one particular point there was an area where some security personel went to enter, and apparently because not the side-arms but the bullets in the side-arms from what I understand, if they would've entered the area the bullets would have detonated... ahhh and supposedly one of the creatures tried to stop the security personel from entering the area, and a fight ensued and the bottom line from the altercation was that the security personel, I don't remember how many were involved, but were all killed and they died of head wounds, and that's all that I heard of that story.""

Q: What was the size of the staff working on Project Galileo?
A: Well there were 22 people employed there totally.

Q: And that was specifically for the Galileo Project?
A: No, for the entire project. There were 22 people with majestic clearance. I had majestic clearance. Majestic clearance was designated 38 levels above Q clearance and Q clearance is the civilian top secret clearance.

Q: When did you see your first disc?
A: The first disc I saw I believe it was the second or I think it was the third time I was up there. Normally the bus pulled around to the opposite end of the facility which was the main entrance, and that's where we went in. On this particular occassion it pulled up to one of the hangar doors, which were normally closed, and the last one was open. We came out and I saw the disc in the hangar. Upon seeing it it struck me that 'Well this explains all the UFO sightings' not thinking that it was an extra-terrestrial craft - that this must have been some advanced form of fighter that we'd been working on for years - and you know people have just caught it being tested and so on and so forth, and it never occurred to me, even though I was looking at an extra-terrestrial vehicle that, you know, this wasn't man made.""

Q: How does the craft achieve lift?
A: It produces a gravity wave which is similarto the gravity wave that the Earth produces. However the craft phase-shifts the wave - in other words it turns the wave, not really in opposite polarity, but something to that effect - where it will work against the natural gravity wave of the Earth, and it produces lift in that effect.""

Q: Is there any internal protection for the crew? Does the craft generate a gravitational field inside the craft itself?
A: Well the craft generates its own gravitational field. Being inside that field essentially... doesn't shield you but essentially you're in - and this is a terrible way to say it - almost in a different realm, because you're now influenced only by that gravitational field... for instance people wonder how a craft like this can make a turn at
such high speed - a 90 degree turn - when they would imagine people slamming up against the wall or something to that effect, well that really wouldn't happen - inertia would have no effect. You're in a distortion - and don't forget that gravity distorts time and space - so really nothing is gonna influence you while you're in there.""

Q: Describe the gravity amplifiers for us and some of their different operating configerations.
A: There are 3 amplifiers. The craft can operate on a single one... can lift off the ground. The way in which it gets propelled are two different ways - there's what they call Omicron configeration where the craft is using one generator - or a Delta configeration where its utilising all three. Delta configeration would be for space travel;
essentially the craft would tilt up on it's side - as opposed to a science fiction movie where you see a flying saucer moving around - the craft will tilt up on it's side... focus the three gravity generators to a single point and move through space that way. Moving around a source of gravity is a problem to a disc - because it's interference essentially - so what they do is they work with that interference to their benefit. They'll use one gravity generator to lift the craft off the ground and as opposed to what we're used to - for instance a plane once it is in the air we envision thrust or some force coming out the back of it to push it forward - the crafts work
completely opposite of that... what they do is once they're hovering in the air they'll swing the gravity... two remaining gravity generators up in front of them and create a distortion... essentially a downhill... and the craft rolls down-hill for infinity... it's always chasing a little distortion. That's why they look goofy when they fly
around at low speed because they're essentially... and any time you run over... the gravity field around the Earth is not completely constant - it's unstable depending on the minerals and density in the Earth underneath it... gravity will vary somewhat and you will get odd movement to the craft so it's low speed mode is kind-of unstable for the most part.""

Q: With the gravity generators running, is there thermal radiation danger to the crew?
A: There is no thermal radiation while the reactor's running. The thermeonic generator is 100% efficient which is in violation of the First Law of Thermodynamics but in fact... it works.

Q: You were able to get away with a sample of Element 115. How much did you get away with?
A: No comment.

Q: Why do they appear as glowing balls of light in the night sky?
A: Well it's kind of the same reason why a neon light or flourescent light lights up. What you're dealing with is a high energy source in essentially a gas atmosphere - oxygen, nitrogen - and when you apply enough energy to a gas molecule they emit photons - they emit light, and it's really a bi-product of how the craft operates. Emitting that much energy the gas surrounding the craft emits light - the same reason why lightning is visible... it's a huge electrical discharge... and the gas emits light in the form of a lightning bolt.

Near the end Bob has this to say about the secrecy of the program:

""It's the security that prevents them from getting anywhere. They never do work hand in hand... you can't have a military mind. Science itself must communicate. You have to have a free exchange of ideas - that's how things progress, and when you do clamp down on a security system like that where you work in isolated groups and
ideas cannot be exchanged, you don't get anywhere and that's the problem they have.""

The final image of the program is a recording of a speech President Ronald Reagan gave to the Students and Faculty at Fallston High School in Fallston, Maryland on December 4, 1985. It does make one wonder if perhaps he was aware of something that was going on behind the scenes:

""I couldn't help at one point in our discussion privately with General Secretary Gorbachev... when you stop to think that we're all God's children wherever we may live in the world... I couldn't help but say to him: Just think how easy his task and mine might be in these meetings that we have held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species from another planet outside in the universe... we'd forget all of the local differences that we have between our countries and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this Earth together.""

I recommend this DVD, and rate it 5 stars, especially at it's current price of [...], which is considerably less expensive than most DVD's in this category.",1250899200,19,11535,4.713505461767626

8097101,4,B000CCD030,"Lazar's claims are so fantastic it's hard to believe. But from what I know of physics his story would make
a good theory of gravity propulsion, so why not just take ownership of it if he made it up. An incredible idea
to patent, though the patent would likely run out before it became reality.

The idea is so profound to me I tend to believe his story simply because if he made it up he should be trying
to develop it in secret, as he claims the government is trying to do.

Anyway, as a skeptic who is intrigued by UFOs I'm happy to add it to my collection! Anyone who doesn't understand

Bob Lazar's answers are informative, he gave a small lesson on how space, time, and gravity play together and I found that is was worth the discount price I paid for it.
