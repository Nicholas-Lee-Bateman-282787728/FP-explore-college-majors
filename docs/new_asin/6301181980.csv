8437550,5,6301181980,"Bouncing Back is awesome!! A definite must-see for any Mavericks fan! This tape tells the story of the team's classic 1987-88 season, from their opening win against Utah on Derek Harper's 3-point buzzer beater, through a 53-29 regular season record during which Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson became All Stars and Roy Tarpley won the Sixth Man award, to their improbable playoff run in which the Mavs knocked off the Olajuwon-led Rockets and Midwest division-winning Nuggets, before finally falling to the eventual champion Lakers in game 7 of the Western Conference Finals.
Narrated by standout broadcaster Allen Stone, Bouncing Back is witty and entertaining, and at times poignant and exhilirating. The tape also showcases the players' lives off the court as well, containing footage of Rolando Blackman's home life, Mark Aguirre's wedding, and sketches about ""Old Man"" Brad Davis featuring segments about rookies Jim Farmer and Steve Alford, fan favorite and star golfer Bill Wennington, and the explanation-defying backup center Uwe Blab.
Bouncing Back contains all this and much much more, all set to an excellent, upbeat soundtrack. In the words of then-coach John Mac Leod, ""I'm thrilled, I'm excited, uhh, its going to be challenging, and my goal, generally for right now - obviously there'll be more specific goals - but that is to continue...the winning tradition...that has been established here...with the Dallas Mavericks!""
Who cares if the team stunk in the 90s...this is absolute, classic Dallas Mavericks basketball at its finest, and true Mavs fans will rejoice the day they watch this phenomenal video. The term ""masterpiece"" is used way too loosely these days, but rest assured, Bouncing Back is a Masterpiece with a capital ""M"", any way you look at it.",1047945600,5,1775,5.253521126760563
