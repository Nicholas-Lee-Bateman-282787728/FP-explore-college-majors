4657407,3,B005D7E80S,"I think it's great to have a full boxset of some...of the films. I love the franchise. Putting all of the deluxe releases in one pack is a great idea, and the hockey mask is a very cool addition. But seriously, calling it an ultimate collection while parts 9, 10 , VS Freddy, and the remake are left out is very saddening. Not too ultimate to me. I'd love to own every Friday movie (heck even the TV series) in one full set, so please release a box set that has all of the movies in it at once before apllying the ""ultimate"" tagline. Especially since there is an existing boxset of the first 8 already that came out nearly 7 years ago.

4657408,4,B005D7E80S,"I'm actually starting to feel bad for those goons over at Paramount. Even when their hearts ARE in the right place, there's still no pleasing a die-hard Friday the 13th fan. The 2004 box set was admittedly a slap in the face, especially for fans who didn't read up before buying it. Repackaging your shoddy late-90s DVDs behind mediocre artwork (what was with that awful font?), doubling up the movies in order to use less discs, and skimming on the extras was a bad move on Paramount's part.

But let's give Paramount credit where it's due. It may have taken them a few years, but their 2009 Deluxe Edition DVDs rectified many of the first box set's mistakes: Better picture & audio quality, more commentaries (except for 2 & 3 - where are you Steve Miner?), an ""Uncut"" version of the original and a 3D version of Part 3, and better cover art (at least in my opinion - I just hated the different font logo they decided to use for parts 5-8). I initially picked a couple of these up, but ultimately held off in case Paramount decided to double-dip and release them all together.

Unless you already own the Deluxe Editions separately, this is the best Friday collection you're likely to ever see, outside of (potentially) a future Blu-ray box set. And personally I don't understand the complaining about this being DVD; these movies were all shot in the '80s, for small or sometimes miniscule budgets. A Blu-ray release will not be noticeably better than what these remastered DVDs are offering - you won't get further great leaps in picture and sound quality with a series like this, nor will you likely get any more extras down the road (for all those holding out on the mythical 'uncut' versions of some of the sequels, Sazuko's review pretty much explains why that's not likely to ever happen).

EDIT: A note about the infamous packaging: Yes, the packaging sorta sucks. It looks nice, but stuffing discs into tight cardboard sleeves is never a good idea. HOWEVER, if you carefully and slowly slide the discs out while slightly loosening the sleeves around them, you shouldn't have any problems. I didn't have any instances with glue getting stuck to the discs either, so maybe I'm just lucky. Bottom line is, this is still a worthwhile purchase for the price, ESPECIALLY when compared to the 2004 box set. So what if it takes an extra 2 seconds to slide each disc out?",1316390400,2,2373,4.658711217183771
4657409,3,B005D7E80S,"this is purely a cash and grab re-re-re-release. if you are easily taken by ""cool"" artwork, then buy this! but i am sick and tired of paramount regurgitating our beloved horror franchise friday the 13th over and over again. it is long over due time for these 80's horror classics to get their long over-due directors cut treatments. paramount, enough of the shame and embarassment concerning these horror
films and the mpaa?! stand aside and let the masses have what we want...our friday the 13th film series released uncut and uncensored to dvd, blu ray, and vhs.

most of us horror film fans are not fooled!",1315699200,4,609,4.745283018867925
4657410,4,B005D7E80S,"I think fans need to understand that it's not a bad set.  There is money to be made and fans to please for releasing multiple versions of the same film on multiple platforms; even multiple versions on the same platform.

I am seriously considering getting this box set as I do not have the Deluxe Editions on DVD.  I have Part 1 on Blu Ray.  For the fans that already purchased the singles; I understand them passing on this box.  But a lot of fans may not have purchased any of the singles.

Also, it puts it out there again just in time for Halloween.  This is a whole new box set that will help bring in a whole new generation of fans.  The mask is not perfect but it's not bad either.  And these versions of the films are better than the old box set (and really are the versions the films should have been made into in the first place.  Even still, the old box set is what made Friday the 13Th accessible to me.  The first eight films at a good price in one box.  I didn't care two films were on one disc for the old box set either.

I can see this being a great value for new fans that want better versions of the films for a good deal.  That's only going to help the community.

However, I did not rate it five stars because I still want Blu Rays like many of the fans do.  If this was the same box set with Blu Rays, I'd be happy with it and give it five stars.  Maybe if this sells well it will help push the Blu Rays forward.

Also, for fans complaining about not getting uncut versions; learn your Friday the 13Th and film history and you'll understand that's not going to likely ever happen.

The real reason is that it would cost money.

[...]
""There was some discussion about adding the lost scenes (especially in Part 4) back into the picture, but there are a slew of legal issues surrounding a revised version. It mainly has to do with the guilds -- the Writers Guild and Directors Guild -- who have strict rules about making changes to director's and writer's work. That said, of course there could be a way to create a new or alternate version if the director and writer were to come to terms with the studio, but that is a long road and we honestly thought it would be best to show fans all of the trimmed gore sequences with multiple angles and director commentary than trying to reinsert pieces of these trims into the actual film.""

The film business works differently than many others and you can't just do a re-cut of a film because you have all of the parts. The reason for this is that re-cutting the film constitutes a new version of the film.

Thus, dropping deleted scenes in as special features cost nothing but reintegrating them into the full film would be a substantial cost.

The only reason the first film was done this way was that it was not a modern re-cutting of the film (such as doing any of the sequels would be.) All they did was take the European version that was released circa thirty years ago and released it over here as a 'unrated' version. Which, to be honest, Sean has stated that very little was ever cut or left out of the first Friday the 13Th because they were on a tight schedule and budget and just didn't have to time to film hardly anything more than what was absolutely necessary. What we see in the European Edition aka the Deluxe Edition, is considered to be the fully restored film by most people. And I see little reason to doubt that this is true.

Newline did a similar thing with Part 9. The 'unrated' version on the DVD was nothing more than the European version. As such, that is why we don't see the original ending or other deleted scenes; such as the fully grown Hell Baby reintegrated into the film. That would constitute a new cut of the film, and Newline would have had to spend more money.

Update 10/05/2011
I have the box set now.  I wanted to let everyone know that the mask is smaller than regular size.  As such, it is clearly designed for a decoration and not for wearing.  I love the special features and am enjoying the box very much.  I have been reading others' reviews of the box design and am also concerned with whether or not the discs will scratch.  Time will tell more.",1314921600,18,4160,4.269132653061225

4657413,4,B005D7E80S,According to ShockTillYouDrop.com and other various websites this set will contain all the Deluxe Editions of all eight Paramount releases of the Friday the 13ths that came out in 2009. So this is definitely a different set than the box set of the first eight Friday the 13th movies that were released in 2004. It will have all of the Tales From Camp Crystal Lake and extra commentaries that were released on the individual Deluxe Editions. Friday the 13th Part 3 will have 3-D glasses included with it. No new Blu-ray release of a box set as of yet. I think I'll just stick with the old box set. I have some of these Deluxe Editions already. The ones I want anyway.,1313020800,13,666,4.467213114754099
4657414,4,B005D7E80S,"I used to own the ""From Crystal Lake To Manhattan"" DVD set a few years ago but sold it in hopes that Paramount would eventually release all the ""Friday The 13th"" movies on Blu-ray. I bought 1-3 on Blu-Ray since those are the only ones that have been issued on BR thus far. I came across ""The Ultimate Collection"" at a FYE store for $30 and got it to tide me over until the rest of the films come out on BR. While I agree with other reviewers on the shoddy packaging details, I solved the problem by buying paper disc sleeves and inserting the DVDs in them. They're not too bulky and slide into the page slots pretty easily. My only major gripe with the entire collection is the lack of extras that were previously included on the ""From Crystal Lake To Manhattan"" edition; Parts 7 and 8 are missing their theatrical trailers, Part 3 is missing the cast audio commentary track (which I listened to and enjoyed), and there were several featurettes/interviews that weren't carried over into this set. I still enjoyed watching these movies again and they look and sound amazing. I'll keep this until ALL the movies are released on Blu-Ray, then I'll probably sell this. :-)",1342742400,2,1168,4.540284360189573

THE PROBLEM: THE PACKAGING. THE BOOKLET THAT HOLDS THE DISC & GIVES U ALL THE DETAILS IS NICE. THE ISSUE IS THE EXTREMELY SHODDY CARD-BOARD SLOTS, THAT VERY QUICKLY SCRATCHES THE DISC. IF PARAMOUNT GAVE A F*** ABOUT THEIR LOYAL JASON FANS, THEY WOULD HAVE PROVIDED INDIVIDUAL SLOTS WITH A SCRATCH-FREE RESISTANT BASE.

4657417,5,B005D7E80S,"I got the new box set as a birthday present it November. And after reading reviews here and on other sites, I must say I was a little biased to the fact that it was going to suck. But to my surprise and delight I loved it. 7 of the 8 discs were perfect with only Part 8 having minor scratches on the disc. Now I know that they are supposed to be pristine when you take it out of the package. So only 1 disc having scratches on it is a plus in my mind. And this is Paramount that released this set, so what do you expect? They always fall flat on their faces on DVD releases, they failed on the first Friday The 13th box set in 2004, and the individual discs released before that set came out were bare bones editions, with zero extras and no 5.1 surround sound. The extra disc in the original set was cool, but the set left a lot to be desired. This set has a lot more commentaries, and with the exception of Parts 2 and 3. Part 3 only has the 3-D and 2-D versions of the film. The other 7 discs are flat loaded with special features and commentaries. The packaging isn't the best but, like I said my discs were near perfect with the exception on Part 8. The little hockey mask is made of a hard plastic and really cool, and the 3-D glasses included are a little annoying but, all in all I would and have recommended this set and will do so again in the future.

Haven't picked it up yet as I normally get everything cheaper from amazon. But after watching...waiting. still seeing 77ish used. Add to the fact the discs scratching is a crap shoot, might be worth looking off line. And getting a receipt while you're at it.",1334966400,,395,4.577464788732394
4657419,3,B005D7E80S,"I should make it known that I bought my copy of this collection for $40 at Walmart, where there were several on the shelf. I think $50 is the max I would have payed for this.
The fact that this is over $100 on amazon is crazy, I would never have payed that.

I did not have all the problems that most people seem to complain of with the discs being scratched when they opened them. My discs were all in good shape, although I definitely agree that the sleeves leave much to be desired. It has a hassle trying to get some of the discs in and out of the extremely tight sleeves. The other issue I had was that the plastic box seems to have been held together with 100 yr old glue, and came apart on the first day I opened it. i was easily able to fix it with packing tape, but the point is they could have tried a bit harder. The mask was a nice addition to my memorabilia collection as well.",1331164800,,890,4.0

The movies themselves are great, Part 3 is in 3D, but it comes with glasses, so the newer technology will not work on them. All the movies are uncut and have so many special extras. The mask is really cool. It is on the smaller size, but it fits me fine. The 3D glasses have the hockey mask design on them. There is also an 8 page booklet, in which the disks are in and it tells you how many deaths, what weapons were used and some background on the film.",1329955200,,609,4.083333333333333
4657421,4,B005D7E80S,"This collection contains films part 1 to 8 in deluxe editions, the image and audio quality are good, each DVD bring some interesting extra features as a mini-series called ""Lost Tales from Camp Blood"" (just part 3 is missing as the third movie comes in two versions, regular and 3D, there is just a trailer as an extra), there is also a special called ""The Crystal Lake Massacres Revisited"" that is kind of a journalistic documentary commenting facts of the murders. Besides that there are deleted scenes and behind the scenes featurettes that show the tricks behind some death scenes of the movies. Part 3 has some cool effects when watched with the 3D glasses. Regarding the packaging, the book where the discs come in is very beautiful, the only issue is that as some other reviewers have stated the discs I received came with some scratches but all of them played perfectly, the replica of Jason's mask is pretty cool!

4657423,1,B005D7E80S,"Aside from the disastrous packaging many are complaining about (with just cause), where are the two final films in the complete series? By that i mean Friday the 13th: Jason goes to hell, as well as the final part Jason X?? This is not a complete package without those two last films in the Jason franchise... not to also mention the spinoff film Freddy vs Jason (which isn't necessary as its not a specific Jason film but it would help). Hence, this is 2 films short from being a real Friday the 13th collection. If you want to get very specific they could have also have waited to include the semi-recent Friday the 13th remake. But maybe im just being picky. Anyway, besides avoiding a purchase of scratched discs (thank God for blu-ray protective coating!) due to inept packaging (dear manufacterurs, stop placing dvds in cardboard sleeves! Yes im also looking at you Sex and the City Complete series set!), don't buy a film franchise with two very vital films that are legitamately part of that franchise completely missing for no good reason whatsoever.",1328572800,,1059,4.760869565217392

You see she got me this boxset because i wanted the hockey mask really bad. I'm using this boxset as a collector's item so i haven't sat down and watched any of the movies or tried to take them out. I have the individual special edition dvd's that came out a couple years ago when the remake arrived. Anyways, after reading some of your reviews i went over to my shelf to investigate. Most of the disc came out without trouble. The exception would be Part 5 and Part 6. I had minor trouble getting those disc out of their sleeves. But once i did there was no apparent damage and the disc played fine on my player. Okay now onto the set itself. I have to admit the hockey mask peaked my interest but once i got the set opened i fell in love. I love how the disc are in a case like a book. I think that is very cool. Each movie has it's own individual disc unlike the boxset that came out a couple years back. On each sleeve there is a bit of trivia like when the movie came out, how much it made at the box office, how many stalled cars in each film, the different weapons used and how many victims fell at the hands of the Voorhees clan. Now, if you're a die hard fan you already know most of this information. The special features on each disc is more or less what we got with the individual releases when the remake came out. Part 3 is still in 3-D and they give you two pairs of glasses to go along with that. Okay, the hockey mask that came with the set is nice. You can't wear it because it is too small but you can put it as a display on your shelf or hang it on the wall like i did. The mask is not of cheap quality and seems very well made. Overall this boxset is not so bad and i'm very happy with it. If you have a few extra bucks and want to get this i recommend picking it up.",1323216000,2,1908,3.9074550128534704

Jason's hockey mask is made really nice, not just some cheap plastic. The hockey mask is not suppose to fit you; it is just FOR SHOW. If you are planning to wear it for Halloween, think again. The box that it comes in is nicely made. The book that holds the dvds is really cool, it has a lot of information. Some information is the body count, weapons used, fun facts, and the summary of the movie.
This collection has some flaws. Lets start with the book; the dvds are held in sleeves and when you take the out, the are scratches. I thought that they could have made the book better and tested the product before it is put out for sale. If they did, the set would be more money, it would come out later than it did, and no scratches on dvds. All of my dvds work and I'm fine with what I have. If you have OCD don't buy it, lol.

On the negative side about this set, is how the discs are arranged. They have no protection whatsoever and are just throw there in cardboard style, they should have use at least sleeves envelopes to protect the discs. They were scratched but played fine. I risked anyway because i have the ""SkipDr DVD & CD Manual Disc Repair System"" sold here to fix discs, but i did not have to use it yet, but i know that in time and with the way the discs are arranged they will get more scratch so in that part, the Crystal Lake to Manhattan set have better arrangement.",1320796800,2,1078,4.133333333333334

I brought it back to best buy in hope to exchange, problem was when we opened another one of the same kind, the discs were scratched too!! so please, don't buy, its waste especially when you have to return, wait till they get smart and use better packaging!",1320105600,3,517,4.128712871287129
4657439,3,B005D7E80S,"Well here it goes. First the Pros, and then the cons. The movies were great. The Dvd quality is excellent. The 3D qualit for part three is suprisingly well done. The movies are fun to watch for any horror fans. Are they AFI monumental epics? No! They are just pure campfire, 3:00am fun. This set contains the best Friday the 13th films, The ones made by Paramont. When New Line took over it just went down hill; they never explained how Jason came back after being dissolved in part eight. THis set is worth buying to own all the movies. The cons. The packaging is held together by a cheap glue tha doesn't hold. After only one day the box came apart and it won't stay together. a friend of mine also purchased this product, and has experienced the same problem. What do you expect, it's made in Mexico. The collector's booklet also serves as the holder for the discs, and it scratches the disc, so when you purchase this product you will want to find a better disc case. The Jason mask is cool, but pointless. The 3D glasses are cheap cardboard, so you have to take good care of them. I give this product three stars. The movies are great if you collect Jason, but the faulty packaging is not worth it. However it is a nice way to conviently own all eight original Friday the 13th films. The first two were the best!",1319932800,,1317,4.357723577235772
4657440,5,B005D7E80S,"Paramount isn't known for their fantastic releases of anything, so after years of limbo of barebones versions of these films we got a boxed set a few years back, that I never picked up due to expensive cost and not much replay value in terms of what was offered.

A few years ago, like 2009, we got the ""deluxe editions"" of each film, and while they have a lot to be desired, when you grew up on Anchor Bay releases that actually were put together with care, similar to what Arrow does now, cause Anchor Bay seems to have run out of films or spunk, they were probably the best we were going to get. For whatever reason I never picked them up, but if you did this release doesn't even apply to you and you can just live in the comfort of those because there is nothing new here.

This set is simply a way to get all the Deluxe Editions together of the first 8 films (the Paramount ones) into one set, albeit with numerous problems...but with a price you can't refuse.

The packaging (the outer shell) over all is a bit flimsy and has a lot of room to contain the book that contains all 8 DVDs and the mini mask that doesn't even fit the youngest children in my family (around 8 old), though my friend says it fits him like a glove, he's 21 and kind of dumb. It also comes with two 3d glasses for Friday the 13th part III.

Now the book itself seems to be the real problem as the discs are slid into little slots and scratch the discs even the first time you take them out. SO PAY ATTENTION HERE. I immediately solved the problem (and any further scratching to my discs) to that by getting a bunch of white paper disc sleeves (it doesn't matter what color they are) and putting the discs in those and then in the sleeves in the book. It's simple, a little weird, but it works.

And that's it folks. This isn't a necessary set, if you don't want to go through all the hassle of those sleeves idea I mentioned you can pick up each deluxe editions separately for like 5 bucks each a big lots, Fye, or what have you...they run for a bit more on Amazon and Best Buy...and that will run you about ($40) the same as buying this set, which I picked up for a mere 35 bucks, and just a few years back all those Deluxe editions were at least 15 bucks a pop.",1319673600,,2244,4.137614678899083

4657446,4,B005D7E80S,"This is a great set for die-hard Jason fans. It has the deluxe versions of parts 1 - 8. I have to agree that the packaging is not the best but in this day and age, everybody is looking to cut costs. I recently bought a more pricey c.d. boxed set that was packed in a similar way so it's not just Paramount that has done this. The replica Jason mask is a great addition. It's not meant to wear but for display since it's a scaled down version. It may not be bluray but is still worth the price compared to buying each one individually. I own both bluray discs and dvd and still continue to buy both formats. If they did release a bluray set, it would probably be a bit more then I would want to spend. The book was O.K. but I wish it was more of a book with more info about the movies, making of the movies, Jason, etc. rather then being a dvd holder. Each dvd slides into a cardboard ""page"" of the book. The book does include limited information like what is seen on the back of regular dvd cases. Overall, I think this is a great boxed set but, like other movies and c.d.s I've bought, I don't like the packaging either. You are better off buying jewel cases to store the dvd's.",1318723200,,1179,4.086206896551724
4657447,3,B005D7E80S,"The deluxe editions of each movie are awesome with some very cool additional special features. The price is phenomenal; less than five dollars a dvd. I'll just reiterate what everyone else has said about the packaging. It is awful, just awful. I consider myself lucky because after scratching up the first disc (still plays though), I was able to get most of the discs out in decent condition. I had some empty dvd boxes laying around, so I placed them in those. So my main recommendation is to purchase dvd cases if you plan to watch the movies more than once. The mask was very cool except for the size. It's like a kids mask or something. Should have been advertised as a ""scaled"" replica. I still would have bought it, but without the disappointment.",1318291200,2,754,4.592592592592593

Besides you want them in the case snug right? If you did however purchase the deluxe editions a while back i would pass on this..the replica mask is really only for display, very small..you cant put it on and terrorize the neighbors. So if you are thinking about purchasing because of the mask i would invest your money in a full-sized mask: ([...]l)...if you missed out on the first set or deluxe editions then this set is a MUST!!

4657451,2,B005D7E80S,"First, if you own the previous box set from 2004 - keep it and skip this one. Yes, the special features of the 2004 box set are less than what you get here, but ask yourself this - how many times am I going to have to return this new set to get playable discs?

The replica Hockey Mask may be a cool thing to have, but the packaging of this new set is just terrible!

The discs are inserted into very snug cardboard sleeves that have been glued together. Most discs had this glue stuck to them and were scratched beyond playability. I even watched the YouTube video of how to take them out before I actually attempted to do so; but the result was the same, the discs were scratched as I mentioned above - beyond playability. Which means they were probably scratched when they were inserted.

As a diehard fan of the series - all I can say is, Shame On You Paramount. This isn't what the Hockey Mask ordered.

Three Stars for the Friday the 13th Series
Minus Two Stars for this stupid blunder of a packaging job.

UPDATE 10/09/11

I returned my set for exchange and didn't leave the store until I opened the new package and compared the discs. My new set had the same damage to the discs. Nothing changed - I showed the manager and he refunded my money.

Don't buy this set folks, major quality disappointment. Which sucks, because I wanted this set really bad. If you are one of the fortunate buyers whose discs are unscratched - Please Put Them In A Seperate Storage Case. Don't take the risk of scratches with these idiotic cardboard sleeves.

As a result of the hassle with this box set, I have changed my rating to 2 stars. This is no reflection on Friday the 13th as a series. I'm a huge fan, but Paramount should never have  approved this set for release.",1318032000,4,1761,4.328267477203648

4657453,4,B005D7E80S,"Well, I have to agree with most of the reviews. The packaging could have been more carefully thought out. I'm sure paramounts heart was in the right place, but like most companies, the cut on cost for materials must have been another priority. The disc holders  in the book are made of cardboard which can scratch dvd's pretty bad if not carefully removed. Upon opening the set I recieved,  a few of the discs were slightly scratched but not badly enough where the discs skip. I would return the set but with my luck the replacement set would probably be worse.  So instead of bitching and complaining I went out and bought cd rom sleeves. They're made of a paper/cotton blend (kind of like bond paper). I Put each disc into a sleeve, and then put each sleeve into the original cardboard slot in the book. They not only fit perfectly, but the dvds are in a softer material reducing the risk of scratching them more. The book will flare out a bit but not too much where it will damage it. I hope next time a box set like this comes out,  they spend the extra money on better materials. I'm sure fans like my self wouldn't mind spending the extra 10 bucks on a set made better. But then again, sometimes you just have to go through the D.I.Y (do it yourself) mode to get things the way you want them.",1317945600,2,1298,4.329218106995885
4657454,2,B005D7E80S,"I didn't have huge expectations for this set, and I saw the things posted here.  I didn't believe it as true, but it is, the set build is terrible in quality.  The people who made this like extra sticky hot glue, but then use is sparingly to seal the package and the book that holds the DVDs, half of the seal was coming apart day 1... The outer description is hot glued on with 2 dots of glue. The Book of DVDs had 1 book separate, all of them were a hot glue maniac with preprinted cardboard, the inside ""pages"" were hot glued to the book.

Luckily I got a decent set of dvds vs some of you, only 4 were scratched, and only 1 is that significant, but its ridiculous to see this, the mask is a let down, as I expected it to be my halloween mask... terrible presentation from the start misleading most who bought this (speculation)",1317945600,,831,4.18125
4657455,1,B005D7E80S,"Despite being a lifelong F13 fan, I didn't own any of the movies, and was thrilled to see the deluxe editions from the last couple of years put into a boxset. I didn't care that they weren't Blu-rays, I understood that uncut versions of all films are a logistic impossibility, but that doesn't excuse the pathetic quality control here. The DVDs come in a really nice, compact book that, while informative and cool to look at, scratches the holy hell out of the discs. I immediately removed all the discs and put them into individual CD cases, but even being removed once (with the instructions from the Youtube video) scratched all the discs, some superficially, others much worse. But what REALLY pissed me off is that I received two copies of Part 3, one in place of Part 6. Automated packaging or not, is ANYBODY in the shipping department paying attention? I'm not the most OCD person the world, but having parts 1-8 of a series and missing just part 6 irks the bejezzus out of me. This set is undoubtedly the best value, but beware: there is risk involved.

Oh, and the mask is really cool and detailed. Too bad it's so friggin' small that it could only fit a toddler, who I doubt is in the market for a set of 30 year old, R-rated slasher films.",1317945600,5,1251,4.462882096069869

Despite the mentions of a YouTube video telling you how to remove the disks without scratching them, that MIGHT work only if your packaging isn't defective to begin with.

On the package that I bought, 2 of the pockets that hold the DVDs had come unglued, and the DVDs had fallen into the empty space during shipping.  These discs were not only scratched, but had glue stuck to them - and it's not the kind of glue that can be ""rolled"" off.  It's a sticky, ""gotta use a solvent that's gonna ruin the discs even more"" type of glue.

It comes with a Jason mask (small) that isn't exactly like he one Jason himself wears in the movies, but it's good enough. I don't agree with the way the discs are!

So I took the set back to the store and we opened another set to see if I could swap out the damaged discs, and this set also contained damaged discs (I was able to trade out some of the worst discs for slightly less worse ones, but still ended up in the end, with a set that looked like it had been bought used, as most of the discs still have some degree of playing surface scratches).

It boggles the mind that in this day and age, a company would still package discs in tight, cardboard sleeves, but, there you have it, a relatively nicely priced set, ruined by really crappy packaging.

***NOTE: There's apparently some Youtube video that shows you how to take the discs out of the packaging without scratching them, but the scratches aren't being caused by removing the discs from the packaging but from the discs being slide into the tight cardboard pockets in the factory, to begin with, as I was insanely careful pulling out the 8 discs in first my first set (of which 6 of the 8 discs were severely scratched) and then again with the second set I opened to try and swop out the damaged discs from my first set, and most of those discs had some degree of scratches on them as well.",1317340800,32,1598,4.337792642140468
