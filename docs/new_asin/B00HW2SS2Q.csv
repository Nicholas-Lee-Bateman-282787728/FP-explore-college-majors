8636641,5,B00HW2SS2Q,"I originally discovered this routine on youtube. I moved to an area with horrid internet and bought the DVD. I loved this routine. You focus on all aspects of yoga, in a chair. I have severe arthritis in my knees. I need to sit to work that area. The routine is not introductory but it is not at a high lever either. I find it just right. I like the sound of the instructions and he reminds you consistently of the things we need to be reminded of! Overall, I love this routine and this instructor.",1489190400,2,498,4.197916666666667

8636643,5,B00HW2SS2Q,"Very relaxing and calming practice. I am usually very excitable and tense and I noticed a much improved mood after using this DVD.  I am 71, very active and even though I am in good shape I am noticing aches almost every day.  I am pain free tonight and I think I owe it to Corey and his thoughtful instruction.",1432339200,4,311,4.166666666666667
