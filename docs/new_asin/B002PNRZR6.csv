3965601,1,B002PNRZR6,"THIS WAS A REGION TWO DVD WHICH MEANS IT WOULDN'T PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYERS. I FINALLY GOT IT TO  PLAY ON MY COMPUTER, ONLY TO FIND THAT  THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE WAS FRENCH. AFTER SEVERAL TRYS I DID GET IT TO PLAY IN ENGLISH.

I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SELL A REGION TWO DVD IN A AREA THAT IS MAINLY NOT EQUIPED FOR IT. I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED THAT YOU WQOULD DO SUCH A THING, JUST TO MAKE A SALE.",1376092800,,389,3.8375
3965602,3,B002PNRZR6,"Dan Duryea usually played brashness to an annoying degree - but that is moderated somewhat in this film by a touch of sympathy - he brings life to this film that neither Audie Murphy nor the leading lady - played by pretty but cardboard Joan O'Brien - manage to bring

the plot is the typical ""let's get the lady to where she wants to go"" - but the lady seems to be a highly suspicious character too - and trying to sort these things out made the film fun for me

good pacing - good mystery - good direction by Harry Keller - with excellent visuals by Maury Gertsman - places this one in Murphy's better half",1348876800,3,608,4.188034188034188

3965604,3,B002PNRZR6,"This review is specifically for the Dutch DVD release of this title.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Black-Horses-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Netherlands/dp/B002PNRZR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Black Horses  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Netherlands </a>]

I have quite a few PAL Region 2 DVDs, and usually the picture quality is spectacular, but this one is mediocre at best.  Most DVDs of widescreen movies are done in widescreen; this one is the 1.33:1 ratio one sees with VHS tapes, with large black borders top and bottom, and the sharpness of the picture is mediocre.  Not at all up to standard.

The movie itself is wonderful; one of my favorite Audie Murphy flicks, and with a smashing performance of my favorite good guy/bad guy sidekick, Dan Duryea.  I just wish the picture was better!  Maybe it will be released as a properly done Region 1 DVD some time soon.  I would be first in line!",1281139200,5,963,5.593103448275862
