2359096,4,B000A5045Q,"The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL you

Released in 1997, I Know What You Did Last Summer takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.

This movie is full of slasher clichs, like the killer whos always in the same garb (this time a fishermans slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant Yeah, right scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.

The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.

GRADE: B or B-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (DONT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILM)

Here are the two eye-rolling scenes:

1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.

2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he mightve been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? Its not like she wouldnt have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck?

Sequences like these take mature viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Eberts response: After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did.

=========================

A sequel set in the Bahamas during storm season

Released in 1998, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer chronicles events of the summer after the previous movie. Julie James best friend wins tickets to the Bahamas and so they go down there with their boyfriends (Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood, Mekhi Phifer & Matthew Settle). Shortly after arrival they discover its off-season and storms ensue. Bodies increasingly pile up as Ray from the first film tries to get to the island (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Also on hand are John Black, Jennifer Esposito, Bill Cobbs and Muse Watson.

While I didn't have fond memories of this film, I surprisingly found myself liking it quite a bit on my second viewing. By switching the locations to the Bahamas it completely changes the dynamics even though theres a slicker-killer like the first movie. Suspense slowly builds as the cast is whittled down and the storm rages. It suddenly becomes clear that they're stuck on this vacant resort with a mad killer! Although the filmmakers couldve taken more advantage of the resort location they did a good enough job. Bottom line: This is a worthy sequel with its own appeal.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot at El Tecuan Marina Resort, Costa Careyes, Jalisco, Mexico (standing in for the Bahamas), and USC, Los Angeles, California.

2359228,4,B000A5045Q,"If you're expecting originality you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the superb book this is based on you'll be let down. If you just want to sit down to enjoy a entertaining movie, that is well-acted (the supporting cast (Bridgette Wilson in particular) do as good a job as Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Philippe & Freddie Prince Jr.) you've come to the right page.

Four friends run over a man & dump his dead (?) body into the ocean after their drunken 4th July celebrations. One year later almost to the day, one of the friends receives a letter & the game is on. As it draws to 4th July the letters escalate to hair cutting, disappearing bodies & hit and runs.

I must mention that the main `stalk n slash' scene is gripping, edge-of-your-seat stuff. I wouldn't really call I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER a slasher though; it's more of a suspense thriller. The film focuses revenge.

The film relies on tension & building suspense instead of blood and gore, like classics such as HALLOWEEN. I'm not saying that I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is on that level, but it is well done. The film is better then it's chief comparison SCREAM because it seems more realistic.

I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a huge let down. Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) & her new best buddie Karla (Brandy) win a holiday to the Bahamas. Once there they are stranded after a hurricane warning. The fisherman shows up & starts slicing & dicing.

The sequel is nowhere near the same level as the original. Also the style is different. I KNOW was a clever build-up of tension. I STILL KNOW is all about needless gore, bikinis, tight clothes & cheap scare tactics.

I'll be fair and say that I wasn't bored by I STILL KNOW, the jumps did get me & when the action started I was drawn in to the drama. The film was OK, but it's a let down after seeing what was done first.

The thriller versus the slasher. There is a huge difference. Judge for yourself.",1217289600,3,1991,4.4532967032967035
2359229,5,B000A5045Q,"One of my favorite things to do is sit in front of the television in the middle of the night, and watch a cheesy horror flick. It is extremely fun to do. So, in my mind, you can't go wrong with pretty much any horror film that came out of the nineties - well, anything that came after SCREAM.

I have to say that these two films are dear to my heart. I adore them in all of their gory cheesiness, from Jennifer Love Hewitt's overwrought and occasionally hilarious performance - ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, HUH?!"" - to the ridiculous and implausible storylines, not to mention the rest of the performances from the casts of both films. Here, most of us were introduced to the likes of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze, Jr. Well, that goes for me at least. Some of their careers have prospered, and as for the others, who knows.

With the first film, you have the traditional set up. After a fourth of July party, four teens find themselves in a hit and run situation. The victim dies. Of course, they all freak out and in a desperate attempt to salvage their reputations and avoid time in jail, they agree to dump the body. Well, they attempt to toss him off of a dock at first, but he unexpectantly springs back to life at the last second. Everyone screams, including us in the audience. This doesn't stop them from tossing him in anyways. They all make a pact to never speak of that night. Well, a year passes and they start getting letters that say I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. A man in a slicker with a fish hook starts terrorizing them, and
this is where the fun begins. You all know what happens. B-movie midnight glee! You even get a cameo from Anne Heche! What could possibly go wrong?!

Thankfully, in 1998, only a year after the first film - talk about a rushed production - the folks at Columbia/Tristar gave us I STILL KNOW. Doesn't do as well at the box office, but doesn't entirely fail miserably either. This time, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, and Mekhi Phifer find themselves at the sharp end of the fisherman's hook. Jennifer reprises her role from the first film, as does Freddie Prinze, Jr. This time we find Jennifer's character at college. She is still haunted by the events of the first film, and refuses to go back home to Southport, North Carolina. Another reason that she does not want to go home is because - dun, dun, dunnn! - it is the fourth of July. Freddie tries to convince her to come home for the Croaker Pageant, but she declines, telling him that she's just not ready to go back. Of course, he thinks it's his fault, and sulks away. Little does Jen know that her boyfriend plans on marrying her, and has already bought the ring. In the meantime, her roommate, played by Brandy in a ""so bad it's good"" performance, gets a phone call from a local radio station. They end up winning a free trip to the Bahamas. Well, to make a long story short, they end up in the Bahamas during storm season in a nearly empty hotel. Back home, Freddie runs into the fisherman and heads to the Bahamas in a hurry to save his future fiance. Mekhi Phifer desperately tries to bed Brandy throughout the whole movie, but to no avail. The killer slices and dices various hotel staff, including a pothead - played by none other than an uncredited Jack Black. All the while, Freddie races against time to save his beloved. In a moment of desperation, he hocks her engagement ring for a gun. So sad. So melodramatic. So fun to watch!

Since the first two were released, there has recently been a straight to video sequel, I'LL ALWAYS KNOW. Haven't seen it yet, but it probably doesn't hold a candle to the first two. The SCREAM films were great, don't get me wrong. However, as far as nineties horror films go, these were the best.
