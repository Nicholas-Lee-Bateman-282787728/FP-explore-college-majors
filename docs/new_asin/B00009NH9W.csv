1886317,5,B00009NH9W,"I remember like yesterday sitting in the ""picture show"" with my father dressed in his Sunday Suit and me with my pretty dress on watching The Red Pony.  I must have been about 8 to 10 years old and today I am 65 years of age and I am on Amazon.com about to order the DVD so that I can sit in front of our 62"" plasma with my grandchildren and enjoy ""once again"" the Red Pony as I pass ""them"" the popcorn in a brown paper bag. Such Memories...",1146096000,4,441,3.9
1886318,5,B00009NH9W,"Excellent screen version of John Steinbeck's short novel, with effective and renowned Aaron Copeland score to match. It's more than just a story about a boy and his love for his pony that gets sick and dies; it's about life and fitting in, about who we are and how we choose to be accepted. Everyone does a fine job on the screen. Best perhaps is Louis Calhern as Grandpa, who once led a wagon train across the plains. Robert Mitchum is the laconic ranch hand Billy Buck. Definitely worth a watch.",1126656000,19,497,4.472527472527473
1886319,3,B00009NH9W,"I was told that this movie, unlike Steinbeck's original story, had a happy ending. Well... yes and no. At the very end of the film, everybody's laughing. (A little manaically, in my opinion.) But the movie is still about an unhappy family, and it's full of tense, strained scenes at the breakfast table. Nor does ""happy ending"" mean that we escape the bad things that happen in the book.

There were some nice wildlife and scenery shots of Steinbeck country, but I could have used more.

The children in the film, except for the main character, are horrible yelling little bullies. I took positive delight in their oppression by the very recognizable Wicked Witch of the West as their schoolteacher.

Robert Mitchum's character, who at first is presented as the hero who knows everything there is to know about horses, is gradually revealed as someone who promises more than he can deliver. The uncovering of his flaws and instability is very well done. In general, the movie avoids too much cliche (except in the hokey daydream sequences), and examines its own stereotypes (the old settler, the perfect horse trainer, the incompetent city slicker) in interesting ways.

The parents and grandfather are slightly strange characters, who give the little boy so many conflicting and unspoken commands that I felt very sorry for him trying to grow up in such a crazy environment. Yet it's all under the surface of a wholesome and respectable ranch life. Myrna Loy is cold and gives orders to everyone; she'd be right at home with a riding crop in her hand. She's in the middle between her husband and her father, who have little patience for one another. Mealtime scenes are authentically tense, if not exactly fun to watch.

Aaron Copland's music is given high billing, but if you've heard the suite, you've heard all the good stuff. A lot of the score is boilerplate with just a hint of Copland's style.

This movie is not for kids. It's quite disturbing in a subtle way that gets under your skin. I'll be thinking about it long after watching it.

The DVD has no features other than ""play movie"" and scene selection. The movie is in Technicolor.",1124668800,21,2144,4.778378378378378
1886320,4,B00009NH9W,"This is a fine family film with a first rate cast, based on Steinbeck's short stories of course. The score by Aaron Copland is just great, as is the photography by Tony Gaudio. It's one of the very few times Republic Pictures used Technicolor instead of their inferior two color Trucolor system. Even though the packaging proclaims ""Digitally Mastered from the Original Film Negative"", it's just so-so quality wise, about equal to the earlier Laserdisc release. Technicolor can and should look much better than this! The packaging also indicates the original theatrical trailer is included (as it was on the Laserdisc) but I couldn't find it on the DVD. Apparently Artisan just doesn't care much about their classic film library, unless John Wayne is involved, and even there some of the end product is mediocre (such as ""The Quiet Man""). Don't hold your breath waiting for a restoration or special edition from these clowns. It's a very good film and the price is right. Buy it!",1121990400,2,979,4.903614457831325
1886321,5,B00009NH9W,"In an effort to connect with his son, Fred Tiflin (Louis Calhern) buys him a pony: A fantastic cinnamon red colored pony with a white blaze and a flowing creamy mane and tail. Fred is dismayed when young Tom (Peter Miles) turns to the ranch-hand (Robert Mitchum) instead of him for help in training the unbroken gelding and gets even more fed up when the pony, named Gabilan, becomes Tom's singular obsession. Drama and tragedy take center stage, but there is plenty of pony for fans of the Welsh breed. This movie was remade for TV in 1978, but somebody got the definition of ""pony"" confused with ""foal"" and a Thoroughbred colt was cast as Gabilan. Based on a short story called The Promise in a collection entitled The Red Pony by John Steinbeck.

Recommended-Growing Up on A Ranch/Farm In California.
No Menu and No Xtras.
6 Act's In this according to the title's In this movie.
Funniest Part was when Jody was helping his Father and he fell off the Roof,boy was he Mad!
'You'll Be Sorry,You'll Be Sorry.'
He should have been wearing shoes and not barefoot like he always was must have had strong feet.
Jack Elam summed It up best by saying-'The Boy's Having Himself Quite A Day Isn't He?'
Look for Hop Sing from Bonanza In this as the Bartender and of course Rance Howard as the Sheriff.
You knew that Gitano and the Older Horse went away to Die together.
Bar Fight was good
Sad-the Little Red Pony and the Vultures.
Sad-Nellie giving Birth,Great Ending though.
You'd also think that Carl and Jess would work together as they were very close friends.
Jess could help with the roof and Carl could help with the wagon and whatever else needed to be done.
Carl was A good father trying to teach the boy about things at times,not all the time lacked patience.
Jess and Carl also liked to drink especially Jess and that's not good when your raising A large family.
He has 9 kids so stay out of the bars and away from the women and be A father to your kids.

1886389,5,B00009NH9W,"Republic Pictures was at the top of the heap down on Poverty Row. They were the ""A"" studio of ""B"" pictures who specialized in Westerns (John Wayne & Gene Autry got their start there) and Serials (THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL, THE LONE RANGER). The company was founded in 1935 and produced and released films until 1959. Their trademark logo of a giant eagle perched atop a craggy mountain peak is still in use today. After World War II Republic began to produce the occasional ""prestige"" picture which had a bigger budget and name stars and directors. John Ford did THE QUIET MAN (1952) there, Orson Welles did a highly stylized version of MACBETH (1948), Fritz Lang made the creepy and disturbing HOUSE BY THE RIVER (1951), and Lewis Milestone (ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT) made this film in 1949. It was one of the few color movies to come from Republic (THE QUIET MAN is another). I see that here and on imdb that a number of people point out that it isn't faithful to John Steinbeck's book. That is true but as Steinbeck himself wrote the screenplay, then at least he had a hand in the finished product and he didn't complain about it.

For years THE RED PONY has only been available in washed out, substandard prints first on VHS and then later on low budget DVD. This new version from Olive Films goes back to the best source material and looks and sounds gorgeous. The sound is equally important for the film's score was written by Aaron Copland. Now it can be heard in all of its glory. If you know the orchestral suite than you'll recognize it immediately throughout the film. The casting is perfect with Myrna Loy wonderfully understating the role of the mother who is estranged from her husband. Veteran thespian Louis Calhern makes the talkative grandfather come alive, and Robert Mitchum (31 when this film was made) gets the opportunity to play a gentler character much like he would later do in RYAN'S DAUGHTER. The story of a young boy learning to raise a pony and the responsibilities it entails never becomes too sentimental or cloying thanks to Steinbeck's screenplay and Milestone's creative direction. It is quite obvious that Walt Disney, who had yet to produce a full length live action feature, took this movie as his template. If you've never seen THE RED PONY or haven't seen it in years then you need to see this version. It looks even better now thematically as well as visually then it did in 1949.",1382400000,7,2434,4.6342592592592595

1886404,5,B00009NH9W,"A lifelong Maureen O'Hara fan, this film was one of the few of hers that seems to elude me over the years. Finally, thanks to the wise folks at Universal, it is available!

I was so excited to receive my copy, and I watched it right away. I loved it! Henry Fonda gives a great performance, and it is always nice to see folks like Jack Elam, Rance Howard, and Clint Howard too. They all give great performances as well. Maureen O'Hara's work in this film though is amazing! There was one scene in particular that I just watched her in awe. She had her back to the camera, and I think she is a better actress with just the back of her head than some of today's actresses with their whole body.

I highly recommend this DVD. It is an excellent film with fine performances. Certainly if you are a Maureen O'Hara or Henry Fonda fan, you definitely need this in your collection.",1353801600,5,872,4.310975609756097

1886406,5,B00009NH9W,"Even though it's not released at this writing, I can definitely offer a review of this marvelous family film. As editor of the official Maureen O'Hara website, and Maureen's archivist for the past 20 years, I have been privileged to see the movie courtesy of Universal Studios some years ago.  Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara are fantastic with that same wonderful chemistry they had in ""Spencer's Mountain"" in 1963 - (They also costarred in ""The Immortal Sergeant"" in 1943.) This  made-for-TV film from 1972 won the coveted ""Peabody Award"" for TV excellence that year. At that time stage actress Shirley Booth told the press that Maureen's performance was one of the best she'd ever seen. So buy this one with confidence people; it's warm and gentle and delivers a meaningful lesson about respect.  For more promotional info come to the Facebook page and should you want to send a message to Maureen after seeing the film, I'll see to it that she gets your review. I have campaigned to get this released to DVD for over ten years..... and now it's finally happening!  Thanks so much Universal.  Enjoy!

1886407,5,B00009NH9W,"If you are looking for a film that follows the book closely, you will be disapointed.  Entire sections of the book were left out of the film and the character's names have been changed.  Yet, the movie is well done and gives a unique look into early American rural life.  The film was shot in the Santa Barbara region and gives a great insight into that area's scenery.  I used the film in a class that I had taught and found it most fitting to show a comparison between the genre of novel and film.",1304899200,,499,4.221052631578948

1886409,3,B00009NH9W,"If you read Steinbeck's novel of the same title already, either lower your expectations for the film, don't watch it, or watch it as if it's a different story.

Shepperd Strudwick does a fine job acting as the petty, mean-spirited, controlling Fred Tiflin. Decent performances were also delivered by Myrna Loy as Alice, Peter Miles as the boy Tom, Robert Mitchum as cowboy Billy Buck and Louis Calhern as Grandfather. Robert Mitchum as Billy Buck seemed an odd choice as the novel made one expect an older, heavier man. Poor acting didn't kill this film, the rewriting did. Instead of making the audience cope with Billy Buck bludgeoning to death the pregnant mare to save her colt, the writers decided to have all the fuss about how to safely deliver the breech position colt resolved with an easy delivery. Problem solved! No fuss, no muss. My 8-year old thought the ending was funny because everyone was laughing, but I found it odd.

In a nutshell, the acting of Myrna Loy and Robert Mitchum matched with a score by Aaron Copland couldn't rescue the screen adaptation from Hollywood schmaltz.",1227052800,,1096,4.824468085106383
1886410,4,B00009NH9W,"The most truly American of classical composers, Aaron Copland's stirring music score is what still resonates most in this almost forgotten 1949 film, even though it boasts an impressive pedigree - a screenplay by John Steinbeck based on his own collection of short stories, direction from film veteran Lewis Milestone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Quiet-on-the-Western-Front/dp/B000KGGJ0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Quiet on the Western Front</a>, Steinbeck's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Mice-and-Men/dp/6305081832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Mice and Men</a>), and A-list stars in Robert Mitchum and Myrna Loy. It was the most expensive picture ever made at Republic Studios, a poverty-row operation that was kept afloat thanks to a successful string of John Wayne westerns. On the surface, the movie seems like kid-friendly fare, but it also presents some interesting psychological subtext on the family unit and a surprisingly graphic scene that triggers the story's climax.

The story focuses on a young boy named Tom Tiflin, who lives with his parents on a ranch in the Salinas Valley. His no-nonsense mother Alice was raised in the area, but his emotionally indifferent father Fred comes from San Jose and has never felt at home despite spending years on the ranch. On a long-term visit to the ranch, Alice's father is an old coot who repeats the same stories about the old West much to the consternation of Fred. Moreover, Fred's constantly conflicted state has pushed Tom closer to devoted ranch hand Billy Buck. Family tensions give way to a red pony, Fred's present to Tom. Naturally, the boy focuses his full attention on the pony, even cutting class to take care of it after it ambled outside during a heavy rainstorm. The rest of the story plays the way one would expect from a parable about personal obligations and coping with tragedy. Milestone lends a painterly quality to the proceedings, but he doesn't delve deeply into the characters' motivations. This was probably an intentional decision since the picture seems designed to be more of a Disney-type live-action film. The superficial treatment, however, leaves some aspects of the story oddly unexplained.

The resulting lapse leaves the actors to fill in the blanks. Even in a sketchily written role like Billy, Mitchum exudes his famously coiled presence in the face of a character that seems too good to be true. Stripped of her sophisticated charms, a ghostly-looking Loy lends a stoic dignity to Alice that gives just a small glimpse into the marital struggles her character is obviously facing. A year away from playing his archetypal role of Oliver Wendell Holmes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Yankee/dp/630292295X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Yankee</a>, Louis Calhern brings bluster and unexpected poignancy to the grandfather. As Fred, Steinbeck look-alike Shepperd Strudwick does the best he can in a relatively thankless role. Nine-year-old Peter Miles is generally affecting as Tom, though he can't seem to get past the boy's obsession into something more moving. That is indeed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Witch-of-the-West/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Witch of the West</a>, Margaret Hamilton, playing a minor role as Tom's perturbed schoolteacher.
