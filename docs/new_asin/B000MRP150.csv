8735175,5,B000MRP150,"I have pretty much the entire series - my 7 year old nephew loves it, as does my 4 year old daughter, who seems to be hypnotized by the show.  Based on the material in the show, you wouldn't think kids would like it so much - after all, it's really just a tour through various zoos in the US, but guess what?  Every kid I've shown this too adores it!  It's professionally done, and something about the host just seems to click with the kids.  A great way to keep the kids entertained and educated at the same time.",1220227200,,514,4.11
