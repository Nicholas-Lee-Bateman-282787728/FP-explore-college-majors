4708393,5,B005IA9JVI,"Dear FRIENDS,

Oh how you've made me laugh and cry all within 22 minutes.  Even now all 10 seasons are on Netflix, I occasionally will still come back to these, because the DVDS are the extended versions with lots of deleted scenes, which I think some of them are the funniest.",1441238400,,277,4.411764705882353

4708411,5,B005IA9JVI,"Everyone should have at least a couple of seasons of ""Friends"".  Whenever I am stressed or have had a bad day, I pull out the ""Friends"" DVDs.

4708415,5,B005IA9JVI,"This show is still consistently funny after all these years. I remember the gist of most episodes but was still laughing out loud. The non-Blu-Ray ['Regular-Ray' as I prefer to call it], is good enough considering the price is half of Blu-Ray. This version also contains extra footage the Blu-Ray doesn't. Though not a deal-breaker, it is a mild annoyance that the Blu-Ray lacks this feature.",1412899200,,392,4.954545454545454

4708431,3,B005IA9JVI,"The price and value on Amazon for the 2 seasons is great, but not all the episodes play. I see others have had problems with not all the discs or episodes working either so be careful purchasing this. If all discs came and appeared new without scratches, I would give it 5 stars.

4708440,5,B005IA9JVI,"I bought this for my girlfriend for a Christmas present. Needless to say we are both Friends fans. For $20 it was definitely worth it. One thing I particularly like is the fact on these seasons have extended episodes that Blu-ray versions DO NOT include! Half these scenes and episodes we not even shown on TV, so its a nice perk to buy the DVD versions instead of the Blu-rays. I highly recommend getting these instead of the Blu-ray versions for this reason!",1391558400,4,460,4.554216867469879
4708441,5,B005IA9JVI,"I purchased these DVDs for my video library. All are good fun and full of memorable moments. These earlier seasons do not have the blooper compliations, but offer several other interactive games that are fun as well.",1390608000,,216,4.864864864864865

4708456,2,B005IA9JVI,"ATTENTION:The show itself is great. I thought this was an amazing deal but upon watching the actual discs it was terrible. Each disc had  episodes that either totally wouldn't play or would only play the first few minutes and then return to the menu. This was a complete riff off, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this dvd set!!!",1384387200,8,336,4.508196721311475

this one has the bonus scenes so if you like BLOOPERS get this! and plus PRIME SHIPPING come on, 2 day shipping, you can't beat that!

and I love this better than the WHOLE set because this is more organize. The bulk set is more for regular people, but if your a true friends fan, then you should get this!",1383782400,,402,4.207792207792208

4708461,5,B005IA9JVI,I love the Friends series.  Nice to have them on hand to watch whenever.  The whole season is in one case...conveniently placing all 4 discs together.  So 2 seasons doens't take up a lot of space.,1382918400,,196,4.388888888888889
4708462,3,B005IA9JVI,"I really enjoy watching Friends and was thrilled to find value-pack prices for the DVD's on Amazon. However, I've watched all of seasons 1 and 2 and have found at least one episode per disc won't play. Some discs won't ""play all"" and some episodes only play the first minute and then return to the main menu.

This might be overlooked had it only happened with one disc, but it occurs on every single disc. I'm led to believe these are cheap copies and I'm hoping they aren't pirated. :-(

I'm quite disappointed in the purchase.",1381190400,20,529,4.5
4708463,5,B005IA9JVI,"I couldn't believe how fast it got here. I loved the shipping time, btw...

On to the actual product, I loved it. I was around with the show was in it's third season, but not when it started, so I wasn't able to watch the entire show. I didn't know anything about the show's character development, and I just thought it was just a stupid show. I saw a rerun recently and thought it was HILARIOUS. I loved it... It was like, one of the best TV comedies I've seen, seriously. I would  recommend this to anyone. I'm not even joking. I liked the way the packaging was, I thought it would have both seasons in one combo pack, but they were separate DVD cases with each season in both of them. I really enjoy it and think everyone should watch it, even though it's an older show.",1379894400,,773,4.216216216216216

4708465,2,B005IA9JVI,I am pretty displeased with the first and second season friends dvd series that I have ordered. I have just recently finished watching all the dvds and on almost every single disk there are 2 or 3 of the episodes that won't play through. a few seconds of the show starts and then it clicks back to the menu as if the episode cannot be read.,1378252800,16,340,4.166666666666667
4708466,5,B005IA9JVI,"I never watched Friends when it orginally aired, except for a few episodes here and there, so the show was always a bit sketchy because I did not know the plot nor the characters very well. After watching the first few seasons, I am hooked: excellent casting, acting, and writing make this show very funny and heartwarming. I have a emotional connection with all six of the main characters, so I have watched the first four seasons twice, and the second time around was just as entertaining.",1377993600,,491,4.655172413793103
