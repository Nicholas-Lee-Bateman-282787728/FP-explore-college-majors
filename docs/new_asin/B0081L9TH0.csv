5118471,5,B0081L9TH0,My son loves this collection - great to have had it on time as well!  Thank you!,1421020800,,80,3.7058823529411766
5118472,4,B0081L9TH0,Arrived new. Was part of a Christmas present for my niece. Very happy with delivery.,1419811200,,84,4.666666666666667
5118473,1,B0081L9TH0,"This is a blatant rip-off of Disney/Pixar's Cars. Don't waste your money on this carp, even if you think 8 movies for 5 or so dollars is a bargin! The animation is poor, the voices are beyond irritating,  and I swear that the yellow taxi car boss is, no offense, mentally challenged (look at his eyes,)! I guarantee that kids will be bored stiff with the ""jokes"" provided by those ""Little Cars"" (who aren't little by the way, just so you know). If you like terrible movies then this may provide some unintentional entertainment just like the company's other rip-offs. Again, save your money and go for the real deals: Cars and Cars 2 from Disney/Pixar. Parents, is you do buy this for your kids or somehow own it already, well... don't say I didn't warn you...",1403308800,,760,4.547445255474453
5118474,5,B0081L9TH0,My grandson who is almost 3 and loves cars watched this video until he almost wore it out.  Great value because it contains series 1-8,1398038400,,134,4.36
8524042,5,B0081L9TH0,"My 2 year old nephew loves cars. Its hard to keep him occupied, however with this dvd he will sit and watch over and over again.",1514419200,,128,3.9615384615384617
8524043,5,B0081L9TH0,"My son loves this series. We originally received a used disk with one episode from a friend, and it was badly damaged, so I ordered this for him and he was super excited! We haven't actually watched it yet so I can't attest to the condition of the disks.",1505865600,,254,4.204081632653061
8524044,1,B0081L9TH0,"Very poor quality animation and although they have 8 films, each movie is only about 30 minutes. My son usually loves most any cars videos, but he hated this because it was so bad. Looks like it was made by a junior high student. Even if your child loves cars, they won't like this. I regret I bought this waste of money.",1487980800,3,321,4.193548387096774
8524045,5,B0081L9TH0,The crisp and fluid animation sets this series apart from other animated car stories for children. The rich storyline and perfectly synched dubbing makes me question whether the original was made in Brazil! Perfect to show your children right before they go to bed. Go take a bath get a glass of wine and enjoy yourself you deserve it. Raising three kids by yourself is difficult.,1483747200,2,380,4.7727272727272725
8524046,5,B0081L9TH0,"My toddler loves it, nicely drawn, I read the reviews, that somebody didn't like the sound, but I think its quite good.",1483315200,,119,4.454545454545454

8524048,5,B0081L9TH0,I bought this for a friend of mine's little boy he's almost 2 years old he will watch this over and over (about 40 times) and my best friend jokes with me and tells me thanks a lot for this movie .... but really he does love it a lot !! so WIN for the best friend a loss for the mom :) haha because she has to watch it LOL,1457654400,,322,3.5492957746478875
8524049,2,B0081L9TH0,"I purchased for my 4 year old twin grandso9ns, they watched it twice and never have wanted to look at it again",1438473600,,110,4.045454545454546
8524050,2,B0081L9TH0,rather slow kids were not really into it them.,1431216000,,46,4.222222222222222
