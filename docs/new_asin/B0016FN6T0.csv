8288975,4,B0016FN6T0,"With this video, I was expecting more of a history of the US Marshals from 1789 through today. The video did give a little about the 17 and 1800's, but from my own research, they definitely left things out from those eras. The video mostly portrayed the Marshals missions and duties from the segregation era. Although is was an accurate and honorable depiction, The Marshal Service did more than just provide protection for a few important people. Plus, the video simply shows that the Marshals know how to stand their ground and take a beating without violating the civil rights of Americans. The video does give great respect and regard to the Marshals mission of that time, but there are so many other missions and duties which the Marshals performed and are responsible for. This video should have been relabeled "" US Marshals Integration in the South.""",1359590400,,857,4.836734693877551
