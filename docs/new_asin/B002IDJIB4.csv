After some serious effort we did get it registered. I like the information. The only thing I would change is instead of moving automatically from chapter to chapter sequentially, I wish it would let me start each subsequent chapter. Cubase is pretty similar 4 through 6 so if you need a sequential video, ask video knows how to help.",1362873600,,475,4.409090909090909
8370828,5,B002IDJIB4,"Having gone through the first few chapters of Cubase 5 Level One, I can tell you that the quality of the instruction is very high. The beginning of the video starts with system setup and proceeds sequentially covering topics in order of complexity. The narration is very clear, as are the graphics and video navigation. The only things I would want done differently is to have a full screen mode and a minimize button and maybe some actual practice files to work on.

Cubase 5 is a large and comprehensive audio program. Learning to use it requires considerable effort. It is much more entertaining to watch Cubase 5 Video Tutorial then read the rather boring manual. You are more likely stick with learning Cubase and also remember how to use it. For those reasons, it is well worth the price.",1279065600,,794,4.671428571428572
