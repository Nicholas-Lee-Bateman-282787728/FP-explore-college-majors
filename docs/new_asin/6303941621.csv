7855970,5,6303941621,"In this hysterical episode, Wishbone plays the character Odysseus in Homer's the Odyssey. Odysseus is prisoner of the goddess Calypso. Odysseus has an enemy as well named Poseidon god of the sea. Odysseus must escape the goddess and get past Poseidon to get back home and save his family. Back in Oakdale a big developer is trying to turn Joe and his friend's favorite hangout (Jackson Park) into a parking lot for a new restaurant. But Joe, Samantha, David, and of course Wishbone aren't going to let that happen without a fight!

Wow, what a great episode this one was, because this kind of stuff happens in real life. (Talking about the developer trying to cut down the trees in Jackson Park) It always stinks when nature gets destroyed because some people want to make an extra few bucks and this episode really teaches children and adults to stand up for what they think is right.

Well to cut to the chase this is a great episode and you gotta go watch it! : )",1243382400,,966,4.514285714285714
7855971,4,6303941621,"""Homer Sweet Homer"" is one of the rare episodes of ""Wishbone,"" the creative kid's show about the world's most imaginative Jack Russell terriers, where the story and the literary work do not fit properly.  In the real world a developer has come to Oakdale to destroy Jackson Park and the kid's favorite tree.  Of course, they band together to fight the good fight.  Meanwhile, Wishbone is imagining himself to be Odysseus involved in a heroic quest to save his home.  I can accept that the kids are involved in a quest of sorts, but Homer's ""Odyssey"" is more about trying to get home, not to save it, per se, and does not involve any sort of physical destruction of property (Penelope just claims to have moved their bed, the headboard of which is a tree; it is never in danger).  Maybe the writers were just too enamored with their cute title for this episode.  However, apart from that one complaint, which will not occur to the countless elementary school students who have yet to get around to reading Homer's epic poem, this is a solid episode of the series.  Kids are never too young to learn that if they band together in a righteous cause it is possible they can win out against the big bad world.",1009670400,3,1204,4.52073732718894
