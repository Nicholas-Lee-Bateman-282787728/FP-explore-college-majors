7804194,5,6300181332,"If you told Loretta Lynn she was the female Elvis, she would probably reply Elvis is the male Loretta.  I saw her little sister in Reno some time ago, and the concert was great.  I've seen her elsewhere, but something about Reno seemed to best reflect the country aspect of her performance.  So I figured this would probably be good too, with the Reno location.  I was wrong - it's great!  Loretta belts out her hits just like Elvis did.  Whether you like country music or not, you'll enjoy this performance.  Perfect costumes, hair, songs, and band.  She even performs ""In the Ghetto"".  It's too bad she never worked with Elvis.  They had a very similar style of performing.  A real American lady.",1444089600,,698,4.59349593495935
