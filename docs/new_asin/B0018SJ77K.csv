3421182,5,B0018SJ77K,"I've always loved orcas, especially since the Keiko saga. Not having educated myself on their strong family bonds and their cruel confinement, I too thought that those that are kept and made to perform several shows a day, the same act, over and over for a bit of fish at the 3 SeaWorld parks and the joke of a park at Miami where happy!! It wasn't until I read Death At SeaWorld by David Kirby and watched this sad video that I begain to change my mind and have become involved in helping to release these magnificant animals back to the wild - where they belong. Poor ""Lolita"" has been at that miserable park for 40 YEARS, 30 BY HERSELF!!! I could go on and on, but you will see for yourself how sad her confinement is - she needs help for all of us, even if in some small way. Send e-mails to your all your  contacts asking them to contact their contacts and maybe, just maybe someone with some clout can do the right thing for this animal who has no voice and  who has given so much of her life to the Hertz family. She is still a viable female orca, who could produce young in the wild - they can live 80-90 yrs....she could help repopulate the depleated numbers in the wild. Please watch this video - it will touch your life.",1347580800,14,1231,4.211864406779661
3421183,4,B0018SJ77K,"This movie (I watched it through instant streaming) has vital information about the horrible ways that we have treated (and continue to treat) marine mammals in captivity. From the beginning, it explains the brutal ways that mammals like Lolita and the many ""Shamu"" whales have been captured. I am an avid fan of marine mammals and read much about them and their bioligy. But a lot of the information presented here, specifically about Orcas, was new to me.

I encourage you to watch it and prepare to be saddened and shocked. Get angry...and then get motivated to do something about the horrors you see here.",1326240000,6,609,4.8
3421184,1,B0018SJ77K,"it may be good that they show the truth about lolita but seaworld san diego, seaworld orlando and seaworld san antonio have nothing to do with it. the only people that are to blame are those of miami seaquarium. seaworld is not a bad facility. miami seaquarium on the other hand is one of the worst around",1320019200,4,305,4.368421052631579
3421185,5,B0018SJ77K,"Everyone should see this video.  Especially if they are planning on going to Sea World or any other Aquarium park. People just don't realize what they support when they buy a ticket, but this shows it all.  A must see!",1307923200,3,218,4.425
3421186,5,B0018SJ77K,"This documentary uncovers the real world of life in captivity for these beautiful, intelligent animals- the magnificent Orcas. It is similar to The Cove in that some of it is upsetting, but it will open you eyes and inspire you to help.",1302307200,6,236,4.642857142857143
3421187,5,B0018SJ77K,I say very interesting because who knew what went on behind closed doors. Its a massive shame that the contents of thid DVD have not been broadcast on TV. More people need to see it or how are we going to educate people and stop them visiting these places? 'Fall from Freedom' is also a great DVD to watch if this subject interests you.,1267920000,13,336,4.265625
3421188,5,B0018SJ77K,"Slave to Entertainment is a documentary about the marine mammal industry. Most notably, Lolita, an orca who languishes in a tank that is too small for her at the Miami Seaquarium.

Lolita was captured 39 years ago on August 8, 1970. Not only was she captured that day, five others orcas were also captured and five were killed. Four of those killed were babies who were trying desperately to get back to their mothers. They repeatedly pushed up against the net, where their mothers waited on the other side. But they were not successful and drowned. People often ask why they didn't just jump over, but since they had never encountered a net before, they had no idea that if they jumped over, they would be free.

In order to hide their heinous deed, those responsible for the deaths had the bellies of the dead orcas slit, filled with rocks, and weighted with chains and anchors. They were taken out to sea in the dark of night and sunk to keep their deaths from coming to the attention of the public. However, this did not work. Three of the carcasses washed up on the shore of Whidbey Island during the month of November, 1970. The other ended up in a fisherman's net. The fisherman left the dead orca on the beach behind the house of a reporter for the Seattle Times.

Six years later, a judge reviewed the evidence against Sea World, who was in charge of the capture team. Sea World was banned from capturing Orcas in the state of Washington, but it was too late for those captured. They had already been sold to aquariums around the world.  Of these, only Lolita is still alive. Howard Garrett of Orca Network said, ""It in simply her remarkable spirit that has kept her alive this long.""

Slave to Entertainment is an excellent film and one everyone should see.",1249776000,34,1767,4.544025157232705
3421189,5,B0018SJ77K,"""Lolita: Slave to Entertainment"" is without doubt one of the finest documentaries on animal issues. It is fun to watch, and full of fascinating interviews with folks such as Ric O'Barry, once Flipper's trainer, and now a dolphin rescuer.  And it delivers some shocking information about the marine mammal industry. This is a fantastic film to watch with your family and friends who wonder why you won't go visit marine mammal parks with them.",1215475200,14,442,4.972972972972973
3421190,5,B0018SJ77K,"This is a great documentary introducing viewers to both Lolita's situation and the truth behind the captive marine mammal industry.  It is a real eye-opener, and well worthwhile for anyone to watch.  You will never see a marine park in the same light again.",1133049600,4,257,4.818181818181818
3421212,4,B0018SJ77K,"This film just breaks my heart. I honestly always assumed the animals in these parks were there because they were rescues, but they're hunted down and captured just to perform for our entertainment, that's horrible. People make an argument it's educational. What are we learning by watching a whale out of its natural environment performing tricks for food.",1428883200,,357,5.172413793103448
3421213,5,B0018SJ77K,This was very educational for me and heartbreaking at the same time.,1428019200,,68,4.75
3421214,5,B0018SJ77K,Incredible journey of the loneliest orca on this planet - 44 years of captivity just waiting to go home- she has the best chance to be released back to her native waters and reunite with her family who is still swimming free in the Pacific Northwest - a must buy!,1414195200,,263,4.28
3421215,5,B0018SJ77K,"Very good documentary which tells what really goes on at the Miami Seaquarium.  They really need to release this poor girl, especially because they know where her family pod is, and has her mother narrowed down to 2 whales.",1407888000,,223,4.717948717948718
3421216,5,B0018SJ77K,A very eye opening documentary on Lolita who has been living alone in deplorable conditions at the Miami Seaquarium for 40+ years in a tank that does not meet regulations.,1405987200,,171,4.733333333333333
3421217,5,B0018SJ77K,"I've seen this on youtube. it's an eye opener. It teaches us the truth about captivity Mainly about Lolita in this title. When God made the earth. He made two spaces. Earth and Sea. Man does not have the right to kidnap our sea life for mans intertwinement. I also have the movie called ""The Cove"" and ""A Fall From Freedom"" is a follow up on ""The Cove"" One way to stop all this is NOT TO BUY THE TICKET. AKA. Do not support the water parks where they have these animals. change.org has potions you can sign to voice your feelings. fight for their freedom. Thank you.",1405814400,2,566,4.25

3421219,4,B0018SJ77K,"you get such a better understanding on what we (people) do for entertainment.  This beautiful creature is being abused, for our enjoyment while she suffers in a small tank, alone, starved to preform, and dying before our vary eyes. Don't buy a ticket to one of these shows, it just makes the problem worse.  I have joined the wish being put out to free Lolita, let her live her life like she was meant to.  Free and unharmed by human kind. let her experience her days with her family, and possibly even as a mother. let her enjoy her life, she has given us enough entertainment. free her from slavery! End this cruel treatment. these animals need our protection not our indifference. Watch this video, and watch BLACKFISH. you will forever be changed.",1398124800,,751,4.631578947368421
3421220,4,B0018SJ77K,"I expected more for $20. While this is very informative, in most of the documentary the picture quality is awful. It gets so pixelated at points that you can't make out much. For a 2008 (???!!!) release I expected at least a bit better quality. It is not widescreen, either, it's square (perhaps made for TV). Overall it is educational so it's worthwhile to watch.

A lot of the people interviewed in this are also in ""Blackfish"" so I haven't learned much new information from this documentary. (I highly recommend Blackfish to those who haven't seen it.)

Definitely not worth the $20 as is - maybe $10 on the high end. It gets 4 stars for picture quality.",1394323200,,657,4.559322033898305
3421221,4,B0018SJ77K,"Another heartbreaking look at how cruel humans can be. Lolita lives in a space that is illegally far too small for an animal her size to be kept in...does anyone do anything about it? No. Lolita lives alone, in a tank that is too small, where she is forced to perform the same monotonous tricks over and over again all in the name of entertainment. She has made the owner of Miami Seaquarium millions of dollars, and yet he can't be bothered to update her living space. God forbid he would agree to return her to the wild so she could rejoin her pod. This is another incredibly sad and horrific look at how animals are treated.",1391212800,,627,4.367521367521367
3421222,5,B0018SJ77K,It is an eye opening documentary. It leaves you questioning so much and asking yourself...What have we done? Why do we continue to do it?,1390003200,,137,4.52
3421223,5,B0018SJ77K,This is a documentary that shows how the greed of some people make these beautiful creatures literal slaves. Anyone  thinking of visiting Sea World or any other Aquarium park should watch this first. This is what your money is supporting when you purchase a ticket.,1389484800,,265,4.888888888888889
3421224,4,B0018SJ77K,"It is a good documentary. I first watched black fish and The Whale. Those 2 are great.
This one talks about Lolita an actively captive orca at Seaquarium in Florida. This documentary covers a bit of the intelligence of these animals. The film is a bit old. But still good to watch.",1387843200,,281,4.423076923076923
3421225,5,B0018SJ77K,If you want to learn about the negative side of killer whale captivity you will like this movie.  Good movie documenting the life of Lolita and the effect captivity has had on this cetacean and the fight for her release from her concrete prison.,1386892800,,245,4.568181818181818
3421226,4,B0018SJ77K,"Very well done documentary about Tokitae (Lolita) and her 30+ year plight in the Miami Seaquarium. I hope more filmmakers & journalists will tackle the issue of Cetaceans in captivity for entertainment and profits, and put an end to it once and for all. She deserves to come home to her family here in Puget Sound. I can't recommend this movie enough for people who don't know her story.",1386633600,,387,4.6231884057971016
3421227,5,B0018SJ77K,"Such a sad look at how sea mammals are treated in captivity. Orcas are so much smarter than we think! THe name of the movie suits this movie, SLAVE they are, SLAVE they should never be!",1384905600,3,185,4.166666666666667
3421228,5,B0018SJ77K,This is such an influential film exposing the sad greed behind organizations that keep Killer Whales in captivity for profit under the guise of education. Very revealing.,1383696000,2,170,5.333333333333333
3421229,5,B0018SJ77K,Lolita deserves everyone's attention and she must be released back to her home in Puget Sound! I cannot believe this facility is still open with it's outdated codes and dilapidated state.  How horribly cruel to keep Lolita in a tiny pool and in solitary captivity for decades!,1377907200,2,276,4.872340425531915
3421230,5,B0018SJ77K,"This was a very good documentary that shows accurate scientific information (for the time it was made) regarding whales in the wild and in captivity.  I didn't know much about Lolita but now after watching this movie I can say that her situation is unfortunate and I hope many people watch this movie so that we can educate the world about her sad life which like Rick O'Barry mentioned, it is not life she's just surviving.

The last time a documentary made me cry like this was when I watched The Cove. It breaks my heart to see these animals being treated this way because it is a reflection of our society. We need to educate ourselves, our families and our friends and maybe one day this billion dollar industry will be a thing of the past.
Please do not buy a ticket to seaworld, miami seaquariom, loro parque and other bathtubs for whales. It's the right thing to do.",1364688000,2,874,4.45625
3421231,5,B0018SJ77K,This story really touched my heart as I listened to what happened to Lolita.  I do what I can to help captured whales but I wish more people would also.  This whale needs to be set free and we need more people to know and help out. Thank you.,1354492800,5,242,3.9183673469387754
8271077,3,B0018SJ77K,"This documentary was interesting but inflammatory. Of course I felt sorry for Lolita and the park that held her should be ashamed of themselves. At the same time, I do think there is a place for human and orca interaction as a means to learn more about these magnificent creatures.",1473033600,,281,4.64

8271081,5,B0018SJ77K,"Very eye opening documentary about what Sea World has done to some of the most beautiful creatures in our world. We used this to teach our children how important it is to protect our environment and respect animals, wildlife and sea mammals that have been placed in this world. We are now actively following the story of Lolita and are throwing as much support for creating awareness of her situation to anyone we can. This Orca should never have been kept in captivity and has essentially spent more time in prison that many people who commit murder. For now, she continues to sit on ""death row"", as keeping her locked up is ultimately going to be a death sentence for her. I encourage everyone to see this video!",1458259200,,714,4.5859375
