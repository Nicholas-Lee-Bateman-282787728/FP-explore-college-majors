If you find this in a bargain bin somewhere for $1, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, I would pass.",1433116800,,254,4.122448979591836

8560797,5,B00B1FXM4O,"I'll go right to the point: this is one funny movie. When I saw the cover of the DVD, I sincerely did not know what to expect, only that it was a Japanese film, described as a sexy comedy. But it is more than that, and, after watching it, you'll feel that you watched something special.

Kenichi Tadokoro (Tasuko Nagaoka) is a college student who joins a group that writes erotic literature. He is young and inexperienced, and the task seems enormous to him. However, Mayama ((Noriko Eguchi), the only female in the group, quickly learns that Tadokoro is a virgin, and slowly seduces him. Tadokoro, of course, is having the time of his life, as Mayama is pretty much experienced in the sexual arts. However, after one lovemaking session, Mayama tells Tadokoro, ""Thanks for helping with my research."" It happens that Mayama was using him for inspiration and data gathering for her next book. His colleagues at the group inform him that ""Mayama will do anything for her writing."" At the beginning he is hurt, but he really enjoys it and keeps playing her game, subjecting himself to the most embarrassing and hilarious conditions imaginable. Just hearing Sadokuro complain about his pain is funny. At the same time, he begins dating a co-worker at a bookstore, which is more traditional and boring. Hence, Sadokuro can't stop thinking about Mayama.

""Electric Button,"" also known and ""Moon and Cherry,"" was quite a pleasant surprise, and a triumph for first-time director Yuki Tanada, who was also the writer. There is plenty sex and hilarious dialogue to keep you happy - trust me. (Japan, 2004, color, 82 min)
