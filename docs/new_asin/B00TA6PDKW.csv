8701071,5,B00TA6PDKW,"I purchased this movie because I remember my dad was very touched by this movie. That was in the mid eighties. I saw my father cried the first time. I am not very good with Chinese, but I think the Chinese title of the movie is 'Ride Wrong Car"", my literal translation. The movie is a sad one with a moral tale. The best ride the main female character had ever gotten is when she was adopted by a man who can't speak because of the injury  he acquired during what looked like Nationalist Chinese fighting with the Japanese war around WWII. Back then neighbors were like close family, and the main characters in the movie grew up in a poor part of Taiwan. The little girl grew up and became a singer, and she took the wrong ride to fame and fortune. Instead of helping her adopted father and neighbors, the world of carnality took her to a life of misery and separated her from the father that loved her. In the end the last time she saw her father was at his death bed. This movie is not a warm fuzzy feel good movie. Different folks sees different things out of this movie, as for me after watching this movie, I only want my children to pursue a godly life and not let the world mold them. Especially, I want them to visit me and remember me.",1423958400,6,1244,4.205020920502092
