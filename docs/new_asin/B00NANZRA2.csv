6619374,5,B00NANZRA2,This was just what I needed to start my greenhouse project.  I was worried about the expense and logistics of a concrete foundation. Now I know that I can do it with tires.  I especially like the voice that narrates the DVD.  Very well spoken.,1431388800,,243,4.355555555555555

8676811,3,B00NANZRA2,"The DVD is done in more of a documentary style rather than a how-to style, they show a before and during shots but no after shots. The film just seems to abruptly end with a lot of dead space. Some sequences of construction are even out of order. A rather poorly done film.
The ebook and plans are on the DVD, something not mentioned in the description. I had expected to get the plans on paper in the case and maybe a code of some sort to get the ebook online, nope.
Is it worth $20? In my opinion, no. Maybe worth $10. This is old school technology using a DVD-ROM, I didn't even know people still used those. Even Tumbleweed Tiny Homes when they sell their book and plans online it's in a download, and they are technically a older company/group!!! Good information, helpful, but poor use of resources for getting the information out. My advice: save your money, wait for a sale.",1518739200,,882,4.384146341463414
8676812,2,B00NANZRA2,"I received the DVD no problem. I did not get the plans or the  e-book. Those are more important than the DVD. If anyone who bought this package before knows how to get these please let me know! I would love to build this greenhouse!

Thank you!!",1510272000,,245,4.191489361702128
8676813,1,B00NANZRA2,"This is a great Idea, However it is far to complicated a design. If he would consider a much simpler design then more folks would build it.  I mean getting all those use tires.  Holy molly.  Why not construct a simpler base?",1484092800,,224,4.285714285714286

8676818,3,B00NANZRA2,I thought I had ordered it with information on Aquaponics but nothing about Aquaponics. My fault probably because the search brought it up when looking for good aquaponics video material.  Very well done - very detailed and somewhat boring due to so much detail but good job.,1464134400,2,275,4.851063829787234
