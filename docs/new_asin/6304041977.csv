766422,5,6304041977,"I was browsing a store in London one day on a study abroad I did last year. I was bored when I saw this video it captured my attention. I bought it and took it home to watch with my friend.  We couldn't stop talking,  sighing, and laughing throughout the whole movie. It was so good that we  watched it twice. The main actress and maniel the sexy and charming  stableboy flit from scene to scene sparing with wit and experience the  dangers to be found in the real world away from fancy dresses, balls, and  country estates. This is deffinately a winner. Why haven't I heard of it  before? I'm surprised it was so excellently done, and yet I have never  known it existed before I bought it.",952646400,4,690,4.294573643410852
766423,5,6304041977,"- I am a big fan of Catherine Cookson's work, but the Glass Virgin is by far my favorite one. It has it all: adventure, romance, its sweet at times and thrilling at others. I agree with the other reveiwers, it was well  acted and the costumes were wonderful.",945993600,4,258,4.26530612244898

Glass Virgin is about a young heiress who discovers that she is the daughter of her father's mistress. After this secret is revealed; she runs away with the groom, a man named Mendoza and takes up a life in service.

This movie was okay, but I felt it wasn't as good as other films of Cookson's books. The actor who played Mendoza seemed a wee bit too old, and unfit to be the dashing hero he was portrayed as being. I also felt the heroine could've handled her situation a trifle better, as she was too quick to believe what others tell her (such as her mother abandoning her to her fate, etc), and too quick to give up her life, to run away.

I prefer heroines who use their brains to help themselves and the heroine of Glass Virgin was often portrayed as a victim. The ending seemed a bit rough and I felt sorry for the mother. I wish it had ended differently.

3 stars. Not my favorite.",1218067200,,926,4.304597701149425
7859877,5,6304041977,"I saw this movie several years ago on tv and came across it here and purchased it.  The acting is excellent and the story line holds the interest of the viewer. Each character comes across

wonderfully and the movie holds the viewer intent until  the end.

The one thing that truly comes across is what real love and

devotion is. I am glad I added this to our movie collection and

would highly recommend this to anyone!",1097712000,11,421,4.402597402597403
7859878,5,6304041977,I consider this to be the best of Cathrine Cookson's stories. I found the wardrobe and settings to be true to the period We found those added to the plus features of the sotry. The actors were very good and no one can be wanting for a good story line to watch. We have most all the other movies made from her collection of fine writings. This one we have watched twice since receiving it only a few days ago. A sequeal to this movie would be well received.,970790400,10,456,4.134831460674158
7859879,5,6304041977,I enjoyed every minute of this video.  It had plenty of action without silly consequences for the characters decisions.  I felt as if I was part of the story and the time flew by.  I would have liked to see more.  Any chance of a sequel to see how Mauel did with the glass factory?,969408000,3,281,4.054545454545455
7859880,5,6304041977,"Just as a another reviewer stated, I happened to chance upon this movie without even having heard of it before.  And, I'll admit that at the time I was unfamiliar with Catherine Cookson. This is by far one of her most  romantic book-turned-movies (The Glass Virgin novel is great too!) and was  glad that I had the rare opportunity to catch it (while on vacation!) on  the Romance Classics cable channel.  The characters, costumes, scenery,  plot, the whole story line is one to cherish over and over again with a  loved one or even by yourself on a rainy day.  Do not pass this movie (or  book) by, I guarantee you will enjoy it!",964742400,8,630,4.456140350877193
