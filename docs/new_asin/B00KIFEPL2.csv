8659235,5,B00KIFEPL2,"Skip Jennings is a longtime fitness professional who has been an active participant in the field of Exercise and Training. As a retired group fitness instructor myself, I recognize him as a trainer, presenter, demonstrator and as a background exerciser on various fitness videos.  This is a very good video, executed with good sequencing and choreography that delivers what it promises. My personal experience with this video is, (although I am fit) I am well into my 60's, the pacing is somewhat fast for me, so I take it slowly with breaks, but I am sure this is an excellent video for a younger body that can keep up with the flow of the movement. The work, and the principles behind it, is sound and builds in an orderly way, resulting in the greater strength and flexibility that comes with a dancer's body. That being said, this video may not be exactly suitable for a brand newcomer since there is not a lot of explanation of the moves and poses. However, a beginner/intermediate to advanced level exerciser may enjoy the challenge and the cumulative benefits that come with practice.",1410307200,5,1091,4.772486772486772
