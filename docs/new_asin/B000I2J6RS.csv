2651228,5,B000I2J6RS,"My mom has told me all her life about seeing the movie ""Perri"" when she was a little kid and how much that movie just blew her mind because it was a full length movie in color about nature.  It was nice to finally be able to share Perri with her, and any kids (and adults) who love nature and animals will instantly connect with Perri the squirrel and her crazy adventures.  I didn't get to see any of the rest of the disc, but getting to share that movie with my mom and watch her face as she watched it was worth every penny.  My mom assures me that the rest of the collection is a blast.",1206489600,20,590,3.983050847457627
2651229,5,B000I2J6RS,"Disney is magical.  They capture the greatest shots, the narration has that certain sound we all remember when we were little kids watching it on tv.  This is such a great dvd to add to your library.  The pictures and colors are so brilliant and vibrant!  Both dvd's are special.  What a treat it is to have.",1197158400,4,308,4.333333333333333
2651230,5,B000I2J6RS,This is classic Disney. Makes me think of when I was young and watched these with my family. These are perfect for all families even decades later. I still enjoy watching all of these classics.,1192060800,4,193,4.542857142857143
2651231,5,B000I2J6RS,"Could you rate it a 10 or 100. Who couldn't love Disney's True Adventures. Yes, there is even a whole channel for animal adventures now, but they were the first--and they were the best. They are pack in a great package; durable and imaginative. The added interviews and backstage scenes are great. I can remember seeing them on their program (in black and white) when I was in first grade. They are wonderful. It was a treat to learn about the couple who filmed them too. Spending years and years filming things they thought was funny or interesting. Then bringing them back and someone putting them together into a story that is loved forever. I have all four of them. And we watch them over and over.",1187913600,4,702,4.535433070866142
2651232,3,B000I2J6RS,"The material on these DVDs would get 5 stars, but I've given it 3 because of some mistakes by Disney.

To start off I want to warn everyone that there appears to have been a mistake during the production of this DVD. The last reel of 'Secrets of Life' was originally in cinemascope and some copies of this title indeed do show this in cinemascope with a message at the beginning of the movie forewarning the viewer that the film will change to widescreen near the end of the film. However some copies of this title do not have this  and the footage is pan and scan. So it will probably be luck of the draw as to which one you get! Hopefully Disney will offer a disc replacement program for all of those unhappy people!

Aside from that issue this is a wonderful collection of Disney True Life Adventures. The 2 features are wonderful 'Secrets of Life' really is stunning in every way and 'Perri' being a true life fantasy based upon the novel by Felix Salten (who wrote Bambi) has a much more of a Disney film feel to it than the slighty more educational nature of the True Life Adventures.

Since the contents are already listed above I won't bother listing them again let me just say these films are truly entertaining and wonderful in every way and the bonus features are so in depth and so informative it's untrue!

One negative (aside from the fact that some people will get an incorrectly framed version of 'Secrets of Life') is that the Disneyland show 'Adventure in Wildwood Heart' is presented in black and white, yet when it is being discussed in the bonus features the clips are in color! If color footage of it survives, why was this not provided instead of the black and white version? Disney make stupid decisions!",1167868800,34,1728,4.490445859872612
2651233,5,B000I2J6RS,"I know of this film only through a richly illustrated book for children, Secrets of Life, with photographs from the film by the Disney Studio. I borrowed the book several times from the library simply for its wonderful photographs of the life of bees. One sequence struck me-how bees do a 'dance' to 'tell' other bees in the hive where a good source of nectar(a field of flowers) is. According to Roy Disney the film looks better than it did when originally released. According to other reviewers the movie includes lovely time lapse photography of flowers accompanied by the classical piece, Bolero. Nature lovers, rejoice! This set also includes Perri, the life of a squirrel, which was also well received.",1164672000,22,708,4.908333333333333
2651264,5,B000I2J6RS,I saw this when it first came out in 1956 and have remembered it my whole life.  It  was so fascinating I went on to a college major of cellular biology then  medical school.  Very influential and great for children.,1325289600,,216,4.325
2651265,5,B000I2J6RS,"Excellent, takes me back to the 60s when I was a kid. These were shown in the movie theater. Well worth the cost to get them.",1320624000,,125,3.8461538461538463
2651266,5,B000I2J6RS,"The reason TLA Vol 1 and Vol 4 are out of print is because they both had issues and require replacement disks to fix the issues.  Prowlers of the Everglades had two of the color channels reversed and Secrets of Life is supposed to transition to widescreen for the final reel. I'm guessing Disney must have pulled them from stores and discontinued them. I think it is unfair to charge exorbitant prices for a defective disk that requires replacement.  Hopefully they will eventually be released on Blu-ray someday.  If you've seen the restored Grand Canyon on the Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray, you'll know the improvement would be well worth the effort.",1318550400,6,647,4.863636363636363

2651268,5,B000I2J6RS,"These DVD sets were a long time in coming, but finally, Disney released the entire collection in 2006 under the new and all too short-lived Walt Disney Legacy Collection banner. All the cherished True-Life Adventures, the 1950's (well, '48 through '60) film series that inspired the classic Jungle Cruise theme park ride, Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park, and the new Disneynature film series, as well as all nature and wildlife documentaries that followed these classics, are presented here in four volumes, each a 2-disc DVD set that the legendary Walt Disney Treasures Collection would be proud of (and at times, perhaps even envious of). Each set is housed in a lovely window case with the discs held inside a small film canister with beautiful artwork printed on top. Some may complain about the cardboard disc placements, but they do their job, and at least it's easy to remove and return the discs to them. Also included is a standard contents insert and a ""Passport"" world map card highlighting the locations where filming was done, as well as some of the animal stars. But, enough about the attractive packaging. On to the contents of the Walt Disney Legacy Collection, Volume 4: Nature's Mysteries!

Contrary to the impression you might get from the art on the tin canister that houses the two discs in volume 4, this is not an undersea themed collection. In fact, if anything, I see this as a ""little creatures"" collection (think birds, squirrels, fish, plants, and lots of insects), volcanoes not withstanding. There are two True-Life Adventure feature films (though neither quite reaches 80 minutes) on disc one, and among many Bonus Features on disc two, there is a True-Life Adventures featurette (just over half an hour). As Leonard Maltin was the jovial host of the Walt Disney Treasures Collection DVD line (which was so very similar to this one), Walt's nephew, the late Roy E. Disney, serves as the host for the Walt Disney Legacy Collection. He provides intros and interviews with a similarly pleasant demeanor, and with his resemblance to his uncle and personal experience working on the True Life Adventures, is a welcome inclusion in the line.

The first film on Disc 1 is ""Secrets of Life"". This 1956 documentary is probably among the better remembered True Life Adventure subjects with its unforgettable footage of bees and ants, and the big volcano eruption finale that is presented in Cinemascope, unlike the preceding bulk of the film.

The second film on Disc 1 is 1957's ""Perri"", the first and only True-Life Adventure billed as a True-Life Fantasy since it was cut and at times choreographed to be loosely based on the book ""Perri"" by ""Bambi"" author Felix Salten. The story runs similar to that of Bambi, only the star here is a female squirrel named Perri. In fact, Bambi even makes a live-action cameo, which is quite a treat for Disney geeks like myself. The Oscar nominated score is wonderful and there are even some Bambi-like songs. Of course, this still feels a lot like any other Disney True-Life Adventure since it is real animal footage with full Winston Hibler narration.

These two features take up disc one, only sharing space with a Disney's Animal Kingdom promo and an Introduction from Roy Disney to the contents of this volume. That is in addition to the intro to the Legacy Collection line, which starts automatically when the disc is put in and actually talks of a 5th and 6th volume that were never released. The Walt Disney Legacy Collection was ended prematurely, either because of the outcry from fans who thought it was replacing the Disney Treasures line or due to a lack of sufficient profit to satiate the Disney suits (not that they ever advertise this sort of stuff well enough to expect much). As a result, the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit volume had to be transformed into a Disney Treasures release and the Destino volume was canceled all together (the short was only recently released as a bonus on the new Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 Blu-Ray). Thank goodness this 4th volume completed the True-Life Adventures releases, as even the Walt Disney Treasures Collection has since gone the way of the dodo.

Now, before discussing Disc Two, I'd like to mention a word about Disc One's reported flaw. Yes, some of us, myself included, were unfortunate enough to receive versions of Disc One in which the final sequence of ""Secrets of Life"" was not presented in Cinemascope. A replacement disc was indeed offered. Contact Walt Disney Home Entertainment, as they probably are still able to send you a replacement if your copy doesn't go to widescreen towards the end of that particular program. I'm afraid I don't have the number handy, but if you putt around Disney.com or ask on a Disney forum, or probably if you just do a search or go through the other reviews here, you're sure to find the phone number. In fact, I know they had to offer a replacement for at least one other True Life Adventures disc as well, but I forget which at the moment. When I review it, I'll mention it there too (I oddly seem to be reviewing these in reverse, but that's okay, because as others have pointed out, Volume 4 is actually an excellent introduction to the series).

Now, on to Disc 2, which is basically regarded as the Bonus Features disc, even though the first program, ""Nature's Half Acre"", should hardly be called a Bonus Feature. It is a true entry into the True-Life Adventure line, and it's even an Oscar Winner for best short subject. This 1951 featurette themes itself as a look at a half acre that could be anywhere; again, focusing on the little creatures and interesting plants that coexist in such an area. Birds, bugs, and such things, it's sort of like a close-up look at the jungle in one's own backyard.

Disc Two also includes two of my favorite kind of extra, complete episodes of the Disney anthology TV show! These always make me happy (even if what I really want are the ones with original animation in them). Here, we get two very relevant episodes. From 1956, ""Searching for Nature's Mysteries"" is basically a making-of/promotional program for Secrets of Life. It heavily features True-Life Adventure narrator Winston Hibler and takes a look at the new technology developed for creating the film. The second program is from 1957 and titled ""Adventures in Wildwood Heart"". Wildwood Heart is the setting for Disney's ""Perri"", and the film is again a making-of/promotional episode that, after a brief look back at Disney animal history, focuses on the efforts of the filmmakers to shoot in Wildwood Heart and the experiences they had there, like sharing breakfast with animals and helping to put out a real forest fire.

The more typical Bonus Features follow on Disc 2 with featurettes like ""Backstage with Roy Disney at Disney's Animal Kingdom: Butterflies"", in which a bit of Animal Kingdom promotion is mixed with a lesson on the title creatures from Cast Members at the Rafiki's Planet Watch (a section of the wonderful Florida theme park), and ""Tribute to Winston Hibler"", in which family of the late Disney True-Life Adventures writer, producer, and narrator discuss his legendary work on the projects. Truly, Winston was an unforgettable part of Disney history, and along with the wonderful music and lighthearted, fanciful tone of the films, his voice and prose definitely were key to setting Disney's True-Life Adventures apart from the typical, rather boring pre-Animal Planet nature documentaries. In fact, some folks who find Animal Planet boring still love the Disney True-Life Adventures.

Further Disc 2 Bonus features actually include theatrical trailers for Secrets of Life AND Perri, which are a real treat to see, as well as the ""Filmmaker's Journal"", which is an excellent behind the scenes retrospective featurette. A fave of mine though, is ""Collector's Corner"", in which a Disney historian actually presents and talks about merchandise produced to promote the True Life Adventures featured in this volume. As an avid Disney collector myself, a featurette like this is never long or common enough. I could watch a whole DVD on Disney collectibles if it focused on classic live-action or just generally less discussed subject matter like the True-Life Adventures! These days, I wouldn't have thought that I could go on Ebay and pick up a nice bit of ""Perri"" memorabilia, or even a Secrets of Life book or Nature's Half Acre comic! Who would have thought animal documentaries were promoted with stuffed toys, record albums, and comics? I'll definitely be looking for some of that stuff eventually, and I really wish all Disney DVDs of pre-90's material had a featurette like this. It certainly provides some nice suggestions on what to keep an eye out for.

Anyway, that sums up Volume 4 of Walt Disney's Legacy Collection: True-Life Adventures - Nature's Mysteries, a fantastic two disc set. I have owned all four of the Disney Legacy Collection sets since they were released, and yet I'm barely getting around to watching and reviewing them, but after this one, I can't wait to check out the other three. If you're a lover of Disney or animal/nature programs, you'll wanna give these a shot, even if you just love one or the other. The Disney style makes them tolerable to even the most uninterested science student, and if you're not generally a Disney person, well, not all Disney is talking doorknobs and frying pan's in a duck's face. This is solid entertainment that manages to be educational too, but in a fun way. The presentation here is excellent, and if you grew up with these films, you'll definitely want to seek out all four volumes. And if you want more Disney animal material, there were plenty of more story-style ones that can now be found on DVD, like Yellowstone Cubs, Lobo, Charlie the Lonesome Cougar, etc..., but there are all new documentaries too, like the films coming from Disneynature, which may have run their limit now, as I'm not sure if anyone has been going to see them, sadly. And if you're just looking for more serious Disney fanatic geared releases now that the Disney Treasures and Disney Legacy lines are over and done with, be aware that Disney did release some new documentary material just recently, only in simple, single disc DVD releases. Look up the DVD ""Walt and El Grupo"" to see what I mean. I'll be picking that one up ASAP. Also on my list and new this year are ""Waking Sleeping Beauty"" and ""The Boys: The Sherman Brothers' Story"". Happy viewing!",1295654400,7,10480,4.872686483454851
2651269,5,B000I2J6RS,Educational entertainment of the best kind for the whole family and in fact for everyone. Volume 4 was a bit costly and harder to find but worth every dollar I spent to complete the four volume set of outdoor adventures that are like no others.

8143280,5,B000I2J6RS,"This DVD collection contained the film called Perry, which my boyfriend has always wanted to have a copy of.  It's a delightful piece of historical Disney memorabilia and we throughly enjoyed the extras included in the set (i.e. the extraordinary film techniques that were developed to film these animals out in the wild).  Amazing!

No problems with the vendor (""DISNEY VAULT"", from Las Vegas, Nevada) and the price was reasonable for an out of print ""oldie"". I received the DVD in pristine condition (factory-sealed, as advertised) from the USA.  I would definitely order more products from this vendor!  Thank you !",1519084800,,618,5.079207920792079

The bonus features add greater depth and fill in a lot of information I always wondered about.  I loved seeing the Wonderful World of Disney again.  It was always on Sunday nights when we normally were at church.  We only saw it when we got back late from a family get-together or there was a big snow storm.
