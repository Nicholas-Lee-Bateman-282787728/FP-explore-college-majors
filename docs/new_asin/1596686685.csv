7799770,4,1596686685,"I found this DVD to be VERY basic.  If you have never done any dyeing and never watched any dyeing videos (including those on youtube), this DVD is perfect.  If you have even a bit of experience, it may be too basic.  The one element that was new to me was the color blending portion.  I have watched that section repeatedly, but it was very brief.",1413158400,3,348,4.2272727272727275
7799771,5,1596686685,"I watched this and haven't used the process yet.  The instructions are clear and I know I'd have to go back, watch again, take notes on amounts, etc. before I do any of this.",1394496000,2,174,4.117647058823529
7799772,5,1596686685,Great DVD that would recommend to any or everyone dyeing protein fibers! I saw it at a training class and had to have it for my home.,1380672000,,133,3.962962962962963
7799773,5,1596686685,"This was a great ""refresher"" course for me in dyeing protein fibers.  Everything is right there on the DVD, all pulled together into categories and most helpful.  Glad I bought it and will probably review it the next time I go on a marathon dyeing spree to make sure I haven't forgotten anything.",1349136000,5,296,4.566037735849057
