3561096,5,B001F114J4,A stark contrast to too much of what is out there.  I find that the use of gutter language is a sure indicator that the writers and directors of a movie realized that their film was a dog- so they add langauge that shocks to cover this up. AThis film is a welcome contrast.,1207267200,20,273,4.055555555555555

3561121,5,B001F114J4,This is a lovely little movie.  It's family friendly for the most part and it's just a wonderful romance with some funny parts.  Doesn't hurt that the main male actor is quite handsome. ;),1397520000,,188,4.5
3561122,5,B001F114J4,This is a good moral movie that the whole family can watch together. I would recommend this movie to you as well.,1397260800,,113,4.181818181818182

I e-mailed the company, and I simply repackaged the faulty DVD, and a UPS driver came 2 days later, and picked up the package. within a week, I had another, DVD, at no cost to me. The DVD works perfectly, and I had absolutely no trouble returning the faulty DVD, Thank you for such great customer service!  Theresa  Greenwald",1368921600,,468,4.247191011235955
3561133,5,B001F114J4,"Nice little innocent romance movie with two of my favorite actors. As frequent visitors to Alaska, that may have led to the appeal for us. Reminded us of Ketchikan. Dozens of float planes are taking off and you can watch from one of the many restaurants along the water. The story was fun, and the scenery unmatched. Think you'll enjoy this one, and probably book a cruise soon after (lol).",1366329600,,390,4.585714285714285
3561134,4,B001F114J4,"This is family friendly story.  We enjoyed seeing a movie where the family pulls together to renew their love and restore their marriag.  The acting was average to good by the children.  Adult acting was good. The husband/father is definitately ""eye candy"".",1364169600,,257,5.071428571428571

3561137,5,B001F114J4,"I'd already seen this movie and wanted it as a keeper, so I ordered it.  In my opinion, any family would make this a movie for family night.",1361145600,,140,4.0

3561142,5,B001F114J4,"Wilderness Love is a charming, light romance movie with a number of good twists to the plot.  Absolutely none of the Hollywood promotion of deviant lifestyles, or coarse humor.  Plot line deals with divorce, but affirms strong loving marriages.  Good family entertainment for preteen and older children.  My wife and I have both enjoyed watching this many times.",1316995200,,362,5.189655172413793
3561143,5,B001F114J4,Finally a story of a marriage gone bad that ends happily back on track!  The kids and their antics and the reactions of their parents are hilarious.  It is refreshing to view a movie that is 99% devoid of innapropriate language. Although the movie really wasn't filmed in AK except for those few city scenes from Anchorage it still deals with typical AK fly-in fishing camps and the scenery is beautiful.  The parents reaction to their adolescent child is acted well and funny.,1310947200,,477,4.72289156626506
3561144,5,B001F114J4,"Really enjoy this movie. Love Valerie & her co~star is so handsome !

3561145,2,B001F114J4,"A very poor movie. It's slow moving and has a dull plot. Much of the film could
have been edited out.
  There's really nothing worth seeing in it.  I shut off my VCR after about
30 minutes,
  Not a film to buy.",1285027200,,210,3.9047619047619047

3561150,5,B001F114J4,"I had a hard time finding this movie because when they show it on tv, it's called Personally Yours. I don't know why the change titles. It's annoying. But that's the only annoying thing about this movie. Also...why do they discontinue and redesign the package?
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! It's absolutely adorable...and cheesy. But I think the chemistry between Valerie Bertinelli and Jeffrey Nordling is fantastic! I still get the geeky giggles whenever I watch them tiptoe around their true feelings for each other.
The bed scene didn't bother me. It's not like they were full on naked when the kids walked in. The kids were only laughing because they were happy to see their relentless scheming may have actually payed off.",1251590400,,718,4.89344262295082
3561151,2,B001F114J4,"I hadn't seen this movie, but I bought it on the strength of repeated reviews calling it a good family movie. I've learned my lesson. Call me old-fashioned, but when a couple that has been divorced for two years ends up in bed together, that isn't my idea of family values, even if when their children discover them they all get a good laugh out of it. The mother's advice to her barely 16-yr. old daughter about sex left a lot to be desired, too. Basically she gives her daughter a green light as long as she thinks she is in love first. It could have been a nice family show, and if the things I've mentioned don't bother you, then you may enjoy it. Performances are good and the story line is interesting, though a bit confusing at first. But if you are a ""prude"" like me, steer clear.",1246752000,22,788,4.26
3561152,4,B001F114J4,"Our family loves this show - nothing inappropriate or vulgar.  Entertaining and light, yet hopeful about the triumph of true love and marriage.",1246060800,,143,5.217391304347826
3561153,4,B001F114J4,"Jeffrey Nordling did such a great job as FBI Agent Larry Moss on Day 7 of the tv show 24 that I wanted to see more of his work and ordered this movie off Amazon.  I really enjoyed it.  I don't usually like ""cutesy"" movies but the chemistry between Jeffrey and Valarie Bertinelli was great and the kids were good.  It had a lot of humor and the storyline was really good.  I recommend this for anyone who is in the mood for a nice romance with a sexy leading man who has more depth then just some pretty boy.",1242864000,6,507,4.04

3561155,5,B001F114J4,This is one of my all time favorites out of all that I have collected.  It is a family movie to view.,1224633600,,101,3.590909090909091
