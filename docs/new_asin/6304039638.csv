7861114,3,6304039638,I guess I'm not a very sophisticated person  because I was confused throughout the film. It felt like there was something missing and I had a feeling of disconnection.  I was able to figure out the plot but it was hard work and I don't want to work that hard for entertainment.,1388275200,,277,4.3076923076923075
7861115,5,6304039638,"Mambety's Touki Bouki is an interesting merging of high-modernist style (Godard's Pierrot le Fou, Antonioni's Zabriskie Point, Roeg's Walkabout) and localist content. The first part of the film is set in rural Senegal on the outskirts of Dakar. The first images are of oxen being herded out in the country but then Mambety juxtaposes these pastoral images with graphic images of oxen being butchered in a slaughterhouse. We can tell these images hold great symbolic significance/value for Mambety and for Mory, his main character, who rides a motorcycle with an ox skull attached to the handlebars, but not until the end of the film do we fully understand just what the ox symbolizes. Before we are introduced to the characters, however, Mambety introduces us to their world which is a disorienting blend of traditional African ways and imagery with the sights and sounds of modernity (a Mobil oil sign, the sound of a jet over a rural marketplace). The most striking thing about this world is the ease with which these two worlds seem to get along but as the film progresses we see this ease is largely an illusion. Of the two main characters Anta is the more firmly grounded (she has a job and is a student at the local university) while Mory is more of a dreamer who seems to float through these competing realities on his motorcycle rather than inhabit either one. On one level this is a love story and on another it is a coming-of-age story albeit a coming-of-age story in a very specific geographic and political context. The film is a rare visual pleasure and the images of these two lovers/rebels against a backdrop of blue ocean and sun-drenched hilltops and skies are breathtakingly beautiful and New Wave cool. But the two are not content to live out their days in Senegal, what drives their passion for life and for each other is a shared dream of living in Paris (where they imagine they will avoid living like their fellow countrymen who they view as street sweepers and mailmen). To get to Paris they need money though and to get money they resort to a life (or at least one sun-drenched afternoon) of crime. The crimes are not violent, they are played more as comedy capers than as dangerous heists but with each crime there is a sense that their dream/youth/love and their identity (primarily Mory's) is beginning to disintegrate. Two songs are repeated over and over again---one full of hope ""Paris, Paris, Paris"" and one full of disappointmnet ""Love Lasts a Moment, Heartbreak Last a Lifetime."" Even without these two songs, we know the beauty and the cool will not last. And of course it doesn't. Before heading to their ship they ditch their motorbike which is immediately appropriated by a young wild man/hippie who lives in a tree (another wonderfully comic moment). The ending of this film is perhaps my all-time favorite ending of a film. At films end Anta is determined to pursue their (no longer) shared dream and she continues on to Paris alone but Mory at the last moment decides not to board the ship to Paris. It would seem he feels a greater connection to his homeland and its strangely divided indentity than he thought. He runs back to town only to find that the wild man/hippie has been wounded in a traffic accident. As he's being loaded into an mabulance he ask Mory who is holding the ox skull,""did you know it, it was a handsome beast?"" The film ends with another image of oxen being herded on the outskirts of the village to what we know will be their eventual slaughter. Throughout the film we realize that Mory identifies with the ox but it is only now that we with Mory realize the depth and significance of this tragic but also beautiful identification.",1384214400,,3697,4.70679012345679
7861116,4,6304039638,"A next story of potential migrants whose intentions wouldn't amuse at all as Senegal depicted testifies in this case.

A pare of pro-western-looking young people stole whatever to make it in Paris.

Well, if they drive own motor-bike and a car, no wonder they will nothing to do in a French semi-colony.

Humor and a natural actors' beauty add a very something to this work interesting for depicting a place so rarely screened wherever.",1316995200,,436,4.864864864864865
7861117,3,6304039638,"This film was okay. A weird movie, and it was sorta worth watching though I'm not sure why. Slow moving for American standards. Be patient if you're gonna watch it.",1285200000,,164,4.5
7861118,5,6304039638,"I love this film.  It is so very in your face yet subtle at the same time.  Its is fantastic story telling.  The animal killing scene are graphic (especially for a life long veg. like myself), but they work well with in the telling of the story.

Very good intro to senegalese film.",1174435200,,282,4.264150943396227

7861120,4,6304039638,"TOUKI BOUKI is an early film by the late director Djibril Diop Mambty (LITTLE GIRL WHO SOLD THE SUN). One might categorize the film along the lines of BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER, but from a distinctly African (or non-Western) perspective. The story involves a couple who go on an adventure in Dakar, Senegal, in an attempt to raise money to go to Paris, France.
For those who are not used to the style and pace of African films, TOUKI BOUKI might take some getting used to. While the film flows at a brisk pace (at least by African standards), it doesn't follow the conventional Hollywood narrative formula.
Like most African films, TOUKI BOUKI is more concerned with the community as a whole rather than the goals of its two ""protagonists."" Also, you won't see the quick cutting found in most Western films, particularly those involving crime or adventure.
However, if you can get past the difference of TOUKI BOUKI compared to Hollywood films, there is much to savor here. It is a different kind of ride, but well worth it.",1013644800,11,1029,4.65934065934066
