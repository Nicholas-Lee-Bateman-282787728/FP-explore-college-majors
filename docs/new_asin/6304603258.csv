This particular one I would rent from the video store and I'm so glad to have found it after all these years!",1487808000,,318,4.482758620689655

7874551,5,6304603258,"Stegz receives a signal from intelligent dinosaurs in another dimension, leading the Extreme Dinosaurs to the desert for rendezvous with some extra-dimensional cousins. It turns out to be a set-up by the Raptors, who ambush the Extreme Dinosaurs and set out to burn a hole through the Earth's surface, releasing the heat of the molten interior. But the Extreme Dinosaurs have an unexpected ace in the hole: a freak accident has temporarily given Bullzeye the power to create any object he wants from thin air!",1163289600,,509,5.0
7874552,5,6304603258,"When top scientist Carl Wiseman announces that a gigantic asteroid hurtling towards Earth will miss completely, Stegz is suspicious - his calculations say it's going to sideswipe the Earth, causing terrible damage!  The Dinosaurs are right to be suspicious: the Raptors forced Wiseman to lie and then kidnapped him to keep him from warning anyone.  They think the asteroid impact will push the Earth closer to the sun, making it a lot warmer.....too warm for humans, but just right for Raptors!  The Extreme Dinosaurs must rescue Wiseman from the Raptors, and find a way to stop the asteroid before it's too late.",1163289600,,613,4.990196078431373

As said in the title, the only half human/half animal mutant show that tops it is Street Sharks! This one comes in close second place! This is the first one and their origin. An evil alien named Argor comes along to Earth 65 million years ago. He decides to make new minions for himself. He beams a T-Rex, a Triceratops, a Stegosaurus and a Pteranodon aboard. He gives them human intelligence and amazing power, and turns them into Spike, T-Bone, Bullzeye and Stegz(all 4 are super-cool, don't get me wrong, but that's the order I'd rank them in)Anyway, they reject Argor's plan to work for evil and are dumped. They survive, while Argor beams aboard 3 vicious velociraptors. He turns them, too, into mutants, and names them Bad Rap, Spitter and Haxxx(once more, all of them rock, but I'd rank them in that order)They are happy to do his evil work and are given weapons that rank up there with what Predator and Jason Voorhees use, even though not the same things. The dinosaur hero team meets a woman from space named Chedara, who they explain all that's going on to. The raptors show up and a fight ensues, Bad Rap ending it by using his potent weapon to destroy the Earth. The dinosaurs, the alien people and the raptors barely escape to a ship where they are put to rest until 65 million years later, the present day.(They do, however, look and function just as young and healthy as they were before)More fights ensue, and the dinosaurs discover humans, one of which captures them. But they escape and find out where they are and don't know what to do. But they have bigger things to worry about when the the raptors start to terrorize the city in an attempt to get the prehistoric tropic lands back. The dinosaurs fight them repeated times throughtout the episode, and then at the end defeat them. T-Bone knows that the bad raptors are still out there, though, and pose a threat. The four dinosaurs decide they will protect present day Earth from the raptors and any other evil. They dub themselves ""The Extreme Dinosaurs"" and that's the beginning of a great series that only Street Sharks tops, as said twice. If you like funny action shows with animal mutants, then I suggest you buy this.",1135987200,,2361,4.557647058823529
7874554,5,6304603258,"The Extreme Dinosaurs are a big influence and inspiration to me.  Even when they're on vacation, the action, adventure and excitement doesn't stop. Spike really made me laugh after scarfing down all those hot, spice chili peppers, then had to cool his mouth off in a watering hole.  T-Bone is my favorite, since he's always ready for ""carnivating time.""",979689600,,353,4.966101694915254
