8158790,5,B000KRK8WS,"I got this DVD to use for our 20 minute worship segment as part of Kids Church.  The tunes on this DVD have the kids out of their seats, singing and shouting.  Graphics are sharp, songs are up to date and the on screen lyrics make it easy for kids to follow along.  Take time to each the hand movements and songs and soon you will have all your kids wanting to lead worship.  Thanks Group!",1197763200,,389,4.078947368421052
