6440365,2,B00KQ82FXG,"I thought i would like this movie. I usually like coming of age stories or those about growing up. I sat through this movie for this reason hoping it would turn up something original, and besides, I love Star Wars. Nope. Didn't happen. There was something else that bothered me as well. The director or writer decided it was okay to use the words ""Wyatt's Rainbow Coalition of henchmen"" to describe Wyatt Swooker's idiotic and clumsy sidekicks; one of these young men is a Latino and the other black. The movie was cheesy and cutesy, and while I understand this as fine in a family movie, I cannot forgive the tasteless decision to use such borderline, racist posturing. I'm sure the writer or director figured this slight, or microaggression would go unnoticed by most. Aside this, the movie --which I'm sure hit its demographic target, did not hit any other target unless that target was labeled 'Trite.'",1409529600,,906,4.777070063694268

6440367,5,B00KQ82FXG,This is one of those movies that every family should watch together. It bridges the gaps between all ages and really makes you feel like you can identify with every one of the incredibly well written characters. An allstar cast and a script that blends all their talents into a masterpiece.,1408492800,3,290,4.705882352941177
6440368,5,B00KQ82FXG,"This was a great coming-of-age movie that brought back some fun memories of my own. I loved seeing the characters as they were and as they become and learning and growing with them. The actors did a great job at portraying their characters and really bringing the movie to life. This was a movie that really cam be shared with the whole family and is one that I thoroughly enjoyed!

8660755,5,B00KQ82FXG,"This film is so much better than you think it might be.  There is a sweet charm to the proceedings. The adolescent cast is top notch and clearly enjoying themselves throughout.  It takes place in the 80's and feels like an 80's movie, with a great 80's soundtrack to boot. Yeah, it's a family-friendly film but it's appeal goes beyond that.  It's the kind of movie you wish they made more of these days:  lots of charm and not that smart alecky cynicism that's so prevalent these days.",1449705600,,485,4.4772727272727275

8660759,4,B00KQ82FXG,"When this first begun I was sort of expecting Joe Cocker to start singing ""What would you do if I sang out of tune, would you stand up and walk out on me....""  The Stream's style is a very strong homage to the Wonder Years with constant voiceovers from the grown up voice of the child character and the same sort of joke commentary after the child suggests something might happen such as ""it didn't"" and so forth.  The Wonder Years granted appeared on TV in the late 80's but this movie is set in the early 80's so I'm not sure why they went with that angle.  It's obviously deliberate as Rainn Wilson sound's pretty similar to Daniel Stern the adult Kevin Arnold.

This DVD is promoted in DVD magazines and by it's cover as being about Star Wars, and having another late 80's kids TV show child character actor who played A C Slater from Saved by the Bell in it.  When Mario Lopez finally opens a door near the end you think, that's right he's in this, ten seconds later he leaves the shot and only comes back for a 5 second scene to close the door.  That's pretty unethical marketing and the poor guy hasn't really been able to land a gig since that show ended so I'm sure would have been grateful (and available) for a bit more screen time than that.  Even Amazon lists as the main star Rainn Wilson who obviously isn't.  Star Wars wise the movie starts off with a capture the flag type Star Wars game, and the premise of the film is the main character wants to get a new plastic baseball bat that he imagines is his light saber which is why they go on a hike along the stream to get to the store, but the Star Wars theme pretty much drops off fast.

There are a few 80's toys and the kids sing ""I Love Rockn'Roll"" as they walk through a storm water drain (a very dangerous thing to be encouraging kids to do in real life, how many real life drownings occur when kids do this, my local council spends a heap of money every year trying to stop kids doing this?).  I think the film being that it's pretty much going to appeal to an audience who were kids in the 80's should have had more reminders of the 80's for the audience to relive starting with music.  Other than the clothing and the fact parents aren't so paranoid and overprotective like they are today and actually let the kids go off and explore or play, or be home on their own, this views like it could have been set today.

The movie isn't really original, the plot we've seen countless times before making it very predictable.  It's sort of like Stand by Me but isn't a coming of age story and instead of going to poke a dead body with a stick, the kids are going to a sports store.  The gang of kids cast is made up of girls and boys obviously to appeal to a wider audience, but that was pretty rare back then, kids who were aged eleven (boys) and twelve (girls) pretty much stuck with their own gender in those days. The bullies in this one are played by adult actors, since they don't get up to any adult situations in the film, why didn't they cast other kids to play those roles, would have made it more realistic.

There's some weak writing at times, the log scene the biggest, surely a better obstacle/life hazard could have been thought of than crossing a fallen log over a stream.  Kids did this all the time when I was a kid in the 80's, it wasn't anything to think about.  Also reaching out your hand to pull someone to safety (save their life) doesn't make sense when you're horizontal.  There's things like suddenly the kids have a torch when they are in the drain, why is the adult narrator wearing a suit if he's driving across American on a sunny day? Even if he didn't have any other clothes due to lost luggage or something we aren't told about, he'd at least take off the jacket.  Why can the dog not catch a human when both are running?

The film is made partly by various kids from Boys or Girls clubs.  I'm not entirely sure what that is, but I'm assuming they are some sort of disadvantage youth groups.  During the credits you see the various clubs holding the sound stick, and operating other equipment.  They seemed to do a decent  job of it, if you weren't told, you wouldn't have noticed with the end product.  The child actors as far as I'm aware haven't been in anything else but all do a pretty good job, they are obviously older than the kids they are playing though.  Although not as little time as Lopez, the other adult actors don't have a great amount of screen time either.  The main character's dad looked a bit young to be his father, sure our parents had kids younger back then but he must have fathered the kid when he was around ten or twelve years old.

I'd rate this three and a half stars, a movie to watch to be reminded of and have nostalgic feelings for this sort of movie from the 80's.",1420934400,,4801,4.251925192519252
8660760,4,B00KQ82FXG,"- Why I Watched This Film

I actually know the dog in the movie, Osko, and his trainer, Harry Ramos, who operates South Jersey K9 Solutions in the South Jersey/Philly area.

- Positives

This would be a good movie for kids. The plot is cute. Kelly Rutherford does a great job, and Rainn Wilson (Dwight Shrute from The Office) has a few appearances and performs the narration.

If you do not know, this movie was worked on heavily by groups of kids from Boys and Girls Clubs throughout New Jersey. And I believe the profits from the film benefit those groups.

I enjoyed watching the dog's scenes, because I know what goes into that sort of training, and it was fun to watch a dog I know on screen.

- Negatives?

Mario Lopez only makes a cameo appearance, if that is a deal breaker for you. The movie is more for kids than adults, though adults can enjoy it, too.

- Final Thoughts

Worth a watch with your kids. If you are interested in obtaining one of Osko's puppies, you should contact Harry Ramos. I know several of them, and they make excellent family protection dogs.",1420934400,,1074,4.438775510204081
