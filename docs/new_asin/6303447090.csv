677997,3,6303447090,"Mojovision is almost too silly for my taste.  I think the premise is interesting, but Mojo's character was too absurd to take seriously.  Anyway, Mojo is from another dimension and kidnaps the X-Men while they're  shopping for a new T.V. set because Jubilee destroyed the last one (if my  memory serves me correctly).  Mojo puts them in his TV show where the X-Men  have to try to stay alive in these simulations (episodes, if you will)  that he puts them in.  All hope seems lost as the different  simulations/episodes pick off the X-Men one by one...",968284800,4,552,4.666666666666667

7849878,3,6303447090,"The Dark Phoenix Saga is certainly the most famous X-Men story line and quite possibly the most highly regarded Marvel story arc ever.  In the original comic, written by Chris Claremont and penciled by John Byrne, Jean Grey, telepath and one of the original X-Men, is possessed by the spirit of the Phoenix and ultimately becomes one with this entity.  She gains unlimited power, but Lord Acton's comment that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, at first seems all too prophetic.  She loses touch with her humanity and causes massive destruction.  Ultimately, the ""real"" Jean allows herself to die because she chooses her humanity over her own God-like power.  (Sadly, Marvel later choose to bring back Jean Grey in one of the more unfortunate ""hero returns from the dead"" incidents.)

All of this is pretty heavy stuff and naturally it is toned down, substantially, in the animated series.  Jean Grey is resurrected immediately and the spirit of the Phoenix comes fairly close to an apology during a plea for understanding.  The horror of Jean's destruction while acting as the Dark Phoenix is also downplayed.  For the younger set (under 10?) this may be appropriate, but these revisions substantially undermine the power of the original story.  That is sad, because for the most part the animated series did an excellent job of capturing the ethos of the X-Men universe.

Bottom line:  this is a decent video for younger kids, but teens and adults would be better off with the original comic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-The-Dark-Phoenix-Saga/dp/0785122133/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga</a>.

This movie, however, is marred somewhat by tying the story line to the unrelated mutant cure story line.  So in the final analysis, as is so often the case, the original is the best.",1204329600,5,2175,5.687306501547988
7849879,5,6303447090,"This set includes two episodes entitled Captive Hearts & the other episode is Cold Vengence.
Captive Hearts takes places shortly after Wolverine is badly injured by sabertooth and the X-Men are on a mission to battle underground mutants that are called 'The Morlocks'. Storm battles their leader Callisto and encourage the Morlocks to return to the surface world when they become accepted by humanity. The episode ends with Wolverine not being present at the mansion and the ""To Be Continued"" line coming in.
The ""To Be Continued"" line ushers in the second episode in this set Cold Vengence. The story in this one is Wolverine takes a vacation in the Arctic when he is once again attacked by his archenemy Sabertooth. Wolverine retreats by means of an iceberg and is rescued by Inuit eskimos. Sabertooth blows up their village and has them captured and it's up to Wolverine to save the day.
A great episode combo from my all-time favorite cartoon series! Buy it!",1031961600,5,962,4.871951219512195
7849880,4,6303447090,"X-men are amazing, the second episode on this proves that point.  It is about Omega Red trying to reform the former USSR.  Colosus, comes to ask the X-men for help and he gets it.  A great fight seen results.  This episode doesn't have the best storyline, but it is still a good solid episode.  The first episode, ""Whatever It Takes"", is the reason this video didn't get five stars.  It isn't one of the better X-men videos.  The fight is interesting, but not amazing.  The storyline is poor.  It is about Storm and her history.  She almost perishes, and that gives this episode a little suspense.  The best part of this episode is though, seeing Morph again.  Wolverine conforts him.  Morph is still struggling though. Buy this video to find out what goes on with Morph.",1005955200,3,771,4.580882352941177
7849881,5,6303447090,"Mr. Sinister has to be one of the most interesting and mysterious evils ever to appear in the shows.  I enjoy the shows with Magneto as the bad guy more, because he is a classic, but these two episodes may be bestest only, in my mind, by the four beyond good and evil episodes.  The fight at the end is pretty good, but seeing Morph again is very amazing. Mr. Sinster and Morph raise so many questions in your head. Professor X, Cyclops, and Jean are absent for many of the events. Plus, Gambit and Storm are injured, so Wolverine really steps up.  No classic Wolverine fights, but this is one of his better stories.  This movie ends with a to be continued.  That really makes me mad.  I think I have seen what happens, but I forget what episode it is in and I really want to see it agian.  If you know what episodes that turns into, please e-mail me (...).  In conclusion, I found these episodes important to the X-men Storyline.  These are good for any X-men fan to own.",1003536000,,972,4.26775956284153

I really don't like it this way,I mean,how that heck will you be able to understand the story if it doesn't follow a correst order? It would be nice if they set up the serie by Volumes,I'm lost with all this serieses,how many are there anyway? This part of the story is quite good,I liked it but now,I don't know. I'd seen better things in my entire life but I just can't get enough of this serie,it's just so cool.",1001116800,,531,4.428571428571429
