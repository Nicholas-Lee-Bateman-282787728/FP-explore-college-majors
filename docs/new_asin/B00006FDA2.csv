1744959,4,B00006FDA2,"Gaudi Afternoom is what you could call an alternative piece of comedy . Set and filmed entirely in Spain , the movie is sharp , witty and full of dark humour . More of a film-noir if you'd like to categorize it , it's been carried  by a group of talented , underrated female actors . Davis is excellent in the lead role and so is Marcia Gay Harden ( in her most unusual part yet ) who is been provided with more than a couple of poisonous lines to work on by the script . The female versus...""female""  scenes are all great yet the best one of all is when Harden and Taylor try to convince a little girl that they can compromise with each other and get over their differences , all in return for her precious love . Certaintly not your ordinary hollywood comedy flick , this spicy film waits for you to discover .",1030233600,13,812,4.132911392405063

1744971,4,B00006FDA2,"I'm not sure of its genre, probably best labelled as a mystery. I bought it mostly for views of Barcelona, but it is a good, entertaining movie.",1400112000,,144,4.37037037037037
1744972,2,B00006FDA2,"but not Gaidi Afternoon. It is the kind of tedious movie that makes actor and audience alike wince. The script needs major tightening to develop a cohereant story line.

It is not enough to just rely on ""gender issues"" in hopes salacious interest will insure an audience no matter how badly produced. The audience and the topic deserve more. Susan Seidelman obviously never quite got her mo-jo on as competent direction appears to be sorely lacking. Lacking such direction, Judy Davis does a lot of  tiresome over-emoting. As it stands, this movie does Davis' career a disservice. Too bad.

There are some well-acted cameo/ bit parts which only serve as painful reminders of what ""good"" could have looked like. The screen play was by James Myhre adapted from a novel/mystery by Barbara Wilson. I was going to see about buying the book to see if the movie script had butchered the book but when I looked up the four books Wilson has written in this series the Amazon reviews in every case were so uneven,(unlikable characters and unlikely plots/resolutions) that I decided to just move on.",1382054400,,1088,4.838709677419355
1744973,3,B00006FDA2,"I enjoy this author's books very much, but was disappointed in the movie adaptation. Good cast but weak plot development.",1376524800,,121,5.1
1744974,1,B00006FDA2,"Since I'm a fan of Lili Taylor, I've been trying to see all of her movies.  When I read about ""A Gaudi Afternoon,"" I noted that the film had never gotten a distributor.  It's not too hard to see why.  The film is about a woman living in Spain who translates romance books to English who gets hired by a woman (who is supposed to be a man in drag but is played by a woman!) to find her ""husband"" Ben (played by Lili Taylor).  It's sort of a riff on a classic film noire plot, but in the end, it's just too weird and the acting is overdone to an unfunny and cringe-inducing degree.

The thing that truly disappointed me about this film is that Lili Taylor turns in a performance that she obviously cribbed from her portrayal of Valerie Solanis in ""I Show Andy Warhol"" (which is a far more coherent and better made film...although it glorifies someone who committed a senseless act of violence)...

Wait, I can't talk about this film in a pseudo-respectful tone.  It's a piece of garbage.  Taylor is a great actress and I've loved her work in a number of other films, but I'm glad I didn't see this film of her first, because I would have been so put off by her being associated with this film, I would have avoided watching any of her work like the plague.",1365984000,,1254,4.261603375527426
1744975,2,B00006FDA2,"I had no idea what was going on in this movie. I know for sure I wish they would have shown more views of Gaudi artwork and buildings. However, they failed at that and showing other parts of the fantastic city I heard of but never saw. Lot of yelling, in this hard to watch movie if you like fighting however.",1325289600,,309,4.081967213114754
1744976,4,B00006FDA2,"I'm not sure if Amazon wants me to review the film (we haven't watched it yet) or the purchase. The item was reasonably priced and arrived on time. It appears to be as described--new, in cellophane, and the title I wanted. That's all I can say for now.",1314144000,,252,4.270833333333333
1744977,4,B00006FDA2,"Gaudi Afternoon is a quirky comedy with some joyful acting performances, set amongst some of Gaudi's architectural masterpieces in Barcelona. The plot twists and turns, as, it seems, do the sexual preferences, as the film progresses.  Reminiscent of a comedic whodunnit, it's a where is he/she rather than a who killed him/her for the reluctant heroine.  Perfect for a light and entertaining rainy afternoon.",1202947200,,408,5.359375
1744978,2,B00006FDA2,"It's very interesting, in that the major roles, with one exception, are female.  Having a female play a sex-changed male is unusual too. I would have enjoyed knowing why the translator was alienated from her mother.  I did enjoy the movie. It was refreshing to have a mystery in which no one was in serious danger.",1201478400,,314,4.589285714285714
1744979,2,B00006FDA2,"Judy Davis is very good, but I lost interest in the story and the other characters about halfway through, but I did see the rest, thanks to Judy Davis. My wife and I both thought the whole thing was just so-so.  Saw it on TV, and have now erased it.",1188086400,,249,3.98
1744990,3,B00006FDA2,"I loved this movie.  I've always been a huge Judy Davis fan since I discovered her in David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.  The characters are almost as whimsical as the architecture.  The cinematography is one of the outstanding features on this film.  My question is whether this film is available in a widescreen format?  Having seen the film in it's original aspect ratio I was disappointed by this full frame release.  We miss so much of the movie that, even with the interesting plot and characters, it is ultimately frustrating and disappointing.",1159574400,5,548,4.967032967032967
1744991,4,B00006FDA2,"Though Barbara Wilson's novel by the same name casts the characters a bit differently than the film does, this cinematic exploration of gender and sexuality is really entertainting. When I try to explain it to my hip and theory-wise friends they roll their eyes at all of the plot twists, but they don't seem so hokey as you watch. And the opening credit sequence of this film is stunning--absolutely stunning. There are all of these gorgeous stained-glass-like images which fold and melt into one another; almost the way the identity of some of the characters evolves and shifts during the course of the film. We have the usual independent film suspects in the cast--notably Marcia Gay Harden and Lili Taylor--but oddly it doesn't just feel like yet another little indie film that could. The actors do a wonderful job of seducing us as much as each other, and Judy Davis' performance is much more nuanced than perhaps the film even asks for--which makes it especially delicious. And the landscape of Barcelona is truly fabulous. From the first frame to the last frame, you'll be entranced and engaged and surprised.",1080000000,13,1116,4.91005291005291
1744992,5,B00006FDA2,"Gaudi Afternoon is a gem, most notable for its beautiful cinematography. A truly colorful film, not to mention a very colorful script...and, of course, a colorful cast.
Judy Davis is wonderful, Marcia Gay Harden is dazzling, Lili Taylor is superb, and Juliette Lewis is irresistibly sweet!
Gaudi Afternoon's originality shines; a rare find that deserved a LOT more credit than it received. I'm definitely buying this one on DVD!!",1075680000,4,429,5.231884057971015
1744993,5,B00006FDA2,"Had read the book many years ago, had heard rumblings about making a movie based on the book and then nothing.... found this video by accident, and what a wonderful find.  Of course, I would watch Judy Davis in anything, even a movie about cleaning stalls in Union Terminal.  Marcia Gay Harden was an absolute delight.  The only real flaw in the movie, to me, was the little butch.  For some reason, she grated.  But, still five stars for Ms. Davis and Ms. Harden. If you can find the video, rent it.  Ms. Davis' facial expressions are worth the rental fee.",1057276800,5,557,4.465346534653466
1744994,4,B00006FDA2,"Found the video by accident, but what a pleasant diversion. JUDY DAVIS and MARCIA GAY HARDEN together! And such a delirious plot! Perfect? NO. Got some inconsistencies, OKAY. In a world of overblown, overhyped, overmarketed disappointments, this was an unexpected delight.",1056758400,,272,5.658536585365853
1744995,4,B00006FDA2,"If you are familiar with the wacky but gloriously fun architecture of Gaudi, with all the monuments to his gifts collected in Barcelona, then you will have an inkling of the pleasures in store for you in this little treasure of a film GAUDI AFTERNOON.  Almost as a metaphor for the way life imitates Gaudi's art, this well written, photographed and acted film is so off the beaten track that that it slipped by the major theaters who search for the Big Movies, often neglecting these fine ornaments.  In short, this is a story of an expatriated American, at odds with her own life and family, who settles temporarily in Barcelona to translate a South American novel from Spanish into English.  In the midst of her tedious ad frustrating life pops what appears to be a glamourous femme fatale who hires our bored translator to find her estranged husband.  And that is all the plot you get.  All of the characters she encounters in her tidbit of detective work are uniquely different from what they appear. In the end all turns out well, but it is the getting there that is so much fun!  With actessses such as Judy Davis, Marcia Gay Harden, Lily Taylor, and Juliette Lewis expect the best of work.  These women are gifted comediennes and the director and cinematographer use them as embellishments visually and emotionally and sarcastically to the wondrously photographed architecture of Gaudi. This movie is rich in color, in imagination, in acting, and in joy.  Treat yourself!",1039305600,23,1478,4.791338582677166
1744996,5,B00006FDA2,"What a pleasant surprise. An extra star for the surprise. Shame on the studio for tossing this film away. And why they ever decided to market this as a Lesbian film I'll never know. Anyway, I smiled through the whole thing, and laughed loudly over many little moments. It's all about the actors looking like they are having a really good time making a silly yet thoughtful film. And what a great cast. It's a small little piece of entertainment with lots to offer without hitting you over the head with typical Hollywood grossness. Best not to know a lot about the slim plot- just watch it and enjoy.",1038355200,18,600,4.513761467889908
1744997,5,B00006FDA2,"I loved this film. It was a sweet little surprise when I happned on to it.
Of course I love Judy Davis...she can do no wrong. Beyond that the film has a great story line. All the actors give great performances.
Check it out!!",1038355200,5,225,4.136363636363637
1744998,4,B00006FDA2,"Gaudi of the title is, of course, Antonio Gaudi, one of the most famous architecht of the world, and you may remember the unique form of The Church of Saglada Familia, in Barcelona.  This film follows the journey of Cassandra, amateur translater turned amateur detective, who wanders in the maze of sexuality in this beautiful city situated in Catalonia.
But don't misunderstand here.  This is an off-beat comedy, so you see no blood or dead body.  Actually, it is delectable Judy Davis you will see, and as Cassandra she is at her best since her role in ""Children of Revolution.""  Cassandra, born in Missigan, is now living in a narrow apartment in Barcelona, where she landed some years ago.  She is making her ends meet by translating a Spanish book into English, but finds herself no longer capable of the job.  Facing the danger of eviction, she meets a mysterious visitor Frankie, who asks her to find a person named Ben.  Reluctantly she accepts the offer, but it is only the begining of her new life among the colorful, unconventional people living in this city.
I refrain from mentioning the further development of the story, because there are many twists and turns in it.  Not that the story is difficult to follow; rather, you will find the film is challenging our concepts on sexuality and family.  Director Susan Seidelman (known for ""Desperately Seeking Susan,"" one of the decent films Madonna made) knows what she is doing, presenting the portraits of characters as unique as Gaudi's works, and many of them will easily and elusively slip away from our ideas about gender, which are formed from their outward looks.
So, relax and enjoy the complicated web of sexuality, and as  Judy Davis's character is, you will be always comfortably deceived.  As I said, Davis is superb, and Marcia Gay Harden is  also effective.  You see Juliette Lewis (as April, always with some smell of illegal substance) and Lili Taylor too.  For Spanish film fans, you find Pedro Armodbar regular Maria Barranco, and from England Christopher Bowen appears as a magician (whose sensual singing is a stand-out).
Always pleasant, and surprising, the film keeps on going not in a straight way, like the undulating forms of Gaudi architechture.  Speaking of which, you can see many Gaudi's works in Barcelona, from the distant view of Saglada Familia, to the apartment house where Judy Davis stakes out to photograph the still unknown character Ben.  You may say that the city itself is the leading actor of the film, and perhaps you are right.  The film is as original and free from conventional views on sex, and succeeds to make its point without being heavy or dogmatic.  The story inevitably looks muddled at the end, but still the film offers something very unique, and idiosyncratic.",1034640000,11,2777,4.872340425531915
