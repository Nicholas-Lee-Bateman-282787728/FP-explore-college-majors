8048376,5,B0007LPSLI,Excellent documentaries.  These documentaries provide excellent material on three of the most important times in the history of our nation.,1438387200,,139,5.95
8048377,4,B0007LPSLI,A must see for any WWII buffs and those who still think the USA knew about Pearl Harbour (I was one of them until I saw this video).  Very interesting.  I found out so many things I didn't know before!!,1384300800,,202,4.025
8048378,5,B0007LPSLI,"A fascinating documentary, particularly on Reagan, yet on Roosevelt, we are given a one-sided view on how necessary it was for Roosevelt to
sidetrack the US Constitution and how he knew better than the American people, the Congress, and the Constitution itself, as commentated by, irony of ironies,
William Jefferson Clinton.  The documentary wishes us to be grateful that Roosevelt deceived the American people for years, and
deliberately provoked war.  It would have been more interesting to have had a commentator question, rather than praise, the illegal activities of Roosevelt, even
in the backdrop of victory in the war.
The account is given in story form, which is effective, with terrific narration and a solid musical score.",1362960000,4,734,5.264957264957265
8048379,5,B0007LPSLI,"i really liked this.  so much of network news (especially pre-fox) was leftward leaning, and afraid to make the points this dvd makes (combining liberals and conservatives -- refreshing mix.)  very very cool.",1302739200,3,208,5.2727272727272725
8048380,5,B0007LPSLI,"This was a great documentary.  The section on Reagan was superb.  I could have done w/o slick Willie's comments on Johnson however.  Nevertheless, it is a wonderfully in depth look at three very different yet intriguing presidents.  Morgan Freeman is an excellent commentator.",1301875200,3,276,5.348837209302325
