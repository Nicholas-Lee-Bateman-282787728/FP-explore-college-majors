8532248,5,B002N36MMM,"As a longtime ""Good Eats"" fan, I obviously appreciate Alton Brown's quirky science with bad puns in the greatest cooking show of all time, and I learn more from Brown than I have from anyone else (OK, except my Mom...) or any  cooking book I have read. I particularly like it when he takes fairly ordinary ingredients we often take for granted and turns them on their head, and there's plenty of that here.

This DVD includes the episodes ""Melon Drama"", ""Cobbled Together"", and the hour-long special from Hawaii, ""Down and Out in Paradise"". I admit that I don't love most melons, particularly watermelon, but with ""Melon Drama"" Brown has got me thinking about them in a different way, and I'm ready to give them another shot, starting with his recipe for ""Melon Sorbet"", though I'm fairly certain I do not want to try ""Hot Melon Salad"" (and certainly don't want to go through the preparation involved). Both recipes are included in the handy mini recipe booklet enclosed with the DVD, as are the key recipes from the other episodes as well.

By far my favorite episode was ""Cobbled Together"" because I haven't ever met a cobbler that I don't like. Here he makes ""Rhubarb Peach Cobbler"" (with a special guest appearance by an overly jocular Grim Reaper!), ""Individual Berry Crisps"" (yum), and my favorite (and favorite named) dish of the DVD, ""Blackberry Grunt"". Believe me it's far more appetizing than the name might lead you to believe! ""Down and Out in Paradise"" sees Alton scavenging for survival in a tropical environment in one of three hour-long ""Good Eats"" specials. The dishes he prepares are all over the map, from ""Island Ceviche With Pickled Onions"" (no, thanks!) to ""Chocolate Coconut Balls"" (yes, please!) The cooking methods are somewhat...unorthodox, even for Brown, but it's a lot of fun and extremely educational, particularly from a nutritional geography (if that's a real thing) standpoint.

""The Ripe Stuff"" is truly one of the great ""Good Eats"" DVDs: it's funny, it's offbeat, it's educational, and it's delicious!",1439251200,2,2036,4.944444444444445
