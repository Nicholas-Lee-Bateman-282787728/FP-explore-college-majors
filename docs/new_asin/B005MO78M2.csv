8479511,5,B005MO78M2,"First off, this isn't really an Italian import. It is a German or Swiss import.

Unlike the American Hannah Montana Complete Season 1 and Hannah Montana Forever box sets with their metallic glittery boxes and artistically elaberate menus, this import is fairly bare bones: The box is just a photo of a glittery background, there is a conspicuously empty sleeve inside the box, and the menus are pretty generic...
But who cares? The DVDs feature all the episodes of Season 2 including a few extra features -all available in the original english audio among multiple other languages.

Disney may refuse to release Season 2 & 3 in North America but with various DVD software that can bypass copy protection, this boxset can be successfully copied to region 1 or region free discs playable on North American DVD players. Search Google or Bing for phrases like ""copy region free encrypted DVDs"" to find good software. There are a few good ones that are freeware and a really popular and fab one (that I won't mention here) that can be downloaded for free which includes many unnecessary features to monkey around with for a trial period that aren't necessary for decrypting and copying DVDs. Nero and other DVD software typically included with new computers won't work. Such software can't copy copy-protected discs.

If you have at least 4 blank 8.5 GB dual layer DVDs, a computer with a dual layer DVD burner, and appropriate DVD copying software, you can indeed copy and watch all the episodes of Season 2 on your standard North American NTSC ""region 1"" DVD player in english, french, italian, german, spanish, and turkish without any problems.
If you only have an oldschool single layer DVD burner, your software can likely compress the Season 2 DVDs to lower quality video that can be burned to standard 4.7GB blank DVDs.
-Of course, make sure these are legal backup copies of original DVDs that you own for personal viewing only.

My only complaint is that all the print on the box including the episode list is in German: The episode ""Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas"" is amusingly titled ""Die Jonas Brothers"" (LOL)
Otherwise, I am very delighted with this purchase.",1370649600,5,2180,4.820855614973262
