7903894,3,B0000067N6,"This tape is great for those who want a daily quick stretch.  Segments are 7-9 minutes.  I was however overall disappointed in the tape.  All segments are splices from other Firm videos and transitions seem rough to me. (That, and I hate paying a premium price for recycled workouts!)
I also found it rather fast-paced for a stretch video and therefore not relaxing at all.  Bottom line - if all you have is 10 minutes a day then this video will probably work for you.  If you're looking for a really good stretch with some relaxation - look elsewhere.",994723200,10,552,4.5353535353535355
7903895,5,B0000067N6,"If you only have a few minutes each day to stretch (only 6 to 8 minutes), this tape is the way to go.  It will increase your flexibility, elongate your muscles, and help you develop better balance.
At first a few of these stretches may seem challenging ... but those are the ones that are the best for flexibility and balance.  Just keep at it and both will improve!
Stretching is so important to relaxation and overall health ... this tape really helps bust the myth of ""not enough time"" ...
These segments are not slow and yoga-like ... they are shorter stretches, each done more quickly than traditional stretching.  But it gets the job done ... quickly.",984700800,6,657,4.5508474576271185
7903896,3,B0000067N6,"This tape is compiled from the classic series of Firm tapes.  The instructors are really limber, and they tend to stretch their muscles in ways that regular people can't comfortably do.  You  can modity the  stretches, however, to fit your body.  It's a decent tape, but it's  outdated.",934761600,8,286,4.854166666666667
