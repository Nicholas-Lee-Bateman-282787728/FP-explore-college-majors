8020691,1,B00022LI3Y,"This disc came to me as part of a large, 10-DVD set from Alpha Video called ""50s Comedy.""  The prospect of having a collection of REAL TV sitcoms from television's ""golden age"" was exciting, but my purchase was a huge disappointment.  I won't repeat all of the complaints about video and audio quality that have been amply stated in other reviews.  I will, however, express my frustration over the fact that Alpha Video hasn't even gone to the bother of providing episode titles.  If you're going to put a product such this on the market, why not do it right?

The other discs in my ""50s Comedy"" set -- containing episodes of ""Burns and Allen,"" ""You Bet Your Life,"" ""Meet Corliss Archer,"" ""I Married Joan,"" ""The Jack Benny Program,"" ""My Hero,"" ""Private Secretary,"" ""Topper,"" and ""Trouble with Father"" -- have also been issued singly and are sold by Amazon.  Most of these discs are designated ""Volume 1"" of the sitcom series.  Like the ""Ozzie and Harriet"" DVD, they all lack any mention of episode titles.  If you search the Amazon listings for any DVDs offering these programs, watch out for Alpha Video as the source, and please consider boycotting the company's products until Alpha Video decides to extend to its customers the courtesy of identifying exactly what they've bought.",1234137600,6,1283,4.82648401826484

8020693,5,B00022LI3Y,MY HUSBAND AND I THOUGHT THAT 'THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE AND HARRIET' WAS CLASSIC 1950'S TV. IT WAS GREAT NOSTALGIA. WE LOVED THE COMERCIALS.,1155859200,2,139,4.833333333333333
8020694,5,B00022LI3Y,"Some of us remeber this series from childhood, and it is just as filled with family warmth and humor now.  This is about a real family, not actors.  Real people with real family values.

This is what situation, family comedy used to be, with moral lessons as well as lots of wholesome fun.",1151625600,8,289,4.415094339622642
