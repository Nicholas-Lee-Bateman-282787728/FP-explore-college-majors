3916627,5,B002EAYDOI,"I have been looking for this video for some time now. I finally found it and I love it! It brings back so many memories of 60's and 70s. ( my era)
It is all good. The case and all is in perfect condition.
Plus it's a really good movie.
Thank You so much!",1297728000,2,254,3.7222222222222223
3916628,5,B002EAYDOI,"pool scene. It's 35 years on & pretty tame stuff now. Free love, (pre-AIDS) good dope, music & I remember it, er.. most of it. I love this movie, finally seeing it again after all this time. I froze a frame of Ms. Hershey's beautiful, youthful smile. It lights up the room. The plot: Thirty-something yuppies Jay (Sam Groom) & Suzanne (Collin Wilcox-Horner) want to have a child, but Suzanne can't conceive. They hire Tish, to have a baby with Jay, the old fashioned way, so that at least Jay will have a biological heir. It's funny, & it's sad. Tish loses her boyfriend Ted, in Scott Glenn's first role, because they can't have sex & she won't do drugs for nine months. It's  bittersweet too as Tish gives the baby boy to Suzanne & Jay as they leave to start their new life as parents. A new oldie classic.",1130457600,4,807,4.38
3916629,3,B002EAYDOI,"With surrogate motherhood now virtually a mainstream reproductive option, attention should be paid to this Sixties time-capsule (protest street theater!) that explored the idea first. (That Ms. Hershey, then at the peak of her youthful loveliness, takes an impromptu skinny dip has nothing to do with it. Really!)",983491200,3,313,5.541666666666667
8367329,5,B002EAYDOI,"I love this movie very much, it plays very good. I had it in a VHS ,but I wanted to buy it in a DVD. Its hard to fine VHS players how days so that is why I wanted it in a DVD. Its always been my favorite movie.",1528416000,,210,3.306122448979592
8367330,4,B002EAYDOI,"It's too bad this movie didn't age better, because the topic is still relevant.  Back then, the world seemed to contain more promise and less hate.  My advice is to pour a glass of wine, curl up on the couch and Netflix this movie.",1512950400,,231,4.2272727272727275
8367331,5,B002EAYDOI,"This is about a couple who hire a woman to become impregnated by the man and carrty the baby to term. It's intersting in that you at first feel sorry for the wife, satying at home while her husband if off haveing sex, then you feel sorry fot the other woman once the baby is born and she is left out. hard to find, and highly recommended.",1484784000,,338,4.059701492537314

8367333,5,B002EAYDOI,"I'm so glad this movie is finally available on dvd.  I remember watching it on late night network television back in the eighties, and it stayed with me.  I still cry at the end.  If you like movies that have a flower child, 1960s feel, and the music from that time, you'll probably like this.  Dvd contains the original music from the movie.",1462406400,,342,4.380952380952381
8367334,3,B002EAYDOI,"Not quite as good as I remembered it, but still entertaining. I'm glad I added it to my collection.",1455926400,,99,4.2631578947368425
8367335,5,B002EAYDOI,A great movie,1439424000,,13,3.6666666666666665
8367336,5,B002EAYDOI,"Although it is somewhat dated [surrogate mothers tend not to be the biological ones these days] the movie is very sweet and sheds a light on those couples in the 1960s who suffered infertility. So much progress has been made today and I am grateful for that. As always, Barbara Hershey'sm performance is strident and stunning.",1422835200,2,326,4.839285714285714
8367337,5,B002EAYDOI,I am a devotee of made-for-TV movies from the 70's and 80's. This is one of the great ones. It is well written and acted and deals with a theme thoughtfully and ahead of its time. Recommended viewing.,1391731200,,200,4.2894736842105265
8367338,3,B002EAYDOI,"This movie really reflects the attitudes and ideas of the 1970's.  It is a product of its time period in many ways and I found it interesting to watch.

The movie script provided an opportunity to see Barbara Hershey as a 20 something year old fully nude, when she goes skinny dipping in the pool, but the camera shots are from behind and across the pool.  What a waste of a golden opportunity!",1327622400,,394,4.36986301369863
