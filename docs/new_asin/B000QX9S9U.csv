8197917,4,B000QX9S9U,"Franz and Polina is about Franz, a SS-soldier finding himself in a White-Russian village in 1942. Instead of killing the village-population, as his commanding officer intends to, he falls in love with a Russian girl, Polina, although they have no language in common. At the deciding moment, he kills his officer, saves her life, and suddenly finds himself on the other camp. The Russians are not happy with a German in their midst, and a complex relationship starts. The film illustrates there is no safe grey area between friend and enemy in war-time, however hard two lovers try to find one. The film is after a novella of Ales Adamovich, a well-known expert on World War II in Russia. The story is not an easy black and white rendering of the problem of enmity. Although the story is a bit far fetched (SS-ers turning against themselves in enemy-territory is not very probable), it nevertheless is a film in the best humanist traditions of Russian culture.",1295395200,2,959,4.818181818181818

Drama keeps you glued to the set.  These days when most movies are remakes, this was yet a refresing new approach to movie making.  More original movies like this please!",1255824000,4,324,4.551724137931035
