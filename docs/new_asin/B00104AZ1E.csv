8236907,5,B00104AZ1E,Great acting and story. Muzammil Ibrahim did amazing and I wish he starred in more South Asian movies. The film touches on a controversial topic and how Muslims are treated in India. It definitely needed more positive attention than it received.,1521417600,,245,5.0
8236908,4,B00104AZ1E,"I have just recently watched this movie unexpectedly. Never heard about the trailers nor the main actors in it, however the acting done here is far more superior then some known actors! The direction was great, the storyline was even better! The movie basically deals with the whole Muslims being hated upon in India and how some decide to join the evil side.
It's the type of movie that keeps you involved in the story, and makes you interested right till the end. The beginning song is great, the rest are not so bad. I'm giving it a 9 / 10, because not every movie's perfect.",1304467200,,578,4.462264150943396
8236909,3,B00104AZ1E,"Although his acting career has unfortunately since fizzled, model Muzammil Ibrahim shows enormous potential in his film debut as Zaid, an honest and dedicated cop who calmly endures prejudice as a Muslim. After his girlfriend Nandini (Aushima Sawhney) jilts him because her parents disapprove of their relationship, Zaid agrees to an arranged marriage to a woman he doesn't know--the sweet and lovely Sarah (Tulip Joshi), whom he quickly comes to love. But his happy home life is shattered when his wife is killed in a terrorist bombing--and it turns out she was the suicide bomber. He's appalled by his ignorance about his wife, and after he's cleared of any involvement in the crime, he sets out to find those who instigated Sarah's actions and he learns the horrifying reason she did it. The film is preachy in parts and at times implausible, but its balanced portrayal of the ugliness of hate is disturbing and enlightening. It's not in any way sympathetic to terrorists, but it explores how someone who has been grievously persecuted could be manipulated to evil ends. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1255737600,,1308,5.712820512820513
