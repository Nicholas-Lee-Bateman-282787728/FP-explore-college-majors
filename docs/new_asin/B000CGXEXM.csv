8099046,2,B000CGXEXM,"I suppose from the beginning I should point out that DARNA MANA HAI is SUBTITLED since I realize that not everyone gets turned on by having to read a movie. Still others seemed perturbed and even confused that Bollywood films frequently have sentences or several lines of dialogue in English for no apparent reason. I can't imagine why anyone would have a problem with lines occasionally being spoken in English, to me it seems quite natural when you consider that for over three hundred years or so India was ruled by the British.

 As a long time horror fan however, what I had problems with when it came to DARNA MANA HAI was the unoriginality of the film. I was looking forward to seeing what the world of Bollywood horror was like and if this is all there is then I might as well go back to watching the crud that comes out of Hollywood. The anthology form has been used to death but can still be effective as long as the individual stories are interesting. Here, alas, they were not. Only the Hitchhiker segment broke the mold, although the Apple story was interesting because it was an oddity; a woman buys apples from a street vendor at a ridiculous low price only to find that they have a terrible effect on all those who eat them. The film has a vague wrap-around story and the usual twist that can be seen coming a mile away, but it did give an unusual shading to that ending that I won't give away in case you're reading this and still have an interest in seeing the film. I would advise against renting it however, if you are a true horror fan. You've seen most of this before and certainly Bollywood must be something better to offer when it comes to horror than this.",1253318400,,1682,4.405144694533762
