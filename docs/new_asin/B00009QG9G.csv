7992735,4,B00009QG9G,"This set serves as a nice introduction to the Roy Rogers canon at a very reasonable price.  There are three DVDs in the box; each disc has four films from a different stage in Rogers' career, plus an episode from his TV series as a bonus.

The first disc, entitled ""King of the Cowboys"" includes films from the second stage of Rogers' career - his films were no longer set in the Old West, but in modern times when cowboys and their trusty steeds shared the town streets with Chevys and Fords.  Films on this disc are Silver Spurs (1943); South of Santa Fe (1942); Sunset Serenade (1942), and King of the Cowboys (1943).  The TV episode on this disc is Desert Fugitive, from the show's first season.

The second disc, ""Cowboy Troubadour"" features films from Rogers' ""Oklahoma"" career phase - according to legend, Republic Studios president Herbert Yates saw the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical on the Broadway stage and ordered Roy's films to be stuffed with lavish production numbers.  These films are also important because they are among the first to pair Roy with his soon-to-be wife Dale Evans.  Featured are Lights of Old Santa Fe (1944); San Fernando Valley (1944), The Yellow Rose of Texas (1944) and Song of Nevada (1944).  The TV episode is Haunted Mine of Paradise Valley, also from the show's first season.

The third disc, ""Cowboy Trails"" features four films from Rogers' ""Witney"" period.  When famed serial director William Witney returned from serving in World War II, Republic assigned him to direct all of Roy's films.  Music was deemphasized and replaced with hard-hitting, hard-riding action.  Films included on this disc are Bells of San Angelo (1947), On the Old Spanish Trail (1947), Springtime in the Sierras (1947) and Grand Canyon Trail (1948).  Range War, from the fifth season of Rogers' TV series, is the episode included on this disc.

Most of these films have been restored, or at least taken from a quality print, and many are hard to find on other budget sets.  Of the 12 movies, only Sunset Serenade is rather dark and muddy; but in defense of the distributor, all other prints I've seen of the film are equally mediocre.  The Trucolor print used for Bells of San Angelo is the best I've seen - the bright desert scenery is particularly vivid.  This set's other Witney-era films were originally filmed in color, however the distributor used (excellent) black and white prints.

I would have rated this set as five stars if not for one significant caveat - half the films (Silver Spurs, Sunset Serenade, San Fernando Valley, The Yellow Rose of Texas, Song of Nevada and Springtime in the Sierras) are from prints edited down to 54 minutes for television -- four to 22 minutes of footage having been eliminated.

7992736,4,B00009QG9G,"A great collection! They have one great color episode not to mention the additional 3 episode of the show, which I remember as a kid.

What a great price for these hard to find titles, including San Fernando Valley, which was unavailable in other collections. Hope they come up with more of these 3 disc collections.",1172793600,3,316,4.642857142857143
7992737,2,B00009QG9G,"Be forewarned....the very opening of all of the movies on this set have been truncated. The source for these transfers is evidently a program hosted by Roy and Dale in their later years. While I have no problem with the DVD's containing the intros, I did not pay for movies that are not in their entirety...COMPLETE opening credits and all.
Secondly, the source is not good either. Roan Group did a much better job with their Roy Roger movie transfers.
In spite of being ""Authorized by the Roy Rogers Estate""...which made me think they were a safe purchase....these Happy Trails Theatre DVD's are anything BUT high quality.",1080259200,39,623,4.831775700934579
