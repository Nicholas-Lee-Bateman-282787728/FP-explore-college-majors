6815965,5,B00PKRMAV0,"I have an 18 month old who has very little interest in TV shoes or cartoons.  For example, she LOVES Mickey Mouse and even that show she will watch for about 2 minutes and lose interest.  I have noticed she really likes music, especially nursery rhymes and kids songs so I decided to look for a DVD that had animated songs.  I came across these Super Simple Song DVDs and thought I would give them a try.  I bought Volume 1 first and then she loved it so much I bought Volume 2.  She gets so excited about these DVDs and it has become part of our bedtime routine.  I was so amazed at how she will sit and watch because she won't do that with any other show.  We only let her watch them in the morning and before bed, but she can't get enough.  She will watch the whole DVD and be upset when we turn it off.  I love these DVDs because they teach her things in addition to entertaining her.  She is recognizing colors, letters, and numbers so well and I know these DVDs have helped with that.  She loves the One Little Finger song and will do all the motions with it.  The color songs are so good because they really animate well to teach the colors.  I could go on and on about how much we love each song.  I am so impressed with the quality of these discs and how perfect they are for a toddler.  I thought the first one was really good and this one is even better.
My one and only small complaint would be with the Happy and You Know It Song.  Some people may not agree with me but I don't like that it says 'if you are angry stomp your feet' or if you are 'scared say oh no'.  One I just don't like her singing about negative emotions and two I don't think it is a good idea to teach her to stomp her feet when she is angry.  Stomping can lead to kicking and I don't like that the song is teaching her to do that.  I never heard a happy and you know it version that mentions negative emotions until this version and I wasn't pleased with it.  But I just skip over that song so it is no biggie.
The rest of the songs are great though and I am so grateful for these DVDs.  It is so fun to watch them with my daughter and to see her so excited about them.  It is the first thing she has liked so much for so long.  Very happy with these products!",1435708800,4,2245,3.9620535714285716

I also teach Down Syndrome children English as a second language, and these songs have been a huge success. The parents can't believe how well the kids picked up the words and ideas, and can have a short conversation in English. I highly recommend this for English-speaking young children (under 6) or for children who are learning English as a second language (ages 0-10, and older if they are mentally challenged).",1433462400,,518,4.9655172413793105

Since we lack home internet this was the alternative. We went ahead and purchsed both 1 & 2. The first DVD doesn't seem to capture his interest as much but he loves the 2nd DVD. Would have been nice to be able to buy in a set and I would have done if it was an option.
The DVD lasts around 35 minutes and there is an option to repeat play which I like. Unlike some other children's DVDs this does not contain 20 minutes of unskippable advertisements. Pop it in, load it up and click to go.
The videos are a few minutes each and have basic visuals.
 I would buy them for a friends child.",1481241600,,797,4.108974358974359
