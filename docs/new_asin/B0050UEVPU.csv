4518147,5,B0050UEVPU,"After Tetsunosuke Ichimura witnesses his parents murder by a Choushuu assassin, he vows to become strong enough to take revenge on their killer. So he decides to join the Shinsengumi, an order of powerful swordsmen who protect the city of Kyoto. Surprisingly, he manages to get in, despite the fact that at 15 he looks more like 12. But his determination and perseverance impress the Shinsengumi captains - so they let him join as a page. His new friends keep trying to tell him that one wielding a sword will inevitably spill blood, but it takes witnessing violence and bloodshed before he can really understand what it is he signed up for. Now he needs to make the decision - give up his revenge and live a normal life, or give up his soul and become a demon?

Peacemaker is an odd mix of surprisingly dark themes and lots of comedy. It also has a fairly accurate historical aspect that is very interesting. I greatly enjoyed looking up my favorite characters on Wikipedia and reading about their real life counterparts. The Shinsengumi itself is very interesting to read about. The Shinsengumi were loyal to the Shogunate and thus fought against the rebellion that lead to the Meiji government. So after a fashion they are the bad guys in history. But because they were strong and loyal swordsman, they are often romanticized in fiction. Peacemaker does a good job of showing both sides of the Shinsengumi through Tetsu's eyes. Most of the time they are silly, funny, and cheerful people. But their swords aren't there just for decoration and their hands are not clean. It takes more than just sword technique to be a samurai. Sometimes one must fight, and kill, to protect what is important.

I really enjoyed Peacemaker, enough to watch it twice and still like it. The manga it is based on is split into two halves and the anime is based on the first half, but sometimes named after the second half to which it has no relation (Peacemaker Kurogane). So the anime doesn't have a really definite ending, but it is a decent place to stop. I didn't feel like I needed to see more of the story, though I was curious as to what happened next. After I saw it the second time I tried picking up the manga to find out. That was a mistake. The series takes a serious turn to the weird and twisted. So just be happy with the anime ending.

If you enjoy samurai stories, the Shinsengumi, historical fiction, or series that mix comedy with serious stuff, then consider giving this series a try.

8451865,5,B0050UEVPU,"Absolutely one of my favorite animes! The show is darker themed and has some foul language,sexual implications, and violence so younger kids may not be the best audience. However, my nephews have asked to re-watch it several times as the main character is a young boy dealing with the concept of true strength. Historically, it's a fairly accurate re-telling of the Shinsengumi but there are some obvious character flairs especially in Okita Souji. Overall, it's truly a gem in story-telling and historical fiction and still stands as one of my all time favorites.",1409011200,,564,5.075268817204301

8451867,5,B0050UEVPU,"I love history, culture, sword art and humour.  Plus I love a great story and am beginning to find some wonderful ANIMES this one it really a rare find.  Strong characters with interesting story arcs and the amazing thing is that this anime is based on real life people.  Artistic licenses are taken but from what I found out this is the closest thing to the real story.  If you like Samurai Champloo, Hakuouki Reimeiroku, Hakuouki, Hakuki Hekketsuroku or Rurouni Kenshin you may like this one.  It does't have any supernatural or altered humans like in the Hakuouki series but it doesn't need it.  ENJOY  Ohh the seller send these items in excellent condition",1396483200,,660,4.7368421052631575
8451868,3,B0050UEVPU,"for a one time viewing the show was ok. it is not really a samurai show or a comedy it is both but not enough of one or the other to make it good. the voice actors in this show are a little weak they emotion was again either way too much or not there. I think if they wanted to this could have been a really good action show if they just took out some of the comedy and made it more about a "" puppy boy "" learning how to be a samurai.",1373587200,,434,3.5789473684210527
8451869,3,B0050UEVPU,"Tetsunosuke Ichimura vows to avenge the murder of his parents by joining the Shinsengumi, even if the members warn him all he will learn is how to become a demon. And then he spends twenty episodes doing chores.

I bought Peacemaker because I wanted a companion for one of my favorite series, Rurouni Kenshin. What could be better than seeing it from the side of the Shinsengumi? Sadly, Peacemaker didn't deliver. First of all, it's the reverse of Kenshin. While Kenshin is an Action series with some funny moments, Peacemaker is essentially a comedy, with some dramatic moments. I mean, that cover is a lie - Tesunosuke doesn't wear the uniform of the Shinsengumi until episode 22, and it's only a 24 episode series.

I can give the series one compliment, it looks great. I couldn't spot any imperfections in the animation as I was watching. The opening and ending themes are good. And I like the characters, I just wish they had something to do! I mean, there are some dramatic bits, but they're mainly at the end of the series. I feel this should have been a 13 episode series.

Peacemaker is not bad by any stretch, but it should be considered a comedy first. I give it 3-out-of-5 Stars.",1356825600,3,1191,4.6084905660377355
