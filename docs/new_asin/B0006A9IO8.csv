8040944,5,B0006A9IO8,"Let me say first that I directed this film for television so obviously I am biased. But I love this film and what it has to say. It is a very tough minded work and the performances by Dabney Coleman, Peter Coyote and Liam Neeson are first rate. (Coleman won an Emmy for this role). I would hope people respond to the courageous, principled position that the lawyers stick to. Their holding to the principle of law in the face of harsh criticism from the community is heroic. This film was based on the book, ""Priveleged Information"" by Frank Armani. This was a true case.

8040945,3,B0006A9IO8,"Among the many legal/courtroom dramas I've seen, this one is no real standout.  Some better than average acting and an interesting legal principle are appealing, but the plot and character interaction don't reel one in.  I've reviewed several better flicks of this type...or just follow your own tastes to something more compelling.",1161561600,2,332,5.365384615384615
