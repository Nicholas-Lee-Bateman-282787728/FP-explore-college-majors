2260572,5,B0009298Z2,"I've been playing bass by ear for a while and wanted to start learning how to read. This DVD was what I needed to get started. The instructor is easy going and informative, making the experience enjoyable. I recommend this.",1231286400,13,223,4.6
2260573,5,B0009298Z2,"A year ago one of our local music stores asked us to do a review of this DVD.  Since that time we have recommended it to many of our own students as a great supplement to the companion book, Bass Method Book I (2nd edition), also by Ed Friedland.  The feedback we get from them is that they enjoy having something to visually work with between lessons.  They like the completeness of the material and the step-by-step approach used to present it.

In addition to it being very well filmed (excellent angles and close ups so you can really tell how to position and use the fingers) all of the examples demonstrated are well structured, musically interesting and fun (no ""Three Blind Mice"" here!).  Here is an outline of each ""chapter"".

Intro
1. Startup
2. Playing Technique
3. Reading Music (standard notation & TAB)
4. Notes on the E String
5. Notes on the A String
6. Notes on the D String
7. Notes on the G String
8.  time and Rests
9. Eighth Notes & Eighth Rests
  10. Notes in Third Position
  11. Position Shifting & Box Shapes
  12. Songs
  13. Closing/Credits

The Startup takes you through an explanation of the parts of the electric bass, the bass amp (and tone/volume settings), finding a good position for holding the bass, and tuning.

Playing Technique covers: Right hand; how to play using fingers or pick, Left hand positioning and fingering.

Reading Music covers the concept of rhythm and pitch, the musical alphabet and how it works on the staff, the duration of notes, the time signature and so forth.  He walks you through some easy examples reading and playing notes using a split screen so you can see him playing the strings as the notation scrolls below.  The notes and beat are highlighted so you can see exactly where you are.  It's probably the best concept of note reading and playing presentation I've seen in years.

Each chapter introducing notes on each string uses the same procedure mentioned above.  Natural notes and sharped and flatted notes are covered.  Practice ""jam tracks"" are provided to make playing and note reading fun.

This holds true for the remainder of the DVD.  At the end, bass parts for six well known popular songs are provided.  Again, these are presented in split screen showing right and left hand fingering plus the notation scrolling below.

Songs included are:
""Imagine"" by John Lennon
""Whiter Shade of Pale"" by Procol Harum
""Lady Madonna"" by The Beatles
""Taking Care of Business"" by BTO's
""All the Small Things"" by Blink 182
""My Girl"" by The Temptations

Ed introduces important features of playing each tune, which is a great way to learn how simple ideas can be (and were) used to make cool bass lines.

If you're looking for good solid instruction that guides you step by step, like you would find from lessons with a quality private teacher, then GET THIS DVD!

To your musical success!!

2260581,2,B0009298Z2,"I bought this for my 14-year-old son who recently decided to give the bass a try after watching me play it for so long. While I can teach him what I know, I wanted him to learn how to read sheet music, which I have limited experience with (I just play by ear).

Seeing as how this is marketed to the ""beginning electric bassist,"" I thought I'd give it a try for him. BAD DECISION ON MY PART! I can't believe how rapid the instructor moves through the lessons. My son had this blank look on his face during the first 30 minutes and I could tell that he was not absorbing a thing. This DVD really needs an instructional booklet to follow along with.

I do NOT recommend you waste your money on this DVD. I ordered ""Bass Guitar for Dummies"" yesterday (although he's NO dummy) because those series of instructional books do a great job at explaining the subject very well. After he finishes the book, he may revisit this DVD. We'll see how it goes.",1402531200,3,944,4.297752808988764

2260583,4,B0009298Z2,"For some reason, I thought I was getting the book and the DVD but only got the DVD.  Then I read the description again and sure enough, it's just the DVD.  So it pays to READ before you buy.  But it's still good.  I did, however, go to a music store and buy the book because I need to see the music.

2260585,5,B0009298Z2,"This book is actually three books in one and the contains three DVDs. The books are well written and the DVDs are very clear and you can backup what you don't understand and play it again. The two best how to do books and DVDs that are purchased are Bass Method: For the Beginning of Electric Bassist and Bass Guitar for Dummies. I have advanced Parkinson's disease which makes playing difficult, but with the two books and DVDs that I just mentioned I am able to go over and over until I am able to do it correctly.",1372204800,,516,4.275510204081633

2260592,5,B0009298Z2,"Ed Friedland is quite pallatable in this DVD--not hoaky at all. Fact is, he's not daunting or haughty about his instruction and that makes it super easy to swallow the tricky part of learning to play the bass.  I recommend this one--wish Ed Friedland had cut more DVD's on the bass !  Sound track quality is tops compared to most other Bass instructional DVD's.",1315008000,,361,4.625
2260593,5,B0009298Z2,"This is the complete package; an ideal resource for the beginner.  Learing the bass guitar, of necessity means learning to ""read"" music & musical charts. Anyone can ""learn"" to play an instrument ""by ear"", however, to become technically proficient and to advance to the level of acquiring mastery with the bass guitar you will want to read music.  This book, along with the instructional DVD and CD will give the beginner an excellent foundation, not only because ofits clear instruction and interactive approach to bass-playing technique but also because of its very understandable instruction and demonstration in the practice of reading music in the bass clef!  Well paced, easy to follow and practice to, entertaining - you will be glad you started here as you learn to play bass!",1313712000,,783,5.054263565891473

2260595,5,B0009298Z2,"I would recommend this DVD tutorial for a beginning bassist--- I have learned quite a bit from being able to follow the very well laid out lesson chapters. I was not aware of how well Ed Friedland was going to cover studying recognition of ""reading music"" but I think he covers it very well---It is very challenging to try and learn to recognize / read the music and also be able to play quickly but that's what learning is all about!! It isn't easy but is well rewarding--- I will continue to learn from this DVD and enjoy the fact that you can go back over each chapter and still pick up a lot of great knowledge--- It gets a ""thumbs-up"" from me---",1254700800,13,650,4.2926829268292686

8056626,5,B0009298Z2,I have been playing guitars for years and have always liked to pick up a bass and pluck it. I finally decided to buy my own to learn to actually play it. Once I got this DVD I realized I was already beyond what is taught on most of this video but I still learned some details I didn't know. It is very good as intended for a total beginner and is a very good value for what it teaches so I recommend it.,1440374400,,403,3.8095238095238093

8056628,1,B0009298Z2,"I guess there's some information in there but Mr friedland is utterly boring and dry, so much so it is impossible to learn, he never stops or repeats it's just right onto the next thing and your like wait! Even in the section that is supposed to help you tune your guitar he only plays each note ONCE, like SERIOUSLY? Tuning takes many small adjustmeets and I had to rewind like 10 times for each note. I also bought the book and it's awesome! Way better and it comes with cds for tuning and all the examples, way better than This im pretty sure it's just Mr friedlands idea to make the Manimum amount of money off of his program. The book gets a 5 out of 5 but don't be tricked by this, you won't end up using it and it's just gonna sit on your shelf.",1423785600,,752,4.087837837837838
