2517459,3,B000EF5MS6,"I had never heard of this movie before but it looked somewhat interesting and was only three bucks so I decided to take a chance on it. This film is sort of like a late 60's guerilla precursor to later parody compilations like The Groove Tube and Kentucky Fried Movie although it is nowhere nearly as funny or as well done as either. The whole point of this ""free-form"" film escaped me other than it was apparently primarily intended to mock the ""establishment"" circa 1969. It is a random assortment of brief sketches, monologues, film clips, musical performances, and ""Hippy"" political statements. There's also a fair amount of female nudity on display (if this film were rated it would be rated R). A young Richard Pryor does a number of brief monologues and a couple of sketch comedy groups (one including a young Fred Willard) do their thing, more political statements are made, there are some montages of old movies and commercials, and there are a couple of running gags which aren't that funnny. There are also some ""man in the street"" interviews (primarily about what the American flag means to various people).

Overall this thing is pretty disjointed and doesn't make a whole lot of sense...but the DVD is cheap and possibly worth the purchase price simply as a time capsule of what the radical left was thinking around 1969-70 and also as a glimpse into what underground comedy amounted to at the time.

The picture and sound quality are pretty lackluster and the DVD is obviously a direct transfer from a rather beat up print of this low budget film but is still watchable. I can't imagine anyone is ever going to bother to clean this up any further so what you see is what you get...again the price is pretty low, so taking that into account, it's okay.

Certainly not for everyone (unless you still live on a commune somewhere and/or want to watch a nun do a strip tease) but I have to admit it was somewhat interesting from a historical perspective as a filmed artifact of the late 60's (as seen through the eyes of the Woodstock generation) and as a film that was clearly meant to ""Stick it to the man"".",1185753600,5,2119,4.615384615384615

2517461,4,B000EF5MS6,"This film was recommended to me and I quickly found out it was out of print so I checked out Amazon.  The reviews listed at the time were wretched, all one star and yuck.  The film was available for 5 bucks so I bought it.  Well this film is wonderful.  It's a look at the culture of the late 60's from a youth perspective with humor and music of the time.  It's something like the first music video with a humanist, historic bent.  I think all the reviews panning this film are comming from a political viewpoint that doesn't care for anything different or critical of the status quo.",1138924800,6,585,4.321100917431193
2517462,5,B000EF5MS6,"After renting this movie I went straight to Amazon to order a copy, and I'm still reeling over all the poor reviews on this page! First, note that this is NOT a Richard Pryor comedy film, this is comedy in the field of the Monkees' ""Head"" or ""200 Motels"", very acidic, very spontaneous and creative in the way you'd expect from 60's; pissed off and confrontational with flickers of blissed-out chaos. The film is loosely narrated through sequences of Richard Pryor walking down the street with a basketball in his hand, talking and cracking jokes to the cameraman. The film tackles the usual issues of USA as police state and the protest of Vietnam, feminism, drugs, etc with Monty Python-like abandon of convention and the use of psychedelic free association. Its not linear at all, and I think that's the turn off for most Amazon folks who turned in the poor reviews, but haven't we watched too many films with the usual beginning, middle and end? If you're one of the few who get kicks out of quasi-psychedelic documentation from a pissed off and enraged generation, you'll love this film. Enjoy.",1136937600,7,1099,4.7591623036649215
2517463,1,B000EF5MS6,"This is an oddly assembled and poorly edited patchwork quilt of film clips of people and music representing the ""counterculture"" of the late 60s-early 70s era. Basically, the nude scenes, profanity, etc. seem to be more for shock value than for making any statement, and nothing seems to make any particular point. Not even good for historical purposes, it's unlikely that you would want to see this more than once, or even all the way through upon the first viewing. The Richard Pryor scenes are only mildly interesting. I recall in the reviews for Frankie Avalon's ""Back To The Beach,"" a reviewer said, ""It stinks. It smells like poo poo. "" The same is true for this film",996624000,4,673,4.711864406779661

I was looking through all the Jimi Hendrix stuff on AMAZON and came across ""Dynamite Chicken;"" even though I was around when it first came out.
It's obviously early Pryor.  I guess he was still developing.  I bought it for the Hendrix part and the other famous names in the picture.  However, I just couldn't sit through any more of it to see Hendrix of those other famous names.  Maybe one day I can get through it--especially Hendrix; not on the top of my list",1482451200,,612,5.7555555555555555

8108883,4,B000EF5MS6,This ancient Richard Pryor movie is a classic.  I bought this for my husband for just one scene.  The one with Fred Willard as a casting agent. It is HELLA funny.  By the way there are gratuitous scenes of naked women (and maybe a man or two).  This is NSFW.,1445472000,,258,4.1
8108884,4,B000EF5MS6,"Looking for something light and chuckling one night before sleep, I stumbled upon this film,
Dynamite Chicken, with Richard Pryor and many, many more.  Almost pulling a Python-a-thon, but only  ran 1 hour or so,.  But in my present mood, it was just enough. Why? you ask....Here's the thing: I grew up when all these events were otherwise known as Current Events: Economy,  Politics, Fashions, Music, Art, Society, World Policies, Wars and Other Scary Things went on, took place or were present, while my mind was soaking all this stuff up, Wow! I suddenly realized this one thing. One. Thing.  I wasn't going to be here forever. Every one needs o thing. Some do not know that rule, but it's there.  Some of the featured faces and voices are no longer alive, but look what they left us, and see what we do with what we've learned. Very Little.  But THIS ART allows us to review it in memory. You can't be prudish about One Thing.  It's called LIFE, and if you don't seize it as soon and as hard as is possible, it will slip through your grasp, elude your frantic reach.

You can tell by the length of the reviews, mostly negative and very prudish in tone, with some even showing such ignorance and lack of full memory, given that no one declares exactly WHY they don't like it....one review called it ""POO-POO. How very mature. Plus the stick up the bum keeps that perp upright , I'm sure.  Probably forgot what that era was all about, that sense of spirit and soul, woman's liberation, folk music, protest, war, more protests, violence- and see? We have it all right here, right now, in the 21st Century. So what's changed? We just have the connection of lightning speed computers, processors, digit this and that. I am happy when I attend a Renaissance Party. But the next day, I drive my mustang to work. NOT the actual horse.  Yes, these are MY times gone by, gone for good. I think this stuff should be required viewing before someone can take SS retirement, if that benefit doesn't die.
For all of this, I am happy this film was made, it gave me something now, in 2015, that I was just becoming exposed and sensitized  to, when just a child. Brings back the nostalgia of what some now say, truthfully, were the last great decades.  The 60's. A time to change, and by this film, those moments are recalled once more.  A fun visit, but I do still like where I am in time.
 Too soon gone. Now about the film, having philosophized a bit.....using energy.  I thought this should become a National Treasure, in the De[t Of Bliss, Humor and Satire.  Federal, so no one would mess with it.  It was great, saved my insomnia and could cure the world. I recommend.",1424044800,,2659,4.492723492723493

8108886,3,B000EF5MS6,"This 1.25 hour movie is like a documentary, but it's so fast moving that you can't even read the printed placards that go by, and it's kind of jumbled.  I watched this movie free on Amazon (Prime member), and I'm glad I didn't purchase it.  John Lennon's appearance is about 1 minute long (if that).  Viewing it on Amazon videos Prime for free is really good.",1370736000,,359,4.409090909090909
8108887,4,B000EF5MS6,"I have to say, I found this film (which was a collage of 60's images and a series of bold skits and sketches) to be completely hilarious, uproariously funny and right on! ""Dynamite Chicken"" was directed by Ernest Pintoff and was released in 1972. Anyway, it is really an interesting and one-of-a-kind experience. This is a time-capsule and a look back at a volatile period (just like the one right-now), in the history of this country, when things were really coming to a head. The 60's counter-culture generation never really made the lasting impact we read and talk so much about (the corporations won out in the end, no surprise there!). The powers-that-be made it their priority (via infiltration and dissension), in shutting them down fast and quick! From watching this film, we get a sense of the reason why that was. The honesty and genuine dedication a lot of the people of that generation had in making changes to the social-conditions of the world as they existed then and now were very real. Most of the opinions and ideas these people shared, were considered dangerous and a threat to the ""status-quo"" of the power-establishment. Their non-partisan and truly anti-establishment stance (they attacked both parties and their presidential candidates), in how they mocked the system (the sham-democracy we have), is something that's completely lacking and missing in today's activists. Here we get a small glimpse at: the civil-rights movement, the women's-movement, the anti-war movement, etc., etc. Without any of the bias or prejudice of---""for-or-against"", all in less than 80 mins. How can you beat a history lesson like that! And even better, it has a young Richard Pryor (in some very candid moments), giving us his street-wise philosophy and humor. Fred Willard and the Ace Trucking Co., in a series of some very funny skits (the scene of a parody of an Aqua Velva commercial was especially memorable). There was plenty of beautiful and uninhibited 60's & 70's female nudity---serving as a contrast to the morally-uptight (and downright hypocritical), socio-political views of the older and compliant predecessor-generation (via man-on-the-street interviews). But of course, even a lot of the young people had some outrageous views on the social-issues of the day. This film will bring back so many memories to those who were old enough to remember this era. The film never took itself seriously (it looks like it was shot on super-8 or 16mm), remaining true to its underground roots. This was a funny and creative send-up of the American cultural-landscape as it existed back then. This really is a forgotten gem, I hope someone restores the entire film someday (there might even be more footage out there somewhere). The DVD picture and sound quality were actually very good. NTSC, English (no subtitles or extras), NR 76 mins. (BTW: Ignore the 'R' in the description above, the film is NR.)

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1355443200,,2940,5.061855670103093
8108888,2,B000EF5MS6,"The only reason I bought this is because I'm a Richard Pryor fan. It was good to see a young Richard Pryor again and if this was just a movie of him talking about anything it would be a hundred times better. It's just bits of Pryor hanging out on the outdoor basketball playground interspersed with some unfunny skits and comments from 60s pot head political whiners. They hate the U.S. flag and let you know that they consider it nothing. That kind of thing.

It's possible that 60s and early 70s pot heads and acid droppers would really enjoy the entire movie in a room filled with black light posters and purple light blubs. They would love the attempts at President Nixon jokes. You know how those people laugh like an uncontrollable hyena. Unfortunately for those people, it's 2011 and they are all dead now.

Dynamite Chicken is a great title for a comedy but there's nothing really that funny in this movie. A comedy is supposed to be funny. The movie is so dated that you have to be between 40 and 50 to even understand the political jokes and even then, the jokes aren't funny.",1305936000,,1086,4.47979797979798
8108889,5,B000EF5MS6,"One of the best films of this type we've ever seen, dealing with the late 60's & early 70's counter-culture mix of music, comedy, etc., with some of the biggest stars-to-be of the era. Highly recommended.",1239062400,3,204,4.694444444444445
8108890,5,B000EF5MS6,"Excellent Film!!! It does a great job of taking the clothes off of the already naked emperor. Many poignant parallels with today's problems as it was made during the bombing of Vietnamese people. It attacks racism, nationalism & small-mindedness in general, in a lighthearted, brave & funny way. Slaps complacent conformists upside the head! Maybe that's why you get a lot of, ""I can't figure this one out,"" sorta reviews on it. Because this film was created as a non-linear collage of images & outtakes, it may go over the head of someone used to typical Hollywood flicks that spell out every banal detail with canned laughter. Some really clever insights in the film. Many witty parodies of this pyramid scheme that we all have come to love so much. An amazing use of reactions to the U.$. flag to delineate the intense schisms in this society (i.e. freedom vs. blind obedience). The Uber Alles attitude that people were fighting against then, is unfortunately still a cancer today.",1233878400,4,984,4.863095238095238
