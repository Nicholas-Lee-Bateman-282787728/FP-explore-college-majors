8191157,4,B000PGJ3O8,"This is a mixed review.  My 6 yo autistic son can watch this over and over, and this is my second purchase of the video since he's scratched up the first one.  I, personally, find the video boring.  Watching the same train cross over ""bridge 140"" from three different angles makes me crazy.  My son, however, loves every repetitive minute.",1386460800,,339,4.6
8191158,5,B000PGJ3O8,"Mr. Scholl, hasn't missed yet and here is another great view for steam engine buffs! Certainly the view of two steam engines side by side is a treat few ever get to see, especially these days. I was thrilled...",1364428800,,210,4.410256410256411
8191159,4,B000PGJ3O8,"What a treat!  Both my wife and I grew up in Ohio while the steam trains were still running in some locations.  Wife in southern Ohio and me in northern Ohio.  I spent many summer days down by the tracks waiting for the trains to go by.  The diesels were great too, and both my grandfathers worked for the big train lines, including the Pennsylvania Rail Road.  Dennison, Ohio was where he worked in the big yard as a brakeman.  My grandparents lived in Uhrichsville, which is mentioned in the dvd also.  What fun it was for my wife and I to see part of our past steaming by on the lines *:-)  Happy watching *:-)",1341014400,,613,4.224137931034483
