7945366,3,B00005MEUU,"The third DVD volume of the Robotech series contains six excellent but sad episodes concerning the SDF1's exploits upon its return to Earth, including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.
This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users; also, the actual menu-selection clip has fortunately been changed from the first two installments of the Robotech DVD series. Secondly, and by far the most significant problem, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked flawlessly with the PS2.",1012089600,,1035,5.023255813953488
7945367,5,B00005MEUU,When I first viewed this anime I was 14 years old and I had always saved a place to in my mind and soul... I love Japanime and would recommend the first 2 volumes sets. I purchased directly from robotech.com myself and it was worth it. But now that I know Amazon.com is carrying them... I will wait. I enjoy watching the collection I have started watching them over and over on DVD. I am sure you will too. It's all of the characters you have grown to love and more TheDVD sets give you have background bio's on all the characters cell creation process interviews plus inside scoop on Robotech the movie that was never released int he US but was released in Japan and Europe so if you liked Max Sterling and Rick Hunter from the first part of Macross trilogy you will be drooling when Max and Miria get married and create the new character Dana Sterling who hangs out with Louie watching part 2 of the trilogy will be awesome all the way to Part 3 of the trilogy of Here come the Invid. What I am writing about is my childhood and what I watched that made my idea of the possible future could be and might be. As time goes on though we still hope what could be invented may have and that these cartoons anime creators had an insight that make you dream of future posibilities....

7945368,5,B00005MEUU,"Robotech - The Macross Saga 3:  Homecoming, contains episodes 13 through 18 of the legendary anime series from the mid 1980s.
For the uninitiated, Robotech was the most popular of the Americanized Japanese anime series to hit American TV waves during the 1970s and 1980s (along with Star Blazers, Voltron, Transor Z,  etc.)  Known for its cutting edge animation, high tech battle scenes, futuristic weapons (planes, tanks, motorcyles that transform into robots), cool alien invaders, and realistic and compelling storylines, Robotech swept an entire generation and helped put Japanese Anime forever on the map of American pop culture.
Set in the 21st century, Robotech's sweeping saga spanned three seasons and weaved together three actual separate Japanese anime series:  Season 1- The Macross Saga, Season 2 - The Robotech Masters (The Southern Cross in Japan), and Season 3 - The New Generation (Mospeada in Japan).  The basic story premise is that the earth became forever changed when a mysterious alien battleship crashed on earth.  The people of the world, now knowing that they are not alone in the universe, end all wars and unite to understand and assimilate the advanced technology and prepare for the inevitable alien invasion that is sure to come.  As the story unfolds mankind would go on to battle three separate alien races over the next three seasons.  The sweeping intergalactic war saga itself though, merely becomes the backdrop of a more deeper ""human"" saga.
This volume chronicles adventures from the first season - The Macross Saga.  At this part in the story, the storyline is still slowly building up, intricately creating and interweaving several plotlines, while still incorporating great action and drama, all culminating in the tragic events of episode 18.  Here are the episodes featured on this DVD:
Episode 13 - Bluewind:  Vermillion Group returns to the SD-F1 with a heroes welcome.  It's a race against time as the Zentraedi renegade Khyron renews his attack.  Can they make it back to earth before Khyron destroys them?  Plus, the Zentraedi infiltrators begin their study of ""Micronian"" culture.
Episode 14- Gloval's Report:  Recap of the events till date as Gloval files his report to the Earth Government recounting the events of the past year.
Episode 15 - Homecoming:  Gloval and Lisa report to the Earth government calling for peace negotiations and receive an answer (and orders) they do not want to hear.  Plus, Rick escorts Minmei home to Japan to see her family where we're introduced to her cousin, Lynn Kyle.
Episode 16 - Battle Cry:  The citizens of Macross City become upset over their situation.  Rick is injured as Khyron attacks.  Also, more misadventures with the spies as Minmei's career skyrockets!!!
Episode 17 - Phantasm:  As his body struggles for life, Rick slips into a delirium, reliving a warped version of his past as he struggles over his feelings for the two women in his life, Lynn Minmei and Lisa Hayes.
Episode 18 - Farewell, Big Brother:  Rick recovers in the hospital while Lisa struggles with her feelings over Rick.  Ace Zentraedi pilot Miriam meets her match in Max Sterling.  The Zentraedi spies continue their study of earth culture.  Plus, tragedy befalls our heroes as one of their greatest champions goes down.
Incidentally, these volumes DO NOT have special DVD features (aside from trailer ads for other anime series coming out on DVD from ADV).  While on its own this may be considered a crime, not to fear.  If you purchase the boxed set collections, each boxed set collection will come with an ""Extra:  Elements of Robotechnology"" DVD special which will contain all the DVD special features you could want:  interviews, trailers, commercial spots, specs, etc... So by all means, get the boxed set if you are planning on buying.
I am personally very happy that ADV and Harmony Gold have finally released this series on DVD.  This is BY FAR one of my favorite cartoons from childhood.  If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture hit.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grew up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane.  Honestly, watching these episodes now I can honestly say that they are better than I remember.  You can't lose!!!

7945369,5,B00005MEUU,"Robotech was the best cartoon on TV when I was a kid.  I tried to record them but I never got home in time to catch the beginning.  The best thing they did was release these again on DVD.  I have the first 2 DVDs, just ordered the next 2, and planning on getting the rest when they are released.",997142400,2,295,3.8833333333333333

Heck, you do not even have to buy any of the other DVD`s after this part is over (except if you want to buy the Japanese version coming out at the end of the year). I know I won`t.",996969600,,254,3.9038461538461537
7945371,4,B00005MEUU,"I remember watching Robotech for the first time. I was enthralled. I loved this show not just for the cool action and mecha but the character development and plot. All top notch in my book. The animation was great for it's time but obviously will look a little dated to new viewers.  Now that I have the opportunity to collect my favourite classics on DVD this is one of my first purchases and I'll be sure to get the entire series. Hopefully they'll release all 85 episodes in succession and not make me wait too long. I've already preordered the following two collections to be released and am waiting anxiously. This DVD will contain episodes 13 through 18. ""Blue Wind"", ""Gloval's Report"", ""Home Coming"", ""Battle Cry"", ""Phantasm"" and ""Farewell, Big Brother"". Enjoy. I sure will.",995760000,,781,4.785185185185185
7945372,5,B00005MEUU,"As the battle rages on, the fight between the SDF-1 and the Zentradi continues on to Earth. The following episodes include:
Blue Wind: The SDF-1 make a break for Earth during battle.
Gloval's Report: Captain Gloval gives a report on the SDF-1's past events.
Homecoming: While Rick takes Minmei to see her parents in Japan, Lisa Hayes and Gloval give their report to the Earth Federation.
Battle Cry: When Minmei's cousin, Lynn Klye, joins the SDF-1, chaos ensues when the citizens of SDF-1 can not leave the ship. And that pails in comparisson when the Zentradi attack.
Phantasm: When Rick is downed by the Datalus attack, he dreams about Minmei and Lisa. Very confusing episode.
Goodbye Big Brother: When Rick awakes, the SDF-1 is under attack by Mirya's squadron. And one pilot will lose his life.
The only episode where the dub doesn't seem to work is Phantasm. The plot gets confusing and sometimes just stupid during that episode. The famous ""magical flying bicylce"" line included. Anyway, all the other episodes are extremely good with an exception for the flash back episode, Gloval's Report. Overall, another great volume, worth every buck.",995673600,3,1148,5.015706806282722
