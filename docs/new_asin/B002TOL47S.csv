8380381,5,B002TOL47S,"He is so smart and articulate. I love the part where he says (Not a word for word quote), ""If you are going to be religious, don't cheat at business and if you are going to cheat at business- don't call yourself religious"". Exactly right!!! He has very good common sense view, and the world would be a better place if we would follow some of the suggestions laid out in this video.",1499990400,,381,4.232876712328767
8380382,4,B002TOL47S,it was just the information I was looking for and presented very well.  I wanted to know about beliefs and daily life.,1455580800,,118,4.363636363636363

8380385,5,B002TOL47S,"The older I get,the more folks with the rabbi title,come across like the  Richard Benjamin ""rabbi"" in 'Keeping Up With the Stein's-which is why this past synagogue president pays much less attention to them than to say...a competant boxing trainer;Angelo Dundee's admonition,""you're blowing it son"" to Sugar Ray Leonard before the thirteenth round in the first Hearns fight,worked. To  paraphrase Prager,most of the talk about Judaism comes from the least knowledgeable loudmouths. The talk runs about an hour and a half(including Q&A),is an excellent basis for a rational,moderate philosophy you can take to the world and I'm fairly sure Angelo Dundee would pick up some pointers from it. More rabbi's need to pay attention.",1311552000,,725,5.350877192982456
