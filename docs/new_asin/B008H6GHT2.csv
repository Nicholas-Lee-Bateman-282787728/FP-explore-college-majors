5164408,5,B008H6GHT2,We homeschool our boys and have been looking for a fun way to explore History. These short vids are perfect even for our young teens. Jam packed with info. Watching them 2 to 3X's is beneficial as there is so much information. Can't wait to watch them all. =D,1383868800,17,259,4.3061224489795915
5164409,5,B008H6GHT2,These DVDs are awesome!  I highly recommend.  My son (and I) have learned so much.  They do a great job of presenting a big picture overview of historical events around the world.,1369785600,2,179,4.53125

5164411,1,B008H6GHT2,"I was totally disappointed with the Egyptian video.  I thought since Pipo, the character on the cover was brown, they would color the African Egyptians brown.  Then they made Pipo dumb as rocks.  I regret not sending this video back.",1467504000,2,233,4.775

5164417,4,B008H6GHT2,This holds my kids attention; it is unique in it's presentation. We haven't reached world history in our studies so I do not know how accurate overall. It's not Christian as so much more could be said in terms of Christianity. This is a primer for us and serves it's purpose.,1458345600,,275,4.411764705882353
5164418,5,B008H6GHT2,"I am trying to cover World History with my 5th and 6th grader at home.  They have had it in school a little bit, but not enough to my liking.  While this video could seem a little young with ""Pipo,"" it is a high enough level that we are learning some history without being overwhelmed.  Pipo also only makes a few appearances, and we are enjoying the other graphics that show photographs of real artifacts and maps.  This is a very nice multi-disc set.  It would be great for a long car ride!",1457308800,3,492,4.247311827956989

5164420,5,B008H6GHT2,"This is an excellent series for kids AND adults! We homeschool our four children ages 3-10, and ""Kid's Animated History with Pipo"" holds everyone's attention including the parents (THANK YOU).  We are currently studying ancient civilizations for history, in correlation with cycle 1 of Classical Conversations, and this gives life to our memory work and connects texts.  The animation isn't cheesy plus it gives the right amount humor for the whole family to enjoy! The producers kept to the historical facts, nothing controversial or biased, and they superbly illustrated it.  We aren't subscribers to Hulu where you can also view Pipo as episodes, but we found the price to be a great value. We hope there will be more Animated History with Pipo like US History or other time periods in World history. This is a ""real"" educational series that we can highly recommend!",1452297600,5,869,5.020833333333333

5164423,5,B008H6GHT2,"These are excellent! They are the definition of ""edutainment"" for kids (and adults, ahem).",1449878400,,90,5.5
5164424,5,B008H6GHT2,Perfect way to review or introduce a time in history. Fun and interesting to watch. It is also a great length - the kids don't get bored.,1449100800,,137,4.111111111111111
5164425,5,B008H6GHT2,"I am so surprised at how good this is. I got it totally not sure if it would be good or interesting. But there are 3 reasons I love it:

1.) VERY EASY TO USE
2.) COVERS ALL THE ESSENTIALS
3.) UNDOUBTEDLY ENGAGING

These are in perfectly short (10 minute?) segments, something that is perfect for car-rides.  In fact, is even more engaging and easy to use for me that our ""core"" work in Story of the World. Happily, everyone is willing to watch the same episodes, so we've been doing that to reinforce the topic as it comes up in our other studies. This would be great as an extra to school as well, not just good for homeschoolers.

We are studying Ancient History and drawing from resources all-over the board, from Classical Conversations, to Story of the World, to Library books and plenty of YouTube videos, like CrashCourse. This goes wonderfully with all of it.

I know someone said on their amazon review that this was very ""christian"" which I found ironic, and is actually the reason I am writing this review, to counteract that. It seems not Christian at all, I don't think they mention Jesus (but I could be wrong). I can guarantee it doesn't come from a Christian Worldview (I can tell by how they approach religions, and give attention to other world religions, and how it insinuates people came out of an ice-age, which is an a-typical belief for most Creationists).  But on the other hand, it isn't very anti-Christian worldview either. Like mentioned, those are the only two areas of possible concern to very ""Christian"" educators, who might be very picky about what their kids watch. I think they this is an excellent addition and you can work around those possible difficulties by just having a short dialogue, if you find something concerning.  I actually love how much they go into other cultures and their beliefs, because why else would we be studying ancient civilizations unless we expected to cover these topics? I feel like they explained various religions well. For Christians, they would probably like the Hebrew section, as it goes into the Torah (or Old Testament) within it, as that is the foundation of the Hebrew Civilization.

Also, my kids (6 and 8) love it. My son loves the sections on Spartans and Samurai warriors. My daughter just loves them in general. And I find that even I will stop listening to my audiobooks so I can listen to it when I drive. As fantasy fiction is my favorite thing and it is hard to find the time to listen-to or read, this is saying a lot. The visuals are interesting, but not so fast moving with flashing pictures, which sometimes drive me crazy about kids shows. I don't feel like my baby is going to get a seizure from watching along :) Also, I agree, Pipo himself seems pointless, but my kids like occasionally how they will see Pipo himself playing a viking video game or whatever.

The only thing I am not a fan of is that the intro is one minute everytime, which annoys me because we've already seen it a lot. And, everything can't be chronological, as each culture/civilization spans hundreds or thousands of years, and the segments are divided by civilizations rather than time-period. However, I feel they do a good job making up for it by telling us briefly what else in the world happened at that time period.",1446422400,18,3286,4.613013698630137
5164426,5,B008H6GHT2,"Not what I was expecting, but better. The kids loved it once they got into it and I loved it. Lots of awesome information given in a fun manner.",1445299200,2,144,4.0
5164427,3,B008H6GHT2,"It's cute, but some bias views.",1444780800,,31,4.333333333333333
5164428,5,B008H6GHT2,Excellent. Wish they'd take out Pipo though. He takes away from the presentation.,1442275200,,81,5.3076923076923075
5164429,5,B008H6GHT2,We found this series on Hulu but have limited internet access so we bought the dvds. Very nice set and my son really enjoys them. It's is not a cartoon but a very nice motion picture series. My son thought it was really neat.,1424304000,2,225,4.136363636363637
5164430,5,B008H6GHT2,"Beautifully animated - actually, stunningly animated - and terrific all-around history of the world for kids, a lot of stuff they skipped over when I was a kid. Some reviews have complained that it moves too fast for kids, too much info all at once. I didn't notice that. It was nicely paced for my two kids, age 5 and 8, certainly not boring. It is a lot of information, of course, and I don't expect that my kids memorized every fact, but these can be watched in short 15 minute (approx) increments, which is nice for watching again and again, perfect for my kids morning wake up routine. It took us about a month and a half to watch it all - one short episode a morning, but my kids gladly stuck with it. They've decided that the Inca's and ancient India were their favorite civilizations (Aztecs, with their human sacrifices, were on the bottom of their list!), and I learned a lot about the Persians and ancient Japan. Not easy making breakfast when I really wanted to sit on the sofa with my kids and watch this stuff, too. Highly informative, highly entertaining, highly recommended.

If I have a complaint, it's that Pipo himself is utterly lame and unnecessary - luckily, he's not in it very much so it's only a minor flaw. If they really want a mascot (I've seen many children's programs struggle with finding a decent mascot, even when they don't need one), how about a famous historical figure? a famous historian like Herodotus? Someone from the future looking back at history? or a whole classroom of bright inquisitive kids instead of one who talks like Goofy? Again, I don't mean to emphasize it. A very minor flaw.

Will be looking for more productions like this - informative, intelligent, and visually captivating - but, sadly, they're few and far between. Would love this company to put out more. Stuff like this is lacking. How about a program on the American Presidents, or world leaders, World War 1 or 2, types of governments, philosophers? So much I'd love to see - just glad I happened upon this one (try Liberty's Kids as well, btw, if you're looking for first rate history programs for kids).

PS: If you want to check it out before you purchase, to make sure it's right for your kids, they have an example posted on youtube (a bit of the Japan episode, if I remember right): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVJ-6wSnl7M",1424304000,15,2347,4.650602409638554

5164432,5,B008H6GHT2,I've only so far had a chance to see the Ancient Egypt section of this DVD and it was great! I used it in my classroom to introduce Ancient Egypt history to second grade students and they really enjoyed it. Very information but not to long so they don't lose interest. I'm looking forward to watching the rest some other time.,1420675200,,326,4.360655737704918
5164433,4,B008H6GHT2,"Good video series, one reviewer stated this is from a Christian perspective, it is not.  Even so, it is a good overview and interesting even for young children.  A good video for in the car or on burn out days.",1419897600,,210,4.225

5164435,5,B008H6GHT2,What a wonderful product.  My 7-year-old nephew absolutely loves it.  It is always one of the first things he asks for every time he visits me.  Very educational and engaging.  I only wish they made more!!,1417305600,,205,4.611111111111111
5164436,5,B008H6GHT2,"This is a fantastic concept.  I really expected a cartoon version of history, so was unpleasantly surprised when we popped the dvd in and got a narrator over barely-animated ""slides"".  I thought we'd hate the series, but kept at it with my ten-year-old and ended up really liking it.  Once you get used to the format, it actually makes a lot of sense, and each of the six dvds is packed with information.  There are sixteen cultures covered -- each divided into two sections of about eleven minutes each.  The information comes fast, so don't blink or you'll miss something really important!  I dislike the long introductory graphic, and was annoyed that each ""part one"" had a preview of ""part two"", and then ""part two"" usually had more than a minute of recap.  These sections are only eleven minutes long, so it makes no sense to me why you need previews and recaps that eat up so much of the time.  That being said, they are very well-done.  The animation is sort of like Gumby-goes-paperdoll, but it works.  And sometimes they set up a situation like a video game, which ends up illustrating their point well.  Someone mentioned that the series is very Christian, but after watching all the dvds, I really disagree.  Since religion pretty much drove history, it is covered in every culture.  Each religion is presented from the standpoint of its truth, and they do it in a way that is educational and (I would think) non-offensive to any of the other religions.  They also spend time during each segment exploring what else was happening in the world at the time of whatever they were just teaching about.  There are, in fact, naked stone statues, as well as joking references to aliens, which are specifically not disputed.  It's also relevant that leaders of many cultures had multiple wives, and when it is casually mentioned, the character often raises his eyebrows in delight.  These things might make the series feel inappropriate for some families, but for us it was an excellent way to gently introduce these concepts to my ten-year-old (some she already knew, but a few she didn't), in a way that made discussion of the issues totally effortless.  A family that may want to specifically teach against these things would have an easy time comparing the cultural issue to their moral code.  This set covers things like war, animal and human sacrifice, and harems in a way that I would feel comfortable with with kids as young as eight (possibly younger for some kids), but I do think the subject matter is best geared toward older kids and adults who want a refresher course, or who just need to finally put their forgotten pieces of history together in context.  I highly recommend watching this with the younger kids (my daughter just finished fourth grade and was the perfect age) so that you're there to address their running commentary, and starting with disc one instead of bouncing around.",1400716800,55,2906,4.7624750499002
5164437,3,B008H6GHT2,They don't just play continuously.  Every 15 minutes or so a segment ends and you have to choose which scene to go to next.  Would have been great if it just played on.,1396224000,3,168,4.0606060606060606

5164439,5,B008H6GHT2,"These are interesting for all ages, engaging, informative.  They are very Christian though so be aware of that aspect.  I don't find that offense, but some will of course.

Also- we were not offended by any of the ""religious"" topics covered in any of the videos.  History is history and there have been opposing views then and are now.  These videos do not go in depth enough in my opinion to cause any concern.",1471737600,,546,4.454545454545454
