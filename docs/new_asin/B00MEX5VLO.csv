6575791,4,B00MEX5VLO,"Great story following up on season 1.  Life in El Paso, Texas with its  characters that are all slightly over the edge. Thin line between cop and criminal at times they go back and forth. The life in Juarez creeps over into El Paso and keeps the audience on the edge. Not your everyday cop show very unpredictable keeps interest at a high pace. All characters in the show are far from the norm which makes it very griping and interesting.  One of a handful of shows that I can binge watch. The tiny female cop is a very captivating character that is played very well. Having been to Juarez  back in the early1970's  it re enforces a strong feeling to never return.",1424131200,,664,4.365853658536586

6575798,5,B00MEX5VLO,"If you're a highly astute and critical viewer you can find things in every episode which don't quite make sense. Nevertheless, this was a really good series and a lot of fun to watch. I grew to care about the characters; perhaps because most were neither all good nor all bad. They were shades of gray and exhibited human flaws. This made them all the more real and believable to me.

Minor Spoiler Alert *** For example, the ""good guys"" capture a corrupt Mexican cop with a history of rape and murder. So what do they do? Brutally torture him for information and then kill him. Not really what good guys do.

I was a little disappointed that in Season 2 Sonya's asperger's syndrome seemed to clear up. In Season 1 it made her a more interesting character, watching her struggle with social awkwardness, grasping to find the right words and display the right emotions.",1438128000,3,868,4.593548387096774
6575799,1,B00MEX5VLO,"Ugly, dark full of cheaters, lies and killers.  The only good charter, as first, was the gorgeous Mexican cop, but he cheats on his pregnant wife!  The female American cop goes to a bar to pick up a man for sex.  She picks him up in less than three minutes.  What women in a normal sane world takes a strange man she's know for less than 3 minutes to her house to have sex?  Didn't she see Looking For Mr. Goodbar?

6575817,5,B00MEX5VLO,"Season One was excellent so I expected nothing less in Season Two, and it delivered in spades. The focus is more on the drug trade this time so it made for a more lively sociopolitical subplot behind all the crimes investigated. The relationships also get crazy wonky this season especially between Hank and Sonya as well as the usual Sonya and Marco. Franka Potente (she's the woman Matt Damon protects in the Bourne Identity movie) joins the cast as a fixer for Fausto Galvan's cartel. She is creepier than any character ever introduced in this series, and just freaks me out every time she does anything onscreen.

The DVD extras are superb. There are three-minute Behind The Bridge segments for each episode which focus on one aspect of each episode and don't necessarily mean the actors or directors are the interviewees. We get to hear from stunt people, writers, consultants, etc.

Sadly, this is the last season of the series as FX canceled it. So savour this DVD box set.",1431475200,,980,4.758823529411765

6575844,5,B00MEX5VLO,"Season 2 of The Bridge is at least the equal of season 1.  While the focus of season 1 is the solving of a particular murder case, the focus of season 2 is Faustos cartel and its reach within the U.S., from local banks and money launderers to the higher reaches of significant government agencies.

It begins with Lyle Lovett as lawyer Monte Flagman walking into what appears to be the model home in an upper middle class subdivision.  He is decked out in his full regalialarge Stetson, designer cowboy boots, etc.  As he enters the house the floor is covered in blood, literally, covered . . . in . . . blood.  The set designers used approximately 80% of a large steel barrel of the stuff.  As Monte walks across the floor he has difficulty maintaining his footing.  He slips and slides as he discovers the aftermath of an apocalyptic shootout.

What happened?  Approximately three-quarters of season 2 then proceeds to tell us, as the backstory is explored.  Fausto is under fire; a putatively upstanding industrialist (played by Demian Bichirs brother, Bruno) is seeking to supplant him.  In between the two of them is a fascinating character named Eleanor Nacht.  Eleanor dresses in quasi-Amish clothing, clutches a ledger, and manages all of the financial infrastructure of the cartel.  She claims to be an independent operator.  Will she remain loyal to Fausto or work for his rival, Sebastian Cerisola?

The Charlotte/Ray subplot takes on less importance in season 2, the principal arcs being those of Sonya/Hank/Marco/Eleanor/Fausto, with the Frye/Mendez investigative journalism and the Linder/Eva love/revenge stories close seconds.  After the bloodbath is explained we move from climax to denouement.  The multiple endings are extremely satisfying as each of the plot arcs are, more or less, resolved.

As in season 1, the production values are very high, the direction superb, the scripts strong, the acting consistently excellent.  The only warning concerns the level of violence, some of which is quite explicit.  It does not verge on pornographic violence, but this is a story about a drug cartel.  They don't play beanbag.

My only regret is that, like the great Damian Lewis series, Life, the show will not (at least for now) return for a third season.  Enjoy it while you can.  This is exceptional adult television programming.",1424995200,5,2345,5.015544041450777
6575845,4,B00MEX5VLO,"Warning, this review discusses some of the plot points of season 1, and gives hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.

This season is a little bittersweet in that it ties up many storylines that were established in season one after the serial killer story was concluded, but, because FX canceled the show after they finished the season, we are never given a true sense of finality because the season finale was really setting up a feeling of ""what's next""  and did leave some things open.

Season two follows up the corrupt police story from the second half of season one, and expands it.  In fact all the main character's stories intersect the overall arch which has to do with the corrupt police, the Fausto Galvan cartel, the DEA and CIA.  The El Paso police are looking at it from one angle, the reporters are looking at it from the other, Marco is smack in the middle, and the other characters like Linder and Charlotte Millwright are on the outskirts being drawn in.

We also learn more this season about what happened to Sonya's sister, as Sonya beings a relationship with the brother of the man who murdered her sister.  In that, more about Hank's role in the story comes to light and causes conflict between Hank and Sonya.  This season also introduces the character of Elanor Nacht as the main villain.  Much of the season is focused on who she is, what her motivations are, and Sonya's quest to stop her.

The season also jumps around in time telling the story.  In fact the very opening sequence shows the aftermath of events that occur in one of the last few episodes.  It is not extremely hard to follow, but you do need to pay attention or you may get lost trying to figure everything out.  The season does a good job of having Marco continue to walk a fine line between getting involved and being complicit in the corruption that is all around him, and doing the right thing.  Likewise, Sonya is forced to abandon seeing things as black or white and nothing else.  There is not as much Sonya/Marco interaction this season as there was in season 1, but what is there is very good.

For those who get the DVDs, for extras there are short features for every episode that give a behind the scenes look at that particular episode.  On the final disc there are some deleted scenes and a season 2 wrap up.  Not a ton of material, but good for what is there.  The one drawback was the studio being cheap and not releasing the season on blu ray.  This of course has been the case with a lot of shows that are not extremely popular and/or not special effects heavy.

As I said before this season is kind of bittersweet.  Although we do get resolutions to some of the stories, there is never a sense of a wrap up to the series.  It is clear if you watch the season wrap up that the show runners were planning on a third season and setting the tone for what that was going to be.  That said there was no big season ending cliff hanger where you are left to wonder of someone lived or died, so there is no leaving the audience twisting going on, you are just really left to wonder what happens next for the various people involved.

If you were a fan of season 1, especially the later part of the season, and can live with not getting a blu ray version this is still worth picking up if you want the actual discs.  Otherwise, it is something that is worth streaming online.",1424563200,6,3381,4.386837881219904
8671906,4,B00MEX5VLO,"I give it only 4 Stars because of male caretakers weekness as portrayed in the series. I know it's because of the excellent work of Demain Bichir in portraying Detective Ruiz that I feel this and I wouldn't change his betrayal of thischaracter. Ruiz just isn't someone I'd to have around my family. Cross on the other hand would provide consistency. Yes, it actually was a five star performance. I just couldn't allow myself to give it all 5.

8671908,5,B00MEX5VLO,"The Tunnel, is a riff from The Bridge in both Scandanavian and English versions. Truth be told I like The Tunnel better. The Bridge was the forerunner, and brought the interacting of two separate police departments working together. In all three versions the separate detectives are wary of one another, each having their own personality and their own method of police work. But when they work together, like a marriage, the work is better.

The Tunnel brings Karl, a Brit played by Stephen Dillane. He is on his third marriage, after cheating on each wife, has 5 children by different women, is looking for fun and love to ease the stress of his job. But in reality his life has been his job until he comes face to face with losing his family. The French side of the connection, Elise, is played by Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy. She is blunt, an attractive blonde, has no social graces, but is brilliant at her job. They are both involved in looking for a serial killer who has left the top half of a British body connected to the bottom half of a French body, placed smack dab in the middle of The Chunnel, the underwater tunnel that connects France and England. This is the beginning of a long stretch to find the killer known as Truth Terrorist.

We meet many characters, and as the days drag on the media, teens, old military, pensioners, financial people and the police are all a part of the circle of deaths. The writing is terrific, the acting is better, the scenes between France and England gorgeous. The Tunnel all boils down to the two detectives, their relationships with others and between themselves. High tension ensues, trying to outwit the Truth Terrorist, and bring him to justice without too many bodies along the way. Loved the two main characters, and their relationship. Looking forward to Part III.
