1038365,5,6305460167,"I just saw this movie and I was very impressed by the genre of bank robbers. I was very happy on one hand that the movie took a ""gay theme"" swing and it was a movie that didn't involve AIDS and people dying. On the other hand it took a negative swing because it didn't give a very good portrayal of gay relationships either.  To be honest here, if it had been a ""straight"" couple with the relationship being the way that it was portrayed, I would not have thought anything about it. I would have thought that it is like any other unhealthy relationship that is out there. No, but it was portrayed as a ""gay"" relationship so I can see where it disturbed me and probably others as well. I and others have to come to realization that all relationships can be unhealthy. They don't have to be ""straight or gay"" to be unhealthy. Also, they are bank robbers for petes sake. There is something wrong with them as people (gay or straight) anyway if they are robbing banks. There is one thing that I will say about this ""gay themed"" portrayal, the robbers are not queeny or flamboyant giving a ""weak"" view of gay men. So to me, that was a positive thing. I do recommend this movie that wants something different and not your ""run of the mill"" gay movie.",1164585600,2,1244,4.316239316239316
1038366,3,6305460167,"This movie takes place in Caledonia Minnesota, not Wisconsin like is written on the box.  That was an error on the studio's part.  As a citizen of Caledonia Minnesota and a fan of this film, I just thought I should clear that up.",1104883200,2,229,4.3023255813953485
1038367,4,6305460167,"FALL TIME is an interesting and different movie, at times implausible, but infused with a sense of loss and despair.  The three boys who play the teenagers do a commendable job:  Jason London as the educated, uppity-at-times Tim; David Arquette as the prankster in charge David; and Jonah Bleckman as the put-upon Joe.  Their latest prank proves to be their last as they cross paths with two homosexual bank robbers.  The homosexual theme is underplayed and much innuendo abounds, but there's a sincerity to their relationship that makes it believable.  Stephen Baldwin and Mickey Rourke play the robbers.  Baldwin is especially good in his role as Leon, a somewhat nebbish, but at the same time, innocently youthful killer.  It's a good performance from the Baldwin brother.  Rourke, as always, knows how to play sleaze.  His Rusty/Florence (great name, huh) is cold, deceitful and manipulative.  TWIN PEAKS' Sheryl Lee is both downhome homely but covertly sensual in her role as the kidnapped bank teller or loan officer.  There's more than meets the eye,however, with this one.  Country crooner Sammy Kershaw also shows up for a brief performance as the deputy.

Paul Warner's direction keeps the atmosphere tense, and with a disturbing sense of doom, which he maintains throughout the movie.  The home videos are particularly effective in establishing some of the characters and their motivations.

I liked this film, and think it bears witness to see how some of the unknowns then have blossomed into their present day careers.",1091232000,11,1532,5.120967741935484
1038368,3,6305460167,"The best thing about Fall Time is watching actors  in their ""before they were stars"" period. Baldwin and Arquette are good in their roles.  Baldwin particulaly impressed me the most showing that he was a talent to  be seen and later enjoyed in such movies as Hula Moon.  Rourke is equally  fine and proves once again that he is the most natural and gifted actor of  his generation.  No one can show greater inner pain than Rourke",953251200,3,429,4.4935064935064934

When they get there, it turns out that there are some real bank robbers (Rourke and Stephen Baldwin) who are going after the same bank and end up forcing the boys to help them.  A childish bank has turned out to be a violent and tragic reality.  It's a movie that keeps you captivated throughout and finishes with a surprising twist at the end.

This horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank-robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing (and torture) to last me for the rest of my life.
