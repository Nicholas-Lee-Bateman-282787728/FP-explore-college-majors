7986863,3,B00008T7FI,"I don't know what movie many of the other reviewers (NY Times, IMBD, etc.) of this film saw, but I certainly disagree that Luci set out to seduce every member of the family.  She seemed to me to be an extremely insecure teen, extremely neurotic, and that she was behaving strangely because of her own inner demons.  Any sexual acting out came from trying to cope with her anxieties and not from any conscious or diabolical means.  If Luci was clingy, it was because she was desperately trying to find some real love in her life.  Unfortunately for those type of people, they drive away the very love they crave . . . unless those in authority over her are extremely understanding and even trained to cope with such anxiety.  Fear is being afraid of something external to you; anxiety is irrationally being afraid of things that exist only in one's mind.

Almost everyone encounters a person such as Luci at some point in their life.  While the circumstances are very different, the German movie ""Forest for the Trees"" is also about a young woman who is so desperate for friends she manages to drive everyone away from her.  Parents may want to show this movie to teens who've encountered such a person and discuss how it would be best to handle the situation, both lovingly and yet without letting the person control their life.  I would warn that there are a few nude scenes with Luci, but (at least in my opinion) they are not particularly offensive.",1202601600,7,1452,4.596899224806202
