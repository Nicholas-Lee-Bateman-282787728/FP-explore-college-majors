2047323,5,B0001Z935C,"I love the Brainy Baby series.  My girls really love it to.  This is a very fun one that shows all types of emotions.  My girls are just 13 months, so I am sure they don't really know what is going on, but it does keep their attention and they do enjoy it.  We also own Left Brain and it keeps their attention as well.  I may not fully understand what they love about it so much, but I love the fact that they are learning while having a good time.",1167264000,4,448,3.879120879120879
2047324,5,B0001Z935C,"My child is 14 months and has been watching this for a few days. Now this is her absolute favorite! She laughs, dances, and repeats the many words and objects displayed throughout the show.

She has Brainy Baby Left and Right Brain, English, Art, and a few Baby Einstein DVDs, but this has truly kept her attention. Her favorite part is the underwater adventure with all the colorful fish and the silly faces the children make.

I always interact with her when she watches these shows and we both have lots of fun with this one! I more than satisfied with this one and look forward to purchasing more Brainy Baby DVDs.",1167264000,10,618,4.508928571428571
2047325,3,B0001Z935C,"Our daughter (20 months) will sit and watch it, but she doesn't enjoy it as much as the Baby Einstein DVD's. It is more overtly educational than BE, so she may enjoy more when she is a little older and she understands a little more.",1124236800,6,232,4.177777777777778
2047326,5,B0001Z935C,"I started putting the Laugh & Learn movie when my son was 20 months old. I would even put the movie in the car DVD when we would go out for drives or road trips. It caught his attention immediately. He would repeat everything they would say, whether it was the alphabet, numbers, colors and even the shapes/opposites. He started singing his alphabet as of 21 months and he just gets better and better. He is now 24 months and he still loves this movie. It is much more educational than the Baby Einstein series. The best movie yet.",1121731200,13,531,4.373737373737374
2047327,4,B0001Z935C,"The Brainy Baby Right Brain is the first of the Brainy Baby series I bought. Then I came across Laugh and Learn and decided to give it a try.

It starts with different babies wearing silly masks and making funny faces. Then goes on about colors, shapes, matching, guessing game, 'yes' or 'no', alphabets and numbers.

The DVD is long - so it is advisible to watch it with the baby (if you can) and try to repeat what was said (usually 'yes', 'no', names of colors, etc.).

It is too long in one sitting, but I admit I usually just let it play. Baby will do something else after a long while, but periodically go back to the front of the TV and see what the chuckles are all about.

I recommend Brainy Baby series. I have bought a few others well in advance of my baby's learning, but I am sure it will be handy when he gets older.

The bonus material includes a story telling board, Baby Bloopers, and music video. Quite a lot of material packed into one DVD.

This is suitable only for older babies (10 months +++).",1100649600,50,1016,4.238341968911917
2047328,5,B0001Z935C,"My son really likes Brainy Baby videos, the animation keeps his attention and he repsonds to what is going on on the screen.

Lots of basics are covered to help learning begin, numbers, letters and songs and he is mimicing/understanding some of the things during repeated viewings.

Always good for a short break during the day for entertainment.  Well done.",1263859200,,358,4.933333333333334
2047329,4,B0001Z935C,The video kept him entertained in its entire run....It has helped especially when I have to prepare dinner and to help calm him down when he is fussy. The video has multiple segments that interests him. I have the other Brainy Baby videos but so far he likes this the best. He started doing the hand motions for Itsy Bitsy Spider song after repeated viewing.,1262995200,,358,4.523076923076923
2047330,5,B0001Z935C,"The video seems to be very good for a child a little older, my daughter is only 3 months and she dosent watch it intently as she does left brain and right brain, I think this is too advance for her, but I know it will benefit her once she gets older. It was a good buy you cant go wrong.",1250035200,,287,3.721311475409836
2047331,5,B0001Z935C,"This was shipped quick. Our son isn't quite old enough for it, but he loves watching the other children and babies. We don't want the t.v. to be his babysitter, but it comes in handy when my child's restless and I have chores to do around the house.
The video usually puts him in a better mood, and he even fallen asleep while watching. We bought one other B.B. vid, and plan to buy more.",1242172800,,388,4.1866666666666665
2047332,5,B0001Z935C,"Great product. Great delivery. My 1 year old daughter enjoys this video. She watches it as she begins her nap and and bedtime. She knows her nose, feet, hands, and mouth. I love they way she enjoys laying and watching the dvd. I thought she had to have the ""Your Baby Can Read"" by Dr. Titzer in order for her to begin early learning. But, she did not. This cd is just as good but less affordable. It is enjoyable for her and impressive to me. It is not boring. It has lots of live babies, they spell out the alphabet, count numbers, show parts of the body and so forth. She has even begun to say words like please and our names. My husband and I love the way she is progressing and plan to buy more.",1234656000,4,699,4.072463768115942

2047334,5,B0001Z935C,"I also have the Brainy Baby Peek-a-boo video and I love them both.  My 18 month old grandson loves these videos and I highly recommend them.  They are fun, funny, and educational.",1219536000,,179,4.5625

2047336,5,B0001Z935C,My daugther completely blank out her envirnment as brainy baby comes on. This product is exceptionally productive. MY 2 year old can say her abc's her numbers shapes and even sing nursery rhyms.,1190332800,3,194,4.909090909090909
2047337,4,B0001Z935C,"I gave this 4 stars simply because it's a Brainy Baby DVD and I expect to love it as much as I do others when my son gets a little older. My 13mos old son absolutely loves and is oddly mesmorized by the Brainy Baby - Right Brain, but this one he didn't seem to be too interested in after about 10 minutes. I still love the Brainy Baby line and will try him again with it when he is a few months older.",1172102400,3,401,3.7857142857142856

8019033,5,B0001Z935C,"What a great little video. My son used to watch this when he was 2 and he really learned his ABC's well he is now 4 and the preschool he goes to does a letter a week and I noticed that he was having trouble identifying the alphabet... Hmmm this didn't make me happy. so back to home work time with Mom and Dad. We draw and trace the letters every night now and he gets to watch this video too. It is really cool because they have a segment where the alphabet is made out of wooden letters and made to look like a train, so each train letter scrolls across the TV screen and a FUN voice says....A,B,C. Then they string the letters together to make simple words like Car, Dog and others.
They have other segments in the video too and what is so great is that they have 2-5 year olds doing the segments and everyone knows kids love to mimic the bigger kids. My son is mesmerized  by the other kids and doesn't even realize he is learning.

Anyway, I would recommend this video to anyone trying to teach their kids the ABC's",1391126400,,1020,4.146464646464646

grandson and thought I would just up date with the CD.  But the content had changed a little  (I was a little
disappointed)  But my grandson Loves It  and that is who its for....",1383264000,,285,4.017857142857143
8019035,1,B0001Z935C,"Wow. Dad, Mom, Baby, none of us can get interested in this video.
We bought this to try and help encourage talking, but not only doesn't it do that, it doesn't even hold anyone's attention.
If you like watching a mom sing off-key to her child because you can't be bothered to sing to your child yourself, then maybe this is for you.
Save your money for Baby Babble dvds instead.",1289088000,,378,4.338028169014085
8019036,5,B0001Z935C,This DVD is highly recommended for the little ones. My daughter lives to watch and learn while laughing too. Seeing other kids on tv keeps her interested :),1273795200,,156,4.607142857142857
8019037,5,B0001Z935C,"I now have all the Brainy Baby Dvd's. I love them as does my 4 month old son. He watches them every day, laughs and smiles with them. I think this one is his favorite out of all though.",1269820800,2,185,3.769230769230769

8019039,2,B0001Z935C,"It doesn't keep the attention of my 2 year old, although I know every child is different.

I also purchased the ""LET'S TALK WITH PUPPY DOG"" series for him when he was much younger.  He loved the baby phonics.  Once he could say all the words, I put another of the 7 dvds on for him.  He can watch it... LITERALLY, for 4 hours straight if you let him!!!!
(It's annoying to the parent, but he is really learning.  His colors, letters and words are getting clearer)",1265155200,,462,4.264367816091954
