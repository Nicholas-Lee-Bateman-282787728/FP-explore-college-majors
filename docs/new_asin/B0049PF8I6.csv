8419177,3,B0049PF8I6,Not as interesting or informative as I'd hoped. Definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it. Would be better priced at $19.99 or less.,1435104000,,133,4.36

8419180,5,B0049PF8I6,"I'm new at creating abstract paintings and I was fascinated to watch the various ways she develops the same basic under-layer shapes, developing the painting in different ways. I am going to watch this again and try some of the techniques. Good comments along the way, and the audience asks some good questions she clarifies. Good for newbies like me.",1400803200,3,351,4.866666666666666
8419181,5,B0049PF8I6,"Virginia Cobb is a clear and inspiring teacher, who can really point out common obvious mistakes in the artistic process. I know I'll watch this video again and benefit from it!!",1370131200,,178,4.774193548387097
8419182,5,B0049PF8I6,"When I purchased Virginia Cobb's DVD on abstract painting from Amazon I didn't realize it would be so inspiring and amazing to watch. In this DVD you see Virginia Cobb prepare the structure of a painting with an underpainting but then she proceeds to (partly) destroy this structure as she follows her instinct and feeling. Then she rebuilds it in a different way. It's like an organic process.
What I wasn't expecting was how liberating her attitude to painting would be for me. On top of showing how she proceeds, Virginia Cobb gives some very helpful advice for anyone trying to paint in an abstract way.",1342483200,11,607,4.735849056603773
