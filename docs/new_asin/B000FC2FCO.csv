2560588,4,B000FC2FCO,This is a highly intellectual series of documenteries showing a great deal of scientists theories and counter theories regarding UFOs and other sightings. The viewer needs more than a 30 second MTV attention level to understand whats going on. Slow down and pay attention to the details! Listening is the key word to this set. There is a tremendous amount of information here!,1189468800,,376,4.984126984126984
2560589,1,B000FC2FCO,"Do not waste your money on this two-bit slam against any legitimate investigation into UFOs. Although it occassionally presents a few respected scientists and dedicated investigators, it quickly dismisses their statements and resorts to wholly unfounded skepticism discounting all as cranks, hoaxers, and even mentally ill cultists. This includes Project Blue Book's Dr. Hynek and many other highly respectable authors and scientists who are pegged as idiots. Just who is behind this release of hogwash and why they feel it necessary to attempt to dissuade the public from taking UFOs seriously is the real question. But you will not get any clues from this cheapo trashy production.  I cannot even bear to bother with finishing watching the entire set of five discs. It is dull and repetitive tripe.  Much like a Nightly News War on Terror propaganda piece.",1151971200,16,858,5.2101449275362315
2560590,5,B000FC2FCO,"Here's recommendation #1.

Though I don't have a lot of interested in UFO phenomenon, being almost militantly skeptical on the subject, the box for The Alien Files looked interesting enough for me to pick up.  On closer examination I saw the ""Madacy Home Video"" label and started to have doubts.  Madacy is one of those companies that, from time to time, bundles poor-quality public-domain titles together.  And I'd never heard of this series.  The cover had few details.  Still, the package looked slick, and I found a good deal on it, so I snatched it up.  I figured that it would annoy me, give me a headache with its banality, or be way out in left field and childishly credulous.  So many of those UFO documentaries I see on television, if not intolerably dry and inconsequential, are like ""There might be extraterrestrials zipping around in flying saucers!  Isn't that cool?""  This series really defied my expectations.  I am truly impressed.  Mind you, some will find it all to be much too talky.  The Alien Files is almost free of the expected cheesy reenactments with idealized actors (or, worse, un-idealized non-actors) and crude CGI spacecraft.  There isn't the oily, off-putting, UFO-nut slant to it, either.  In fact, the phenomenon is scrutinized in quite a sober, skeptical manner.  The camerawork and special effects aren't flashy.  It doesn't gaily browse through Roswell souvenir shops, or interview Hollywood special-effects experts or professional trekkies to give color to their presentation.  Instead, The Alien Files spends almost all it's time talking to physicists, scientific investigators and other solid authorities who pick apart cases one by one in ten different episodes covering the various aspects of Ufology.  It isn't padded out with the all-too-familiar film-clips you see in other UFO documentaries, and it doesn't waste much time with cases that simply aren't to be taken seriously.  The series seeks a scientific framework for the phenomenon, rather than to simply debunk it.  But again, it is mostly just a lot of old guys talking, so if you were expecting ten-hour commercial for the X-Files, be forewarned.",1150156800,11,2149,5.117816091954023
2560591,1,B000FC2FCO,"The information presented is badly slanted. The final conclusion of each segment always seems to be that there's really nothing in it. Several times, statements are made that there is no evidence to support a particular point of view when the truth is that a vast field of evidence is simply being ignored.

One example from the section on crop circles: Their ""expert"" states outright that crop circles would be interesting if there were some evidence that they were not made by humans stepping on the plants. If the stalks were broken off above ground level for example...well, quite a lot of circles are composed entirely of plants that are broken off several inches above the ground, and in fact are not so much broken as exploded out from their center. I'd like to know how a couple of guys with boards and ropes can do that. They can't explain it, so they just don't mention it.

If you want any good, accurate information on what's actually happening in the world, don't bother with this production.",1236556800,4,1005,4.704545454545454
2560592,3,B000FC2FCO,"I watched *all 13 volumes of this series and all 13 volumes focus stricltly on debunking the UFO phenomena. They go out of their way to discredit some of the better known UFO cases. In some instances this was well deserved. In other instances, there are well documented cases and information that is convieniently ommited. The producers of this series are all too willing too accept the explanations of the military and the skeptical scientific community too readily. Some skeptisism is healthy and good, but I found it to be a little too one sided in this particular instance. Skeptics will probably find a lot too like here. Students of the UFO phenomenen will most likely not be impressed. When I see scientists talking about the rest of life in the intelligent universe as if everything were on a *level playing field with whatever the current state of human technology is, I just have to laugh. I'm pretty *certain they're not bound by the rules of *our scientific community. I'm also certain it will be proven to be a *fact within the next few years............",1233360000,,1067,4.772972972972973
2560593,1,B000FC2FCO,"That depends on what your looking for. This is 10rs long, in 1hr parts.
What the Collection does is , make fun of UFO believers, plain and simple.
1st they place a UFO believer on, and he talks about his story with goofy music in the background, then they place a debunker on with serious music in the background and then they even have the narrator explains how foolish UFO believers are. To me, its not taken seriously enough. If you want to make a documentary about hating , debunking, or making fun of UFO believers then at least make that known with the title. Something like , UFO Nuts! or UFOs are fake! Or even Debunking UFOs! Lets us all know your against them before we buy it. I gave it 1 star because of the fact it wasn't taken seriously at all.

2560595,1,B000FC2FCO,"I fell asleep 15 minutes into this DVD set and haven't watched it since. After reading these other reviews I don't regret that nap one bit, and my copy is now sitting at the bottom of the canal behind my house.",1208908800,,210,4.146341463414634
2560596,3,B000FC2FCO,"I bought this on a whim, and it came in a nifty 3-D tin box.  I figured, if the documentary wasn't that great the box was pretty cool.

This documentary is geared toward debunking (overall), but it should be interesting for those who ""Want to Believe,"" as well.  The series begins as a seemingly in favor of (the existence of UFOs) documentary, but my overall impression is that it subconsciously deters folks from believing in extraterrestrials.  Regardless, both sides are presented, and you can decide for yourself.

I've watched a lot of specials and movies about this subject, and this one is different.  It is worth watching (in stages), if you can deal with the repetitive scenes and ""look, he is Pondering, deeply...."" replays.  Personally, I think this is subtle propaganda against believing in E.T.s, but it is still interesting.  Always beneficial to look at ALL side of an issue.

Then turn the TV off, and go outside.  Decide for yourself.  But, be careful, since Uncle Sam monitors UFO watchers....for whatever reason.  E.T.s or Uncle Sammies, whatever they are this documentary series looks at both sides of the debate and has some information that I have not seen, previously.",1206316800,8,1192,4.934673366834171
2560597,3,B000FC2FCO,"I ordered this box set and it was in a tin box, and I decided to watch it. I was interested in the UFO phenomenon and I haven't really ordered any DVDs about them and the only book I had was Alien Agenda by Jim Marrs that I didn't finish reading. After watching two DVDs, I regret my purchase. Here are the reasons.

1.) Almost everyone interviewed are speaking French and are dubbed by a very uninteresting voice.
2.) The DVDs are filled with uninteresting facts.. such as if anyone are faking to be real religious leaders or not.. not much on the UFO phenomenon.
3.) The host is obviously a disbeliever.

This DVD set is very uninteresting, and although UFOlogists who are interviewed seem to know what they are doing, they don't express it in the right words. I recommend you to purchase a DVD set by the History Channel and not by anyone unpopular like the ones who made The Alien Files: UFOs Under Investigation. If you want to buy this, go right ahead. I did so and I regret it, but it's only a few bucks spent.",1205884800,,1017,4.347368421052631
2560598,4,B000FC2FCO,"When I first sat down to watch this set,not knowing it was not
a U.S. production, it initially came off as ok this is going to be
tongue in cheek frivolity.  This guy driving in his car with a flying
disc hanging from mirror & then a crackpot photographer trying to stage
a ufo hoax with a string & blowing smoke around it for effect. As I
forced myself to continue watching I found that I was getting alot of
detailed info from very astute ufo investigators that previously I was not
privy to. I enjoyed hearing from investigators outside of the U.S. & U.K.  You have to be able to focus on the detailed information being
given to really enjoy this series of documentaries. If you are someone
who watches for the ufo footage & not so much for the information being
given,this video is probably not for you. People with limited attention spans will probably find this tedious.
  What I enjoyed was the even handed approach given by the producers of this video. I was surprised  most by the even handedness of the ufo investigators themselves & the truly  in depth scientific approach taken on this subject.",1200182400,4,1106,4.532663316582915
2560599,1,B000FC2FCO,"This is the most tedious and boring UFO series I have ever seen. It's mainly just talking heads discussing agencies and policies. Mainly from France, Montreal or Ontario.

If you want a history of agencies and sightings, get the book ""Alien Agenda"" by Jim Marrs which is very detailed and specific, possibly the most comprehensive book on UFOs ever written. ""The Physics of Star Trek"" is an excellent book explaining the near impossibility of interstellar flight.

But a visual medium like a DVD series should have a lot more visual information like a multitude of films and photos of unexplained craft.

I think it is a Canadian production, so maybe the pacing is just very slow compared to what I'm used to. If you ge it at $7 used you might not complain. But even at the $20 I paid, it is a waste of money being almost unwatchable.

Granted, this may be the largest collection of talking heads sitting around discussing UFOs, so if that sounds exciting, pick it up. 5 discs of pedantic nonsense is hardly what I call intellectual, though. It is a waste of film. The metal box it came in is cool, but that's about all there is in favor of it.

This is the most boring series on UFOs ever made. Like another reviewer said, it's hard to even watch the whole thing because it's so slow and repetitive.",1199577600,,1300,4.514893617021277
2560600,2,B000FC2FCO,"This DVD set is very deceiving.  When you look at in the store it looks really cool.  But when you get it home and start to watch, it starts to seem like you've wasted your money.

After you get past the eye candy the tin packaging and artwork have to offer, you realize the DVDs are very unprofessional.  Madacy tries to cram too much video onto single-layer DVDs.  Therefore the video is too often compressed resulting in poor picture quality especially on the bonus features.  This is problem #1.

The program itself appears to be a miniseries aired on Canadian television.  Being Canadian in nature, half of the people speak French which normally wouldn't bother me but they have employed very boring voice-over talent and narrator.  It has very little dealing with aliens despite what the artwork conveys.  90% of the content is about lame goverment agencies and projects investigating UFOs.

There aren't enough well-known members of the UFO community featured.  Most of the people interviewed are extremely borish as well.  It's so difficult to sit and watch, it almost feels like homework after a while.  If you are looking for interesting stuff you see on the History Channel or Discovery just keep looking because this isn't the answer.

I give it 2 stars simply because of the packaging and it looks nice on my DVD rack.  The rest is a waste of time unless you are a hardcore UFO fanatic.  I'd rather pay good money for a serious product with better production.",1196640000,,1472,4.75494071146245

8120709,5,B000FC2FCO,"I just discovered this program from 2003, ""UFOs Under Investigation"" on Amazon streaming under the more lurid title, The Best of Alien Files ALIEN FILES. It begins with the episode, ""UFO Hunters"" which features a good examination of ufology, its methods and the differences in the approach in North America to that of Europe.
Some reviewers have claimed that the series is geared towards debunking, but no, it features a balanced examination of the topic. In particular, I enjoyed hearing the European perspective and thoughtful discussion on the topic. If you are looking for a UFO version of campfire stories, this one is not for you. This is something far more serious that the usual tabloid treatment of the topic.",1435536000,,718,4.991666666666666

I understand almost everyonew wants to believe in things greater than themselves, that there may be benevolent Space Brothers and Sisters ""out there"" who will invite Humanity to join their galactic Federation, and so on.

But PLEASE believe me---this entire presentation is completely made up. There is NO ""Operation Blue Planet"" or whatever they choose to call it. This term, ""Blue Planet,"" is a recent innovation. It has never been called that, until the advent of our relatively new touchy-feely ""save the planet"" culture.

This series is comprised of BS and lies. There has never been any such ""project,"" and if this were true you'd certainly be reading about it EVERYwhere, and around the clock, right? CNN? Huff Po? ABC? Reuters? Jon Leibowitz?
