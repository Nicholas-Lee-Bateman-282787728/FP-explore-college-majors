7984370,4,B00008IARN,"The DVD version of ""Breaking the sound barrier"" 1952, a David Lean production, that I watched is disk one of ""The World War Collection"" May 27, 2008; this is funny as it has nothing to do with a war.

Originally produced by London Films. Copyright 1952 British Lion Film Corporation Ltd. at Shepperton. With the co-operation of the Ministry of Supply and the Director and Members of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors.

The film itself had Great Britton 1952 typed all over it. We get lots of footage of different 50's jets (The de Havilland COMET, The Vickers-Supermarine ATTACKER, the de Havilland VAMPIRE 113, and The Vickers-Supermarine SWIFT Rolls-Royce `Avon' Engine.)

The basic Story and Screenplay by Terence Rattigan is of a father and owner of an aircraft industry. He wants to have the mysterious and unknown sound barrier broken. His excuse is ""because it is there."" It appears to his daughter that he is rather callus and will sacrifice the lives of his own son (Denholm Elliott who played Dr. Marcus Brody in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) and son-in-law to accomplish his goal. Will father and daughter come to terms or understanding of each other's world or will the daughter save her son from a similar fate in the insatiable clutches of her father.",1511136000,,1282,4.871559633027523
7984371,4,B00008IARN,Hobson's Choice is a greatly under-rated film.,1431043200,,46,5.714285714285714
7984372,5,B00008IARN,"Brilliant combination of humor, wit, and sentiment. At first you may be put off by ""Maggie's"" forceful nature. But once you understand her goal of liberating ""Will,"" and recognize her affection is genuine, you really admire her. She is a tremendous example of what strength of character can accomplish, even with the humblest beginning. An intelligent film full of great performances! Can't wait to see it on DVD--soon, please!!!!",1159920000,3,430,5.246376811594203
7984373,5,B00008IARN,"Hobson's Choice is set in nineteeneth century Salford, a grim industrial town in the Manchester area. Henry Hobson (Laughton)is a bootmaker and a tyrant to his family of three daughters, or so he thinks. In fact the business depends on his elest daughter Maggie (Brenda DeBlaze) and his employee Will (John Mills) who is 'the best bootmaker in Lancashire.'Hobson spending most of time at the local pub with his cronies.

When Hobson forbids his daughters to marry, it will cost to much money, Maggie decides to marry Will and set up a rival business to her father. Will who starts off a bit simple minded is not to keen on the idea, but he cannot stand up to Maggie's determined drive to marry and set up  her own business, for which she needs Will's skill as a bootmaker.

The result is an all time great comedy. John Mills and Brenda DeBlaze give great performances, but the prize must go to Charles Laughton. He plays Hobson with the right mixture of bluster and helplesness. Watch him, drunk from a night at the pub, try and catch to moon's refection in a puddle. One of cinema's great moments.

Also watch out for a young Prunella Scales (Sybil in Faulty Towers) as Hobsons youngest daughter, Vicky.

Made at a time when comedies could not depend on farting and sex for laughs, Hobsons Choice will reward any viewer with a great number of laughs and one of cinemas greatest actors at his very best.",1157328000,4,1403,4.596
7984374,1,B00008IARN,"It is amazing to me how obscure a title Hobson's Choice is.  Charles Laughton is again Captain Bly, but he is outdone by his eldest daughter who successfully stages a mutiny against Laughton's no marriage edict.  When she marries Laughton's Casper Milktoast bootmaker and gives him the courage to open his own shop, Laughton faces ruin from the competition and is forced to endure and succumb to his mutinous daughter and her husband.  The film is absolutely hilarious, and unlike most British comedies which are either excruciatingly dry, or founded upon lascivious humor.  All of the characters are extremely believable and overwhelminly endearing.  The movie boasts an absolutely superb script, great acting and great entertainment.

Whatever can be done to get this movie restored and released on DVD should be done.  Who do we write to AFI?  Criterion?  Where do we get the addresses?",1148601600,3,889,5.118055555555555
7984375,5,B00008IARN,I have been waiting for years to see this in DVD and to have my own copy. It is an absolute classic. When will we have it for purchase in DVD format?,1132876800,11,149,3.6875
