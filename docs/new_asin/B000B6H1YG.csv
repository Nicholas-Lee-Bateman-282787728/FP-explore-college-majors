2403144,5,B000B6H1YG,What is marvellous about this movie is that the ending is a total surprise.  The last fifteen minutes of this movie is worth the boring wait.,1319932800,17,141,4.423076923076923
2403145,5,B000B6H1YG,"I did not have high hopes for this flick. In fact, I had never heard of it, which is a bit strange since my profession is in the 'legal field'.

However, when a friend who is a federal judge called and told me this was going to be on TMC he implored me to watch it.

Very glad I did and still hard to believe I had never heard of this flick before.

No great special effects, no great scenery. Just an interesting plot that gives a jolt at the end.

Great Acting by all and a plot that really intensifies as the end nears.

I hate ruining movies by saying what happens in a review so I'll simply say this 'under the radar' movie that not many have heard about, should be seen if you get the chance.

It is not super exciting so to speak, but I think most would give this 4 or 5 stars if they actually watched it. The acting by AQ, KP and especially CN as well as the 'jolt of an ending', make this an easy 4 or 5 star flick.",1309132800,4,924,3.8882978723404253
2403146,4,B000B6H1YG,"""Convicted"" is a mystery that deepens as it delves into a convicted murderer's life.  It starts showing a con man of sorts, Frank Nitzche (Aidan Quinn) a former lawyer who must have been expelled from the bar.  It is not clear, but, at any rate, he has turned con man and earns money befriending people on death row through letters.  He knows how to get their attention and then becomes a friend of sorts that requests they keep in touch up until their death.  He only asks they write a ""last letter"" to him, which usually goes on the market for a good price.  He keeps newspaper articles attached to the wall of current convicted murderers he is writing to, to keep stories straight and sort of a filing system.  Charlotte Cory (Connie Nielsen) , is the only female, and as he starts writing to her she quickly responds that he is the only one that has given her some comfort and to please come and visit her in person.  She also calls him, and he is taken aback, as she requests he come and see her.  When he hesitates she sounds like she will not correspond for the valuable letters he needs.  His agent is furious as this is the prime letter, the only ones from a female on death row and demands he visit her and keep on her ""sweet side"" for a last letter worth $300,000.  So Frank is going under another name in the letters (his name is well known in legal circles).  He devises a disguise and driver's license to get into the prison as the man who cares, and writes the letters.  Soon Frank falls in love with Charlotte, and becomes determined to save her from execution.  Charlotte seems hesitant, which is strange, determined to die.  Charlotte's lawyer (Kelly Preston) has been furiously working on an appeal.  There are many facets to the strange case but Frank races to prove Charlotte's innocence before time runs out.

""Convicted"" is a movie that I had not heard of before- made in 2004.  Very thrilling and absorbing.",1302393600,,1931,4.4714285714285715
2403147,4,B000B6H1YG,Enjoyed the movie a lot.  Kept you in suspense until the end of the movie.  Actors were great and convincing in their roles.,1283817600,2,124,4.3478260869565215
2403148,4,B000B6H1YG,"Aidan Quinn is great as a washed out attorney that now sells death row inmate letters to the media. He corresponds with inmates to get their last letter to sell for a great deal of money. When he meets a woman on death row, played by Connie Nielsen, his attitude changes and we see there is more to him than first thought. This has a good cast and excellent acting. The drama becomes a thriller as the clock ticks down till her execution. When Quinn finds evidence that she in fact is not guilty of kidnapping or murdering a little girl. It may not have lots of scenery but it makes up for it in drama. I highly recommend you at least rent it. I think there is a good chance you will want to buy it. Not appropriate for young children. If you enjoy this be sure to catch ""Perfect Witness"".",1189036800,52,789,4.197368421052632
2403149,5,B000B6H1YG,"Back in 1984, the hit at the Canne Film Festival was another quiet and cerebral film called Paris, Texas - directed by the German director Wim Wenders (but that was then, and this is now). Here, we get the Danish director Billy August creating a hypnotic imaging of desolate Oklahoma small towns, an innocent woman on death row, and the various players around her story in the last days leading up to her execution. As always, Aidan Quinn is just right for his part as a complex lawyer turned tabloid huckster and alcoholic, who finally finds redemption in the last motel on the rain slick streets. But the real standout here is the always underrated Connie Nielsen, who smolders in this performance and the chemistry between her and Quinn is what great movies (and their moments) are made of. I guess in this age of mindless reality TV, films of this quiet beauty, intelligence, and grace are just too slow, pondering, and challenging for today's audiences. Too bad - this film is a keeper and a real gem!",1131408000,95,1006,4.657303370786517

Why did the policeman shoot the bad guy instead of calling for him to drop his weapon???? Also the last minute nature of saving our heroine is of course standard move fare, but not realistic of course.

Excellent in terms of character development, very believable, and gives voice to just how unfair and cruel it is to put people to death. Not only because many innocent people are killed, but because so much of it is politics and often the color of your skin etc.

Also, there would have been anti-capitol punishment advocates there as well, pro-life you might say.

Overwell very well made, the woman on death row was not a stereotypical Hollywood character, she was full fleshed and throughout most of the movie we didn't know but what she might have been guilty. These people were not all good or all bad. I like that.",1411948800,,1000,4.49171270718232

2403281,5,B000B6H1YG,"We've all seen movies like this - perhaps the best is ""A Few Good Men,"" the tension rises well past the eleventh hour, and everyone wonders how in the world Tom and Demi are going to fix this. Then there's the worst of the lot - Clint Eastwood's ""True Crime,"" the most predictable and by-the-numbers ""he didn't do it"" death row yarn ever put to film. Perhaps the granddaddy of them all is the 1982 movie The Verdict, staring Paul Newman, who becomes convinced of his case beyond all reasonable real-world expectation.
Well, ""Convicted"" is up there with the best of them. Even in this era of the might Pause button, I found myself ignoring phone calls and texts because I simply had to find out how this could possibly all work out. What makes this movie work out better than most of its type are the relationships - you begin to care very early on what happens to these people. And by then, you're hooked.",1410048000,2,905,4.457831325301205

The plot becomes a bit twisted and one must be attentive to pick up some of its details. The dialog is sometimes heard at just above a whisper. The characters were strong though in their roles. I like Connie Nielsen in most of her films. She is one of the worlds beauties. Its not a bad movie so just stick with it as it plays out.,1408579200,,457,4.146067415730337

She has few scenes which is fine since she's NOT a very good actor.

2403401,3,B000B6H1YG,"Unique plotline pretty well developed with low-key suspense from an obviously intriguing book.  Aidan Quinn, believable with a Southern accent.  The female lead does a nice job as a death-row prisoner in Texas.  The end surprised me but a totally immersed viewer should figure it out.  If anything's missing it is urgency:  As the storyline brings the prisoner closer and closer to the point of execution in the electric chair, the actors--and the film overall--don't crank up an intensity deep enough to match the threat, imminence and actuality of an approaching execution.  Better direction would have pulled more intensity from the players and managed the film to evoke it in the audience.",1391990400,,693,5.142857142857143

2403410,4,B000B6H1YG,"This was a difficult movie to watch because it seemed so real. The emotions were dark because the story was one that most of us don't savor thinking about: executions. Well, maybe if you live in Texas, you don't mind so much! The idea of a man purposefully getting close to death-row in-mates so that he could publish their personal letters to him (the last being worth the most to the newspapers in Texas most anxious to buy them) is just vile to me.

But the movie turns when this opportunist meets a woman convicted of kidnapping and killing a baby. She's different. Of course she's beautiful (even in prison). But she's also alluring in that ""I've got a secret"" kind of way. He turns from trying to get her fall for his scam to, I suppose, falling for her. That means trying to save her from her fate--the ticking Texas clock.

2403415,4,B000B6H1YG,"How did I miss this excellent thrama (thriller/drama) with the excellent Connie Nielsen and the underused Aidan Quinn? Probably because it is really called ""Return to Sender"" no ""Convicted"" - or in some universe it is one name and in another, the other. IMDB has this film very clearly as ""Return to Sender"", while Amazon, for some odd reason, lists it as ""Convicted"". Even oddlier, IMDB doesn't have any ""trivia"" that talks about the disambiguation of the name, and the few thoughtful (nice) reviews I read don't mention it either. Oh, well. A first rate, very Danish film, with some great OK locations, including Tulsa (where I have been spending a lot of time lately). I believe that is the Philbrook Museum of Art (pre modern additions) standing in for the School for the Blind. Great stuff, and nice to see Tim Daly of Wings in a film.

After watching 45 mins. of it, I was convinced I'd missed something on why this movie was rated so highly.  I just couldn't get through it.  The characters were unsympathetic, the story had this long, dreary tone supported by lots of dragging along watching nothing happen.  But, then I went back and looked at the top reviews and realized they were pretty much saying they liked it despite of or because of that --- things like ""poem toned"", ""quiet movie"", etc. translate into what I found to be a draggy, sad bore.

2403471,4,B000B6H1YG,"I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this movie, based on some of the comments.  Instead, however, I ended up glad that I'd lucked out and found a good movie to watch!  (That is, it wasn't one of those Prime movies that I click off after half an hour, because it just isn't holding my attention.)

Yes, it did start slowly, as some have noted, and yes, the bleak Oklahoma landscape shown in the beginning isn't much appealing.  Even so, as the viewer soon discovers, in this ""it looks like nothing happens here"" environment, there is a LOT going on behind the scenes!  What the movie does well is to artfully present, through character interactions, a reliable stream of hints and clues about those ""not so ordinary"" happenings.  This sustained suspense makes the movie compelling and intriguing.

Connie Nielsen is outstanding in her portrayal of a widow convicted of child kidnap and murder.  She doesn't necessarily ""act"" like a cold-blooded killer (isn't dead behind the eyes, etc.).  Still, she presents enough of an odd detachment, along with some quirkiness, that I kept wondering if she'd committed the crime or not.  Well along into the movie, I still didn't know quite how to regard her, and so (as part of that suspense factor), I was always wanting to know more.

Aidan Quinn, playing a washed up attorney with seemingly shady motives, is likewise more than he first seems to be at the movie's outset.  His character experiences a slow metamorphosis, which caused me to increasingly warm up to his role.  I respect a movie which delivers plausibility for a character's evolving perspectives (because it seems like the script is respecting me as a viewer).  Here, Quinn's confusion, his reflection, his twists and turns, etc., are never forced, and so they never arbitrarily manipulate the audience.  Rather, they serve to give his character depth and appeal.

Kelly Preston, as the attorney for the convict, has a smaller role, but the story would not have been nearly as good without her!  She is very well-cast, and lends a strong presence.  Her nuanced portrayal makes her character seem like a real person who happens to practice law (rather than being a stick figure caricature of a lawyer).  Rarely do I see a film where three key characters all end up giving top notch performances, but I'm glad to say that this movie is a fine exception.  The supporting characters were also good, for the most part.

I had no problem keeping my interest from the beginning.  Even so, I noticed that I was getting more and more drawn in as the movie progressed, and that was a great feeling.  One reviewer here said that the final 15 minutes were what made the movie worthwhile.  It's true that the conclusion is a stirring reward.  Still, I could never dismiss what comes before it, because the context and character developments offered prior to the finale, are completely essential.  All kinds of seemingly unrelated loose threads get wrapped up then, and it all happens in ways that cannot be predicted.

For me, the story lacks some plausibility, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.  Still, I was more than happy to sacrifice some plausibility for a compelling sense of suspense and well-drawn characters.  I like a movie that's as much about the characters as it is about the plot.

The subtle pacing invited more engagement from me than I'd likely give to, say, an action movie.  The fact that my attention was required especially made the movie ""get into me.""  I was engaged enough that after the video concluded, I found myself musing a bit, speculating about what would happen next to the characters shown in the final scene.  Having enjoyed the movie a lot, I guess I didn't want it to be over!

Go and ahead and give the video a try (especially if you're a Prime member!).  I think you'll enjoy it.",1362182400,15,3829,4.741301059001513

2403479,3,B000B6H1YG,"This is a fairly decent movie. An honest film that few will be able to call the ending of. If you are a Connie Nielsen fan she doesn't disappoint. There is one scene in particular though that makes the flick worth watching regardless. It's a moment of black comedy. There's a one-liner that made me laugh so hard I had to hit pause. Watch for it when a man is visiting an inmate in prison, and the guards are called out of the room. I will catalog this one-liner with the many great lines uttered in film, such as ""Charlie don't Surf!"", and ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse"". The line from Convicted though is dirty. Very dirty. You have been warned. ;>",1342915200,8,668,4.267716535433071
2403480,4,B000B6H1YG,"All three of the main actors in this pic did a fine job. Connie Neilsen I had figured out all wrong, Kelly Preston did a UNbelieveable job as a defense attorney that gets so wrapped-up in a case that it consumes her (well, I happen to have dated 3 def. atty's and I haven't met one that devoted yet) Aiden Quinn fine job as always and I  had him figured out wrong too. The movie takes some unexpected twists and left me surprised b/c each time I thought I had it down it switched-up! made me feel awful cynical. PK. Collins",1331510400,11,523,4.178217821782178
