3726817,5,B001O4C6IK,"I enjoy Pilates, but I find it very difficult sometimes to perform/hold some of the moves, so I was very happy to come across this DVD and the series, ""For Beginners"", by Acacia in which the instructor demonstrates the beginner/modified move, rather than talking about it as a sideline. For example, the hundred can be done sitting up rather than lying supine with head up and a single leg teaser using your hands to hold your thighs to sit up--bright idea! Then, at times, the full move is shown to something you can progress to. This is a Pilates mat work with intense core moves. The menu options include 20 minutes of core warm-up and core connection plus 20 minutes each for the foundation work and strong back section. Instructor Kristin has a permanent smile and seems to look at the camera too much, but her tips are very helpful.",1275782400,15,838,4.593333333333334
3726818,5,B001O4C6IK,This is a wonderful beginers workout.  Very happy with purchase.  Received quickly and in excellent shape.  Would do business agian.,1271030400,2,132,5.5
3726819,5,B001O4C6IK,"I am a senior citizen with bad knees from injuries.  I can do almost all of these exercises and hope that with time, I'll be able to do them all though I don't know if I'll ever be able to do things that puts pressure on my kneecaps.  I'm modifying those that are too much at this point.  It's easy to fit these strengthening exercises into my early morning schedule without a lot of fuss.  And boy can I see the results.",1266537600,14,421,4.097560975609756
3726820,4,B001O4C6IK,"This workout features two ten-minute routines and two twenty-minute workouts. I would say the moves range from very basic (step-by-step instruction, might feel a little slow for someone with a little experience but it still keeps you moving) to basic (moves aren't performed quite as slow) to advanced beginner (adequate instruction but much less broken down; exercise becomes progressively more challenging).

Throughout the video, Kristin shows you how to ""cheat"" by holding the backs of your thighs or bending your knees for some of the moves then she may ask you to do one last challenge and try full versions of the exercise.  She also gives you a break between most exercises but it's in the form a stretch so you don't feel like you're wasting time.

All workouts start in a seated position, so for those who aren't quite flexible or brand spanking new to Pilates, you might want to do a little warm-up to get those muscles limber before you get started.

Workouts (in order on DVD):

Core Warm-up (10 Minutes--Very Basic):  Seated ""100,"" ""100"" (with a breakdown of how to the exercise then an actual performance of the exercise), roll-up, spine stretch, saw, twist

Core Connection (10 Minutes--Basic):  Single toe taps, double toe taps, arm circles, ""the bug"",  single leg plie bends (right side), leg circles (right side), repeat last of the two exercises on the left, bridge, bridge with leg extensions, double leg plie bends

Foundation Work (20 Minutes--Basic to Advanced Beginner):  Single leg stretch, double leg stretch, single leg straight leg stretch, double leg straight leg stretch, criss cross (a.k.a. bicycle crunches), ""rolling like a ball"", tick-tock, hip thrusts(these are pretty hard), double leg circles, ""open leg rocker"", back kicks, ""Ballerina Butt Lift"", heel beats, neck pull, half neck pull, half neck pull with a twist, ""shaving"", single leg teaser, full teaser

Strong Backside:  (20 Minutes--Basic to Advanced Beginner):  Leg circles, leg lifts, kicks, bicycles, taps, inner thigh leg circles, inner thigh leg lifts, the clam, mermaid stretch, spinal twist, hip stretch, Can-Can (4 variations), repeat of leg series through hip stretch), ""Little Piece of Heaven"" (a child's pose/push up combo), back lifts, ""swimming"", an arm/leg stretch in a tabletop position

Bonus Features:  A Pilates Workout Tips Booklet with Bonus Moves cards (moves are different from what are on the DVD, meant to be used as in addition to this DVD), Pilates Tutorial (about 5 minutes--shows how to achieve a neutral pelvis and Pilates ""V"" both in the standing and seated positions; she uses the ""100"" as an sample exercise), 10 minute segment from Exhale: Core Fusion Pilates Plus (Thighs & Glutes), a 5 minute segment from Weight Loss Pilates (the first 5 minutes of Flow 1), and a biography of Kristin McGee

What I liked:

1.  There is plenty of variety with these workouts, virtually no repeats from one workout segment to the next.

2.  The upper body is not neglected so you get a total body workout (""shaving"" is a new fav of mine for the triceps).

3.  Kristin is very personable and gives good instruction.

4.  The work outs are customizable (think the 10-Min Solutions DVDs)

5.  Some pretty cool extras!!

What I didn't like:

1.  I would have liked there to be an actual warm-up for these workouts.

2.  Some of the moves that require you lift yourself up (i.e. the hip thrusts and double leg circle) might prove a bit too hard for a beginner.

But all in all,  a pretty solid workout.",1263427200,113,3510,4.963979416809606
3726821,5,B001O4C6IK,"I'm definitely a beginner at Pilates, or any type of ""mat"" workout.

I like that this workout does not require any equipment (if you have a carpeted floor, you don't even need a mat).  The explanations are understandable if you haven't done this before.  The work out is challenging and while I can't do all the reps of some of the exercises yet, there is nothing that is totally impossible for a somewhat inflexible 50-year-old to do.  I know it's really toning up my middle -- the waistband on my jeans is not as tight as it used to be.

I bought four DVDs at about the same time, and do different routines on different days, typically some each of the stretching, core/Pilates and knees about 5 days a week.  It's been a month, and there is a difference in how I feel . . . and my husband says also in how I look and move.  I'd recommend any or all of the four I got -- they each have a little different workout:

This is a great beginner's program with some challenging moves that I look forward to being able to do.  I know it's good because I can still feel it just a little bit the next day.  Kristin's personality is engaging and not too perky.  As a healthy but not very flexible guy, I'm very picky about my fitness DVDs, and I know this is a good one for both men and women.",1253664000,25,451,4.033707865168539

3726854,5,B001O4C6IK,Great video. Has 2 different 10 minute warm ups and 2 different 30 minute workouts. This video is geared toward strengthening the back and core.,1487116800,,144,4.8

3726856,5,B001O4C6IK,"Great for beginners and great for when you have to start back at square one when you've fallen off the Pilates wagon. It's challenging, but not overly so. She's great at describing proper form and reminding you to revert back to it when she knows you've reached a tough spot and begin slipping. I very much recommend.",1483315200,3,317,4.578947368421052
3726857,4,B001O4C6IK,"Just starting to work with the program, so I do not have a lot to say at this point. Seems OK thus far.",1483228800,,103,3.5217391304347827
3726858,5,B001O4C6IK,Great video.  Not too fast paced for those just learning how to do Pilates moves.,1478822400,,81,4.4
3726859,5,B001O4C6IK,"I like that you can pick and choose the workouts. I have never done Pilates, and this was very very doable. I finished up the full session thinking ""that wasn't so hard"" and then as I was walking around I noticed that most of my muscles were trembling. Hunh. That's impressive. You definitely do not notice how hard you are working, and she generally doesn't push too far, it's just enough. You can do one or choose combos. In this set you'll learn to use proper positioning and breathing to strengthen your abdominals with maximum benefit using core fundamentals of Pilates. I really, really loved the Stretch segment, particularly the Lunge sequence to stretch the hip flexors. Ah, heaven! Two exceptions - I did have problem with the knee pushups with the feet in the air - that hurt my knees, and I just don't have the upper body strength yet, so I punked out halfway. Same with a side raise that went just that bit longer than I could do. But if I can only not do 2 exercise in several minutes she's doing things right. This Pilates Routine is so great, that I so from the beginning on real results!!!",1475539200,11,1106,4.48019801980198

3726861,3,B001O4C6IK,Not exactly for beginners.,1471392000,,26,5.75
3726862,5,B001O4C6IK,Like this beginners DVD. Some moves were hard for me but mostly manageable since I am 66 yrs old but do exercise everyday. I felt it the next day thru my midriff & stomach..so something had to be working :). Would recommend,1470355200,2,223,4.333333333333333
3726873,4,B001O4C6IK,"This is exactly what I was looking for. A hand-holding first look at pilates, but with enough challenge to get a real work out. For that, I'd really like to give it 5 stars. She's a very pleasant host, with a nice voice and her reminders are well timed (softening shoulders etc.)  I can tell I'm going to continue with this video for quite some time to come.

Just a couple negatives made me take a star, but they really aren't a deal breaker.  First, I'm going to research some ways to make sure I'm protecting my neck during pilates, since many of the exercises have you lifting head and neck off of ground. She briefly mentions a block, but being a beginner, I don't even yet know what that tool is all about. Also,  Kristin says in the beginning the video is broken down into 2 ten-minute work outs and 2 twenty-minute workouts.  However, there isn't a very noticeable break in the workouts. This probably isn't a problem if you are using a DVD and you can use the top menu to go to the session you want. But if you are streaming like I am from the Amazon Acacia subscription, its really hard to choose the workout. I'm interested in trying the last one, but my stamina can only take the first 2 ten minute and part of the first 20 minute one. I haven't yet figured out what time stamp to fast forward to and start the individual workouts. Maybe there is some trick I'm missing with that?",1455321600,7,1392,4.318007662835249
3726874,4,B001O4C6IK,this is okay but not quite what I truly wanted. It does give you a nice workout if you are a beginner,1446940800,,101,3.6363636363636362
3726875,5,B001O4C6IK,"This is the best Pilates DVD I have found. It is important to focus on using the small muscles in your core when you do pilates and Kristen does that very well while showing, pleasantly how to do piltates for beginners.",1446508800,,219,4.365853658536586

3726880,4,B001O4C6IK,"This is a great DVD for someone who is just starting out in Pilates. Kristen goes at a slower pace and really takes the time to explain the core muscle movements, I highly recommend.",1405987200,,182,4.382352941176471
3726881,5,B001O4C6IK,Wanted to try Pilates and this was the perfect beginning for me. I could easily do all the moves but was left sweating if I really concentrated on what i was doing. I hope to continue with more of her dvd's. Looking forward to some improved abs and posture!,1403740800,,257,4.26530612244898
3726882,5,B001O4C6IK,The video is really for beginners which is perfect for me.  She pauses a few seconds between several of the different moves which gives my body enough time to rest and become ready for the next move.  She explains the moves very well.  I haven't done Pilates in a long time and this has been a great way for me to get back into it.,1395964800,,331,4.061538461538461
3726893,4,B001O4C6IK,"She does not explain Pilates breathing and does not spend much time on pelvic alignment.  Otherwise the instruction within the video is quite good.  The third of the four workouts is not really for beginners, but the other three are manageable.",1390176000,3,244,4.926829268292683

3726895,3,B001O4C6IK,"It's not very appealing. I looked at it one time and haven't felt interested enough to continue using it. Perhaps when I'm away and without classes at my gym, I'll use it.",1387497600,,171,4.375
3726896,5,B001O4C6IK,"I've owned this DVD for a couple of years now. Originally, I checked it out of the library to do a test-run, since I've used my share of poor workout DVDs that claim to be for beginners, yet are terribly complex in their steps or experience level. Kristin is really the ideal host - she offers encouragement throughout the workout and is upbeat, but isn't fake to the point that you want to punch her when she says ""one more"". I find this to be rare in the industry! The workouts themselves are easy to follow, and just challenging enough that you will feel it the next day! They are not so difficult that you won't be able to complete most of it, or will be out of commission for a week after pushing yourself too hard. Perfect balance!",1387065600,3,737,4.309352517985611
3726897,5,B001O4C6IK,"Very easy to use as a beginning Pilates student.  I love her enthusiasm and thorough descriptions of the moves, as well as the format of the video.  It is easy to choose what you want.  I felt much more encouraged than I expected after the first time of giving Pilates a try.  Have ordered quite a few beginning Pilates DVD's in the past but found them to be discouraging.",1383523200,2,372,4.3478260869565215
3726898,5,B001O4C6IK,"I had no previous Pilates experience when I ordered this video, but I very much enjoy doing the workouts. There are shorter, warm-up workouts to start with, and it is easy to tailor the video to your wants and needs. The longer, full workouts are certainly difficult, but I found through time and practice everything was do-able.  I recommend this video for any beginner who wants a fun workout that will make you work hard!",1382313600,2,424,4.653333333333333
3726899,2,B001O4C6IK,"Some of the exercises on this dvd aren't really meant for beginners.  I've never had back trouble before but after using this video for a few weeks I've started having a lot of lower back pain.  The instruction on the video wasn't very clear to me so I thought I must not be doing the exercises correctly.  After looking around online I learned that as a beginner I don't have the core strength yet to pull off some of these moves correctly without straining by lower back.  There are a few modifications that can be done to keep from hurting yourself while you build up strengh, but she doesn't go over any of these in the video.",1378166400,33,630,4.358974358974359
3726900,5,B001O4C6IK,"I never tried Pilates before and was curious.  I have been practicing for only a few weeks, so don't know about results, but this program replaces a practice that I had been doing for several years and I needed a change.  I an not a fan of doing numerous repetitions, and this program does not require such.  I like the flexibility in choosing from the workouts, and the moves are well explained by Kristin as she goes through them.",1375488000,4,432,4.443037974683544

3726902,5,B001O4C6IK,"Kristin McGee does a great job of demonstrating easy to follow exercises, which give you amazing benefits no matter what your fitness level is.  This is especially good for middle age people who have hit a plateau in their fitness level.

There are two - ten minutes workouts and two - twenty minutes workouts which is perfect for people who do not have a lot of time to workout in the morning.

3726926,5,B001O4C6IK,This DVD is great for increasing core strength. I am in my 60's and am fairly out of shape. So I ordered Pilates for Beginners.  I am able to do most of the exercise moves and feel that my core strength is definitely improving. I have only had the DVD for a couple of weeks. I am looking forward to using it regularly. I would highly recommend this to those who are new to Pilates and are somewhat out of shape.,1363305600,4,411,4.074074074074074

3726928,4,B001O4C6IK,"I am not ""green"" when it comes to pilates. I have been doing simple pilates moves ever since I saw some workouts in Cosmo magazine years ago. However, there's nothing like good instruction to help you keep form and pace. This DVD does the trick for me. I bought the beginner version because I'm not an avid exerciser and I just wanted something to help me strengthen my weak core muscles. I knew most of the exercises on this DVD, but I wasn't using proper form and breathing (it's difficult to pick that up just by looking at pictures on a page). The instruction is good and Kristin always reminds you to ""keep your shoulders soft"" or ""don't shift your hips."" It's almost like she is right there with you. I also like that you can customize your routine for days when you have more/less time for a workout. I don't have much to complain about regarding this dvd, other than i wish there were more varied routines to choose from.",1357862400,9,929,4.43859649122807
3726929,5,B001O4C6IK,This DVD is perfect for beginners - so easy yet I felt my sore muscles the next day. Pilates really builds good core muscles and helps with balance  and really good for older people.,1354147200,,182,4.352941176470588

As a relative beginner, I experienced no difficulty with most of the very basic moves, and I found some of them a little too basic, but if I did all the exercises, bonuses not included on the DVD, I found that I was quite worn out.
  Some of the detractors related to the DVD was that I did not feel that the instructor focused enough on proper breath related to the moves. I felt that this would have rendered some of the more challenging moves easier. I would definitely keep working with the DVD, but I would probably turn elsewhere if I wanted to know the proper breaths for some of these moves.",1327622400,4,677,4.24031007751938
