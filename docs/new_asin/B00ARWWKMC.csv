8557268,3,B00ARWWKMC,"brief synopsis:  Astronaunt Steve Rogers wildest fantasy comes true when his spaceship crash lands on a planet inhabited solely by ultra-sexy, whiskey-swilling cowgirls ecstatic to finally have a man in their misdst.

But will Steve go for the sultry sheriff, the frisky mayor or the demure barmaid?  Turns out, the decision may not be up to him after all.",1300838400,,356,5.0
8557269,3,B00ARWWKMC,"There just was not enough attention to detail in the writing or crisp editing, or directing in this film. A waste of talent, essentially.",1197158400,,137,4.75
8557270,2,B00ARWWKMC,"I was under the assumption that this movie would be more campy and fun than it actually is. It is really pretty boring, and has more nudity than I expected or desired. The film concerns the crash landing of a 'hunky' astronaut  (Troy Vincent), who is an intergalactic garbage man, on the planet of Puckerbush Gulch (subtle, no?) inhabited, of course, by nothing but women. Of course, they generally harass him, and eventually the sheriff and mayor battle it out for him in what has to be THE stupidest duel in history, but he eventually falls for the beautiful barmaid, Lily (Betsy Lynn George) thwarting the evil civic leaders.
There are many low points in this monstrosity, but I will only mention three: he is unable to communicate with Earth because his 'transgalactic communicator' has a broken 'positronic spacely sprocket' (which makes me wonder if Hanna-Barbera could sue); he dances to disco music in the bar, which filled me with revulsion; and he puts on several changes of clothes in an attempt to get the right look (just think flamenco dancer here and you can see why this is much worse than it sounds.)
This movie utterly fails on so many levels that I can't list them all. It can't decide what it wants to be, and as a result, is really just a mess. I gave it two stars for having the lovely Betsy Lynn George (according to the internet she is now a gymnastics teacher) in the cast; otherwise it is a waste of time.",1079049600,9,1431,4.5680933852140075
8557271,1,B00ARWWKMC,"I originally got into B-movie Sci-Fi because of Torchlight Entertainment. When one watches one of these films, one does not expect high art. One expects a certain amount of amusing camp or perhaps interesting ""adult"" entertainment. That said, two of the films by Torchlight, ""Beach Babes from Beyond"" and ""Test Tube Teens from the Year 2000"" (aka ""The Virgin Hunters"") delivered in spades. I went on to discover other films in the genre that while not contenders for an Academy Award, did provide some level of amusement. One might suggest ""Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity"" or even ""Beach Babes 2: Cave Girl Island"". When I ordered Petticoat Planet, I expected the same. I was disappointed.
Even with low expectations, the plot of this film is just insulting. An astronaut crash lands on a planet inhabited solely by women who live in an old west cowboy society. Being the only man on the planet, he is immediately thrust into a slew of sexual scenarios.
The film fails however on the two levels that one might expect it to succeed along. The story is not engaging. The situations simply are not funny. The astronaut simply encounters woman after woman who are interested in exploring sex with him. The entire thing is not only predictable (as these films tend to be) but also simply does not give the viewer any reason to care or even be amused.
If one is interested in watching a film for the ""adult"" entertainment value, then one could certainly choose better. If erotica is your thing, you could find any number of films where the eroticism is treated much more carefully. The ""sex"" in this film generally consists of Captain Rogers (the man) being alone with one of the cowgirls and her being unable to resist him and so she performs a strip tease for him. However, the dancing is always uninspired, and the viewer will quickly become bored with it (in fact, the captain himself becoems bored with the situation and tries to find true love). After the dance, Rogers is so turned on that presumedly he decides to have sex with each of the women, however one cannot know for sure because the scenes always end at this point and we segue into another situation where some other woman will attempt to seduce him in essentially the same scenario.
Whether you are looking for camp or for eroticism, you can easily find other films that will serve your purposes better.
The film is not insulting or disturbing or in any other way deserving a truly negative comment. But because of its total and utter pointlessness, I must give it my lowest possible recommendation.",976492800,39,2564,4.738255033557047
8557272,3,B00ARWWKMC,"This is movie starts with our ""hero"" crash landing on a planet populated only by women.  It seems that the men were all so stupid that they all died in a mining accident.  The women now run things and the one  and only city on this planet is like the old west.  Needless to say, plot  is non-existant. Women are decent looking though, and nudity is fairly  frequent.  If you're looking for a few minor laughs and some good looking  women taking their clothes off and wondering what the old west was like  without men, than this is the video for you.  The 3 Stars are strictly for  the women.",938995200,37,591,4.281818181818182
