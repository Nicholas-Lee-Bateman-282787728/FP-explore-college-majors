As a small child I remember my father entertaining family and guests with Angora Love.  Since I now raise goats, the film is doubly important to me. After I explain it's importance to me, I want my children and grandchildren to see it and try to appreciate it the way I do.",1382572800,,376,4.328571428571428
7909257,5,B00000I21D,"This film was shot in the spring of 1929 though not released till that December; like 'Bacon Grabbers,' their penultimate silent to be released, it too suffered from being released shortly after the Stock Market Crash and the talkie revolution.  Predictably it wasn't in theatres very long and didn't have the same care put into the soundtrack as their silents of 1927 and 1928 had had.  The story is very memorable and funny, and has extra appeal to me since I'm such an animal lover.  Goats have long been among my favorite domesticated animals as well.  A stray goat begins following Stan and Ollie, but Ollie refuses to take it along with them, believing goats to be bad luck.  The goat is extraordinarily attached to Stan (who fed her a doughnut when they first met) and keeps following him even after they try to walk fast to get away from the goat.  This is very bad for them because the police believe they have stolen the goat, who has already been reported missing and had a reward posted, and now begin trying to hunt them down.  The boys manage to sneak the goat into the boarding house they wind up at (a ploy done in their sound shorts 'The Chimp' and 'Laughing Gravy,' the latter of which is a veritable remake of 'Angora Love' but for the strong sentimental plot and the animal being a dog and not a goat).  However, their landlord (Edgar Kennedy) keeps hearing noises and noticing other fishy things going on, and though the boys keep hiding the goat before he comes in, he finally outsmarts them and catches them in the act as they're giving the goat a bath.  Edgar goes to get the police involved, but they end up thinking he's the one who kidnapped the goat.  There's also a really cute twist ending.

Since this film was released when silent film had all but officially been pronounced dead, it doesn't always get as much attention and respect as it should, being overlooked in the boys' silent canon now and being thought of as a hopelessly outdated relic back then.  However, it shows that silent comedy had really hit its peak and stride in the late Twenties, and comes off a lot funnier and fresher today than many very early sound comedies now do.  There's also a priceless bit in the film where Mr. Kennedy is saying that this is a boarding house where you can't get away with bad behavior and he has high moral standards to uphold as the landlord, while behind him you can see a sailor and a prostitute walking into one of the rooms!  That kind of gag never would have seen it past the Hays Office a few short years down the road.",1139011200,,2558,4.473118279569892
7909258,4,B00000I21D,"The last silent Laurel & Hardy flick.  I can bet that just seeing these two as they appear on the silver screen in the silent film era made people laugh and once sound came into movie, the cry of Stan Laurel make you laugh even harder.  Here Ollie does not want a goat because he believes they are bad luck.  This goat was troublesome and got them into a mess but also gets them out.  I am really glad the their films are still available can be purchased.",1114905600,,455,4.136363636363637
7909259,4,B00000I21D,"""Angora Love,"" aptly enough given the title, involves a stray goat that has attached itself to the boys.  Laurel & Hardy take it back to their room despite the ""No Pets"" rule and wackiness ensues.  This 1929 comedy directed by Lewis Foster from a story by Leo McCarey with one day legendary film director George Stevens working the camera, has the distinction of being the last complete silent film by Laurel & Hardy.  The best sequence is when Ollie tries to give the goat a bath and things go from bad to worse when Stan lends a hand.  This is an average Laurel & Hardy two-reeler more noteworthy for the talent behind the camera than what happens in front.",989539200,3,659,4.512605042016807
