8742791,1,B018RO328M,Terrible.  No plot.  Poor acting.  Just an excuse to provide audience with whatever the producer thought was tantalizing.  Which it wasn't.,1506643200,,139,5.476190476190476
8742792,3,B018RO328M,"DVD is defaulted to Italian dubbed language and Italian subtitle text . You can turn the Italian off and watch and listen in its original language choice audio which is Moroccan Arabic. I would have liked English. DVD must not be for the English, French and or any other language. Must be due to the Moroccan censorship of this movie and (my guess) plus cost overruns.",1493596800,,368,4.590909090909091
