8197955,2,B000QXCOUK,The content of the documentary was good but I was very unhappy with the length of the program. It was less than 25 minutes long. The product description never gave the length of the DVD. It was priced as a regular DVD price. I understand it was a TV program but expected it to be closer to an hour.,1214784000,4,298,4.067796610169491
8197956,4,B000QXCOUK,"I have read several books on polygamy and recently the newly released book
by Carolyn Jessop "" My Escape from Polygamy"" and i found everything that Flora Jessop talks about in the dvd(Not sure if she's related to Carolyn but no doubt somehow) is accurate and true about the events in Colorado City.  Since this aired in 2004 of course, events have happened such as the capture of Warren Jeffs,  but for someone wanting to know anything about polygamy this is short but gets to the point.",1201651200,7,487,4.586206896551724
