7993224,1,B00009VTX4,Actually I never watched it. It was my mistake in electing this DVD. I thought it was the one with the same title about an art forger. I really shouldn't give it any stars.,1392681600,,172,4.088235294117647
7993225,5,B00009VTX4,All my favorite actors in this film.  Story line was believable and I could say i enjoyed this very much.,1354147200,4,105,4.25
7993226,3,B00009VTX4,This movie was okay.  I've seen better and I've seen worst.  If I had the option to see it before I bought it then I would've kept my money.  They put Vanessa Williams on the cover to sell it because she wasn't even a main character.,1298332800,,233,4.021739130434782
7993227,5,B00009VTX4,I bought this DVD a few years ago and decided to now write a brief review because I have watched it repeatedly.  The storyline is intriguing and the acting is fine.  It is the story of a young exec who is raped by a murderer.  The plot twists and turns through her protection by the bodyguard (character played by the handsome Richard T. Jones) that is hired by her father (character played by suave Ron Glass).  This movie captivated my attention with it's mystique tinged with melancholy.  The movie is also rather haunting in tone as the victim and the bodyguard are eventually drawn to each other.  This DVD is not a shelf-sitter as one is drawn back to it for multiple viewings.  Hats off to all in the making of this winner!,1230336000,13,730,4.443609022556391
