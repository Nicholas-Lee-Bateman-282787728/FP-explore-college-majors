768077,5,6304052936,"A refreshing script filled with engaging, well written and well acted characters, with a simple and straightforward plot that's refreshingly novel in its use of aliens  attempting to conquer Earth and commit genocide in the process.  And the production is top-rate, rushing nothing and being properly paced.  There are even some nice period pieces that, in their own arcane way, are educational.  What more could one ask for?

What's not to like?  Even the story's most glaring oversight is EASILY forgiven, given the weight and credibility this story otherwise carries.  Eric Saward's first script is stellar (and his subsequent ""Earthshock"" is also very effective).  (that oversight?  Nyssa suggests historians will be baffled if they discover any strewn power packs (which are smaller than the size of a pill bottle).  Yet the Tereleptils' escape pod never got dealt with and is rather easier to find, thanks to its size.  But, again, the story makes it easy to overlook that.)

Best of all are the one-liners and jibes each character makes at apropos moments during the story; it's the quality and quantity of dialogue that sets this story (nevermind the series ""Doctor Who"") from any given sci-fi drivel produced today, let alone back then.

As usual, the restoration work never ceases to impress and, indeed, for a single layer disc the transfer looks very good indeed.  (UK customers are treated with dual-layer discs and, as such, get much better looking copies, but the US releases have generally been quite passable too.)

And the sound is, as usual, superlative.

And there's a slew of extras:  An isolated soundtrack of the music score, which only made me happy.  The style of music used in this era could never be matched, and it's great to have the music separated so it can be enjoyed on its own.  Also included, much to my surprise and delight, was a decent documentary of the scoring of the story that includes composer Paddy Kingsland.  A fanboy's dream!  Or the dream of anybody who'd want to know about how a story is composed, or anyone who likes to know how shows and movies are put together.  It's informative and Paddy's musical style is easily one of the best the series has ever had...  But yet this doco wasn't as good as others.  That's not to say I didn't welcome this extra!  Very few series get this sort of treatment and I must say many more series deserve this sort of treatment!  It's still B+.

I've not yet watched the other documentaries and extras, but I'd easily guess they'd be of the usual quality.  But I can say the audio commentaries from the main cast is, as with Earthshock, wonderful to listen to.  Great to have the four of them back together for reminiscing, even if they rib their performances or how it was filmed.  :-)  (Heck, it's entertaining and the chemistry between them is wonderful, though I won't reveal any spoilers there...  heh. )",1110931200,5,2893,4.793522267206478
768078,5,6304052936,"Ask any Doctor Who fan to pick their favorite era of the show and they will each pick a different Doctor as their favorite, and likely decry the others as being nowhere near as good. It all seems to depend on your age and when you first became interested in the show. For me, who started watching in the Patrick Troughton tenure as the Doctor and became riveted to the show in the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker eras, I find it hard not to be disappointed with what came later. The BBC have again released two stories on DVD from opposing eras of the show and certainly nothing here is likely to change my mind about what I like most.

First up is the Jon Pertwee story ending his fourth season as the intrepid Time Lord - The Green Death. For many, this is one of the most evocative and best-remembered stories from his five-year stint in the role. With a remarkable eye on future events, this story has once again led the way from being science fiction to many science facts. The storyline of a mega-corporation polluting the planet and sinisterly controlling our behavior is hardly stuff of fantasy anymore, alas. But thirty years ago, it was only a nightmare of a possibly frightening future.

The problems with many of the Pertwee stories were of length and budget. Six part stories tended to be heavily padded to make the money go further and often sagged badly in the middle. I'm glad to say The Green Death is not one of those. Of course, it might have been tighter had it only stretched to four episodes and undoubtedly if it was made today it would be trimmed to one fifty minute romp, but it works very well in it's longer format. There are flaws of course, but all these can be washed away by the very, very poignant and indeed tear-jerking ending that sets the show apart from much of what had gone before. Losing one of the show's regular characters was often hard on viewers but somehow the departure of Jo Grant, the third Doctor's long standing second assistant, had a very big impact on the audience, possibly more so than the exit of any previous leading lady in the show. By far one of the most successful partnerships ever created for the show, even now, viewers can tell that the acting by the two leads as they parted ways was heightened by very real sadness. Indeed, Katy Manning, the lovely actress who played Jo for three years, becomes very emotional in her commentary for this release as she relives the parting scene all these years later.

It's the commentary and the extras that always make these releases so special and Katy, together with Script Editor Terrance Dicks and Producer Barry Letts, provide a genuinely interesting narrative, which is hugely enjoyable. Clearly a close team, they all lament the absence of the Doctor himself, the late Jon Pertwee. There could have been a certain amount of discomfort in the commentary, since Jo Grant leaves the Doctor when she falls in love and intends to marry Professor Jones. In reality, Katy Manning was indeed engaged to the actor playing Jones, Stewart Bevan, and their subsequent marriage only lasted a few months. Tactfully, none of this is mentioned in the commentary or by Bevan's own contribution to the disc. In addition, a terrifically funny documentary on what happened after the show is worth purchasing the disc alone.

I can't say the same for The Visitation, the second of the new releases, pulled from the first season to feature Peter Davison in the Time Lord's shoes. It's certainly not a bad four part romp and there's a lot to commend it in terms of production values and a fine guest cast, but it's symptomatic of the era that the squabbling and frankly badly acted regular cast get in the way of a good story. Interestingly, in this story, Davison's Doctor loses his temper with all three of his companions and as a viewer, you really can't blame him. Individually they may have all worked as characters, but there were just too many of them to make scenes work effectively. But it's another twist on the Doctor explaining Earth history via science fiction and a clever idea in itself and well executed.

Recorded second, but transmitted fourth, Davison was still finding his way in the part but he was hampered by the inexperience of the cast he was expected to carry and alas the story fails as a result. Things certainly did improve later, but these were still very early days. Thankfully, the on screen bickering of the four main leads clearly didn't translate into `real life' and their commentary is genuinely funny and entertaining, particularly as they gleefully point out each other's rather limited acting ability.

The extras on this disc are slightly less impressive and almost became tedious, but they're still worthy of inclusion and hardcore fans will certainly be pleased to have them.

All in all, another great pair of releases showcasing different approaches to the long running classic adventure serial. Well worth the investment and a must for any collector.",1110153600,3,4978,4.701834862385321
768079,5,6304052936,"Two historical adventures, one quasi-, the other a period adventure set in 1920's Britain.  The first, The Visitation, has the Doctor and his companions landing in the England of 1666, where they are mistaken for plague carriers and nearly killed if not for the intervention of Richard Mace, an itinerant thespian who has been taking refuge in a barn.  Mace saw a comet as the sign of things to come.  However, according to the Doctor, Earth isn't due for a comet for a couple years.  And the discovery of higher technology pinpoints to aliens on Earth, and thus to the manor where the barn's owner lives.  However, the manor is under control of the Terileptils, (inspired by the words territorial reptiles), whose leader becomes interested in the Doctor as he sees the Time Lord foil his servants, villagers controlled by a crude form of mental control.
At first, Richard Mace is skeptical at the Doctor's explanations for the strange occurrences, but he comes to trust the unconventional Time Lord.  The representation of manners and customs of 17th century England is accurately shown in Mace, who tells the Time Lord that one should be humble and respectful of the gentry, particularly the owners of the barn the Doctor wants information on.  The Doctor ripostes with ""I've met kings, emperors, megalomaniacs in my time.""  And Mace's shock at Nyssa and the Doctor's breaking into the barn owner's house is again 17th century protocol.  But Michael Robbins' plummy robust voice as well as his likeable character nearly makes him steal the show as Mace.
One reason why Tegan's among my least favourite companions is her bad temper.  When the Doctor misses her own time by a good three centuries, she yells ""Call yourself a Time Lord?  A broken clock keeps better time than you!  At least it's accurate twice a day which is more than you ever are!""  Later, he gets his own back when in response to how she's feeling, Tegan says ""Groggy, sore, and bad-tempered.""  He says, ""Good.  Almost your old self.""
The Terileptils justify their plans of conquest thus:  ""It's survival.  Just as these primitive kill lesser species to protect themselves, so I kill them.""  They also like war and say ""War is honorable...even on this planet it is considered so.""  The Doctor counters with ""Yet by your own admission, these people are still primitive.  What's your excuse?""  eliciting an angry growl from the Terileptil.  Designing the Terileptil marked the first use of animatronics in the series, used in making the mouth, lips and gills move.

The Visitation's always been a favourite of mine due to the way the story gradually unfolds.  One of Nyssa's more heroic moments come in during her task to convert the TARDIS's sonic booster coupled with a frequency accelerator to destroy the android.  And the story ends with an event Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary.  Look at the year: 1666.  What happened in London then?  (Rating: 5).
Black Orchid has the Doctor being mistaken for a doctor at nearby Guy's Hospital and expected at the manor of the Cranleighs for a cricket match, giving a ""perfectly ripping performance.""  Hey, the Doctor isn't wearing that cricketing outfit for nothing, and the montage that shows him batting, pitching no-hitters, and cries of ""Howzat?"" is a triumph.  However, who is the unknown man in beige trousers and brown shoes and guttural hiss who strangles a man at the beginning and who later infiltrates the Doctor's room?
A further surprise is that Nyssa is an identical twin of Ann Talbot, fiancee to Lord Cranleigh.  Sarah Sutton plays both Nyssa and Ann, and the latter's clever idea of having identical purple butterfly costumes at the masked charity.  However, the Cranleighs have a dark secret which blows open and sunders the festive atmosphere when Doctor is accused of murder by Ann.
One observation of the aristocracy arises when the Cranleighs try to figure out where Nyssa's from.  They think Worcestershire, and the identification of class to region, when they say Nyssa's lack of knowledge of Esher shows good taste is telling of the snobbery they exhibit.  The implied trust given to the aristocracy by the police is shown as the Doctor is disbelieved and Ann believed in her accusation.
One flaw is how the British police of 1925 know of police boxes when none existed back then.
Despite being a two-parter, Black Orchid works better than expected.  Adric and Nyssa's lack of understanding Earth culture is accompanied by Tegan feeling right at home, and in a good mood for once, even doing the Charleston at the ball.  (Rating: 4)  Overall rating, 4.5, rounded to 5.",1076284800,4,4606,4.896774193548387
768080,5,6304052936,"""The Visitation"" A first rate adventure for the TARDIS crew finds the Doctor (portrayed with excellence by Peter Davison)discovering an alien presence at a sensitive time in English history. Will our favorite Time Lord, along with his compantions and an open-minded actor/highwayman, be able to stop this menace? Collector's Note: This story features the last use of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver until the 1996 TV Movie! ""Black Orchid"" The Doctor remains in England, only travelling to the 1920's. While the Doctor enjoys a game of cricket, there are strange goings-on at Cranleigh House. A murder mystery ensues and the Doctor is the prime suspect!
Both of these episodes show the range of the Doctor Who series. While both utilize historical background, they have radically different approaches. One includes sci-fi elements, while another is a period costume drama. Neither suffers from these limitations and are suitable for the whole family.
The acting in the Doctor Who series is typically very good. The producers had to hire talented actors in order to detract from the occasionally rough special effects. Peter Davison brought an enthusiam and joy to the role of the Doctor that had been missing for a few years. Sarah Sutton is an excellent addition to the cast, playing a young scientist who is the last survivor of her world. She shows great range in ""Black Orchid"" where she takes on a second role. Janet Fielding offers her role of Tegan with great gusto, demonstrating a strength that is missing from many women's roles in family drama of the 80's. Matthew Waterhouse as the much-maligned Adric shows improvement, though he is certainly not adding much to the procedings. Watch for his amusing turn at the buffet in ""Black Orchid.""

'Black Orchid', the first truly historical Dr Who story since the  sixties, is filled with lavish sets, there is a genuine sense of mystery  and suspense, and the idea of Nyssa's double is a good one.",966643200,,433,5.028169014084507

It tries to fit in  historically with the 17th century events to explain away the Great Fire of  London etc which is does reasonably well (back to the old Hartnell days).  The character of Richard Mace really makes it though, he's a joy to watch  and clearly loving the role.
""Black Orchid"" however is a waste  of space designed to show Peter Davison playing cricket (woo hoo) and  general bimbling around in a period drama-bbc-style setting.

768180,5,6304052936,"The Visitation is a fun Doctor Who romp which somehow feels more like a straight historical than the historical with aliens that it really is. This is mostly due to some excellent use of location footage and superior set design. Also, it's set during the era of the black plague, and the alien (this time Tereieptils, an interesting if mostly poorly realized race) plot revolves quite specifically around taking advantage of the outbreak.

The story keeps a good pace, gives us one of the best, if not the very best, guest characters in Richard Mace, a big-talking actor-turned-highwayman, and it also manages to make better use of the overabundance of companions than other season 19 serials. It is by no means a top ten or top twenty story, but it is entirely solid and entertaining.

The only real flaw I find in The Visitation is that the Terlieptils themselves don't look very good. The costume is quite bulky and awkward to move about in. This is pretty common to Doctor Who, of course, but Michael Melia puts on such a good performance through the latex it's a shame he wasn't given something to allow more versatility. There is a new addition of some prototype animatronics, allowing the alien's eyes, lips, and ears to express and emote more, and this was a very welcome surprise. I was watching, thinking ""something's different"" and didn't realize until halfway through what it was.

The special features on the DVD are great. There's a cute piece on the cast revisiting the house used for exterior shots throughout the story. A fun watch, but there's more meat -- and laughs -- to be found in a piece with Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, and Mark Strickson revisitng TV Centre shortly before the end of its long life. For those interested, they provide a lot of anecdotes and insight into what day-to-day life was like for a regular on Doctor Who in the studio. Even having watched a lot of the documentaries from other DVDs, I still learned a lot about studio life. Also, it was extremely enjoyable because the trio was in high spirits and quick wit for the whole thing so it was EXTREMELY funny.

I'm a big fan of the big finish audios, so I was very excited to see there was a documentary covering them on this DVD. Fans of the audios will enjoy it quite a bit; it may not be much more than a curiosity for others. It was done well, and informative, but I wouldn't have minded another ten of fifteen minutes to show more of the process from script to CD as it were.

Overall, it's another solid Doctor Who release.",1393113600,2,2527,4.594235033259423
768181,5,6304052936,The Visitation is one of my all time favorite doctor who shows.

768184,3,6304052936,"I consider this serial to be middling, neither awful or exceptional. The story is fun enough by Classic Who standards, especially if you like the genre in which the Doctor turns out to have been involved in a major historic event (which I do). Peter Davison is charming in it, the plot hangs together (although episode 3 drags a bit as Nyssa takes seemingly forever to construct what amounts to a big vibrator) and the guest character of the actor/highwayman is amusing. Unfortunately, it's directed by Peter Moffatt, whose work on Doctor Who is completely uninspired. There are better Who stories, but it's worth seeing for fans of Davison's Doctor. However, if you already have the 2004 DVD release you probably don't need to buy this one. The commentary is the same. The new material consists of a visit by the main cast (Davison, Janet Fielding and Sarah Sutton, accompanied by Mark Strickson) to the location where the episode was filmed, and a field trip by the same group to BBC Television Centre, the building the BBC recently shut down. Unless you are a really big fan of this crew and 80 minutes of them walking around, telling jokes and doing their best to be charming is your idea of a great time, you don't need the extra disc. (I am a big enough fan that I'd probably watch Davison talk about anything for 80 minutes, but even I wouldn't have been happy with this if I already owned the 2004 version.) The final new item is a documentary on the Big Finish audio plays, which is informative if that's a topic of interest to you.

768279,4,6304052936,"The Doctor plans to take Tegan home, to 1981 Heathrow, where she was on her way to interview for an airline attendant position before she made a detour onto the TARDIS. With impeccable skill, the Doctor lands at Heathrow's exact position. With typical misadventure, though, he lands them in 1666, not 1981. The Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa and Adric stroll through the woods outside the TARDIS, only to be attacked by masked men. Our heroes are temporarily rescued by a well-spoken rogue, who introduces himself, ""A gentleman of the road, Madam. Richard Mace at your service.""

Mace tells them that their attackers are normally law-abiding villagers. But the plague has hit, and strangers possibly carrying the pestilence are run off. The plague came on the heels of a blazing comet a few weeks before. ""A portent of doom if ever I saw one,"" Mace tells them. ""It's aurora barely faded from the sky before the first local case was reported.""

The Doctor is puzzled, ""They're not due for a comet for years.""

We know more than the Doctor, though. In a prologue, we saw the comet split into two in the night sky. One part broke into bright fireworks. The other crashed to Earth, and shortly after, a nearby manor was attacked by a creature that couldn't be harmed by musket fire.

The foursome comes upon the same manor we saw in the prologue. When they find an interior wall scarred by a high energy beam and an abandoned power pack, they know that they aren't the only extraterrestrial visitors. Before long they meet the newcomer, a Terileptil, an intelligent lizard-like biped with a robot servant and bracelets that allow him to control hapless humans.

The Doctor offers to take the Terileptil home, but he isn't interested. He offers to give him pointers on living with humans, but the lizard isn't interested in that either. To put it bluntly, the Terileptil and his two fellow crash survivors have no intention of cohabiting with humans. How is the Doctor going to stop them from practicing genocide on his favorite planet?

""The Visitation"" first aired in February 1982 in 4 episodes. The story-line is not bad, and if you like Dr. Who's with a historical twist, you'll appreciate this one. What if the Doctor starts a fire in Pudding Lane? And what about those rats? I consider this an average serial. My opinion is influenced by my annoyance with the character of Tegan. Not even my affection for the pompous thespian-turned-highwayman, Richard Mace, can overcome that.

This is a review of the first release of ""The Visitation"" on DVD in 2004 (2005 for Region 1). There is one disc.

Extras on the 2004 DVD:
-- Commentary Track. The commentary track is part of Extra #4, Audio Options, but I like to cover it first. Commentators are Peter Davison (5th Doctor), Peter Moffatt (director, not to be confused with today's writer/showrunner, Peter Moffat), Janet Fielding (plays Tegan), Sarah Sutton (plays Nyssa) and Matthew Waterhouse (plays Adric). This was fun to listen to. There is a lot of humor. As they discuss what was filmed 24 years before, the memories are described as not ""not flooding back"" but ""oozing back"".
Waterhouse remembers Michael Robbins, who plays Richard Mace, constantly complaining about being reduced to playing on Dr. Who, in his opinion, ""the worst job he ever had - a load of rubbish"". That surprised me, because I thought Richard Mace must have been a fun character to play.
Bloopers: They talk about how impossible it would be to behead a kneeling man with a scythe, as shown in the village. But they don't mention what I think must be an earlier blooper. When the foursome first approach the manor house, doesn't the Doctor ring the doorbell before using the knocker?
1. ""Directing Who: Peter Moffatt"" (26 minutes, 2004) This interview with Moffatt includes lots of clips from the six Dr. Who series he directed. His first turn as Who director was on Tom Baker's ""State of Decay"" (premiered 1980, a favorite episode of mine). He went on to direct ""The Visitation"" (1982), ""Mawdryn Undead"" (1983), ""The Five Doctors"" (1983), ""The Twin Dilemma"" (1984) and ""The Two Doctors"" (1985). Moffatt mentions the trivia that Peter Davison's real name is Peter Moffett, a one-letter difference.
2. """"Scoring The Visitation"" (2004, 15 minutes) Composer Paddy Kingsland is interviewed by Mark Ayres. Kingsland composed the incidental music for 8 Dr. Who series. ""The Visitation"" was his 6th, and his first after starting his own company. Ayres composed for 4 Dr. Who serials, and also works with the restoration team at BBC.
3. ""Film Trims"" (2004, 6 minutes) This consists of unused takes or cut footage. The heroes' first meeting with Richard Mace took quite a few takes, as Robbins wasn't always spot on.

5. ""Writing A Final Visitation"" (2004, 10 minutes) Eric Saward takes about the differences between his vision and script and what ended up on the screen. He and producer John Nathan-Turner agreed to get rid of the sonic screwdriver. Aha, Saward gives us the reason why the robot is sparkley and glittered-up.

Also, the Doctor didn't get another sonic screwdriver until the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann. In 1996, John Nathan-Turner said, ""My feelings about this device were much the same as I had for K9.... It's all too convenient for the writers. The screwdriver can open any lock, except ones that the script editor, the producer or , indeed, some of the writers themselves, think should be excluded.... It had to go. I have no regrets.""

768280,4,6304052936,"The Doctor plans to take Tegan home, to 1981 Heathrow, where she was on her way to interview for an airline attendant position before she made a detour onto the TARDIS. With impeccable skill, the Doctor lands at Heathrow's exact position. With typical misadventure, though, he lands them in 1666, not 1981. The Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa and Adric stroll through the woods outside the TARDIS, only to be attacked by masked men. Our heroes are temporarily rescued by a well-spoken rogue, who introduces himself, ""A gentleman of the road, Madam. Richard Mace at your service.""

Mace tells them that their attackers are normally law-abiding villagers. But the plague has hit, and strangers possibly carrying the pestilence are run off. The plague came on the heels of a blazing comet a few weeks before. ""A portent of doom if ever I saw one,"" Mace tells them. ""It's aurora barely faded from the sky before the first local case was reported.""

The Doctor is puzzled, ""They're not due for a comet for years.""

We know more than the Doctor, though. In a prologue, we saw the comet split into two in the night sky. One part broke into bright fireworks. The other crashed to Earth, and shortly after, a nearby manor was attacked by a creature that couldn't be harmed by musket fire.

The foursome comes upon the same manor we saw in the prologue, and meet the Terileptil, an intelligent lizard-like biped with a robot servant and bracelets that allow him to control hapless humans.

The Doctor offers to take the Terileptil home, but he isn't interested. He offers to give the alien pointers on living with humans, but the lizard isn't interested in that either. To put it bluntly, the Terileptil and his two fellow crash survivors have no intention of cohabiting with humans. How is the Doctor going to stop them from practicing genocide on his favorite planet?

""The Visitation"" first aired in February 1982 in 4 episodes. The story-line is not bad, and if you like Dr. Who's with a historical twist, you'll appreciate this one. What if the Doctor starts a fire in Pudding Lane? And what about those rats? I consider this an average serial. My opinion is influenced by my annoyance with the character of Tegan. Not even my affection for the pompous thespian-turned-highwayman, Richard Mace, can overcome that.

This is a review of the 2013 Special Edition, to be released on a two-disc DVD set in May 2013. ""The Visitation"" was originally released on DVD in 2004 (2005 for Region 1), on one disc. For the Special Edition, both picture and sound have been digitally remastered.

Extras on the Special Edition:
1. Commentary Track (from the 2004 DVD) Commentators are Peter Davison (5th Doctor), Peter Moffatt (director, not to be confused with the current writer/showrunner, Steven Moffat), Janet Fielding (plays Tegan), Sarah Sutton (plays Nyssa) and Matthew Waterhouse (plays Adric). Though not as rousing as some Who commentaries, this was fun to listen to. There is a lot of humor. As they discuss what was filmed 24 years before, the memories are described as ""not flooding back"" but ""oozing back"".
Waterhouse remembers Michael Robbins, who plays Richard Mace, constantly complaining about being reduced to playing on Dr. Who, in his opinion, ""the worst job he ever had - a load of rubbish"". That surprised me, because I thought Richard Mace must have been a fun character to play.
Bloopers: They talk about how impossible it would be to behead a kneeling man with a scythe, as shown in the village. But they don't mention what I think must be an earlier blooper. When the foursome first approach the manor house, doesn't the Doctor ring the 1666 doorbell before using the knocker?
2. ""Grim Tales"" (new, 45 minutes) In this documentary, Mark Strickson, who plays 5th Doctor companion Vislor Turlough (beginning with ""Mawdryn Undead""), hosts Peter Davison, Janet Fielding and Sarah Sutton as they return to original filming locations. Also, other cast and crew members tell their memories of the story.
3. ""The Television Centre of the Universe: Part One"" (new, 32 minutes) Yvette Fielding, a presenter on the children's show, ""Blue Peter"", hosts a trip through the BBC Television Centre. Commentators include Peter Davison, Mark Strickson, Janet Fielding, Neville Withers (film traffic supervisor), Sue Hedden (assistant floor manager), Carolyn Perry and Joan Stribling (makeup artists), and Richard Marson (BBC producer and writer).
4. ""Doctor Forever! The Apocalypse Element"" (new, 27 minutes) This is part 3 of the 5-part ""Doctor Forever!"" documentary. This part, introduced by Ayesha Antoine, looks at the world of Doctor Who on audio, especially those who kept the Who universe alive after the show's cancellation in 1989. Commentators include Colin Baker (the 6th Doctor), William Russell (actor), Lisa Bowerman (actor), Russell T Davies (Dr. Who executive producer/head writer 2005-2011), Jason Haigh-Ellery, Gary Russell and Nicholas Briggs (executive producers for ""Big Finish""), David Richardson (producer for ""Big Finish""), Steve Cole (BBC range editor), Mark Gatiss (plays Richard Lazarus in the 2008 episode, ""The Lazarus Experiment"", and who's also written for seven different televised Doctors), Robert Shearman, Paul Cornell, Joseph Lidster and Justin Richards (writers) and Michael Stevens (AudioGO commissioning editor).
[In a comment to this review I've added where you can find the other parts of Doctor Forever.]
5. ""Film Trims"" (2004, 6 minutes) This consists of unused takes or cut footage. The heroes' first meeting with Richard Mace took quite a few takes, as Robbins wasn't always spot on.
6. ""Directing Who: Peter Moffatt"" (2004, 26 minutes) This interview with Moffatt includes lots of clips from the six Dr. Who series he directed. His first turn as Who director was on Tom Baker's ""State of Decay"" (premiered 1980, a favorite episode of mine). He went on to direct ""The Visitation"" (1982), ""Mawdryn Undead"" (1983), ""The Five Doctors"" (1983), ""The Twin Dilemma"" (1984) and ""The Two Doctors"" (1985). Moffatt mentions the trivia that Peter Davison's real name is Peter Moffett, a one-letter difference.
7. ""Writing A Final Visitation"" (2004, 10 minutes) Eric Saward takes about the differences between his vision and script and what ended up on the screen. He and producer John Nathan-Turner agreed to get rid of the sonic screwdriver. And, Aha!, Saward gives us the reason for the sparkley glittered-up robot, whose decoration had puzzled me.
8. ""Scoring The Visitation"" (2004, 15 minutes) Composer Paddy Kingsland is interviewed by Mark Ayres. Kingsland composed the incidental music for eight Dr. Who series. ""The Visitation"" was his 6th, and his first after starting his own company. Ayres also composed for Dr. Who, and works with the restoration team at BBC.
9.  Isolated Score (2004)
10. Subtitle Production Notes. BBC Dr. Who states that this extra is NEW, but the 2004 DVD does have an extra for watching the show with Information Text subtitles. It could be that they've redone the Info text.
I thought the original Info Text was good. It notes that the Doctor didn't get another sonic screwdriver until the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann. In 1996, John Nathan-Turner said, ""My feelings about this device were much the same as I had for K9.... It's all too convenient for the writers. The screwdriver can open any lock, except ones that the script editor, the producer or, indeed, some of the writers themselves, think should be excluded.... It had to go. I have no regrets.""

I never much cared for this episode although the 5th Doctor has always been my favorite.  The extras are nice but with various no longer ""missing"" episodes recently discovered, I'd rather see those as the extras.  Yes granted, fortunately none of the 5th Doctor stories are missing.  That said, the extras do look really good and I have already pre-ordered it.  Also,looking forward to new footage with Janet Fielding (Grim Tales).

768282,4,6304052936,"In ""The Visitation"" the Doctor goes to the time of the plagues, middle ages Europe. He meets a highwayman (robber) who is quite classy for a robber. The problem is that a small group of alien creatures crash landed on the  earth and now they are trying to take over the earth. I wouldn't say it's an outstanding show but it's interesting.

""Black Orchid"" is also interesting. This time the year is  about 1920 or something in England. The Doctor gets mistaken for another Doctor and gets invited to a large house with classy people. He plays cricket there. The problem is that someone gets murdered and the Doctor gets accused. I like it.",1317859200,,638,4.578947368421052

A popular time period for the Dr. Who series, it has the usual great stage actors in the supporting roles, such as the character Richard Mace the highwayman.  Nyssa, Tegan, and Adrick are excellent as the companions.  Once again, another alien has come to earth to take it over, eliminating humans in the process.  But when the doctor stumbles onto them, they decide they want the Tardis as well.  This episode is a must for the Dr. Who fan and just a fun movie for anyone.",1296950400,,536,4.428571428571429

This is similar to present-day Doctor Who, but different from the 4 to 6 half-hour episodes of most classic Who.  The second storyline here, ""Black Orchid"", is notable for placing the Fifth Doctor in the Edwardian time frame for which he always appears to be dressed anyay.  It's similar in tone and content to the recent Who episode featuring a fictionalized Agatha Christie in a similar setting.  This feels like a natural setting for the Doctor, and especially this one.  Enjoy the period costumes, and the bonus of having two complete storylines on one tape.",1280707200,,658,5.0
768342,5,6304052936,This particular story was one of the better storylines in the classic Doctor Who's in my opinion.

768345,4,6304052936,"Well now, it seems like ages since we've had a good old pseudo-historical tale on ""Doctor Who"" and it's about time! Indeed, combining as it does a straightforwardly good science fiction plot (crash-landed aliens on the lam terrorizing Earth) with a temporally exotic setting sometime in Earth's historical past (in this case, England in 1666), ""The Visitation"" is almost a textbook example of stories in this mold. This is especially so since the writer, Eric Saward, has thoroughly integrated into the plot several known historical events of the time period in question (the plague, the Great Fire of London) so that late 17th-century England is more than merely a fancy backdrop for a story that could happen anywhen. On top of that he expertly weaves many little references into the dialogue (the Puritans' closing down of the theaters, for example) and masterfully depicts popular attitudes and anxieties of the time--deftly avoiding the pitfall of having characters who think and act just like we do only in funny old clothes. But as for the latter, well, the BBC's indisputable expertise when it comes to period drama is taken full advantage here. Everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically like England in 1666, which strangely enough makes the reptilian criminals and their snazzy android that much more believable.

Unfortunately, the main flaw in this enjoyable and well-written storyline is its main characters. There just seems to be no real chemistry between the Doctor and his three companions here, and the companions themselves are dangerously close to becoming two-dimensional caricatures with each sort of instantiating a single mood to the exclusion of all else. For confrontational and dense we have Tegan, for annoyingly pouty and trouble-prone we have Adric, and for good and helpful we have Nyssa--whereas before, even with prior ""crowded"" Tardises, the companion or companions exhibited a range of these and other emotions and tendencies, depending. You know, the way main characters are supposed to. And it just doesn't help that Peter Davison's Doctor is, well, bland. Don't get me wrong, Davison is a fine actor, and he definitely brings a certain bumbling, boyish charm to this role, but somehow he seems to be a few ounces short of the kind of charisma the role demands. It's a bad sign when a supporting character (the thespian-turned-highwayman Richard Mace) starts upstaging him on this score. There are other problems too with the acting, the most damaging of which is the lackadaisical, ho-hum manner with which Nyssa sets about building the machine capable of destroying the android before it kills them all and jacks the Tardis--supposedly this is a desperate race against time, but none of that urgency is communicated to the viewer, and if she doesn't care, why should we?

Of course, if you look around hard enough you can always find flaws and faults to nitpick. That doesn't mean we should disengage our critical thinking nor turn a deaf ear to our impressions and opinions, of course, but it is best to keep it all in perspective. So while perhaps not the high-point of this long-running show's history, then, ""The Visitation"" is still a very intelligently-written and wonderfully-produced adventure, a cleverly fun pseudo-historical yarn in the tried-and true traditions of ""Doctor Who.""",1182470400,,3337,5.177777777777778

This episode was great, great, great, and really great.  You just can't say that this episode is great once and leave it at that.  Like I usually do, if you haven't purchased this movie I won't say too much. ( where's the drama if I tell ya everything?)  Its got a babe, actually two of them.  Tegan the hotty with a body... put simply.  And Nyssa the nice, sweet, intelligent girl, with a cute little figure.  Its got a historical earth setting; which I particularly like.  I believe its the 17th century.  Aliens; you just cant have a good episode without aliens. (you ever notice?)  -To ellaborate on the aliens briefly.-  The aliens are fairly cunning and actually surprising well made costume wise. One of the first DW episodes to feature animatronics on an alien costume.

The story also has Likeable Characters.  I gaurantee youll thoroughly enjoy the ""thespian"" character. He's laugh out loud funny for just about everything he says.  ""To be or not to be."" -doggonit.  Last but not least is the story.  It has a good plot though somewhat weak in some areas.  A standard Alien Takeover DW script.  All said and done. If you really like doctor who, or you couldn't give a rats fuzzy behind about DW(small hint on the story).  You'll still like this episode.

As the mystery unfolds, we learn that stranded reptilian-aliens, who are also escaped convicts, are accelerating the Plague in a typical half-baked fashion. As the newly regenerated 5th Doctor, played here by young Peter Davison, joins forces with Richard Mace, an actor turned highwayman.  Keeping in the classic mold of the series, there is lots of running, capture, escape and escaping again, but very little story to tie up the historical elements.

Significant story points: THE DEATH of the SONIC SCREWDRIVER

(don't worry kids, it'll be back, check out the new season one DVDs in July)

 With so many companions in the TARDIS a common flaw with the first Davison season is trying to find something for everyone to do, this is partly why Nyssa ends up in the TARDIS on a superfluous tech detail. Inspite of this I am still disappointed when Michael Robbins's Richard Mace remains behind, rather than add another mouth the feed (in the dialogue sense). The costumes are awkward, but performances bridge the gap.  Locations are ok here and Peter Davison is so charming on screen that this below average concept becomes a very watchable piece of Dr. Who history. Unfortunately, Davison is less charismatic on the DVD commentary, filled with pauses and no real revelations, making for a  is a less than interesting extra.",1137628800,5,1479,4.987804878048781
768348,3,6304052936,"If someone were to ask you to show them not the very best historical Doctor Who and also not the worst historical Doctor Who but the most average you could think of I'd recommend showing them this one. In fact it's not just average for historical Doctor Who is average for any type of Doctor Who story.

Not that average is bad mind you it's just that with with so few Peter Davison era Doctor Who episodes avalible on DVD I wonder why they picked this one. So far all the episodes on DVD of the Davison era have been important episodes. For example Earthshock with the Cybermen and death of Adric or Caves of Androzani not only featuring Davison's finial apearence but also one of the best written, best acted,best written episodes ever. But who knows maybe that was the point to show something average.

The plot the Tardis lands on Earth in 1666 during the plague. There are aliens trapped on Earth they decide to wipe out all humanity so all three of them can have Earth to themselves. The Doctor offers to help them go some place else but they reject his offer. The doctor must stop the aliens evil plan to wipe out humanity with a geneticaly altered plague virus before it's too late! We've seen this sort of thing before in fact it remined me a bit of the Time Warrior from the Pertwee era but it's not as good. If this story suffers from something it's from being too simple and the writter of the episode Eric Saward agrees that it is a simple story in an excellent interview on the DVD extras.

Now on to the extras and on that score the disk gets a 5 star rating the stand out features are. A funny and very informative audio comentary track with Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, Matthew Waterhouse and director Peter Moffat. An interview with Peter Moffat about directing Doctor Who over the years. A interview with the episode writer Eric Saward. As well as an interview with the episodes composer. Honestly I really don't feel you can ask for much more BBC really went to town on this disk and I only mentioned some of what I think are the more interesting features. The episode may be average but the extras are far above average even by the high standards the BBC has set with other D.W. disks.

In conclusion this is a solid if not truely great episode. It's a good time but just not the best of the Davison era it is in a word average.",1116115200,8,2351,4.385321100917431
768349,3,6304052936,"I never have been a huge fan of Doctor Who episodes set in the Middle Ages on up to the pre-industrial era.  This episode does have all the typical characteristics of an average to good Doctor Who story at least on paper.  However, the weakness of the 17th century setting dampens a lot of that.  The same story set in a different era might have been more exciting.  The background characters from that historical period are bland by nature and hard to bring to life by even an exceptional actor.  It is also interesting that the writers went to all the trouble of pointing out that we are in the era of the black death plague, but we never are really shown any of the suffering caused by the plague.  The best thing that comes out of the story being set in this time period is the Doctor starting the Great Fire Of London of 1666.

The Terileptils are great!  The fact that they are escaped convicts and that they are developing an augmented form of black death plague virus that will wipe out all human life on Earth so that they can have the whole planet to themselves is classic Who and it is great!

In summary I would say that this Doctor Who story is adequate for the devoted fan with great aliens and great genocide themes.  However, I would not describe the story as a must-see for the novice.  This is average Doctor Who fare.",1114560000,2,1336,4.346774193548387

The TARDIS gets the location right but the year wrong. The year is 1666 and the plague is raging throughout England. If that wasn't bad enough, a ""comet"" crashed recently which the locals took as a sign of doom. They are quite right of course, because it was actually a spaceship. The Doctor wants to help the stranded aliens get back to their home world. Those aliens, the Terileptils, have other plans, the typical enslaving and/or wiping out humanity so they can have the Earth to themselves.

The show has the usual antics--kidnappings and escapes, chasing good guys or bad guys, building a science-y weapon, bantering between the Doctor and the companions (two others are on board in addition to Tegan). A fun addition is Richard Mace (Michael Robbins), a highwayman who used to be an actor before the plague made theater-going less appealing. He helps out the Doctor with his highwayman skills (picking locks and shooting pistols, that kind of thing) and provides some extra comic relief. The aliens are typical Doctor Who baddies, though at least they are imaginative enough to dress up their android as Death to scare the locals away.

It has also a landmark change which would effect the rest of the classic series. However, the pacing drags the story down. There's a lot of filler in this story with pointless scenes making this story crawl. Add to that the fact that while this is the fourth story of Season 19, it was actually the second filmed and the cast doesn't quite have the chemistry right even though it does do a better job than many other stories in giving each companion something to do, you have an okay but flawed story that doesn't live up to the best of the series or the best of the Fifth Doctor for that matter.
