8320287,3,B001M0NIZG,"I've followed OJ online for a while now and was psyched to find all the episodes collected on a DVD. Anthony's writing style is smart & edgy with the right balance of laugh-out-loud funny and jokes that dawn on you two minutes later. He manages to slip wry social & political observations in the mix without missing a beat.

The animation is pretty simplistic but it suits the style of the comedy just fine. Terence Anthony (creator) said in an interview that he's really a writer and learned to use Flash to bring his OJ scripts to life. I'd love to see where this toon would go if Anthony were paired with a professional animator. I could see OJ continuing as an underground phenomenon or getting picked up by a network and expanded.

Even if you've seen the episodes online (they are not all available on the website anymore), the extras on the DVD are well worth the purchase. The web cam episode with Orlando and the 2-Bit video are HILARIOUS!!",1229558400,,949,4.543859649122807

Terence Anthony has raised the bar for hip (hop) edgy, underground, flat-out hilarious animated series. Laugh-out-loud antics, cool packaging, & great value - don't sleep on this one!",1229040000,,277,5.043478260869565
8320289,5,B001M0NIZG,"I heard about this animated series from a group of friends. They said it was ""cutting-edge"", ""inspiring"", ""motivational"", and ""the funniest thing they've ever seen"".

After watching it, I couldn't put the DVD down. The characters are awesome. And Bumpie coming back as a 'roach'...hilarious!!!

Eveyone should buy this for their collection.",1228176000,,340,5.519230769230769
