5159524,4,B008G590UM,"As an American citizen, it is painful to acknowledge the substitution of our founding father's moral philosophy of liberty with one rooted in a domineering oppression of humanity. Such is the consequence of the inexorable march of the military-industrial complex, that danger Eisenhower strongly cautioned the U.S. about in his farewell address in 1961.

While this documentary is largely the product of leftist ideologues, the fact is they are right in this context and they shoot (mostly) straight.  Some will use the escape hatch of objectivity to deny the well presented facts. We have become a country afraid to take it's moral inventory -- afraid to see and take notice of the truth. Instead we choose to lie to ourselves, to say we are some exceptional force of good in the world. As the recent election politics have demonstrated, our collective notions of truth have decayed to a relativist, amorphous concept of convenient interpretation of facts. That must change.

George Orwell best explains this dichotomy in Nineteen Eighty-Four with his concept of Doublethink:

""To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again...""",1359158400,10,1636,5.116104868913857

5159551,5,B008G590UM,"This is about the hundreds of U.S. military bases scattered across the globe. According to various sources the U.S. has anywhere from 662 bases in 38 countries (from the Wikipedia article) to something like 700 (according to this documentary) to 800 (according to an article in The Nation Magazine). The question is why?

Its been 71 years since the end of World War II and yet there are still hundreds of bases in Germany and Japan. The documentary shows protests against some of these bases. In particular Kadena Air Base in Okinawa faces daily protests. Japanese citizens claim that the land on which the base stands belongs to them and should be returned. Of course Osama bin Laden used the presence of U.S. military bases on Islamic lands as justification for the murders of thousands of Americans. The documentary basically asks how would we feel if there were foreign military bases in the United States?

It is easy to say, well, we didn't suffer unconditional surrender, and yes Japan attacked the U.S., etc., but that was then. This is now, and Germany and Japan are our allies. Regardless of how other people feel about the bases the question we should ask ourselvesand its a question this documentary asksis isn't this a great waste of taxpayer money?

Directors Thomas Fazi and Enrico Parenti use interviews and film footage to show what a waste these bases are and why there are continuing to be maintained. Naturally Eisenhowers famous warning about the industrial military complex comes into play. In short, this production argues that the bases are not only a waste of money but do not add to our national security. Indeed David Vine in his article in The Nation claims the bases are doing us more harm than good.

Personally I agree that the bases add little to our national security. Some bases, such as the one in the middle of the Indian Ocean and others in the Middle East may allow us to respond quickly to terrorists and pirates. This is good since it facilitates global trade which is beneficial to the U.S. But why should the price be so high, and why shouldnt other countries pay more for their defense and keeping the trade routes open? Good questions, but the fact remains that, as this interesting and compelling documentary makes clear, we have far, far too many bases overseas at a cost well beyond their value. One could say its time to bring the troops home. One would guess that we could be just as safe with perhaps a quarter of the bases. As the headline in The Nation puts it: The United States Probably Has More Foreign Military Bases Than Any Other People, Nation, or Empire in History.

The importance of this documentary is in the fact that the vast majority of Americans have no idea how great and expensive is our military presence globally. This should open some eyes. Spend 76 minutes watching this documentary and decide for yourself: Do we really to spend an estimated $156 billion or more a year while incurring some serious animosity and ill will?

The military presence is clearly needed for defense and strategic purposes in several locations. But the magnitude of the forces installed makes you think about how much is really needed and how much is just a response to false threats, created only to ensure millions of taxpayer's dollars go into the pockets of a few corporations, which just show lack of respect for the life and bravery of the men and women who decide to voluntarily serve.",1441238400,3,656,4.71304347826087
5159556,2,B008G590UM,"I'd have given this 3 stars because it was well produced and pretty engaging. Well made documentaries use music and the narrative voice to engage the viewer, and this one did that very well. But I cannot endorse it's pretense of exposing some closely guarded secret as part of some vast right wing conspiracy. They fell short on offering any pragmatic argument that the world wide presence of U.S. military forces is some great state secret.

I spent 6 years in the U.S. Army and 3 years of active duty with the reserves. Millions of American men and women like myself have served in the U.S. military since the end of WWII. I became familiar with many military installations that my fellow soldiers had been to. And the same is true of every person who ever spent time on active duty with any branch of the U.S. military. The thinking at the end of WWII, that we were drawn into with few options, was that Americans didn't want this to happen again. The cost in American blood was too high. So establishing a military presence, either large bases or small detachments, in every country receptive to U.S. troop presence that served our national security interests was a good thing. Having emerged from WWII as a the most militarily and industrially powerful nation, it was, and still is our role to keep the peace. Cliche as it may sound, the best offense is a strong defense. And being able to respond to potential hot spots around the world on short notice could dissuade a potential malevolent force against the U.S. or one of our allies to have second thoughts. It is the ability to keep small engagements from become full scale wars. This is and has been public knowledge for those who bothered to look, but most people don't care about such things. Over the past few decades, the number of American military installations around the world has been shirking. In South Korea alone, we have half the number of troops there as we did in the early 70's when I was stationed there. More and more  U.S. military bases are being turned back over to the South Korean government as U.S. troops are being moved away from the DMZ as South Korean troops take over responsibility for these areas.

Bottom line is, there is nothing new hear. Just readily available information spun to look ominous to those who are always looking for a boogie man around the corner.",1440288000,3,2356,4.631578947368421

5159575,1,B008G590UM,"I have to give this documentary a 1 star review principality because of just a few things.  And, those things revolve more around how they were presented than what was actually presented.
Prime example.  They mentioned that two little girls were run over by a tank n Okinawa and that the locals were not allowed to try the crew.  I was on Oki albeit several years before this tragedy, but the SOFA was very specific and I doubt it has changed much.  In clear cases of accidents, the Prefecture insisted that that service person be sent anywhere except Japan almost immediately.
What we were told that meant though was very dependent on 'clear case of accident.'  For instance, drinking and driving and running over something or someone was not considered accidental according to the local laws in which case the Okinawan government had the right to hold and try anyone under those circumstances.
Anyway, in the above case, two little girls being run over by a tank was probably ruled a clear accident.  It's sad, I wish it would not have happened, but I really don't see that being anything other than an accident.

Beyond that, they appeared to want to echo Ike concerning the MEC and that is where I had the biggest problem.  I can come up with better rationale than a few disgruntled farmers and fishermen displaced.  Trying to blame it on oil is and old and tired argument.  In fact, none of the reasons they cited couldn't be offset by just as many arguments that would support the way things are.  That might be my biggest issue actually.  Hatchet jobs seldom succeed in much.

They would have served themselves and the intent of pointing out the MEC better had the broadened the scoop of the Roman Empire analogies and just focused on that really.  But, I felt from the start there was a slightly hidden agenda here that amounted to trying to weaken America.

Most of my extended family still lives in Okinawa. My cousin married an American. I spent a year in Afghanistan and I've been to Kadena AFB so I know a little about living in a base overseas.

Philosophically, I disagree with Chomsky on many, many points, but the reason why I keep reading him is because I like being challenged to think.  And so I ask myself, did this film make me think? To that I'd say yes but you must watch it with a critical mind.

The argument set forth is that the American Empire builds bases to project force and this displaces locals, destroys the environment, and causes more war. So the interview of Okinawans has valiant protesters mourning the loss of life and land. The crying children was an especially emotional scene. But it's all extremely one-sided which is fine as long you understand this kind of film is supposed to be.

The portrayal of base life is a bit less focused. Larger bases definitely have BXs, gyms, and food courts with BK. Bagram is like that in Afghanistan. But the FOB I was assigned to didn't have any of that. If the point was to show that bases were being setup for permanent occupation and how that's a bad thing, it sort of missed the point. I also found that it humanized the military, so instead of being a faceless, evil military industrial complex, it became a young soldier who likes Burger King and loves his country.

The biggest critique I have of Chomsky is that while he's extremely good at pointing out the problems, I haven't read any convincing solutions by him. It's the criticism I have for this film too. So say you protest and get all the bases shut down and cut our ""standing army"" down to pre-WW2 levels. We give up the doctrine of Force Projection and adopt a policy of military isolationism (which is implied in base shutdowns).

That isn't peace, that's a power vacuum. All it takes is another aggressor(who hasn't read Chomsky) to come along and you've got war again.",1395187200,45,2165,4.510204081632653

Honestly, part of what makes us American is the fact that we (used to) have the testicular fortitude to disagree with, stand up against, and take power back from, our leaders and governments....that was the intention of the founding fathers, not this blind obedience to the policies of their leaders and loyalty to ones rulers (instead of ones' countrymen) that people today pass off as ""patriotism"".

Also, the bases piss off the locals.""

The most likely reason for the existence of the bases is to secure trade routs which, if interrupted, would likely have severe consequences for the American & world economy. But this is barely discussed, and there is zero debate over whether the bases are needed or if the cost of the bases is worth securing such trade routs.

We need these armies because we have to assume that if the rest of the world was in our position then IT would be as merciless as us. To that point I am ashamed to say that that MAY be true. Because humans can be so cruel.

We are the ones with most of the weapons and cruelty is part of having them, using them. With great power comes great responsibility. Thus the responsible thing to do is first be aware of the injustices and second making the citizens of these powerful states AWARE of the cruelties. SO THEY CAN STOP THEM, LIMIT THEM and make them illegal! Instead so many Americans sit back in all their comfort and just call it a lie. THAT ITSELF IS A LIE. Not only is it a lie but it's actually helping it continue. That makes the person saying the unresearched claims an accomplice.

This film is not only deliberately one-sided in its negative representation of the United States military, but woefully lacking in context.  It employs unrelated data, paired with scary music, cherry-picked interviews, and the biased opinions of ""experts"" in an intentional effort to mislead the viewer.

The video's argument hinges on the idea that correlation equals causation, and supposes that the threats America faces are the sole result of our large military presence.  It conspicuously ignores the countless ways the US military has benefited regions by bringing peace, stability, economic aid, and infrastructure.  The viewer is expected to believe that failing to protect US interests abroad (along with the lives of innocent people around the world) by strategically positioning our military forces, is morally superior to spending money or stepping on a few toes to protect lives.  It paints military service members as menaces to society who live lavish lifestyles and commit crimes with impunity - which could not be further from the truth.

This shameless propaganda piece maligns the reputation of one of the nation's oldest and most honorable institutions.  The truth is that our foreign policy isn't always great.  There have been times where leaders have misused the military.  But that doesn't mean we don't need the military - we maintain a strong military because when you DO need the military, you simply don't have time to train a brand new force.
