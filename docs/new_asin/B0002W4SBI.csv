2128017,3,B0002W4SBI,"Computer generated effects are becoming less expensive, which means that we are finally seeing something that has been in short supply for decades-- B Monster Movies.  Although the first crop has been lame even by the standards of the creature features of yesteryear ('Python' anyone?  How about 'Boa 2'?) this movie shows there's still life in the old school monster flick.

'Frankenfish' is basically a 1950's creature-on-the-loose movie, like 'The Monster That Challenged the World' or 'The Giant Gila Monster', but with modern CGI and gory violence.  The plot is very familiar and the acting just about functional, but there is suspence, action and a memorable monster.

The cost of CGI insures that the Terrifying Trout of the title is seen in swift bursts, and that it isn't the most convincing beast ever put on screen, but the filmakers deserve credit for making it one of the most unique movie monsters in years.  It's a big ugly fish, basically a bloated overgrown bass with a fiendish hankering for human flesh.  It does the expected 'Jaws'-style underwater stalking of film's hapless characters.  But it also leaps out of the water and pursues the cast on dry land.  This manages to be both scary and oddly realistic, as the slimy, ungainly fish flops heavily after his prey with hungry determination.  You've never seen a monster quite like this before and creature fans owe it to themselves to check it out.",1097971200,3,1421,4.932773109243698
2128018,3,B0002W4SBI,"Look folks, this movie is an original Sci-Fi channel production.  What can you really expect from it?  Sci-Fi touted this movie for a couple of weeks before they premiered it over the weekend of Oct. 9.  It has the typical cheesey Sci-Fi channel special effects and second-rate story.  None of the actors involved have done anything significant to date.  They didn't even try to get a has-been like Lorenzo Lamas or Dean Cain to star in this one, so don't hammer it for being a bad flick.

I give it three stars for the simple fact that it put out exactly what I expected from a Sci-Fi pics original.  It killed a couple of hours of my time on a rainy weekend.  Sure, the fish looked fake and even though this supposedly took place in Louisiana waters, there is a ""county"" sheriff.  If you know anything of Louisiana, you should at least know that we don't have counties.  We have parishes.  I don't think that this film does anything to put down Louisiana citizens for the simple fact that the accents are so bad that you can't tell where any of these people are from.

The basic story is this:  An exotic fish collector/hunter gets a shipment of mutated snakehead fish shipped to him from China.  A hurricane blew the ship off course and it winds up somewhere in the bayous on the coast of what is supposed to be Louisiana.  Native fish get scarce, then native people get scarce.  A coroner-type and a Fish and Wildlife fed get shipped down to check out the situation.  Standard aquatic-creature feature fare follows.  People ""get in the water,"" ""get too close to the water,"" ""get tossed overboard,"" etc.  Finally, our heroes manage to survive.....or do they?

Rent this movie once, and you'll get your fill.  This isn't the catch of the day, but if you have nothing to do, it'll kill your time just fine.  Just keep in mind that Sci-Fi channel had a hand in this, and you won't be too let down when it's all over.",1097452800,3,1916,4.476878612716763

2128030,5,B0002W4SBI,"I've lost track of the number of times I've watched this movie since I bought it.  When I'm in the mood to watch a monster movie it's one of my first considerations.  The story is fundamental for its type, after a fisherman is killed, medical examiner Sam Rivers (Tory Kittles) is sent to the bayou to investigate his mysterious death.  To aid him in this endeavor is a wildlife and fisheries expert Mary Callahan (China Chow).  They head to a small enclave of houseboats way out in the middle of nowhere.  From there they are soon directed to a strange boat stranded not far from the area, it's filled with dead people.  While nosing around, they accidently set off a homing signal alerting a wealthy hunter.  All parties converge on the houseboats, including some unforeseen guests in the form of genetically engineered snakeheads from China.  From that point on, it's kill or be killed, eat, or be eaten.

I appreciated the serious tone they took with this movie; they could have easily gone the simple route and just tried to make a joke of it.  As it is, there's enough humor throughout and a few good jump scares.  The `fish' in question are rather grotesque, large, and not a little sneaky.  I enjoyed all the characters, especially the whiny (sort of a boyfriend but not) Dan (Matthew Rauch).  His comeuppance is well deserved.

Is this the best monster fish movie ever made, no.  But it is entertaining and provides the perfect diversion if you're in the mood for a freakish fish flick.  I'm glad I stumbled on it all those years ago.",1408060800,,1543,4.617647058823529

2128044,3,B0002W4SBI,"It takes a while for the action in Frankenfish (2004) to get going, but when the monster fishes finally arrive on the scene, the stage is set for the total destruction of a small settlement deep in the bayou.  There isn't a lot to the backstory regarding how the fish got loose, and what is revealed is rather clichd and silly, but the special effects are decent, and hold up pretty well, making for some fun action sequences featuring the hungry fish.  With some decent gore and some unexpected kills, Frankenfish is a slightly better than average creature feature.

When a fisherman turns up dead with some unusual wounds, medical examiner Sam Rivers (Tory Kittles), and wildlife agent Mary Callahan (China Chow), board a small boat, and head deep into the Louisiana bayou to investigate the crime scene.  Approaching their destination, they encounter Elmer (Muse Watson), a fisherman who guides them to a group of three houseboats, one which was the home of the dead man.

The investigators meet Gloria (Donna Biscoe) the dead man's widow, his daughter Eliza (K.D. Aubert), and her lawyer boyfriend Dan (Matthew Rauch).  Gloria tells the outsiders about a boat that mysteriously appeared in the swamp after a hurricane, and Elmer takes them there in his boat.  Searching the abandoned boat, they find a huge fish scale, and unknowingly set off a tracking device that notifies the boat's owner where his lost craft is.  Unfortunately, as they are about to leave, Elmer falls into the water, and the old man is attacked, dragged, and killed by something very large.  Sam and Mary return to the settlement with the bad news, but the worst is yet to come, as the deadly fish have followed them, and begin to attack, quickly destroying all useable boats, and chomping up some of the residents.

Jeff (Tomas Arana), the owner of the abandoned boat, is some kind of whacky big game hunter who had been importing the gigantic genetically engineered fish to be hunted as game.  He gathers together a group, and heads into the swamp to try and recover his fish.  Cruising through the swamp on an airboat, Jeff reaches his boat, but finds no signs of his fish.  An explosion at the settlement however, has the hunter headed that way.

With a paper thin backstory and passable acting, Frankenfish isn't terribly deep or polished, but directed by Mark Dippe, a specialist in visual effects who has worked on some A-list flims, it is an entertaining b-movie with a nice mix of CG and practical effects.  There are a couple of cool kills, including one that is a real head turner.  For a creature feature that is a bit better than Sy Fy Channel quality, you might want to give this one a look.",1316822400,,2681,4.733333333333333

2128046,4,B0002W4SBI,"From the rather lame front cover picture, which was totally expected of a movie like this, I was expecting a lame, boring, and flawed filled movie. Flawed filled as in obvious flaws here and there that would totally annoy me as the viewer with somewhat of a brain.

However, to keep it short, I liked the movie!

I liked how there was a black man as a main character because usually in movies like this or rather movies like these are usually filled with white people as main characters. No racism intended, I'm just being straight forward. It's refreshing to see a black guy play the part. The movie was also pleasing due to the fact that there were lots of action scenes.

However, even though I gave this movie 4 stars due to liking it, it's honestly around a 2-3 stars. The monster fish looks somewhat believable but not completely, but I didn't concentrate too hard on there.

Oh, I really loved the lawyer ""ex bf"". I sorta disliked him at the beginning but he was actually very funny and I found him entertaining to watch. He became a likable character. I definitely wouldn't expect that kind of woman to live in such an isolated area, she was pretty hott.

2128047,4,B0002W4SBI,"With the title having ""Franken"" in it and with a black man on the cover, I was all set for a bad black horror movie on the order of ""Black Frankenstein."" I was wrong. The movie was quite good as far as B horrors go. Toby Kittles (Denzel Washington light) plays a medical examiner trying to figure out which critter is killing the people in the swamp or ""Swamp Rats"" as the movie refers to them. He is accompanied by the beautiful China Chow, who we do see in that bikini top on the cover. They talk to a community of people who live on houseboats, including a pair of nudists (nudity and one simulated oral sex scene). With the help of Elmer (best accent in the movie) they locate a large vessel that had appeared suddenly during the last hurricane. It seems the American hunters had the Chinese genetically engineer a fish that could hunt them while they hunt it. (Not much for clever, but great for testosterone.) When one person is killed by super-fish, they opt to hold up in the houseboats until morning, then go for help, but the fish have other ideas.

 The acting was far better than most horror movies. The plot, well you can judge that for yourself. The fish aren't as big as seen on the cover.",1295740800,,1204,4.370535714285714
2128048,5,B0002W4SBI,The movie was on time and in excelllent shape It is one of my all time favorites Thank you  for being promt,1286409600,,107,3.8636363636363638
2128049,2,B0002W4SBI,"The prefix ""Franken-"" is the sweatpants of movie names.  As Seinfeld put it: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweatpants? You're telling the world: ""I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."" See Frankenstein, Frank-N-Furter.

But that's just a first impression based on a monster movie with a ridiculous name.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction, because the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has a page on ""Frankenfish.""  That's right, the U.S. government uses the same name as this horror movie, so it can't all be bad.

Why is the northern snakehead called Frankenfish? Because it's a non-native predator that can breathe air, walk on land, breeds like crazy, and is highly aggressive.  The giant snakehead grows up to three feet and is rumored to have killed children.  This evil reputation fanned into hysteria when the northern snakehead was discovered in American waters in 2002.  If all this screams monster movie, you and director Mark A. Z. Dippe have a lot in common.

Dippe doesn't really care to elaborate on why monstrous Frankenfish exist in this movie, because it is assumed that the Frankenfish crisis of 2002 was still fresh in 2004.  Which is a bit of a stretch, but then these movies capitalize on our collective fears of the moment. Frakenfish's plot goes off (or dives into?) the deep end, with some nonsense about a big game hunter wanting to hunt genetically mutated fish, just like we genetically engineer salmon.  Of course, if we could indeed apply the same technology to make giant salmon we might have solved world hunger...

But I digress. I used to work in Michigan State University's rural sociology department and the consequences of genetically engineered fish escaping their breeding ponds are no joke.  Frankenfish' peculiar nature does beg the question: are fisheries prepared to contain fish that can get up and walk out?

No, according to Frankenfish.  No, they are not, and as a result three genetically mutated monsters are loose somewhere in the Louisiana swampland. Cue the screaming and the bleeding and the fish eating...or being eaten, in one case. The characters are interchangeable stereotypes: the stoner, the hot chick, the love interest, the superstitious lady, the surly guy out for revenge, the jaded hunter, the wisecracking moron, and some ""red shirts"" with no lines who are obviously there to die.  Hot chicks flirt. Bad guys use our heroes as bait.  And the sarcastic boyfriend eventually bites it.

Frankenfish has a tenuous grip on reality. At one point, through a convoluted series of events, the brother of one of the victim's kills one of the Frankenfish, cooks its heart, eats it, is eaten in turn, his boat is set ablaze, which ignites a propane tank, which fires a shotgun, which kills one of the characters, whereupon the boat explodes hurling another character high into the air where she lands unharmed in the water.  Only in Frankenfish can one character die from a rubegoldbergian series of events while another survive certain doom.

What's striking is the diversity.  Not the diversity of fish, which despite the amazing features of snakeheads act a lot like any other fish monster, but of the cast, which includes an Asian lesbian, an African-American male lead and female love interest, and a lot of dumb white people. Frankenfish has its own goofy charm.

If you happen to find yourself lounging around in sweatpants...sit back, make yourself comfortable, and enjoy a movie about giant genetically engineered man-eating fish monsters from China.",1282780800,,3604,5.011744966442953

2128051,3,B0002W4SBI,"""From the director of Spawn""!!  Boy if that doesn't have you throwing this one in your shopping cart, I'm not sure what else will.
Frankenfish has a medical examiner and a wildlife specialist(hot of course) going deep into the Louisiana bayou to investigate mysterious deaths, and find themselves in a standoff, along with a small group of folks in houseboats(the young females all hot of course), against large mutant fish.
Not an original bone in it's body, but is certainly fun if you like this kinda thing.  And considering the amount of these kinds of films on the market these days, many folks like this kind of thing.
Strangely enough, I was expecting something a tad different from a film called ""Frankenfish"".  Maybe something a bit more tongue in cheek or schlocky.  Frankenfish is schlocky no doubt, but it actually plays it more straight faced than you'd think a movie called ""Frankenfish"" would.
Like I said, there's a ton of these kinds of films out there, and if you dig em, Frankenfish delivers the expected ""goods"" of this subgenre.",1277596800,,1049,4.843575418994414
2128052,3,B0002W4SBI,"Although the plot is indistinguishable from countless other killer animal flicks, FRANKENFISH is a step above the usual direct-to-video releases. Sam Rivers is charged with uncovering the truth behind a recent rash of animal attacks in the Louisiana bayou, which brings him and a group of locals face to face with the genetically-engineered monstrosities swimming just beneath the surface! The production qualities far exceed the subject matter here, as it offers competent filming along with its mid-budget sets, action, and gore. Despite their purely digital creation, enough effort has been made to allow the creatures to manipulate and interact with their environments, bringing with them some sense of believability. The FX team has also done a solid job in giving the fish a unique and realistic design, while the make-up artists have managed to squeeze in a bloody decapitation, countless bisections, and a fisherman frappe through the blades of an air boat. FRANKENFISH won't be winning any awards in the near future, but it is one of the better films of its kind to hit the DVD market in recent years.

This film was actually based, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakehead-Terror/dp/B001NFNFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakehead Terror</a>, on the snakehead fish incident in a pond in Maryland. The snakehead fish is real, and it is voracious, but the snakehead creatures in Frankenfish aren't.

The movie's plot, as interesting as it sounds, looks great at first glance: A hunter who would like to hunt and kill something really dangerous and life-threatening breeds three genetically altered snakehead fish in Asia, and has ships to him in America. But when they are being shipped down the Louisiana bayou, something goes wrong, and they escape the ship, loose deep inside the bayou...Now a medical examiner investigating the bodies the fish leave behind is trapped in a small houseboat community, and must, along with the community, find a way out.

The plot had so much going for it, yet the movie plods along for most of its gory and blood-soaked 84 minute running-time. The acting is quite good though, and is much better than normal SciFi channel fare.

The things that set the movie the movie back are A) the clich&eacute;d characters, B) at times, the horrible and silly dialogue, and, C) you don't really see the fish. I know a horror technique is to keep the monster in shadow, but in this case, the fish is almost never seen, not till the last part of the movie. And after I expected much more, the conclusion felt rushed, and wasn't worth the time I spent wondering what the fish looked like. Seriously, the cover of the DVD shows more of the fish than most of the actual movie!

But Frankenfish still tries to be good and scary, and at times the creepy level is pretty high. The CGI effects are that bad either, and for a SciFi film that's a plus. I just want to see the fish! More man-eating fishes, please!!!",1239408000,,2302,5.736070381231672
2128055,4,B0002W4SBI,"FRANKINFISH

Have you ever seen a movie and thought ""man that was a far out there concept"", and then thought ""hey that was actually entertaining"". Well if you have ever thought that then chances are you were talking about this flick right here. This movie despite having a funny yet horrible name is just one of those fun out there type of creature features in the same vein as ""Lake Placid"" [the first one]. I remember seeing this movie the first time on the Sci-Fi Channel and thinking man I have to buy that.

The story is your basic loose genetically enhanced animal that tends to have a taste for human flesh. To be more precise it is about a medical researcher and a biologist investigating a situation out in Louisiana after a body turns up mutilated in the swamp. Now as much as that sounds like Lake Placid it really is not, but this could have been a better sequel perhaps then the one that came out. Once out in the swamp they meet the people who live on the water, and well the fish start their attack at that point. From that point on this movie kicks into high gear and I really mean that, the kills in this movie are awesome. There is even a point in this movie that I think is the best death by shot gun ever, or at least the most surprising. This is not just one of those over the top b movies it actually makes sense at times, even the acting is for the most part up to par.

Tory Kittles is pretty good in the lead role and makes for a believable hero, though at times he seems to be trying to hard. K.D. Aubert is just as good as the ""please rescue me"" damsel in distress, but she is quick to turn on her actual boyfriend for the lead. China Chow is on the same level as the previous two as she gives a pretty decent performance, and is involved in one of the best moments of the movie. Matthew Rauch is by far the most entertaining actor on the film as the egotistical cowardly city boy, he is actually the most believable person on the entire film. His character is hilarious and is really how most people would react, absolutely the MVP of the movie. Donna Biscoe, Tomas Arana, Mark Boone Junior, Reggie Lee all deliver great performances as well.

The movie takes place in the deep Louisiana swamp where people tether their houseboats and live amongst the gators and mosquitoes. Far, far away from civilization. They live off the swamp.

A boat has run aground due to its crew being eaten by the genetically modified fish. The reason why they were being taken to a particular area will reveal itself towards the middle of the movie. The fish are very hungry for gators and humans. They also become increasingly smart too.

It's like the Anaconda movies - entertaining.

2) When going on a trip into the remote wilderness, there must be at least one hot woman (China Chow) on the trip.
2a) There is an inverse relationship between how bad the movie is, and how much clothing the woman has on.
2b) If the movie is very bad, then 2a) holds true...unless the hottie quotient is raised (which happens in Frankenfish)
2c) If the movie is REALLY bad, then there needs to be obvious T&A.
3) B-Actors may live, but it's a guarantee that C-Actors are going to die horrible, contrived deaths.
4) Whoever acts like a dick is going to learn a vicious lesson about karma.
5) At least on of the disgusting death scenes has to be completely hilarious (happened over 5 times in Frankenfish).
6) Bad acting is a must
7) There needs to be at least one ""c'mon!"" moment, in which the characters do something so stupid that the viewers are forced to yell out in protest.
8) The bad guy will die by his own actions.
9) There has to be one unexplained, completely forced hookup of some kind.  (Honestly, if a mutant fish was killing everyone around you, would you be thinking about sex?)
10) The climax has to be the most ridiculous moment imagineable, with some convoluted, idiotic plan to defeat the bad guy.  And despite the fact that the plan has roughly the same odds as virginal teenager at a hillbilly wedding, the plan inevitably succeeds.

All that said, this movie is hilariously good.  It wasn't supposed to be funny, but it is.  A few of the actors aren't bad, and the CGI is not as horrible as I would have expected.

2128060,4,B0002W4SBI,"No, despite the title, ""Frankenfish"" isn't a painful-to-watch monster spoof trying achingly hard to be both cool and funny but failing miserably at both.  And despite what the title might also have you thinking, it's not a $10-budgeted filmed-in-the-basement-over-the-weekend student film.  It's a surpsisingly well done, at times quite fierce, and thoroughly fun, blast of monster mayhem.

  Set in the deep parts of the Florida everglades, the movie involves (as opposed to a re-animated fish swimming forth from a foreboding gothic castle) Chinese Snakeheads (real fish from China, piranha-like creatures who can live for a while on land and will even attack prey on land) who've been genetically engineered by a group of wealthy big-game hunters to grow to monsterous proportions, all the better for them to track down with their machine guns and grenade launchers during the pursuit of their 'sport'.  A ship carrying the cargo gets caught in a massive storm and washed up the river into the Everglades where the beasties get free just in time for lunch.  And, of course, the 'Frankenfish' have turned out even more lethal than their designers intended.  This movie is far from a spoof but it is a little on the campy side, a little on the tongue-in-cheek side, and it's a reminder that, occasionally, a bit of the campy elements in a horror movie don't necessarily have to be a bad thing, as long as they don't go overboard.

  The main protagonists in the film aren't the rich hunters.  A Florida cop and an Everglades wildlife expert are dispatched into the rivers to do some investigation into the discovery of a washed-up and eaten-up corpse, and end up at a cluster of houseboats where people live year-round in the Everglades making a living off fishing in the rich swamps and streams.  It's a likable cast that ends up as the fish's target for buffet of the day, and the bloody man vs. beast action sequences are better and more credible than you might think they'd be.  The movie doesn't try to present its creatures as more dangerous than they could conceivably be (taking into account that a regular-sized chinese snakehead is a pretty intimidating little predator, let alone a six-foot one).  Ergo, they're not presented as the harbingers of civilization's imminent collapse, but they are extremely dangerous to anyone on or remotely near to the waters they're in.  It's like with ""Jaws"" - the shark wasn't taking down big ocean-liners but you sure didn't want to be out swimming or even on a small sailboat when he was nearby.  The balance struck is right, the effects are solid and well-designed, and the whole movie surpasses what pretty well anyone likely thought it could be.

  An allout winner and a must-see for fans of aquatic/swamp horror like ""Piranha"" and the ""Anaconda"" movies.",1175299200,18,2807,4.91932059447983

I honestly don't know where to begin. This movie is a horrible shame. The acting is bad, the script is bad and the special effects are terrible! In fact, there's nothing good about this joke of a movie. Well...the last 20 seconds are pretty cool, seriously, but it's not worth tormenting yourself over to get to that point.

I tried really hard to like it and for the first 15 or 20 minutes it's okay. It's just when they start introducing new characters to the story and these characters live 4 hours up the river in the middle of nowhere, but they're all good looking people, even the ones that are suppose to be ugly, that wouldn't have anything to do with living on a junked out trailer trash of a river boat that just so happened to all live within 20 feet apart.

There's your token black ""Denzel Washington"" calm, cool and collect guy, there's your token voodoo lady that knows all and sees all, there's your token white trash idiot that wouldn't know his as* from a hole in the ground, there's your token gorgeous white lady that likes to be naked everywhere she goes, there's your token white loud mouth cry baby guy that just so happens to be a spoiled rotten attorney that I just couldn't wait for him to get the axe and last, but not least, there's your token rich, greedy, evil millionaire that thinks these genetically altered fish would make good hunting game for sport.

Everything about it is lame to the core. Even the cover of the dvd has it wrong...the guy on the front never takes his shirt off and the lady on the front never ever gets in the water. I could have easily ignored that because I've seen errors like that before, I'm sure it's designed to attract attention, and I could live with that if the movie actually had any value or quality to it.

SOME B movies are so well made they really aren't B movies at all, and when I feel I've found one, I'll let you know.

Frankenfish

SPOILERS AHEAD ... Of all the forms B-movies can take, a movie about a killer FISH ... is pretty low on my list of natural draws.  Bugs, mutants, snakes, wolves, sharks, Amazon warrior zombies from Uranus  ...  these things, by their nature, have great appeal.  : )  But a killer FISH?  OK, yes, I realize that sharks are fish.  And I'd have been a lot more likely to set aside the time to watch a movie called ""Frankenshark"" than one called ""FrankenFISH"".  It's sort like the difference between ""Werewolf"" and ""Weredog"" ... you see what I'm sayin?  One just sounds creepier and more impressive than the other.  I realize the movie's produces were trying to stay away from the whole ""it's just another shark movie"" thing ... but the word ""fish"" just doesn't carry much weight in this genre.  Unless maybe you pair it with ""hell"" ... ""hell-fish"" ... no ... even that sounds a bit soft.

Anyway ... I did eventually set aside time to sit down and watch Frankenfish one night on Sci Fi.  And after watching the introductory sequence with sunset shots of the USS Alabama in Mobile and a mildly (and nicely) grotesque opening sequence, things looked pretty promising.  The writing, directing, acting, lighting and photography in the first several scenes were all pretty good, certainly by B-movie standards.  So, I settled down with dinner to watch.  How did Frankenfish fair in the final analysis?  PLOT - sadly, there is no-one named Dr. Frankenfish with a la-BOR-aTORY in a castle on a mountain top ... but with that said ... ""big, nasty fish with lots of teeth and a never ending appetite terrorizes bayou dwelling victims ... and a lawyer dies horribly in the end."" ...  That's about it for the plot.  Hey, it's a B-movie, don't hold your breath.  As I said in my title, as fish stories go, it's mostly fish and not much story.  BABES - China Chow, K.D. Aubert (Scorpion King, Fredrick's of Hollywood) and Noelle Evans are all easy on the eyes.  I've not seen much of any of these ladies before, but I wouldn't mind seeing a lot more of all of them, especially Chow and Aubert.  As with many B-movies, there wasn't quite enough ""exposure"" for my lusty tastes, but the women they picked for this flick were of a rather high visual caliber (BTW ... There are some very nice free swimsuit shots of China Chow available on the web.)  ACTING - By B-movie standards, the acting wasn't bad in this flick.  Experienced actors Tomas Arana (Hunt for Red October, Gladiator, Pearl Harbor) and fellow Cincinnati native Mark Boone Junior (Batman Begins, John Carpenter's Vampires) aid with the whole suspension of disbelief thing and, again, by B-movie standards, the acting holds up fine.  GROSS-OUTS - Frankenfish was among the gorier movies of it's kind to make it to Sci-Fi, featuring plenty of scenes of ... well ... a really nasty giant fish ... chomping the blood soaked crud out of pretty much everyone in sight.  If you like plenty of splashy blood baths ... this one doesn't do too badly.  FEAR FACTOR - well, if the idea of big nasty fish sends chills down your spine, then you might find this one hard to take.  But for the rest of us, even though this was a fairly well crafted creature flick, I can't say I ever felt genuinely tense about what was going on.  GUILTY PLEASURES - One thing B-movie producers should realize (and all to often DON'T) is that if you're going to go to the trouble and expense of making a guilty pleasures movie, make sure you actually provide some guilty pleasures.  Yes, there was a fair amount of blood and yes the babes were pretty attractive.  But shameless pandering to the male and female libido with gratuitously skimpy wardrobes and voyeuristic camera angles  ... always helps.  Loose fitting trousers and blousy shirts on your well selected male and female cast members ... kind of misses the whole point.  If you're gonna do a guilty pleasures movie ... give us more than a trickle of stuff to feel guilty and aroused ABOUT.

Bottom Line ... this is a pretty well crafted, professionally made, sometimes nicely gory flick that falls short on guilty pleasures and story line.  I hear there's some nudity on the DVD version ... so maybe I'll rent it and check it out.",1128124800,,5009,4.703788748564868

2128074,3,B0002W4SBI,"I don't know what form of madness I suffer from that requires me to rent virtually every film from the ""animals run amok"" genre. Whatever it is, and such an illness ought to have a name, I'm currently passing through the advanced stages. I don't even bother reading a plot summary anymore when I see a DVD case with killer sharks, giant insects, or mutated monsters on the cover; I just rent the sucker immediately. It's likely--extremely, painfully likely--that the movie in question will stink. It goes without saying that the filmmakers lifted most of the plot from Spielberg's ""Jaws."" Doesn't matter. I'll still rent the movie in question and give it a watch. Such was the case with director Mark A.Z. Dipp&eacute;'s ""Frankenfish."" Just look at that cover! How could I resist such an alluring vision as that? If, for some reason, the cover is no longer visible, the case for ""Frankenfish"" shows two hapless looking people in water up to their waist in the foreground while a gigantic, ugly fish sporting lots of nasty looking teeth zooms toward them in the background. Yay! We're about to have some fun! Well, not really, but the movie isn't as bad as some in this genre.

""Frankenfish,"" set in the mythical land called Louisiana, begins by introducing us to a crack medical examiner named Sam Rivers (Tory Kittles) as he goes about investigating a crime scene. He quickly finds more than he bargained for when a call sends him further into the bayou to investigate a suspicious animal attack in the swamp. Teaming up with a busty scientist named Mary (China Chow), Rivers discovers with some alarm that the victim in question sports bite marks of an unknown origin. Uh oh. Obviously, an investigation needs to take place right away in order to ascertain the cause of death. It's equally obvious that such an investigation will likely CAUSE more deaths, but that's why we're watching. Anyway, Sammy and Mary head up the river...umm, swamp...to track down this nasty beastie. They soon stumble over a few rickety houseboats populated by a group of people from central typecasting. We've got some neo-hippie with a penchant for swamp grass and nekkid livin', a voodoo lovin' African-American family, and a sullen loner. After some tension filled chitchat between all the characters, disaster strikes in the form of a monstrous fish, a Frankenfish if you will, and the movie rapidly descends into ""monsters gone mad"" mode.

These fish are mean mothers! They can soar through the air like trained gymnasts, breathe air when necessary, and have the ability to pursue their prey out of the water. And they don't like these people or these houseboats. Predictably, the characters have no way to escape from these monsters, so they have to use their wits to survive until help arrives. When someone finally does show up, it's about as far from help as you can imagine. It turns out that some bored big game hunter imported a bunch of these fish from China and then had them genetically altered. Of course, they escaped and quickly began to breed in the river...umm, swamp. It's this hunter and some of his cronies who arrive to clean up the mess. One thing leads to another as many people die in horrible ways. Since ""Frankenfish"" is a genetic monster gone mad movie, we also must have the scenes where humanity reasserts its control of the natural world. How this happens is quite amusing, if completely illogical by orders of magnitude, and evokes memories of that Saturday Night Live sketch in which Dan Aykroyd as Julia Child ground that fish up in the blender. Roll credits.

""Frankenfish"" does have a few things going for it, things that set it apart from the typical ""Jaws"" ripoff. One, the movie has China Chow and K.D. Aubert, two cuties who if nothing else provide the audience with the requisite eye candy so important to the success of these types of films. Two, ""Frankenfish"" is massively gory. We see screaming flesh torn to shreds, ripped in half, punctured with bullets, and generally abused in delightfully saucy ways. Mutated fish don't worry about making a mess when eating their prey, apparently. Three, a character actually kills one of the monsters, tears its heart out, grills the dripping mess, and then proceeds to eat it as a form of revenge! Alas, what's good finds its opposite in what's bad, and ""Frankenfish"" frequently fails to rise above several obstacles. One, it's a ripoff of every creature flick we've ever seen. Two, the dialogue and the reactions of the characters to the unfolding carnage easily scale the heights of stupidity. Three, and the most important, the CGI effects used to depict the monstrous fish look like CGI effects used to depict monstrous fish. Don't get me wrong; the fish here look light years better than the cheesy rubber objects seen in a movie like ""Piranha,"" to cite one example, but they still come off as pretty schlocky.

Extras on the disc are limited to a bunch of trailers: ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" ""Frankenfish,"" ""Asylum of the Damned,"" ""Boa vs. Python,"" ""Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital,"" and ""Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid."" Overall, I'd give ""Frankenfish"" a solid three stars. It's stupid and derivative, but it's also entertaining and gory. I can think of many films in this genre that are far, FAR worse than this one. If you can't resist the lure of mutated beasties seeking revenge against humanity, if you can't pass up seeing another movie with killer sharks or giant insects, ""Frankenfish"" is must see viewing for you. All others should proceed directly to ""Jaws"" and give this a pass.",1124582400,7,5572,4.862105263157895

Other reviews here give a more-than-adequate summation of the silly plot, but my ""bad movie"" pal and I spent most of our time counting the decapitations and remarking on how remarkably bad the monster effects are.  The director wisely showcased the title creature only in very dark, quick, jerky shots to minmize how stupid and unconvincing it looks.

2128077,4,B0002W4SBI,"To fully appreciate this film, you are going to need to think outside the Hollywood box, anticipate the horrible acting, and prepare yourself for some creative CGI because this isn't your typical horror film.  This is a amazing family dynamic picture under the rouse of a ""B"" rated cheese film.  Think about it.  Throughout the film we are being bombarded with thoughts and hints of trying to build a family structure during this time of disaster.  Our human heroes are consistently trying to get with each other to perhaps build a long relationship.  There are the nudists that already have that family dynamic, there is the revenge bent friend that wants to kill Frankenfish because he ruined his family, then there is the voodoo woman trying to use potions to make her daughter fall in love with the cop that loves to rumble with frankenfish.  We have all of these family motives staring us in the face, but then we have a subliminal one happening as well.  Not to exploit the ending for those that haven't seen this fine film yet, but we need to think of the Frankenfish as more than just aquatic demons.  In the story of Frankenstein, Shelly means for us to see the beast as more than just a monster, but instead a human trying to enter a cruel society.  Perhaps these same themes were to be implied with Frankenfish.  Perhaps the fish were not killing the humans, but trying to fit into the other fish society.  Think about it.  Here we have humans killing fish for their pleasure, I am sure that the fish in the bayou are not happy about that, so whom do they ask to help ... the frankenfish.  They are just trying to raise a family, survive in a humanistic society, and also be accepted into their own fish society underwater.  These are very complex fish and I think also very misunderstood in this film.

Outside of this deeply rooted theme, the film itself is not as shabby as I thought it would be.  The story is jumbly, the acting is atrocious, and the only enjoyable moment that this film has going for it are the frankenfish themselves (where apparently a huge portion of the budget went to create them).  Yet, I wasn't expecting a high caliber of film here, I was expecting Muppets or puppets instead of the CGI created fish that honestly brought some horror to the screen.  They were spooky, and semi-humorous at the same time.  They reminded me of older horror films and the carnage that our forefathers of horror used to bring to us.  There was just something genuine about these creatures that propelled (HA ... pun there) this film into a much better category than I first anticipated.  Then, there was the actual fear factor.  While I wasn't frightened of this film, my wife had a field day.  Everyday I learn something new about her, and this time it was the fact that she takes some small pleasure in watching these ""B"" horror films.  She was a huge fan of Boa vs. Python, which fits right into this same category.  There is something spectacular about a film that gives you what you went in hoping for.  If you are expecting gruesome deaths, some nudity, and fantasy action, then you will not walk away from Frankenfish unhappy.

Is it bad to have such a low expectation of a film when first walking into it?  I don't think so.  I mean, honestly, unless you read Fangora or Film Fanatic magazine, you may not discover these ""under the radar"" films that may surprise you.  Working in a video store, I walked by this title at least a thousand times thinking how bad it must be because nobody is renting it, when in fact, when I decided to break the mold and experience it, I was impressed.  Low expectations of the film caused a positive reaction.

Overall, was this film great?  Nope.  Was it good?  I would have to raise my hand, probably in some embarrassing situation, and say ""yes"".  Frankenfish provided two hours of very decent entertainment and created this new monster for generations to enjoy.  It followed a simple Hollywood structure, but somehow bent it to create its own sensation.  The fish were frightening, while the ending provided a decent open-door policy for a sequel.  Will the sequel be as good?  No, I don't think so, but for those looking for some decent action, a passive story, and some Frankenfish (sans the bolts and lightening), then you may be pleasantly surprised by this little ditty of a film.  I know my wife and I were!!

2128078,1,B0002W4SBI,"This movie isn't as bad as you'd think it would be, going by the title. Maybe that was the intention. Hit the audience with a really bad title and then when the movie isn't as schlocky as the title suggests, people will be duped into thinking the movie isn't all that bad. But, just because it's not as bad as the title, doesn't mean it's good.

This movie belongs in a Bad Bayou Movie Double Feature with Tobe Hooper's ""Crocodile"". The DVD cover boasted ""From the director of Spawn!"" Now, is that supposed to be a good thing? There's a reason Mark Dippe was in director jail, and he has committed another film crime with this turkey. With any luck, this is a violation of parole, and will put him back inside.",1109635200,3,710,4.378787878787879
2128082,3,B0002W4SBI,"As I have mentioned elsewhere, I collect really bad movies. Incredible little beauties like anything (hell, EVERYTHING) Ed Wood ever did and BEAST FROM YUCCA FLATS, etc, grace my shelves. When I saw the title I knew I had to have this movie.

It doesn't fit.

Far from my usual fare, the acting is, for the most part, credible. The lead (who sounds very much like a young Denzel Washington) actor is quite good, in fact, as is his biologist sidekick. The women are pretty, the men are manly (grin), and with a couple of exceptions, the effects aren't too bad. The front view of the fish swimming toward the camera wasn't very good, but when it came out of the water and attacked, it was well done. I liked the bad guys, I liked the good guys. I could have done without the gratuitus nudity that served no purpose whatsoever (story-wise) except as a come-on for teenage boys. Thanks but no thanks. If I want to see nudity I'll get it elsewhere and in better quality.

I'm about to spoil the ending here so go no farther if you intend to see this movie. I loved the baby fish swarming over the lawyer at the end. I thought it very well done. As was the big male fish slamming into the back of the air boat.

Whether or not you buy this film just depends on what you like. Rent it if nothing else. I considered the money well spent and will recommend it to my horror flick loving friends. Not a great movie, but watchable. Especially the ending.",1106697600,,1442,4.32962962962963
2128083,5,B0002W4SBI,"Well, what can I say.  I never would have thought this movie would be anything more than mediocre.  The title and the Lake Placid-esque cover seemed to promise a turkey but ""Frankenfish"" turned out to be a little gem peppered with generous doses of gore and nudity.  I feel completely justified in handing out 5 stars to this movie; it ain't great art but it's enthralling and entertaining the whole way through.

Upon hearing of two gruesome dismemberments deep in the Louisiana bayou, a medical examiner (Tory Kittles) and a biologist (China Chow) are sent to investigate the deaths.  Examination of the bodies reveals that the body bites were too big for that of an alligator. No kidding! Once the two arrive in the very small bayou community (population: 7) they find themselves surrounded by giant mutated fish leaving them and the town's 7 inhabitants trapped.

Anyone who enjoyed the cult classic ""Tremors"" will get a real kick out of this one.  There are many similarities to be drawn; two outsiders enter a minuscule community in a remote area, remote area is terrorized by creatures and to survive the people have to stay above ground (in this case above water).  I wouldn't say it rips off Tremors; it just borrows a similar concept and then takes it in different directions.  Instead of desert style, we get swamp/bayou style.

Of course, a movie like this is never without its problems: For one, how in the world do any of the people in this tiny bayou community earn a living?  There are no tourists, no one passing by, it's completely isolated.  Fishing perhaps?  But who do they sell the fish to?  It doesn't make much sense.  Also, this film introduces a different angle in that there are humans behind the mutations of these frankenfishies, however that arc is never developed appropriately and the reasoning behind them wanting to make these GM fishies is ridiculously lame.

But who cares?  Like I've said, ""Frankensish"" is a bloody good time.  And I do mean bloody.  I couldn't believe how good the gore was in this film.  It literally splashed and drowned my entire screen blood red with each exceedingly creative kill.  The CGI is passable and the close-up looks of the Frankenfish's faces had me laughing my pants off each time.  This movie is well-filmed, stylish and gave a great taste of the bayou, I could practically feel the steam blasting me in the face.  Don't hesitate to pick up this little gem pronto.",1103932800,2,2436,4.761336515513126
2128084,1,B0002W4SBI,"While watching this movie I was not sure if they were trying to spoof the ""Anaconda"" series or what.  This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen this year.  Not only was the plot weak the character development was non-existent.  The roles are your typical characters, the hippie/stoners, the crazy vet, the undervalued employee and the mean boss.  The script even went as far to make the ""mean boss"" have some of the meanest lines you would ever hear, so that you would cheer for him to be killed by the monster.  The problem is that the lines were so bad or not mean enough that I never got to that point.  Stay away from this movie; I am sure you can find a better movie to see than this.",1103155200,2,697,4.203007518796992
2128085,3,B0002W4SBI,"Many years ago, it was reported that killer bees would invade the US.  As a result there were books and movies that sensationalized it; the most famous being Arthur Herzog's The Swarm.  Frankenfish is the nickname of the snakehead, a nasty, vicious, and voracious predator.  It grows to five feet, can crawl across land and survive out of water for days.  They have been invading many of the countries waterways including, recently, the Great Lakes.  It has been feared that the largest species, currently only found in the Northeast, would get to the warmer waters of Florida and the South.  This movie goes a step further.

A man has been found mutilated in the Bayou and a medical examiner and a Fish and Wildlife officer set out to investigate.  Along the way they befriend a small collection of colorful swamp folk.  Soon they realize that there is something bad going on and more people begin to die.  A rich guy and a group of Chinese seem to be involved.

In the end we learn that the menace is a snakehead that has been genetically modified.  The fish is considered a delicacy in some circles and experiments were run similar to those done to breed better salmon.  As this is not reality, the fish became much larger (not just ten or twenty percent) but was not good for the intended purpose.  Rich guy has purchased three of these fish but they gout out into the swamp.  Who it all resolves and who survives is the main reason to watch this one to the end.

Fans of the genre will recognize quite a few scenes lifted from Lake Placid and one from Jurassic Park The Lost World.  Unfortunately the story wanted a swamp and swamp folk but it was all filmed on a sprawling river (there might be swamp to the sides).  A few mistakes are made terminologywise for the region (county and not parish for example).  But it all comes down to wanting to see a movie where the fish eats people.  This movie does deliver on that score.  I think it would have been better if the script and scenery matched (substitute ""river"" for ""swamp"" and it would have been more believable).  Plus, snakeheads are vicious and have killed people before so they could have just had them swarm and be piranha-like and stay away from the growth angle.  That would have made the film better, but it is still fun as it stands.",1101081600,2,2302,4.507246376811594
2128086,4,B0002W4SBI,"When a stuck-up crime scene doctor gets a call to the deepest part of the Louisiana Bayou, he gets more than he can expect. Along with China Chow, the fish and wildlife agent, they encounter Jaws' distant cousin. A giant catfish monster is terrorizing the backwoods! It attacks anything that moves, gators, boats, and of course people.

There are some Chinese folks along with professional hunters who are after the fish too. Check out the Leopard Woman, you know who I'm talking about, whoa mama, what a hottie!

Well you get a White-Jamaican stoner nudist (yes you read that right) decapitation, his nudist wife gets eaten, voodoo witch woman gets bit in half, and poor China takes a BBQed shotgun to the face. You even get a Vietnam Vet who kills the fish with a shotgun. Of course when you kill a thousand pound fish, you gotta throw it on the grill! Well he removes it's heart and throws it on the fire. Only to be eaten himself in a surprise twist.

Also the daughter of the witch is slammin! She's got junk in the truck and a great set of headlights. Guess she'll be getting another job after lawyer boy shows his true colors.

Throw in some magic voodoo tea and you even have a love story. The way they kill the last fish with the airboat was worthy of an Oscar. That was just cool.

2128087,5,B0002W4SBI,"Surprise, surprise!  This movie was surpassed my expectations.  Although a low budget B movie, it looks and feels quite good for a movie of this genre.  The special effects are way above average and the director mounts some suspenseful let's wait to see who gets killed next scenes, and there are some surprises in that, too!  The director also avoided the standard bayou cliches, and even with stock type characters, there were some interesting nuances that made them original.  Troy Kittles made a nice Denzel-like hero; and the woman who played the voodoo lady was smartly modern, and her voodoo was underplayed.

This is a very good giant monster movie, and I liked it very much.",1100131200,,683,4.844827586206897
2128088,2,B0002W4SBI,"Actually, the tagline for the movie is `Welcome to the bottom of the food chain', but I think mine is more suitable.  Directed by Mark Dipp, once computer special effects artist on such films like The Abyss (1989), Back to the Future Part II (1989), Ghost (1990), and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), his ambitions have since led him into the realm of directing (does everyone in Hollywood aspire to direct?) with the film Spawn (1997) and now Frankenfish (2004).  The movie stars Tory Kittles (Malibu's Most Wanted, Paparazzi), once MTV host, now movie actress K.D. Aubert (Friday After Next, Soul Plane), and someone named China Chow (The Bit Hit).

Okay, so here's the deal...the film takes place in the Louisiana swamps (or so we're told, but it looked more like it took place mainly on a river than a swamp) and involves a mysterious creature who seems to have developed a taste for Cajun food as a local poacher gets ate up real good, leaving behind a rather funky torso and many unanswered questions.  Medical examiner Sam Rivers (Kittles) is sent to investigate, taking with him Mary Callahan (Chow), a gooberment employee for the wildlife and fisheries agency, as the nature of the attack indicates it was caused by an animal of some sort.  The pair make their way down the river and reach a secluded area, populated by a handful of somewhat embarrassing stereotypes, living on seedy and ramshackle, permanently anchored, houseboats.  The residents think there's evil swamp monster in the waters, but it turns out to be a huge, voracious, mutated fish imported from somewhere for some reason or other (I won't bother telling you how the fish got here, as the reasoning provided is so utterly stupid and moronic it actually boggled my mind).  Anyway, as the nature of the creature is revealed, the small group finds themselves trapped, their numbers quickly diminish, and the only option they have is to fight for their very lives.

There just wasn't a lot for me to like in this film.  I will say the two main female characters, played by Aubert and Chow, were really attractive so at least there was that (neither one gets nekkid).  The cast seems comprised entirely of actors best suited to be supporting players.  There were no standout performances and little chemistry, and subsequently, no real interest on my part whether the characters lived or died (which most of them do...the film is bloated with useless, obviously expendable, characters whose sole purpose is to suffer gruesome deaths caused by unexceptional CGI work...that's short for Character Generated Images, by the way).  The only actor I recognized was Richard Edson, who played one of the garage attendants (the white one) in the John Hughes film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), appearing here as a rather dopey looking Rastafarian with awful-looking dreadlocks, a penchant for nudism, fruit, and the wacky tobaccy.  Also, as always in movies like this, there's a character within the small group we're supposed to dislike from the get go so that when he gets killed, we can all say, ""Well, he deserved it.""  Problem was, while he was presented as kind of a jerk, he was nowhere near as jerky as the other characters perceived him to be, at least initially.  This only served to make the characters appear like condescending, judgmental halfwits deserving the same fate set aside for the original jerk.  I've seen a lot of mutated animal films involving snakes, alligators, crocodiles, sharks, etc., but a giant, killer tuna?  How in the world are you supposed to be afraid of this?  Or even take it seriously?  Look out, here come Charley Tuna, and he wants to nibble on your bum bum...the directing wasn't all that bad (not that great either), and the special effects, which consisted of both puppetry and CGI work (mainly the latter) look exactly like what it was, reasonably inexpensive special effects created for a reasonably low-budget film.  The two elements that really hurt this movie were the story and the script.  As far as the story, had they just went with the standard gooberment and/or evil corporation created monstrosity scenario, I probably would have dinged them a little for trotting out a hackneyed plot, but instead they tried to get cute and develop a completely idiotic premise I found about as hard to swallow as a bucket of greasy, gooey chum.  As far as the script goes, it was horrendously inept and lacked any real sense of realism.  It was just so very awkward, riddled with foolish statements, clumsy proclamations, and unnecessary profanity.  I know some will say I'm expecting too much from a film like this, but I don't think it's wrong to expect filmmakers to treat their audiences like they have some degree of intelligence.  I can suspend my disbelief to a great extent, but I felt too much was expected of me here, as the story and script were unwilling to meet me halfway.  Another thing...the movie was just plain boring...when you have little or no interest in the characters because they're either lifeless 2 dimensional constructs or just generally unlikable (or both), how are you supposed to be interested in what's going on?  One might say. ""Well, at least you can watch the attack scenes""...well, yes, that's true, but what there was was very short and to far in-between, ultimately leaving us with the lame story and annoying characters again.  I really didn't come into this expecting a lot, and I think I'm usually pretty generous when I feel at least a effort is put forth, but I didn't see that here, so it was disappointing that this film couldn't even rise to meager level of goodness I placed on it prior to its' start.

The high-definition, widescreen anamorphic print (1:78:1) does look excellent, and the audio is very good.  Special features are pretty minimal, comprised of about six trailers (one for this one) of other Columbia Tristar releases.

Oh, I know what you're thinking...""BUT she's been linked with MARKY MARK! How could you call her INTELLIGENT?""
But that's just it! She got her psychology degree from SCRIPPS so I assumed she found him an interesting mental case.

THEN I watched this thing. Hey, at least she was smart enough to make sure she'd never be asked to do a sequel...unlike some of the others in this bile-churning bottomless bowl of bouillabaisse.

Some movies are bad. Some are awful. And this one is...FRANKENFISH.

Matthew Rauch is in this and he is, in turns, clueless guy, jerk guy, cowardly guy, and drunken guy...but never SCARY guy. Showing he has range but not able to play to his strengths here.
Scary Guy is Doc from BACK TO THE FUTURE wannabe Tomas Arana  (yeah, I know, he was Quintus in GLADIATOR).
Our two leads are K. D. Aubert (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame) and Tory Kittles (Sons of Anarchy, True Detective) as the Coroner.
