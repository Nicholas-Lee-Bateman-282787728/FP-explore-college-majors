A couple problems with the production though;

First, you could use it for a drinking game and take a drink every time he says ""uh"" but you'd better have a medic standing by as you could slip into a coma before the first chapter is over.

They used a screen capture to program that would run as he narrated what he was doing at any given moment with a small picture in picture of him in the bottom right corner.  Why we needed to see his puzzled face is beyond me, but he was there taking up real estate in the video throughout.

He seemed to have a vague plan, but constantly made mistakes.  Though he may know his way around a sound editing program he sure didn't know what he was doing with video.  Uh.....retake.....  He made tons of mistakes and instead of doing them over and editing them out they just stayed there.

The screen capture I mentioned, was 3-4 seconds off of what he was saying and doing.  So you'd hear him say ""I'll press play"", hear the click and the music would start.  About three seconds later you would see him do what he said he was doing and what you already heard.  The entire video was off like this.

Numerous, ""Why isn't this working"" or ""Where is this"" comments and even muttering under his breath.

So, IF you need to learn the basics it CAN get you there but is VERY distracting.  I'm putting off the Advanced video by the same people till tomorrow....",1227830400,2,1451,4.302583025830258
