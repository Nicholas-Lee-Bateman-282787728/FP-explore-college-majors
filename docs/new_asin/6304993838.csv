7881517,5,6304993838,"I still think this stacks up as the best Australian movie ever to explain the cultural tensions between an ancient Aboriginal culture and a modern European one through the story of individuals in a small,outback community.  It illustrates the complexities and difficulties of finding common understandings - sometimes impossible even when participants want nothing else - unlike many films which deal in lazy generalizations about races and push a particular political position. This film is far more intelligent than that but consequently poses some difficult challenges for a viewer's preconceived attitudes, as most of us are not confronted by the problems explored in this film.",1389225600,,682,5.495238095238095
7881518,4,6304993838,"While I like Bryan Brown's other projects, this one is a bit difficult to understand at times sue to the heavy Australian accents. I LOVE accents but had to strain to hear these at times. It's worth keeping it for the collection no matter what.",1356912000,,244,4.444444444444445
7881519,4,6304993838,"This Australian movie is great in plot and direction it really shows the difference between Australian's both indigenous and non indigenous and how some people have to make choices regarding their culture.

I loved watching it again and I now own a copy of it for my own DVD collection.....",1278201600,,290,4.8
7881520,4,6304993838,"Ray (Bryan Brown), the resident white police officier in a remote region of the Australian Outback finds himself in over his head when a young male is murdered for descrating a local sacred site. Ray's attempts to locate the killer are hampered by the local aborginal community which views the death as required and justifiable by ancient tribal law. And so the confrontation begins.

Another great Australian film dealing with the vast differences between ""white man's law"" and the ""old ways"" of aboriginal society. Great performance by Bryan Brown and a nice cameo appearance by David Gulpilil.",1124668800,2,596,5.144329896907217
7881521,5,6304993838,"Bryan Brown heads an excellent cast in this tightly-scripted story about a clash between Australian and Aboriginal law. Brown is a ""whitefella"" torn between his duty as a policeman, and his connection to the land and community. His counterpart (Ernie Dingo) is a ""blackfella"" with the opposite problem--his aesthetics lie with the mainstream culture, but his heart forces him to stand by aboriginal customs. Behind these two men are a host of other characters, each adding a rich note to the theme of ambivalence connected to life in an outback settlement.
Dingo's final plea for tolerance strikes right to the heart. A wonderful film.
One comment: DVD is not captioned and the complex story can be a bit hard to follow--there were places I had to back up and watch twice to understand the Aboriginal side of the story. It was worth it!",1043193600,10,836,4.853146853146853
7881522,5,6304993838,"Made in the Australian outback, this movie depicts the clash of cultures between the Aborigine people and the 'white man.'
Wonderful acting by Bryan Brown as the police officer (Ray)trying to maintain peace and Ernie  Dingo as an aborigine preacher who is sometimes caught between the  aboriginal 'ways' and the 'white man's ways.'
A murder investigation  brings about bitter tension between the two peoples as Ray tries  desperately to bring about justice that is fair to both cultures which  doesn't always work.
Very good movie.  Each time you see it you see  something that you didn't the time before.",960336000,13,605,5.05050505050505
7881523,4,6304993838,"This movie involves the struggles of two cultures - Aboriginal and white man's - trying to live side by side in a very demanding and unredeeming environment.
It pits the Aboriginal laws against the white man's laws and  shows how the officer (Brown) assigned to the post, struggles to integrate  the two and keep peace between them, although not always succeeding. Bryan  Brown is, as usual, very good.
If you are interested in things Australian  and the outback in particular, this is a must see movie.  Interesting and  informative for everyone else.",923097600,6,552,4.945652173913044
