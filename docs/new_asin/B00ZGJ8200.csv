8720166,2,B00ZGJ8200,"I was so looking forward to watching this story because the devotional book is very good, but I came away sorely disappointed.  I struggled with whether to finish the whole DVD but thought to give it a chance.

Some of the scenery is pretty but the acting is stiff and unnatural. The music almost constantly playing in the background was distracting too.

There's a second part to this but I haven't watched it yet.  Unfortunately, this part didn't do much to inspire me to want to.",1458432000,,482,4.569767441860465
