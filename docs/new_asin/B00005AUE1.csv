7936646,4,B00005AUE1,"A simple yet well executed story about a High School Snr Football-star's journey into maturity and encounter with an Indian former player ""Spirit"" guide as Jason Wiles character Greg Sima(covicts son)adjust's to the constant upheavel and relocating by mother Sally Cima(Margot Kidder/Superman) to follow Dad's prison transfers and the toll it take's on the whole family. Only with gradual understanding and training by Spirit(Russell Means/Under A Killing Moon)do both characters acheive their personal goals and gain meaning from it's teaching's. Almost like a disney movie of the week tale but very likeable and almost touch of ""Karate Kid"" echo's to the film.

Solid performances allround, good score and beautiful cinematography of Utah landscape. Value viewing entertainment, hard to believe this movie is 10yrs old still holds up to today.",1120262400,2,845,5.550387596899225
7936647,4,B00005AUE1,"This has been called a ""family film,"" by which people mean that there's nothing in it inappropriate for young children, yet it has enough of a plot to hold an adult's attention. This certainly is the case.
You'll feel you've seen this movie before: it's about the underdog triumphing over the system, a type of movie churned out by the dozens, but the fact that there are so many movies like this means they have a lot of appeal. It has shades of Field of Dreams, which is another thing most people can't get enough of. Within its genre, this is a very good film.
Windrunner is well put together. The cinematography is excellent. Margot Kidder plays the hero's mother, and manages to make a dime-a-dozen film into a personal triumph. I wish she had more screen time.
The animal trainer for this film is very good. There's a that mustang seems like a genuine feral horse, though obviously he must really be a well trained animal. It's as though the horse is really acting.
There's a lot of football in the movie, which was a problem for me; I don't know much about sports, and I know more about forming the subjunctive in Persian Cuneiform than I know about football. Poor judge as I am, though, I'll venture that the football play looks authentic. Still, it took some time before I could identify with the football playing hero. Moreover, the hero-- albeit attractive and likable-- to whom football is supposed to be everything, is not always convincing; even though the scriptwriter tells us that his great love is football, I don't see the actor conjuring this up. He loves to be physically active, and his training scenes are a joy, but that he has a specific passion for football is not always in his face or his voice (though he's otherwise excellent).
Although generally well-paced, the film drags a little in a couple of places. Still, this is a film that is appropriate for children, but will still hold an adult's attention, and it deserves a watch.",1069027200,5,1958,4.629310344827586
