8173720,4,B00005QJIL,"The Lost Kung Fu Secrets is a better than average old school styled Kung Fu flick. Anyone who is really into these movies wants a simple plot, good characters, and lots of fight scenes matching different fighting styles. This movie has all of this. David Chang is cool as usual.",1290124800,2,278,4.58
8173721,5,B00005QJIL,"I originally saw this movie years ago and I knew then that I had to include this film into my collection of martial art movies. David has made numerous films for the Shaw Brothers this is not a SB product but most of them were brilliant he's a leader in kung fu movie history in empty hand and weapons combat. This film is one of his many gems and probably has more fight scenes than any of his other movies, the movie centers around him trying to protect a royal family from traitors and in the process basically taking on a hole army. I give it 5 stars for plot, action and overall concept plus theres never a dull moment here.",1169164800,7,629,4.206611570247934
