My kids loved it (especially my four year old).
I thought it was awful.",1395619200,,108,3.5416666666666665
8617023,3,B00FMXMS78,"First off I would have given this cartoon movie a higher rating, but why must a cartoon that is teach kids to eat fish have curse words it in?

""Never wanting to endure the taste of fish again, 10-year-old Opil jokingly wishes for his dinner to disappear forever. But the wish becomes a reality when space mutants from his favorite comic books come to life and threaten to dry up all the oceans. Now he must team up with the heroic Captain Mackerel and his daughter Marina and undo his wish before it's too late.""",1393200000,2,513,4.4
