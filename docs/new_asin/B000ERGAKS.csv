 The dance at the end of the DVD is the best part.
I also think that iamed videos are usually overpriced.",1217376000,7,381,4.366197183098592
8113566,2,B000ERGAKS,"When I saw the title of this DVD, I was ecstatic. I thought the DVD would include combinations that would be intermediate/advanced; I was extremely disappointed. A lot of these dancers are well known, but the combinations leave much to be desired and I expected more. I only liked aprox 4 of the combinations and each instructor did I think two combos each. Definitely not worth the price. For the advanced beginner at best.",1173312000,12,424,4.743243243243243
