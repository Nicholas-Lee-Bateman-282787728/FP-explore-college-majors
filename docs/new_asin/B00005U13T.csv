1662797,3,B00005U13T,"A homicidal maniac is on the loose, killing motorists at random in his ""death car"" - after losing his brother to the twisted assassin ""Skull"", Rick Benten becomes a vigilante, and takes it upon himself to hunt down the reckless drivers that fill the streets at night. Being a master mechanic, Rick spends his time converting his pickup truck into an armed and dangerous vehicle - with speed to take on the fastest car, and strength to make sure in a one-on-one situation, he will be the only survivor. The cops soon find out about the vigilante known only as the ""Gladiator"" and do all they can to catch him before his citizen's arrests go one step too far - but will they find the Gladiator before the Gladiator finds Skull? When the two finally meet, it's a duel to the death and maybe an end to Rick's career as the vigilante.",1270080000,2,829,4.4605263157894735
1662798,4,B00005U13T,"The Gladiator is not a great movie but is very good and worth watching. Parts of
it are really exciting. I have always enjoyed vilglante movies where a good guy
goes after the bad boys. Give it a shot if you can get a good deal on the DVD>",1263686400,,239,3.8979591836734695
1662799,2,B00005U13T,"Well, I received my copy.  And - while I recognize the title is hard to find - I was a little disappointed with the quality.  The recording looks like a VCR tape of a TV broadcast that has been transferred to DVD.

Again, I recognize that the title is hard to find or impossible to find.  So I accept that this was the best they could do.  I just want other buyers to know that this isn't going to look great on your TV.",1251072000,9,420,3.9523809523809526

1662824,3,B00005U13T,"Bought for the Gladiator.  I remember seeing it when I was young, but honestly it's an okay movie.  IMO, it's not as good as Highwaymen w/ Jim Caviezel.  As for Nick Knight, it was actually a decent movie.",1456272000,,205,4.342105263157895
1662825,2,B00005U13T,I bought this for the Rick Springfield movie and now I know why they replaced him for the television show. Did not enjoy this at all.,1455753600,,133,4.153846153846154
1662826,3,B00005U13T,"Deep metaphysical fable, the Gladiator is perhaps Ferrara's most personal work. By its rhythm, the quality of the script and its unique atmosphere, this is a great tv show largely outperforming many theatrical releases.",1448582400,,219,5.470588235294118

1662852,4,B00005U13T,Bought this DVD specifically for 'The Gladiator.'  Been a Ken Wahl fan ever since 'Wiseguy.'  Plus this was filmed in the San Fernando Valley where I grew up.  I was able to spot many familiar places and locations.  Fun!,1417651200,2,220,4.564102564102564

1662854,5,B00005U13T,Good movie good story line. Wish it could be a little better recording. Had seen the TV show and had been looking for it on DVD. It took 2 companies to get the movie as the first one I received was scratched beyond repair.,1383436800,,222,4.068181818181818
1662855,5,B00005U13T,"I got this movie just to see what the Forever Knight series was based on.  I laughed through several parts!  That's not a bad thing.  The movie was just what you'd expect from that decade: cheap movie effects, over-the-top exaggerated movements/expressions, and vampire makeup that was like Angel's on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Really enjoyed this movie!!!",1367193600,10,357,5.2105263157894735
1662856,4,B00005U13T,"Loved Ken Wahl.  He was such a good actor, as recognized by Paul Newman.  I enjoyed this and everything else he did.",1365724800,4,116,4.2272727272727275
1662857,5,B00005U13T,this I saw when I was a kid wasw amaized I even found it back this is a great older movie,1360972800,,89,3.2857142857142856
1662858,3,B00005U13T,"I saw this movie many years ago and as I find is often the case when watching movies years later, they don't quite measure up to what I remembered. Still a good movie though, however the quality was horrible as one other person said. The picture is grainy like the product of several generations of analog copies. The sound is slightly out of sync with the video and the volume is a little low but when you turn it up you hear a loud hum.
I'm sure it doesn't pay to go back and professionally remake every ""B"" movie made over the last 50 years because there isn't enough market demand to justify the cost involved. However if you're just wanting to fill in the blanks to see how much you remember and clear up the fuzzy spots then this is adequate. There are a lot of movies I saw back in the day that I'd like to see again on DVD if the quality was at least equal to this (preferably better) and the price was reasonable.",1324080000,,922,4.185393258426966

7954018,5,B00005U13T,"Good example of 80's films. Nick Knight is a typical vampire film, not much special effects compared to modern vampire films. Good solid cast and acting. The Gladiator is well made and you can see the car being made, no computers or special features. Just a big muscle car.",1495497600,,273,4.591836734693878
7954019,5,B00005U13T,"Watched The Gladiator with Ken Wahl when I was a teenager and managed to tape it from the tv. The tape went bad and I lost the movie, so I needed to replace it. Glad I did.
The Nick Knight movie was on the disc as well. I remember watching Forever Knight on tv about the vampire cop, and this would be a movie about the same vampire, just played by a different actor. Still an entertaining movie.",1471737600,2,396,4.089743589743589
7954020,5,B00005U13T,"I got this for the movie Nick Knight as it was cheaper to buy it as this double set than the single movie.
If you're a fan of Forever Knight you'll enjoy this.
I've not watched the other movie yet.",1468713600,2,197,3.95
7954021,4,B00005U13T,"Bought this movie for Nick Knight starring Rick Springfield. I remember the original broadcast and it turned into the launch vehicle for the three season hit series Forever Knight.  The quality is not great, but I wanted the film in my collection. I have no idea what the Gladiator movie is that comes with it.",1468627200,,310,4.636363636363637
