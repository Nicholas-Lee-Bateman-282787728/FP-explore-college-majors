4307018,4,B004AC6PTY,"Yes, all four movies are fun and watchable, but the really original one is ""Bug.""  I've never seen anything like it ever. Makes the whole set a great bargain, in my opinion.",1381795200,3,173,4.40625
4307019,5,B004AC6PTY,"Gore, Sex, Awesome effects. This is all you need for low budget horror success. Ask Troma if you don't believe me. some parts are even, gory enough to make a girlfriend turn away. You owe it to yourself, if you are a horror fan to own this collection.",1373414400,3,251,4.25
4307020,4,B004AC6PTY,"Over the last year I've been collecting a lot of these Four Movie Sets that Lionsgate puts out regardless if I own one of the films on Blu-ray.  I got this one for Bug which a lot of people seem to hate but I loved.  In this set, you also get The Eye, Ju-On, and Alone In the Dark. Here's a quick summary of the titles:

The Eye
  A young concert violinist, blinded in a childhood accident, is given a second chance at sight via an organ donor.  Unfortunately, this gift comes with a dark price as she begins to see visions of tragedies both past and yet to come.  This is the 2008 American remake and it stars Jessica Alba and Alessandro Nivola.

Bug
  A haunted young woman hiding from her past and living in a rundown motel meets a charismatic stranger who may or may not be who he says he is.  Before long, she too begins to feel as he does but does their paranoia have a solid foundation or are they both going crazy together?  Stars Ashley Judd, Michael Shannon, and Harry Connick, Jr.

Ju-On: The Grudge
  There is a curse born of a deep seeded rage. It gathers in the place where the dead once lived and whomever crosses its path dies and the curse is reborn in a new location.  This is director Takashi  Shimitzu's original remake of his Japanese tv mini-series that inspired the 2004 American remake The Grudge.

Alone In the Dark
  An ancient race of beings have found a way to enter our world and only a private investigator specializing in the paranormal can stop them before they take over.  Stars Christian Slater, a horribly miscast Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff.  Also buyers take note that the box claims that this version is the unrated director's cut.  It is not. The cut you get is the R-rated theatrical cut that bombed out in theaters in under a week. This false advertisement is why I'm deducting a star. Not that it would help this particular movie, I just expect the studio to give me what they say I'm paying for.

Nice space saver.  All four movies come on their own disc and all contain all of their individual special features.",1346198400,3,2056,4.375661375661376
4307021,5,B004AC6PTY,"I bought this set just for The Unspoken Truth (I'm a huge Lea Thompson fan) and figured I'd enjoy the movies it was paired with. Wel, guess what... I DID!  Darkness Before Dawn really blew me away with it's story of drug addiction.  Prophet of Evil was great, and I hadn't even heard of Ervil LeBaron before I had seen it.  Sex, Lies & Obsession was also very, very enjoyable.  This is such a good deal being that it's basically 4 movies for the price of 1.",1334534400,,457,4.218390804597701
4307022,5,B004AC6PTY,"The hubby and I rarely can agree on what movies to get, but when we saw this we both jumped at the chance!  I personally have always loved The Unspoken Truth ever since I first saw it (why aren't there more Lea Thompson movies!?!?!) and Prophet of Evil is one of his favorites so this was obviously the perfect buy.  Neither of us had seen Sex Lies & Obsession or Darkness but we absolutely loved them.  Four great movies for the price of one? I'll take it!! TREAT YOURSELF to this deal!!",1333584000,,488,4.282608695652174

8419981,4,B004AC6PTY,"When I purchased this DVD I was only interested in one of the four movies, ""The Gravedancers"" .  I had a hard time finding it alone.  I have watched the other three movies and they are not that bad.  ( I'll try not to give away very much of the movies)
""The Gravedancers"" is about three friends that go to a friends funeral.  They end up going back to the grave site very late that same night, found a poem left on the grave site and with help from some champagne they danced on grave sites that belong to a child pyromaniac, an ax murderer, and a rapist.  This didn't go over well with spirits and the horror begins.  The acting isn't bad in this one and the story line flows well. I think this is the best one of the four.

""Borderland"" ; This one is scary without the help of ghosts. On a trip to a Mexican border town, three college friends stumble upon a human-sacrifice cult. The leader of cult thinks the human-sacrifices will give him strength and protection.  This movie co-stars Sean Astin from the Lord of the Rings and The Goonies fame. The acting and story line are both good.

""Unearthed"" ; When an unexplained trucking accident knocks out phone lines and the only road in & out of a small town in New Mexico, and after an investigation into the crash an otherworldly creature that could pose a threat to the entire human race was found.  A small group of trapped travelers and a drunk town sheriff have to fight to survive.  the frightened group discovers that their only hope for survival is a Native American girl that was responsible for unleashing the beast. This movie had a hard time keeping my interest.

""Dark Ride"" ; Years after two twin sisters are brutally slain in an amusement park fun-house, the police quickly  shut it down. Now, years after the fact, the  park has become a silent monument to the horrors of the past.  A group of college students decide to break into the park and tempt fate by taking the Dark Ride for one last spin, the murderous force that lay dormant for so many years returns to continue the killing spree that shook the local community to its very core. I didn't find the acting very good in this one.

Everyone has their own tastes when it come to horror movies but I think this group of movies is slightly better than average.",1437091200,5,2282,4.397619047619048
8419982,3,B004AC6PTY,"I threw out Sex, Lies and Obsession DVD.  Though it had a Message of forgiveness they did not need to put the topless or almost nude dress in the night club scenes.  Not a very good movie for someone who wants to over come this kind of obsession.  The unspoken truth and  Darkness before dawn had a good message in them.  The Prophet of Evil  I only wanted that one because I've personally met several of Ervil LeBaron's children And knew some of the story.  It was an Evil Slavery cult that used young women for their purpose.  Many of their family members have written books that are more accurate than the movie.",1436054400,,615,4.380530973451328
8419983,5,B004AC6PTY,got this one for borderland its worth the other lame movies on here,1426982400,2,67,4.230769230769231
