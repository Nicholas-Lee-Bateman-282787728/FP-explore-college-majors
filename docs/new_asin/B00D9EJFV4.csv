Overall value is excellent...and this is the first AUTHORIZED ""Brain That Wouldn't Die"" release and it is FULLY restored and letter-boxed and a never-before-seen nude scene outtake is included as a bonus (no sound, great quality...originally shown in European cinemas).

5785444,5,B00D9EJFV4,You get two fairly interesting old sci-fi movies and two truly classic ones at a cheap price expectually Reptilicus which is out of print and quite pricey otherwise. Can't beat it for it really is a great deal.  ProgMark,1378598400,4,220,4.641025641025641
5785445,4,B00D9EJFV4,"If you like this sort of thing (schlock sci-fi) like I do and don't have these films in your collection grab this one! At this price it's a fantastic bargain! The 4 films are all on one side of a dual layer disc which provides only about 2 GB disc space per title but they look very good. Best news is that three out of four of the films are anamorphic wide screen with ratios of 1.85:1 and 1.66:1. ""Reptilicus"" should be widescreen too but it's 1.37:1 open matte here. For the most part there is plenty of headroom at the top with ""Reptilicus"" so it looks perfectly acceptable (although grainier) if you use the ""Zoom"" (NOT ""Stretch"") setting on your widescreen HDTV. Only extras are a still gallery and a short (45 second) outtake from ""Brain That Wouldn't Die"" that was apparently used in versions for some foreign countries where censorship laws were more liberal than here in the USA at time of the original release!

5785446,5,B00D9EJFV4,"BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE has all the gore and the complete striptease fight scene (fans of this film will know what I'm talking about).  There's also a brief foreign scene (in the supplement section, without dialog) that has some topless imagery in it.  That scene was only shown in foreign countries.  The model wears a bikini in the American version of that scene.

BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE and AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN are in 1:66-1.

NEANDERTHAL MAN is in 1:85-1, while REPTILICUS is full-frame.  The aspect ratios look correct, although I'm not certain about REPTILICUS.

There is also a running photo gallery with photos and poster repros of the films.  BRAIN gets a generous 38 images, including a couple of cheesecake shots.

Just received my 2 discs, one for each package (4 movies to a disc.) The first is Sci Fi Classics and contains:

The Man from Planet X-The picture is darker than the Midnight Movie print, same AR.

Beyond the Time Barrier-It's a step up from the Cheezy Flix print and both are 1.37:1.

The Time Travelers-This hasn't been released on SD yet, but the print is quite nice with good colors. It's shown at 1.66:1 and is slightly window boxed (small black lines on top and bottom.)

The Angry Red Planet-The picture is much darker than the Midnight print, colors are slightly lighter. Both are 1.37:1, but IMDB says 1.66:1?

(It has stills from all the movies in the extras section and all are quite good.)

The second is More Sci Fi Classics and contains:

The Amazing Transparent Man-Roan put out a good version, but it's much darker and this print you can see everything. It's window boxed at 1.66:1, but the Roan version is 1.85:1 (IMDB 1.85:1?)Now here's a big difference between the two and I don't know which one is correct. The MGM version starts with the opening logo, goes to some scenes and then shows the title and credits. The Roan version, starts with the logo, goes to the title and THEN goes to the scenes. I think this that's the correct way it should be seen.

Reptilicus-The picture has brighter colors and is slightly darker than The Midnight Movie version. The MGM version is zoomed in and the Midnight Movie version is zoomed out, I wonder why? The Midnight version looks the best. Both are 1.37:1.

The Neanderthal Man-Looks pretty good in 1.85:1. Nothing to compare it to.

The Brain that Wouldn't Die-The picture is zoomed in, window boxed and is 1.66:1. The Synapse version shows all the picture, is window boxed, not zoomed in and is the uncensored version...this I don't understand and I'll explain. I like the Synapse version the best.

(It has stills from all the movies and has a foreign scene in the extras section.) This is a nude scene of a model with a bunch of photographers snapping her picture. She is completely nude. In the Synapse version, it says its the uncensored edition, but this model is in a polka dotted bikini, no nudity anywhere. So how is it an uncensored version?

I bet some kid is gonna buy this and his parents are gonna raise hell when they find this out. Kinda like Swamp Thing European version. First hand knowledge. Watching with my 6 year grandson and she pops out of the water...I was so embarrassed.

All in all, both are worth the $5 apiece if only for Beyond the Time Barrier, The Amazing Transparent Man, The Time Travelers, The Neanderthal Man and of course the foreign nude scene...that lady is a beauty!!!

I compared these films in my HT thru an ISF'd Epson 9500 UB PJ to a Panny BD30 and a HDA1 shown on a 110"" JKP Affinity Screen, of course both players are upscaling.",1374105600,9,3032,4.568265682656826

5785465,5,B00D9EJFV4,"When I was a kid and before there was cable, there was late night TV where, if you were lucky, you'd could find some of those old Sci-Fi classics playing.  While the low budget effects are laughable when compared to today's CGI, that was not the case to a young imagination when I first watched movies like this long ago.  I still enjoy them to this day and continue to search for those hidden gems and hard to find classics.  I came across the ""Movies 4 You"" collections and have found them to be a great deal and transfers of some of these classic films.  I picked this particular collection up especially for ""Reptilicus"" and ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"".  ""Reptillicus"" was one that I had never seen before and I'm glad to be able to finally add it to my collection.  It's the only one in this collection that is filmed in color but unfortunately it is also full screen.  The other three films are widescreen.  The transfers look great to me on my 50 inch plasma, but don't go expecting HD Blu Ray here.  The collection contains extra footage for ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"" (very interesting) and some still galleries.

I'd also recommend the counter part collection to this series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Movies-4-You-Sci-Fi-Classics-The-Man-from-Planet-X-Beyond-the-Time-Barrier-The-Time-Travelers-The-Angry-Red-Planet/dp/B00D9EJFZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Movies 4 You - Sci Fi Classics (The Man from Planet X / Beyond the Time Barrier / The Time Travelers / The Angry Red Planet)</a>.

The surgeon takes the dismembered head to a friend's lab & keeps it alive in a big petrie dish. He plans to kidnap a suitable body & reassemble his girlfriend's head to it (real nice!). Through it all, the head begs him to let her go. She gets her revenge through a grotesque surgical monstrosity kept in the surgeon's friend's lab closet. Includes a deleted scene.

That said, I can't detect any noticable video-quality loss. They must be lower-quality, but I suspect fans of these films will be hard-pressed to fret about minor video-losses compared to the film's storylines, acting and production itself.

THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN is a favorite with Douglas Kennedy powerhousing his way into the lead role in basically a heist-crime drama.  THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE is fairly silly to begin with and little else removes that opinion, but it's still worth the giggles.  REPTILICUS answers the ages-old-question, ""Why don't more countries' film industries do Monster movies?""  Well... OK... this is Denmark's reply.  There weren't any others.

Wasn't expectin' that!  Then there's also the amazing performance of Tandra Quinn as the illiterate deaf-mute maid in ""The Neanderthal Man"" (which also stars Robert Shayne - Inspector Henderson from ""The Adventures Of Superman"" - hooray!) - absolutely blowin' away the other female competition in the movie's cast!  ""Gimme more!"" I said, and a quick Google search helped me remember that I had one of her other films (two of the four - hot dog!), Ron Ormond's ""Mesa Of Lost Women"" (another silent performance from Miss Quinn - and from the same year, too: 1953) on one of the aforementioned public domain sets, so I devoured that one the other night too!

They held up well.  I had an old VHS copy of Reptilicus and this is the first time I have ever seen the movie this clear and solid.  I love seeing the old Danish Army with their strange mix of WWII American and British equipment and vehicles try to stop the monster.  The movie is about the discovery of a frozen prehistoric dinosaur in the far north.  The Danes take it to a laboratory where it begins to grow and eventually becomes a real dragon!
The Neanderthal Man tells the story of a scientist who is experimenting with regressing animals back to prehistoric types, including a sabre tooth tiger, and himself!  The Amazing Transparent Man tells the story of a serum that makes people invisible.  Naturally, bank robbery is the first idea for those with access to the serum.  Finally is the Brain That Would Not Die.  It's a goofy premise but the actors do a wonderful job with what they have.  Virginia Leith is especially effective as the title character.  She goes from sympathetic young woman to evil monster over the course of the movie.  It must have been very difficult to play that role with only your face and voice to express your character.

5785535,5,B00D9EJFV4,"You've seen ""Brain That Wouldn't Die"" a hundred times, but you've NEVER seen it like this before!  Neither have I, and I've been watching it since the early 1970s on late night TV when it was still considered quite shocking and very scary (it scared my mom and I to death).

The MGM version is a fine-grain 35mm print struck from the original camera negative. This print is razor sharp...now you can see the faces of background actors and count the dead branches on trees.  AMAZING!  The Synapse version is a rather soft old TV print.  When I first saw the Synapse version, I was so disappointed...I figured ""Brain"" must have been shot on 16mm and blown up to 35mm.  I was wrong!  MGM's version makes the Synapse one--and all others--obsolete.

The MGM version is in 16:9.  No, the movie was not shot in anamorphic.  As was customary in 1959, indie films whose budgets didn't allow for renting expensive anamorphic lenses shot their films in 4:3, with the DP allowing extra ""head room"" and ""leg room"" in his frame, so that drive in theater projectionists could mask off the top and bottom of the frame and simulate a widescreen image.  So the MGM print is masked as it was in its 1962 theatrical release.  That's fine, because it was the producer's intention that the frame be masked and this gives the movie back much of its dramatic importance.  Plus, it plays better on an HDTV.

The MGM version also allows a black space on left and right of frame, so you can finally see stuff like the last guy on the right taking pix of Adele Lamont.  In the Synapse version, he's half cropped out.

The Synapse version has a terrible reel-change in the last ten minutes, when Dr. Cortner is preparing a Mickey Finn for Doris.  It's painful to watch because the awesome music score hiccups with the bad reel change, taking you right out of the moment.  The MGM version plays flawlessly through this scene.

There are two cuts in the MGM version.  One almost the instant the film starts and the other about a minute in.  It's a shame because this causes two abrupt skips in the movie's spooky music score, spoiling some of the mood.  There are NO OTHER CUTS in the MGM version.

So happy with this purchase!  Maybe someday MGM will replace the two missing pieces and issue a Blu-Ray of BTWD.  Wouldn't that be fantastic???",1390521600,19,2311,4.550970873786408
5785536,3,B00D9EJFV4,"Others have described the plots of these timeless classics quite well;  all I'm going to do is critique them.

1.  The Amazing Transparent Man---***  A modest 58 minutes but a good 58 minutes.  Any bank robber with any sense would
  much rather use invisibility to rob banks than use it to steal scientific supplies to help create an invisible army, so Douglas
  Kennedy's character has some very sound motivation here.  Yes,  it's all cheese, but in director Edgar G. Ulmer's capable hands
  it's a very lean and tasty cheese.  James Griffith should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this;  I guess
  competition was just too strong that year.

2.  The Neanderthal Man---**  Good cast but really poor effects, even for the zero budget. Why set the story in the High
  Sierra foothills and then film most of it indoors?  Since there was so little money, it would have made more sense to put
  the terrifying creature in the Hollywood Hills, or Sunset Blvd, except if it was on Sunset he might not have gotten
  noticed.

3  The Brain That Wouldn't Die---**  (original working title was ""The Brain That Categorically Refused to Die"".) Most of the scripting and acting is right out of the
  Ed Wood method.  The one exception is Virginia Leith, who was also excellent in 'Toward
  the Unknown'  and really deserved more star treatment than studios gave her.  As bad as 'Brain' is, I do see where it
  gets its cult reputation. It's a terrible movie, but one with style.

4.  Reptilicus---*  Surprisingly, this is the real dog of the bunch.  The monster seems to be paralyzed from the lower
  neck down, plus the monster is a very poor actor as monsters go.  Danish filmmakers must take a dim view of American generals, because
  the one here is really grouchy.  He does settle down once a gorgeous Danish blonde takes him out for a tour of
  Copenhagen.  In fact, the main value of 'Reptilicus' is the picturesque views of Denmark, and the cafe pop singer isn't
  bad either.  Everything else is virtually unwatchable,  too inept to even be taken as camp.

Picture quality of all 4 movies is reasonably good,  and there's an inspiring bonus feature:  it appears that the American version of 'Brain That Wouldn't Die' had surplus female costuming but the European version corrected the problem.",1387152000,10,2302,4.724489795918367
5785537,4,B00D9EJFV4,"Over the past year or so there have been a number of these MOVIES 4 YOU DVDs released under the MGM banner in conjunction with Timeless Media. They specialize in B movie horror and sci-fi and come primarily from the American International and United Artists back catalogue. They are designed to give the consumer a decent product at a good price. While special features are missing, the quality of the prints used is pretty remarkable and they look great on most playback equipment although these releases weren't originally designed for flatscreen TVs. The one major drawback is that there are no subtitles available for the hard of hearing and let's face it, most of the purchasers of these collections aren't exactly spring chickens having seen these movies for the first time when they were kids. Of the collections out there so far, this is one of the best. The films are...

...THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN is another low budget classic from director Edgar G. Ulmer. Shot in 1959, it is another example of Ulmer's uncanny ability to make a visually interesting film from next to nothing. A safecracker (Douglas Kennedy) is broken out of prison to aid in stealing nuclear material to make a madman's invisible army. It was good to see 1930s star Margurite Chapman as a tough moll who aids the bank robber turned hero. The running time is under an hour (59 minutes) and it holds together quite well until stock footage takes over at the end. Great final line though.
...REPTILICUS (1962) is the world's only Danish giant monster movie and it's a great way to visit the Copenhagen of the early 1960s. Part travelogue and part monster on the rampage, REPTILICUS is a testament to the willing suspension of disbelief as he entertained countless young audiences (and Danes who are proud of the film) despite the fact that the monster is a marionette. Starts off well and then gradually goes downhill although the people falling off the bridge is impressive. Love the design of the beast. This is the only color film in the set.
...THE NEANDERTHAL MAN is the oldest film in the set (1953) and the only one I had never seen before. It stars Robert Shayne (misspelled as Shane), Inspector Henderson of the 1950s SUPERMAN TV series, as a scientist experimenting with chemical regression. He turns housecats into saber tooth tigers, his mute servant into a cavewoman and himself into the title character. Full of lots of talk and erratic special effects (the tiger is terrible but the Neanderthal is not bad), I found it strangely compelling thanks to Shayne's committed performance.
...THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE (1959/62) is a fitting final offering as it was one of the most notorious films of its era. BRAIN is one of those films that shows the underbelly of the 1950s. It is unapolgetically cheap and lurid but surprisingly well made. There's a strip club, a beautiful body contest, and a well endowed model. It also has a mad scientist storyline as a doctor tries to find a body for his fiance whose head he saved from an auto accident. And let's not forget that failed experiment behind the labroom door. This is the most complete version available. ADDED BONUS: a clip from the foreign version that features nudity...

...Unlike some of these quartet releases, these movies more or less fit together with REPTILICUS being the only one out of place but at least it's from the same time period. It should have been released with ANGRY RED PLANET and JOURNEY TO THE SEVENTH PLANET as they share the same ""Cinemagic"" connection. I would have made PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES the fourth film as it's in B&W and fits in thematically. Another good revised combo in the series would have been STRANGE INVADERS, INVADERS FROM MARS (the remake), AT THE EARTH'S CORE and WAR GODS OF THE DEEP. So far so good regarding all of these MOVIES 4 YOU sets as they allow some of us to relive our youth while introducing others to the lost art of pre-ratings B movie schlock.",1386806400,,3958,4.759825327510917
5785538,5,B00D9EJFV4,"I bought this DVD just so I would have a copy of Reptilicus (the rest were films I hadn't seen before, pleasant surprises all). It's a keeper!

The Amazing Transparent Man looks cheap (it was obviously done quickly).  The plot involves a megalomaniac (James Griffith) bent on creating an invisible army to take over the world.  Griffith plays him as a slap-happy weasel that I couldn't imagine ever being a major in anyone's army.  He was good with a threat but that was about it.  He coerces a safecracker (Douglas Kennedy) into doing his bidding as the not so amazing transparent man who has difficulty remaining invisible.  Things do not end well for him.  Radiation poisoning, of course.

Reptilicus is a fabulous ""creature on the loose"" flick.  Danish copper miners hit pay dirt in Lapland.....along with a frozen tail they punctured while drilling.  Naturally, the tail soon thaws then regenerates into REPTILICUS!  In the meantime, there's comic relief in the form of a watchman, a brief sightseeing tour (""What a beautiful fountain!""), and a date at a local night club where a tune is warbled.  (Well, they had to stall to give the tail time to grow; these things don't sprout over night!)  A vicious storm takes out the power and allows Reptilicus to escape the ever watchful eye of the watchman.  ""It was so dark I couldn't see my own face in front of me!""  Reptilicus is a fabulous rubber beasty with wings and a cranky disposition.  Of course, the military gets involved and only has one solution, blow it to bits!  They don't make them like this anymore (more's the pity).  Love this movie (pure childhood sentimentality that I can now relive anytime I want to).

The Neanderthal Man is a hoot.  It involves a typical mad scientist (although this one is a tad loquacious and given to rants, believing that no one is his intellectual equal.  ""Stupidity is contagious!"").  Naturally, he will experiment and soon a saber tooth is on the loose, followed closely by a Neanderthal man (guess who!).  All this because the Naturalist Club dismissed him and his cockeyed theories.  ""They laughed at me, me!  They scoffed!""  Look who's laughing now.

The Brain that wouldn't Die features a mad doctor (for a change of pace), who crashes his car on his way to his palatial hideaway/laboratory.  You know what they say, any crash you can stumble away from with your girlfriend's head under you arm is a good crash.  Soon she's one peeved head plotting revenge with the thing in the closet.  All the while, her boyfriend, the mad doctor, is out trolling for babes/bodies to transplant his honey's head onto.  Yes, it is a complicated affair.  Things go awry when he ends up with too many babes and has to scrap the lot for a grateful scar-puss who thinks she's about to get a free facelift.  How gullible can you get!?

5785545,4,B00D9EJFV4,"Mr. Michael Weldon would certainly approve of this 4-pak of schlock Sci-Fi films at such a cheap price. I must admit that I was more than a bit skeptical when I read the reviews that stated 4 films on only 1 dvd could actually look so good. Well, after yesterday, I am no longer a skeptic. At such a bargain price, I was expecting some washed-out public domain prints. But to my surprise, I was very impressed at how well these actually looked. Also, I was completely blown-away at the extras which included still galleries for all 4 films, as well as some additional scenes for the International Version of my favorite in this collection, which is THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE. THE AMAZING TRANSPARENT MAN(1960) was directed by cult director Edgar G. Ulmer. Any film by Ulmer is certainly worth my time and money. It is about a mad scientist who experiments with a serum that makes men transparent. He uses an escaped convict to rob a bank but is stymied by Scotland yard. It is in Wide Screen format with 16x9, 1.66:1 ratio. The transfer is very good to excellent. Next up is REPTILICUS(1962), which is actually in color, and was actually filmed in ""Cinemagic"". It was filmed in Denmark. The frozen tail of a giant reptile is accidently discovered. When it begins to thaw, the creature regenerates into a full-sized monster. The very laughable monster is actually a jerky puppet. What a Howl! The giant flying reptile attacks Copenhagen. The ending of the movie has a surprise twist which I won't reveal here. It is in Full Screen format, 4x3,1.33 ratio. I actually remember seeing this movie in my local theater when I was only 14. Next up is THE NEANDERTHAL MAN(1953). The film is about a scientist who uses a serum that transforms himself into a prehistoric caveman, his cat into a saber-toothed tiger, and his housekeeper into an ape person. This film is also in Wide-Screen format, 16x9,1.66:1 Ratio. Which brings us to one of my all-time favorites, THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE(1962). Talk about Psychotronic! My friend who watched it with me sat with his mouth open for the entire film because he was so astounded! It's about a brilliant surgeon whose speeding car causes an accident that decapitates his fiance. He simply wraps her head into his jacket and takes it to his upstate New York Mansion, attaches some coils and puts the head in a film developing tray. The living head wants to die and talks too much, so he simply puts some tape over her mouth and begins to go body-searching so that he can attach her head to the body. He visits a well-stacked model who poses for photographers in a leopard-skin bikini. Because her face is scarred on one side, he promises to fix it and talks her into going with him to her lab. When his girlfriend finds out, she uses her telepathic powers to summon a giant pinhead mutant locked inside a closet to break out. The mutant-creature then tears off the arm of the crippled lab assistant, kills the doctor by taking a big bloody bite out of his shoulder and spits it out. The creature than sets the lab on fire and then rescues the model as the head laughs and the lab burns down. The movie was actually filmed in Tarrytown, New York in 1959, but it took 3 years before it was actually released. No Wonder! This film is also in Wide-Screen format, 16x9,1:66:1 ratio. I've seen the film at least 10 times in my life and it never ceases to amaze. What I'd never seen before and is included here is the very rare International version which includes nudity of the model. REPTILLICUS is the only film that is in color, as the other 3 are in black and white. At a total running time of 310 minutes, as well as the still galleries for each film, and the restored scene for BRAIN, this dvd certainly delivers more than a little bang for your buck!

8590997,3,B00D9EJFV4,"While I didn't care for the other three movies, The Brain That Wouldn't Die  was worth the price of admission. I found it super creepy. I admit, I scare easy, so maybe this won't creep you out. But the hero/villain was so nonchalant in his evil deeds to carry out his desire to bring his fianc back - her head is the one wired up, keeping the brain alive - and the music so campy ... it was creepy. Hey, nothing is happening here, just looking for a body for my fianc. Everyone go about their business!",1509148800,,502,4.175257731958763

8591000,5,B00D9EJFV4,"What is this? It is what it is, that's what it is, and that is 310 minutes of non-stop entertainment!!! The only film I hadn't seen in this set was ""The Neanderthal Man"", so when I hear any complaints about this DVD, I get all ruffly, you know, in my feathered areas. Why? Because it was worth paying full price just for that one movie, and plus I got upgrades of the other 3 movies, all in one fell coup.

Now, I know not everyone can stand the suspense and nerve-shattering horror of ""The Neanderthal Man"", so maybe they have an excuse for not buying it because their fingers are cramped that week and wouldn't be able to adequately cover their eyes when the shock spills itself out over the screen so fast and relentlessly that they might have to watch ""Last House On Dead End Street"" for a chaser afterwards.

Yes, ""The Neanderthal Man"" changed my life. I'm no longer the same. That was my used-to-be life. I'm living in a post-Neanderthal Man world. The other movies are even better! How can we deny their excellence? We cannot, that's how. Not.

""The Neanderthal Man"" himself put this into my shopping cart (I forgot to thank him for it), but Amazon delivered it to my door so that I did not have to leave my crib thereby potentially meeting the other Neanderthal Men on the street who might have stopped me from seeing this movie! Life is funny that way. Thanks, Amazon. I love movies, and you make loving fun.",1507075200,,1417,4.4423076923076925

8591002,4,B00D9EJFV4,These are B films but still OK. Pretty hokey special effects but fun to watch and laugh over. No special features other than brief photo galleries and a few minutes of extra footage for The Brain That Wouldn't Die.,1504569600,,214,4.512820512820513

8591005,4,B00D9EJFV4,Bought this DVD especially for the Reptilicus movie which I enjoyed but the other three are good too.  I like watching these old horror flics because they remind me of when I was growing up and getting together with the family on a Saturday night to watch monster movies.  They bring back a lot of memories.  If you like old monster movies I recommend this DVD.,1496448000,,361,4.4393939393939394
