407440,4,630186316X,"Corey Feldman and Corey Haim are on top form in this comedy about getting a driving licence.
Corey Haim (Les) fails his driving test (with one of the funniest driving lesson scenes ive seen)and lies to his parents that he has passed.
After helping a girl out at a party (Heather Graham)he tries to con his parents until his mum finds the FAILED TEST in his washing basket.
The girl calls him and asks him out on a date and all manor of trouble results including stealing his Grandfathers prize Caddy which ends up in the hands of the most hilarious drunk driver on the planet.
All the cast in this Movie including Carol Kane and Richard Masuur are excellent.
Older viewers will find the film a little immature for there liking but apart from that good watching",999993600,3,760,4.5144927536231885
407441,5,630186316X,"One of my favourite 80's comic movies, and 2nd favourite Corey Haim movie. Once again Haim and Feldman are teamed up together in a riotous barrel of laughs that just keep rolling out. There is never a dull moment during this film, and the whole cast are remarkable, from Haims twin sister, to his dad, pregnant mum, and even ""grandad"". Even if you arn't a Haim fan, this is a movie you shouldn't miss. It will take you back to your teen days when getting a licence was the most important thing, next to getting your dream date, and getting to relive those excrutiatingly embarrassing moments that you would rather just forget.",985305600,3,626,4.598214285714286

407528,5,630186316X,"For me, this one ranks 2nd after ""The lost boys"". It's a fun and dazzling movie from A to Z and the end happens to be an accurate punchline. Besides, it's always a pleasure to see Corey Haim. I recently saw ""secret admirer"" where he plays a small part.

RIP Corey Haim.",1506643200,,269,4.173076923076923
407529,3,630186316X,This is a pretty good teen comedy.  Corey Haim stars as a typical teenager who thinks he knows everything.  He thinks he's going to ace his driving test.  Only to fail it.  Then doesn't tell anybody.  So they assume he passes it.  Then he  takes his Grandfather's Cadillac out one night.  As he asks himself the age old teenage question.  What could go wrong.  As one disaster follows another.  A very young Heather Graham is his dream girl he's trying to impress..  And her and the rest of the cast do very well in this.,1503187200,,521,4.368421052631579

407678,5,630186316X,License to drive is one hilarious comedy that is a complete blast. Corey Haim and Corey Feldman really shine in this film and while they've always been great at showing their comedic sides this movie shows just how expert they are at it. It has a great supporting cast as well including the highly underrated Richard Masur as Haim's dad in a wonderful comic performance. The gorgeous and extremely sexy (you thought I was gonna say Heather Graham weren't you?) Nina Siemaszko is great as well. This is an extremely fun movie that is perfect for a Friday night watch or any night of the week watch for that matter and it's a movie everyone can relate too in one way or another. The blu ray transfer is excellent but I'm really disappointed that none of the special features from the special edition dvd were ported over especially now that Corey Haim has passed away unfortunately. There were some very funny interviews with him and Corey Feldman on the dvd special features.,1472428800,,974,4.6686046511627906

A fun buddy movie with girl chasing, high school parties, car chases and driving tests. Comic timing is on point from all. A simply laid out movie that works to this day with no fluff thrown in. Not filthy like some of the other teen flicks back then. One of my favorites from the era. No complaints.",1467331200,,467,4.318181818181818

407950,1,630186316X,"Warning! The blu-ray is all messed up. First, they took out the INXS song called New Sensation and replaced it with something else. Also, there is dialogue missing, such as his sister's boyfriend saying ""I'd rather starve"". Also, when Haim pulls out with this car someone yells ""Slow Down! Watch where you're going, you retard!"". In the blu-ray it just says ""slow down"". Another, when they put Mercedes in the trunk she says ""nighty night daddy"" on the vhs, but on the blu-ray she just says ""nighty night"". When Grandpa's Cadillac is hydroplaning and they are in the spin out you can hear Dean saying a prayer...""that is gone on the bluray""!!!

407954,4,630186316X,"You know it's strange.  I've never seen this movie when it first came out nor do I remember even knowing about it until last night, and yet it has this strange feeling of nostalgia.  Can you still be nostalgic for something you didn't know existed based specifically on the time period when it was made?  That's the question.

Anyway this is a typical outrageous 80's comedy.  When the movie begins and you see the dark fainted quality of the picture, the semi-cheesy acting and fast-moving writing, you'll immediately think to yourself ""Wow the 80's dated horribly"" or if you were around back then ""Wow the 80's sure were fun!""  I imagine several 80's comedies that I once enjoyed will have the same feel if I were to go back and watch them now.  The writing was just entirely different than the type of zany comedies that exist nowadays.  Anyway when young Corey Haim (rest in peace by the way- I either never knew or don't remember when he died 5 years ago) sees a knockout girl that he likes (Heather Graham and WOW does she look incredibly different here based on her young age) he insists that he MUST go out on a date with her!

However he doesn't want to come off like a loser or a nerd, so when he fails his driver's exam on the school computer (huh, wish my school offered driving courses) a malfunction happens after he smacks his computer in anger that initially lets Corey off the hook and they automatically pass him (ha!  VERY unrealistic!  They'd NEVER do that!) until afterwards when the problem is fixed and the results come in.  He goes home, wants to tell his parents that he flunked the test but is too embarrassed to admit it... so he says he passed it only for his parents to find out later that he failed.  But he has an important date with Heather so what does he do?  What does a young teenage boy do?  He waits until his parents go to bed, steals his grandfather's '73 Cadillac parked in the garage and goes on the date anyway!

While driving around town he goes on several misadventures.  This is similar to that classic Adventures of Babysitting movie released around the same time but not quite as memorable.  Eventually his friends and Heather Graham are all together... all the while Corey's lying to his friends and Heather about his driver's license.  Hilariously the story takes an unusual turn when Heather has too much to drink and basically acts weird/exceptionally happy and giggly and passes out the whole time while Corey and friends are riding around town avoiding cops, trying to retrieve their car back after an old man steals it, and more.  Heather's role is limited for the remainder of the film to being a silly drunk with Corey's friends taking pictures of her and putting her in the trunk during the cop segment.  It's all very strange!

I also like whenever the father (played by Richard Masur by the way) is forced to wake up in the middle of the night because the wife/mother (Carol Kane) is pregnant and acts just as goofy-headed as Heather Graham, she's constantly wanting Richard to get up and grab her something.  When he walks into the garage, can't turn on the light, grabs a flashlight... only for his wife to reveal she's fine so he goes back to bed, this is hilarious because he *almost* noticed the missing car.  A series of things unintentionally went Corey's way here.  Meanwhile Corey's riding around town without a license, going on an adventure and wrecking the car a little bit at a time while cringing because he knows the punishment will be a big one the next day.

The writing has a refreshing feel to it that only the 80's can provide.  I mean the scene near the beginning when Corey comes up with this idea to persuade his father to leave the car so Corey can drive up to Heather who's walking down the sidewalk as a way to impress her is flat out awesome writing.  What father would actually go along with this plan?  Only movies made in the 80's!  The ending is awesome too- while the events wrap up fairly quickly, it's a series of fairly clever events that I liked. The way the ending unfolds and the credits appear soon after gives me the chills for some reason.  The music that plays here, perhaps knowing Corey died in 2010 to pneumonia and/or a drug addiction, and the way the car drives off... really brings back memories of the 80's despite never knowing about this movie when it was new.  Strange.  Either way a fun story recommended that's for everyone.",1444867200,,4438,4.535175879396985

They did a scary vampire flick in  the lost boys to a romantic comedy dream a little dream but this is their classic comedy  license to drive.  Every teenage boy wants to drive to pick up a hot girl on a date . Corey haim plays Les anderson who is about to take his driving test to get his license  and his smart sister passes and he fails the test because he's  a slacker. So only one knows he failed his sister and best friend played by Corey feildman but  when Les finds out the hottest girl in high school will date him Mercedes played in her first role Heather graham.  Les waits till his dad and mom played by Richard masor & Carol kane are asleep he  steals the keys to 73 cadillac to pick her up what seems like a harmless date and plan what can go wrong . Everything heavy drinking and out of control driving with angry drag racers to insane militants and not to mention a police roadblock all would be fine but Les anderson has no license to drive . this movie is great for any movie collector rip Corey haim  u may not have a license to drive but a license to entertain us.,1432598400,,1317,4.133333333333334
408047,1,630186316X,"License to Drive one of the classic two corey's films from the 80's, 1988 to be exact
still very funny 27 years later i remember watching this alot on VHS

Anchor bay own the rights to this film
they released it as special edition DVD back in 2005 and then re-released again on DVD in 2011
with new Digital remaster 1:85:1 widescreen transfer and anew 5.1 surround sound mix
new special features are added aswell
 you get 2 new retrospective interviews with Corey Haim & corey Feldman only
no new interview with First time Director Greg Beeman, but Greg does do a full length Audio commentary for the film
which is worth listening to he reminisces alot about making the film
no new interview with Heather Graham unfortunately, the 2 corey's talk alot about Heather in the new interview
there's also a vintage making of featurette made back in 1988 to promote the film
both 2005 & 2011 dvd versions have the exact same content just different cover art that's all

and then in 2012 Anchor bay decide to release the film again this time on blu-ray
with all new HD transfer and a new 5.1 trueHD mix
tragically thou not all the extras from the special edition dvd are carried over for some stupid reason
only the Vintage TV making of featurette has been carried over to the blu-ray that's it
no corey's interviews, no new Audio commentary either
the Digital remaster transfer for the dvd looks very Good anyway definitetly better quality than the old VHS version

It is NOT ""LOST BOYS"", but, at least, BOTH, Corey Haim
----and his best-bud----are still alive... and funny in this film.
What a tragic waste of life... Corey Haim seemed to enjoy
acting; and I enjoyed watching t-h-a-t.
This 88-minutes from '88 remind me that MOST of us GET
a little older as time passes. We don't NEED to grow up... I never did.
Back in 1988, I was 39, still in the military, in the BEST condition of my life... I am,
65, but, I am S=T=I=L=L alive. I can watch these guys----then, HALF my age----
and feel like I'm a kid, myself. I'm a BIG little kid; I'm an OLD teenager... great en-
ter-tain-ment, here... the drunk-driver stuff ain't politically-correct... which put ""Otis""
out of work on The Andy Griffith Show. Just take your bitter pill and bite your cheek!

408324,5,630186316X,"One of the most under rated 80's comedies! It's not really a romance, but it's got romantic aspects. It's not really a buddy flick, but Les' (Cory Haim) buddies are major characters. It's most definitely a coming of age flick, but so very much more. Great pacing, exelent characters, quick witted dialog, not to over the top, but just over the top enough, and most importantly... extremely helarious! As someone who makes minimum wage my budget is very tight, but this is eight of the best dollars I've ever spent!",1413936000,,514,4.722222222222222
408325,4,630186316X,"I never got the appeal of Corey Haim. Haim has a slack jawed expression with a deer in the headlights stare and he blinks excessively. At 16 he also had a voice higher than Heather Grahams. On the other hand I was never a 13 year old girl so Im not really his target audience. When he manages to close his mouth hes not a bad looking kid but his acting skills are more in the line with what you might see on a sitcom rather than a major movie release. I suspect the two Coreys, Haim and Feldman, managed to luck into the one period in cinema where they could become sensations. Having now watched License to Drive 26 years after its 1988 release there are a few things that stood out to me. First, this is much more a Corey Haim film rather than a buddy film with Corey Feldman as the posters imply. Second, this film is far better than I expected. It is not a great film but it is very watchable.

After ripping Corey Haim apart I will confess that I thought he did a fine job in the film. His acting is nothing to write home about but he does have a charm and his appeal transcends his limited skills. Its hard not to root for him. What I absolutely did not expect when starting this film was actual laugh out loud moments. The truly funny moments are few and far between but they are well done. When a drunken Heather Graham was writhing around on Haims grandfathers car and the roof starts caving in I was laughing uncontrollably and I give Haim credit because his reaction was priceless. I also got a laugh during the driving portion of Haims driver exam when Haim was told he would have to take the exam while a cup of hot coffee sat precariously perched above the driving instructors lap. I expected a lot of goofy, low brow humor but the film remains more dignified than expected. The scene where Haims dad reveals that he is aware that his son failed his drivers exam was perfectly written and in fact the writing in general is better than in a lot of more highly regarded comedies.

License to Drive isn't an uproariously hilarious movie but what it manages to do is avoid most of the hallmarks of bad movies. The plot is simple but not stupid and I never felt like my intelligence was being insulted. Characters act in fairly reasonable manners and they're likeable which is often not the case in bad movies. Feldman is an ass but hes supposed to be an ass. The movie is totally 80s and if this quality of movie were made today it would likely be straight to DVD but its a fun 88 minutes and if a few moments of profanity were stripped out could almost be a family movie. I think the producers were on to something and if Corey Haim hadnt self-destructed this could have been the start of a fun series of movies. If you haven't seen License to Drive and just assume its just 80s garbage with two obnoxious (and inexplicable) teen heartthrobs this movie may surprise. The ending is a bit trite but overall I quite enjoyed it. Would I want to own it? Probably not but its fun to watch if you have some free time.",1413763200,,3021,4.27972027972028

408735,5,630186316X,"With the recent loss of Corey Haim I've noticed a decent amount of newly released older titles, staring the late actor, gracing the shelves of my local department store.  Of course this is nothing new.  A celebrity passes away & studios generate more income for their previous work (i.e. Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson & Heath Ledger) thus releasing everything they can in response to the recent publicity.  I suppose it's a win/win for both consumers & studios.  After all, true Corey fans can finally get their hands on a few of his obscure 80's films such as Dream A Little Dream 2 & Demolition University (which, by the way, has ""Remembering TheTeen Idol"" prominently displayed on the front cover) but I can't help but feel his death is being slightly exploited here.  I mean, just a few short months ago the License To Drive DVD was out of print, leaving fans of the movie SOL if they wanted to pick it up for a fair price.  I suppose that's show business though....

Nonetheless we have License To Drive on Blu-Ray; my personal favorite Corey's movie.  By now, we consumers, know how this works.  Just because an older film is finally released on Blu-Ray it doesn't guarantee its been given the Blu-Ray treatment.  Transfers can sometimes be atrocious.  Thankfully this is not the case with License To Drive.

Presented in a 1080p picture the images are strong & steady perhaps slightly soft in places but sharp for the most part.  Details are steady with strong clarity and a slight grain structure.  Facial complexions have a soft edge, but generally the texture is satisfactory.  Colors are decent, not exactly vibrant, not exactly dull, which results in an intermediate shading that works fairly well.  Darks are fine, but can't match the deepness of newer titles.  The print itself has been cleaned up removing the dust & nicks that accompanied previous releases.  Truth be told, this is probably the best License To Drive has, or ever will, look... but don't expect Mission-Impossible-Ghost-Protocol-type picture quality here.

Like the picture, sound is good through the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack, but leaves something to be desired.  Music is strong with fair clarity but solid spacing; a noticeable surround element is achieved nicely.  The action scenes toward the end of the movie have all the desructive sounds of automotive chaos; very crisp accuracy.  Certain scenes, however, sound indistinct; like a bus crashing through an alleyway early in the opening chase scene.  For the most part the sound is rewarding, but not top notch.  Still... not too shabby for a 1987 title.

If anyone here is thinking of replacing their DVD version I would say yes, this is a justifiable upgrade; especially for the price.  Corey Haim will be missed by fans, but it's Blu-Ray titles like this that keep his memory alive.  Normally I would give four stars for a Blu-Ray of this quality, but considering what they had to work with & the fact that certain Corey titles have yet to even be released on DVD (Dream Machine) I'm giving it the extra star.  Like I said... this is the probably the best License To Drive will ever get.",1327190400,8,3138,4.836772983114447

They did a great job with this movie considering its age and that it is a smaller film compared to some classics. Detail is great,colors are vivid. There is very little pop ups of dirt here and there but I am very pleased. The sound is good too. You can hear all the dialogue crystal clear and it gets loud when it needs too. I bought this copy since it was a lower price and the Special Edition dvd is so expensive. That being said, however, the special features on this are nill. You get a theatrical trailer and that is all. But if you just want the movie with great picture and sound get this blu-ray. If you have the dvd you may want to keep it for the extras but purchase this for the upgrade. Considering that I bought this,Fever Pitch and Never Been Kissed just this week and the other two films are newer,their PQ quality was poor,especially Never Been Kissed.

Except that the kid fails miserably on his written test. Due to a computer malfunction, he is allowed to take his driver's test, which he manages to pass with flying colors, but he only gets a glimpse of his newly-printed license before the truth of his test scores is revealed and the license is ripped up in front of his disbelieving eyes. Determined to take the test again after the weekend, he leads his parents on with the understanding that he passed his test until then, but they find out pretty quickly about the truth and ground him as a punishment.

Remembering his date with Mercedes, he sneaks out of the house while his parents are asleep and even takes the grandfather's Cadillac, which only has 20,000 miles on the odometer and is in great shape. The date doesn't quite go as expected, since the car is towed, he has to bribe the tow-truck driver with $80 to let his car go, and Mercedes gets drunk and passes out shortly afterwards. So he invites his friends with him for a night on the town, and each encounter they go through ends up with the car getting more scratched and banged up than before, even with a drunk driver stealing the Cadillac, as he thinks it's HIS car, and gives the car a lot of body damage before the guys recover it.

By morning, the car looks like a shattered wreck, and the father is infuriated by the result. But the mom happens to go into labor on the spot, requiring him to drive the parents to the hospital with a bad transmission that only works in Reverse. Everything works out in the end, even with the Cadillac being pancaked by a falling beam at a construction site, because the grandfather happens to return the father's BMW from his trip literally in the same condition as his Cadillac, and the kid, Les, still gets his girl in the end.

Haim plays Les, an overly confident high school student who has just failed his computer generated driving test, even though he passes his street driving test, with a psychotic coffee loving testing instructor, played hilariously by James Avery (Uncle Phil from the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air TV sitcom). His parents finds out he was lying about passing his test, so he's grounded, but can't help stealing the car at night to take out his dream girl, a blonde drunken hottie named Mercedes, played by Heather Graham (Boogie Nights). Along for the ride is his rowdy buddy Dean, played by Feldman. The boys drive themselves into one hilarious escapade after another.

License To Drive is an enjoyable film, and the best onscreen pairing of the Coreys.

I can't help but smile when thinking of film and television icons from the 80s. From The Dukes of Hazzard to Knight Rider, from Max Headroom to Magnum PI. But there were two actors who's body of work pretty much sums up all that was wonderful about the 80's-- Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. License To Drive (1988) is a GREAT film that stars both the Coreys when they were in their prime. With great hair and great 'tude they made this film an unforgettable timestamp of the era. Haim plays Les Anderson who like every high school kid has two things on his mind--cars and girls. But Les doesn't have the hots for just any girl, no, he has his eye on the most beautiful girl in his high school [played by the one and only, Heather Graham.] He finally scores a date with her, but needs to get his Drivers License first. Well, this is where the real fun begins. License To Drive really has it all. It's good clean teenage fun start to finish.

A must have for any fan of the genre or the Coreys.  Definately worth the sticker price.,1132531200,,265,3.8703703703703702

408914,3,630186316X,"Ok, I admit it, I was actually a fan of that 2 Coreys hype back in the day.  As I've been on a quest lately to recaputre my cinematic childhood, I picked this movie up remembering the 2 Corey hype and wanting to see it again with adult eyes.

This movie was actually a lot of fun.  It captures an awkward time in our lives where we are desperate to break free with that just-about-to-get-my -licence feeling.  Driving means freedom and liberation, and like Corey Haim, we were eager.  As he was the one the story evolves around, in the way only an adolescent boy can, without the coveted licence and desperate for the affection of the most beautiful girl in school, he takes the car out for the night.  What could possibly go wrong?

Everything, as it soon ensues.  Near brushes with death are accompanied by many bumps, scrapes and dents in the car, as well as encounters with happy, bumbling characters and his sidekick, Corey Feldman, and that nerdy friend (a well behaved Corey Feldman).  It's not the best movie on earth, no question, but we got to see a younger Heather Graham before Boogie Nights and that she's actually hotter now than then.  After this it was all downhill from there for the 2 Coreys.  Enjoy it for the physical humor and how the disaster unfolds.",1127779200,,1273,4.5152838427947595

408967,5,630186316X,"This is another movie I have been waiting forever to arrive on DVD, ever since DVD's have been invented! So finally I'd love to say it's worth the wait (which it is); however, I don't know why we had to wait for so long for this one!

This is a very campy, cheesy, but enjoyable and loveable movie is about a teenager named Les who struggles to pass his driving test. Once he thinks he passes he's sadly mistaken, but the adventures and the comedy grow even bigger and wilder!!! Plus, I think almost all teeangers can relate 'in a way' and laugh at this film.

By far this is my favorite Corey Haim and Corey Feldman movie. The movie also co-stars the old/new actors: Carol Kane (Taxi, Scrooged, The Princess Bride, & tons more!) Richard Masur (Stephen King's IT, My Girl 1 & 2 and also tons more!), Michael Manasseri as Charles, and beauty Heather Graham as Mercedes. And most might recognize James Avery (Fresh Prince of Bel Air) as Les' DMV Examiner.

The DVD is great. The interviews by both Corey H. and Corey F. are wonderful. They each have different versions of their experiences in creating the film. There's also commentary by director Greg Beeman and writer Neil Tolkin. As well as all of the trailers and deleted scene's. The animation is also great as you flip through all of the menu's on the DVD. I *highly* recommend this film to add to your 80's classic movie collection!

408969,4,630186316X,"The easiest way to tell you about License To Drive is to compare it to similar movies.  It falls into that category of teen comedy adventures that includes ""16 Candles,"" ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" and ""Mystery Date.""  These films each follow the comic adventures of teens through the events of one night, each with a fun atmosphere of romance and risk.  Probably ""American Graffiti"" is the mold for these later films.  License to Drive is not as fine a film as ""Graffiti"" or even ""16 Candles,"" but still fun to watch, and for the most part suitable for the whole family (there's a bit of vulgarity, including the ""F"" word at least once).  The story concerns young Les Anderson (Corey Haim, of ""Lucas"" and ""Lost Boys""), about to apply for his driver's license.  Les's main purpose in driving is to impress the girl of his dreams, Mercedes (Heather Graham).  Some parts of the film are very funny and original, like the sequence where Les and his twin sister take their driving tests.  (One of the examiners is played by Grant Goodeve of ""Eight Is Enough."")  Also Les father's (Richard Masur) tirade near the end made me laugh.  After Les fails his test, he sneaks out anyway for an unauthorized midnight date with Mercedes and a joyride in his grandfather's cadillac.  As Les checks that his parents are asleep, he asks the audience:  ""An innocent girl, a harmless drive, what could go wrong?"" and that's what the rest of the movie's about.  The date get's falling-down drunk early, and when Les stops for help from his friend Dean (Corey Feldman), he's talked into continuing the night out with his freinds - the girl conveniently stored in the caddy's large trunk.  The bulk of the movie concerning the boys' misadventures is not hilarious, but still very entertaining due to the atmosphere of light adventure created by smooth directing (by Greg Beeman, now a producer/director for Smallville), camera-work, editing, and dead-on performances by the entire cast, which includes Carol Kane (""Taxi"") as Les's mother.  Corey Haim brings attractive energy to the role of Les; Masur and Feldman add enough realism to their characters to hold the story together.

Anyone who remembers a time when all our idols were named COREY will love this trip back down memory lane. First off - great cast with Heather Graham in an early role as dream girl Mercedes Lane and Carol Kane as the pregnant mom.  It's a typical comedy, but the director provided enough style and zip to make it all work well.  The driving exam scene is classic, and there a lot of good one liners ""Who would have thought a Mercedes could fit in the trunk of a Cadillac?"".  The DVD includes a deleted sequence with an ALTERNATE CLIMAX.  The whole thing runs about 20 minutes, and shows you how the movie could have ended.  Also you get a funny commentary with the director and writer, and some current intereviews with each Corey separately.  The transfers and audio are top-notch as well!

ORIGINAL (unedited) REVIEW 2003:

Corey Haim & Corey Feldman in the same movie again!!!! OH MY!!!

Yes, if you're a fan of either there is NO DOUBT you'll love this movie, but even if you're not  it is  still a very hilarious and over the top 1980's teen romp!

A 16yrs kid Les(Corey Haim) goes out for his driving test and well... Miserably fails. Afraid of telling his parents he lets them believe he passed until his mom finds the ""Failed"" paper in his clothes while doing the laundry, but that night he still ends up driving in order to take out a girl(a very young Heather Graham) in order to impress her.

 That may not seem very interesting, but it ONLY get's better from there, we get an over the top and hilariously stupid speech about why kids have the right to drive after waiting 16yrs, given by Corey Feldman. If you have seen any of his teen movies before you should have an idea of where this is headed, and how ridiculous it will be.

 This film has some great scenes including a drunk lunatic, as well as Carol Kane in the movie, which is also always a plus. It is outrageously dated and totally unrealistic and silly, and may be one of the silliest 80's movies out there, but I think in one way or another teens can relate to it all while busting their butts laughing at both the silliness of it, the profuse dated lingo, and how absolutely idiotic it is for most of the movie.

It's about a 16 year old dude named Les (Corey Haim, The Lost Boys) who wants nothing more in the world than a driver's license.  Unfortunately, he thinks he knows everything about driving and doesn't need to study for his test.  Is he right?  No way!
The most beautiful girl in his school (Heather Graham, Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me) has just asked him out on a date.  There's only one problem:  He doesn't have a license!  Does that stop him?  No!  He sneaks out in the middle of the night in his grandpa's '72 Cadillac, thinking nothing can possibly go wrong.
