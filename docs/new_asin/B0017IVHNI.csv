8266157,3,B0017IVHNI,"These movies were pretty bad. My favorite of the three was, ""Ants"".  It had good actors and the story was decent.  Actors in this movie include Robert Foxworth, Linda Day George, Suzanne Summers-in her prime, Brian Dennehey.  I'm not sure when these movies were made but I would say they reflected the 1980's.  The packaging was really nice, almost like a collectors set.  If you like 1980's made for TV terror movies then this is the set for you.
The price is right even if you only like one or two of the movies.",1434412800,,514,4.425531914893617
