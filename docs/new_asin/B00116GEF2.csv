8240678,5,B00116GEF2,"Good comedy about a road trip to Vegas.  Upbeat and better than Last Vegas, I think.",1427328000,,84,4.25

8240680,2,B00116GEF2,"Oh dear. Another previews-in-16:9, feature-in-letterbox release. Fitzy (Peter Falk), his crazy crossed-eye, and his four buddies (Rip Torn, George Segal, Bill Cobbs, Billy Burke) make a cross-country road trip, from Florida to Las Vegas, in order to stop his daughter Elizabeth from marrying some French dude. She's only known him 3 months, and is marrying him for citizenship. Turns out he's a ""gerbiler."" I won't explain. Anyway, the guys charter a private bus with their gay driver Antoine, who they wind up ditching with his lover Chris, after they discover them in a compromising position. Antoine and Chris go all Thelma & Louise, and Fitzy & gang are wanted for the disappearance of the bus driver. If you're into golf and/or rap, maybe you'd enjoy this more than I did.",1361404800,,777,4.984615384615385
8240681,4,B00116GEF2,"I bought this film because I'm on a Billy Burke kick and I had to have it.  It turned out to be really funny and kind of cute.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Even my husband liked it.  A bunch of spunky old guys and a slacker 30-something headed to Vegas with the police in tow, what's not to like?",1351468800,,297,3.983050847457627
8240682,1,B00116GEF2,Amazing how bad so many old Hollywood veterans can be when they have a rotten script and lame directing. Everyone involved in this mess should feel ashamed. One of the worst movies ever. Any wonder used copies sell for one penny?,1265760000,2,229,4.609756097560975
8240683,2,B00116GEF2,HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT THIS MANY GREAT ACTORS IN A MOVIE AND GET THESE RESULTS? THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND TALENT.I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!I GUESS THEY ALL NEEDED THE MONEY.....IT'S SAD.,1252713600,,194,4.416666666666667
