8334491,5,B001PS0EYI,"I congratulate the fellas who have counteracted this guy's reviews and cannot add anything that wouldn't sound redundant, for this DVD is perfect in the performance, picture, sound, directing and editing departments. NEIL FORD is deluded and fixated on the keyboardist's looks. He maybe shown on many an ocassion but because the guy IS a key (pun intended) member; he DOES NOT get any more attention than any other member. Sorry this guy will never let him anywhere near you NEIL, frustrating as that may sound.

 You desecrated a perfect performance flawlessly  captured on DVD with your sexual obssession. Hope you're not bigoted anyway either. And you call yourself an Emperor fan ??!! You have some nerve ! Delete your review if you're a MAN.",1323648000,3,746,4.952
8334492,5,B001PS0EYI,"I am writing this to counter another reviewer who seems to have looked a little too deeply into the directing approach of this DVD. By no means did the director do a bad job. This fellow review just seems to disagree on a personal level about it, commenting on shirts and sexual preferences (really, dude?) I also have a keen eye for directing and found that the approach taken did not remove anything from the shear greatness of the performance made by Emperor. It's shot  crystal clear in 16:9 with cameras on booms, cameras on wheels, cameras flying through the air, cameras EVERYWHERE. I feel the director did a wonderful job capturing this performance as a whole and the production is razor sharp. The sound that go's along is earth shattering. Levels are spot on and leave no desire to remaster your EQ. I must say it sounds better then the original recordings. For $11.50 there is NO WAY an Emperor fan should pass this up. I would pay $30 for this if I had to.

  The bonus track is a little over an hour of DV cam recordings of shows and the sound quality compared to the Wacken show will have you fast forwarding a bit, but be sure not to pass the Trym cam that shows him whaling live for about 3-4mins straight. After the live shows Ihsahn and Samoth belt out a few bars of a few songs. It runs for about 5-7mins You can see side by side how smoothly they blend opposite scales into one harmonic, wonderful Emperor sound. There is also a small booklet in closed with full page live shots from the show. I don't know how someone could bash all this for $11.50. For shame!",1260230400,8,1581,4.385665529010239
8334493,2,B001PS0EYI,"Of course, being an Emperor fan, I grabbed this straight away, hoping it would be better than the Emperial Live Ceremony DVD, which is great but short, with a cut between each song. I was disappointed.

The problem is the video direction. Firstly, it's mostly limited to either close-ups or extreme wide shots of the stage, very few medium shots, so you never really feel like you're with the band.

Second, the director obviously knows nothing about Emperor: poor Samoth gets only a couple of brief shots throughout the entire thing ('cause obviously no fan of the band would be interested in seeing a guy standing there playing guitar), whereas the guest keyboard player gets probably as many shots as Ihsahn. Not only is this obviously the wrong emphasis for any fan of the band, but the keyboardist is constantly preening and posing, and wearing a weird flappy shirt. (As a musician he was fine, however, and indeed his high vocals were dead-on and brought out an aspect of the music usually limited to the recordings.)

Because the visual component of the DVD was so disappointing, I now really wish I had bought the CD instead, and that's my recommendation to you.

Apart from the problems mentioned above, it was good to hear one song from Prometheus (In the Wordless Chamber), but I really would have liked to hear more.

The one extra is an hour-long grab-bag of stuff, with no chapter headings or descriptions. There is one really good part, in amongst the shoddy amateur live footage and autograph signings, and that is Ihsahn and Samoth demonstrating riffs for a guitar magazine. With just the two guitars playing, you realise how much of the great music and musicianship has been lost in the mix of the full versions - there's some really great stuff here, and I'd seriously be interested in an album of stripped-back versions like you hear here.",1256515200,2,1859,4.778816199376947
8334494,5,B001PS0EYI,I was so excited when I heard Emperor was going to release their Wacken performance. This is a must have for all Emperor fans. Ihsahn does a wonderful job on his vocals and guitar duties. Samoth as always shredding those notes like crazy.,1254873600,5,238,4.558139534883721
