6243784,5,B00HZ3L25M,"I had originally bought this opera on CD, wtih the same cast, except the tenor, Daniel Behle on the CD and Juan Sancho on the DVD. I am one of those smitten with the baroque ""illness"", more and more theasures are beeing discovered that had been hidden from the public. Vinci seems to have been a very influential composer, unfortunately he died at the age of 34, poisoned with a cup of chocolate due to having had an affair with a married lady!! One can only speculate on his achievements had he lived longer. I enjoyed the CD immensely, these five countertenors are for sure the ""cream of the crop"" today. I was particularly fascinated by Franco Fagioli in the role of Arbace and Valer Barna-Sabadus in the role of Semira. To see them on stage was even more impressive!! I would have to say that the singing was as perfect as you can get it, so was their acting. The others in the cast, Philippe Jaroussky in the title role, Max Emanuel Cencic as Mandane, Yuriy Mynenko as Megabise and last but not least, Juan Sancho, tenor, as the evil Artabano. All performed their roles flawlessly. I have to mentionen the staging, lots of ""theater"" and I really liked they way camera took us backstage. The costumes fitted the content of the opera well, lots of fun to watch. Last, but not the least, the orchestra and the conducting was superb, I have several recordings with this orchestra and this conductor, Diego Fasolis, all very good.
For anyone who is ""into"" early music, this recording is a gem!! I sat for three hours straight and enjoyed every minute!! HIghly recommended.",1401926400,4,1572,4.597864768683274
6243785,5,B00HZ3L25M,"Artaserse -  a forgotten  opera  from the Baroque Era  -  has recently been brought  back to life for  21st century  audiences, thanks to:
- An excellent and very interesting  cast of  characters, played by six male singers, two of them in female parts.  Five of them countertenors, with  one lone tenor and one countertenor playing the two  villains.
- The  Baroque music chamber ensemble,  Concerto Koln,  a  group of musicians that formed in 1985 -  the time when interest in the revival of early music  started to develop, along with the use of  period instruments.
- The Coro della Radiotelevisione Svizzera.
- Conductor Diego Fasolis.
Singers are:  Philippe Jaroussky, as Artaserse prince, then king of Persia; Max Emanuel Ceni as Mandane,  sister of Artaserse;  Franco Fagioli, as Arbace, best  friend of Artaserse;  Valer Barna-Sabadus as Semira, sister of Arbace;  Juan Sancho, the only tenor,  as Artabano,  father of Arbace and Semira,  Prefect of the Royal Guard, and  first villain;  and Yuriy Mynenko as Megabise, General of the Persian Army and confidant of Artabano, in the part of  the second villain.
The other Amazon.com reviewers - all very familiar with the opera and the artists - have already commented on the voices and acting abilities of the six artists,  and additional comments on the subject would be redundant.  Let us rather concentrate on the opera itself.
Artaserse is an opera  in three acts  lasting about three and a half hours.  It is  sung in  Italian with English,  French, German and Italian  subtitles.  The  music  was written  by Leonardo Vinci (1696?-1730 -  no, no relation), with Italian libretto by famous Italian poet and librettist, Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782) -  considered by many as the most important writer of libretti for opera seria .  Vinci was a Neapolitan composer who wrote nearly forty operas during his short life, some  in the Neapolitan dialect - lighter in style, and described as  opere buffe -  the rest in  Italian -  more dramatic, and defined as  opere serie.  Artaserse  was Vincis  last opera -  completed in February 1730, that is  three months prior to  the composers  premature death, and  is generally considered as his  masterpiece.
The story  - like in many  Baroque  operas -  is  built around  real characters, locations and  events  from the distant past.  The characters -  listed above - lived in ancient Persia;  the place is  the royal palace in the town of Susa;  the time is the fifth century BC.  Artaserse (Artaxerxes) is the prince, eventually the king of  Persia, who,  in real life, ruled his country  from 465 BC to 424 BC.  In the opera, he is a very good friend of Arbace, a valiant soldier in the Persian army.  Arbaces father Artabano plots  to take over the kingdom in order to  pass it on to his son.  For that purpose, he kills the ruling  king Serse (Xerxes), while placing the blame on  Arbace who is unjustly condemned to death as a consequence, by his very good friend,  remorseful  Artaserse.  Artabano  then  attempts to eliminate  Artaserse as well by offering him  a drink laced with poison.  Eventually -  as  is often the case in the fictional world  - the truth triumphs, following Arbaces heroic defeat of a  group of traitors,  which  proves his loyalty to the dead king.  To Artaserses delight,  Arbace is set free.  Artaserse becomes king and rules his country as a  just and compassionate leader for about 40 years.
Artaserse premiered on  February 4 1730  during the carnival season,  at the Teatro delle Dame in Rome.  The original opera  was  scored for 2 trumpets, 2 horns, 2 oboes, first and second violins, violas, timpani and basso continuo.  Although further presentations had  to be temporarily interrupted, because of the death of reigning  pope Benedict XIIIs  shortly after (on February 21 1730),  the opera was an immediate  success.  It remained popular for several years  following  Vinci's  death only three months  later - interestingly enough after drinking a cup of poisoned chocolate, similar to the one offered by Artabano  to  Artaserse himself.
Both the music and the libretto were equally praised.  For example,  composer Andre Gretry wrote in his Memoires, ou Essais sur la Musique, that Vinci deserved a statue in the Pantheon for having achieved an ideal partnership between words and music.
The opera then faded into obscurity, and  remained so until its very recent revival,  on November 2 2012 at the Opra National de Lorraine in Nancy, France.  It was then published  - with a 2012 copyright -  as a box set which includes  three CDs and a very comprehensive booklet, with  a  description of the opera and its composer, as well as the complete original libretto in Italian,  with  English, French and German  translations.  It was published again - with a 2014 copyright -  in  the present DVD format,  showing the November 10 2012 performance, with a much shorter illustrative folio which only includes  the credits, some pictures and the a synopsis in French, English and German.
Although the revived opera  has a larger orchestra, an effort was made  to accurately replicate  the original production.  Consequently, listening to and watching Artaserse,  is like  going back about 300 years and discovering an interesting - and very different -  world, a world where women were not allowed onstage, at least not in Rome; where  female roles were  played by castrati males;  where the heroic roles  were also played by castrati males, while the actual male voice (in the range sung by tenors)  was reserved for villains, servants, peasant and other roles  today played by baritones.;  and where the characters wore as much makeup as circus clowns.
Because there are no castrati in this day and age,  countertenors  - whose voice is in a similar  range to that of the  female sopranos - were used in  their place.

When I learned that all six roles in this opera were played by male singers, and that five of them were countertenors;  and when I  saw  the pictures of the various characters - wearing so much  makeup,  I was rather discouraged: it is not very often that we watch operas where female characters are played by male artists;  and where heroic roles are taken by men who sing  with soprano vices and wear  very thick makeup.  But I only had to watch the first DVD  for a few minutes  to remain captivated:  the music was so incredibly beautiful, that I was  glued to the TV set for the entire hour of the first act.
The costumes so typically Baroque in style - with the bright colors, the exaggerated  detail, and the oversize  ornate plumage  - were interesting as well, sufficiently so to maintain my attention - along with the music - during the second and third acts.
All things considered, it may take  time, for anybody unfamiliar withy Baroque opera, to become used to this one.  But  it was an entirely different world then, and  some wonderful works were produced during those time.  The music is beautiful, there is no doubt about it and perfectly conveyed by director Diego Fasolis.  So are the voices and the acting.  So are the staging, the costumes and the production.
Artaserse  may be different, but it more than  deserves the five stars.",1401408000,17,7216,4.838870431893688
6243786,5,B00HZ3L25M,"This DVD had me in tears. What gorgeous voices!
Mind you, there's lots of so-so music, but it's rescued by the singers, in spades.",1401235200,,130,4.458333333333333
6243787,4,B00HZ3L25M,"There are good reasons why you probably don't often come across productions of Leonardo Vinci's Artaserse. Written in 1730, there are the usual musical and staging questions to resolve in how to present opera from this period , but this one is even more rarely performed since it requires no less than five countertenors to sing the extravagantly arranged castrato roles of the work. And not just any five countertenors , but you really need five of the best in the world to be able to do any kind of justice to this particular work.

The arias and ariosos are not long-winded or overly ornamented, but they are demanding nonetheless and really require virtuoso control. Each role moreover clearly has been composed for a specific type of countertenor voice. It can be difficult to distinguish who is who with all the outlandish costume changes, wigs and face-paint - to say nothing of the difficulty of determining role gender - but every single countertenor voice here has their own unique sound and character, and each are outstanding within the role they play. Arbace has arguably the most traumatic dilemma, consumed with guilt over the death of  Serse and unjustly accused of murder himself, Franco Fagioli is outstanding in how he plays out this inner turmoil. It's Philippe Jaroussky as Artaserse however who has to balance the sense of friendship and fairness in dealing out justice with the shock of his father's violent death, knowing that much lies in the balance.

The romantic complications of Semira and her conflicted sentiments would seem less important, but Valer Barna-Sabadus' astonishing delivery will convince you otherwise. This is where the real quality of Metastasio's libretto shows, giving each characters the opportunity to express their sentiments in such a way that the listener is swayed between them and sympathetic to their plight. If you've the right singer in those parts, the effect is even more pronounced, and that's the case here with Max Emanuel Cencic's Mandane, with Yuriy Mynenko's Megabise and even with Juan Sancho's Artebano. The music is exquisite - and it's marvellously played here Diego Fasolis conducting the Concerto Kln from harpsichord - but perhaps not so much that it stands out from other settings of the work or indeed other opera seria works like it. What makes Vinci's version extraordinary is indeed its setting for five countertenors. That is what is so impressive about it, and when it has singers of sufficient calibre, it raises the work to another level entirely.

The direction by Silviu Purcrete plays on what is undoubtedly the unique selling point of this version of Artaserse as being possibly the greatest showcase for the divas of early opera, the castrato. With its extravagant costumes and five lighted theatre make-up mirrors placed to the sides of the stage, there's a lot of preening and posing on the part of all the leads, but there's more to this than just showmanship. It's always a challenge to make a Baroque opera lively and visually engaging, and this one does it by representing its extravagance and its heightened theatrical qualities. Naturalism is not an important factor here. The theatricality of the staging is emphasised by the manner in which this performance is recorded. Aside from the dressing-room mirrors at the side of the stage, the camera occasionally follows character exits backstage, or shows them preparing for their entrance, adjusting costumes behind screens that are being wheeled across the stage by stage-hands. Some might find this distracting, but visually and conceptually it holds attention, and that's what is important.

In the absence of a Blu-ray release, the Erato DVD presents the work relatively well if all you are interested in are the basics of the performance. In terms of technical specifications however it's well below the standard of what is more commonly offered for opera on Blu-ray releases. The image quality is clear and stable, perfectly fine for Standard Definition with the performance spread across 2xDVD-9 discs. The audio mixes are LPCM Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 in 48kHz/16-bit, the sound clear and bright with natural stage echo preferred over pristine clarity. The DVD is region-free, the subtitles English, French, German and Italian. And that's about the best you can say about this release. There are no extra features, there's no booklet, there's no synopsis -nothing. For such a rare work as this, staged so well and unlikely to be revisited anytime soon, that's very disappointing.",1400803200,21,4535,5.106469002695418
6243788,5,B00HZ3L25M,"This piece by the all but forgotten composer Leonardo Vinci was written to glorify the very popular castrati voices in mid 18th century Italy and in this recording we have five very talented ""super-star"" counter-tenors (and one ""real"" tenor - the villain). Such florid displays of vocal technique were all the rage in Italian opera houses at the time and a good castrato could command large fees both in Italy and in other countries where the process of making castratos was banned. ""Opera Seria"" was a literary form in which the plot and its poetry were the admired art and the music was incidental. The story line was supposed to fit within the rules of Aristotle's ""Poetics"". At this time period Pietro Metastasio was considered the greatest ""poet librettist"" in Italy. So his list of ""acceptable"" plots was set to music by dozens of composers. Lest we think all ""Opera Seria"" was stiff and contrived, Mozart wrote two superb masterpieces in the ""Opera Seria"" form: ""Idomeneo"" (Veresco) and ""La Clemenza di Tito"" (Metastasio).
Two Opera Seria of Leonardo Vinci have been revived in recent years with grandiose ""high camp"" productions. In the first ""Partenope"" we have women taking the parts assigned to castrati and here in ""Arteserese"" we have men, counter-tenors, taking both castrati parts and the female roles. In 18th century opera, castrati often sang female parts as well as high male roles written for them. In the present recording the whole enterprise comes off quite successfully and is a good, if long winded, piece of entertainment. The most seriously developed character is the stalwart Arbace who, even when wrongly condemned to death for the murder of Xerses, will not betray his guilty father Artabano. Arbace is played by Franco Fagioli so skillfully and with such depth that it makes the rest of the cast including Jaroussky's beautifully rendered Arteserse, somewhat pale in contrast. All the players are skillful and excellent in their roles as is the staging, costumes, effects and lighting. A special word for the players of the Concerto Koln  and it's director Diego Fasolis - wonderfully played on period instruments. All in all, a very good entertainment!",1398988800,3,2184,5.049861495844875
6243789,5,B00HZ3L25M,"Not for everyone, but considering the number of countertenors and the unusual production of a seldom seen opera this is excellent.  A welcome addition to the baroque opera scene.",1398902400,,178,5.137931034482759
6243790,5,B00HZ3L25M,"This piece by Leonardo Vinci was previously released in 2012 as CD, with a slightly different cast (the tenor role Artabano). This live performance in France was made in November 2012.
I fully agree that Vinci was a major composer, though short-lived.  This work is a true masterpiece, with terrific drama, beautiful arias and unflagging musical intensity. The same plot has been adopted by several other baroque composers, like Arne.  I would however say that while Arne's is good enough, Vinci's by far superior.
The work is a long piece lasting over 210 minutes. So you can see, if it is not top stuff, it simply would have no chance of holding
the interest of any modern audience.  That is the major reason why I did not get hold of the 2012 CD release.
Having sampled this DVD on the web, however, I decided to grab this video, and am very pleasantly surprised by the superlative quality of the performance all round.
First and foremost, the conductor Diego Fasolis is terrific at the pit with his firm grip of the music and drama.  He conducts with highly detailed finesse, and this video allows the viewers to see in certain important moments the interaction between the conductor at the harpsichord and the singers on stage.  The pace adopted by Fasolis and the ensemble is simply perfect.  The dramatic moments are well caught and the music flows with the drama beautifully throughout the entire opera.
Needless to say, viewers tend to focus more on the singers, and in this terrific performance we have altogether FIVE of the greatest countertenors singing on stage today:
Philippe Jaroussky in the title role of Artaserse, here tend to be side-lined by his equally if not even more stunning colleagues in a role that calls for greater vocal lyricism than flamboyancy.  This is hardly justified, for here is one of the finest operatic performance by this great French countertenor.  Jaroussky's superb vocalism suits this role to a 'T' - regal and expressive, he brings out all the conflicts, beweilderment, pathos of this role.  'Artaserse' is a work that centres on human emotional conflicts, and Jaroussky brings the conflicts in the titular hero marvelously with his highly polished singing.  Of the five great countertenors, Jaroussky's Artaserse rightfully clinches the titular crown with a highly focused tonal production, great vocal flexibility and gleaming tone throughout all registers.
Franco Fagioli in the equally prominent role of Arbace receives great accolades from audiences and critics alike, and it is easy to see why.  Arbace is the 'victim' of the entire drama, a role calling for depictions of the great emotional confucsion, if not outright turmoil. This is also a role that requires great moral strength, in no small degree than the titular hero Artaserse.  Fagioli as Arbace is given the most dramatic arias in this opera, and this countertenor does full justice to the role's difficult demands. The spit-fire coloraturas are agilely rendered, and Fagioli owns a tremendous range from chest to head, giving the audience full imagination of the by-gone star castrati's performances.
In the first skirt-role of Mandane, Max Emanuel Cencic paints the Princess's mental and emotional turmoils with great dramatic and musical sensitivity, some thing more difficult than singing a man's role.  Of the two skirt-roles, Cencic is more visually convincing. The Act 1 aria and the Act 2 duet with Arbace are both brilliant vocal portayals of Madane's torture, and the Act 2 outburst against the heartless father of Arbace outright brilliant.
As the sister of Arbace, Valer Barna Sabadus's Semira is a trifle too tall (though not taller than Jaroussky's Artaserse), but his acting is impeccable, and his singing is superlative, if the lower range is weaker by comparison. He is particularly effective in Act II where Semira has to 'tackle' the unwelcome advances of Megabise, reasoning with a dubious brother Arbace and wading off a unreasonable father Artabano.
In the comparatively smaller role of Megabise, Urkranian countertenor Yuriy Mynenko  fully demonstrates that he is not any 'smaller' than the other four.  Owning a very beautiful timbre (imhv evenmore beautiful than Cencic, Barna Sabadus and Fagioli), Mynenko's Megabise is a memorable character, schemy and suave, and his vocal protrayal is particularly outstanding with its slightly metallic tinge on top of a creamily beautiful tone. Definitely a vocal star to watch out for.
Of the entire cast, the only male-voice role is the villain Artabano, sung here in this performance by Spanish tenor Juan Sancho.  I report that this is the only slightly weaker role, but one must not forget that the tessitura for Artabano is punishingly high.  Sancho is otherwise dramatically very effective in this complex role of father/traiter/conspirator.
The production is another 'play within a play', but the sets and costumes are fantastic, and the stage direction marvelous.  The camera catches both the front-stage drama as well as the back stage activities but never losses focus of the main action.
Highly entertaining and unforgettable performance.",1397347200,17,5130,5.160240963855422
6243791,5,B00HZ3L25M,"Waiting for this performance to finally reach DVD was difficult. The CD version was exciting enough, but seeing the characters perform and sing their parts was very rewarding. Although Philippe Jaroussky and Max Emanuel Cencic have been favorites for quite some time, Franco Fagioli was new to me, and he certainly steals the show here with his incredibly agile voice that goes into flights of fancy and never misses. This was an international affair, as has been mentioned. Singers from Croatia, Serbia, Argentina, Ukraine, France and Spain gave their considerable best. The orchestra, under baroque specialist Diego Fasolis, played as if their lives depended on it. The costumes were all-out and great fun to watch. A circle of friends, not into opera, assembled in my house to watch this and thoroughly enjoyed it. They got used to the fact that there were no women in the cast very quickly, after it was pointed out to them that at the time of this opera's premiere in Rome, women were not allowed on the stage in that city.
All in all, a great THANK YOU to everyone involved. I shall return to this disc many times.",1397347200,10,1120,4.778350515463917
6243792,5,B00HZ3L25M,"Let's face it.  Baroque opera is not performed as often as it should simply because it does not lend itself to ""Eurotrash"" productions and most of the works demand exquisitely florid and notoriously difficult vocal fireworks.  Moreover, most of it was written for castrati playing both male and female roles. Here we have a recreation of that period, for 5 of the six principal roles are song by the cream of the cop of today's countertenors, and one lone tenor, representing 6 different countries!  Not a bad one in the group.  It's amazing how fast the contemporary ear can get attuned to their powerful and beautiful voices.  It is thanks to them that a revival of Baroque Opera is now possible. As to the production, I had no idea why stage assistants were part of the action,
but the costuming was both fantastical and androginous enough to hold the viewer's attention.  Do not miss Vinci's other DVD catalog entry, ""Partenope"".",1397001600,9,933,4.8

6243794,5,B00HZ3L25M,"Artaserse is an opera with five countertenors.  This is how opera was in the beginning.  Women were not allowed on the stage and castrati were in abundance.  Thus in the modern times, five countertenors are needed to produce the opera.

An amazing production is the one I watched this weekend.  It is on a DVD from Erato and stars Philippe Jaroussky and Max Emanuel Cencic, two of the best modern countertenors.

At first I was amazed and not sure what to think.  But then you suspend belief and segue-way into the music and theater.  For this is drama supreme and masterful emotion.

Here is the story of the opera:

Artaserse is the name of a number of Italian operas, all based on a text by Metastasio. Artaserse is the Italian form of the name of the king Artaxerxes I of Persia. There are over 40 known settings of Metastasios text. The libretto was originally written for, and first set to music by Leonardo Vinci in 1730 for Rome (Artaserse). It was subsequently set by Johann Adolph Hasse in 1730 for Venice and in 1760 for Naples, by Gluck in 1741 for Milan, byChiarini in 1741 for Verona, by Graun in 1743 for Stuttgart, by Terradellas in 1744 for Venice, by Galuppi in 1749 for Vienna, by Johann Christian Bach in 1760 for London, by Josef Mysliveek in 1774 for Naples (Artaserse), by Marcos Portugal in 1806 for Lisbon and many other times. The text was often altered.

The version I watched was the original by Vinci from 1730.  There is that simple yet complex music of the 17 hundreds; there is that overwhelming emotion of times past; there is that complexity of human desire; and there is that complexity of love and desire that today is condemned.

As one reviewer puts it:

Prohibitions against women on stage also, however, allowed Romes composers to explore ambiguities surrounding gender and orientation. The plot deals with the moral education of an absolute monarch. Artaserse, king of Persia, must bring his fathers murderer  in reality Artabano  to justice. But the main suspect is Arbace, Artaserses closest friend and lover of his sister, Mandane. Emotions, whether verbally defined as love or friendship, speak the same musical language here, and it is soon apparent that Artaserses feelings for Arbace run deeper than his affection for his own fiancee, Semira.

The part that got me was that the father is the murderer of the king.  His son is accused of the murder.  But the son refuses to speak against his father.  The father plays a dangerous game of condemning his own son to death for the murder, and the son suffers.  Do we as fathers thus condemn our offspring to their fate in favour of our own benefit?  I asked this of myself this week as I watched one of my kids repeat the follies I perpetrated so many years ago.  How to stop them repeating the past?

No way!  They just have to learn as I did.

This is a beautiful opera with beautiful and ugly males in all roles.  They challenge your notions of gender and generosity.  They challenge your notions of good & evil, and the conflict between personal and filial benefit.

This is not for the faint of heart.  For the action is brutal and beautiful.  The singers are superb and disconcerting.  The dress is a pastiche of male, female, neutral, and obscene.

But above all the music shines.  You tap your foot.  You beat the drum.  You dance in delirious dance.  And you howl in human pain & conflict.

Take a full bottle of brandy to watch this.  It helps through the drama and delirium of voices like nothing you normally hear but which must have been common three hundred years ago.  And which today is a joy of indulgence.

Here a bit about the composer:

Born in 1690, Leonardo Vinci was based in Naples, succeeded Alessandro Scarlatti as vice director of the Royal chapel in Naples and was a teacher of Pergolesis. Thanks to his friendship with Metastasio, Vinci became, alongside his rival Porpora, a pioneer of the Neapolitan opera seria, with special attention to the natural setting of text. Vincis influence on Handel is clearly heard in Artaserse. Vinci died young in 1730, apparently poisoned by a jealous rival in a love affair that turned sour.

To get a brief encounter with what you are missing or might want to avoid see this bit from YouTube.  Or better this bit.  Whatever it will challenge you.  Enjoy.",1410652800,3,4314,4.646825396825397
6243795,5,B00HZ3L25M,"5 countertenors and 1 tenor. Franco Fagioli is amazing here.

The staging has dressing room mirrors along the side of the stage, and during the overture the stars stand at the front of the stage in robes and I kind of wasn't that excited about some of the Back Stage aspect of the production, but it's a minor complaint, and at times it kept things moving. The outfits were decent after they started to get dressed though, but seeing them in robes during the overture was underwhelming at the beginning.

Leonardo Vinci is a decent composer too. I hope they produce more of these types of revivals.

No Spanish subtitles. The opera spans 2 DVDs and comes with a booklet. There was no ""Making of"" featurets or anything, that would have been nice.

Previously only through Opera Rara,, a British Foundation committed to reviving these masterworks and recording them on CD's, were they available to non-musician scholars and researchers.  Lately,this genre has been trickling down to the DVD format to my joy and delight.  The particular cast assembled for this DVD are not the headliners we are familiar with or know from performances; but, these counter-tenors (the entire cast, male and female roles) are all masters of their art. Forget the plot and just enjoy the virtuosity and emotional intensity and brio of the voices and the imaginative direction and staging that moves what could have been a static performance toward a very much alive performance. The set, staging and costumes are wonderful. The make-up is at first a bit startling, but, once you get used to it, it fits in right along with the entire effect mounted for this GEM. We are taken back to anther time and style most lovingly done up to perfection grounded in 21st century mind-set, using all the creative talents most effectively. Back in the times when this sort of opus was all that was, women were not allowed on the stage and the castrati were a common lot, produced in accordance with the religious ignorance and demands of the time. The voice was to sound angelic and angelic meant the Soprano and Alto range. I suppose the devil had to be a basso profundo. The castrati were the idolized rock stars of their time and much sought after by ""straying ladies"" because they (mostly) could ""function"" but not produce progeny.",1407801600,3,1676,4.795847750865052

6243800,5,B00HZ3L25M,"This was Brecht's verfremdungeffekt carried to its logical conclusion.  As is usual in these ""concept-centric"" productions the work and why it ought to be performed get lost.  Much of our understanding of the work falls victim to this gimmick or that.  If one doesn't trust a work, one should not stage it.  The cast is brilliant and when they let rip with an aria, chills go up one's spine.  That's what the composer intended and it shouldn't have to happen in spite of the production's attempts to prevent it.",1402704000,,511,4.696629213483146
6243801,5,B00HZ3L25M,"21st century is rightly described as the 'B' era for operas (as opposed to the 'V' era of the last century).
'B' certainly refers to baroque and bel canto ('V' for verismo and Verdi).
In 2012 here, we have this out and out the most accomplished baroque opera production ever.
Other reviewers have pointed the individual singers' terrific contributions.  Let me now describe some of the high points. Of course, the 'high points' are available on the web, but you'd have to watch them in context to get a complete taste.
There are quite a good number of vocal high points - foremost, the absolutely incredible Franco Fagioli, owning a technique not one jot less than Cecilia Bartoli, but with a male-sounding and full-throttled dramatic CT timber.  This is both a gift and an acquired art.  Full credit to Franco for his several great arias and duets, especially the last number in DVD 1, in which he really sung (and acted) his heart out the torments of Arbace.  A completely stylish rendition, too, fully in sync with the Rococo style of the opera's production.
Also vocally and dramatically outstanding is Philippe Jaroussky as Artaserse himself, drawing on one of the CT star's finest operatic performances (comparatively, his earlier Orlando Furioso and L'incoronazione di Poppea are less eminent, for sure). Vocally in resplendent state, Jaroussky portrayed a regal yet tormented title role, as memorable as the Arbace of Fagioli.
No less stunning are the other counter-tenors' performances, though.  This production has two 'skirt roles' in Semira (Valer Barna-Sabadus, sopranist) and Mandane (Max Cencic, mezzo-sopranist). These two men gave jaw-dropping performances as 'women'.  While you may not feel at all convinced in video close-ups (the make-ups are really heavy for dramatic effect), but judged as a stage performance, both Valer and Max gave utterly incredible performances in their respective lady-roles. Max skips and jumps on unbelievably nimble feet to the music of Mandane, greatly enhancing the dramatic effect of the arias/duets/scenes. Valer is no less effective, for although taller and slender, he manages to glide through the scenes where his Semira is being tortured. In the hit scene in which Yuriy Minenko's Megabise sings an aria to molest Semira, it is a typical setting of a black Turkish falcon out to rape a white dove. Minenko's singing and acting are both impeccably effective, but the scene's dramatic effect is greatly improved with Barna-Sabadus acting.
Giving in bygone years (may be just 5 years ago), Minenko would have been heralded as the new Counter-tenor big found with a strikingly rich timber and tremendous stage presence (compare Bejun Mehta, with whom Minenko has no small similarities by way of strengths).
As it is, this compilation in its sheer gathering of vocal and operatic talents makes this production the best operatic DVD of the past decade.",1402531200,2,2903,5.1528662420382165
6243802,5,B00HZ3L25M,"What do you think you will make of an opera in which five of the six solo roles are sung by counter-tenors and there is not a female singer in sight or sound? Does that description make you shake your head back and forth, or nod it up and down? Well, I can understand why you are not nodding an affirmative, but just allow me to put forward the case for an enthusiastic Y E S!  P L A Y IT!
The costumes and stage set are based on 18th century models but they are so stylized, so exaggerated, so flamboyant that they strike the viewer as bizarre. And the gestures and movements that animate this succession of solo arias ad infinitum are equally stylized ands thus bizarre. Have I lost you? Well, I loved it, every moment of it for the duration of 201 minutes - that's 3 hours and 21 minutes! First of all, the music is gorgeous and reflects unfailingly the complex and extremely varied emotions of the principals. The singing of the counter-tenors is precise, exacting, inventive and (YES!) beautiful. I was familiar with Philippe Jaroussky from two previous productions - he is justly famous and honored. But in this production, Franco Fagioli had the most tragic role, torn between competing loyalties, willing to die rather than betray either loved one, his role achieved the pathos of neo-classical tragedy.
In two arias, he hits a high note which has to be heard to be believed. I went into the same frenzy of admiration as the audience. But the other two counter-tenors singing female roles also have lovely arias they sing with grace and conviction. I have played this two cd set twice now, and I am nodding my head enthusiastically to my heart's suggestion we listen again. It's that wonderful.",1402099200,3,1702,4.598684210526316

8637407,5,B00HZ3L25M,"The production left a bit to be desired--at one point, a performer pours water from a plastic bottle into a glass and gives it to another performer mid-opera...  The Exit sign on the stage is fully visible and makeup is done on stage as well.

This, admittedly, was my first Baroque opera experience, so perhaps it's the norm?? Cenic and Fagioli stole the show, I'd say, in terms of their performance and emotional display. Jarrousky's portrayal just didn't come to life for me and felt a bit vapid. Singing was great all around but again it was Fagioli who I compulsively watched again and again (while also trying hard to ignore some of his  facial contortions, which were a bit distracting).

I never watch DVDs twice, but I think I'll be watching this one many more times in the future.",1429660800,,790,4.621428571428571

Seriously, though, I enjoyed it tremendously...and will just about guarantee that you will, too. Plot is a little convoluted (well, characters a bit hard to keep straight at first) and, well, it's Baroque...guess you had to live then to understand.  (Truly a period opera, though....certainly not Puccini.  Not to take anything away by that comment, but this is an opera that you probably will never ever get to see performed.)  If you're reading this to try and decide whether to drop the cash for the DVD, just do it.  You won't be disappointed.",1421452800,,697,4.798319327731092
