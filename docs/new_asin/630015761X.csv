The bright colors and animation from this dvd are as memorable as when I saw it so many years ago. If you have not seen Rainbow Brite before and you enjoyed shows like Smirfs, Pokemon, and Dragon Ball, then I recommend taking a go at Rainbow Brite.

215332,5,630015761X,"Rainbow Brite And The Star Stealer is a Japanese/American animated film from 1985. It is considered an American film, but it was animated in Japan.

The film takes place in Rainbow Land. Rainbow Brite and the citizens do everything they can to bring life and color Earth. Rainbow rides on her horse Starlite and travels using a rainbow road that is created as Starlite runs. Rainbow also has a magic belt that throws rainbows. In the film, Rainbow and Starlite meet a robotic horse called On-X who comes to Rainbow Land to ask Rainbow for help. We find out that the diamond planet called Spectra is in danger. Spectra is the life of the whole universe, and if the light is covered, everything in the universe will be destroyed. An evil princess wants the entire planet to herself, even if it kills her. Rainbow must meet up with a boy named Krys, and a Sprite named Orin in order to earn the power to stop the princess and destroy her magic jewel.

I saw this movie many times as a kid, and I always loved it. It's a pure Saturday Morning action cartoon. If you love that style, then I'm sure you'll love this film.",1373155200,,1115,4.434146341463415

I'm so happy to know I'm not the only person who can still appreciate the value of more innocent days gone by.
As soon as I got it, I forced my friends to watch it with me. By the end of the movie, all of us were able to appreciate it for the memories it sprung back up for us. I can honestly say I am enjoying just as much now as I did 20 years ago. :-) Great purchase!",1281312000,,690,3.832167832167832

It's a wonderful story of determination, courage and cooperation between many people that helps to bring light back to the world. However it was made in the 80's and can be a little on the silly or childish side. But for those of us who still have that child like innocence you will find this movie both fun and meaningful.",1266796800,,454,4.2298850574712645

But seeing it now, I think it's adorable! Cartoons from the old days had a certain goodness and adventure to them. Nowadays, cartoons still have good messages but they're so bland I don't see how anyone can stand them.

I like the Evil Princess in this movie, especially with her pet rock (hey, a diamond's a rock). It always makes me laugh at that part when she ""walks"" it.

It may be a little over $10 but it's well worth the price for the quality. Mine doesn't skip at all, and if you get it new it will last. Definitely worth the money.

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to fly on the rainbow with Starlite, Twink, and the Color Kids. Plus -- it's a classic! A must-have for RB fans.",1217462400,,600,4.2

My main problem with this movie is that the evil doer is this bratty teenager character who is being persuaded by this guy to do a lot of the evil stuff she is doing. This gender dynamic really bothered me. Usually when I watch movie/read books from my childhood, I try to keep an open mind, but a lot of the stuff in this movie just didn't seem cool to me.

If you loved Rainbow Brite as a kid, definitely check this movie out. Relieve a bit of your childhood. If you are thinking of introducing Rainbow Brite to your kids, watch the movie first. The movie definitely isn't horrible, but I have definitely seen kid movies that had a better script and less gender stuff going on.",1200960000,,846,4.254658385093168

I'm 24 years old now and my crush/love/infatuation with her was restarted this past January, and when I heard that this movie was released on DVD I was stoked, I'd definitely reccomend it for the little ones though.",1156896000,2,485,4.170212765957447

215409,3,630015761X,"As the only Rainbow Brite title available on DVD, I'll take what I can get. Rainbow is surprising adventurous and fearless -- and much less cloyingly sweet than I remember. Think of her as ""Baby She-Ra""!

This movie feels like it was supposed to attract boys to the franchise as well. It introduces a new male lead, Krys and his Knight Rider-esque horse, On-X. This movie also has more robots, monsters, and scary lizard people than you would expect from a movie aimed at young girls. And thankfully, there is only one musical number at the beginning of the movie.

The animation is crisp and clean. The transfer is surprisingly vivid for a 20 year old movie. This may have been many viewer's first exposure to anime, as this beat Transformers: The Movie to the theaters by a year. And Akira wasn't released until 1988. The high detail/low frame rate is a signature of Japanese animation. And this has the same production values of mid-80s anime.

Like many 80s children cartoons, character motivation and plot aren't always coherant. It's never explained why the Princess wants all these jewels. (where are her parents, anyway?) There are some funny scenes involving her and her pet gemstone she drags around everywhere. Might be a little scary for very young children. But I think it's a fun movie for nostalgia-hungry Gen Xer's as well as young children of today.",1151193600,9,1366,4.804255319148936

The series was filled with magic, music, and appealing characters.  I was especially mesmerized by the beautiful horses, who are drawn better than their human counterparts!

This movie introduces some new characters without losing the feel of the series.

From Rainbow Brite awakening and setting out to restore a colorful spring after the long winter (racing Stormy for the right to do so), to the arrival of a strange robotic steed with a plea for help.

Can Rainbow save the planet Spectra from being added to a spoiled Princess's collection?  If she fails, the results could be catastrophic!

When my mother rented this movie for us to watch I said ""No way am I watching this girly...oh there's a robot horse that flies in it and a boy who's wristband shoots lasers?""
As mentioned by another review, the best thing the creators for this movie could have ever done was to leave out all of the usual characters of the normal series and send the main ones to another setting. A healthy dose of more menacing villains, travel to a different dimension, cooler ways to get around, and characters armed with other things besides rainbows, dark clouds, or happy thoughts, means that this movie is suprisingly offbeat from the series.

It was just the bomb.,1059868800,,362,3.84
215456,5,630015761X,"That is Rainbow's answer to Chris's observation that her ""stupid horse can't even fly without"" the power of her rainbow.  My other favorite quote is by the little sprite, Orin, as the two kids prepare to leave for the final encounter, ""Be Brave! Be Bold! and Don't fight with each other!""  You probably know the plot by now, so let me just add my own observations.  Rainbow's usual nemeses, Murky and Lurky, seem to have little more to do than running around through the plot trying, without success, to cause trouble, resulting in being some needed comic relief.  Slightly two-dimensional, but leaning on the Wiley Coyote side, however they do not cross that line to annoyance.
Speaking of two dimenional characters, the main enemy of the story appears well, rather shallow, but I'm guessing is just a reflection of some of the spoiled young children watching the show, perhaps some sort of message there..  However, I absolutely love the Evil Princess.  Why?  She's so delightfully insane.  One minor example - throughout the movie, she has a ""pet rock"" a popular fad in the 80's in the form of an emerald the size of a football.  She coddles it, comforts it, even scolds it when it ""disobeys"" her.  After throwing it in her chair herself, she yells at it, ""No one sits in my throne but me!""  This self-absorbed delirium is consistent throughout the whole film, it's wonderful fun to watch.
The animation is great for it's time, compared with He-Man and other contemporaries.  The lines are soft, and there appears to be no repeat animation.  The happy and safe scenes are alive with beautiful color, which quickly disappear once things get dark and serious.  I would love to read a book by the creators of this show about some of the hidden messages and art of the show.
Final Analysis: A strong, brave, but belivable, not over-the-top heroine, and an equal male counterpart star in this loveable film.  The suspense is believable, and the movie can appeal to people of all ages, and maybe some mature boys too ;-).  I wish this wasn't the end of the story, I'd love to see more of Chris and On-X, and Stormy and the other Color Kids.  Just have to be satisfied with getting hold of the other 13 episodes.  Wish me luck!",1054339200,4,2223,4.656410256410257
215457,4,630015761X,"Rainbow Brite was one of many 80's toy fads to make it to the big screen alongside such diverse franchises as Care Bears, My Little Pony, Transformers, He-Man, and G.I. Joe.  Although other films may have been more commercially successful, Rainbow Brite was certainly one of the better done ones.
The story is that a spoiled Princess wants the biggest diamond in the universe--through which all light must pass.  Her efforts to encricle it with nets are blotting out light on Earth, leading to a long, depressing winter whereupon people everywhere are simply giving up.  Though impossibly implausible--every kid old enough to watch the film already knows that light comes from the sun--the story is no more silly than anything else having to do with a girl who creates rainbows.  Just accept it and you'll enjoy the film.
One problem filmmakers have always faced with television adpations of toy lines has been the number of characters present.  Toy makers want to maximize the number of different toys they can sell, whereas good stories necessitate smaller casts.  The film focuses on Rainbow Brite, her horse, the villians (with Murky & Lurky playing second fiddle to the Princess), and a headstrong boy & his robotic horse as Rainbow's allies, which works rather well even if neglecting those who may favor a character besides Rainbow.
The movie mostly appeals to girls (as did the toys), and its heroine and the motifs present reflect that audience.  However, I did enjoy this movie along with most other cartoon toy adaptations as a youngster.  If you enjoy 80's cartoons, toy adaptations, or are just a fan of Rainbow Brite, you'll enjoy this movie, too.",1047945600,11,1661,4.9496402877697845

215495,5,630015761X,"I don't think there can be any doubt that this movie perfectly captures the essence of what it means to have been a child of the eighties.  Here in abundance are the spunky characters, the bright colours, the deliciously cheezy music and the bright-eyed idealism that characterized so many eighties cartoons.
Adorable heroine Rainbow Brite is on a mission- to defeat the Dark Princess (a villainess characterized by her terrible vanity and selfishness, as well as a dislike for children), who is out to steal the diamond-planet Spectra, the very light of the universe.  The resulting adventure is a cheery, kid-friendly version of the classic fantasy- the quest, the small-but-determined heroes, the wise mentor, the struggle of good versus evil- that crosses the universe and brings together an impressive array of heroes and villains, both big and small.
All of the well-loved characters from the television series are here, from Rainbow's faithful horse Starlite to lovable bumbling badguys Murky and Lurky, as well as all of the colour kids, Twink the sprite and Earth-boy Brian, plus an assortment of terrific new characters.
An old favourite of all eighties children, the re-release of this movie couldn't have been timed better.  We're all on the verge of being grownups now, and hungry for reaffirmation of the things we once believed, the things that, somewhere inside, we believe still- that we really can defeat evil with only imagination and teamwork as our weapons, and that we can deal with anything in the world, so long as we have light and beauty around us.
Not only a nostalgia piece, Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is filled with all of the adventure, music, and imagination that make a great children's movie- even for those who are too young to remember the cartoon.",1004054400,,1791,5.003355704697986

215497,5,630015761X,"My Goodness! Just when I thought that this movie was out of print I come across this wonderful link at Amazon.com!  Oh, how I could kiss them!
If you are looking for an 80s cartoon to bring back the good ol' days in animation you can stop here and click the ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button, because you have found THE most perfect 80s cartoon of all time. People of all ages, male or female will love this movie! Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is full of colorful animation (excuse the pun) and great songs that just make you want to get up and dance like it's the 80s all over again.
Rainbow Brite must deal with her greatest adversary yet: an evil Princess who wants to take the greatest light in the world and keep it to herself, thus causing all of the color to disappear from the world. (no light = no colors!) This is an even bigger job than trying to fight Murky or Lurky! Along the way, Rainbow Brite meets a new friend and she learns that working together really does help. Only friendship and unselfishness can save the day!
This is a rare treat to find on the web, so if you really must have an 80s cartoon to keep you going, THIS IS A MUST HAVE! It definitely made my day (as it will over and over on my television set for years to come ^_~)!!",993513600,87,1257,4.172839506172839

The animation is really cute and brite, and is backed up nicely by a great score. I love this film and still remember my mum renting this out for me over and over again along with ""Labyrinth"" as a treat. HEY, that was 11/12 years ago! YET I still love it! Don't let Rainbow Brite die, they might have only made 13 forgotton episodes of the actual show, but buy this movie for your kids and the rainbow will never fade ;)",990576000,2,575,4.1891891891891895
215499,5,630015761X,"Have you ever noticed that a good chunk of 12-15 year old girls get starry eyed and giddy when someone mentions ""Rainbow Brite"", ""The Carebears"", ""Jem And The Hollograms"" or ""My Little Pony""? I have. And why is this? Because I'm one of those 15 year old girls. I grew up on this Rainbow Brite flick. My mom used to put it in to occupy us (us being me and my 7 brothers and sisters) on rainy days. I see old Rainbow Brite dolls in thrift stores and in garage sales. I think immediately of this movie and of my childhood. Mention Rainbow Brite and I'll flash back to 80s world, as will almost anyone else. This film is great for anyone who misses the 1980s. The time when cartoons weren't full of violence and harsh language (ie: south park...) Yes, yes. Rainbow Brite. Didn't she just rock the world. *sigh* And also, anyone into Anime (Sailor Moon, Cutie Honey, Card Captor Sakura) will adore this.",985392000,3,898,4.4156626506024095

215512,3,630015761X,"Those that remember anything about the 80s probably recall this mid 80s flick centering around Rainbow Brite having to save the Earth (in one way or another).  Some cheesy moments, and definitely not as dark as movies to come from the earlier 80s (but then again this is RAINBOW brite and rainbows aren't very dark are they?)  Not as sickly sweet as the Care Bears (which were sweet in a good way but still...) there's enough storyline to capture the attention of most anyone and I remember watching this one hundreds of times, like most of the animated fare that the Disney Channel showed before turning into a cheesy pre-teen tv programming network.
Of course Rainbow Brite ends up saving the day, but not before she teams up with a boy and his robotic horse and engaging in a few other onscreen antics and galloping across the galaxy upon arching rainbows.  As in most 'cartoon movies' from this period, you can't end the tale before the fantasy characters interact with some real world children as well.  Cliche, but hey its expected (isn't that what all cliches are about?) As far as US market animated flicks go this is among the best (despite the fact that Rainbow Brite is actually a product of the Japanese that bring us glorious anime - but then again Im not surprised!)",974764800,2,1280,4.650442477876106

There's just something about Rainbow Brite that clicks with some people and makes them happy. For some reason, she just makes me feel good. Besides that, it's a fun movie, and not half as cheesy as Care Bears (which I like okay) and not a millionth as cheesy as Strawberry Shortcake (whom I can't stand)",970012800,4,432,4.345679012345679
