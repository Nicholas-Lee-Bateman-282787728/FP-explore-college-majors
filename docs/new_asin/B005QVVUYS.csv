8483836,5,B005QVVUYS,"As far as I know, this DVD is the only available visual recording of a Kevin Coyne concert. As such it stands as a unique reminder of the great musical and lyrical capabilities of a musician perhaps now largely forgotten. Though performing without a band, supported on some songs by Zoot Money, Coyne still manages to excite and captivate with his unique presentation, style, and subject matter.
A great voice, great playing and tunes, and some challenging song topics, provide a brief insight into the this man of quite remarkable and individual talent. In an era of cloned and imitative music, kevin Coyne created a musical identity of complete individuality, tapping into a world of insightful sensitivity that at times confronted and challenged his audience.
The audio and video quality of the DVD are acceptable, the performance is excellent. If you Know little/nothing about Kevin Coyne, this DVD makes a fine initial entry point. But be aware, once Coyne has found your heart's ear you will likely end up a true believer, and spend much time searching out his back catalog of albums.
Kevin Coyne live DVD is a fine legacy, it should be in ever serious listener's collection. I just hope more of his material can be found and made available on DVD.",1369526400,,1254,4.864485981308412
