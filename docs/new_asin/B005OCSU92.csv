8481184,5,B005OCSU92,"I have to start by saying that I do not have the BluRay version, only the deluxe version DVD, so this review is of the content of the concert and not the quality of the BluRay disk.

Let's face it, UVERworld DVD's are not cheap, because they come a long way and the exchange rate hasn't been favorable.  But if you have a wish to own the quintessential UVERconcert DVD, or if you can only afford one of their DVD's for your collection, let it be the Last Tour Final from Tokyo Dome.

First of all, the sheer scale of the performance is impressive. For baseball games, Tokyo Dome holds something in the neighborhood of 42,000 for baseball games and I believe that for concerts the seating is approximately 56,000. This show was sold out to the rafters.  At one point in the background material, Takuya-san walks all the way to the farthest back seat at the top of the stadium to get - and give - an idea of how small the stage looks from there.  Five huge projection screens were placed above the stage, one to focus on each band member, as well as to contribute to the stage show - which is just about the best designed show their people have come up with to date.  In addition to the main stage (which features a hydraulic platform holding a complement of a dozen strings to supplement Qualia and a few other choice numbers), there is an below-seat-level tunnel leading out to a second hydraulic stage that raises up smack in the middle of the orchestra seats. This has a complete second drum set and room enough for the band to perform on.  There are also ramps and other smaller 1-person hydraulic platforms situated on either side of the stage, all geared towards giving greater exposure to the spectators who weren't lucky enough to be up front.

The second reason to own this DVD is that at the time of writing (April 2012, so I'm including the newly issued Christmas 2011 at Budokan DVD), this is the only one that includes the ENTIRE concert from start to finish - no numbers edited out. After 6 CD's, they are getting hard pressed to fit the new material plus old favorites into each show, but this is about as good a mixture of material as you're going to find. (The AwakEVE tour DVD also has a good mixture.)  It also includes the special end-of-tour montage that was put together for the final show, recognizing all those who contributed; this is set to Mondo Piece, which was written for this purpose but turned out to be very popular. The camera remains running beyond the end of this presentation until the very last person leaves the stage (and that moment in itself is worth seeing).

The camera work on this was good, in my opinion.  There have been parts of the previous concert DVD's where the scene shifts so quickly from one band member to another that it gets a bit frustrating.  I also don't care for too much time wasted on the audience's reaction, although I don't mind seeing a little of that.  I also want to see good coverage of the group, of the individual members and of the lighting effects and/or video screen presentation if they've put together something specific for a song.  This show has captured all of that in a satisfying format.

UVERworld themselves are in extremely good form for this show - no surprise there. There is a fabulous break where, after Qualia and an exquisite accoustic version of Kimi no suki na uta, everyone else leaves and Shintarou-san carries a fairly lengthy MC by himself (which the audience loved.)

For those who are interested, the deluxe edition includes a portion of the performance at a venue called Drum Logos in December 2010. This is not only adds  two songs to the DVD, but it presents a striking contrast in the types of venues these guys play while on tour. Drum Logos appears to be a fairly large nightclub with no seating up front and the occasional technical difficulty interfering with the performance.  There is also a behind-the-scenes piece that's quite good (I'm not sure if this bit is on the regular version or not).
