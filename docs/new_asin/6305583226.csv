1054647,5,6305583226,"I'm only 15, and I was lucky enough to find the Serial Experiments Lain DVD Lunchbox set, which contained all four DVD volumes of the series packed neatly inside of a Palisades lunchbox.  But enough of that.  I got interested in Lain mostly for the story alone.  It's understandable that some people may not like it, considering the fact that it does contain content not suitable for those under the age of 13.  However, what fascinates me the most about this series is both the storyline and extensive research put into it.  What I mean by research is exemplified in Layer 9: Protocol, where they happen to mention conspiracy events such as the Roswell Incident, and people like Vannevar Bush who was an alleged member of the Majestic 12.  I also enjoyed the character designs because the characters are somewhat ""real"" in personality.  This series can be compared to The Matrix, which also has some very deep and dark insight about our world.  True, the pacing is slow, but I believe the creators did that on purpose so that the viewer could experience EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of what was taking place on the screen.  Serial Experiments Lain is like a reflection of our society --- what we may or may not become in the not-too-distant future.
This DVD, Deus, is the third volume in the series.  The plot has severely thickened, portraying a Lain who is confused because there is a rumor going around that she's been spying on others.  Lain eventually loses her parents, the friendship of Alice (Arisu), and meets with God of the Wired.  This volume is guaranteed to make you ask more questions, if not that, then at least it will force you to watch it over and over again.  Serial Experiments Lain is basically a clever puzzle that happened to be released as an original and stunning anime masterpiece.",987552000,7,1800,4.694267515923567
1054648,5,6305583226,"Lain serial experiment is an awarded anime.  it is fascinating and mysteriously ingenious.  it is very in depth giving confusion and yet offering interest.  any true otaku would know the greatness of Lain.  This DVD is wonderful and is a must see.  you may think Lain is boring and lifeless, but that is the point of her character.  she is weary and drained only thinking of the Wired. gaps of silence are for effect towards those watchimg.  i suggest this anime title to anyone.  watch it twice if it is hard to grasp.  it is wonderful KeyLain",984700800,2,544,4.525773195876289
1054649,5,6305583226,"Many people have expressed confusion over Lain. This is completely understandable, for just as the episodes are named, this is a series with many layers to it. In the beginning, it tricks you into thinking it's something it's not, then confuses you in the middle, and wraps it all up in the end. And that's precisely what we have here: the end.
Lain has been criticized for its animation. The series was underbudgeted and doesn't have the quality of, say, most OVAs and movies, but the style is clean and actually rather nice.
I'll try not to say a whole lot, because here is where you begin to wrap the story up, and it should answer some questions when you watch it. All I can say is that this series really makes you think, and that's not a bad thing, now is it?",972432000,8,765,4.356643356643357
1054650,5,6305583226,"This is the point where a great series reaches its climax, the story can get no better as in this DVD. After this only the conclusion on the fourth disc follows; IMHO this three chapters are the best of all the series, a  hard task to accomplish since all of them are great. Do not doubt it and  enjoy the best anime in years!",954720000,,326,4.078125
1054651,5,6305583226,"The series only gets better as it goes along, and ""Deus"" is no exception. Be forewarned, though, when saying that ""Lain"" gets better, that also means it gets weirder.
I recommend watching each  volume twice. Usually I figure things out after the second viewing.",953164800,2,261,4.931818181818182
1054652,4,6305583226,"This 3rd DVD in the Lain series continues the insanity.  Some of the answers about who Lain is and just what da heck is goin on are revealed finally.  Very satisfying Eps in the haunting, deliberate style that is  Lain.  One to go...",943315200,7,233,4.348837209302325
1054653,5,6305583226,Lain is a new way to look at our lives. Are we really the individuals or parts of an omnipotent supreme being (the universe itself)? May be the WIRED style of life stimulates and makes us evolve... Is Lain different?  These are but a few questions  among hundreds of others in the domain of  Lain series... This is a milestone in anime kingdom. A new bible in  style...,941673600,8,369,4.382352941176471

7892395,4,6305583226,"Lain is great.  All of it.  It's a bit dark, goes in for a few anime tropes, and isn't terribly energetic but it's also quite unique, well-scored, and very atmospheric.  Give it a watch.",1414281600,,186,4.411764705882353

7892399,5,6305583226,"The acid trip that is Lain continues in this third volume, and I'm loving every second of it. The captivating imagery and usage of sound continue to haunt the mind with its masterfully created mood, but as these episodes get down to the nitty-gritty of the series, the plot's got some surprises up its sleeves too. Revelations considering all we've seen are made, highlighting strange details and bringing tons of twists and surprises with it. Those not having paid much attention during earlier episodes will come to regret it now, as these episodes get into what seems to be something that might be heading for Lain's grand finale. Yet, as always with this series, there's absolutely no telling what's going to happen, and all that is yet to be is yet to be seen in the next batch of episodes.

Continuing its haunting imagery and directing, Lain continues to be a stunning product of cinematography, but those who dislike the oft-confusing and occasionally messy storytelling might find something more of their liking in this volume as well, as more distinct sections of the plot start to become clear (And everything else starts to become even vaguer).

5 stars out of me.",1130198400,,1176,4.845771144278607
7892400,1,6305583226,"After 10 episodes, Lain is still left wondering who she is. Is the cyberworld version of herself the real one or is it the human version in the real world? Who are the Borg Brothers that are always tailing her? Are the Knights trying to kill her or help her? Has she been living a lie for all these years at home? Who are her parents and sister really? And just wait till she meets ""God"", the intelligence that runs the Wired! He's just an effeminate man with blue scarves and long hair wrapped around a lab coat. Lain is truly pointless and awful, but luckily there is only one more DVD left in the series. How bad can it get? Another highlight of this volume comes again when she speaks to the ""God"" figure and he's in the form of a silver pulsating blob. How imaginative! Oh, did I forget that interspersed with one episode we bring in the Roswell UFO crash, crackpot earth resonance and humans as neuron theories on top of everything else, with hardly any connection to the show. I was expecting the writers to bring up the Lochness Monster and give Sasquatch a cameo too. What an awful snowballing sludge Lain has transformed into! The character is a callous and uncaring nitwit. For instance, her sister has become a mumbling vegetable, muttering incoherent words, and stumbling against walls and looking maniacal, and Lain's only response is something like ""She sure is acting different!"" Might as well swim in a stagnant pool of mosquito larvae and get more sense of plot advancement and inertia than in the 3 dvds of this series I have watched.",1126915200,,1553,4.56989247311828
7892401,4,6305583226,"Serial Experiment Lain: Vol. 3: Deus contains Layers (episodes) eight through ten.  Deus is the next to last DVD in the Lain anime series.

When I was reading reviews of Lain, another Amazon reviewer commented that the series will ""blow your mind."" At the time, I had only watched the first two volumes of Lain.  I was like, this is interesting, but I guess my mind must be too superior to be ""blown.""  After watching Deus, I may have been wrong.  I am glad I did not watch Deus at night.  I am very thankful I am typing my review while the sun is shining.

Part Matrix, part X-Files, part Boogiepop Phantom, and all post-modernist, Deus suddenly brings up Roswell, the Grays, MJ-12, the Knights Templar, Memex, and Xanadu.  Don't know what they are?  Run these terms through a search engine and see what comes up.  There is a terrifying scene in Deus where Lain is paid an odd visit. I won't spoil it, but don't watch this in the dark!!

In this volume, Lain's life is really turned upside down.  She is questioning ""Who is the real me?""  There seem to be even MORE Lains than the Lain in the Wired, and the Lain in the real world.  There is some kind of horrible leering Lain who scared the crap out of me.

I really like the character of Taro.  He plays a large role in the episodes here. I hope he is in the last disc.

I do have a comment that the classmate's suicide that started this series has completely been swept under the rug.  I hope the girl's death is addressed in the final volume.  Even as fiction, teenage suicide should never be used as just a story-starter.

Extras are woefully meager, with a little concept art, a ""comercial"" for a Lain Playstation game that reveals very little, and of course the episode ""previews"" that are basically Japanese child porn, with closeups of a teen's body parts such as lips, stomach, and - oh, joy, crotch.",1126742400,,1861,4.41764705882353
7892402,5,6305583226,"By this point in the series, the viewer knows that this is not an adventure story about a waif-like girl who falls though a hole into the Internet.  The crisis that builds over the three episodes is Lain's loss of her sense of reality.  This starts as disruptions in her friendships, continues into her family and the fragmentation of her personality.  Confronted, she goes on to challenge a God that cannot be.  In counterpoint to the human story, we are presented a history of the Internet that makes X-files seem totally reasonable,
Beyond any doubt, Lain is about the destructive breakdown of barriers.  Lain's family falls away from her, the suppressed part of her personality acquires a life of its own, her friends mistrust her... nothing is preserved.  The deeper question is what are symptoms and what are causes, and, at the end of ten episodes, we are left with an uneasy feeling that the process is not over.
If I am surprised by the end of the series, it will not be for lack of thinking and guessing.  And that is the true art of 'production 2nd' and director Ryutara Nakamura.  Lain always invites the viewer to look a little deeper, connecting the visual and textual dots to create our own monsters in the same way that The Wired is an intensive abstract for real life.  Trust nothing, we are told.  The truth is nowhere.
Once again, credit has to be given to the artistic staff that takes the plot and gives it its stunning visual and aural presentation.  Emulating what life is like in The Wired believable is no trivial task, and this is so well done that it sets a new standard.  Reflecting it with a reality that is even stranger is far more difficult.",1051747200,,1673,4.577181208053691
7892403,5,6305583226,"If you've seen the previous DVDs in the Serial Experiments Lain series, you know that Lain is an intricate, complex, and breathtaking series. It doesn't go downhill, I can assure you. ""Dues"" is a mindblowing continuation of Lain, and by the end of the DVD, wou'll not only be more drawn in than ever, you'll be eager to see how Lain can possibly finish out in the upcommming final volume",1022198400,,387,4.542857142857143
