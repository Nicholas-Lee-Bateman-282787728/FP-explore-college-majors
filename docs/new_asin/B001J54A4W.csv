8311909,1,B001J54A4W,"This DVD could have been a winner, but unfortunately is not. It is fundamentally an advertisement for the Kayak manufacturers, a fact you do not detect until you are bore to death viewing it. In fishing videos, and in particular fly fishing videos it is important to show the interaction between fish and fisherman, explicitly. Where the fly is cast, how the fisherman activates the fly, how the fish takes the fly (popper or streamer), the motion imparted, the speed of retrieve and of course, the take, the moment of the fish strike. In this video, you see a couple of guys, casting with various degrees of skill, and then fighting the fish. The Kayak fishing content is limited and a bit simplistic. It is unfortunately because the photography is very good, and so are the colors. The DVD is somewhat redeemed by a ten minutes or so sequence on how to properly use a Kayak.
My advice, if you like fly fishing skip this one, is not worth it. If you are beginning to do Kayaking, it might be of some interest to you.",1228176000,,1017,4.5027027027027025
