8599618,2,B001UDPBZA,"Bought this knowing that i was going to take my chances since i have never really heard the community talk about this concert.  Thinking positively putting this in my dvd player, what I got was a sub par quality concert. I will buy usually anything NIN related, but this video is pretty both grainy and pixelated.  I watched it on a standard definition 52"" big screen.  The concert also shows a watermark in the lower right hand corner of the screen the whole time.  I wouldn't mind it if it didn't take up about 1/16 of the screen and the placement of it is in the upper left section of the lower right quadrant of the tv.

The audio quality was average.  Nothing special.  The bad part about this is that it is censored.  Every swear word is removed.  Whoever did the ""cutting"" of this did a bad job at it to boot.  It's a good 1.5 to 2.0 seconds long that is just muted where a swear word is said.

Again, i knew buying this was a gamble.  I would not recommend it at all unless you are a die hard NIN fan, well, don't buy it at all.  Instead go to [...] and pay for the user created concert(s).  THey deserve way more than what they sell their dvd's / blu-rays for.  I hope Trent is making some kind of money on this although if you know his perfectionistic qualities, you know that he had nothing to do with this dvd.",1290729600,5,1322,4.169960474308301
