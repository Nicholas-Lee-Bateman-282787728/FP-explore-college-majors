2303128,3,B0009NZ2S8,Michael Colyar is the only reason why I  bought this and yes he does delivers but the rest no.  Not their finest moments.  I wish I could just find a whole comedy tape of Michael Colyar only,1274400000,,190,4.081081081081081
2303129,4,B0009NZ2S8,"I enjoyed this DVD tremendously, but would be the first to admit that it won't be everybody's cuppa tea. This is more of a comedian's collector's item, so you will either hate it or love it.

If there is one glaringly self-evident truth about this DVD, it is that Michael Colyar is tha bomb! He really affirms himself as the best comedian at delivering a joke. His physical antics are so funny yet he escapes the embarrassment of being slapstick. He also knows how to get a crowd involved without being intrusively interactive. His wit is second to none. His humour is highly intellectual. He always makes a profound point with every performance. I love this guy.

Ricky Harris headlines the show, but he is by far outshone by the other comedians. I have always regarded Ricky as average and he has once again proven me right. Look out for Wil Sylvince- He just blows up on the stage!

He renders a powerfully funny performance that had me in stitches. Retha Jones is also quite good.

The real star of the show is Michael ""King of the road"" Colyar.",1172361600,4,1049,4.534391534391534
