3871610,5,B00283EILE,"I had been doing fertility treatments for 4 years. I bought this video with low expectations, but to my surprise it was very helpful and I got pregnant after 1 month of doing the massage. I had some adhesions (tight scar like tissue in  your muscles or myofacia) and this video teaches you how to properly massage your abdomen so that you can release the adhesions.  I'm not saying the massage is a miracle cure to get pregnant, but I have to say that not only did I find the massage techniques relaxing, I felt the sore spots and adhesions fade away on my abdomen after practicing the massage routinely. I'm going to use this after my baby is born to help get my muscles and uterus back to normal. I highly recommend this video for anybody who has been trying to have a baby and needs to relax and learn how to massage your abdomen. The relaxation alone is beneficial to getting pregnant and you will see results if you have sore spots or adhesions. I honestly felt the sore spots fade away after a month.",1307923200,17,1006,4.374331550802139
3871611,3,B00283EILE,"This DVD is ok.  I think the DVD is not very long in the sense that it only lasts for around 20 minutes (if that!).  The fertility massages, accupressure and how to make castor oil pack is quite good.  But i think because the fertility massage is only for 3 to 5 minutes you may have to repeat the dvd a few times before you grasp the skill for yourself.

I also had to pay a customs charge of 11.65 which i was not made aware of when i purchased this dvd. I also paid the postage and packaging costs of $12 (approx)when i purchased the dvd.  I thought this was very unfair and missleading.  I think the item itself is overpriced for what it is.",1307664000,9,645,4.079365079365079
3871612,5,B00283EILE,"Hethir does an outstanding job of very patiently and clearly and with great heart explaining her program.  This information is by no means only of use to women who are TTC, but to women as a whole to keep the body functioning well and avoid many of the female health issues plaguing younger and younger women.

I would think this would help men as well!

Great product!",1304208000,5,369,4.477611940298507

8355547,5,B00283EILE,This was very helpful after having 2 miscarriages to help me conceive my son within the next cycle.  I would highly recommend this DVD if you are having trouble getting pregnant..  I felt so much better after doing the massage before bed everynight.  I felt more calm and at peace.  The teacher is very informative and goes slow enough you can follow.  She also seems to know what she is doing with her techniques.,1455062400,3,414,4.54054054054054

8355549,4,B00283EILE,"What I like about this DVD massage demonstration is that it is detailed, yet concise and straight to the point. Instructions are clear and easy. I hope this DVD enhances my reproductive health. I just started the massages with the oil packs this week and I will update my review accordingly.",1396483200,2,291,4.7254901960784315
8355550,3,B00283EILE,I bought this to help me because I was having issues becoming pregnant but this didn't help me. Interesting DVD and massages but not my thing.,1382832000,2,142,4.5
8355551,3,B00283EILE,"It's a great DVD but NOT worth $159. It cost $30 everywhere else, don't fall for this. the DVD doesn't cost that much! Seriously!",1381708800,10,129,4.416666666666667

8355554,1,B00283EILE,"I just Hate it, I bought this DVD in March 2012 and followed all the instructions given in this DVD. But it didn't work. i also used Maca powder along these massage techniques.
i don't know why people just try to take advantage of things which might be extremely sensitive issue towards other people.
when i bought it after reading many reviews here on Amazon as well as on different other websites I told my hubby, ""o just bought a product that would make me pregnant in a couple of months"" but no gain. I even didn't notice any change in me after using it.
so i won't recommend it to you because i don't want you to waste your money for this totally crap product.",1340150400,8,665,4.285714285714286
8355555,5,B00283EILE,Using this for hormonal balance and after a week I felt the difference. My body seems to be coming back on track. Loved the anatomical explanation and the castor oil application. An added bonus is that I am getting a full night sleep after I do the massage!!!!! I wasn't expecting that!!! It is great that you can do it to yourself so you don't depend on anyone to get the therapeutic results.,1330387200,8,393,4.397260273972603
8355556,5,B00283EILE,"I have been hoping to become a mother for over a decade. Years ago I had 2 tubal pregnancies on the right side, and that tube was removed. I was told to consider IVF or adoption. I was quite depressed by this, and tried not to think about children. Years went by of unprotected love making with my husband, and no pregnancies. I assumed I was infertile, and IVF is way out of my price range. Well long story short, I found out I have PCOS this year (Jan.), which caused me not to ovulate for all these years. I started Metformin (a medication used for PCOS and insulin resistance) and began to ovulate again, and my cycle came back. Since my diagnosis, my hope to conceive has been restored. I have spent months researching the safest, cheapest, and most effective treatments. I came accross this DVD, and was interested but very skeptical. So many people/companies want to profit from the pain of others infertility without offering real help. I don't usually write reviews, but I HAD to with this. Within the very first cycle I noticed a week of fertile cervical fluid...normally I'd be lucky to have one day. I noticed my very first ovulation pains, and I became PREGNANT! No kidding the very first cycle of using this. Sadly I developed appendicitis early on in my pregnancy, and lost it at 5 weeks.

 As I said I was a skeptic, but if it did only half of what it claims it would be worth 30 bucks. I have since recommended this to everyone I know on TTC (trying to conceive) forums. In the last week and a half I received 2 emails from 2 women who took my advice and tried the massage DVD. Both of them are pregnant after using this for ONE CYCLE, just like me!! One had been trying for about 2 years, but the other is in her 40's and has been trying as long as me!! I am amazed at the results I've seen, not only with me, but the only other 2 women I personally know who have used it. It's unbelievable.
 When I first started the massage, I did it for almost twice as long as they suggested, and was very aggressive (I just wanted results now, and didn't realize how powerful this really is) I was a bit sore (my fault) and I spotted for 2 days. I think that I managed to break up a bit of scar tissue, or perhaps broke up a cyst (common with PCOS) I took a break for a day or two because I overdid it. Then went back to doing it normally and it felt amazing! I had a lot more feeling and sensation in the uterus/ovary/tube area, as I said I felt ovulation for the first time. I haven't done the castor oil packs they recommend, but think I will after I heal from my appendectomy.

 Each day I would run a bubble bath, light candles, put on relaxing music, and I used regular massage oil and massaged while in the tub. I came out each day feeling refreshed and relaxed (more than I expected). After the first day of doing the massage correctly I literally said ""I know this will help get me pregnant"" and it did. I'm so glad I bought this, and can't wait to be healed from surgery to get back to it once again. Even after I have my babies (which I know will happen) I plan to do this massage for mantainance of general reproductive health.

 I can't say enough good things about this DVD, and most of the women I tell about it kind of shrug it off as I initially did. If you are reading this, your curiosity is peaked. Isn't it worth 30 bucks to try? Think of the thousands women spend on toxic medications...I thought I was the most hopeless case ever, and it has changed my reproductive health. Do yourself a favor and give in to your curiousity, hopefully you will thank me when you too get your BFP. If I could give this 6 or 7 stars I would. As I said I am skeptical, especially when they claim to help every aspect of fertility, but this TRULY works. Again I don't usually give reviews, but I want to spread the word of this amazing healing natural treatment to my fellow sisters struggling with infertility. (would be great for pelvic pain as well)TRY THIS DVD!!! Baby Dust!!

P.S. No I'm not a paid spokeswoman for the company, lol. I've had questions and things both related to the massage, and totally unrelated that I e-mailed to the women who run this company (they consist of naturopaths, a doula, and a massage therapist/naturopath. They do offer a full fertility consultation where they get your history and recommend products/treatments for I think 60 bucks. I didn't do that, and they still very kindly and promptly answered all my questions. Oh, and don't do the freebie videos on youtube. They are crap and totally different.",1313452800,25,4550,4.338425381903643
