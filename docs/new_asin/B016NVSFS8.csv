I actually felt like this was a fairly well-done movie.  It starts exactly where the first film left off.  Riley, the main character, had sex with Samantha in the previous film...after she'd contracted the virus.

This movie deals with the repercussions, which is interesting.  You get to see how the virus effects a male vs. a female.  This movie also goes into a great deal of detail as to WHY this is all happening, which I was thankful for.  The first movie left many unanswered questions.  Actually, this one does too...there is obviously going to be a third installment to this franchise. I'll definitely be watching!",1507593600,3,634,4.805555555555555
