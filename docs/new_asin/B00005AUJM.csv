1418553,5,B00005AUJM,"This is a film that is not to be view lightly.  It's on the serious side, and plays on your emotion and mind.  This is a master piece and movies like these are rare nowadays.  The film also offers a lighter side of the spectrum with a bit of humor and lovely standard Jazz tunes.  It has an interesting twist at the end.
This is definitely a film for mature audiences who can appreciate the complex human nature and emotions and the fragile of human minds.  The film is full of intellectual conversations over and over again and if you are not paying attention you can miss out on the lines.  Mia Farrow is the best looking of the bunch no doubt and is the lead character.  However, as the film progress, I must give the notch to Dianne Wiest for best performance in this movie.  Hats off to you Dianne if you are reading this review.  Her sets with Sam Waterston are so real that make you forget it's only a movie.  Her performance in the set when Sam reach over to kiss her one last time to say good bye will pierce open your heart as she rejects and look away.  I often wonder how is it possible to act like this when you know fully well there are cameras and a room full of crews watching.
One minor point though as I find some of Denholm Elliott's dialogues not recorded very clearly.  Denholm is a wonderful actor and his lines are beautiful.  This is also true for all the actors and actresses in this movie, all performed superb.  This DVD is definitely a keeper for years to come.",1081641600,5,1489,4.252669039145908
1418554,5,B00005AUJM,"September is a display of Woody Allen's influence by the Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman.  This is an psychoanalytical examination of characters who are constrained to the home of Lane (Mia Farrow) on the Vermont countryside.  Through the eyes of Allen, one can scrutinize a wide array of actions taken by the characters that are personified from their self-interests, insecurities and fears.  These actions lead to a cyclical pattern of the characters' behaviors that are built on their own view of self.  At the end, September will leave with a taste of bitterness due to its self-reflective influence.",1027987200,,605,5.206185567010309
1418555,2,B00005AUJM,"1st things 1st...I love Woody's films and consider myself a true fan but after several re writes, scraping almost the entire film, re casting almost every role I found this film completly boring and just too claustrophobic...",1009670400,3,225,5.108108108108108
1418556,2,B00005AUJM,"I am the happy owner of ALL Woody Allen's films on DVD that are currently available.  I am also a fan of his dramatic work, particularly the under-rated and underappreciated ""Interiors"" and ""Another Woman.""
""September"" is not only one of the worst of his career, but one of the worst films I've ever endured.  It is rather BEAUTIFULLY ACTED, with some CLEVER LINES interspersed (hence the two stars I granted it), but it's mostly MELODRAMATIC SLOP.  And that CLAUSTROPHOBIC feel you may have read about previously:  Absolutely true!  Despite constant references to how ""beautiful"" the scenery is, the blinds are always closed day and night (this is because the film was shot entirely on a soundstage with no artifical backdrops).
I wanted to write this to warn other Woody Allen fans who may wish to experiment -- DO YOURSELF A FAVOR: NOT WITH THIS ONE!
 ... inexplicably, ""September"" (and the equally inept ""Shadows and Fog"") was released on DVD prior to ""Hannah and her Sisters"" and ""Husbands and Wives,"" two masterpieces in my opinion.",996796800,5,1038,4.936781609195402
1418557,5,B00005AUJM,"Probably not everyone would agree with me on this, but I think this is one of Woody Allen's top 5 movies, and pretty close to the top 1 or 2.  It is just as good as ""Another Woman"" (which is often considered his ""best"" drama) and all of the performances are captivating throughout the film.  The pacing of ""September"" is excellent-83 minutes is the perfect length for the story, and it is not overly drawn out nor does it move too quickly.  If you don't know this film, be warned that it is not a comedy, but a drama-on par with Bergman-although Elaine Stritch does have some pretty funny lines...This is definitely one to check out (and since the DVD is so reasonably priced, you should just buy it).  By the way, the DVD transfer is much cleaner than any VHS copy I have seen, so the cinematography can be appreciated even more.",994982400,6,830,4.405228758169935
1418558,4,B00005AUJM,"Woody Allen's 1987 drama was made in the middle of his Mia period and in spite of it's wet anguish, it's interesting to see what Farrow brought to his films, what he did for her and why his post-Mia films suffer without her. The role of the suicidal mousy hostess of the Vermont house where the film is set is clearly wrong for Diane Keaton, and Farrow's real life situation feeds the character - her love of the country, her showbiz mom. Pauline Kael has described her as ""luminously thin-skinned"" and ""weightlessly beautiful with a preternatural glowing sweetness"". Her emotional openness and the way she uses her hands demonstrate a delicacy that makes her Lane very moving. When she cries she gives Allen her all. The film recalls Allen's earlier Interiors but is better written. Allen has scaled down the cast to six, though Jack Warden and Denholm Elliott only hover, and reduced the plot to a series of intimate conversations with one or two group scenes. Being Allen he can't help but throw in jokes. I like how Farrow calls her mother played by Elaine Stritch a ""human dynamo"" and Stritch in return tells Farrow she dresses like a ""Polish refugee"", and a blackout scene gets laughs when someone declares their ""hand is in the gaucomole"". He has the rooms of the house full of closed shutters to keep nature out and to conceal the fact that he has shot on a soundstage. He also continues his experiments with framing by having a character talk to someone out of shot, and gives the actors plenty of room to move. Stritch has a wonderful monologue to a mirror and Dianne Wiest acts one decision about the droopy Sam Waterston with her back. Allen had cast Sam Shepard in the Waterstone role but then fired him when he began improvising about the West. Wiest may overdo the hand to the forehead gesture but she works well with Farrow. Interiors was a radical change of pace after Annie Hall and Woody's comedy fans hated it, a situation he used for Stardust Memories. September is in the same Bergman-ish vein and, since I love Bergman and found Interiors very funny, I don't find this film such a chore.",988070400,7,2110,4.629333333333333

1418572,5,B00005AUJM,"Woody Allen movies have always been intelligent, articulate, thought provoking and well directed. September is no exception as it constitutes one of the maestro's finest efforts. Full of drama and comedic elements the film is infused with poignancy and features commendable performances from Mia Farrow and the supporting casts. Highly recommended.

The story revolves around the main character, aptly portrayed and acted by Mia Farrow - who demonstrates her skill as an actress in a commendable performance (for that matter all Woody Allen movies featuring Mia Farrow demonstrates her excellent skills as an actress), attempting to piece together her life following a nervous breakdown and a separation from her husband. Although she is still in love with her husband and harbours hopes of rekindling her relationship with him, he has his sight on another person, while her close friends continually arranges to manipulate her into developing a relationship with a fledging writer. This creates a love triangle of unrequited love between the writer and her and unrequited feelings between her and her husband.

In the meantime, the writer has based a novel on her mother's past which she feels exploits her family's past, while her mother is flattered by the writer who feels that her mother's life is interesting enough to put on the printed page, and somewhere along the line the sordid truth about her mother murdering her father and, hence, causing her to suffer a nervous breakdown is revealed, amidst an attempt by her to sell the house to cover her medical expenses and so as to move to a new apartment amidst strong protest from her mother.

All this makes for an engrossing and captivating dramatic essay captured impeccably by the maestro and must surely constitute one of his finest efforts.",1397174400,,1803,5.125850340136054
1418573,5,B00005AUJM,"I have not seen Uncle Vanya so cannot comment about whether this film is its mirror or not. I can say thought that this is based upon a true event which happened in HOLLYWOOD in 1958. This was Johnny Stompanato's murder while alone in the company of actress Lana Turner and her daughter. The brilliant difference which occurs here though is that this drama occurs years later with the mother now an older woman and remarried, her daughter single and without any purpose in life, and a house full of guests in their Vermont country home. There are other characters with their own problems but nothing on the level of this mother and daughter. Only gradually does it occur to the other guests, including the mother's new husband, that they have unwittingly stumbled upon a landscape mined with emotional devastation. Sam Waterston and Diane Wiest have a passing forbidden romance, as he has been Farrow's romance for the summer. But the two of them were almost comic relief by the end.  This is my second time seeing this.  I really preferred seeing the action take place so many years later with all of the wreckage intact that the Johnny Stompanato murder was bound to cause. I was always fascinated by the case and was so glad to see it offered from an entirely new and unexpected slant.

SPOILER

In 1958 Lana Turner, a big movie star at the time, had a gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato.  He worked for Mickey Cohen, who was the big gangster in Los Angeles. The two lovers had a tumultuous relationship with loud fights, Lana getting beaten up, a lot of drinking, etc., Lana, Johnny and Lana's daughter, a minor, Cheryl Crane, were all alone in the house together on an April night when Johnny Stompanato was stabbed to death. Cheryl Crane took the blame, saying he was beating on her mother and she came to her mother's defense. If Lana had killed him, chances are she would have spent a lot of time in jail for murder or manslaughter.  Cheryl, being a minor, would either get off or get a comparatively light sentence in a juvenile facility.  This is exactly what happened.  The jury found Cheryl Crane had committed justifiable homicide but she was made a ward of the state and sent away to boarding school (presumably to be a better environment than under the roof of a movie star with such poor choices in men).  Lana Turner was supposed to have put on the best performance of her life while on the witness stand at Cheryl's trial as to Cheryl's saving her life from Stompanato.  Neither of them ever recanted this story but it has always been suspected that Lana was the one who killed him.  For one, it is hard to picture a 14 year old girl taking out a 32 year old gangster, mob enforcer, US Marine with a knife. This is the exact story that the mother and daughter, played by Elaine Stritch and Mia Farrow, are tortured by in SEPTEMBER except they change the knife to a gun. They do a superb job.  Woody Allen makes it pretty clear by movie's end that it was the mother who killed the boyfriend, not the daughter, and that she has ruined her daughter's life irreparably. Ironically, the real Cheryl Crane did better.  She became a successful real estate agent in Los Angeles with her long time lesbian partner.

1418574,4,B00005AUJM,"This small ensemble film centers on Lane (played by Mia Farrow) who has returned to her childhood Vermont home to try and figure out what she wants out of her life. She soon falls in love with writer, Peter (Sam Waterston) who doesn't always seem to return Lane's affections; but becomes smitten with Lane's friend, Stephanie (Dianne Wiest), who is visiting for a week or two. It would be better if Lane had interest in next-door neighbor Howard (Denholm Elliott), who obviously pines for her. But then enters Elaine Stritch as Lane's mother Diane, a famous movie actress who's star has faded, and is intent on getting Peter to write her biography. Stritch is in rare form as Lane's mother, giving the movie a large dose of hilarity that it needs. She gets upstaged, however, when Lane trumps her on the elements of a story from their past.

This isn't one of Woody Allen's best films, but it is definitely entertaining and well-made.",1356134400,2,934,4.730061349693251
1418575,5,B00005AUJM,"Great movie. Mia's acting so amazing--interesting, for instance, when seen in contrast to her role in ""Broadway Danny Rose."" Amazing to see her, in ""September,"" both act and LOOK so mousy. This beautiful woman transformed by her own talent.

And Dianne Wiest. What a marvel of fantastic acting, and what a great face--those squinchy eyes that end up, on her, being beautiful. And Elaine Stritch, whom I'd never seen before. And all the men, too. Wonderful.

And the quiet of the movie, the space between things--very pleasurable.

Perhaps my favorite part: the house itself.

A real gem of a movie.",1343260800,2,598,4.95
1418576,5,B00005AUJM,"This is by far one of Woody Allen's best films. My favorite film of his is Manhattan. But September really comes close. September is a very understated but beautiful, integrated film that fits together like a great painting. It is a subtle work of art, that is so immensely satisfying due to its quiet excellence. Yet it is so frustrating that mainstream ""professional"" critics dismiss movies like this. It just goes to show that you shouldn't trust journalists too much, which is why I give more credence to the insights of Amazon volunteer reviewers. The fact that the critics pan this masterpiece is absolute proof that you should not trust so-called ""professional"" critics. But it really amazes me that they don't get it.",1239926400,6,725,4.902439024390244
1418577,4,B00005AUJM,"If you were to define the term `passion project' you might want to use a film like `September'.  Woody Allen was so `passionate' about this film that he shot it more than once, rewrote it during the shoot, recast the film multiple times, tore it apart after editing and was keen on doing it all over again.  The finished piece we are left with is cohesive and genuine and `hopefully' what Allen was looking for.

I should say this first off; this is unlike your usual Allen fare so be forewarned.  It is much more personal and intimate and draws comparisons to Bergman's work (who apparently is a big influential director for Allen).  It feels so far removed from Allen's work that I would have never known it really was part of his filmography had I not looked it up.

Just thought you should know that.

The film takes place in one large home over a weekend while a middle-aged woman deals with her love interest in he neighbor as well as her distanced relationship with her attention hungry mother.  I think the description for the film I read simply stated `Howard is in love with Lane but Lane is in love with Peter but Peter is in love with Stephanie' but it is so much more than that.  The film reflects the quiet emotional balance between characters, allowing the house itself to almost take over in scenes as the characters converse in stilted whispers.  Occasional outbursts of disgruntled chaos add layers of emotional relevancy to the otherwise docile proceedings.  It's a very small, very quiet, very simple film, but it's within the simplicity that it excels.

The acting is all spot on, especially from the women.  Mia Farrow (Allen's muse at the time) really captured her characters quiet desperation, allowing just enough of her uneasy nature to brim to her surface.  Elaine Stritch is hilarious as Lane's intrusive mother Diane.  The way she handles her characters self absorption is incredible.  She's biting throughout.  Dianne Wiest, a favorite of mine, continues to prove why she is seriously one of the best supporting actresses of all time.  She flows effortlessly through this film, creating a character we want to know more of.  The men here are fine bedfellows, but they cannot match the intrigue provided by their female counterparts.

My only complaint with the film is the script, which I felt was a little unfinished.  I wasn't very interested in the subplot concerning Diane and her ex-boyfriend's murder or whatever.  I know it was partially based on fact and it does offer us a segway into more meaty matters between mother and daughter, but I found that it felt rather forced, and that was a shame because the film otherwise feels very relaxed and genuine.

I still highly recommend this one though, for it is a different side of Woody and it serves as a nice character study; a true testament to relationships and self acceptance.",1235520000,2,2866,4.745454545454545
1418578,3,B00005AUJM,"Woody Allen made September after Radio Days, with its huge ensemble cast. After orchestrating that circus, he wanted to do a piece of chamber music. It is a serious drama with hardly any jokes. No jokes whatsoever. It is similar to Interiors, kind of a Chekhov play, or else maybe like something Ingmar Bergman would do. Interestingly, Woody shot the whole film with one cast, didn't like it, and did the whole thing over again with a mostly different cast. So, even though it was a much cheaper film to make with fewer characters and all of the action taking place in one location, a house in Vermont, it cost twice as much as it should have.

It must have meant a lot to Woody Allen to make this film, but the results are flat. Dianne Wiest, Jack Warden, Elaine Strich, Denholm Elliott, and the rest give good performances, but we are left with a depressing movie where nothing much happens. The score, plenty of jazz standards like Slow Boat to China played on piano, some even featuring Ben Webster on tenor sax and Art Tatum on piano, are nice, but you'd be better off just playing their records.

The background information about the characters is doled out sparingly, with a few bombshells dropped here and there. There is an amusing scene where Mia is trying to sell her house, and a Real Estate Agent brings some prospective buyers through. Jack Warden's character is a physicist who has some interesting things to say about the randomness of sub atomic particles, but his insights, like September, go nowhere.

1418581,5,B00005AUJM,"I have only one quibble with this wonderful movie.  Sam Waterston (Peter) did I thought a very poor job.  It wasn't until his last moments in the movie that I realized he was on the level.  I thought he was a phony, leading the two women on, out for a roll in the hay and didn't care what he had to say to get it.  I was wrong.  This spoiled the movie for me.  But surmounting that, I loved every emotional moment in it.  I thought it was beautiful. And I thought everyone but Waterston was wonderful.  I really liked the love between Mia Farrow's parents, they fit, they were happy.  And I think Dianne Wiest is some kind of a sorceress.  How many people is she?  I saw her in Allen's Bullets and was enchanted.  And now this.  A totally different type, different person.  And brother can she act.  I love this movie and I think the nasty Amazon staff review is dead wrong.  Allen the wit truly has a gift for drama.  The dialogue rang true and was literate (though not literary), I love Allen's taste in music, the characters were clearly defined and lifelike.  One note.  I've seen all Allen's movies except ""Celebrity"" which is next on my list.  There is a common character in them.  And that's the artist (in this case Mia Farrow and her photography) who feels like a failure and doesn't know what to do with his life.  I thought it was a great flick.",1167782400,4,1356,4.2976190476190474
1418582,3,B00005AUJM,"Made by Woody Allen in his serious mode, the drama ""September"" is not as impressive and fine as ""Another Woman"" but it is still an interesting movie. Chekhov said once about the characters in his plays, ""People sit at the table, drink tea, talk politics, and at the same time their hearts get broken"". In this regard, Allen's ""September' is a very Chekhovian movie (""Uncle Vanya"" comes to mind first). The film takes place inside a country house in Vermont where several characters, friends and relatives of Lane (Mia Farrow), a fragile and troubled young woman recovering from a nervous breakdown, get together for a rainy weekend in the end of the Summer. The weekend will be filled with the drinks, conversations, tender and delicate music. Six characters will fell in and out of love; the friendships will be betrayed, the hearts will be broken, a hidden family secret will come out. Along with the characters, we will reflect on love, mother-daughter complicated relationship, family secrets, aging, loneliness, longing, emotional crises, and self doubt as six cultured and intelligent individuals will try to find the meaning and the purpose in their lives. The film brings to mind John Cheever's observation: ""The main emotion of the adult American who has had all the advantages of wealth, education, and culture is disappointment."" There are a lot of disappointments, regrets and unhappiness in the characters of ""September"" but the weekend will be over, the rain will stop. There will be the possibility of hope in the future.

1418583,4,B00005AUJM,"`September', written and directed but not starring Woody Allen is, what he describes as a `chamber piece' done after the symphony of `Radio Days' with its huge cast and expansive settings. In most ways, the movie is a reprise of the style of his very first serious movie, `Interiors'. In many ways, `September' is far more successful than `Interiors'. I am an ardent Woody Allen fan, and `Interiors' even leaves me feeling a bit flat.

Like `Interiors' and unlike some of his major seriocomic movies such as `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `September' has not a single joke and just the barest of embarrassingly humorous situation. Unlike `Interiors', you can identify several of Allen's favorite subjects; the most prominent one being the difference between perception and reality or, as he most commonly frames it, between fact and fiction.

All action takes place in late August (`almost September') inside or on the porch of a rather large rural house in Vermont, set by a pond, and built by the principle character's father. The background information on the six marquee characters is spotty, with tidbits being parceled out slowly over the course of the short movie. The facts about the major players follows.

Lane, played by Mia Farrow, is a damaged young photographer who has been out of work due to an undisclosed medical problem, probably psychiatric. She is depicted as the purported owner of the house, which she is planning to sell to pay off her medical expenses and get a new start in New York City.

Peter, played by Sam Waterston (replacing Sam Shephard in a reshoot of the entire film), is a Madison Avenue advertising (copy writer or editor?) who is spending some time over a Summer vacation in Vermont to finish a first novel. As the movie opens, he is seen as Lane's boyfriend.

Stephanie, played by Dianne Wiest, is a close friend to Lane. Stephanie is married with a family living in Philadelphia, but is taking time away from her husband to resolve some emotional differences. She is considering a trip to Paris as the movie opens.

Howard, played by Denholm Elliott (replacing Charles Durning in the reshoot), is a local French teacher who is a good local friend to Lane and her family.

Diane, played by Elaine Stritch (replacing Maureen O'Sullivan in the reshoot), is Lane's mother by Diane's first husband, who she left for a second man who abused Diane. The story as the movie opens establishes that Lane shot and killed Diane's second husband when Lane was but 14 years old. In what seems like a throwaway `Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolff' moment, it is revealed that Diane actually shot her husband and the story cooked up for the police and the trial was that the shooting was done by the underage Lane.

Lloyd, played by Jack Warden, is Diane's current (third?) husband who happens to be a theoretical physicist. His speciality is not spelled out, but since he did do some work at Los Alamos, it can be assumed that he worked in quantum physics. This is a bit more than nominally interesting, as a theme running through the dialogue is the notion that, like events at the quantum level, everything is random.

The heart of the story is how Lane, fragile at best at the opening of the movie, is brought even lower by two quick blows to her fragile psyche. The first is her mother's deciding to live in the Vermont house permenantly, countering Lane's plans to sell the house to financially recover. The second of the two blows is when Lane discovers that boyfriend Peter is romantically entangled with married friend Stephanie.

The theme of fiction versus reality arises in the suggestion Diane makes to Peter that he writes Diane's memoirs. It is not entirely clear to what Diane owes her celebrity, but a couple touring the house with an interest in making an offer to purchase recognizes Diane's photograph as a person of celebrity with major contacts with Broadway and Las Vegas performers. The theme peaks with the allegation that it was Diane, not Lane who killed her second husband.

Another theme is life after death, brought out by Diane's playing with an old Ouija board trying to contact past husbands, versus current husband's very scientific view of the randomness of nature.

The one area where Allen outdoes practically all other films is that in place of a romantic triangle, Allen creates a romantic square with both Lane and Stephanie paired up with both Peter and Howard at different points in the movie.

This is probably one of Allen's most literate and circumscribed movies. Even with the few characters and the very small set, there are still a lot of loose ends. The whole story could probably be told in a `New Yorker' short story, of which Allen wrote many early in his career.

As the action is relatively easy to follow and the resolutions end on a fairly positive note, this is a much less depressing film than `Interiors'. It is also artistically superior, but not up to the level of his very best films.

A `must see' for any Allen fan. People who just like his comedies can take a pass.",1117670400,18,5046,4.770642201834862
1418584,4,B00005AUJM,"Allen's September (1987) suffered from highly dismissive reviews which remains consistent with the public's view that Allen should produce comedies. Allen's willingness to risk, whether he fails or not, should be a clear invitation to consider this piece if just for the purpose of contrasting his present work with earlier films that defined him as a professional funny man.

The discerning viewer might enjoy this character study about six people if he or she wants a piece that demands a bit more reflection. As other reviewers wisely point out, Allen borrows from Chekhov, particularly Uncle Vanya, in September and shows us how selfishness and thoughtlessness have their repercussions on innocent bystanders.

But the plot unfolds carefully as Lane (Mia Farrow) struggles to deal with unrequited love for a struggling writer (Sam Waterston)and an unwelcome guest in her mother (Elaine Stritch). I tend to favor the scenes which take place in candlelight. Lane's best friend, Stephanie, (Dianne Wiest) plays the piano as various characters reveal their fears and desires in carefully constructed monologues and dialogues. We learn a great deal about how professional concerns do not always eclipse the existential questions people face or the reality that people can go on living while harboring painful regrets.

Eventually, a particular truth surfaces which sends the characters reeling but Allen gives us a reprieve by offering an ending that is fair albeit unnerving.

Allen fans who enjoy his comdies should switch gears to view this film. Like his more sober films, September offers viewers the pleasure of character development as the fuel which moves the film forward.",1114387200,5,1680,5.3522727272727275
1418585,5,B00005AUJM,"This is Woody Allen's wonderful Chekhovian drama about love: unrequited, found, and finally lost. Mia Farrow is a somewhat surpressed artist who is in love with neighbor Sam Waterston. She disillusions herself, however, because Waterston is actually in love with Farrow's sister, Diane Wiest, who is married to the boring Denholm Elliott. When Wiest catches Farrow and Waterston in an embrace, she is shocked and explodes, mainly at her mother (Elaine Stritch) - a whole other surpressed matter. This is a marvelous piece of movie making: tightly acted, intelligent, and poignant. Critics bashed it when it first came out, but I think they got it wrong. This is top-notch Woody Allen; I'd even go so far to say it's one of his best pictures.",1111881600,6,741,4.983870967741935
1418586,3,B00005AUJM,"Time has been kind to Woody Allen's 'September,' his second dramatic film, which met with pronounced critical and popular apathy upon its initial release in 1987.

At the time, Allen was riding a resurgence of popularity following 'Hannah & Her Sisters' (1986) and 'Radio Days' (1987), two largely optimistic comedies that regained for the director a portion of the audience he had lost after a series of idiosyncratic early 1980s projects, including the brilliant but commercially unsuccessful 'Stardust Memories' (1980), the underrated 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy' (1982), 'Zelig' (1983), 'Broadway Danny Rose' (1984), and 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' (1985).

Upon release, 'September' seemed remarkably crimped, reductive, and sterile in a manner in which his earlier dramatic effort, 'Interiors' (1978), had not; and for the first time, Allen's self-cannibalization of earlier themes, plots, and jokes was blatantly apparent. Personal betrayal, a longstanding Allen theme, and one which was soon to dominate his own private and public life, was a dominant story element, as were frustrated WASPS belatedly angling after careers in the arts and anxious characters obsessed with the amoral nature of the universe.

If 'September' was the weakest film Allen had then created up to that point, the decades since have seen the director create many more of a far weaker caliber.

The Nineties would see his projects become so unpopular that few were given national release, a trend which continues into the present, despite Allen's millennial alliance with Dreamworks. While lacking the cohesive strength of a later-era Allen classic like 'Bullets Over Broadway' (1994), today 'September' views much more powerfully than the fragmented, mediocre 'Crimes And Misdemeanors' (1989), which, like 'September,' was dissembled and rebuilt from the ground up after initially being found unsatisfactory. 'September' was filmed either two or three times with revolving casts; actors cast in earlier versions include Christopher Walken, Sam Shepard, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Charles Durning.

In many ways, 'September,' which takes place in an off-camera Vermont, is a dark mirror reflection of 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy,' the earlier Allen project also set in a bucolic landscape.

Like that film, 'September' also revolves around six characters, most of whom are suffering the vicissitudes of unrequited love, though the median age here has shifted towards the middle age and late maturity. Like the earlier film, one character playfully believes that the spirit world is accessible and attempts contact with the dead (in fact, what appears to be the circular ""spirit ball"" from the 1982 film is clearly visible on a bookshelf in 'September,' but turns out to be a copper ice chest).

As in 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy,' past violations of morality motivate the behavior of the characters in the present, and the threat of suicide hovers in the air. While the earlier film is appropriately set at ""midsummer,"" 'September' oddly takes place, not in September, but in late summer--the last week of August.

One of the film's obvious weaknesses is its trite and awkward dialogue; it is to the cast's credit that all of the actors, especially Dianne Wiest, who receives the lion's share of unutterable lines, deliver even the film's most stilted dialogue with an absolute minimum of self-consciousness. Depressive wallflower Lane's (Mia Farrow) physical appearance (braided hair, oversized granny glasses, dowdy clothing) has clearly been modeled on Ingmar Bergman's Eva (Liv Ullman) from Ingmar Bergman's 'Autumn Sonata' (1978), another drama about a cathartic, but potentially destructive, visit from an overpowering, highly successful mother.

Upon release, most of the received critical attention focused negatively on the script's reliance on a scandalous tragedy from a classic era of Hollywood history for its denouement (the Cheryl Crane/Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato murder case of 1958); today, however, it is easy to appreciate how well this episode is integrated into 'September' and how little the film as a whole relies upon it as a device. In fact, Allen's script does a remarkable job of extrapolating the complex nuances of actual guilt and passive aggressive accusation in the pivotal confrontation scene.

Elaine Stritch gives an incredible and apparently effortless performance throughout 'September,' but her work in the climactic scene may be one of the most perfect, if brief, examples of understated film acting ever recorded. As the blowsy, extroverted, and tactless Diane, Stritch beautifully combines the two mothers of Allen's 'Interiors'--the first destructive, idealistic, and imperious, and the second vital but ""vulgar""--into one highly believable, multifaceted character who projects a shadow across the screen.

'September,' which is scripted like a four-act play and was originally scheduled to be filmed in Farrow's Connecticut home, was shot completely on a studio set; though rain, thunder, croaking frogs, and crickets are heard intermittently, the Vermont landscape is never glimpsed, another factor which initially seemed to detract from the film. But today, especially when considering Allen's hilariously banal use of autumn foliage in his next project, 'Another Women' (1988), the decision seems admirable.

Like 'A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy,' 'September' is a very small near-masterpiece worthy of serious reevaluation by critics and the public alike.",1106006400,5,5496,5.568862275449102
1418587,4,B00005AUJM,"""September"" is Woody Allen's updated version of the Chekhov play ""Uncle Vanya"". It is not ""like"" ""Uncle Vanya"", or as great as ""Uncle Vanya"". It is ""Uncle Vanya"". The sex of some of the characters has been changed and the dialog has been updated (Art Tatum had yet to be born when Chekhov wrote ""Uncle Vanya""), but the movie is as true to Chekov's play as, for example, the movie ""O"" is to Shakespeare's ""Othello"".

Those of you who have criticized ""September""  as boring, including Amazon's own reviewer, Richard T. Jameson, who called it, '...the single most excruciating viewing experience the Woodman ever invited audiences to share..."" need to see or read Chekov's masterpieces, The ""Cherry Orchard"", ""Three Sisters"", ""The Seagull"" and-most especially-""Uncle Vanya"", in order that you may make your observations from a more informed perspective. Chekov was once criticized as the ""..master of the play in which nothing happens..."" Unfortunately, Amazon lists no VHS or DVD versions of Uncle Vanya, so you will have to wait to see Vanya performed at a college near you or sit down under a good lamp and read.

The fact that Woody Allen has never dumbed down his writing to the level of most of the movie-going public has been a two edged sword and it has cut him both ways. One only has to read the reviews here on Amazon to understand why. Is anyone curious as to why the reviews of this movie are so polarized? This is either Woody's most boring movie ever, or the reviewer's favorite Woody movie-almost nothing in the middle. I hope he gets a good laugh over that if he bothers to read such things.

I have looked all over the internet to find a reference to Woody's source for the movie and have not found it mentioned. Roger Ebert praised the movie saying, ""... In the neat pairings of couples and non-couples, Allen almost seems to be making a modern-dress Elizabethan comedy..."" and that ""... he is as acute an author of serious dialogue as anyone now making movies...""

1418588,5,B00005AUJM,"Richard T. Jameson, who has the dubious distinction of writing the ""official"" editorial statement about this Allen masterpiece, does not know what he is talking about. As often happens here on Amazon, many of the customer reviews are far more knowledgeable and discerning that the conventional mainstream critic's assessments.
This is a finely written, highly dramatic play transfered flawlessly to film by a master cinematographer and is immensely superior to ""Interiors"" which is heavily influenced by, if not actually ripped off from, Ingmar Bergman. Here, the influence is subsumed into Allen's style and milieu, and he gets tremendous performances from the cast, especially Mia Farrow who despite the later troubles with Allen gave him a heartbreaking rendition of the fragile, wounded character of ""Lane"" who is brought to a state of desperation in the climax of the story, which is a spellbinding example of pure dramatic storytelling.",1088640000,21,942,5.414965986394558

Hot Toasty Rag, September 18, 2017

Mia Farrow, Dianne Wiest, Sam Waterston, Elaine Stritch, Denholm Elliott, and Jack Warden make up the cast of Woody Allens dramatic film September. If youve only seen Woody Allens comedies, youll be very surprised by how heavy he can get.

Elaine Stritch plays Mia and Diannes mother, and they make up a typically dysfunctional family, with lots of secrets, resentments, betrayals, and unfortunate love that binds them all together. Mia falls in love with Sam, but Sam becomes infatuated with her sister instead, adding more tension to the mix. The acting in this movie is pretty incredible, but, as is sometimes the case with heavy dramas, it can be tough to watch. This probably won't end up being your favorite movie, but at the very least youll be able to appreciate the performances. If you're a fan of any of the actors, add this one to your list.",1505692800,,909,4.7834394904458595
