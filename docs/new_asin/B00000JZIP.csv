8119831,5,B00000JZIP,"Rayearth is a fantastic series about three school girls, Hikari (Shining), Umi (Ocean), and Fuu (Windstorm).  The girls continue on in their quest and gain irreplacable friends who aid them in the war to save Cephiro.  The girls gain new abilities this time around.  They also have new and different insights on their quest.  This is another great disc for character development.  They realize that they must all become full Magic Knights before the final battle which draws near.
This is the fourth disc of the memorial box being sold individually.  It contains episodes thirteen through sixteen .  In all honestly, buy the boxed set.  It will save you more money.
Magic Knight Rayearth is a fantastic series which has two seasons out, and a rumored third one in the making.  The art, characters, plot, and music are unforgettable.  I highly suggest it.",990057600,,854,4.909090909090909
8119832,5,B00000JZIP,"This is probably tied with Tape 5 as my favorite tape of the first MKR season. (I haven't seen nor read MKR2 yet.) The first episode features two of my favorites, Fuu-chan and the fabulous dancer/illusionist with the  Southern/Osaka accent (depending on if you're watching the dub or sub),  Caldina. The dub of this is very good IMHO, they still mess up some of the  names but with the exception of Inouva I think all the voices are great.  (Hikaru's is actually more bearable in English, IMHO..I don't like her  seiyuu. ^_^;) Still, this is a great tape in English or Japanese, and it  starts the series on a more serious tone while still maintaining humorous  moments. (And Fuu and Ferio fans, GET THIS TAPE. It contains one of the  best Ferio episodes ^ ^.)",956448000,,760,4.5777777777777775
8119833,5,B00000JZIP,"This Magic Knight Rayearth movie is about the girls, Hikaru,Umi and Fuu looking for the next Rune-God, and comes back Caldina trying to kill the Magic Knights for Zagato only for the money. Ascot is trying to stop  Caldina, and will try to stop her for his newest friends lifes.",954633600,,278,4.56
8119834,5,B00000JZIP,"I have all the Magic Knight video's out, so far, and this one had one of my favorite episodes.  Episode 15, I think, involved Ferio returning for another appearance *He's so cute!*, and there's a lot of cute and romantic  turmoil between him and Fuu when Ferio's seen with another woman. *Oh no!*  And, also in that episode, the coolest villian of the series, Innova  <3, comes in.  He is an awesome character for an evil guy, and the mere  fact that he's so cruel in the episode makes him even cooler.  The Episode  before it, though, was rather bizarre, because it wasn't needed and merely  showed Hikaru bleeding alot.  Not that it matters, though, because the  video was still great and I recommend it to any MKR fan!  *Fuu rocks!*",947289600,,735,4.526717557251908
