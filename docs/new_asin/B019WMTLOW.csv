7583768,2,B019WMTLOW,To many box jumps.  Using a 10 in riser for box jumps is dangerous.  Boring intervals. The worst of the series and I could care less what they are wearing. I get tired of no complicated choreography excuse for higher jumps.  When was Cathe ever using 10 in box jumps.  The original bootcamp is better.  It is far more effective and doable. I love that one.  This one is a loser.,1456790400,4,378,4.253521126760563

7583770,5,B019WMTLOW,"Workout time: 44:41 minutes
Equipment:  5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, step (2-3 risers), mat and stability ball.
Muscle Meltdown: Biceps
Outfits: Dark coral tops with medium blue bottoms

For me, this was the hardest workout in the series.  It was so hard in fact that I don't always have the energy to do the Blizzard at the end.  I couldn't match Cathes weights on the upper body sections.  My heart rate was elevated the entire time.

Cathe says Amanda is the modifier, but Amanda was using the same step height as Cathe for the entire workout. A better modification would have been to have Amanda use a lower step height for the entire workout.

The warm up is a basic step moves on a step with 2 risers per side.  The routine is several rounds of cardio, lower body, upper body and core work.

Some fun, new exercises include:  Sumo squat turning, single arm swimmer plank, 1 arm burpees on the step.  For some of the bicep and shoulder exercises, you do a lot of reps and then freeze in a holding pattern.  Talk about ouch!

The Blizzard was tough; it consists of jumping off and on to the step.  The step is set with 3 risers per side.",1452988800,7,1145,4.339622641509434
8746066,5,B019WMTLOW,Cathe's workouts are great! You won't be disappointed.,1513728000,,54,5.875
8746067,2,B019WMTLOW,"As a big workout fan of Cathe but nearly 60 with a bum knee and a weak ankle, I bit off more than I could chew on this one.  Way too up tempo on the step portion (about 50% of the workout). I realize I could slow down the tempo, but that's NO FUN for old ladies like me.  So I will try to sell this on ebay.",1486512000,,307,3.5
8746068,4,B019WMTLOW,"I like Cathe, but I wanted a slightly less extreme workout, but still challenging.  This fits the bill.  It's not Tabata or to the Max workouts,  but still a good workout for those less motivated days.",1482883200,,201,4.527777777777778
8746069,5,B019WMTLOW,I tried this workout yesterday morning. It was pretty great. Definitely makes you sweat. But like they say sweat is fat crying. It does have a lot of lunges off the step. Your legs are going to be on fire. Just push through it and tell yourself you can do it. I highly recommend this dvd. I actually bought the bundle of the ice series. This was my first dvd to try. Can't wait to try the rest.,1482883200,,394,4.064102564102564
8746070,5,B019WMTLOW,"Best one of of all the ICE workouts so far.  I don't have all the dvds but I have approximately 5... this one is the most challenging out of the group.  I was hesitant to buy these because they're intermediate and typically I prefer advanced. I am glad I went ahead and purchased.  I recently hurt my back and these were all perfect for my lower impact days.  This one was the only one I didn't do while recovering.  There is more jumping but you can modify if necessary. She does use the step at 10 inches which I think is great.  However, you can keep it lower if you'd like and work your way up to the higher level. I feel this leans more towards intermediate/advanced.  I love the setup for this entire series because there's so many options.  You can use lighter weights or heavier to give you more of a burn and you can adjust your step height and modify moves that require more impact.  I have many of Cathe's dvds and she never disappoints. I have to say this is my favorite series she's put out so far. I hope she keeps on doing what she's doing because she is the best!!",1471737600,7,1080,4.203883495145631
8746071,3,B019WMTLOW,OK  There are several others of hers I like more.  This one has a lot of step moves in it.,1471564800,2,90,3.45
8746072,4,B019WMTLOW,Love cathes videos. This one is a great mix of exercises.,1471392000,,57,4.2727272727272725
8746073,5,B019WMTLOW,I love all of Cathe's new ICE workouts. The Bootcamp Circuit is well paced and perfectly cued.  One can control the intensity by choosing a heavier weight so the workout is good for both intermediate and advanced exercisers.,1465948800,4,224,4.894736842105263
8746074,4,B019WMTLOW,"I'm in love with Cathe's ICE series and while I don't have every disk this isn't my favorite; however, it won't be gathering dust like ""Rock'm Sock'm"" has (I have nothing against the workout but prefer more metabolically challenging routines).  Everything is done in a circuit so all parts of the body are worked and for that reason alone I'll be reaching for this video quite often.  Cathe does one exercise that is cardiovascular using a step, one weighted exercise for both the upper body and lower body and finishes with a focus on the core.  There is also a bonus blizzard blast, an Icy core segment and plenty of premixes so it's worth it for the variety alone.

My main issue is the step.  I have two risers on each side but Cathe bumps it up to three (or four?) halfway through and I don't have the equipment.  I have to watch my knees so I try to avoid anything involving a step (let alone a ton of risers!) but I've found that if I keep it low I still get decent cardio without killing the joints.  Cathe herself advises adjusting the step's height to suit your needs so if you follow that example your entire body is worked but not too intensely.  It's great for a ""light day.""  I haven't done the blizzard blast because of my problems with the step but I have done the Icy core bonus and it's challenging enough.

Don't skip this DVD if you have the same issues that I do when it comes to the step - circuit training is fantastic with or without the cardio bonus and of course Cathe is wonderful!",1463875200,4,1508,4.334519572953736
8746075,5,B019WMTLOW,"Being an intermediate exerciser and not a fan of complicated step routines, I love this circuit workout. And I like that I still have energy to do at least one muscle meltdown segment afterwards.",1457481600,,195,4.764705882352941
