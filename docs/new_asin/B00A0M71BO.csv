8545918,5,B00A0M71BO,"It's a great series produced by the BBC and issued by Schlessinger.  There are 16 total in the Math Challenge set (3D shapes, Compliments, Decimals, Decimals Adding, Doubles & Halves, Equations, Equivalent Fractions, Fractions, Integers, Multiples & Factors, Number Patterns, Operations with Large Numbers, Percentages, Rounding Numbers, Shapes, Zeros).  The entire set new, retail costs about $320 (ISBN: 1-4171-0543-7); and individually they're $19.95.  My six-year-old saw Compliments and really enjoyed it (and seeing it out-of-sequence or without the others didn't detract from the enjoyment), which is why daddy was hunting for more..  They are pricey compared to the SDS DVD's, but they're pretty entertaining in the James Bond'ish theme, villian, and British accent.",1451260800,,774,5.823008849557522
