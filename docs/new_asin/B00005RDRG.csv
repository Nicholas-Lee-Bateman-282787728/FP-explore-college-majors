7952173,3,B00005RDRG,"The story line continues to move slowly with sudden seemingly random jumps.  Character development is either non-existant, or is accompished in three actions and moves people forward as if years have occured.
I am still not a fan of the mixed style of Anime that is used for this story line.  Using computer generated images for the 'Goddesses' while in combat brings memories of older video game movies that were not the best.
Overall, the story and content are average, and the feeble attempts at hiding what is in store for the 'heroes' is not done as well as it could have been.  This series straddles between trying to be the seriousness of Gasarki, and the silliness of older 'fighting robot' shows.",1012953600,,705,4.762295081967213
