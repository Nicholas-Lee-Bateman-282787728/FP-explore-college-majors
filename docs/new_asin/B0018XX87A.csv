3421513,2,B0018XX87A,"Even with a stellar line up and as a great standard French crime flic(k) this edition is second rate. The film is dubbed in English and has no language or sub title options. In its original French, this would be a classic to watch and enjoy but the dubbing is second rate and spoils the whole feel of the movie, so look for the French language version if you can find one.",1243468800,8,372,4.180555555555555
3421514,4,B0018XX87A,"And the award for most outrageous sexual symbolism of 1969 goes to Alain Delon, for his performance battering an eel to death on a rock after catching a glimpse of Irina Demick's body double nude sunbathing in The Sicilian Clan...

Despite the title, this 1969 flic et voyou flick is definitely NOT a mob movie: the clan are a family of Sicilian crooks in France headed by Jean Gabin who spring Alain Delon from jail for a massive jewel robbery, with Lino Ventura's dogged cop on the trail. Based on a novel by Rififi author Auguste le Breton, there's little that's original (although the heist itself is spectacularly ingenious), but it's put together with polish and style and makes for an entertaining couple of hours. Henry Verneuil's direction raises the standard, while Delon, Ventura and Irina Demick offer good value. The once-great Gabin fares less well - although it's nice to see him reunited with his Touchez Pas le Grisbi nemesis Ventura in a couple of scenes, for much of the film he's more of an immoveable monument than much of a presence, only really coming across in his final scene, which taps in nicely to the resigned fatalism of his pre-war classics.

It's not an all-time great, but it is an entertaining and atmospheric French thriller that nicely fills a couple of hours.

Fox's UK PAL Region 2 DVD boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer of the English-language version (the film was shot in French, Italian and English-language versions rather than simply dubbed) and includes the US trailer.",1210550400,9,1520,4.861003861003861

3421560,2,B0018XX87A,"Somewhere, in amongst two agonizing hours, is a pretty interesting heist flick. But it's completely buried under a ton of ridiculous Euro-drama and slow-bleed plot.

Thankfully, as always, there's the fast-forward.

You can honestly spin through the entire flick by stopping every ten minutes, watching for one or two minutes, then shifting another ten without missing a beat. Wish I had done that from the beginning, having suffered through an initial thirty-five minutes hoping the damn thing would kick into gear.

It never does.

The best comes in the last fifteen minutes or so. I won't spoil it for those brave enough to withstand late-1970's Euro-crap. The heist itself is somewhat engaging, but is a very tiny reward for enduring such complete mind-numbing boredom.

I suspect that a great deal of what ""sold"" the film back then (given that there were no home videos and therefore no fast-forward button) were the brief scenes of female nudity. And if I had any clue who these French/Italian actresses were, I might appreciate it more. But to quote an old advertising slogan, ""We've come a long way baby"". The aged flesh screened for audiences back then must've been titillating, risque and oh-so-Continental. But today, it's not only tame, it almost seems quaint.

Not that I'm advocating blatant sex as a means of modern filmmaking, far from it. But given the worldwide consumption of so-called adult entertainment, and the stunning array of venues from which one can choose from, the 70's seems like so very long ago. Another world almost.

I would wish for a reboot with modern sensibilities and timing, but I suspect the days of showcasing an airliner being hijacked by anti-heroes is long gone.

A film for fans of master composer Ennio Morricone only.",1386460800,,1766,5.003412969283277

The plot is almost simple but intriguing: A suspected felon is liberated through a tricky setup by the people who need his 'services'. But during the staging time for a new 'coup' this man starts an affair with the wife of one of his co-clansmen. Because of this the mutual respect and cooperation turns into hate and 'professional' performance goes down.

There must be a reason but I haven't the faintest and it's so depressing because about a dozen KLs are among my top favorite movies of all time.
