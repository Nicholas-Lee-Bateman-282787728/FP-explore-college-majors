8455163,5,B0053CBSRY,I have ordered it twice. The first time there was nothing on the disc and the second time it is a foreign film in Spanish but I cannot convert it to English on my computers,1491264000,,172,3.942857142857143
8455164,5,B0053CBSRY,Well I had to purchase a DVD player that would play Region 2 movies. But that was only a $45 purchase. Now I get to see lots of movies that they won't put out in DVD form for USA players. I love the setting - wine vineyards - California! Glad I bought it! Worth every cent!,1435622400,3,273,3.892857142857143
