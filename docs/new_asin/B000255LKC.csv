2063016,2,B000255LKC,"This is not a review of this specific title, but rather of Warner Brothers' ""TV Premiere DVD"" series as a whole.  I would like to make you aware of my issues with features that are apparently prevalent in ALL of the titles in this series, based upon my purchase of one of these titles (""The Flintstones - The Flintstone Flyer"").

Although the list of issues below was written specifically for The Flintstones DVD, I highly suspect that most (if not all) of it applies to this and all of the other titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series.  Be sure to check out The Flintstones page to see the photos that I uploaded which better illustrate the packaging and disc printing issues mentioned below.

-- The disc does not come in a plastic case, but rather in a cardboard sleeve which opens on the side.  I've purchased $1 public domain DVDs from no-name companies that came in plastic slim cases, so it's appalling that a $6 DVD from a big-name company would be done so cheaply.  Also, the sleeve has a hole at the top in the center where the peg would go for it to be hung on a rack like an action figure or toy.  The hole has been edited out of the promo photos that Warner Bros. gave Amazon to display for the DVDs.

-- The text on the disc is very faint and hard to read - another way Warner Bros. skimped on production costs.

-- The cheapness doesn't stop at the packaging.  The DVD does not contain a menu, not even a plain one.  Because of this, there's an interesting glitch that happens if you let the DVD play past the episode.  You see, after the episode plays, it goes to a FBI Warning on title 3, which then goes to the non-existent menu, so the player just hangs on a black screen.

-- They were even cheap in the placement of the chapters marks, which are placed every ten minutes (0:00, 10:00, and 20:00) no matter if it makes sense in the episode content for one to be there or not.

-- From what I've read, most (if not all) of the titles in the ""TV Premiere DVD"" series were originally released on VHS and/or laserdisc, with these DVDs being done from the VHS and laserdisc masters.  The quality of The Flintstones DVD definitely appears to be better than VHS, so either it came from a laserdisc master, or not all of the titles were done from old home video masters.

Although at first I didn't mind paying $6 for one 26 minute Flintstones episode, that was before I knew that the DVD didn't even come in a plastic case.  Now that six dollars really seems like a rip-off.

2063017,5,B000255LKC,I bought this video because I remembered how much I enjoyed watching Gilligan as a kid and wanted my kids to see it too.  My five year old thinks Gilligan is just hilarious!  We laughed and laughed. I don't mind that it is colorized. The part where Gilligan and Skipper are out on the raft and the sharks eat the raft was great.,1057104000,,328,4.190476190476191
2063018,4,B000255LKC,"Excellent episodes, but they've been colorized.  I was so surprised to see these episodes in color (I didn't even have a color TV when I saw these the first time).  It was quite disconcerting to see these episodes in color.  Also, they seem to have been edited: the skipper doesn't ever hit Gilligan with his hat (or maybe he started doing that in later episodes?)....
I would have given it 5 stars if it had been in B&W (original format).",1011657600,,439,4.4625
8022339,3,B000255LKC,"If you already own Gilligan's Island, season one Do Not buy this! It's just two regular episodes form the first season. I didn't realize that until I got it here. I have owned the complete set for years, and watch it often. However, I don't know each show by name. I thought I had lucked on to two of the movies that were made later.

For a few dollars more, you can buy the complete series. Don't waste your money on this!

It's not opened, so will probably go back.",1513641600,,467,4.177777777777778

8022348,3,B000255LKC,"I bought this item at the same time I purchased the complete three seasons of Gilligan's Island. I opened this product first, and then the box set. I found out that these two episodes are included in the Season 1 DVD package. If you are getting this DVD to see if you want to get the whole season, then I'd say it's not such a waste of money (but heed the prior poster's comments warning about the cheap packaging). This product was released AFTER the Season 1 box set, so there should have been some notation that these two episodes were also included in the Season 1 box set. I was under the impression that these two episodes were separate from the box set. As I have opened the product now (but haven't watched it), I'm stuck with it, unless I can sell it or perhaps donate it to some charity. If you intend to buy either Season 1 or entire three-season collection of Gilligan's Island, don't bother with this DVD, unless you're getting it for the sake of being a collector. I don't think it's worth it.",1177459200,,1007,4.361702127659575
