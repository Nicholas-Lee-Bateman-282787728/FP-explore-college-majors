8576517,3,B00C2FTK6G,"This is a college lecture. While I am interested in ancient history, I think this was over my head, as I don't have much knowledge of Hammurabi at this time. I'm betting this is an upper level lecture, meant for students who already know the topics being discussed. I still found enough to keep my interest though.",1527984000,,314,4.526315789473684
8576518,4,B00C2FTK6G,I needed an introduction into the importance of Hammurabi and his code of laws for a college level class. It was extremely useful to me as it led me in several directions for my research. It outlined enough points that it was an excellent starting point.,1500595200,,254,4.543478260869565

8576521,1,B00C2FTK6G,"I bought it for my 6th Grade class to watch to help them understand Hammurabi.  It was my mistake, because it was a lecture only, and so far over their heads I had to stop the video 7 minutes in.  I'm sure the gentleman giving the lecture if very knowledgable; however, it was not what I was looking for and therefore a waste of money.",1383868800,,335,4.138461538461539
