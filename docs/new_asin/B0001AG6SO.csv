1984261,5,B0001AG6SO,"This film, AKA ""Full Circle,"" is based on author Peter Straub's (of ""Ghost Story"" and ""The Talisman"") novel ""Julia."" It is a pretty good adaption of the book and holds up after all these years. When you see it, you realize that not much new and innovative has really been done since this time period. Let's hope for a DVD release soon!!!",1086393600,8,337,4.451612903225806
1984262,5,B0001AG6SO,"A terrific, creeeeepy, psycho-thriller that keeps you guessing until the very last shot!! Mia Farrow ""sees dead people"" in 1981--WAY before ""The 6th Sense""-- in a far superior film. Also, this film inspired a Japanese semi-homage, along with 1983's ""The Entity"" (starring Barbara Hershey), 1988's Asian cult film, ""Evil Dead Trap."" Check this one out first!",1083024000,4,357,5.392857142857143
1984263,5,B0001AG6SO,"I saw this film for the first time as a young girl, and was scared to death! I had a vivid imagination, and that's what you needed when you watched horror films back then. They just don't make films like this anymore! Watched this on FearNet today and wanted to purchase it, but it's not on dvd. Mia Farrow is great, and the film stands the test of time!",1310774400,,354,4.144927536231884
1984264,5,B0001AG6SO,"It has been many years since I have seen this wonderful film.  I've watched teasers on youtube, which confirm that it is as good as I remembered.  Very atmospheric ""ghost"" story, for want of a better word.  Mia Farrow gives a good performance, and probably best of all is the music by Colin Towns.  If the rights owners are reading these reviews, please, please release this on DVD - preferably mastered from a good source.  And I'd like to see the Colin Town's soundtrack out too on CD!",1264636800,7,487,4.488636363636363
1984265,3,B0001AG6SO,"I watched ""The Haunting of Julia"" many years ago, and just re-watched it again last night. While it has some genuinely creepy moments, a good cast, and great atmospherics, I found myself mostly unmoved by the film.

""The Haunting of Julia"" is far inferior to Nicholas Roeg's similarly themed classic, ""Don't Look Now."" In both films, the central character is haunted by the death of a child, and brought into mortal peril by the obsessive pursuit of what appears may be that child's spirit. However, what is missing in ""Julia"" is the sense of genuine tragedy to go along with the forboding of doom.

A big part of the problem may be Mia Farrow, whose admittedly striking features and wardrobe cannot overcome the essential inertness of her performance. In ""Don't Look Now,"" Donald Sutherland seems obsessed and driven, but not as stubbornly foolish as Farrow's character does. The agonizing climax of ""Don't Look Now"" seems both shocking and inevitable, while the climax of ""The Haunting of Julia"" seems rather random and dismal. Watch ""The Haunting of Julia"" if you want to, but afterwards, check out the much more worthwhile ""Don't Look Now.""",1249344000,3,1144,4.953125

ever!
i love mia farrow

1984267,4,B0001AG6SO,"I saw part of this movie on TV when I was in college well over twenty years ago and the chilling images (some shown and some just implied) have stayed with me all this time. I was delighted to see my cable provider is showing it as part of the ""on demand"" feature and I finally watched the movie in it entirety this afternoon.

Mia Farrow is perfectly cast as poor vulnerable Julia an American heiress living in London with her husband who seems more interested in her cash than her.  When their beloved eight year old daughter tragically chokes to death at breakfast (if they had only known the Heimlich maneuver) her all ready weak marriage falls apart and she rents a huge furnished town home though her husband and his sister continually make efforts to woo Julia and her money back.  In her new home Julia senses the spirit of a child trying to make contact with her and after a seance is held and the medium reports ""horrible things"" she is determined to find out more.  A string of tragic deaths follow Julia as she researches the house's history and at the film's very sad conclusion the viewer realizes the meaning of the alternative title FULL CIRCLE.

The film is very creepy and atmospheric thanks to both the dreary London location and the haunting score that perfectly complements the film.  Like many good ghost stores there is some ambiguity left as to whether this is a haunted house movie, a story of the living being possessed by the dead or just a tale of a person losing their sanity. Although the plot is basically coherent there are a few scenes which are confusing and the film would be better if they were more clearly rendered. The movie is based on Peter Straub's novel JULIA and I understand many people find the book much superior to the film and I have just placed it on my ""to be read"" list.",1220054400,9,1822,4.47289156626506
1984268,5,B0001AG6SO,"I remember seeing this movie on TV one night when I was a kid, maybe 25 years ago or so and its stuck with me all these years.  I could never remember the movie's title but I always remember it as the movie where the little girl dies while choking on an apple.  there were many other scary things in this film involving the ghost of the little girl but after 25 years they are all just sort of dreamlike nightmarish visions now.  I've been trying to locate a copy of this on dvd as I dion't know a VHS player anymore.

But for a horror film that I haven't seen in almost 25 years that is just now vague memories and hazy visions to have stuck with me for this long says something about the film.  I've spent years having this film pop into my head and spent many nights at my computer trying to find it online based manily on ""its the film where the little girl dies while shen she chokes on an apple""

I'm sure now this movie probably won;t scare me but when I was a kid it was one of the most frightening things I'd ever seen.  Hopefully it someday comes to dvd.",1206921600,4,1064,4.062200956937799
1984269,5,B0001AG6SO,"This movie should be on DVD.  Richard Loncraine successfully translates Peter Straub's magnificent novel ""Julia"" to the screen with Mia Farrow at her post-""Rosemary's Baby"" best.  Watching this creepy, elegantly demented little train-wreck is not unlike having a particularly frightening experience under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug, I imagine.

Julia Lofting, a wealthy American woman living in London, loses her child in a tragic and ugly accident (the girl chokes to death on a piece of fruit in the opening scene) and things spiral downward from there to say the very least.

Divorcing her insensitive and callous husband, Lofting elects to rent an apartment which was formerly inhabited by a dysfunctional family with a little girl who also died very young and who was quite troublesome--involved, in fact, in the murder of another boy.  Farrow's already unstable character becomes obsessed with the girl and the rest is, you might say, supernatural history.  The mood of the film is tragic, ethereal, dreamlike, and nasty as hell.  The last scene will not leave the viewer's mind for quite awhile.

With all the trash out there called ""horror"" these days, it really puzzles me why they don't dredge this one up and throw it onto the shelves in a decent format.  It is a superb example of what the macabre can do in the hands of the right director.  A must see.",1187136000,7,1377,4.947826086956522
1984270,5,B0001AG6SO,"This is truly a fine, well-made, frightening film.  The filmmakers did an excellent job of using lighting, editing, music, etc. to create a menacing mood that leads inexorably to the conclusion of the film.  THIS FILM IS WORTHY OF A DVD RELEASE.",1150761600,2,245,4.809523809523809
1984271,4,B0001AG6SO,"This is a very slow moving and understated ghost story starring Mia Farrow in a typicaly frail and delicate role as a woman named Julia who has a nervous breakdown following the accidental the death of her daughter. She moves to a large London townhouse to try and recover, but soon starts seeing visions of a ghostly young girl, and wonders if her daughter has come back from the dead. There is indeed a ghost - but unfortunately for Julia, it's not her daughter.

Mia Farrow excels in the title role of Julia. She has a unique ability of expressing fragility that few other actresses can acheive without making you want to slap them. You only feel compassion and empathy for the character of Julia while watching her face the unknown and try to work out who or what is trying to make contact with her in the big lonely house she has retreated to. The mood of the film reminded me a lot of ""Don't Look Now"", but the structure of the story is more similar to ""The Changeling"", in so far as having a grieving parent make contact with the spirit of a long dead child while recovering from the trauma of their own loss. I'm not sure which is the better of the two ghost stories, but ""The Haunting of Julia"" is certainly the slower of the two and lasks the complex secrets and supernatural manifestations of ""The Changeling"".

But that's not to say that this film is without effective scares. One of it's nastier surprises is the opening scene in which Julia's daughter actually dies - it's a cruel and upsetting death that unsurprisingly leaves Julia with a huge sense of guilt - and a horrible scenario to imagine for any parent. The remainder of the film spends a lot of time exploring Julia's state of mind, so don't be surprised if you feel as though not a lot of ""haunting"" is actually going on...but if you are prepared to enjoy this as a character study of an unbalanced woman, the revelations of the story will become much more effective. The acting is good all round as is the camera work, with a lot of slightly soft-focus shots adding a sombre mood to many scenes.

I am not going to reveal any more about the plot, which is a shame because that means I can't tell you about the amazing ending. It's not totally unexpected, in fact there is every indication that the film expects you to realise that it is inevitable, but it's still incredibly poignant - probably more so for that very reason, with a very, very slow final revolving camera shot that gives a quite chilling effect to the scene. Worth waiting for.

The film as a whole is also worth your time - if you can find a copy, as there is currently no DVD release, which is a shame considering the trash that keeps turning up on DVD these days. Possibly something of a lost film, it has never had a huge following outside of a small cult fan-base. This could easily change with the right marketing, along with restoring it to it's proper widescreen ration, as the video copy I used to have was in pan 'n' scan, which ruined the presentation generally but also seriously mis-framed a lot of very important shots. I'd love to see it in widescreen, and if it came out like that on DVD, I'd buy it without hesitation.",1149638400,22,3178,4.436643835616438
1984272,5,B0001AG6SO,"Never mind the excellent movie - ""The Haunting Of Julia"" (a.k.a. ""Full Circle"") has one of the creepiest opening and main theme songs ever featured in a movie! This one came on TV when I was a kid one night, and the song has really stuck with me, as well as the movie. Enough of the song, this movie is a great example that you don't have to have expensive and fancy computer effects to make a movie scary. In a way, I kind of pity today's teenaged kids who only know a scary movie by virtue of it's computer effects and not it's story, mood or narrative. I'm sure all of us ""older"" folks have stories of when we were kids and we stayed up one night on a Saturday night and a scary movie came on one of the UHF channels to chill us all to the bone!",1087516800,19,748,3.993333333333333
8009245,4,B0001AG6SO,"This movie is actually better than the book it's based on. Mia/ Julia loses a child and things go down hill from there. Deep loss, large creepy houses, evil children and ghosts make this a must watch. A wonderfully haunting soundtrack and beautiful cinematography only add to the fright. Slowly paced but worth the time. It desperately needs a Blu-ray or DVD release in English.",1509062400,,378,4.8307692307692305

*Plot and ending analyzed*

The Haunting of Julia, or Full Circle, is a haunting film that really has a moody aura about it. Everything is perfect in this, from the music, to the acting, to the faded print of the film, to the weird dubbing-like quality of the sound. The later two are unintended effects of the age of the film.

The film to me, is one of the classic preternatural films, that leaves you with more questions than answers.

I also read the novel ""Julia"" by Peter Straub beforehand. The novel is highly disappointing, especial the ending. But both may please one's senses if they enjoy such works.

8009249,1,B0001AG6SO,"After reading the high rated reviews I was very disappointed in this slow moving, poorly edited bleak production.  The background music sets the tone but when one notices the background music so much, you know something is wrong with the story.  So many questions are left unanswered.  Who killed the ghost girl?  Why is she evil?  What does a husband die in a house and his body never discovered?  The continuity is disruptive.  Mia Farrow plays Mia Farrow in her usual withdrawn, poor me little girl.  Never is there a scarey moment except for the death of the child at the beginning.  People die inexplicably but nobody cares.  I am very surprised that so many people rated this boring waste of time so highly.",1470268800,,713,4.67741935483871

8009253,5,B0001AG6SO,"I haven't watched ""The Haunting of Julia"" in a while and I have to say it improves upon repeated viewings. This is a slow-moving, atmospheric horror film that doesn't have to resort to gory death scenes or over the top special effects to deliver chills. The film was alternately titled ""Full Circle"" for its release in the UK (1977) and ""The Haunting of Julia"" in the US (1981). I have a feeling the latter title was chosen to drum up more enthusiasm for the film, although I don't think it fared too well either way.

It's a pity really as I really liked this film. A woman, Julia (Mia Farrow) is grieving the death of her only daughter and flees her unhappy marriage. She moves into a London townhome and begins to think that her dead daughter's spirit is haunting her. However, a seance leads to her discovering that her house, though indeed haunted, is being haunted by an evil specter in the form of the spirit of a vengeful young girl. As Julia digs deeper, things spiral out of control leading to several deaths.

""Don't Look Now"" starring Donald Sutherland and ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott are two other movies that feature a grieving parent dealing with supernatural events. There have also been numerous made-for-TV films with similar plots. However, ""The Haunting of Julia"" and ""Don't Look Now"" remain high on my list of must-see films, especially if you're a fan of supernatural horror. If you're familiar with Japanese horror films, ""Dark Water"" also contains a similar theme of a troubled and lonely spirit. The score in ""The Haunting of Julia"" deserves special mention because it is truly haunting and creepy. This is not for everyone, and certainly not for fans of the slasher and gory type of horror films. However, if you like atmospheric supernatural-themed films with excellent character development, then this might be worth a watch.",1401753600,3,1863,4.81875
8009254,3,B0001AG6SO,I also remember watching this movie on tv late one night when I was a kid like a lot of people. I remember that first scene when her daughter chokes and that was all I remembered from the movie and just that scene was so creepy! I just watched it again after about 30 years and they do not make movies like this anymore! Just really creepy! The ending was also very creepy! Good scary movie!,1345161600,3,391,4.157894736842105
