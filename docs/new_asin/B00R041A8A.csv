8693611,1,B00R041A8A,"Willy (Brian Hooks) is on trial for something he did at the airport. The story then goes to a flashback told by Chad (George Snarberg) who wasn't present for most of the flashback. Willy and Stanley (Chico Benymon) work for Mr Bruce (Wes Armstrong) who is a criminal type but the plot doesn't develop enough for us to really know what he does. Stanley falls for Lilly (Rosalie McIntire) Chad's girlfriend even though she has two hot friends who like him and don't have boyfriends. In a bizarre plot spoiler scene Stanly lies about a family emergency only to get a Louisville clock cleaning crime of passion. He is in the hospital as Mr. Bruce beats Willie because Stanley lied and he didn't tell him he was lying. It was such a weird scene that highlighted the fact the script writer was stoned when he wrote this.

 The script was full of holes and downright idiotic. The acting was awful. I can't believe I watched this all the way through.
