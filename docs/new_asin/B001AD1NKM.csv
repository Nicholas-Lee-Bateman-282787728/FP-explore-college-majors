4430255,3,B001AD1NKM,"This sequel to '7 GOLDEN MEN' (read my review) misses its mark more often than not. The print quality isn`t as good as the first, and is marred by a white bar at the top of the picture frame that`s distracting. The script is a retread of the first film for the most part - The 'Professor' (Phillipe Leroy) and his men are captured by U.S. agents during an attempted train robbery. To avoid jail, they must kidnap a Latin dictator. From there, it`s the same stuff we saw in the original. We`re back to stealing 7 thousand tons in gold bars, only now to finance a revolution. This time out, 'the Professor' is an arrogant, irksome twit and not the clever double-crossing mastermind he was in the first film. Rossana Podesta is still adorable as the cute Eurovixen, but the constant wigs, costumes and contact lens eye color changes were wearysome but forgivable on someone that delectable. Under-utilized, she was little more than eye-candy, capable of more. The 7 Golden Men were reduced to Snow White`s 7 Stooges this time, and will have your finger poised on the fast-forward button periodically. Parts 'Thunderball' (the underwater sequences),'In Like Flint' (another inferior sequel),'The Dirty Dozen' (the action scenes w/ the revolutionaries), and EuroBankHeist flick, I thought it over-reached and fell short. But decent, campy, low-budget fun? Probably. Deserving of shelf space in your permanent collection? Not really. And the soundtrack varied from annoying to incongrous with the movie, probably stock music except for the title theme. Only for hardcore 60`s Eurospy fans and cult completists, try renting instead. It IS obscure and the price is right, you might purchase to watch and unload on Amazon or Ebay afterwards.",1267228800,4,1732,5.038327526132404
4430256,4,B001AD1NKM,"The film TOPKAPI(1964) was such a huge International success (spawning 'Mission: Impossible' here in the states) along w/ the JAMES BOND franchise going global, that there were many European imitators, giving way to the 'Eurospy' genre. 7 GOLDEN MEN (1965) w/ Philippe Leroy, Rossana Podesta, Gabriele Tinti and a host of other  character actors, is a hybrid of the two - one part espionage, one part bank heist caper, and succeeds for the most part on both levels. The scheme is to break into the Credit Suisse Bank during lunchtime (O those Europeans w/ their 2 hour lunch breaks) from underground, tunneling right through the streets in broad daylight(!) and hauling away millions in gold bars via service trucks. I won`t give more of the plot away, but it`s full of twists and double-crosses, and resolves nicely. Leroy is fine as 'the Professor', the mastermind behind the details, and Rossana Podesta is quite the alluring, curvacious EuroCherub, attired in a variety of wigs (so popular back then) and revealing outfits from that time period. (Why we didn`t see more of her in the 60`s is beyond me - she had 'that look' so popular for Eurovixen roles, and could be soft and cute as well). It was a different look than American actresses had. All in all a good time viewing, and the price is right (it`s a burned dvd-r) for a lightweight obscure oddity from those fab 60`s.",1267228800,16,1380,4.7740585774058575
4430257,5,B001AD1NKM,Great Movie. Very interesting and well made. Podestta and the other actors were great. I saw this movie in Cuba (1967)and I like it very much. I'm giving to this movie 5 stars with no hesitation at all.,1238889600,3,202,4.342105263157895
4430258,2,B001AD1NKM,"My expectations about this film were maybe too high due to Some reviews I found around the web. It's a pop italian film from the 60s but I expected it to be more entertaining, while instead it just relies on some scenes which give it a vintage taste. As a whole, the film is a little boring and weak, although well shot",1402790400,2,319,4.161290322580645
4430259,5,B001AD1NKM,One of the best in its genre. Few dialogues - just the necessary -  and rest is the fantastic soundtrack and a group of artisits work together like na orchestra!,1379462400,2,161,4.366666666666666

4430261,5,B001AD1NKM,"This is a classic movie that was well remastered. Good picture and sound quality.
This movie set the trend toward bank heist and is the golden standard that

4430264,3,B001AD1NKM,"Unfortunately this is a rather disappointing sequel in a lot of respects, but there is still much to enjoy.

Our heroes get stopped mid-job and The Professor reveals that he's been showing off for the US government and the ""LBI"" - now the team has an assignment of international import.

As it turns out they kidnap and return a Castro-like socialist dictator of a Cuba-like island, all the while plotting to steal a boatload of communist gold that's inexplicably moored in the local harbor.  That plot is not very well laid out to the viewer - one of the great features of the first movie was that you understood what was going on intuitively without the movie having to stop and explain, but you'll be confused in parts for the lack of explanation here.  Just think of it as a Mission: Impossible episode, or more accurately two episodes happening at once.

Most of the characters are holdovers from the previous film (or at least all the important ones are), but at times they act rather inexplicably different than in the prior movie.  For example, Adolf the German turns from a sympathetic thief into a national stereotype, Georgia goes too far overboard for fake Castro (at least she has a bigger part!), and the Professor is a little bit too overbearing (for example, when he out-interrogates the ""LBI"").  The rather mean-spirited gunfight between the boys towards the end serves no purpose to the plot (except, I guess, to help set up the false endings in some way) and undermines the viewer's connection to the ""team"" (as though the IMF started shooting at each other after a mission while Jim had his back turned).

There is a ton of creativity on display, though, from arty camera angles to intentionally-cheesy props (or am I just assuming metahumor?).  Overall the film doesn't drag, and certainly I don't regret watching it.  But compared to the classic original, SEVEN GOLDEN MEN STRIKE AGAIN falls a bit flat.

(Print is considerably more damaged than the first SEVEN GOLDEN MEN as well.)",1316649600,,2004,4.796511627906977
4430265,4,B001AD1NKM,"Congrats to Sinister, this looks nearly as good as some standard studio releases.  A completely engaging heist movie that spends about half the running time on the actual job and half on the double-crossing getaway.  A candidate for a remake?  Lovely Geneva (and Rome) location shooting and very inventive storytelling - if this was a low budget film you can't see it.

I will say that the original W7 movie poster somewhat mischaracterizes the role of the leading lady.",1315612800,2,470,4.9113924050632916
4430266,3,B001AD1NKM,"Excellent 60's Gold Heist movie with gorgeous and Shapely 60s sex goddess - Rosanna Podesta, a pleasure to watch even though the quality of this DVD transfer by Sinister cinema is like watching a pan/scan bad VHS video. I have
a VHS copy from Something Weird collection which is much better in quality than this Sinister Cinema DVD.
Its a great movie to watch with a nice twisting plot, too bad this DVD is such a poor quality, but watchable.",1291680000,5,442,4.5375
4430267,4,B001AD1NKM,"This has to be one of the best of the flood of 60's heist movies.  The heist is clever, the plot twists interesting, and the characters all endearing.

Like most of these films of this era, its marred by the necessity to have them fail at the end.  But that was a requirement of the genre... crime could ALMOST pay... but never quite.

Sinister Cinema transfers can vary in quality but they had a good original here and the quality, while not up to the expensive modern ""restored"" prints being made of big ticket movies, is quite watchable and enjoyable.",1277337600,4,554,4.51
8436053,5,B001AD1NKM,"If 1965's The Seven Golden Men was akin to Mission: Impossible, then the sequel is pure James Bond, complete with submarines, hovercraft, jet packs and gadgets galore. This time out the United States Government recruit the Professor and his band of bold thieves to kidnap the General - a bushy bearded, Communist dictator of a small Central American island (read Fidel Castro). The requested fee for this service: seven million dollars, naturally, plus the deed to their own private island and absolution for all past misdeeds. However while Giorgia is sent off to seduce the General, and our gold happy crew put the elaborate clockwork plan into motion, the Professor casts his eye toward his real prize: a tanker harbored at the island country with seven thousand tons of gold bricks in its hold.

The Seven Golden Men Strike Again is more outrageous than its predecessor. The set pieces are bigger, the gimmicks are more elaborate and the humor is far less subtle.  The Seven Golden Men Strike Again is still an entertaining romp of the kind that could only have been produced in the swinging, psychedelic '60s.",1524528000,,1114,4.920212765957447

8436055,5,B001AD1NKM,"This spoofs Castro and his Russian Missles in the Cuba missle crisis in the 60's when there wrere tons of em in Cuba- of course, Hitchcock's Topaz is about an American spy who successfully sneaked out photographs of the missles and took them to America, passed a rigorious search and inspections, and avoided being killed when tons of other spies were killed and he helped avert the crises in which JFK solved. So, in this film, the professional bank robbers were caught, but they were given a deal in which they use their cat-like heist skills to steal 7,000 pounds of gold that is being used to fund revolution for a Castro-like leader who is building missle bases on an island. The tricks, Femme Chatte HOney Trap sneaky tricks, the gadgets, the scheme, is fabulous! Ohhh this film is so beauitful!

Seven Golden Men: is an Italian heist film; brilliant and groovy directed by Marco Vicario starring Rossana Podest and Philippe. Full of twists, smart criminals, dumb criminals, glamour Bond inspired 60's gadgets

Albert, ""The Professor"" an international criminal mastermind plan to rob a Geneva bank of 7 tons of gold. Assisted by his seductive accomplice, Giorgia, who works from within the bank, and six other accomplices, Albert sets himself up in an expensive hotel with a battery of electronic devices to supervise the operation.

Posing as a street-repair crew, the six accomplices tunnel their way into the city's water mains and, guided by a radar signaling device left by Giorgia in a safe-deposit box, swim to a spot beneath the bank vault. Albert, aided by a closed-circuit television camera hidden in the bank, steers his men by walkie-talkies to the vault.

After the gold has been disguised as brass and shipped to Rome, Albert tries to double-cross his accomplices by notifying the police that the men are carrying fake passports; Giorgia, in turn, attempts to double-cross Albert while they are travelling to Rome by train. Both schemes backfire, however, and the eight thieves arrive in Rome to split the loot.

Before they can do so, the truck carrying the gold crashes and scatters its contents on the street pavement. Frustrated but undaunted, the group begin making plans to rob the largest bank in Rome. It was such a huge International success a sequel (Seven Golden Men Strike Again)",1455840000,,1624,5.003703703703704
