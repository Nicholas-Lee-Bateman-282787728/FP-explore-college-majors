7682620,1,B01CE21F8M,Poor production and extremely dated,1471737600,2,35,6.2
7682621,3,B01CE21F8M,"This was obviously a low-budget documentary; it was the sort of educational film that you might view in a high school health education class.  That said, it was well-researched and informative.",1469923200,5,193,5.225806451612903
7682622,5,B01CE21F8M,Excellent documentary. Very informative.,1469836800,3,40,9.25

7682624,1,B01CE21F8M,"I really tried to give this a chance. This is not something that anyone would choose to watch as an informational ""documentary"" - rather, it's a poorly produced piece that I imagine someone would have to view as part of their training in law enforcement or healthcare employment. The graphics and music are straight from the 1980s and the narrator speaks in a tone and speed as if the audience is in 6th grade. If you need something to fill in space on your paper on illicit drugs, go for it. Otherwise, skip this one.",1469232000,11,518,4.463157894736842
7682625,1,B01CE21F8M,this is almost as bad as the drug films they would show in detention.,1488326400,,69,4.0

7682627,5,B01CE21F8M,ok,1484870400,,2,2.0
7682628,1,B01CE21F8M,"Managed to make it 20 minutes in. Pretty much it's a poorly produced disinformation (through lack of actual research) film likely to be used to ""educate"" the completely unaware. Feels dated with -isms and ""facts"" from a 1980s Reagan era. Statistics and figures are completely unreferenced and given without appropriate contexts (e.g. is that XX million Americans or Worldwide using heroin?). Bad.",1484006400,2,396,5.403225806451613
7682629,1,B01CE21F8M,Its like one of those videos you'd watch in class on a big reel. No thanks!,1480118400,,75,3.75

7682632,1,B01CE21F8M,Awful....couldn't even bear 5 minutes of this hokey mess!,1478390400,,57,5.444444444444445
7682633,2,B01CE21F8M,"I agree with whomever it was said it looks like something you'd have to watch during an orientation, strange imagery, very repetitive,terrible music, and what is up with dancing?  the narrator sounds like a hypnotist, and if I'm not mistaken,he hails from Canada. There is one thing that I thoroughly enjoyed, his mispronounced words from morphine=more fin to heroin chic = heroin chick",1477180800,6,386,5.126984126984127

7682635,1,B01CE21F8M,"Awful......stock footage and no new information.  No idea why this film was produced, it offers nothing of any value.",1475193600,,117,5.157894736842105
7682636,1,B01CE21F8M,Terrible. Like a bad school video with 80s production value. Spews science facts at you. Shut off early,1474848000,,103,4.777777777777778
7682637,1,B01CE21F8M,too sanitized,1474588800,,13,6.0

7682641,2,B01CE21F8M,This would be a good documentary for a student learning about the dangers of doing drugs but I did not find it very interesting.,1473292800,,128,4.375
7682642,1,B01CE21F8M,Boring 1980's style.,1472860800,,20,6.0

8752800,5,B01CE21F8M,Worth waching and informative of a difficult subject.,1514851200,,53,5.75
8752801,1,B01CE21F8M,A lot of fake acting. I thought this was an actual Documentary with real stories and real cases.,1513728000,,96,4.388888888888889
8752802,2,B01CE21F8M,"This reminds me of the anti-drug films shown in school way back when I was a kid in the 80's. We just laughed at them. Hell, we were just happy for something, anything, to get out of the regular daily curriculum for an hour. The information is good but the tone of the narration is so judgy and poor--he even pronounces the word ""chic"" (""sheek"") as ""chick""-- that even as an adult I tuned it out or feel I want to suspect the information provided. We get it, ""heroin's bad, you'll die, don't do it"". It might be a good, very rudimentary, training film for potential drug counsellors but a preeteen or young adult will turn off to the message in the first 10 minutes. I CAN see it being a very effective anti-drug education film for tweens, part of very early drug education in schools before they're old enough to be cynical, but that's something not much of the general US population has historically been in favor of. For adults, it's not very educational and it certainly isn't entertaining.",1513468800,,994,4.527777777777778
8752803,1,B01CE21F8M,"The film is as dopey (pun intended!) as the old-time, 1930'soutrageous scare-fest-  REEFER MADNESS.  The creepy narrator sounds like he's too spooky and full of himself to be believed unless you're under the age of seven.  The agenda behind this corny propaganda seems to be the reason that people take drugs is that they have some kind of 'ethical flaw' and that they can't withstand the allure of drugs because they are 'morally weak' and 'socially misguided', and the solution to this problem is that we need  a more dynamic police and political posture. For god's sake, we've known this to be completely untrue for decades!!! Only view this film as a joke because that's all it is.",1513123200,,685,4.779661016949152
8752804,1,B01CE21F8M,Seriously Corporate in origin!,1509494400,,30,6.75
8752805,1,B01CE21F8M,Propaganda film. Brainwashing at its finest.,1508198400,,44,6.5
8752806,5,B01CE21F8M,Was worth the hour of it not bad at all this would be good for rehabb to watch as a video,1506384000,,89,3.2857142857142856
