8254572,5,B00147AJEK,"ENCHANTED [2007 / 2008] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] An Instant Disney Classic! The Real World and the Animated World Collide!

A fairy tale comes to life in this thoroughly original, new Disney Classic. And the sights and sounds are even more stunning on this Disney Blu-ray.

Drawing inspiration from its classic heritage, Disney creates an inspired story unlike any you have experienced before. Filled with excitement, fun and spectacular music from the legend Alan Menken, ENCHANTED is the ultimate fish-out-of-water adventure. For princess-to-be Giselle, life is a fairy tale  until she is banished from the animated land of Andalasia and thrust into the very unmagical, live-action world of modern-day Manhattan. When a cynical, no-nonsense divorce lawyer comes to her aid, little does he realise this joyful, wide-eyed innocent is about to enchant him and can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?  ENCHANTED the musical comedy that casts a more entrancing and dazzling spell in Blu-ray High Definition.  Narrated by Dame Julie Andrews.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ENCHANTED [2007] tells the story of the soon-to-be-princess Giselle, who is tricked into falling through a portal to our world. Landing in New York City, Giselle befriends a lawyer named Robert as she waits for her true love Prince Edward to find her and take her back to her home in Andalasia. Giselle must come to terms with the customs and traditions of our world and discover what love is really all about, all while evading the evil schemes of Prince Edwards mother, Queen Narissa.

ENCHANTED is essentially a spoof of the Disney canon, but also pays homage to the various movies it takes its inspiration from. This could have gone one of two ways.  Either its really entertaining and funny or it could have been awful and completely offend us fans by taking the parody side of things way too far. Thankfully, the movie is very tasteful in how it pokes fun at the classic Disney animated movies and succeeds in being very entertaining and full of humour. It takes a lot of the clichs that we see in many of the classic animated films and puts them into the real world, using this to show how silly and unpractical a lot of them are. The majority of the humour in the movie comes from both this and the other characters reacting to these things happening around them.

ENCHANTED starts off as a traditional, hand-drawn animated feature before becoming live-action when the characters enter our world. The animation is fantastic and uses a slightly different visual style than is usually found in a Disney film. The characters are more realistic looking than usual so that they are more recognisable when we see them as their live-action counterparts but still cartoony enough to make them appealing to the audience. Despite this, the film manages to capture the very essence of a Disney feel in the animation department.

ENCHANTED comes with wonderful music from the incredibly talented duo of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.  The two of whom worked together on animation films such as Pocahontas which I hate and detest and far superior and brilliant The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The songs blend with the tone of the movie and are very funny within themselves. Especially Happy Working Song which jokes around with the fact that in a lot of classic Disney films there are songs sang whilst characters are doing rather unpleasant jobs or chores, which is of course the typical essence of a Disney film.

ENCHANTED is packed full of cameos and Disney references. At numerous points during the film classic Disney music can be heard playing in the background, often when actors from those respective films are on screen. Some of those actors who make an appearance in the movie are: Jodi Benson [voice of Ariel], Judy Kuhn [singing voice of Pocahontas], Paige OHara [voice of Belle] and Dame Julie Andrews [Mary Poppins]. Youll definitely want to watch this beautiful film numerous times and see if you can find all the little nods references to other Disney films!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you this stunning 1080p encoded image. The opening animated sequence is window boxed with a black frame on all four sides to achieve a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and when we transition to the real world, the bars on the sides disappear for a full 2.35:1. The exaggerated palette of the animation gives way to a fairly accurate representation of the harsh urban jungle, which is eventually infiltrated by the rainbow hues of the big production number ""That's How You Know"" against a variety of lush greens in Central Park and the Blacks are strong and the overall image is noise-free throughout the film. Moving on to the action that takes place in our world, we are, as expected, treated to a lush, clear, and finely detailed image that excels on Blu-ray. The print, of course, is flawless, clean as a whistle, and masterfully rendered in this stunning 1080p image quality. The image is virtually free of film grain as well. Black levels are consistently excellent, reproducing an inky, exquisite look and feel that adds depth and realism to the proceedings. Fine detail is in abundance, perhaps best noticed in Prince Edward's outfit. Overall, this is a stunning image with fantastic colours, terrific depth, and high detail. It's another top-notch effort from the Disney organisation. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment presents us with a totally awesome 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio experience, which would make it a Disney's first. The audio format is a very warm, very appealing soundtrack that is sure to please Disney fans and matches the fine image frame-for-frame that is totally spellbinding. The audio fidelity is superb, as should be expected with this brand new audio sound mix. The rear soundstage is pleasantly used, surrounding the viewer in a soothing state of bliss as an animated world comes to life, engulfing the senses, especially the auditory, with fine reproduction of every note sung by a human, chirped by a bird, or played by an instrument. Bass is deep and strong, notably in an early scene involving an oversized troll. Even the little things, like heavy rain drops hitting the outside of a car while we are inside of it, sound real and engaging, surrounding us and making us feel everything but wet, as if we're right there in the car. Dialogue reproduction is uniformly excellent. It's never drowned or lost under music or effects, and sounds natural and clean. This is an active, near reference and completely enjoyable listening experience, and the sound designers of this film are to be applauded as we're seamlessly sucked into a world we know but are made to believe, at times, that we're as lost as poor Giselle, and that's just one area that makes this film so good and so much fun. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

When you get to the very end of the pop-up type trivia game challenge and you gain 290 points like I did, you have a choice of three bonus categories, if you click on the first titled category you get to see a very nice special bonus. To me this was a very enjoyable fun filed interactive pop-up type trivia game challenge, especially if you go all the way to the end of the film and well worth the effort.

Special Feature: Bloopers [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:11] Here we get to view typical light-hearted collection of a series of funny outtakes straight from the cutting room floor. But to me, some of the scenes were out right total silliness.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:05] Join director Kevin Lima as he shares a selection of scenes that did not make it into the final film release and Kevin Lima offers up a brief introduction to each scene before we see it as well as additional context before each clip is revealed. Not all of the scenes are finished, especially those that are animated and it is only pencil sketches at that, but the extended opening is very cute, and there is a nice bit with Amy Adams and James Marsden realizing that they aren't really supposed to be together. We get to view six deleted scenes, which consist of the following: A Lock Of Prince Edwards hair; Leaving Karate; I Am Not Waiting For My Prince; Hotdogs On The Bridge; Nathaniel's Revelation and Exit With A Twist. As usual, you can either play them separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Pips Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:37] Can one brave chipmunk save the Prince Edward and all of Andalasia from the evil Queen Narissa? The thrilling adventure unfolds in this all-new animated pop-up animated tale. It is also presented in high definition and backed by 5.1 audio. I can predict that A Pop-Up Adventure feature will totally enthral young children and adults alike. Narrated by Dame Julie Andrews.

Special Feature: Music Video: Ever, Ever After [Performed by Carrie Underwood] [2007] [480i] [1.37:1] [3:33] Here we have the Music Video for the song Ever, Ever After from the hit Disney film ENCHANTED, that was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz to replace a duet by actors Idina Menzel and James Marsden that was meant to take place during the beginning of the film's cartoon narrative. With this Music Video ""Ever, Ever After"" we see Carrie Underwood wandering around New York and being chased by a handsome young man, who eventually catches up with Carrie Underwood.

Trailers: When you load up the Blu-ray disc, you automatically get a selection of different Trailers, which are as follows: Walt Disney Home Entertainment Blu-ray Promotion [1080p] [1.78:1]; Sleeping Beauty  Blu-ray Platinum Edition [1080p] [2.35:1]; The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.40:1] and Underdog [Blu-ray] [1080p] [2.35:1] [7:47]

Finally, overall ENCHANTED is a great and romantic film. It is a totally lot of jolly fun and is equally very entertaining, plus there are of course as already mentioned loads of references for us Disney fans. The Disney film succeeds in capturing the essence of the Disney classic film and has a bit of fun with it too on the way. The story is simple and original, taking a tried-and-true formula and updating it for the new millennium, but with both grace and honour, harkening back to the typical Disney classics in a respectful manner, but also making fun of them along the way. Everything about this Blu-ray disc, especially this Disney film, the video, the sound, and the supplements is totally perfect. Each one is fascinating and exciting, and together makes for one heck of a Blu-ray package and I know most audience members will find something to love about all aspect of this magical Disney film, like I did and by the time the film ends you will be definitely humming and singing those magical songs for some time to come, as Alan Menken (composer/lyricist) and Stephen Schwartz (lyricist) have done a superb and sterling job all round. Highly Recommended!
