8305130,5,B00029CXOU,"I bought this DVD blindly, HOPING there would be footage of the original group of Brotherhood Of Man on it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out there IS!! All footage on this DVD is of best quality available, and even on the clips of the ""second"" version of the group, if you like them. But the real gems are the full length performances of the original lineup. These 3 performances are as follows (all are sung live, no lip synch):

1. United We Stand- Top Of The Pops (Black and White) January 28, 1970 (Sunny Leslie, Sue Glover, Johnny Goodison, Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway)

2. California Sunday Morning- UNICEF 25th Anniversary Special (Color) November 11, 1971 (Sunny Leslie, Sue Glover, Johnny Goodison, Tony Burrows)

3. Proud Mary- UNICEF 25th Anniversary Special (Color) November 11, 1971 (Sunny Leslie, Sue Glover, Johnny Goodison, Tony Burrows)",1168214400,4,865,4.951724137931034
