7508199,5,B017N7UQE2,"It baffles me that Disney does not make Fantasia more widely available to (US) consumers, particularly music educators like me for whom this is an invaluable resource. Fortunately, Region 1 compatible versions exist and I am VERY pleased to have this in my resource library (even if it required buying an external Blu-Ray drive).",1482624000,3,329,5.111111111111111
8739818,5,B017N7UQE2,"Of all the video and audio releases of this masterpiece, this is the one to own. Not only one of the greatest art films ever made, it was also a technical achievement in audio never experienced by movie audiences before. Before the transistor and audio tape, the Disney invention of Fantasound gave movie goers their first experience of multi-channel surround sound, all recorded and reproduced from optical (film) tracks. That, along with its dazzling use of Technicolor, was so unlike anything ever experienced it left audiences stunned and the studio almost bankrupt. It wasn't until the mid 1960s the film turned a profit. It would take another 60 years before the original idea of a film that would continuously evolve was realized with Fantasia 2000. Pressured by the Disney animators and his brother Roy, Walt was reluctant to put so many resources into the original. It is of great benefit to the history of film that Walt gave it the green light. If any of this sparks additional interest in the history of Fantasia, Technicolor and Fantasound, as I hope it does, Uncle Google is your friend and teacher. Id love to drop some links here, but don't think it is allowed.",1534809600,,1177,4.8316831683168315

8739820,1,B017N7UQE2,I don't remember it being 30+ minutes of photos and an orchestra conductor in the beginning. Is this right? Where is all the other stuff? Seems there should be a theatrical but this is just the same music playing over and over with a photo slide of images. Not as I remembered Fantasia but its been a while since Ive seen it. However I don't think its the original so Im returning!,1513123200,,381,4.305555555555555
