8181669,5,B000NVHWJS,"I  found both the Vertical Abs and the Slow and Steady workouts  to be excellent..I've done a lot of exercises, including those from various ""senior sites"" as well as things given to me from physical therapy.  These two workouts ""organize"" me in a consistent manner. You don't rush the exercises so I find I'm getting a lot of benefit out of this.
I have been doing Fit for Fifty and other floor and ab work, but the chair ""bicycle"" I hadn't done before and it really does work those lower abs.  In 2 or three session my strength improved so much that the exercise has become enjoyable....the first time was really tough!

After doing the Vertical Abs and S & S, I feel absolutely great!

I haven't tried the Vertical Fat-Zapping workout yet, because I've also been trying her ""Interval Aerobic"" DVD...I have an injured foot and was able to do it, but I'm going to lay low awhile.  The stretching on that tape is phenomenal, by the way...

I'm nearly 66 and Joyce is an inspiration...and I'm at high school weight and sticking with Joyce!",1479168000,4,1038,4.543010752688172

8181671,5,B000NVHWJS,I use this program and use much heavier weights than a beginner would as I have exercised for years but I think this is suitable for beginners and also the stomach exercises are done standing as is the rest of the workout which is great for people who have a hard time getting up and down off the floor.  Also you can use no weights or light weights or like me heavy weights.  I don't do the stomach exercises as they are not effective for me as I am advanced and have rock hard abs but I do recommend this for people just starting out to lay a good foundation for her other programs.  This is a good program and recommended.,1326326400,7,625,4.148760330578512
8181672,4,B000NVHWJS,"This workout comes in 3 parts; an abs workout, a slow movement whole body workout and a ""fat-zapping"" workout. They share the feature that no mat work is involved. So you do this standing up or sitting in a chair. If you prefer not to work out on the floor, then this is an option as it could be difficult to get up and down off the floor, don't laugh, it's not easy after ""a certain age."" Also, certain ab exercises are hard on weak bones (rolling on your back, for example.) If any of this applies to you, check with your physician if this workout could be a good one for your fitness.

The abs are done slowly, using dynamic tension; in other words, you should try to make the movement slow and deliberate, even resisting the movement. This is not well-explained in the workouts themselves, but it is the principle behind this kind of workout. As you resist your own muscle movement, you build strength. I did the abs workout; it was not difficult, then followed with the fat-zapping workout. This is done with a single weight, a light one, and it also involved super-sets, meaning you work similar groups of muscles or the same group in different ways. This gets you tired.

While I did not find this a difficult workout at all, afterwards, I was fatigued but relaxed. It really felt good.  You can modify these workouts in many ways: do all three, do one, but add weights and repeat, or any variation. As you progress, you can find different ways to mix it up so your body isn't used to the same workout.

As a DVD standalone, it is good for travelers, as a single weight, even water bottles, and a chair is all you need. That's pretty good. However, this workout shines as a change-up if you have other workouts such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-On-The-Ball-Workout/dp/B002AUIFAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: On The Ball Workout</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown-Plus-Stomach-Zapping-Abs/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown Plus Stomach Zapping Abs</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bone-Building-Body-Shaping-Workout-Strength-Health-Beauty-In-Just-16-Minutes-A-Day/dp/0684847310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bone Building Body Shaping Workout: Strength Health Beauty In Just 16 Minutes A Day</a>. In fact, Dr. Vedral couples this workout with ""Definition"" and ""Slow Duet"" to create a body-shock. ""Definition"" is a standard, pyramid set workout with weights (she uses dumbbells, but it can be nicely adapted to weight machines) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Slow-Duet/dp/B002AUIFAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Slow Duet  </a>&nbsp;is also a slow, dynamic resistance workout with light weights. If you get bored, this is a nice workout to change off from time to time. If you are super-fit, it will possibly seem too easy. If you are out of shape, you probably can do this right off the bat, so it's not impossibly hard for the beginner.

Because you can adapt this and make it more difficult, I recommend this DVD for beginners, travelers who want in-hotel-room fitness possibilities, or for anyone who wants a quick workout that can be made effective depending on how you mix it up. I like it.",1288742400,12,3444,5.823412698412699
8181673,2,B000NVHWJS,"I am a big fan of Joyce Vedral's book series.  I have, at one time or another, owned all of them.  I bought this DVD thinking it would be equal or better than the books..I was so disappointed.  This DVD was just not my cup of tea at all.
I thought it was boring, poorly produced, too much lag time in between exercises, not well cued...just not a great exercise DVD at all for me.
I really wish I liked it more because her books are great!",1248220800,7,439,4.022988505747127
8181674,2,B000NVHWJS,I bought this DVD for a vertical ab workout.  There are exactly three exercises in this regard.  This DVD was a big disappointment.,1231718400,7,131,4.6521739130434785
