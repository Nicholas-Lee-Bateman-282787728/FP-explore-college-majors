7899195,4,630594833X,"Two episodes, one from each of the show's first two seasons, highlight the excellence of the show's writing as well as of the cast.
Elsewhen largely eschews SFX footage - only one shot of the outsized allosaur Big Alice is seen - and instead focuses on Holly Marshall (Kathleen Coleman) as she finds a dimensional doorway, in which is a lovely adult woman, named Ronnie (Erica Hagan, who last appeared as Holly's mother in Album).  Ronnie offers Holly advise on helping Rick and Will, but Holly is perplexed as to who she is, until at the end she discovers, and realizes that she and her family will survive regardless of what transpires in the future.
Split Personality is a more FX driven episode, as tremors throughout the land split a valley floor and briefly trap the resident tyrannosaur Grumpy - the scene of Grumpy plunging into the earth is genuinely unsettling, and likely a follow-up scene of Grumpy climbing out unscathed was forced to reassure the youthful audience (and placate Standards and Practices at NBC).
Rick and Will try to find out the source of the tremors, and to their surprise come upon themselves, trapped in a cave wall, their frozen dopplegangers bearing energy crystals that hold the key to righting what has gone wrong.",987033600,3,1251,4.818604651162791
7899196,5,630594833X,"Land of the Lost is by far one of the best children's shows ever made and captures Sid and Marty Croft's talent at their creative best. This was a  true 70's classic enjoyed by both children and adults as well. This show  combined just the right amount of action, adventure, drama, and humor and  was loaded with some pretty cool sets, costumes, and special effects for a  early 70's childrens' show. The episodes from the first two seasons were  very imaginative and well done. These two episodes were part of the first,  and by far the best, season of this show. ""Elsewhen"" is easily  one of the most interesting Land of the Lost episodes, with some wild plot  twists and some relatively scary situations that scared the hell out of me  when I was a child. The sleestak episodes were my favorites and this one  certainly has plenty of Sleestaks. ""Split Personality"" is a  pretty wild episode as well, with some bizzarre special effects. If you are  a fan of this show then you will definitely like these two episodes. They  are among the finest that were made. I'm glad to see that Rhino is  re-releasing these classic episodes on home video and look forward to  additional episodes being released in the future.",965260800,4,1214,4.633802816901408
