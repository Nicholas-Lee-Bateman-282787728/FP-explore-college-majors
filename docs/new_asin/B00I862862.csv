8639742,4,B00I862862,"I am happy to report I had no issues with play back such as pixelating, skips, freezes, etc. which seem to plague a lot of VEI's older titles.  I did however notice a few more artifacts in the picture than were seen in Season 1-3.  At times there were fairly large scratches in the film which registered as green lines in the picture.  I also noticed at times the frame size would seem to change very slightly right in the middle of a scene almost as though it was zoomed in or out very slightly (not sure if it has something to do with the way VEI edited the tapes?).  These issues were not that distracting, just a little annoying.  I was though impressed overall with the picture quality, I doubt it was re-mastered but the colors looked very bright and vivid on my HDTV (pretty much as nice as Season 1-3 just with more artifacts than I remember from the earlier Seasons).  I also enjoyed the stories a lot as the writing for this series remained very good  I have one Season left and I hope it plays perfectly too.  At least I can still replace defective discs for now but Season 4 appears to be OOP as of right now.",1487462400,,1121,4.254716981132075
