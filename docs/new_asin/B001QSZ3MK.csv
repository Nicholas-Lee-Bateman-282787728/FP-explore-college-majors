I love that this has sun salutations and shavasana, and many of the yoga poses used are the ones I use in my class. I also love that she has a great 30 minute session that leaves me feeling great afterward.",1421625600,,329,4.15625
8336240,3,B001QSZ3MK,"This is not all standing by any means which disappointed me a bit. The standing parts are good though. The instructor, Nicki Doane, is tough but personable and the exercises and moves can be a real challenge. I found myself asking if she thought I was a contortionist more than once while first attempting to do the moves. There is a mat workout that I didn't want which cut into the standing time. I enjoyed this but like other standing Pilates and Yoga DVDs better.",1410739200,,467,4.5058823529411764
8336241,5,B001QSZ3MK,"Good DVD - same poses that the gym instructor uses and now free. Save the cost of a gym, gas to travel and time. With this DVD you can exercise at any time of day and get the same resist!",1385251200,2,187,3.7
8336242,5,B001QSZ3MK,"I've practiced yoga on and off for 10 years.  While I am not advanced, I wouldn't say that I am a beginner either.  Too often I find DVDs that are too short and too easy or way beyond my abilities.  Doane's Standing Flow Series is just right!  I definitely struggle to do the 45 minute practice as well as I would like.  Still, it feels like success is attainable.  Both the short and long practice are centered around sun salutations.  Some might find that repetitive but I feel that, for me, growth in yoga is dependent upon a solid foundation.  I enjoy sun salutations and already feel stronger and more flexible which has noticeably improved my ability to hold other poses not part of this workout including the Crow.

Doane has a very calm aura about her which I also enjoy. She talks no more than necessary but enough to ensure that you remain thoughtful about your breathe and practice.",1378684800,3,893,4.53125
8336243,5,B001QSZ3MK,"balanced strength & stretch, very doable but still challenging. like the 45 min session the best. production quality good, like everything about this dvd. the 3 sessions are all different, and not shortened, edited versions of each other.",1359158400,3,238,5.2894736842105265
8336244,5,B001QSZ3MK,I searched and searched for a yoga workout that wasn't 'commercial'.  Now days everyone has a yoga dvd out and many of them left me very disappointed.  Thankfully Nicki Doane did not disappoint.  I truly love this workout and I cannot wait to purchase her Bending Back Flow.,1339027200,3,274,4.666666666666667
8336245,5,B001QSZ3MK,Nicki Doane is always informative and very patient when it comes to teaching yoga. I give my hat off to her. I love this DVD very much. I work out to it on a regular basis. This yoga workout DVD can not be compared to other ones. This is just different. Peace.,1257206400,7,260,4.019230769230769
