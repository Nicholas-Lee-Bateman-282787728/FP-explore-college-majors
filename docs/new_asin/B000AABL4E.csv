2383653,5,B000AABL4E,"It is a very-good chronologic narration of the entire war. It also does a good job relating the war to ongoing political issues. If you want to know what was all about, this is it.  In the down side, the footage is of poor quality, especially in the first chapter.",1235347200,2,264,4.28
2383654,3,B000AABL4E,"I watched this documentary with high hopes. While the information was good, it was a fairly bland documentary. There was a lot of old war footage and some cheesy music to go along with that. The narration was alright too. There really just wasn't anything about this documentary that excited me. It was looked like the documentary was made at least 10-15 years ago, so that didn't help it out either.
I give it a thumbs up for having decent and accurate information, but a thumbs down for watchability.",1235088000,10,502,4.651685393258427

2383656,3,B000AABL4E,"KOREA: THE FORGOTTEN WAR was a TV documentary that originally aired in 1987. Hosted by Robert Stack and running just over 90 minutes total, it's a terse outline of an ultimately futile struggle that was once called a ""police action.""

When progress was made by U.N. forces (they'd fought their way well into the North), China sent in personnel and weaponry and turned the tide of battle. A retreat ensued and after a lengthy standoff, hostilities eventually ended along the 38th parallel, which is generally where had they begun three years earlier. In the end, little was gained, tens of thousands of Americans were killed, more wounded and a massive number of Koreans also perished. The stand-off created by peace negotiations remains in effect 55 years later.

This was the first war Americans waged without victory; results here were an augur for the future. The men who fought never received the same honors that our WWII vets did, and the Korean War remains for many an intentionally forgotten conflict.

A word on the actual program:
The given 3 star rating is based solely on style. Stack as narrator is quite good. Each segment between ad breaks has a chapter heading-- another plus. Where the program falls short however is in an overly loud music track and the producer's decision to constantly rapid cut between film clips shortened to barely a handful of seconds each. These jarring edits ruin narrative continuity and leave the viewer a bit annoyed.

2383658,4,B000AABL4E,"I have been fascinated with the Korean War since a grade schooler in the early 60's.  I spent three seperate one year tours in South Korea in the 70's and 80's while in the U.S. Army, and toured some of the battlefields while there.
I purchased this in 1987 on VHS and really enjoyed it then.  But, it does lack punch. There are no interviews of surviving veterans on either side.  The work only covers the most basic points of the war and never goes into some of the more controversial incidents. (1). The brutality of the Rhee regime (Who the U.S. supported). (2). The poor performance of the U.S. Army combat units (3). The collaboration of U.S. POWs with their communist captors (which resulted in the Code of Conduct).  (4).  Why such a modern military force as the U.N., with all it's fire power, was forced to retreat from a bunch of ""pajama clad"" Chinese, who had no  heavy artillery or air support. But, as always Robert Stack is an excellent narrator, and the war is presented in chronological order with decent (somewhat grainy) black and white footage.
The DVD is only 100 minutes long, so they did what they could in that amount of time.
There is so much more to that war than is covered here.  For some good reading Donald Knox and Max Hastings both wrote excellent books. I give this DVD 3 1/2 stars.",1201478400,57,1315,4.476987447698745

Names, places, dates and actions are talked about but other than that, not much is discussed. Again, it is highly recommended if you know little or nothing about the Korean war.",1269734400,3,432,4.697368421052632

8077022,5,B000AABL4E,"I freely confess that I love Robert Stack's voice.  He had one of the greatest voices in movies and TV.  So to be totally honest, the main reason I bought this video is that voice.  However, this is a compelling account of what has truly become the forgotten war.  It never was characterized as a ""war"" while it was going on; it was always referred to as a ""police action"" in the media in the 1950s, when I was growing up.  It is only in recent decades that officialdom and the media have admitted that, yes, it was a war.  I never have been able to decide whether the Korean War was worth the cost.  On the one hand, there is the chilling and bizarre presence of North Korea, an Orwellian society ruled by madmen.  On the other, the loss of lives was immense, yet nothing was resolved.  South Korea's democracy was preserved, but the specter of North Korea still is there.  The footage in this documentary is sometimes disturbing, even upsetting.  The courage of the soldiers was immense, the conditions under which they lived sometimes horrific.  I am disappointed in the History Channel for a lot of things these days.  They air much that has nothing really to do with history.  This time, however, they got it right.",1409443200,3,1220,4.511415525114155
8077023,5,B000AABL4E,"Excellent book on Korea, that everyone should read.if interested in on of the greatest come backs from the ""Frozen Chosin""",1401321600,,122,5.15
8077024,2,B000AABL4E,"This DVD started with war footage.  Then there was a very brief attempt at the history of Korea.  Then the war footage continued.  What was Korea like before the war?  I don't know.  I just know that the Commies came from the north, and the USA came from the South, and there was a war in Korea.  Disappointing.

The footage is black-and-white, but mostly washed-out white, which makes it difficult to watch.

The sound/narration starts-out muffled, but it got better quickly.

The narrator was professional, and the narration was somewhat informative.  However, for the most part, the narration did not match the footage.  Most of the time, the footage was random, short war clips strung together.  What was actually happening in the footage?  I don't know.  The narrator just kept telling the Korean War story without regard to the footage itself.  The footage of Inchon seemed to match the narration, but that was not the norm for this documentary.

I am still looking for a well-round documentary about the Korean War.  I had the same problem while looking for a decent documentary about the Vietnam War, but I eventually found this excellent documentary:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vietnam-A-Television-History/dp/B0001WTWOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vietnam - A Television History</a>.  Maybe there is something like it for the Korean War, but I haven't found it yet.

UPDATE 6/29/15
I found a well-round Korean War documentary; here it is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korea-The-Forgotten-War-4-DVD-Set/dp/B003EYEEI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korea The Forgotten War - 4 DVD Set</a>.
