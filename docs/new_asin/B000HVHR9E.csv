I discovered Los Romeros while studying music in college. I was skeptical about the guitar vs classical music on one hand but on the other I remember the great living traditions of great guitar makers and music from a visit to Spain while in the U.S. Navy. I sat in the front row of the concert hall to better see and hear the original quartet. The concert opened with the playing of the two national anthems - U.S.A. and Spain. Hearing the Spanish national anthem played by a magnicent orchestra brought tears to my eyes because I played that same music as a lead trumpet player in a U.S. Navy Band.

From the instant I heard Los Romeros play I was convinced of their great talent and the importance of sharing their heritage and music with the world. In a society mesmorized by popular music and very loud electric guitars the warm gentle sound produced by Los Romeros is all the more striking. All I can add is please support this fantastic tradition!",1258934400,4,1022,4.430851063829787
8141540,3,B000HVHR9E,"They all play acoustic box guitars more less in the style of their patriarch; they are called the ""Royal Family of the Guitar"".
One brother, Angel Romero, conducts with the San Diego orchestra who has had his individual concert career.
Four part harmony allows fugues of a Bach type of high complexity and rich sound. As a music lover I could wish that they used guitars of a higher and lower tonal range. The music of a classical type that lends itself to guitar is somewhat limited so they also compose and arrange music to fit
their band style.
I liked some of the music, but thought that they aren't really very open to new ideas in music?",1244246400,2,643,4.4576271186440675
8141541,5,B000HVHR9E,"The Royal Family of the Spanish Guitar indeed, what else do I have to say? They are definately not called the Royal Family of the Spanish Guitar for nothing. This DVD includes a detailed history of the legendary Celedonio Romero and how the quartet came about. In this video, it also includes the composition of Celedonio Romero himself, Malaguena and Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto Andaluz. In my opinion, it is definately not easy to create a family of guitarists spanning 3 generations. Now that the patriach had passed away, the 3 sons, Celin, Pepe and Angel continues the legacy that Celedonio started. The two wonderful grandsons of Celedonio's, Celino and Lito, forming the new quartet. This DVD is definately a must for those who love Classical Music and the Spanish Guitar. A great inspiration I would say!",1232755200,9,812,4.977941176470588
