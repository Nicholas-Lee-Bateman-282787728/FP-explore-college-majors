8252683,3,B0013QYBBE,What ever company produced this dvd kinda did a crappy job. The whole picture is blurry. You would be better off watching the VHS for clarity. However it was fun to go back down memory lane.,1368489600,,190,4.305555555555555
8252684,4,B0013QYBBE,"The DVD works great! The only thing was the actual videos say Starla and not Gwenevere. A small more sentimental issue than anything else, but it brought back lots of good memories. Worth it.",1351468800,,191,4.647058823529412
8252685,5,B0013QYBBE,"It was a great shows I haven't seen a long time.

8252686,5,B0013QYBBE,It is interesting that that while the cover title follows the America show title the episodes are actually The British version from what I hear in which Gwenevere's name is replace both in episode and opening credits with the name Starla.  Not sure if the British had something against Gwenevere since that the name from their King Arthur legends or not. It contains the first five episodes of the series from Digiview and would of been nice if they had continued their releases. The picture quality looks like it been recorded off TV instead of digitally remastered but it still wonderful to watch.,1242086400,7,599,4.815533980582524
