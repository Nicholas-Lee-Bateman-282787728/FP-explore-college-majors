4640953,5,B005AIHXKW,"I am a yoga teacher, and I have had a consistent home practice for many years, having collected a wide range of yoga dvds, books and music.  My first experience of Janet Stone yoga was through her first two videos RADIANT and MELLOW FLOW, which I turn to again and again for my own practice and for her beautiful flowing sequences which I use again and again in my own classes.  I simply have loved and enjoyed them each time I use them.  When I received word that she had produced three more videos, I immediately purchased them, knowing that the content, sequencing and yoga philosphy contained in the videos would be first rate.  These videos did not disappoint.  It simply does not get any better than this in yoga dvds.  Janet is a wonderful, humble guide, always providing modifications to suit all practitioners.  She weaves in yoga philosophy during the practice in a simple, inspiring way----everything coming together in one beautiful flow!  Where ever you are in your yoga journey, I assure you, you will love these videos and turn to them over and over again for your home practice.  Thank you Janet!",1311033600,,1112,4.690721649484536
4640954,5,B005AIHXKW,"This is a slower vinyasa than the ananda DVD but it is still challenging. The focus here is hip opening and it gets the job done. It starts lying down with some core work and moves on to some fluid vinyasas, I really liked a vinyasa that included some cobra variation, locust and then sliding back to camel pose. I was glad to see  side plank variation and Eka Pada Koundiyanasana II in this practice also because I love to work on my arm balancing. I remember a series of kneeling poses like gate pose and a variation of warrior 2. One of the last poses is pigeon with a variation of grabbing your back leg. The music and production are awesome. I really felt open in my hips after this practice and I would recommend it to advanced beginners, as long as they do the easier variations, otherwise I see it as suitable for intermediates.",1310860800,12,836,4.358974358974359
4640955,5,B005AIHXKW,"I am thrilled with this routine!  Janet has such a gift!  Not only is she unbelievable in her poses, but she takes the spiritual and meditative aspect of her flow to the next level!  I absolutely love the peace I feel once I finish the routine!",1322265600,,244,4.260869565217392
4640956,5,B005AIHXKW,"This is a very special DVD. In terms of commentary, this is by far the most moving yoga DVD I have found.  Janet is mature, and her commentary is full of Yogic philosophy, which resonates with depth and a push for personal growth. In fact, was actually moved to tears the first time I did the disc. I think it was the combination of the commentary and the profound hip opening. It's not that I had pushed myself beyond my edge in the hip opening, but rather I somehow had reached a place that I hadn't before, opening up a channel of energy that was until now untouched. And with Janet pressing me just to accept what is...something released, sunk in. Perhaps it was a barrier to my own self acceptance.

The workout itself was not all that physically challening for me, in an aerobic sense.  There are no Warrior 1, 2, or 3 asanas or even a single upward dog pose on this DVD! No sholder stands, no upward facing bow, no half moon, and no directed abdominal work! She does have an interesting warrior 2 like pose which is done on one knee though. There are a lot of lunge variations, cobra, and shalabasanas. She has an interesting and original progressive flow from lunge to camel pose, which is done repeatedly. Janet has a lot of creativity with the poses, and she takes poses that I know and alters them, combining them in an interesting sequence that is, to me, truly new. She will take a pose that Shiva Rea innovated, and she will alter it, improve it, deepen it.

Janet found a very talented stylist for the screen set. The mood is eerie and mystical. The Easten music is quite interesting.  There is only one tune that was on Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti.

I look forward to doing this disc again, to opening up the layers of Janet's commentary, to giving up my own drive to achieve and progress, and instead--to get closer to the place of being. However my only regret is that the workout is a bit too light--it leaves out that aerobic element that would make this DVD truly and fully satisfying. Unfortunately, it comes just short of that.",1320278400,,2046,4.442666666666667
4640957,5,B005AIHXKW,"Sometimes I don't know what I'm missing until I find it.  Now that I've seen Janet Stone's Ganesha Flow, I feel like I've wanted this DVD for years!  The yoga sequences are even more gorgeous than the first-rate production.  Now that I've practiced with this DVD a few times, I can say that it stands up to repeated viewings.  I find more openness, more fullness, and more energy each time.  I look forward to practicing these sequences again and again for some time to come.

Janet's verbal cues - for movement as well as breath - are full of wisdom.  They're intelligent and deep, which is essential considering I'll be listening to them a lot.  Her suggestions help me to make subtle adjustments that will benefit my entire yoga practice, not just one particular pose on one particular day.

As one of Janet's students, I wasn't sure how a DVD would measure up in comparison to being in her classes.  But as I now know, in any medium, she's a powerful teacher.  She delivers.  She's awesome.

Oh, and by the way, she's FUN!!!  And now I can practice with Janet whenever I want to :)",1318982400,6,1085,4.4974358974358974
4640958,5,B005AIHXKW,"LOVE this DVD!!! Janet's amazing at easing into it and creating an invigorating heat.  Every cell in my body and brain feels awakened and energized.  This a slow but challenging sequence (my favourite).  Janet's flawless and smooth.  You can see her experience, heart and humbleness with every move she does.  A must for everyone's yoga library.",1317600000,,345,5.089285714285714
4640959,5,B005AIHXKW,"As a yoga teacher and a devoted practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to practice with many amazing teachers from all around the world. Similarly, over the years I have watched literally every single yoga DVD I could get my hands on, always looking for the same three qualities I look for in a teacher: passion, innovation, and artistry. No one embodies these qualities quite like Janet Stone.

Janet Stone is a wonder; truly one of the most radiant and inspiring teachers I have ever known. Passion? She has it and then some. Her love for yoga, and the joy that sharing the practice bring her is self-evident. Innovation? Absolutely. Janet's sequences are some of the most innovative and exciting I have ever experienced. Artistry? No question. Just watching Janet flow from pose to pose is revelatory. Join her and you begin to create art yourself in collaboration with her golden voice and superb soundtrack.

This DVD exudes all of these qualities before you even press play, as the production quality of the packaging and disc pressing is first class in every respect. Everything you experience once the video is rolling is similarly phenomenal, from the menus to the soundtrack to the words of wisdom and meditation that permeate the practice. A bargain at any price. You deserve this practice.",1316563200,,1305,4.927272727272728
4640960,5,B005AIHXKW,"Janet Stone's offering is simply the best: deeply rooted in tradition and experience; innovative and fun; healing and strengthening for the body and soul. On top of the actual yoga, the beauty of the video production provides a complete experience for the home practitioner.  Living in San Francisco I get the Janet experience in person regularly, and I regularly pay upwards of $20 to do so.  That makes these videos a bargain that you can't go wrong with. Thank you Janet!",1316390400,,474,4.839506172839506
4640961,5,B005AIHXKW,"These are the DVD chapters:

Invocation (4:30):  A quiet, seated meditation

Earth Foundation (9:13): Starts with core work - table pose (including long holds), Navasana (boat pose-knees bent), yoga roll-up with bent knees, and something similar to pilates rolling-like-a-ball, before rolling into Malasana.  The next portion is standing poses: skier's squat with arm movements, and Uttanasana (forward bend) gently swaying back and forth. From Uttanasana she does whole body circles with arms folded over the head before rolling up to standing. She then moves to chair pose with hands resting on the knees doing a series of gentle spine movements - forward/back, and then circles. She closes this section with chair pose, extending to mountain pose, and then chair pose sweeping arms forward and back, and ends with Uttanasana.

Hello Hips (11:48):  Begins with low lunges alternating with Uttanasana (forward bend) and then downward dog with leg variations.  Next is plank pulling back into downward dog, followed by a backbend sequence - cobra (including twists), locust, camel, and downward dog. Chair pose is next (including twists). She then returns to the previous sequence: low lunge, downward dog with leg variations, and three times through the backbend movement. She closes with an extended child pose and then slow hip circles on all fours.

Lunge for Love (5:56): This sequence starts with downward dog to low lunge, half splits, plank, cobra, camel - repeating sequence on other side.  She then goes into a mandala (circular flow) going from low lunge at the top of the mat, passing quickly through wide leg squat (Goddess) facing away, low lunge at the bottom of the mat, Goddess again facing away, and then returning to low lunge at the top of the mat.  She does this several times then goes into a transition sequence of downward dog, forward to plank, cobra, camel, back to downward dog. She then completes the mandala by repeating the low lunge/quick Goddess combo except this time she faces towards the screen when passing through the squat. This sequence ends by repeating the transition sequence, and then child's pose.

(interesting note, Slow and Low and Earth to Sky appear to be reversed on the menu)

From Earth to Sky (5:49): Starts with a long Anahatasana. Moves to downward dog to plank, before she moves into a supported Ardha Shalabhasana (locust - with one leg raised, and the other leg used for support), repeating on the other side.  Next she goes to downward dog with raised leg, to low lunge and then pulls up to pyramid pose, repeating low lunge/pyramid three times, and then to triangle pose.  She has a transition sequence of downward dog, plank, cobra, camel, to downward dog - and then repeats the low lunge/pyramid/triangle pose sequence on the other side, and the transition sequence.

Slow and Low (13:01): This section includes Uttanasana, downward dog, low lunge and then grab back foot to stretch, half warrior 2, gate pose, Vasisthasana variations, low lunge variation as prep, Eka Pada Koundiyanasana, and downward dog.  There is a pause in the flow with child's pose, and then rolling to a wide leg kneeling position while gently undulating the spine. She then starts the sequence over beginning with downward dog/low lunge on the other side.

Metta (loving-kindness) (7:34): Long stretches in this segment with variations on low lunge and pigeon pose.

Landing (8:14): Lotus/half lotus (sit on a blanket if you need) - she includes a move where you roll up over your knees, hips dropping forward, stretching forward.  Then shaking out the legs, dandasana to seated forward bend, and then just sitting quietly with knees bent and head resting on knees. Moves to happy baby, supine spinal twist, and supine bound angle.

Savasana and Offering (4:37)

My thoughts:  I loved this DVD.  The pace was perfect, and she slows at just the right spots throughout the flow.  I think of this as more of an intermediate yoga practice, although as Yoni mentions I think an experienced beginner could do this as well.  There are a couple advanced poses, but they are completely optional.  Thanks to Deana for introducing me to Janet.  Can't wait to try Ananda Vinyasa next!",1314489600,26,4210,5.020143884892087
4640962,5,B005AIHXKW,Janet Stone inspires the viewer to flow! She is brilliant to watch and marvelous to hear! This DVD is a MUST for yogis everywhere!,1314144000,,130,4.458333333333333
4640963,5,B005AIHXKW,"If I were stranded on a deserted island or under house arrest, and I could only have three items, I'd want pens & paper, books, and this DVD. Janet Stone is simply the best yoga teacher I've ever encountered. Her sequencing, heart, knowledge, and dedication to this practice is remarkable. If you are into getting your yoga fix at home, this is the way to go.",1313625600,3,359,4.454545454545454
4640964,5,B005AIHXKW,"Ganesha Flow is a beautiful and unique practice. You begin by sitting on the mat in easy seat listening to Janet and meditating, and from there you move into a lovely, flowing, vinyasa sequence. By the time I was finished I was soaked and blissful. Most of this workout is spent on the mat either on all fours, downward dog or seated, so I think it's slightly easier than the companion workout of Ananda Flow. For reference, I consider myself an advanced exerciser and do yoga exclusively. I will begin yoga teacher training soon and find this dvd is helping me gain strength and flexibility while focusing my mind.",1312588800,,615,4.651376146788991
8463294,5,B005AIHXKW,Prompt delivery!  Love Janet Stone!,1510358400,,35,6.0
8463295,4,B005AIHXKW,this is my first j. stone dvd. on the box it says for beginner to intermediate. it might be difficult for a beginner bc she gives few commentary on proper alignment. the poses n sequence are interesting n create alot of heat.  many reviews said hard on knees and i can see where people may experience that as beginners. she doesnt que to move forward vs putting weight directly on patellar ( knee cap) nor does she offer the option to just use your strength of back leg n avoid knee all together. in summary i would say to do this video when your looking to get a flexibility n creative practice in. afterwards u won't feel the joint stability and strength one might feel after a power yoga class. but you will feel like gumby!!! .  i plan to buy more dvd from j stone. ohhh one thing to consider- she is extremely india love n light blah blah blah so if your adverse to that style then u might get annoyed in beginning!,1384041600,,920,4.251428571428572
8463296,5,B005AIHXKW,I wanted to have something where I believed that the instructor is true in their practice.  In addition to the physical experience I use yoga as a tool to breathe as well as calm my mind.  This is the best I have found outside of going to an actual class.  In some cases it may even be better.  I have recently purchased her first 2 dvd's from her site directly where there is a 2 for 1 special.  I look forward to them.  I have found that I am sore in the shoulder upper back area some when I use this routine. I love it either way.,1375747200,,533,3.9345794392523366
8463297,4,B005AIHXKW,"This was my first Janet Stone yoga video, and I must say that she has succeeded in making me understand why she has so many followers.

There's a nice pace here, as she takes you through a series of traditional vinyasa poses combined with her own take on some of these. I found the new poses both fun and appropriately challenging. Plus, there's lots of work here on the hips, which is one of my tightest areas. I definitely feel more open in my hips immediately after doing this routine and also the following day.

I'm probably at the low-intermediate level now, which means there are still some advanced poses that I can't do. But fortunately, Janet is one of those select few instructors who is wise enough to recognize that she has to aim her program toward students at all levels. And so I find that I am more or less able to do everything in this video--to a certain level, of course. And that's nice.

However, I will add one caveat: this program can add strain on your knees. I don't actually have knee problems, or I haven't for years. But the first time I did this, my knees were really sore the next day. The same thing happened the second time.

In fact, I noticed one other reviewer wrote a review entitled ""Hard on the Knees,"" and I have to agree with everything she said. That is the reason I gave this video four stars and not five. If you have knee issues, avoid this video and find something that does not put strain in that area.

Overall, this is a diverse and fun routine that, were it not for the knee strain issue, would be one of my very top yoga videos.",1374278400,,1579,4.320945945945946
8463298,3,B005AIHXKW,"I adore Janet Stone and have given 5 star reviews to two of her other DVD's that I own.  This one is just too hard on my knees. It seems like more than half of this sequence puts direct pressure on them.  I should mention that one of my knees was reconstructed after a ski injury several years back. People with healthy knees probably don't have the same complaint. Some suggested alternative poses would have been helpful, but I was disappointed that none were shown. Since it should be just fine for others, I'll gift it to a friend so it gets some proper love.",1340928000,10,563,4.352380952380952
8463299,4,B005AIHXKW,"I am a yoga beginner and most of the yoga I have tried is what I guess you would call ""modern"".  Janet Stone's practice seems to be a good blend of modern and traditional yoga.  Overall, I enjoy the workout and the challenge.  I will certainly purchase her other tapes when my yoga has improved past ""beginner"".",1336608000,,311,4.421052631578948
8463300,3,B005AIHXKW,"I like Janet's voice and demeanor very much, but I am just not a fan of downdog vinyasa over and over. I am a yoga instructor, and I love more variety and creativity in a flow than this. Janet seems to be a competent instructor.  If she would slow down a little, add more asanas and less vinyasa repetition this DVD would be exceptional.  Overall disappointed.",1330992000,8,360,4.4393939393939394
8463301,5,B005AIHXKW,"If there is a formula for world peace, it involves everyone starting their day with this DVD. I have been practicing yoga for 7 years and this is the best practice I've seen either on DVD or in studio.
Janet Stone is a remarkable teacher, and this is her most inspiring DVD. The sequence, scenery, and music are delicious. Janet's instruction is flawless. Her cuing is not overly detailed but clear and easy to follow. The practice is unique and unlike anything you will see on any other DVD (including hers). But beyond what she offers in asana instruction there's that extra indescribable ""something"" that leaves your soul shining when you're done.
As I've said in my other reviews of her videos (because of course I had to buy them all), the DVDs are worth every penny.",1326499200,,772,4.642335766423358
8463302,5,B005AIHXKW,"This is THE most incredible yoga DVD!  No other yoga DVD has ever inspired me to do it again and again, to push a little further and harder, and to look forward to its practise.  It's a challenging workout, but very well balanced, and her voice and choice of music just match perfectly.  I thank Janet Stone for creating such a beautiful sequence of asanas.",1324598400,,357,4.461538461538462
8463303,5,B005AIHXKW,"I'll leave it to the more left-brained linear folks talk about the progression of the flow. It's already been said in fabulous detail by another reviewer. I am prompted to review how this practice made me feel.
The Pranayama in the beginning set the tone for me. Focus, come into my dear body, be here, right now, in this breath. Then this one. Then we start to move. Janet is a goddess of creative and unusual/unexpected combinations in her vinyasas. It felt really good to start from my core and move outward from there. Open the heart, open the back. Open the psoas, open the hips. Reach to the heavens, ground into the Earth. The union of opposites joyfully striven for, attained, breathed in, experienced, released.
By about the 3/4 mark I (unexpectedly) just busted wide open. Tears rose from stuck places, heart opened and felt like it expanded so far beyond the boundaries of my ribcage, it didn't seem like the room I was in was even containing it. The tears; joy and grief, continued to trickle forth all the way into savasana.
Now, about an hour after doing this practice, my chi is still humming and my body feels loved and deeply nourished.
What a gift I gave to myself by buying this DVD!
70 minutes of ""Oh, yes!"" and ""I would like another, please.""",1322697600,8,1263,4.568281938325991
