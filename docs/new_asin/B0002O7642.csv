DANCERS IN MY YOUNGER DAYS",1130284800,9,89,3.9444444444444446
2110165,5,B0002O7642,"I think this is an excellent dvd for those who want to see how striptease/stripping use to be done.  Also, it offers great ideas (not instruction) for ladies who'd like to put together a striptease routine. All of the ladies strip down to pasties and g-strings so the nudity, if one can call it that, is mimimal.  I think this dvd would make a great v-day or birth day gift for the man (or woman)in your life!  It's cute and innocent.  I'd recommend reading Tempest Storm's or Blaze Star's bios along with this tape.  It'll give the novice further insight into this time period of stripping.",1107043200,28,591,4.537735849056604
2110166,3,B0002O7642,"Although this documentary only takes in the American perspective, it is quite a good history from pre 1900 till the late 50s. I recommend this as a valuable study aid to students who are studying this subject for whatever reason, but it is not a film to get your rocks off or be titillated to.",1105056000,12,293,4.345454545454546
2110167,3,B0002O7642,"...of the striptease/burlesque film collections--I've found there's not too many out there--I bought one from a adult site and it was one of the worst DVDs I've ever seen--the footage was unwatchable, all scratches, blinding exposures and unnecessary closeups by the ""director""--a two-DVD set from Something Weird (also available from this site) was impressive in its amount of content (2 DVDs) but half of one was a 3D film, and the rest was tame even for the subject and time frame--I remember only two short films/dances that stuck out (pardon the pun) and out of over 3 hours, that ain't good--this DVD, on the other hand, reminds me of a documentary I saw on German TV while living in Stuttgart--as a matter of fact some of that same footage is on this disc, which impressed me as I thought I'd never see it again--there are complete dances of Tempest Storm, Dixie Evans, Sally Rand (one at some outdoor ""picnic""/""fair"" I'd never seen before, which was highly erotic for its public setting alone vice a stage) but the dance footage of Bettie (sic) Page, Lili St. Cyr is strangely edited--also the Page and Storm footage is taken from the previously released ""Varietease"", etc. films that, again, Something Weird has already released--my main complaint is the narration: it is pleasant and competent instead of overblown and hokey but it tends to go into the start and even cut into parts of the dance footage and I, as I'm sure you, would rather hear the period music uninterrupted--the positives, besides the sum of collected footage which is varied and is of good quality and contains a surprising amount of nudity, would be the bonus footage of stripping and ""nudie cutie"" films and the price--in all, I only take away two stars as the footage should have been unedited, for the intrusive narration and the fact that I still hope that there will be an actual collection of burlesque/stripper footage that is lengthy, unadorned of modern frippery and covers the gamut of the stars who graced the stage/screen--until then, of this type of ""quickie"" DVD that grabs footage where it can and hurriedly throws on the market for the impulse sell to the eager for this type of subject matter, this has been the best of the lot...so far.",1100044800,53,2236,4.810389610389611

8029845,1,B0002O7642,"This video was unlike anything you mentioned on your ad! It was more like a Goddam documentary than an old time burlesque video!! True, it gave a background and well documented history on some of the dancers I never knew about. But it didn't include some of the dancers you advertised about!! I could get off more watching the nude scenes from 80's horror movies, please stop selling this video! It just plain sucks!!!!",1394928000,,419,4.675675675675675
8029846,3,B0002O7642,"Once upon a time in America, a man who wanted to see a naked woman other than his wife went to a burlesque theatre, where he was treated to bawdy comics, sentimental singers, and strip tease artists.  Given the laws of the day, the latter seldom took it all off--but they often went as far as the law allowed and then some.  Some were simply buxom babes who posed, wiggled, posed, and then wiggled some more.  Some were more imaginative and developed signature acts.  A rare few were so celebrated that they became household names.

STRIP TEASE is essentially a documentary display of the ""exotic dancers"" of the late 1940s and 1950s, offering vintage clips of a dozen or so of the forgotten and famous as they ply their trade.  Easily the most famous is Gypsy Rose Lee (1911-1970), who was more widely admired for her wit and ribald personality than her actual disrobings--and who performs one of her distinctly comic routines for the Hollywood camera.  Sally Rand (1904-1979) is a truly legendary performer, the creator of both the ""fan dance"" and the ""bubble dance,"" a remarkably graceful creature with an elegant body.

Tempest Storm wasn't famous because she could dance; the New Orleans-based Kalatan, also known as ""The Heavenly Body,"" could dance indeed.  Bettie Page is very famous, but she was a pin-up model rather than a stripper.  Dixie Evans was sassy and twisty--the ""Marilyn Monroe"" of the burlesque world.  And then there is Lili St. Cyr, who didn't so much dance or strip as strike poses in fancifully high-tone settings.  Others include Rosita Royce, Naoma Silverheels, Myrna Dean, Cherry Knight, Patti Waggin, Marie Voe, Betty Rowland, Rose La Rose, Tarza Young, and Josephine Baker--a major star in France but scarcely known in her American homeland.  There's even a brief glimpse of the original Little Egypt, who shocked staid Americans with her belly dance at the 1893 World's Fair.

The emphasis is on ""tease"" instead of ""strip,"" and by today's standards the acts are tame.  Although some fully expose their breasts, most make use of pasties, and while panties may come off they are inevitably backed by g-strings.  Given the changes in both morality and ideas about feminine beauty, very often the result is more camp than erotic; nonetheless, it was all pretty hot stuff at the time--and part of its heat arose from the fundamental innocence involved.  The DVD also contains a bonus in the form of about fifteen minutes of short films, wherein unidentified strip teasers bump, grind, and shake as much as possible.

It is an interesting bit of nostalgia.  Even so, STRIPTEASE doesn't really show off its performers to their best advantage.  Clips are clearly cut from longer material, so we don't really get to see the performers for any substantial length of time, and there are several strip tease artists you'd expect to be included but who aren't, with Blaze Starr, Ann Corio, and Candy Barr cases in point.  Recommended, but this DVD only scratches the surface.

8029847,5,B0002O7642,"Excellent video of how the striptease industry started.  Very sensual, sexy ladies doing the striptease very tastefully.  I got this video to see & learn how to elegantly move in a seductive way but not a hard core way.  Great lessons & my guy loved it.",1209254400,2,253,4.456521739130435
8029848,5,B0002O7642,I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd. It has many complete dances that I have never seen before and a hiliarious narration of tidbits and burlesque history. I have already watched it several time and it still enjoyable on the 5th viewing!,1202688000,2,231,4.8
8029849,3,B0002O7642,"Some good footage of bad dancers. Filmed in a 'documentary' style so fairly clean, could even be shown on late night tv. I enjoyed the info. as the dance progressed thru the ages, legal matters and ways around them but the dancing itself was poor for the most part.  Good to all to an overall collection but doesn't stand alone.",1198800000,,328,4.466666666666667
8029850,4,B0002O7642,"Good historic review when people with average bodies  rocked the audience with style, panache and for some grace.  Simpler times and less access to the public allowed for variety, and a lot of artists to be engaged.",1197417600,,215,4.783783783783784
8029851,5,B0002O7642,"I recommend this dvd for burlesque fans, performers, and pop culture history buffs. An array of dancers from various eras and show circuits are shown, with a bit of narrative about each. Dozens of dancers are featured, including Dixie Evans, Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee, Lily St Cyr, and Josephine Baker. many of the dances are shown full-length, which is especially valuable for people who are studying burlesque as an art form to emulate or refer to in their own work. And it's just plain fun to watch!

One caveat--as with many clips of old burlesque footage, many of these dancers are shown to different music than the dancers were actually performing to. The enormous cost of using the original music often results in this kind of clip, which makes it difficult to evaluate just how good these performers actually were. Maybe some of them were much better than they appear to be, some worse--but no doubt they could hit a beat now and then!",1149638400,14,944,4.721212121212122
8029852,4,B0002O7642,"Video as advertised, but some of it overly ""sanitized;"" e. g., Gyspy Rose Lee.

Still, a fair example of the genre.",1140912000,5,115,4.476190476190476
