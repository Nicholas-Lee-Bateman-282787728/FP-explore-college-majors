5696767,5,B00C7Q25EO,"you have to watch a lot of nordic crime dramas to get to the good ones. this is one of the excellent ones. i care about the characters, excellent writing, great character development. highly recommend it. glad i persuaded my library to get this one",1417824000,2,248,4.533333333333333
5696768,4,B00C7Q25EO,"As my title indicates this is a good solid quality series BUT yikes!! it is soooo slow,It is true to the novel which is  a plus over the typical U.S. series which so many times only shares the title",1395705600,,198,4.076923076923077
5696769,5,B00C7Q25EO,"I highly recommend this series.  Since each story is three hours long, it isn't frenetic in its pace.  Each of the several members of the ""A Team"" gets featured at various times (sometimes the main character in one of the episodes) you get to know them and all of their personalities and quirks.  The stories are compelling--Europa Blues is one of the most gripping of all of the Nordic Noir programs--comparable to The Killing.  The only Swedish Program of equal quality is the original Wallander.",1390435200,9,498,4.823529411764706
5696770,5,B00C7Q25EO,"Great acting, intelligent, complex plots and sub-plots, occasional humor, characters you care about. The episodes revolve around Team A, an elite police force in Sweden headed by a smart older policewoman. The main characters were recruited from all over Sweden to work on difficult cases involving murder and other serious crimes. Unlike some other Nordic crime shows, the country itself didn't play a huge role e.g. few shots of gorgeous scenery,etc. but focused on the characters and plots. I recommend these movies for all of the above. In Swedish with English sub-titles.",1383868800,15,576,5.271739130434782
5696771,1,B00C7Q25EO,"A gratuitous Russian Bank robber, with a tooth ache and mysteriously assassinated by an arrow shot into his eye immediately followed by the dumbest police procedures imaginable purportedly  kick this into play. There is just too much quality in this genre to watch the ""knock offs.""",1492819200,,282,5.130434782608695
5696772,5,B00C7Q25EO,I loved this series.  Just wish I didn't have to pay for it.,1491868800,,60,3.6153846153846154
5696773,5,B00C7Q25EO,"I  love all those Swedish mini series  impossible to find in the USA. My favorite was ""the bridge"", copied by the French (very good too) and the Mexican (boring).
But this Arne Dahl is one of the best. The team of policewomen and policemen has to solve a case, or two, and in the meantime, their family life suffers because they work 24/7.
I highly recommend it and I am so addicted I ordered season 2 yesterday!",1491177600,,412,4.337662337662338
5696774,4,B00C7Q25EO,"Well done series, not far off from the books. My husband dislikes the primary detective, but I don't.",1487203200,,101,4.666666666666667
5696775,5,B00C7Q25EO,"Excellent !!. Entertaining and smart.
And a plus... because we have the opportunity to ""peek"" into a society issues in a different country with a different approach from their police.
PLEASE AMAZON and HMz!! Make available SEASON TWO!! It was great to check and find out A SECOND SEASON IS ALREADY OUT THERE!! :)

(Note: A pleasure to see a country where everybody speaks fluently at least two languages and to speak a third is seen as a great value).",1482537600,,451,4.6375

5696779,5,B00C7Q25EO,"I'm TOTALLY hooked on this show but NOT on the price. I enjoy the dialogue, the direction, and the writing on this show. I hardly even realize that I'm READING the dialogue!",1461024000,,173,4.4375
5696780,5,B00C7Q25EO,This is simple one of the best tv series I've seen.  It ranks almost with Beck.,1459900800,,79,3.9375
5696781,4,B00C7Q25EO,Greatly enjoyed but it just misses 5 stars am looking forward to season 2,1458000000,,73,4.285714285714286

5696784,5,B00C7Q25EO,Some of the best TV out there.,1456531200,,30,3.4285714285714284
5696785,5,B00C7Q25EO,Another excellent European crime drama. I thought it would pretty hard to come close to Unit One...but this show is an equal match. I am about half way through this season and I love it...well developed characters and superb actors.,1455667200,2,232,4.825
5696786,1,B00C7Q25EO,"With the benefit of doubt I've been hoping it would get better. Not so. It seems the responsibility lies with direction as well as acting.  Or perhaps its genuine in how the Swedes overreact to some of life's bumps.  When each respective person has any difficulty they over emotionalize the situation.
Screaming, faux vomiting, driving fast, etc.  They express a feeling with  boringly exaggerated external detail. No inner work that every good actor knows how to do.  Hard too to care about any character as well. Writing and direction responsibility. Another fact is that it's way over priced.",1454112000,,595,5.030612244897959
5696787,1,B00C7Q25EO,Dreadful. Wooden bland characters and a rambling disconnected script. Literally fell asleep during the first episode and was nodding off during the second. Just because it's Scandinavian doesn't mean that it's good. It's not. Pretty much the opposite in all ways to The Killing or The Bridge.,1450483200,,292,5.23404255319149
5696788,3,B00C7Q25EO,"The weakest of the Swedish gang.  Not even close the ""Swedish Bron/Broen, bridge.  Or UNIT ONE, Or THE EAGLE, or ,or or.or,or.!",1449964800,2,127,4.7272727272727275
5696789,5,B00C7Q25EO,"I think there was more than one season of this and a few years ago I was fortunate enough to be able to watch all of them. They were absolutely terrific episodes. This is crime drama at its absolute best. These began as books and then were made into the tv show, much like the Wallander series. But no one has attempted to make an English language version of this. It is all Swedish and I liked it for that. I also read a great deal of what's called ""Scandinavian Noir"" and this series, in both tv and book format, is right at the top of that genre.

One huge difference between this and Wallander is that one is about a lone wolf policeman who tends to go off the reservation a lot (Kurt Wallander) while the other (this one) is about a team of crime fighters who work tightly together to solve very hard crimes. They have to support one another constantly so they cannot just plummet wildly in their own direction following their own hunches as it could get everyone else killed.

These are all double episodes. Each story is told over two episodes. My favorite is about the American serial killer who ends up in Sweden and this team must work in tandem with the FBI. You have NEVER seen an FBI story like this one! But the whole season is great. You can't miss with this one. Top notch!",1449532800,,1289,4.300411522633745

8578407,4,B00C7Q25EO,This show is really good and grows on you as you watch more episodes.  I usually take exception to spending time on the characters' personal lives in mysteries or crime dramas but here it made them more believable.  The characters grow on you and the mysteries are engrossing.,1528243200,,276,4.729166666666667
8578408,5,B00C7Q25EO,Outstanding. Hard to find a flaw. Characters are exceptional--and in one case magical.,1527552000,,86,5.6923076923076925
8578409,4,B00C7Q25EO,"This is a great Swedish series based on the ''A-Gruppen'' novel series by Jan Arnald (Arne Dahl is his nom de plume) which were one of the best products of the ''Nordic Noir'' genre. Unfortunately, due to the lack of English editions regarding the last novels of the series, I've only read the first six and I can honestly admit that it was a splendid and rewarding experience. The distinguishing mark of ''A-Gruppen'' books was that there were no main characters, but it was rather the team that consisted the protagonist of the series. Each novel focuses specifically on one or two members of the elite group of Swedish police, and we become familiar with their personal stories and problems, which always, as everything in Arne Dahl's novels, interconnects with the different parts of the main plot. The stories are usually perhaps a bit more complicated than absolutely needed but this doesn't spoil any of the fun. The adaptation of the novels to two one-and-a-half hour episodes allows a more or less faithful adaptation of the complex book plotlines and the final result is more than satisfying. The casting consists of a Swedish all-star group of actors such as Shanti Roney, Matias Varela, Malin Arvidsson, Claes Ljungmark and many others. ''Arne Dahl'' is a tv production worthy of the name of the great Swedish author.",1526860800,,1329,4.911111111111111
8578410,5,B00C7Q25EO,"Intelligent and human crime series, with a purposeful development of the main characters. The only disappointment is that there is only one Season.",1521072000,,147,5.434782608695652
8578411,1,B00C7Q25EO,"This is my first Amazon review bc as a fan of Nordic Noir and so-called ""Scandi thrillers,"" this was pedestrian and lacking depth. Don't waste your time with this ""A"" Team. Combined, they get a D+. I miss Wallander....",1518048000,,218,4.615384615384615
8578412,5,B00C7Q25EO,"Excellent series, up to scandinavian standards.  Characters engaging and gradual building of rapport was well done.  Thumbs down to Mhz for being so slow about releasing more.",1517702400,,175,5.444444444444445
8578413,3,B00C7Q25EO,"I found it a bit disjointed but liked the characters.  But into the third episode when they got into the evils of the American CIA, they lost me.  I am tired of foreigners, although I am an avid foreign film watcher, slamming America  in some way.  Aside from that, if you are into fast paced action you will not like this.",1514764800,,323,4.245901639344262
8578414,5,B00C7Q25EO,"""Arne Dahl"" is a ten-episode 2012 Swedish murder mystery and drama series, based on the books of the Swedish crime novelist Jan Arnald, who uses the pen name Arne Dahl when writing crime fiction. The story line centers around the activities of the A Unit, a highly-specialized team of Swedish homicide detectives tasked with investigating and solving a series of challenging and high-profile murder cases. ""Arne Dahl"" features an intelligent and intriguing story line, interesting and likable characters, and the dark and foreboding Nordic Noir. Arne Dahl is a decidedly intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful murder mystery and drama series, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. Arne Dahl features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1509235200,,886,5.57037037037037
