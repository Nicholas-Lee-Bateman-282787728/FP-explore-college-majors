2516821,5,B000EDWLTG,"I enjoyed this series very much. On the surface it's just another detective show. But it has a wry British twist to it. Based on Leslie Thomas' 4 novels about ""Dangerous Davies"", a good-natured, comically unfortunate detective, this new Granada/ITV production is a welcome respite from the hardnosed, grimy detective shows which we have become accustomed to of late. DC (Detective Constable) Davies is a very ordinary fellow, middle-aged, unlucky in life and unlucky in love. But he has a ready smile, a friendly word for everyone and most importantly, a kind heart. With Peter Davison at the helm, this makes for a very amiable series, much like its lead character and the actor portraying him. It is as much Davies' interaction with the people around him, his ex-wife, friends, colleagues and witnesses, as the mysteries that he stumbles upon, that make this series so enjoyable. Mostly it appeals to the British sense of cheering on the underdog.

Peter Davison, who for many will forever be the rascally Tristan Farnon from the beloved BBC production of ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" has aged very gracefully and made a new name for himself as the downtrodden, though always lovable, DC Davies. One British newspaper reviewer even referred to him as ""the cuddly detective"".

It is already into its fourth season in the UK. Unlike American series, each season consists of just 4 episodes. Each episode is about 70-75 minutes long. The pilot episode runs for 95 minutes. Of the four episodes in this first season, three are based on the original novels. Only Episode 3, ""Tricia,"" is new material. The plot of the fourth and last novel is only televised at the end of Season 2. The fourth novel sees Davies retiring from the force and setting up his own detective agency. In the TV series however, Davies never retires but goes plodding along in his dead-end job as a superannuated detective constable.

The series was shot in high defintion widescreen. The DVD presents it in its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (Anamorphic). Picture quality is good with rich vibrant colours and deep inky blacks. Sound is in the original 2.0 Dolby Surround. No subtitles are provided. There are no extras save for some unrelated trailers.",1150934400,58,2228,4.936

2516823,5,B000EDWLTG,"What a wonderful series!  PLEASE - PLEASE - PLEASE release the whole series.  Peter Davidson is perfectly cast - once you get past expecting him to be the self-centered Tristan Farnon.  This series is absolutely down-to-earth.  Dangerous Davies is a wonderful, honest, decent and human hero who doggedly pursues even small clues and seemingly trivial details to a very believable conclusion.  The interest here lies in the characters and in how all the pieces come together -- not in some terrible sinister plot or horrendously gruesome crime -- but in the kind of sad, everyday misadventure that you could read about in any newpaper any day of the week.  Mod, Dangerous Davies confidant, is an interesting kind of misfit -- an intellect who lives life according to his own rules -- and he provides much of the comic relief of the series.  This is a thoroughly entertaining and genuinely uplifting series.  We want more!!!",1148515200,8,922,4.941558441558442
2516824,5,B000EDWLTG,"My husband and I took the other reviewers advice and ordered this DVD.  What a wonderful series this is!  It is low key with marvelous characterizations and acting.  The plots are logical and satisfying and Peter Davison is so endearing. We devotely hope there will be a second series.

Thank you, Reviewers!",1148256000,9,308,4.865384615384615
2516825,5,B000EDWLTG,"I did not even know that Leslie Thomas' mysteries had been made into a television series, much less one with Peter Davison.  When I found this set though I bought it at once and do not regret in in the least.

Like Inspector Barnaby in the  Midsomer Mysteries, the detective played by Davison in this series is incredibly decent, while there is also a good amount of both pathos and humor in his interaction with the public, his ex-wife and his fellows in the police.  His wife observes that she loves a man in uniform and their marriage was over when he made CID.  His boss states that if he had his way Davies would be back in uniform and visiting schools to offer safety tips.  Davies refuses to ask for a transfer out of the CID office of Willesden, probably because he knows it would be refused.  Between a rock and a hard place seems to be home to Davies, but he is still a very good detective, sometimes to his own dismay when things work out very black indeed.

Now for the thing that fascinates me about this series and other British series I have watched in the past-- Davison doesn't make any effort to cover up the fact that he is going bald.  In fact it's rather endearing.  Having had male colleagues who have gone to outrageous lengths to look a little less bald-- spray on scalp paint, anyone? A combover?  A weave?  Hair transplant????  No, no, just a natural look and a fine disposition will do, thank you very much.",1146960000,61,1434,4.386363636363637
2516826,5,B000EDWLTG,"The Last Detective is a fabulous show that is steeped in charm and class.  Peter Davison unobtrusively holds the show together as the decent but overlooked PC 'Dangerous' Daviies who, through unflashy police work and dogged determination reveals important truths in the overlooked and seemingly unimportant.

Davison is assisted in his task by a superlative supporting cast, most notably Sean Hughs as his drinking buddy Mod and Rob Spendlove as his dyspepsic boss.

The production quality of this programme is high and the script and performances sincere and humourous.  The dark side of crime is not avoided in this programme and it can enter some dark territory but, like Dangerous himself, you never loose faith in human nature.  The enormous affection and popularity of this show in the UK may have much to do with the affection held for the underdog and while this programme plays to this affection you never loose respect for Dangerous.  Davison magnificently pulls off the task of portraying a characher who is professionally overlooked, unlucky in love but stubbonly loyal - to the truth, and to people and cases, who, like him, are sidlined in life.

As an aside I would also like to make an honourable mention to the soundtrack of this show.  The composer should be proud as it is unobtrusive but sets the secene perfectly.  Its minor key conveys the tragedy of crime and the lugubrious nature of Davies' plodding with a lighter harmony that refelcts the comic flourishes of the show.

In conclusion this series is a gem which I highly recommend.  Buy it and be rewarded by gentle but honest stories about not so gentle and not always so honest people.",1144886400,129,1663,4.882562277580071

2516828,5,B000EDWLTG,"It's charming. Usually some investigation of a low level crime leads to an interesting twist with a human interest angle, but not Pollyanna-ish. Careful, clever writing and pleasing characters.  In crime fiction,  this is called a ""cosy"".",1486166400,,238,5.405405405405405
2516829,4,B000EDWLTG,"Quite a performance contrast from the feckless Tristan Farnum role he played in that lovely series, ""All Creatures Great and Small.""  The slow start  as the precinct pariah is an unusual premise.  I'll have to wait and see how the series develops,  I'm not an avid TV viewer so it will take a while to get the next two or three episodes behind me and allow an informed evaluation.",1486166400,,380,4.463768115942029

2516833,5,B000EDWLTG,"I came across this series by accident, but I am glad I did. The lead character, DC ""Dangerous"" Davies is shunned by his fellow detectives for not being cool. However, he usually has the last laugh, if he felt like laughing, when his minor cases turn out to be big deals due to his persistent investigation.
  No real violence, blood or gore, just interesting and sometimes comical cases. If you like series like ""Rosemary and Thyme"" you will probably love The Last Detective.",1486166400,,475,4.710843373493976

""Dangerous"" Davies is nicknamed ""Dangerous"" because he is the opposite - mild mannered, polite, caring, empathetic, truthful, fair, honest and honorable, stumbling along gently through mishaps in his personal life, enduring the obnoxious sneers and bratty treatment of two of his fellow detectives and his boss who rarely believe in him until he solves the crime in his own bulldog-stubborn way of following up on faint leads and possibilities the others dismiss with a jeering laugh.  Why he stays friends with Mod is beyond me as the guy is way beyond the irritating jerk category, but he does add a lot of humorous byplay to the series.  I've now watched all 4 seasons and recommend it as a very pleasant change of pace while staying within the mystery/crime series genre.",1484784000,2,1072,4.944444444444445

2516927,3,B000EDWLTG,"Quirky, funny, sad at times. This character is endearing, a genuinely nice guy in a crap world.  His best friend is fun. He loves his dog. He does his job.

I will watch longer to see if he finds his way.",1475107200,,331,3.8676470588235294

2516933,5,B000EDWLTG,This series was one of the reasons I subscribed to Acorn TV and I must say The Last Detective is worth the subscription by itself.  Of course I've watched many of the other series and there are more on my watch list but so far this is one of my favorites.  You see the blatant disrespect among some of Constable Davies' colleagues slowly change and evolve into admiration and respect.  There are plenty of lighthearted moments that help move the story line along.,1474243200,,463,4.554216867469879
2516934,3,B000EDWLTG,It presents an interesting twist to detective sit-coms underlain with a very annoying and illogical character interaction thread.,1474243200,,129,6.222222222222222

2516936,4,B000EDWLTG,"I like the main character because he is so atypical for the lead in a police drama. The scripts have been somewhat average, but I am intrigued to see how the storyline develops his character and the relationships he has with co-workers and his ex wife.

2516940,5,B000EDWLTG,"Charming show with a wonderful lead who manages to pull off being the ""sad sack"" at the police station--the last detective his boss is ever going to give an assignment to--and yet come across as a compassionate, sometimes befuddled but ultimately strong presence. You root for him! Well done, Peter Davison. A slow and easy pace--what one might call a ""cozy"" show--with nice characters you want to pass the time with.",1473465600,,417,4.887323943661972

2516981,5,B000EDWLTG,"What a refreshing take on the police procedural drama. Nobody takes ""Dangerous Davis"" seriously except Dangerous. He want's to be the best cop out there and he tries really hard but as with the rest of us, things don't always break his way. His boss hates him but it's hard to really hate Dangerous. He's on the outs with his wife. She want's to admire him but she just can't find it in her to do it. Instead she makes his life miserable. His best pal has a new scheme or a new job every episode.

2517065,4,B000EDWLTG,"Better late than never, right?  Well, as I'm digging through my Acorn TV subscription on Amazon, I came across The Last Detective.  It is another good British crime show, only this one has a kindhearted detective centered in the middle of the mystery.

Detective ""Dangerous"" Davies is the poor sod that no one likes.  He's ridiculed at work, jokes are played upon him by coworkers, and his boss isn't much support.  Since he's not in the top-ten as far as popularity, he always gets the crap cases no one else wants.

The guy may be boring to some, but he has a good analytical mind and always solves the case.  He's determined, kind, and treats people with respect, regardless of the fact the man gets no respect in return from his ex-wife or coworkers. He is the poster boy for ""turning the other cheek"" whenever he is wronged by others.

He has two rather odd partners in life -- his dog that he gets visitation with and a deadbeat friend, played by Sean Hughes, who is always changing jobs.  He's an odd duck that can spout off surprising trivia but comes as across as a loser with a big ""L"" on his forehead. Nevertheless, he is the only one who listens to what Dangerous has to say and is a true friend indeed.

I have just finished the first season and found it entertaining.  Frankly, I like the lead Peter Davison.  He's perfect for the part with kind eyes and a calming tone to his voice -- not bad looking either when he smiles.

The stories are based on a series of novels written by Leslie Thomas.  Apparently, this is the second television series, with the first airing in 1981 with Bernard Cribbins.

Another good one to check out!  I have three more seasons to finish but am sure they will be entertaining.",1458950400,,1721,4.4504792332268375

In this first series, a bored, non-assertive, and so, unimpressive detective (which is what his boss and the department in general think of him, as well as himself) feels unchallenged by the usual, every day police cases, until he finds a cold case that seems to finally challenge what would become his untapped potential, (of cold cases) of the old detective (""Last Detective"" title) instinct and the dodged persistence that could still prove, for (a) closed unsolved case (s) a successful conclusion, which do, redeeming his reputation.

The only thing missing in the story line of being the last detective to be assigned to a case or just being assigned to missing pet cases is how it came to be.  With each episode you like him better and feel that he is beginning to gain a tiny bit of respect from his superiors, who are all jerks. His cases usually center on crimes that don't always appear to be crimes at first and no self respecting Detective Sargent would pursue, but the Last Detective sorts out a case and solves with his erst while companion, Mod, who is weird to say the least.",1376784000,2,695,4.297709923664122
2517138,5,B000EDWLTG,"I am tired of supermen, who solve crimes. You know the ones I mean; the detectives blessed with special insights, their special friends with their special gifts, the car chases, the magnum-weapons, the miraculous forensics that dissipate the fog of crime. If forensics are so perfect, if detectives so brilliant, why does so much crime remain unsolved, and, if solved at all, only after many, many years? But I digress.

If you want to watch a detective, who solves crimes the old fashioned way with interviews, with phone calls, with the easy grace of a guy, who is trying to help, and most of all by the generous expenditure of his own shoe-leather, Detective Constable Dangerous Davies is your man. Notice here that he is not Chief Inspector Davies, nor Inspector Davies nor even Detective Sergeant Davies. Davies is a plodder; a man long dismissed by his superiors as a good man to send out on the nuisance jobs, helping little old ladies, who hear things go ""bump-in-the-night"". Davies was dubbed ""Dangerous"" by the young up-and-comers, because they consider him more of a danger to himself than the criminal class. Yet on Davies plods; a kind word here, an understanding smile there, a willingness too listen over a cup of tea and a biscuit.

Even his personal life rings true. His marriage has failed but he still cares deeply for his wife. He even shares custody of his dog. His best friend is the sort of chap, who a lonely man will meet and learn to like in a pub. His landlady has her eyes on him, but he has not the inclination to respond. And yet, as in his professional life, on Davies soldiers. Expect no fireworks nor car chases, no flashes of insight nor flights of intuition, no passionate trysts nor tearful reconciliation. On Davies plods with a smile, a kind word and a careful ear to the ground.

I have only one complaint; not with the stories but with the quality of the DVD. The show was produced in England with oh-so-English actors, but without the benefit of sub-titles. Be prepared to watch an episode two or three times before you catch all the nuances. You will, however, find that re-watching is like meeting an old friend at a pub for a pint. It would be just like Davies to see it that way. He must be rubbing off on me.",1376697600,2,2254,4.574257425742574

It's a very mild police show, without guns, violence and unnecessary gore, that seems to be the flavor of all American TV mystery shows.

Davison steals his scenes with his school boy looks, thinning hair, and winning smile.  The stories are always good and his sidekick - dopey as he appears, is, oft times, a great help in solving the crime.

2517231,5,B000EDWLTG,"After having watched one episode of ""Vera"" and a few episodes of ""Trial and Retribution"", this show was a welcome and wonderful change. Davies is not just the understated, underdog who refuses to give up despite constant put-downs from co-workers and boss but he also models the ability to assert himself respectfully and maintain boundaries in the face of individuals who are constantly challenging him. He's a genuine and decent adult in every sense of the word: not just another cliched flawed-but-tortured detective whose life outside the job is in ruins (""Luther"", anyone?) The mysteries themselves actually make sense (first episode of ""Vera"", anyone?) and it is all-around a pleasure to watch.

In addition, themes explored were uncommon: when is the last time you saw a show that dealt with sexuality of senior-aged women, a group all but completely disregarded by Hollywood et al? See episode 2: ""Dangerous by Moonlight"". Although the venue and period differs completely this show reminds me a little bit of ""The Ladies Number One Detective Agency"" complete with similar gentle and endearing humor. For anyone who loves those books or the HBO show try this one out too, you won't be disappointed.",1359504000,,1205,5.116751269035533
2517232,4,B000EDWLTG,"Review for the pilot only -

Watched this on the basis of the reviews.  It is sweet and slow.  Our last detective DC Dangerous Davis (Dangerous being a very sarcastic nickname) is a decent,  quiet fellow. Everyone around him seems to feel that he  has not accomplished enough for his age,  and very unusually,  he has twinges of that too.  This issue of self-doubt is usually solved within the hour in a US show,  but I have a feeling it will linger far longer here. Well, Davis finds himself a more important case,  but solving it is more complex than he thought and victory is more bitter than sweet.

On the basis of the pilot I will watch the next one.",1359158400,,656,4.338842975206612
2517233,5,B000EDWLTG,"Am always on the lookout for the quintessential British mystery to watch that has an intriguing narrative, original dialogue, fine acting etc.  When I first started watching this episode, I was on the treadmill, and missed some of the lines and was having a hard time following the plot but suddenly it started to coalesce quickly and became a very involving story.  I saw the great reviews and knew it had to be good.  The actor who plays Dangerous, the detective, is very believable and endearing.  As one of the characters said of him: ""you have a kind face"".  But he's been on a losing streak, marriage dissolved, career going nowhere, boss from hell along with colleagues of similar ilk.  Things are going south until he starts investigating on the sly a cold case.

Suddenly, it's obvious that he has a lot more going for him than his ex-wife, coworkers and he himself realized, but still not a happy ending.  In fact his boss indicates he might be the ""last detective"" he'd call on--when you watch the show, you'll see why.

Not a promising start for a flourishing career for the detective, but we can guess he still is going to get some interesting cases for this series to flourish.  He will just have to out maneuver his boss.  It will add to the suspense to see how he does this.

If you liked the Jackson Brodie series, which I adored, this one has a bit of the same quirky music and ""down and out"" and lovable detective going for it.

Am looking forward to getting back on the treadmill to watch the second show in the series.  It will be my reward for exercising.",1354320000,,1577,4.487719298245614

His colleagues are jerks, but they make Davies look good. Highly recommend this series.

Peter Davison is so perfectly suited for this part, you would think the author had written it for him.  each episode/mystery is well-crafted and intricate.  things are not cut and dried or black and white.  he is a policeman who cares and that can make his life difficult, but it endears him to us.",1229299200,,491,4.47191011235955
2517244,5,B000EDWLTG,"I love this series.  That's no surprise as I usually love anything Peter Davison is in.  I consider this somewhat of a cozy crime series, not as cozy as Murder She Wrote or anything by Agatha Christie, but definitely not dark and gritty.

Davison plays the affable detective Dangerous Davies who can't seem to be taken seriously by anyone.  He still plods along though like the every-day man that he is which makes him all the more endearing.

I'm not sure what other reviewers were talking about in needing captioning (maybe they were joking?).  Maybe it's because I watch tons of British television, but I understood every word the actors were saying.

All in all, I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a lighter crime series.",1228176000,2,739,4.638461538461539

The casting was brilliantly done as the show is replete w/winsome characters in addition to our hero, Dangerous.
Each mystery is an intelligent journey for your mind to guess who is the guilty party.
All this  W/OUT needless explosions and car chases EVERY week as 'fillers' to take up the allotted time. You actually get an intelligent STORY and insights into the cHARACTERS as opposed to bloody gore, explosions etc etc ad nauseum.
I do like action adventure MOVIES but not as weekly series....I like depth

2517246,5,B000EDWLTG,"""The Last Detective, Series 1""is, of course, the first of the popular British mystery series, a witty police procedural, to find its way here, and how lucky for us.  The series is based on the Dangerous Davies novels by Welshman Leslie Thomas; it was produced by the British firm Granada for Britain's Independent Television (ITV).

It stars that affable Everyman Peter Davison (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Series-1-Collection/dp/B000062XDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Series 1 Collection</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Campion-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00008DDXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Campion - The Complete First Season</a>) as the title character, a lowly detective constable, called ""Dangerous"" Davies ironically, as he is of hardly any danger to the criminal elements - it's his friends, family, and co-workers who'd better watch out.  And called the last detective by his boss, as in ""You're the last detective I'd ever put on a case, except a crap one.""  The decidedly unglamorous Davies even works in an unimportant, out-of-the way North London precinct, Willesden.

Davison is ably supported by Sean Hughes (the guy from Eejit records in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Commitments/dp/6305622922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Commitments</a>) as his eccentric friend Mod; and Emma Amos as his estranged wife Julie.  Rob Spendlove gives us a tough supervisor, Detective Inspector Aspinall; Charles De'Ath as DS Pimlott and  Billy Geraghty as DC Barrett add greatly to the flavor of the cop shop.  The series is certainly character-rich and character-driven.

Davies is a rumpled, clumsy guy, nice even when he's drunk, and unfailingly polite to little old ladies; nevertheless, he does seem always to get his man - or woman.  The mysteries in this first series, based directly on the works of Thomas are complex and flavorful, though murder itself is in surprisingly short supply.  The episodes are:
1. ""The Last Detective.""  Feature length pilot.  Davies discovers the unsolved 1981 murder of a 17 year old girl.  As he solves it, he proves once again Clare Booth Luce's useful adage, ""No good deed goes unpunished."" And gets himself in dutch with his co-workers.
2. ""Dangerous By Moonlight."" An elderly man has disappeared; his wife, stunningly played by Sian Philips (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius/dp/B00004U12X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius</a>), seems surprisingly unconcerned.  This episode takes Davies to a dance club that caters to senior citizens: he and Mod have got to stay light on their feet.  And it offers further proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
3. ""Tricia."" Davies' kindness to demanding women gets him two thankless cases.  An old busybody has suspicions of her next-door neighbor.  And an attractive young woman seems to be getting unduly involved with him.  Once again, no good deed goes unpunished.
4. ""Lofty."" An eccentric old vagrant (played by popular English comedian Norman Wisdom), whom Davies has befriended in a park, is found dead in a canal.  Davies takes on the case because no one else will.  And no good deed goes unpunished.

This series is witty, entertaining, and intellectually and emotionally satisfying.  But: and here comes the DePue closed captions report: there are none. And the cast spits out rapid-fire North London dialect. You'll have to work for your fun.",1220054400,3,3609,6.08893280632411

2517248,5,B000EDWLTG,"The pilot episode didn't thrill me.  The main character was a bit insipid, uninspiring, and bland.  That is supposed to be his personality, I know, but it just didn't click with me.  But then I watched the next episode, and I found myself liking him more and more.  There was something really appealing about his bumbling, kind ways.  Then I watched the third and fourth episodes and was completely hooked.

It is a typical 'nice guys finish last' storyline, and you could say it's a bit trite - but the main character is so well done, and there's such a brilliant supporting cast that it's enjoyable and fun to watch.  The mysteries are solid - a little transparent at times, but well thought out and coherent.  I started watching for the mysteries, but stayed for the characters.  Even the dog is wonderful (as is Davies's devotion to him).

Bottom line: good stories, great characters, and an all-around well-done series - despite the slightly rocky start.",1215388800,5,959,4.757575757575758
2517249,4,B000EDWLTG,"Being a long-time fan of ""All Creatures Great and Small"" I was curious to see Tristan Farnan (Peter Davison)play another character.  He did a supurb job of acting in this series, however, the plots were somewhat off-beat and not very uplifting.  This was due, in part, to the locations used in the filming -- lower middle class neighborhoods with graffiti abounding.  I know this is realism, however, England has so many gorgeous settings, it was disappointing that the director chose to use only the ugliest urban blight in his background shots.  All in all, I doubt I will purchase additional series of ""The Last Detective"".",1213401600,2,626,4.933333333333334

2517251,5,B000EDWLTG,"Everything I've ever seen with Peter Davison has been a 5 star success. He is genuine, real, and a consummate actor. ""The Last Detective"" Series is no different. I've seen all of the episodes of the first four series and one thread runs through each program--- a truly kind,thoughtful, intelligent, and very funny man is ""Dangerous"" Davies,Peter's character.

The mysteries are intricate but not mind boggling, and the cast of peripheral characters are as unique and entertaining as any I've ever seen. These and the main characters are the kind of people that you come to care about, instilling the series with an additional reason for watching and for anticipating the next episode.

Do not let this sparkling example of television viewing pass you by!

2517254,5,B000EDWLTG,"A good detective series rests squarely on unforgettable characters who garner sympathy and grudging respect. A little humor doesn't hurt either. This series has plenty of all of it.  Dangerous Davies, a sincerely nice guy and always only a step away from finishing last,is a quietly competent cop, yet nothing he does is ever good enough for the brash, smack 'em and gaol 'em members of his squad.  Nice guys,it seems,aren't appreciated by anyone.  Even the felons give him a hard time.  His boss tells him he's the last detective he'd ever assign to a case.  Yet, Dangerous plots on, tracking down the guilty, being helpful to the helpless, keeping the most unlikely of friends, walking his dog and trying his best to get his trollop of a wife to come back to him.

It's enough to make you want to pat him on the back and buy him a beer at his favorite pub. This series is so good and so on the cutting edge of human pathos that the plot becomes almost secondary.",1193702400,3,964,4.48

I've read all of Margary Allingham's novels and really enjoyed the Acorn series that put them into a visual form, but after that set came to a conclusion I was at a loss.  Looking for another character with similar charm, I found the ""Dangerous Davis"" series with Peter Davidson again featured as the central character.  Although Dangerous is anything but dangerous, and the character lacks the sophistication and poise of Albert Campion, he definitely has a personality that appeals just as much.  His capacity to find his way to a brilliant conclusion that gives no one any happiness, even himself, is sad but endearing.  His sympathy with the ""villians"" of the piece is understandable since many of them are the down and out and never win types.  His rapport with them is entertaining.  My favorite scene is one in season 2&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Detective-Series-2/dp/B000H5U5MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Detective - Series 2</a>&nbsp;when he must stop a man with a bomb from leaping from the window to escape arrest.
