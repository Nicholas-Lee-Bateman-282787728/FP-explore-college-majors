8256726,5,B0014ZEAEM,"This is the first Renfrew movie. There are others also available on DVD. Terrific and amusing action comedy. 1 hour black and white. Renfrew, charming, gracious, smart and skilled, can ride a horse, drive cars and motorcycles, pilot planes (and parachute), dive from cliffs, beat bad guys with fisticuffs or, if he must, shoot them in the hand, win cooking contests, sing quite well, romance damsels in distress, make a magnifying glass out of a drop of water and loves his dog. What more could you want?
Extremely entertaining.",1264032000,,528,4.943820224719101
