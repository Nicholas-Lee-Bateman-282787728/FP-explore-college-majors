7916246,5,B00002SWEA,"First of all, be aware that this is a softcore video, like the other Pride Video releases featuring the Bel Ami boys.  If you are not a fan of softcore, then this is not the video for you.  Like all the other videos featuring these boys, this one is full of young Eastern European guys.  The surprising thing is that this is somewhat of an actual ""movie"" with a plot!  The storyline may seem boring by ""normal"" movie standards, but for a softcore video, this is practically an epic.  Warning though- I wasn't prepared for the prominent role of a woman who plays the love interest of the guy who is pursuing Johan.  You see her in bed and everything- not at all expected in a gay softcore video.",1025568000,11,694,4.341085271317829
7916247,1,B00002SWEA,"Dreadful dreck that proves once and for all that gay soft-core erotica can be just as bad as all the straight stuff shown on the premium movie networks in the wee hours of the morning.  So-called plot concerns a straight couple vacationing on the coast, where the man falls for a comely beach boy.  The pacing is s-l-o-w; the film-to-video transfer is wretched; the dialogue (in multiple languages) is trite; even the nudity and simulated sex are boring.  Don't order this one if you're hungry for a filling story or even a little taste of eye candy --- what you'll be served is a big stale piece of snore pie smothered in thick, unappetizing yawn sauce.",1005004800,7,654,4.620689655172414
7916248,5,B00002SWEA,"Attractive young men, a real plot, appropriate scenery and excellent photography.  The actors actually acted, and showed emotion, the plot was believable.  This movie represents a real evolution upward for softcore gay erotica, and is a must have for people who enjoy that motif!",971222400,8,279,5.318181818181818
