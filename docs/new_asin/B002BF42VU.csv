3893700,2,B002BF42VU,"I must say that Spider-Woman is my favorite female superhero from Marvel Comics. Unfortunately this cartoon does not do the Jessica Drew I knew as a child any justice (No Pun Intended). Billy, Jeff and Justice Magazine never appeared in the comic nor did 90% of the characters and villains that she fought against. The way Drew turned into Spiderwoman was apocrophyl to the comics and a blatant copy of Wonder Woman! The spider bubble that allowed her to breathe under water and the spider telepathy that allowed her to speak to other spiders was unrelistic and untrue to the comic book adaptation of the character.

The episodes were for the most part subpar. There is very little reason to recommend them to either children or adults, save for two episodes I will go into detail with.

""The King Pin Strikes Again"" was perhaps the best episode of the series. Here we have a real villain from Marvel going up against Spiderwoman and he comes close to defeating her before Spiderwoman overcomes his attempts to extort her by revealing her secret identity. In this episode, the Kingpin is written as he was during the Animated 1967 Spiderman cartoon. The second best Spiderwoman episode called ""The Spiderwoman and the Fly"" deals with her origin. This episode was crafted quite well and showcased a new villain called The Human Fly. There was a ""Human Fly"" in the original Spiderwoman comic, but this character appears to be different from the one in the comic (Although I Could be Wrong As It Has Been Decades Since I Read The Spiderwoman Comic). There was a Human Fly in the 1967 Spiderman Cartoon too. This ""Fly"" was part of a duo of twin jewel thieves that were subsequently webbed up by Spiderman in their two meetings (See 1967 DVD).

The Human Fly that Jessica Drew tangles with is shrewd, cunning and intelligent. A former assistant scientist for her Father, he was able to deduce Jessica Drew to be the secret identity of Spiderwoman. He uses his dastardly abilities to take Jessica Drew's powers from her. But Jessica is no fool. Returning to her Father's old laboratory, she reads his notes and discovers how to brew the serum which originaly produced her powers. Once having injected herself with the serum she becomes Spiderwoman again. However, she brews a surprise for the mad scientist called Human Fly, and when she confronts him again he attempts to flee with his Human Fly speed. Unable to match this speed, Spiderwoman sets a trap! Spiderwoman spins a gigantic web in his path! At such a high rate of speed The Human Fly could not avoid the web! Entangled in its sticky strands, Spiderwoman crawls towards her helpless screaming quarry. Just like the saying: ""'Come into my parlor', said the spider to the fly,"" The Human Fly, hapless and ensnared by the clever Jessica Drew, can only watch helplessly as Spiderwoman sprays him with the same antidote he'd used to rob her of her powers. As he reverts to a mere mortal man, he says: ""I don't remember a thing."" Spiderwoman replies: ""You can remember in prison."" Wow, that's cold! Spiderwoman shows no mercy to her foes! Forcing a brainy scientist to go to prison is nothing short of a death sentence; had it been me I'd have been begging for her mercy.

The above two episodes are the best of the series. Some passable others would be the two where Spiderman makes a cameo appearance (""Pyramids of Terror""; ""The Kongo Spider""). Also see ""The Amazon Adventure"" and ""The Lost Continent,"" otherwise the other episodes of this short-lived series are duds. Still, if you like Spiderman and Spiderwoman, you might want to buy the DVD on the cheap. Unfortunately it is only available in Region 2 as of this writing, so it is important to make certain your DVD player is multi-regional.

8361187,3,B002BF42VU,"This is OK. Not as good as the Spiderman series of around the same era (late 70's early 80's). The main problem with this series is that Spiderwoman doesn't have recognizable and interesting villians to fight against. They pit her against mummies from outer space, Viking ghosts and other run of the mill monster villians. The only known villain in one episode is the Kingpin, who isn't exactly an exciting villain. The animation is naturally better than the 60's Marvel toons, so that's a plus, but the use of stock images is immense (the close up of Jessica Drew's face is always the same and always has this surprised/concerned look, which gets annoying). Also the stories are pretty bland and the use of ""Spider-sense"" (a psychic ability that tells her what is happening even over long distances in this cartoon) constantly is also annoying and not true to the original concept of Spider-Man's ""Spider-Sense"". Her powers are kind of stupid, including a ""Spider-Bubble"" that allows her to breath underwater. I do like the overall design of Spider-woman and think she looks cool, but this toon really doesn't do the character any justice. This would be one to add to your collection if you want all the Marvel Toons ever produced (just save it for close to last). To be fair, the U.S. hasn't taken animation making or writing seriously until later decades (starting in the 90's), unlike the Japanese who had interesting anime going back to the early 70's, so perhaps its unfair to be too critical of this production.",1474243200,,1518,4.842307692307692

8361189,5,B002BF42VU,"This is a great series from a great era of Marvel Cartoons.

Marvel created the character and cartoon in response to Filmation's Web Woman. And now she is very popular in the comics.

Guest stars include Spider-Man, The Kingpin, Dormammu, Dracula, The Monster Frankenstein, Werewolf By Night.

Spider-Woman faces aliens, monsters, mummies, giant spiders, robots and more.

This is not available in the US so requires a multi-region player, or a computer with a DVD drive running VLC.",1433376000,3,483,5.153846153846154
