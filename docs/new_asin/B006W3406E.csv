As with all IAMED performance DVDs, you'll feel as if you have the best seat in the theater, the stage and lighting is superb.  The quality of the dancers is top notched and this DVD features so many of the 'best of the best' in belly dance.  The  progression from one performance to another is smooth and exciting. And Leyla Jouvana certainly proves why she is called 'The Shimmy Queen"", her performance at the end inspired me to purchase her instructional DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/More-Shimmies-1000s-of-Variations/dp/B003679IO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">More Shimmies! & 1000s of Variations</a>

I have been watching a lot of youtube and had forgotten how much I was missing until I sat down and watched this DVD!  At times, Youtube can be like munching a box of fat free cookies, while they may fill you up, they can also leave you less then satisfied.  This DVD was like eating a meal that not only left me feeling satisfied and happy but it also inspired me. This DVD has the best of the best!  I highly recommend this DVD, especially if you need some inspiration for your next performance or if you want to have that feel of experiencing a real life performance!",1365292800,,1352,5.085972850678733
