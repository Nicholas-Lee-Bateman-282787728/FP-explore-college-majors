3699294,3,B001MT7ZK6,"On this DVD, Strawberry Shortcake has grown up and can drive a car...  and then travel around the world with her friends.  There are some new characters I'm not familiar with, such as Banana Candy, Peppermint, Tea Blossom and Tangerina to name a few.  Not my favorite Strawberry Shortcake DVD, but still berry cute and teaches positive messages.  So far my favorites are ""Berry Blossom Festival"" and ""Let's Dance"".  Overall, I would recommend this DVD for any Strawberry Shortcake fan.",1243036800,6,485,5.0125

8321720,4,B001MT7ZK6,"This is no better or worse than the other ""middle years"" Strawberry Shortcake videos, which all have relatively good story ideas, funny dance sequences, and amusingly well-developed musical scores by Andy Street, who clearly knows what he's doing. In the stories, the girls are always sort of fighting with each other, which will certainly give the dads a laugh and make it easier to watch the requisite 100s of times. Avoid the newer series, in which the characters all look, sound, and act the same and the music is bland.",1322956800,,524,4.833333333333333
