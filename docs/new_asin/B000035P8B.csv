3102345,1,B000035P8B,"I think it sucks that the Simpsons aren't going to be releasing anymore Dvd Copies of their seasons they haven't released so far on DvD. I don't think their streaming idea will work because I don't wanna use the Internet for it and I do not have cable to watch the full episodes on their website or see the old ones on T.V. I feel they should realease the DVD's because a lot of people prefer that also because of the complications with streaming and just feel great that they own a hard copy of it. I hope they really do realease season 18,19, etc. because it's a great series not just to watch, but to own also.",1484524800,,613,4.203389830508475

I can't use the Simpsons World App because I'm a totally blind Simpsons fan, and smartphone touch screens and I don't mix. Never mind the fact that you have to have the FX channel in order to enjoy the App. Come on, Fox. Release the rest of the show on DVD and I'll gladly shell out the cash for it.

I'm pretty willing to buy every season on dvd, even the less than great ones, because I grew up with the Simpsons and I love it.  It's my televised comfort food.

That being said, I don't have or want cable, and I want to own the movies and tv shows I care about.  If we're just renting them, they could go away at any time, or someone could do something stupid like monkeying with the aspext rations.

So fox is more or less driving me to piracy.  Get the other seasons off of bit torrent, burn the discs, and use photoshop to make an attractive box that matches the others.

Also, the Simpsons is just not the same without the audio commentary tracks.

3102385,1,B000035P8B,"I agree with the other people writing reviews here.  I was shocked to learn that there would be no more season sets of The Simpsons.  At first, I was in denial that this could even be possible, but after checking around on the internet, it seems that it is.  I don't have cable, so I can't watch the show there.  I don't have any type of streaming service at the moment either, but even if I did, that is NOT the same.  For one thing, you have to keep paying every month to have a streaming service, so the show would only be available to me so long as I'm willing to pay a monthly fee to keep the service.

Call me old fashioned, but I still like to own a physical copy of things like this.  I know that streaming and digital copies are all the rage nowadays, and I'll agree that they can be convenient at times, but it doesn't really feel like you own something that way.  Also, I've been somewhat disappointed with some of the digital copies of movies that I have on my computer.  Maybe it's my computer or my internet connection, but sometimes the picture and/or sound aren't the best.  Thankfully, I also own Blu-Rays of those same movies and they look and sound just fine once I put them in the player and watch them on an actual HDTV.

I'm hoping that FOX will change their mind on this one, but considering I went this long without even hearing about it, I fear that any outrage that is out there is fairly localized...  :(

I can't help but think that we wouldn't have had this problem if FOX could manage to release more than one season per year (at best) over all these years.",1449187200,,1587,4.232558139534884
3102386,1,B000035P8B,"As in the US The Simpsons were available in special boxsets (molded heads) I've been collecting since the first season was released.
Now I understood that FOX is not releasing any seasons 18, 19, (20 in a special edition?), 21 all the way upto 27 not on DVD (or Blu Ray).

Well FOX that is your loss! Apperantly you do NOT want to make any money, and from what I have seen there are a lot of people who want to spend their hard earned money on a serie we all love.

For myself and everyone else I can only ask not to restrict the purchase of The Simpsons to ""digital"" medium. FOX, you won't make as much money as you'd like, because most would like to have a physical copy.",1449100800,,673,4.129770992366412

French tv never broadcast the Simpsons in original english because they wanted to sell DVDs to fans I suppose. Now I won't be able to watch The Simpsons despite waving my money up in the air because the Discs stopped coming! And we never had the Blu-rays here.
And don't mention iTunes because the french Apple store is a desertic wasteland with 5 or 6 seasons available and they don't seem capable of writing in the menu of a season if the original language is available. And it's 35 uros I forgot. Yes 37,27 U$D.

Complete THE SIMPSONS series on DVD for those of us who bought every single season on DVD from the beginning. Streaming services are garbage and useless to collectors who want to own physical copies of each season. WE WANT THE SIMPSONS ON DVD! ON BLU-RAY! ON PHYSICAL MEDIA! Streaming services are not worth paying for. They cost nothing to print, nothing to package, nothing to ship. And offer nothing to collect or display. Trying to save money by releasing the show exclusively on-line will end up back firing on FOX. Fans buy multiple copies of the box sets in variant packaging. That's money FOX will be losing now.

How exactly does a website that only works in the United States, and only for people who happen to have FXX in their TV plan - which is rich since Fox think streaming is ""obsolescing"" broadcast TV - replace the dependability (ISP goofs and you don't have internet for a week? No problem), quality (wavering internet speed can't throttle the picture quality of a disc), and money-making potential ($20+ a season!) of a physical release?

I'll vote with my wallet, buying up the existing seasons while I still can while refusing to use the Simpsons World website. If that doesn't work, nothing will.",1435363200,,723,4.975206611570248
3102423,1,B000035P8B,"Not only am I a lifelong, die-hard fan of The Simpsons, I am also a shareholder of 21st Century Fox and I must say I'm very disappointed to hear that they are no longer making DVD/BluRay releases of The Simpsons.  I remember in one of Matt Groening's introductions (probably for Season 1) that they'd be releasing DVDs just in time for the next medium to come out.  It was a joke, but how sad to realize the joke has become the reality.  Amazing how often The Simpsons turns out to be prophetic.  What the television, movie, and music industry needs to realize is that there is a small but loyal population on THE PLANET that pays for and craves physical objects.  We are the new LIBRARIANS of the world and we have our collections of Books, DVDs, BluRays, and CDs, and yes, maybe even Vinyls, and we are proud of our collections!  Most of the time we pay a premium for those objects, but we do it willingly because we have the disposable income but because we know and appreciate the value of being able to hold the things in our hands the things that we hold dear in this world.

I have to assume that this is a business decision, but it's a bad business decision.  This is the worst Fox news since George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney, but that's another rant for another day!

I've also bought every other season that has been released and always looked forward to the newest season every December.

3102440,1,B000035P8B,"I agree with both of the previous reviewers thus far.  I collected every season of this show for 10 years since I was a 10 year old boy.  I even paid for seasons 21-26 on iTunes so I could have as many seasons of this show as I could.  Seasons 18 and 19 are, apparently, never going to be available on DVD or Blu-Ray.  Neither of the seasons are even available on iTunes or Amazon instant video.  I do not want to have to rely on an Internet connection every time I want to watch episodes of this show.  Even if they were to make every season of this show available via digital download, the audio and video quality cannot hold a candle to the quality Blu-Ray has to offer.  I feel like I have been deprived of the opportunity to own every episode of ""The Simpsons"" in its totality and in the best quality possible.  If this decision isn't final or irreversible, I beg the Fox corporation to reconsider.  They must realize just how many loyal fans there are who would buy every single season and episode of this show if they would just release them to the public and make them available for purchase in the quality of our choosing, be it DVD, digital download or Blu-Ray.  Please, please, please don't restrict access to ""The Simpsons"" to digital streaming you must pay for and will never truly permanently own in the way only physical mediums allow.

Okay, THE SIMPSONS, one of the best and longest running shows in t.v. history is now, apparently, no longer available to buy on dvd, or blu ray. I have dutifully, over the years, bought every single season on dvd. I never minded one single bit and I ALWAYS considered it money well spent. Every dime, well spent. Now, they wanna force me to buy it digitally, where I can only watch it if I have an internet connection, and I have to be willing to pay every single time I wanna watch an episode. I think not. I am NOT interested in watching THE SIMPSONS only if I have a good strong internet connection AND I don't want to be stuck in a situation where I pay for it and I SHOULD own it, but they have the right to re-edit the show, or take it away from me whenever they want.
I have no problems with blu rays and if they decided they wanted to not put it on dvd and go strictly blu ray, okay fine. I can do that. If they're not gonna let me have it and I can only have it with a strong internet connection and the condition they can swipe it away from me at any second, even if I pay for it and I'm supposed to own it, I DON'T WANT IT.

3102458,5,B000035P8B,"Amazing season!! This one is full of hits, such as Homerpalooza (with its appearances from Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill and Peter Frampton), Lisa The Iconoclast (with the guest voice of Donald Sutherland), and Two Bad Neighbours - where Homer battles George Bush Sr as Mikhail Gorbachev and Barb Bush look on (""I come to bring you present of warming of house, and I find you grappling with local oaf,"" says Mikhail - classic!!). Then there's the re-tread of the Tracey Ullman shorts (and unused segments) in the Simpsons' 138th Episode Spectacular clip show, the Itchy And Scratchy meet Fritz The Cat in The Day The Violence Died (including scenes from the first Itchy episode), the classic Pulp Fiction references in 22 Short Films About Springfield, classic scenes of Troy McLure in a musical version of Planet Of The Apes (with ""Rock Me Dr Zaeus"" to the beat of ""Rock Me Amadeus"") in A Fish Called Selma (which focuses on McLure), Nightmare on Elm Street caricature in Tree House Of Horror VI, and classic fisticuffs such as Homer/Smithers, Grandpa Simpson/Mister Burns, Homer/Bush, and so many others. There's also the first appearance of Bart and Lisa lookalikes Lester and Eliza, Disco Stu, and the true history of Jebediah Springfield. Lots of Phil Hartman in this season, which is great! Groundskeeper Willie recreating the classic Sharon Stone interrogation scene in Basic Instinct is sheer class. Love to see the family reunion of the Flanderseses (check out all the moustaches!!), and not just one but TWO references to McGuire Twins, who were the world's heaviest!! [Billy Leon McCrary (December 7, 1946 - July 14, 1979) and Benny Loyd McCrary (December 7, 1946 - March 26, 2001)], not to mention Young Grandpa Simpson (as a young boy in Ireland in one episode, and as Sargeant Simpson of the Fighting Hellfish in another), cameos by Doctor Who and from the Dragnet boys, a bizarre Bob Newhart trip, Bart's drivers license, Homer's name card (local man), Home a la R Crumb's Keep On Truckin', and so many more awesome moments.

One of the highlights of the season is probably Homer-3, the third Tree House Of Horror episode in this season's installmenbt, which shows Homer escaping the drawing board and becoming a three-dimensional image - first in the Tron sense, then... but that would be to give too much away. Seems that this was groundbreaking, and paved the way for computer animation (not sure if that's a good thing, but it's still cool to see how they did it).

Unfortunately, the extras to this DVD set are nothing special - about half of the episodes have deleted scenes, and each episode has a decent commentary track. But there are a few witty moments, like realising that the Simpsons staff writers who went to Lollapalooza to do background research for the Homerpalooza episode were really a bit out of their element (they called the festival organizer ""Eric Farrell"", rather than Perry Farrell). Some of the discs have animation showcases, sketch galleries, Disc 4 has a special language feature, and on Disc 1 there is a special bit for ""Homer In The Third Dimension"", and ""Paul and Linda's Lentil Soup"" recipe.

More awards such as the Annie Award for ""Best Animated Television Program"", Environmental Media Award for ""Best Television Episodic Comedy"", a Genesis Award for ""Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment"", and 2 Primetime Emmy Awards. Although ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" failed to win the Emmy, the ""Homer 3(cubed)"" segment was awarded the Ottawa International Animation Festival grand prize. The Simpsons also became the first animated series to win a Peabody Award for Exceptional Animation and Stinging Social Satire in this season. The celebs kept coming as well with such talents like Paul McCartney, Suzanne Somers, Jeff Goldblum, Christina Ricci, Smashing Pumkins, Cypress Hill and more.

 Some of the best episodes in this season include ""Two Bad Neighbors"" Where former President George Bush moves to Springfield across the street to the Simpsons. It doesn't take long for Bart to annoy the 41st  President resulting in Mr. Bush spanking Bart. Homer did not take this well and the two start to fued. This is also the first appearance of Disco Stu. ""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"" Yup. Bob is back and he has a nuke! Taking place at an air force show the Simpsons are attending, Bob escapes a chain gang on cleaning duty and finds himself at the same air show. (Of course it would be the same show!) Upon stealing a nucelar bomb and holding the town ransom, he demands that all television stations be taken off the air. Bart and Lisa soon discover that he is hiding out in a blimp and attempt to stop him. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" Bart gets caught shoplifting a video game and gets banned from the store. Marge finds out when they return to that store for a family photo. Ashamed, Bart feels like he is not Marge's special little guy anymore. ""Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'."" Grandpa Simpson actually tells the truth in one of his crazy stories and no one believes him until Burns smashes Bart's bedroom wall to steal Abe's key. Both set out to get the buried treasure that Abe and Mr. Burns Flying Hellfish squad hid long ago during the war. ""Homerpalooza"" Feeling old and not hip, Homer takes the kids to a music festival. He then ends up working for them as a sideshow freak that takes shots from a cannon to the gut. Homer becomes popular and has a show in Springfield, however a health risk arises and could become fatal. Also the season premiere of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?: Part 2"" revealing who was the culprit that shot Mr. Burns.

Special features include a sketch gallery, introduction from Matt Groening, deleted and extended Scenes with optional commentary, ""3D Homer"" featurette, Paul McCartney's Lentil Soup recipe, storyboards, and of course the awesome commentary track that is worth watching the season over again just for the commentary alone!",1389398400,,2864,4.874743326488707

3102498,4,B000035P8B,"This boxed set has some pretty good episodes. I especially like ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", especially the last segment, ""Bart Simpson's Dracula"". I think the bit when Lisa tells her parents ""Mr Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!"" and Mr Burns and Bart appear, I think it's so creepy because obviously Bart is a vampire, but he looks especially spooky. I do enjoy the bit when Bart and four other kids come to Lisa's bedroom window, then Bart says ""Come join us, Lisa, etc...Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here..."" and smashes her window. Then Lisa screams as Bart pushes her down onto her bed and his fangs extend and Lisa knows in a moment she will be a vampire too...it's my favourite bit. I also am fond of episodes that star Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob, ever since I watched ""Brother From Another Series"" (The episode where Bob reforms but Bart doesn't believe it) and ""Krusty Gets Busted"" (The first Sideshow Bob the villain episode). I especially couldn't wait to watch ""Cape Feare"".
BUY THIS DVD! You won't regret it, seriously.",1207180800,,1046,4.629032258064516
3102499,5,B000035P8B,"Every Simpsons fan has a favorite, hallmark season where the show peaked (and probably never returned to, or is ever likely to again), and mine is definitely season 7.  A lifelong fan of the show, I feel that the writing and animation styles reached the fever pitch of cleverness, subversiveness, and plain old Simpsonian style in this season, and declined shortly thereafter.  However the show may have suffered in recent seasons, it's runs like this, from 1995-96, that remind me why this show will always have a stranglehold on my own lexicion of pop culture references and in-jokes.

The highlight episodes in this season are hard for me to narrow down, but here are the ones that stand out in my mind.  ""Marge Be Not Proud"", ""Bart Sells His Soul"", ""Home Sweet Homediddly-dum-doodily"", ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2"", ""A Fish Called Selma"", all classics.  My personal favorite episode of all time, the guest-star studded ""Homerpalooza"" is the penultimate episode in this collection.  Even the clipshow is funny!  There are episodes on this season that I have watched literally a dozen times or more and still laugh at all the jokes time and again.  I should also point out that this season is well-written enough not to rely on my own sentimentality to force nostalgic chuckles...I laugh because the jokes are still funny NOW, not just because they were when I was in fifth grade when the episodes premiered.

I must confess that although I own all the seasons currently released on DVD, I very rarely take advantage of the special features or the writer commentary tracks.  I have no reason to suggest that these extras are any better or worse than you'd expect from previous or follow-up seasons.  For me, the fact that 25 episodes this great are compiled in one place is worth the price of entry.  I don't pay attention to the goodies, I definitely am not one to bitch about the plastic packaging...I just know that every disc on this season is guaranteed to make me laugh from start to finish.  What else do you expect from a comedy?

Bottom line time.  For many fans, the 'peak' years of the show arguably lasted from Season 3 through Season 7 or 8.  For me, the best episodes are surely toward the end of that run, and Season 7 stands as the undeniable summit for the show's still ongoing output.  This is a must-own for collectors or even casual fans, and if I found out a friend had never seen the show before (such phillistines do exist, it's true), I'd probably start with the cream of the crop from this season and work my way backwards. I know this review is a little on the boisterous side, but what can I say...it's the Simpsons. Can't recommend this enough.",1172534400,,2665,4.6481876332622605

3102502,4,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is still going (with 17 complete seasons and more new ones to come).  Watching the new episodes and comparing them with these Season 7 episodes show just how much the show has declined in density of story, laughs-per-minute, and heart.  The bright side is that the Simpsons are at the peak of their game in Seasons 4 through 8, and these DVDs take us back to the glory days of the show.  Even better, there are outtakes and deleted scenes aplenty for those that have seen these episodes numerous times.  There are many highlights in the season, my favourite episodes being:

Radioactive Man: Millhouse is cast as Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man film, being filmed in Springfield.  Contains what Matt Groenig claims is his favourite all-time Simpsons line ""The goggles!  They do nothing!""

Lisa the Vegetarian: Lisa goes veggie and gets less than total support from her family when Homer decides to put on Springfield's greatest BBQ.  ""Another whopper for the copper!""

King Size Homer: Homer deliberately gains weight to reach the level of ""morbidly obese"" so he can get on workman's compensation.  ""I think it's ironic that, for once, Dad's butt prevented the release of toxic gas.""

The Simpson's 138th Episode Spectacular: The greatest of the clips shows, because we get to see clips from the Tracy Ulman days and also scenes that were animated but cut before the show aired.  ""Release the robotic Richard Simmons!""

Two Bad Neighbours: An extended Dennis the Menace homage, with Bart as Dennis and former president George H.W. Bush as Mr. Wilson.  ""I come by to give you present for warming of house and find you grappling with local oaf!""

Lisa the Iconoclast: Lisa discovers that Jebediah Springfield was really a pirate.  With a brilliant guest-voicing by the most famous graduate of my very own high school - Donald Sutherland.  ""You are banned from this historical society!  You, and your children, and your children's children .... for 3 months.""

Homer the Smithers: Smithers goes on vacation and has Homer replace him as Mr. Burns's assistant so as to not be shown up.  Homer does so bad a job that Burns becomes self-sufficient and fires Smithers.  ""Mr. Smithers, I don't understand 1199 of my new duties!""

A Fish Called Selma: Troy McClure's career makes a startling comeback when he manages to quash rumours of his bizarre sex life by marrying a human female: Selma Bouvier.  ""It's the part I was born to play, baby!""  This episode features a commentary track with Jeff Goldblum, who guest-starred as Troy's agent.

22 Short Films About Springfield: Probably the most successful of the Simpson's attempts at being ""artsy.""  A series of short vignettes about the extended cast of Springfield, including the Comic Book Guy, Herman (the one-armed owner of the Army Surplus Store), Chief Wigum, Snake, Apu, etc.  ""For now I am going to party like it was on sale for $19.99!""

Summer of 4'2"": After Lisa realises how unpopular she is (no one wants to sign her yearbook), she tries to remake herself as a slacker tween when the family goes on vacation to the Flanders' beach house.  ""Celebrate the independence of your country by blowing up a small piece of it.""

As usual, this collection includes many deleted scenes (all collected together on the last disc, or you can watch them within each episode), a commentary on each-and-every episode, and the shows are unbutchered (unlike the syndicated versions you see on network TV).  The Marge head box is interesting, but not particularly practical (I, for one, couldn't ever get everything to fit back in it after opening it once).",1162425600,,3607,4.900990099009901

3102505,4,B000035P8B,"Again, this release fails to receive 5 stars based only on the packaging. When reviewing a product, content and container count equally! Especially in the case of this season, for which the more ""traditional"" packaging is available. I recommend that you go that route instead of this ""collector"" Marge head packaging.

As for the episodes themselves, the laughter continues right where it left off in Season 6. Many were disappointed in the unveiling of the culprit in Who Shot Mr. Burns, part 2. I, however, thought the episode was brilliant up to that point, and with the extra features giving you insight into the hundreds of subtleties pointing to the shooter (who shall remain unnamed in this review), it justifies the disappointing ending to the episode.

Other episodes I recommend are: Radioactive Man, Lisa the Vegetarian, Treehouse of Horror VI, Mother Simpson, Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming, Marge Be Not Proud, Team Homer, Two Bad Neighbors, Homer the Smithers, Short Films About Springfield, Homerpalooza. Without going into much detail about each one (you can probably check other reviews for full episode descriptions), suffice to say that each of these episodes is either packed with hilarity that will have you watching them repeatedly, or such a unique concept (Short Films and Two Bad Neighbors in particular) that they make this a more-than-enjoyable season to add to your collection.

Again, the special features include episode commentaries on each episode, as well as a few other featurettes. Some of them are well worth your time, others are just novelties that Simpsons creators insist on including for the extreme-diehard fans. If you do not own this season yet, do yourself a favour and go buy it! It's worth every penny, especially if you avoid the Marge head packaging!",1152144000,,1797,5.126279863481229

The other episodes that are really good are Lisa the vegetarian and Homer the smithers.  The rest of the episodes range from being generic to pretty good.  This is not my favorite season and I also had problems with the discs freezing and skipping.  I exchanged several times at the store I bought it from and it still has problems which is why I gave this three stars - and these episodes are not as funny as in the past.,1147910400,,521,4.18

3102522,5,B000035P8B,"If any of you are familiar with The Curmudgeon's other reviews, you may well be scratching your heads at this one. A FIVE star review?! That can't be right. And usually, YOU would be right. The Curmudgeon has dedicated 95 of his 100 reviews to bringing you the very worst things out there. To celebrate the 50 review milestone I reviewed 5 GREAT things that are available on Amazon, and so, now I've reached 100, I thought I'd do the same again. So, from reviews 100 - 105, it's going to be nothing but good, great and awesome stuff.

You can't help but adore The Simpsons. Sure, some of the more recent episodes are in danger of eating themselves in terms of ""wackiness"" and lack of character driven plot, but that aside, it's still the most consistently hilarious, satirical and downright ingenious program on television. Season Seven still sees them at their peak, with brilliant scripts and some genuinely touching moments. Just ignore the rubbish 3-D episode. Yuch.

It's when you really delve into Springfield you realise JUST how good a show The Simpsons really is. Has there ever been a show that has such a wide variety of fully fleshed, loveable characters that can co-exist outside of the main family? Think Mr Burns, Apu, Barney, Mo, Smithers, Patty and Selma, Groundskeeper Willie, Krusty, Skinner.. the list is ENDLESS. All these characters have quirks, catchphrases, identities and histories.. The Simpsons haven't created a TV show, they've pretty much created their own universe.

So this review isn't just for Season Seven. This review is in praise of The Simpsons itself - quite easily the greatest sitcom of all time. And as for the DVDs themselves? They are a fitting testament to the show; lovingly created, with commentaries for EVERY episode (sometimes the commentaries are better than the episodes themselves), and more extras than you'll ever know what to do with. These new collectable packaging (optional, of course) only serve as a reminder of how savvy and keyed-in to their audiences that Matt Groening et al really are.

3102527,5,B000035P8B,"To me, this is when The Simpsons really hit its stride. There is not a single weak episode in this collection (or the sixth season, either). It wasn't until season nine or ten that the show started to go downhill, and fast. As far as one reviewer's complaint about Lisa, I have to disagree. Lisa was always the conscience of the family, whether questioning her dad's morals in stealing cable or feeling the pain of Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II feeling ignored when the elephant moved in. In short, great season, great DVD's, and now for the standard question to FOX. When is season eight due to come out?",1140393600,,613,4.581818181818182
3102528,5,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is the greatest sitcom of all-time.  No question.  BUT, this is the season where it really started to drift from the formula.  And why?  One word: LISA.  The episode where she becomes a vegitarian was the start of the countless Lisa based, greenpeace, animal rights, civil unrest, seriousness that I really do not want when searching for entertainment.  It sort-of continued in ""Lisa the Iconoclast""

A message is OK, but Lisa was never anyone's favorite and it seemed like she was the vehicle for the writers to make a point.  The Simpsons, as all pure entertainment should be, used to be fundamentally pointless.  Political satire was used for humor, not necessarily to make a political statment.  And the show was satiracle of both the right and the left.  Something changed about that formula in this season.  There are more classic episodes in this collection than not though.  It was a great season.  But why did the writers feel they needed to shove Lisa down our throats at this point?

They also seemed to name drop with the cameos more after this season.  Instead of celebrities playing themselves they should play regular characters.  Except for the Rolling Stones and Athletes. :)

The Simpsons could go on for years if they just revert to the formula.  Humor should come first.  Alot of episodes after season seven (unlike previous seasons)where just boring and preachy.  I say back to the old ways!",1139961600,,1425,4.854166666666667

This has to be one of the most consistently funny shows out there, and the fact that they have been able to keep it as funny as they have for as long as they have is a testament to the high quality of the show, the actors, and the writers. Simply put, if you don't like The Simpsons, you won't like this, (and I wonder why you are wasting your time reading reviews for it,) but if you do like it, this season is great and I love having all these shows at hand to watch whenever I want - you will, too. I think it's a no-brainer. Enjoy!",1138665600,,595,3.8852459016393444
3102531,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh installment of one of the greatest animated series of all time features some of the most memorable episodes the crew of Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon ever produced. The storylines are exceptional in every episode, with non stop laughter from each episode. Also, to make the DVD completely worth your money, included is deleted scenes, commentary, and scenes shown in sketch form. As for the product getting 4.5 stars from me, I removed 0.5 stars for the very shoddy packaging. There is absolutely no excuse for it.

The season opens with the cliffhanger from Season 6 on who shot Mr. Burns. Although this has some great laughs, it doesn't do much for me personally since I've seen it way too many times. Classics flood this season, and included that mix has to be ""King-Size Homer"". Homer Simpson intentionally gains weight to qualify for disability and work at home. George Bush(it's not actually him) stars in ""Two Bad Neighbors"" as him and Homer fight because Mr. Bush spanked Bart. Lisa's vegetarianism is a highlight too, with Paul and Linda McCartney making a memorable appearance. One of my personal favourites is the episode featuring Abe Simpson as a member of the Flying Hellfish, up against Mr. Burns in a battle for German paintings. Perhaps the most significant moment of Season 7 is Homer venturing into the ""3rd Dimension"" in the Treehouse of Horror episode. The writers describe the enormous costs for the scene, and the animation is outstanding. ""22 Short Episodes About Springfield"" has some hilarious moments, most specifically when a very tall man humiliates Nelson Munts. Some more of my favourites include ""Summer of 4'2"", ""Homer The Smithers"", ""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly"" and ""Bart Sells His Soul"".

Overall, this is simply an extraordinary collection of amazing Simpsons episodes that any fan would love. I personally think the show is bad now, but they had some outstanding episodes, highlighted from Seasons 3-10, and these episodes all shine brightly in the mix of those seasons. Highly recommended for any fan of the TV show.",1138579200,,2088,5.031791907514451

3102533,5,B000035P8B,"For me, these are the best episodes that Matt Groening and Co. have ever come out with. They are so funny, but also, and i know this sounds wierd, they are actually really good stories. The animation looks its best (compared to the early seasons).

The case is brilliant, even the inside.

3102534,5,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons, while at its peak, was one of the funniest, smartest, heartwarming, and just plain fun shows out there.  It is sad that in recent years it has decided to try too hard to follow the footsteps of other shows, such as Family Guy and South Park instead of blazing its own creative trail.  During season 7 of the series, however, the Simpsons was still incredibly funny and original.  The episodes would often make you laugh, but would still deliver an overall positive moral message.  The characters were well-balanced within the Simpson family, with episodes not entirely revolving around Homer falling into crazy schemes.  The supporting characters were valuable to the situations and provided numerous laughs and gags.  If you want a fun, compelling and overall enjoyable experience, I strongly recommend this DVD.",1136937600,,827,5.134328358208955
3102535,5,B000035P8B,"I'd say if you had to get one dvd collection of the simpsons either buy this one, season 6 or wait for season 8. Why? Because these are the seasons when Springfield is in full swing. Unlike the first 4 seasons(and some episodes of the 5th) all the animation is smooth, and the humor really begins to take form. And unlike the later seasons (after season 9 or 10) the plots are still sensical and fresh. And the humor is as strong as ever.

But most of all in these episodes the Simspsons as characters really begin to take shape, as most of the plots are very character driven, they are touching yet still loaded with great jokes.

Homer has his wonderful classic oaf personality in ""King-sized homer"" and ""team homer"" and the touching episode where he meets his mother ""mother simpson"". Marge even gets a great episode that included fantastic satire about country clubs in ""scenes from the class struggle in Springfield"". Lisa begins to develop to rebel against american society in the classic episode ""Lisa the Vegeterian"", and ""Lisa the Iconoclast"" and Lisa's friendless social life is finally explored in ""Summer of 4 ft. 2"". Bart shines as a devil with a conscious in ""Bart sells his soul"" and ""marge be not proud"" and ""the curse of the flying hellfish"" which also develops the supporting character of Granpa, which was another great thing about season 7, it not only developed the simpsons as characters but the other inhabitants of Springfield such as Apu in ""much Apu about nothing"" and krusty in ""bart the fink"" and smithers and mr. burns in ""who shot mr. burns"" and one of my favorite episodes ""homer the smithers"" even geeky sidekick Millhouse got developed in the classic ""Radioactive man"" and the entire flanders family is fleshed out in one of my favorite episodes ""home sweet home diddly dum doodily"" . The entire town is featured in the genius experemental episode ""22 short films about Springfield"".

Still like every season it had it's clunkers such as this season's sideshow bob episode ""sideshow bob's last gleaming"" which was weak in comparison to all of the other sideshow bob episodes. And ""two bad neighbors"" was of lower quality(it seemed to foreshadow an episode from season 12 or 13.) But every season has it's downfalls, and still with 25 episodes( a large number in comparison to most seasons) you can expect a few bad ones.

So overall I'd have to say that this is one of the best Simpsons seasons yet and a must have for any simpsons fan... if you don't like it then you probably missed the satire... and shut up about the packaging... nobody cares.",1136592000,,2580,4.713968957871397

All of our favorite characters are still with us (mine are Mr. Burnes, Patti & Selma, Ralph Wiggium & Lisa Simpson). Matt Groneg (sp?) is still the creator, but as some reviewers have said, the simpsons have been through every scenerio-slice of life possible and then some, and all to often now are victims of pop culture-- (remember when Dustin Hoffman guest stared and they used another name?).

If Arrested Development gets cancelled, please Fox, please send some of the writers over to the Simpsons.",1134950400,,697,4.480314960629921
3102541,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh season of the Simpsons is a little low on laugh-out-loud hysteria, but the writing was still top notch, at least for most of the 25 episodes. But after the complete immortal brilliance of seasons 3 through 6, this season marks a real transition into the downfall years, starting with season 8, when the show really started to run out of ideas and get repetitive. Perhaps the biggest advancement in this particular season was a greater focus on the unity of the Simpson family, which is infinitely stronger and more realistic than the cheesy family values trumpeted by politicians and other frumps. This is most evident in ""Home Sweet Homediddly-dum-doodly"" (also a powerhouse for the Flanders family), ""Bart Sells His Soul,"" ""Marge Be Not Proud,"" and especially the Emmy-worthy ""Mother Simpson."" The production team was still working on important character developments this season as well, with the big winner being Lisa in both ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" and ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2."" We also get important advancements in the characters of Grampa in ""...'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'"" and Marge in ""Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield.""

Unfortunately, cracks in the Simpsons empire began to show this year &#8211; a foreshadowing of the mistakes of the next two or three seasons. ""Two Bad Neighbors,"" starring George H.W. Bush, is both a clunky use of a real-life person and it does serious damage to the continuity of the Simpsons universe. And the unfortunate trend of latching a storyline onto current events and then-popular people, a real source of trouble in future seasons, can be seen here in the badly dated ""Homerpalooza."" Meanwhile, ""King Size Homer"" marks the first time that the writers tackled a sensitive social issue but couldn't refrain from low blows and name-calling, resulting in a very problematic construction of a moral theme. However, some of this season's best episodes still maintain the madcap genius of the previous years (if in a slightly more subdued fashion), those being ""Homer the Smithers"" and ""Bart the Fink,"" among others. And there is a real advancement in experimental episode construction with the awesome ""22 Short Films About Springfield."" When all is said and done, this is still a great season for the Simpsons &#8211; and the last truly great season for a while. [~doomsdayer520~]",1134691200,,2345,5.090909090909091

Of course, I won't be content until I own ALL seasons of The Simpsons eventually, but the 7th season contains some of the most amusing episodes ever: like when George & Barbara Bush move across the street from the Simpson family; the Halloween episode with 3-D Homer (a classic!); the episode where Selma marries Troy McClure; the one with Marge's Channel suit; even the Homerpalooza episode. Trust me, this is one season you don't want to be without!",1134691200,,621,4.706422018348624
3102543,5,B000035P8B,"To start, season 7 of the Simpsons is available in two different packaging options. One is the Marge head, which is along the lines of the Homer shaped head packaging of the last set, and the other is the box form which is supposed to be along the lines of the previous five seasons. At first I had planned to buy the box form set, but after a friend purchased it before me, he clearly informed me to beware. The box form packaging of season 7 is exactly like the alternate packaging for season 6; it's simply a slip cover for what was inside the Homer head. Upon hearing this I decided to simply pick up the Marge head. While I wasn't crazy about the Homer head, I didn't mind it, and actually preferred it to the slip cover. Whether you buy the Marge head or go with the Slip cover casing, one thing is certain: What's inside the head is the good stuff.

Seasons 4-8 were arguably when the Simpsons hit their stride. While I'm still fond of season 3 as well, it's hard to argue against any of these episodes. I don't want to go into great detail about all the episodes or give a plot synopsis for each one, because if you would like that, there are spotlight reviews to help you. However season 7 contains some of my personal favorite episodes, including the conclusion to ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" (which has my all time favorite simpson's quote by Officer Wiggum, where he says Homer is under arrest for the attempted murder of Mr. Burns, Homer yells ""Doh!"" and then Wiggum says ""Yea that's what they all say, Doh.""), Bart selling his soul to Milhouse for $5, Milhouse getting the part as Fall Out Boy in the Radioactive Man Movie, Sideshow Bob returning to threaten Springfield with a weapon of mass destruction, and the Treehouse Of Horror VI episode (best besides Treehouse of Horror II in season 3). Really every episode in this season has its own charm, but these just happen to be my favorites. As usual the extras are a great addition to the set. You get the usual commentaries on every episode, featurettes, deleted scenes, and many more things that have never been available before now. Fox also seems to be getting the sets out quicker (season 6 in August, season 7 in December, fastest period between releases yet) so we can only hope that we have season 8 resting in our hands fairly soon.

If you're a fan of the Simpsons, most likely you're going to be very pleased with this set. There's plenty of great and memorable episodes found on this set, to go along with the great extras that have been included. The writing was witty, the jokes were entertaining, and the animation was great, and that all makes season 7 a great addition to a Simpsons' fan's collection. While it might not be the best overall season the show has seen (and there are going to be ongoing disputes for eternity on which one that is) it's definitely on par with any of the stellar seasons 4-8.

What's so funny about Homer in 3D?  Yes, the animation was good, but the episode just wasn't funny.  The Sideshow Bob episode was awful.  The Homerpalooza episode also missed the mark.  And even the conclusion of the ""Who shot Mr Burns episode"" was clever, but let's be honest, was it laugh out loud funny?  The answer is NO.  And someone please tell me why they even made ""22 Short Films about Springfield"".

Of course there were some great episodes in Season 7: Homer's Bowling team, Homer gaining weight until he weighed 300 pounds and had to work from home, former President Bush moving in next door.  Please note that I am not trying to dissuade anyone from buying Season 7, but if one decides to buy all 17 (and counting) seasons of The Simpsons, you're looking at a pretty substantial investment.  It pains me to say this, but even for diehard fans like me who have never missed an episode, from here on in, it may be smart and pick and choose which season's to buy.

Each season just gets better and better!

Even though I have to anxiously wait for christmas to recieve this as a gift from Santa.

Love the one where bart gets a fake ID and drive himself and his friends to the former worlds fair and then their car gets wrecked from knocking over the suns sphere. That was hilarious!

I also love the one with Troy McClore playing as Dr. Zeaus in Planet of the Apes. I have that song on soundtrack. (GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME YOU DIRTY APE!!)

3102554,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh season of the Simpsons saw Matt Groening's prime time, brilliantly hilarious animated series not missing a single step.  As this season opens, we learn who shot Mr. Burns (and honestly, who didn't see it coming?), and everything from that point forward is nothing but memorable, whimsical, and often insane humor that only the Simpsons could bring.  Also in this season, Hollywood comes to Springfield to film a Radioactive Man movie, and Millhouse ends up getting cast as sidekick Fallout Boy (""Radioactive Man""), Homer and Marge get accused of being negligent parents and Bart, Lisa, and Maggie get sent to live with the Flanders' (""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly""), Bart sells his soul for five dollars (""Bart Sells His Soul""), Lisa becomes a vegetarian after attending a petting zoo (""Lisa the Vegetarian"", which also features Paul and the late Linda McCartney as themselves), Homer becomes morbidly obese so he doesn't have to go to work (""King-Size Homer""), Homer is re-united with his long lost mother (voiced by Glenn Close in ""Mother Simpson""), Sideshow Bob returns with a vendetta against television (""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming""), former President George Bush moves next door (the hilarious and unpredictable ""Two Bad Neighbors""), Bart meets the real creator of Itchy & Scratchy (voiced by Kirk Douglas in ""The Day the Violence Died""), Pulp Fiction gets hilariously spoofed (""22 Short Films About Springfield""), and Homer becomes a sideshow freak after going to Lolapalooza (""Homerpalooza"", which also features the Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Peter Frampton).  The ""Treehouse of Horror"" special this season was also a memorable smash, climaxing with Homer's unforgettable journey into the 3-D world.  ""The Simpsons 138th Show Spectacular"" is a real gem, hosted by Troy McClure (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman) as we the viewer are treated to rarely seen early takes of the characters, alternate endings, and deleted scenes that never saw the light of day, as well as some hidden messages and trivia as well.  All in all, just like all the early seasons of the Simpsons, you can't go wrong with the seventh season, and it's pure animated lunacy at it's very best.  Let's just hope that the packaging is much better than the incredibly poorly designed Homer head shaped package that contained season six.",1131321600,,2347,5.212201591511937

The first episode will bring us one of the greatest ones ever; we will be able to discover who shot Mr. Burns in the sequel of: WHO SHOT MR. BURNS?

In the middle of the season, TREEHOUSE OF HORROR VI has the famous short in which Homer converts himself in a three dimension figure.

Another good episode among others in this season is the one called 22 SHORT FILMS ABOUT SPRINFIELD, a very dynamic episode made to be one of the best ""screenplays"" from the writers of the show.

The best thing that happen this time when the DVD comes out in December is that we will have the ability to choose the box and hopefully this will end those endless and tiresome discussions about FOX inability to do proper marketing.

3102560,5,B000035P8B,"Season 9s episode Trash Of The Titans is a classic. Probably one of my favorites. Okay  like everyone it is just because of the Garbageman Can song paroding The Candyman Can. To make a long story short, best episode ever.",1086566400,,221,4.525
3102561,5,B000035P8B,"These Are 6 of the best episodes of The Simpsons available
on three tapes.
DVD sets are coming out but, they have not got to the seasons
which these episodes are from
This is my second favorite Simpsons episode of all time.
First off, In a spoof of Gremlins and Child's Play.
Homer buys a killer doll for bart that tries to kill him.
And boy is it hilarious.
Next is Ape Island which is a take off on King Kong.
Homer is King Kong and you can see how funny this will be.
Dial Z for zombie follows. Dawn of the Dead in Springfield is what you are getting and I just can'r get enough.
Some of the best lines ever are in this one fragment of an episode. As homer forgets to seal off the doors to the house
and Flanders is a zombie. Classic.
Second Episode: My Favorite Simpsons Episode Ever.
Is The Simpsons verion of Stephen King's The Shining.
As Bart can read Groundskeeper Willies mind. And Homer
goes mad and tries to kill the family because no beer and no
TV make Homer go crazy. What a gem
Now for my Favorite ""Time and Punishment"" Now first off I love
time travel stories and movies. And the way the poke fun at the
silliness of it all here is top notch. Homer builds a time machine out of a toaster and goes back to pre-historic times
and changes the future by sneezing and sitting on a fish.
When he comes back Ned Flanders is Ruler of the world.
Oh I love this.
Now to Nightmare Cafeteria. Which is bascially Soylent Green.
As kids in Springfield are cooked up in the school cafeteria.
great.
Tape 2: Bart Sells his soul to Milhouse who in turn trades it for ALF pogs. This episode is great as Moe opens a family resteraunt.
Next is Lisa the Skeptic which is a very good episode that
touches on the question of science vs religion vs corporation.
Very apocalyptic yet in a very silly way. I love this episode.
Tape 3: Two Sideshow Bob Episodes
First Bob is in prison and gets out because of a radio talk show
host ""Rush Limbaugh"" is who he is supposed to be. He then runs
for office and rigs the election. Lisa and Bart discover this.
Funny episode.
Last is Cape Feare where The Simpsons go in witness protection.
As Sideshow Bob is after bart. The funniest part about this episode is Bart is scared he will die and Homer keeps busting in the room like "" Hey bart checkout my new chainsaw"" it is
very funny. all in all
If you love The Simpsons like I Do. GO ahead and get this.
DVD's are coming really slow.",1084492800,,2415,4.206896551724138
3102562,5,B000035P8B,"This is a hilariously entertaining set of videos that center around the Halloween specials, such as ""The Shinning."" This is where Homer turns crazy when he discovers that television and beer are unavailable at the creepy hotel. Other classic episodes are included, which are guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.",998870400,,313,5.1568627450980395
3102563,5,B000035P8B,"You don't really expect me to start writing generally about the Simpsons, do you? Because there's really no point to it. The Simpsons is simply the best TV comedy of all times, period. To explain why would take much, much more than a 1000 words. And this particular tape contains two of the funniest Simpsons episodes ever, both of them featuring Kelsey Grammer as the manic Sideshow Bob. I am not really a fan of 'Frasier', but Grammer IS a great actor, and prsonally I think that Sideshow Bob is his best character.
Although 'Krusty Gets Busted', the episode that introduced Bob, is missing, Bob's two funniest appearences are here. 'Black Widower', a truly unforgettable episode from the show's 3rd season, is incredibly funny, especially the last five minutes. Even funnier is 'Cape Feare' from season 5, revolving around Bob's attempts to kill Bart Simpson, and featuring brilliant parodies on classic horror films like 'Cape Fear' and 'Psycho'. Both are exceptionally good episodes from an excepitol(d'oh!)ly good series.",994032000,,1027,5.119047619047619

3102565,5,B000035P8B,"I just recieved my ""Trick or Treehouse"" collection a week or two ago. It has a truely wonderful selection of Simpsons videos. Although only one of these three videos are Halloween specials as the sets name can make you think the other two can also relate to the somewhat creepy theme of the set. The Halloween video has some of my favorite Treehouse of Horrors episodes with Treehouse of Horrors 3 and 5. Springfield Murder Mysterys brings back the memory of Sideshow Bob and his murderous attemps for revenge when he attemps to murder Aunt Selma and tries once again to kill Bart. And in the final video ""Heaven and Hell"" Bart sells his soul to Millhouse for five dollars and must find it in his religon and in himself to find his soul and learn what his soul is to him and when Lisa finds what looks to be the skeleton of an angel she is left alone to prove to the town that it isn't really an angel, but what will happen at sundown?",983318400,,935,4.318181818181818
3102566,5,B000035P8B,"This set contains some of the best episodes in the Simpson's history.  Cape Feare is my personal favorite.  Both of the Halloween episodes are classics, especially ""The Shinning"".  The ""Heaven and Hell"" tape is good, but not quite what the other two are.  This is definitely a must for any Simpsons fan.",978480000,,303,4.769230769230769
3102567,4,B000035P8B,"These are some good episodes, the Side Show Bob (2) ones alone almost justify the price.  The Halloween specials are #'s II and V for some reason. Until you can buy more than two episodes per tape at a time, this is one box set worth having.",975888000,,241,4.127659574468085
3102568,4,B000035P8B,"Heaven and Hell is a fantastic tape of the hilarious, clever, animated satire, ""The Simpsons.""  The first episode in this entry is appropriately titled, ""Bart Sells His Soul."" It is filled with many subtle but wonderful jokes.  Bart sells his soul to his friend Milhouse for $5.00, believing it does not exist.  He soon goes to great lengths to retrieve it as he faces many unexpected problems and complications without it.  In this episode there is also a hilarious subplot wherein Moe converts his lowly bar into a wholesome family restaurant in the hopes of making more money. This subplot hilariously satires popular family restaurants.  The name of his restaurant alone evokes laughs(Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag).  A series fan will be very impressed with this very bright episode. The second episode, ""Lisa the Skeptic,"" is equally comical.  Lisa unearths a skeleton that bares a striking resemblance to an angel. All the townspeople believe it is an angel with the exception of Lisa who belives it is fake. The townspeople quickly become obssessed with it. Some of the funniest scenes in this episode are the ones with Homer trying to make money off the supposed angel.  There are many jokes in this episode about the debate of religion vs. science which are not offensive but are rather very creative and witty.  Also, the final plot twist in this episode was very unpredictable but well thought out and completely satisfying for the viewer.  Matt Groening, the creator of ""The Simpsons,"" should be proud of himself for releasing another Simpsons tape that will delight people across the country and cause them to laugh uncontrollably.  This tape is recommended to anyone who likes comic relief and will make Simpson fans out of many new viewers.",974160000,,1753,4.989690721649485

3102570,2,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is the hippest, funniest animated series, bar-none, but I have a couple of complaints about this set. First, why only two episodes per tape? At 22 minutes per show, why not put three or four on a tape? Second, why call it the Treehouse of Horrors Gift Set if only two out of the six episodes included are Treehouse of Horrors? That seems terribly misleading to me, and the Amazon.com reviewer did well to advise the customers of this fact.
If this were actually a set of Treehouse of Horror eps I-IX, three eps per tape, I would buy it in a second. As it stands, I will not buy this set, and can't recommend it, as much as I love the Simpsons.",972777600,,656,4.256

That being said, I don't have or want cable, and I want to own the movies and tv shows I care about.  If we're just renting them, they could go away at any time, or someone could do something stupid like monkeying with the aspext rations.

So fox is more or less driving me to piracy.  Get the other seasons off of bit torrent, burn the discs, and use photoshop to make an attractive box that matches the others.

3336882,1,B000035P8B,"I agree with the other people writing reviews here.  I was shocked to learn that there would be no more season sets of The Simpsons.  At first, I was in denial that this could even be possible, but after checking around on the internet, it seems that it is.  I don't have cable, so I can't watch the show there.  I don't have any type of streaming service at the moment either, but even if I did, that is NOT the same.  For one thing, you have to keep paying every month to have a streaming service, so the show would only be available to me so long as I'm willing to pay a monthly fee to keep the service.

Call me old fashioned, but I still like to own a physical copy of things like this.  I know that streaming and digital copies are all the rage nowadays, and I'll agree that they can be convenient at times, but it doesn't really feel like you own something that way.  Also, I've been somewhat disappointed with some of the digital copies of movies that I have on my computer.  Maybe it's my computer or my internet connection, but sometimes the picture and/or sound aren't the best.  Thankfully, I also own Blu-Rays of those same movies and they look and sound just fine once I put them in the player and watch them on an actual HDTV.

I'm hoping that FOX will change their mind on this one, but considering I went this long without even hearing about it, I fear that any outrage that is out there is fairly localized...  :(

I can't help but think that we wouldn't have had this problem if FOX could manage to release more than one season per year (at best) over all these years.",1449187200,,1587,4.232558139534884

Well FOX that is your loss! Apperantly you do NOT want to make any money, and from what I have seen there are a lot of people who want to spend their hard earned money on a serie we all love.

I remember in one of Matt Groening's introductions (probably for Season 1) that they'd be releasing DVDs just in time for the next medium to come out.  It was a joke, but how sad to realize the joke has become the reality.  Amazing how often The Simpsons turns out to be prophetic.  What the television, movie, and music industry needs to realize is that there is a small but loyal population on THE PLANET that pays for and craves physical objects.  We are the new LIBRARIANS of the world and we have our collections of Books, DVDs, BluRays, and CDs, and yes, maybe even Vinyls, and we are proud of our collections!  Most of the time we pay a premium for those objects, but we do it willingly because we have the disposable income but because we know and appreciate the value of being able to hold the things in our hands the things that we hold dear in this world.

Fox's explanation of ""it's on tv, it's on the internet, blah blah blah"", holds the person who likes to collect items such as this, and say that you own a copy.

I chose the cardboard box version.  then when season 6 was released to MATCH the rest of my collection I bought it and tossed the homer plastic head!  THANKS FOR NOTHING FOX!!!

I feel gypped since I collected all the season since it has come out on DVD.  I DO NOT STREAM FROM THE COMPUTER.  Hopefully Mr. Jean or FOX will wise up and start putting THE SIMPSONS back on DVD.

You don't treat fans like crap because they will turn away, all of those people who watched fox shows usually were waiting for The Simpsons to start.

3336936,1,B000035P8B,"Just adding my voice to those who have posted before me. I've also bought every other season that has been released and always looked forward to the newest season every December. I hate the idea of being forced to another media source which is completely inconvenient and unreliable, as others have already pointed out. It would've been nice if they would at least give us seasons 18 &19 to balance out our ALMOST complete collection!!",1431561600,,435,4.8133333333333335
3336937,1,B000035P8B,"I agree with both of the previous reviewers thus far.  I collected every season of this show for 10 years since I was a 10 year old boy.  I even paid for seasons 21-26 on iTunes so I could have as many seasons of this show as I could.  Seasons 18 and 19 are, apparently, never going to be available on DVD or Blu-Ray.  Neither of the seasons are even available on iTunes or Amazon instant video.  I do not want to have to rely on an Internet connection every time I want to watch episodes of this show.  Even if they were to make every season of this show available via digital download, the audio and video quality cannot hold a candle to the quality Blu-Ray has to offer.  I feel like I have been deprived of the opportunity to own every episode of ""The Simpsons"" in its totality and in the best quality possible.  If this decision isn't final or irreversible, I beg the Fox corporation to reconsider.  They must realize just how many loyal fans there are who would buy every single season and episode of this show if they would just release them to the public and make them available for purchase in the quality of our choosing, be it DVD, digital download or Blu-Ray.  Please, please, please don't restrict access to ""The Simpsons"" to digital streaming you must pay for and will never truly permanently own in the way only physical mediums allow.

3336938,1,B000035P8B,"I would not even wanna rate this even ONE star. Okay, THE SIMPSONS, one of the best and longest running shows in t.v. history is now, apparently, no longer available to buy on dvd, or blu ray. I have dutifully, over the years, bought every single season on dvd. I never minded one single bit and I ALWAYS considered it money well spent. Every dime, well spent. Now, they wanna force me to buy it digitally, where I can only watch it if I have an internet connection, and I have to be willing to pay every single time I wanna watch an episode. I think not. I am NOT interested in watching THE SIMPSONS only if I have a good strong internet connection AND I don't want to be stuck in a situation where I pay for it and I SHOULD own it, but they have the right to re-edit the show, or take it away from me whenever they want.
I have no problems with blu rays and if they decided they wanted to not put it on dvd and go strictly blu ray, okay fine. I can do that. If they're not gonna let me have it and I can only have it with a strong internet connection and the condition they can swipe it away from me at any second, even if I pay for it and I'm supposed to own it, I DON'T WANT IT.
I wish someone from Fox would read this and if, this December, it's announced that season 18 comes out on dvd with the good bonus features that we SIMPSONS fans all know and love, then they made a sale. Other than that, I'm done.",1429747200,,1412,3.9753521126760565

3336955,5,B000035P8B,"Amazing season!! This one is full of hits, such as Homerpalooza (with its appearances from Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill and Peter Frampton), Lisa The Iconoclast (with the guest voice of Donald Sutherland), and Two Bad Neighbours - where Homer battles George Bush Sr as Mikhail Gorbachev and Barb Bush look on (""I come to bring you present of warming of house, and I find you grappling with local oaf,"" says Mikhail - classic!!). Then there's the re-tread of the Tracey Ullman shorts (and unused segments) in the Simpsons' 138th Episode Spectacular clip show, the Itchy And Scratchy meet Fritz The Cat in The Day The Violence Died (including scenes from the first Itchy episode), the classic Pulp Fiction references in 22 Short Films About Springfield, classic scenes of Troy McLure in a musical version of Planet Of The Apes (with ""Rock Me Dr Zaeus"" to the beat of ""Rock Me Amadeus"") in A Fish Called Selma (which focuses on McLure), Nightmare on Elm Street caricature in Tree House Of Horror VI, and classic fisticuffs such as Homer/Smithers, Grandpa Simpson/Mister Burns, Homer/Bush, and so many others. There's also the first appearance of Bart and Lisa lookalikes Lester and Eliza, Disco Stu, and the true history of Jebediah Springfield. Lots of Phil Hartman in this season, which is great! Groundskeeper Willie recreating the classic Sharon Stone interrogation scene in Basic Instinct is sheer class. Love to see the family reunion of the Flanderseses (check out all the moustaches!!), and not just one but TWO references to McGuire Twins, who were the world's heaviest!! [Billy Leon McCrary (December 7, 1946 - July 14, 1979) and Benny Loyd McCrary (December 7, 1946 - March 26, 2001)], not to mention Young Grandpa Simpson (as a young boy in Ireland in one episode, and as Sargeant Simpson of the Fighting Hellfish in another), cameos by Doctor Who and from the Dragnet boys, a bizarre Bob Newhart trip, Bart's drivers license, Homer's name card (local man), Home a la R Crumb's Keep On Truckin', and so many more awesome moments.

One of the highlights of the season is probably Homer-3, the third Tree House Of Horror episode in this season's installmenbt, which shows Homer escaping the drawing board and becoming a three-dimensional image - first in the Tron sense, then... but that would be to give too much away. Seems that this was groundbreaking, and paved the way for computer animation (not sure if that's a good thing, but it's still cool to see how they did it).

Unfortunately, the extras to this DVD set are nothing special - about half of the episodes have deleted scenes, and each episode has a decent commentary track. But there are a few witty moments, like realising that the Simpsons staff writers who went to Lollapalooza to do background research for the Homerpalooza episode were really a bit out of their element (they called the festival organizer ""Eric Farrell"", rather than Perry Farrell). Some of the discs have animation showcases, sketch galleries, Disc 4 has a special language feature, and on Disc 1 there is a special bit for ""Homer In The Third Dimension"", and ""Paul and Linda's Lentil Soup"" recipe.

More awards such as the Annie Award for ""Best Animated Television Program"", Environmental Media Award for ""Best Television Episodic Comedy"", a Genesis Award for ""Best Television Comedy Series, Ongoing Commitment"", and 2 Primetime Emmy Awards. Although ""Treehouse of Horror VI"" failed to win the Emmy, the ""Homer 3(cubed)"" segment was awarded the Ottawa International Animation Festival grand prize. The Simpsons also became the first animated series to win a Peabody Award for Exceptional Animation and Stinging Social Satire in this season. The celebs kept coming as well with such talents like Paul McCartney, Suzanne Somers, Jeff Goldblum, Christina Ricci, Smashing Pumkins, Cypress Hill and more.

 Some of the best episodes in this season include ""Two Bad Neighbors"" Where former President George Bush moves to Springfield across the street to the Simpsons. It doesn't take long for Bart to annoy the 41st  President resulting in Mr. Bush spanking Bart. Homer did not take this well and the two start to fued. This is also the first appearance of Disco Stu. ""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming"" Yup. Bob is back and he has a nuke! Taking place at an air force show the Simpsons are attending, Bob escapes a chain gang on cleaning duty and finds himself at the same air show. (Of course it would be the same show!) Upon stealing a nucelar bomb and holding the town ransom, he demands that all television stations be taken off the air. Bart and Lisa soon discover that he is hiding out in a blimp and attempt to stop him. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" Bart gets caught shoplifting a video game and gets banned from the store. Marge finds out when they return to that store for a family photo. Ashamed, Bart feels like he is not Marge's special little guy anymore. ""Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'."" Grandpa Simpson actually tells the truth in one of his crazy stories and no one believes him until Burns smashes Bart's bedroom wall to steal Abe's key. Both set out to get the buried treasure that Abe and Mr. Burns Flying Hellfish squad hid long ago during the war. ""Homerpalooza"" Feeling old and not hip, Homer takes the kids to a music festival. He then ends up working for them as a sideshow freak that takes shots from a cannon to the gut. Homer becomes popular and has a show in Springfield, however a health risk arises and could become fatal. Also the season premiere of ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?: Part 2"" revealing who was the culprit that shot Mr. Burns.

Special features include a sketch gallery, introduction from Matt Groening, deleted and extended Scenes with optional commentary, ""3D Homer"" featurette, Paul McCartney's Lentil Soup recipe, storyboards, and of course the awesome commentary track that is worth watching the season over again just for the commentary alone!",1389398400,,2864,4.874743326488707

3336995,4,B000035P8B,"This boxed set has some pretty good episodes. I especially like ""Treehouse of Horror IV"", especially the last segment, ""Bart Simpson's Dracula"". I think the bit when Lisa tells her parents ""Mr Burns is a vampire, and he has Bart!"" and Mr Burns and Bart appear, I think it's so creepy because obviously Bart is a vampire, but he looks especially spooky. I do enjoy the bit when Bart and four other kids come to Lisa's bedroom window, then Bart says ""Come join us, Lisa, etc...Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here..."" and smashes her window. Then Lisa screams as Bart pushes her down onto her bed and his fangs extend and Lisa knows in a moment she will be a vampire too...it's my favourite bit. I also am fond of episodes that star Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob, ever since I watched ""Brother From Another Series"" (The episode where Bob reforms but Bart doesn't believe it) and ""Krusty Gets Busted"" (The first Sideshow Bob the villain episode). I especially couldn't wait to watch ""Cape Feare"".

3336996,5,B000035P8B,"Every Simpsons fan has a favorite, hallmark season where the show peaked (and probably never returned to, or is ever likely to again), and mine is definitely season 7.  A lifelong fan of the show, I feel that the writing and animation styles reached the fever pitch of cleverness, subversiveness, and plain old Simpsonian style in this season, and declined shortly thereafter.  However the show may have suffered in recent seasons, it's runs like this, from 1995-96, that remind me why this show will always have a stranglehold on my own lexicion of pop culture references and in-jokes.

The highlight episodes in this season are hard for me to narrow down, but here are the ones that stand out in my mind.  ""Marge Be Not Proud"", ""Bart Sells His Soul"", ""Home Sweet Homediddly-dum-doodily"", ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2"", ""A Fish Called Selma"", all classics.  My personal favorite episode of all time, the guest-star studded ""Homerpalooza"" is the penultimate episode in this collection.  Even the clipshow is funny!  There are episodes on this season that I have watched literally a dozen times or more and still laugh at all the jokes time and again.  I should also point out that this season is well-written enough not to rely on my own sentimentality to force nostalgic chuckles...I laugh because the jokes are still funny NOW, not just because they were when I was in fifth grade when the episodes premiered.

I must confess that although I own all the seasons currently released on DVD, I very rarely take advantage of the special features or the writer commentary tracks.  I have no reason to suggest that these extras are any better or worse than you'd expect from previous or follow-up seasons.  For me, the fact that 25 episodes this great are compiled in one place is worth the price of entry.  I don't pay attention to the goodies, I definitely am not one to bitch about the plastic packaging...I just know that every disc on this season is guaranteed to make me laugh from start to finish.  What else do you expect from a comedy?

Bottom line time.  For many fans, the 'peak' years of the show arguably lasted from Season 3 through Season 7 or 8.  For me, the best episodes are surely toward the end of that run, and Season 7 stands as the undeniable summit for the show's still ongoing output.  This is a must-own for collectors or even casual fans, and if I found out a friend had never seen the show before (such phillistines do exist, it's true), I'd probably start with the cream of the crop from this season and work my way backwards. I know this review is a little on the boisterous side, but what can I say...it's the Simpsons. Can't recommend this enough.",1172534400,,2665,4.6481876332622605
3336997,5,B000035P8B,My son being such a huge Simpsons fan - loved this DVD.  It just added to the collection.  What can you say about such a popular item...it is what it is for him...GREAT!,1167955200,,169,4.090909090909091

3336999,4,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is still going (with 17 complete seasons and more new ones to come).  Watching the new episodes and comparing them with these Season 7 episodes show just how much the show has declined in density of story, laughs-per-minute, and heart.  The bright side is that the Simpsons are at the peak of their game in Seasons 4 through 8, and these DVDs take us back to the glory days of the show.  Even better, there are outtakes and deleted scenes aplenty for those that have seen these episodes numerous times.  There are many highlights in the season, my favourite episodes being:

Radioactive Man: Millhouse is cast as Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man film, being filmed in Springfield.  Contains what Matt Groenig claims is his favourite all-time Simpsons line ""The goggles!  They do nothing!""

Lisa the Vegetarian: Lisa goes veggie and gets less than total support from her family when Homer decides to put on Springfield's greatest BBQ.  ""Another whopper for the copper!""

King Size Homer: Homer deliberately gains weight to reach the level of ""morbidly obese"" so he can get on workman's compensation.  ""I think it's ironic that, for once, Dad's butt prevented the release of toxic gas.""

The Simpson's 138th Episode Spectacular: The greatest of the clips shows, because we get to see clips from the Tracy Ulman days and also scenes that were animated but cut before the show aired.  ""Release the robotic Richard Simmons!""

Two Bad Neighbours: An extended Dennis the Menace homage, with Bart as Dennis and former president George H.W. Bush as Mr. Wilson.  ""I come by to give you present for warming of house and find you grappling with local oaf!""

Lisa the Iconoclast: Lisa discovers that Jebediah Springfield was really a pirate.  With a brilliant guest-voicing by the most famous graduate of my very own high school - Donald Sutherland.  ""You are banned from this historical society!  You, and your children, and your children's children .... for 3 months.""

Homer the Smithers: Smithers goes on vacation and has Homer replace him as Mr. Burns's assistant so as to not be shown up.  Homer does so bad a job that Burns becomes self-sufficient and fires Smithers.  ""Mr. Smithers, I don't understand 1199 of my new duties!""

A Fish Called Selma: Troy McClure's career makes a startling comeback when he manages to quash rumours of his bizarre sex life by marrying a human female: Selma Bouvier.  ""It's the part I was born to play, baby!""  This episode features a commentary track with Jeff Goldblum, who guest-starred as Troy's agent.

22 Short Films About Springfield: Probably the most successful of the Simpson's attempts at being ""artsy.""  A series of short vignettes about the extended cast of Springfield, including the Comic Book Guy, Herman (the one-armed owner of the Army Surplus Store), Chief Wigum, Snake, Apu, etc.  ""For now I am going to party like it was on sale for $19.99!""

Summer of 4'2"": After Lisa realises how unpopular she is (no one wants to sign her yearbook), she tries to remake herself as a slacker tween when the family goes on vacation to the Flanders' beach house.  ""Celebrate the independence of your country by blowing up a small piece of it.""

As usual, this collection includes many deleted scenes (all collected together on the last disc, or you can watch them within each episode), a commentary on each-and-every episode, and the shows are unbutchered (unlike the syndicated versions you see on network TV).  The Marge head box is interesting, but not particularly practical (I, for one, couldn't ever get everything to fit back in it after opening it once).",1162425600,,3607,4.900990099009901

3337002,4,B000035P8B,"Again, this release fails to receive 5 stars based only on the packaging. When reviewing a product, content and container count equally! Especially in the case of this season, for which the more ""traditional"" packaging is available. I recommend that you go that route instead of this ""collector"" Marge head packaging.

As for the episodes themselves, the laughter continues right where it left off in Season 6. Many were disappointed in the unveiling of the culprit in Who Shot Mr. Burns, part 2. I, however, thought the episode was brilliant up to that point, and with the extra features giving you insight into the hundreds of subtleties pointing to the shooter (who shall remain unnamed in this review), it justifies the disappointing ending to the episode.

Other episodes I recommend are: Radioactive Man, Lisa the Vegetarian, Treehouse of Horror VI, Mother Simpson, Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming, Marge Be Not Proud, Team Homer, Two Bad Neighbors, Homer the Smithers, Short Films About Springfield, Homerpalooza. Without going into much detail about each one (you can probably check other reviews for full episode descriptions), suffice to say that each of these episodes is either packed with hilarity that will have you watching them repeatedly, or such a unique concept (Short Films and Two Bad Neighbors in particular) that they make this a more-than-enjoyable season to add to your collection.

Again, the special features include episode commentaries on each episode, as well as a few other featurettes. Some of them are well worth your time, others are just novelties that Simpsons creators insist on including for the extreme-diehard fans. If you do not own this season yet, do yourself a favour and go buy it! It's worth every penny, especially if you avoid the Marge head packaging!",1152144000,,1797,5.126279863481229
3337003,3,B000035P8B,My favorite episode is when Homer gains 65 pounds so that he can work at home in King size homer.  The other episodes that are really good are Lisa the vegetarian and Homer the smithers.  The rest of the episodes range from being generic to pretty good.  This is not my favorite season and I also had problems with the discs freezing and skipping.  I exchanged several times at the store I bought it from and it still has problems which is why I gave this three stars - and these episodes are not as funny as in the past.,1147910400,,521,4.18

parts are interlaced which cause lines to look stepped. then sometimes the picture would slightly bounce (bad source, i guess) or the quality looks like a copy from a vhs.

3337019,5,B000035P8B,"If any of you are familiar with The Curmudgeon's other reviews, you may well be scratching your heads at this one. A FIVE star review?! That can't be right. And usually, YOU would be right. The Curmudgeon has dedicated 95 of his 100 reviews to bringing you the very worst things out there. To celebrate the 50 review milestone I reviewed 5 GREAT things that are available on Amazon, and so, now I've reached 100, I thought I'd do the same again. So, from reviews 100 - 105, it's going to be nothing but good, great and awesome stuff.

You can't help but adore The Simpsons. Sure, some of the more recent episodes are in danger of eating themselves in terms of ""wackiness"" and lack of character driven plot, but that aside, it's still the most consistently hilarious, satirical and downright ingenious program on television. Season Seven still sees them at their peak, with brilliant scripts and some genuinely touching moments. Just ignore the rubbish 3-D episode. Yuch.

It's when you really delve into Springfield you realise JUST how good a show The Simpsons really is. Has there ever been a show that has such a wide variety of fully fleshed, loveable characters that can co-exist outside of the main family? Think Mr Burns, Apu, Barney, Mo, Smithers, Patty and Selma, Groundskeeper Willie, Krusty, Skinner.. the list is ENDLESS. All these characters have quirks, catchphrases, identities and histories.. The Simpsons haven't created a TV show, they've pretty much created their own universe.

So this review isn't just for Season Seven. This review is in praise of The Simpsons itself - quite easily the greatest sitcom of all time. And as for the DVDs themselves? They are a fitting testament to the show; lovingly created, with commentaries for EVERY episode (sometimes the commentaries are better than the episodes themselves), and more extras than you'll ever know what to do with. These new collectable packaging (optional, of course) only serve as a reminder of how savvy and keyed-in to their audiences that Matt Groening et al really are.

As Mr Burns might well say - ""huzzah.""

And that's part two of five taken care of. Three more things that The Curmudgeon actually likes. But what on earth could they be? Only one way to find out...

3337024,5,B000035P8B,"To me, this is when The Simpsons really hit its stride. There is not a single weak episode in this collection (or the sixth season, either). It wasn't until season nine or ten that the show started to go downhill, and fast. As far as one reviewer's complaint about Lisa, I have to disagree. Lisa was always the conscience of the family, whether questioning her dad's morals in stealing cable or feeling the pain of Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II feeling ignored when the elephant moved in. In short, great season, great DVD's, and now for the standard question to FOX. When is season eight due to come out?",1140393600,,613,4.581818181818182
3337025,5,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is the greatest sitcom of all-time.  No question.  BUT, this is the season where it really started to drift from the formula.  And why?  One word: LISA.  The episode where she becomes a vegitarian was the start of the countless Lisa based, greenpeace, animal rights, civil unrest, seriousness that I really do not want when searching for entertainment.  It sort-of continued in ""Lisa the Iconoclast""

A message is OK, but Lisa was never anyone's favorite and it seemed like she was the vehicle for the writers to make a point.  The Simpsons, as all pure entertainment should be, used to be fundamentally pointless.  Political satire was used for humor, not necessarily to make a political statment.  And the show was satiracle of both the right and the left.  Something changed about that formula in this season.  There are more classic episodes in this collection than not though.  It was a great season.  But why did the writers feel they needed to shove Lisa down our throats at this point?

They also seemed to name drop with the cameos more after this season.  Instead of celebrities playing themselves they should play regular characters.  Except for the Rolling Stones and Athletes. :)

The Simpsons could go on for years if they just revert to the formula.  Humor should come first.  Alot of episodes after season seven (unlike previous seasons)where just boring and preachy.  I say back to the old ways!",1139961600,,1425,4.854166666666667

This has to be one of the most consistently funny shows out there, and the fact that they have been able to keep it as funny as they have for as long as they have is a testament to the high quality of the show, the actors, and the writers. Simply put, if you don't like The Simpsons, you won't like this, (and I wonder why you are wasting your time reading reviews for it,) but if you do like it, this season is great and I love having all these shows at hand to watch whenever I want - you will, too. I think it's a no-brainer. Enjoy!",1138665600,,595,3.8852459016393444
3337028,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh installment of one of the greatest animated series of all time features some of the most memorable episodes the crew of Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon ever produced. The storylines are exceptional in every episode, with non stop laughter from each episode. Also, to make the DVD completely worth your money, included is deleted scenes, commentary, and scenes shown in sketch form. As for the product getting 4.5 stars from me, I removed 0.5 stars for the very shoddy packaging. There is absolutely no excuse for it.

The season opens with the cliffhanger from Season 6 on who shot Mr. Burns. Although this has some great laughs, it doesn't do much for me personally since I've seen it way too many times. Classics flood this season, and included that mix has to be ""King-Size Homer"". Homer Simpson intentionally gains weight to qualify for disability and work at home. George Bush(it's not actually him) stars in ""Two Bad Neighbors"" as him and Homer fight because Mr. Bush spanked Bart. Lisa's vegetarianism is a highlight too, with Paul and Linda McCartney making a memorable appearance. One of my personal favourites is the episode featuring Abe Simpson as a member of the Flying Hellfish, up against Mr. Burns in a battle for German paintings. Perhaps the most significant moment of Season 7 is Homer venturing into the ""3rd Dimension"" in the Treehouse of Horror episode. The writers describe the enormous costs for the scene, and the animation is outstanding. ""22 Short Episodes About Springfield"" has some hilarious moments, most specifically when a very tall man humiliates Nelson Munts. Some more of my favourites include ""Summer of 4'2"", ""Homer The Smithers"", ""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly"" and ""Bart Sells His Soul"".

Overall, this is simply an extraordinary collection of amazing Simpsons episodes that any fan would love. I personally think the show is bad now, but they had some outstanding episodes, highlighted from Seasons 3-10, and these episodes all shine brightly in the mix of those seasons. Highly recommended for any fan of the TV show.",1138579200,,2088,5.031791907514451
3337029,5,B000035P8B,"Probably the bes ever season of the series every episode great wow this was first on 11 years ago and still funny and if not even more funny the minute it is out i will bye it

3337030,5,B000035P8B,"For me, these are the best episodes that Matt Groening and Co. have ever come out with. They are so funny, but also, and i know this sounds wierd, they are actually really good stories. The animation looks its best (compared to the early seasons).

The case is brilliant, even the inside.

There are a lot of episodes

3337031,5,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons, while at its peak, was one of the funniest, smartest, heartwarming, and just plain fun shows out there.  It is sad that in recent years it has decided to try too hard to follow the footsteps of other shows, such as Family Guy and South Park instead of blazing its own creative trail.  During season 7 of the series, however, the Simpsons was still incredibly funny and original.  The episodes would often make you laugh, but would still deliver an overall positive moral message.  The characters were well-balanced within the Simpson family, with episodes not entirely revolving around Homer falling into crazy schemes.  The supporting characters were valuable to the situations and provided numerous laughs and gags.  If you want a fun, compelling and overall enjoyable experience, I strongly recommend this DVD.",1136937600,,827,5.134328358208955
3337032,5,B000035P8B,"I'd say if you had to get one dvd collection of the simpsons either buy this one, season 6 or wait for season 8. Why? Because these are the seasons when Springfield is in full swing. Unlike the first 4 seasons(and some episodes of the 5th) all the animation is smooth, and the humor really begins to take form. And unlike the later seasons (after season 9 or 10) the plots are still sensical and fresh. And the humor is as strong as ever.

But most of all in these episodes the Simspsons as characters really begin to take shape, as most of the plots are very character driven, they are touching yet still loaded with great jokes.

Homer has his wonderful classic oaf personality in ""King-sized homer"" and ""team homer"" and the touching episode where he meets his mother ""mother simpson"". Marge even gets a great episode that included fantastic satire about country clubs in ""scenes from the class struggle in Springfield"". Lisa begins to develop to rebel against american society in the classic episode ""Lisa the Vegeterian"", and ""Lisa the Iconoclast"" and Lisa's friendless social life is finally explored in ""Summer of 4 ft. 2"". Bart shines as a devil with a conscious in ""Bart sells his soul"" and ""marge be not proud"" and ""the curse of the flying hellfish"" which also develops the supporting character of Granpa, which was another great thing about season 7, it not only developed the simpsons as characters but the other inhabitants of Springfield such as Apu in ""much Apu about nothing"" and krusty in ""bart the fink"" and smithers and mr. burns in ""who shot mr. burns"" and one of my favorite episodes ""homer the smithers"" even geeky sidekick Millhouse got developed in the classic ""Radioactive man"" and the entire flanders family is fleshed out in one of my favorite episodes ""home sweet home diddly dum doodily"" . The entire town is featured in the genius experemental episode ""22 short films about Springfield"".

Still like every season it had it's clunkers such as this season's sideshow bob episode ""sideshow bob's last gleaming"" which was weak in comparison to all of the other sideshow bob episodes. And ""two bad neighbors"" was of lower quality(it seemed to foreshadow an episode from season 12 or 13.) But every season has it's downfalls, and still with 25 episodes( a large number in comparison to most seasons) you can expect a few bad ones.

So overall I'd have to say that this is one of the best Simpsons seasons yet and a must have for any simpsons fan... if you don't like it then you probably missed the satire... and shut up about the packaging... nobody cares.",1136592000,,2580,4.713968957871397

I don't find this one around very much for sale.  And the ones I do find are all damaged!

Like the vile Homer-head package, don't expect this one to last very long before it gets damaged, if it's not already damaged when you get it.",1135209600,,332,4.076923076923077

All of our favorite characters are still with us (mine are Mr. Burnes, Patti & Selma, Ralph Wiggium & Lisa Simpson). Matt Groneg (sp?) is still the creator, but as some reviewers have said, the simpsons have been through every scenerio-slice of life possible and then some, and all to often now are victims of pop culture-- (remember when Dustin Hoffman guest stared and they used another name?).

If Arrested Development gets cancelled, please Fox, please send some of the writers over to the Simpsons.",1134950400,,697,4.480314960629921
3337038,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh season of the Simpsons is a little low on laugh-out-loud hysteria, but the writing was still top notch, at least for most of the 25 episodes. But after the complete immortal brilliance of seasons 3 through 6, this season marks a real transition into the downfall years, starting with season 8, when the show really started to run out of ideas and get repetitive. Perhaps the biggest advancement in this particular season was a greater focus on the unity of the Simpson family, which is infinitely stronger and more realistic than the cheesy family values trumpeted by politicians and other frumps. This is most evident in ""Home Sweet Homediddly-dum-doodly"" (also a powerhouse for the Flanders family), ""Bart Sells His Soul,"" ""Marge Be Not Proud,"" and especially the Emmy-worthy ""Mother Simpson."" The production team was still working on important character developments this season as well, with the big winner being Lisa in both ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" and ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2."" We also get important advancements in the characters of Grampa in ""...'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'"" and Marge in ""Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield.""

Unfortunately, cracks in the Simpsons empire began to show this year &#8211; a foreshadowing of the mistakes of the next two or three seasons. ""Two Bad Neighbors,"" starring George H.W. Bush, is both a clunky use of a real-life person and it does serious damage to the continuity of the Simpsons universe. And the unfortunate trend of latching a storyline onto current events and then-popular people, a real source of trouble in future seasons, can be seen here in the badly dated ""Homerpalooza."" Meanwhile, ""King Size Homer"" marks the first time that the writers tackled a sensitive social issue but couldn't refrain from low blows and name-calling, resulting in a very problematic construction of a moral theme. However, some of this season's best episodes still maintain the madcap genius of the previous years (if in a slightly more subdued fashion), those being ""Homer the Smithers"" and ""Bart the Fink,"" among others. And there is a real advancement in experimental episode construction with the awesome ""22 Short Films About Springfield."" When all is said and done, this is still a great season for the Simpsons &#8211; and the last truly great season for a while. [~doomsdayer520~]",1134691200,,2345,5.090909090909091
3337039,5,B000035P8B,"Ok, I'm biased. I love The Simpsons. LOVE THE SIMPSONS! And if you're a die-hard fanatic of this show like me, then the 7th season is something you must buy immediately. Of course, I won't be content until I own ALL seasons of The Simpsons eventually, but the 7th season contains some of the most amusing episodes ever: like when George & Barbara Bush move across the street from the Simpson family; the Halloween episode with 3-D Homer (a classic!); the episode where Selma marries Troy McClure; the one with Marge's Channel suit; even the Homerpalooza episode. Trust me, this is one season you don't want to be without!",1134691200,,621,4.706422018348624
3337040,5,B000035P8B,"To start, season 7 of the Simpsons is available in two different packaging options. One is the Marge head, which is along the lines of the Homer shaped head packaging of the last set, and the other is the box form which is supposed to be along the lines of the previous five seasons. At first I had planned to buy the box form set, but after a friend purchased it before me, he clearly informed me to beware. The box form packaging of season 7 is exactly like the alternate packaging for season 6; it's simply a slip cover for what was inside the Homer head. Upon hearing this I decided to simply pick up the Marge head. While I wasn't crazy about the Homer head, I didn't mind it, and actually preferred it to the slip cover. Whether you buy the Marge head or go with the Slip cover casing, one thing is certain: What's inside the head is the good stuff.

Seasons 4-8 were arguably when the Simpsons hit their stride. While I'm still fond of season 3 as well, it's hard to argue against any of these episodes. I don't want to go into great detail about all the episodes or give a plot synopsis for each one, because if you would like that, there are spotlight reviews to help you. However season 7 contains some of my personal favorite episodes, including the conclusion to ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" (which has my all time favorite simpson's quote by Officer Wiggum, where he says Homer is under arrest for the attempted murder of Mr. Burns, Homer yells ""Doh!"" and then Wiggum says ""Yea that's what they all say, Doh.""), Bart selling his soul to Milhouse for $5, Milhouse getting the part as Fall Out Boy in the Radioactive Man Movie, Sideshow Bob returning to threaten Springfield with a weapon of mass destruction, and the Treehouse Of Horror VI episode (best besides Treehouse of Horror II in season 3). Really every episode in this season has its own charm, but these just happen to be my favorites. As usual the extras are a great addition to the set. You get the usual commentaries on every episode, featurettes, deleted scenes, and many more things that have never been available before now. Fox also seems to be getting the sets out quicker (season 6 in August, season 7 in December, fastest period between releases yet) so we can only hope that we have season 8 resting in our hands fairly soon.

If you're a fan of the Simpsons, most likely you're going to be very pleased with this set. There's plenty of great and memorable episodes found on this set, to go along with the great extras that have been included. The writing was witty, the jokes were entertaining, and the animation was great, and that all makes season 7 a great addition to a Simpsons' fan's collection. While it might not be the best overall season the show has seen (and there are going to be ongoing disputes for eternity on which one that is) it's definitely on par with any of the stellar seasons 4-8.

This is a MUST-OWN for all Simpsons fans, and frankly should be in every DVD aficionado's collection.  The extras are incredible, but if the episodes were the only offering on the discs, even that'd be enough.  So in a nutshell, if you don't own it, get it now!",1134604800,,464,4.488095238095238
3337042,3,B000035P8B,"The Simpson's peaked in Season 5.  Season 6 had some great moments, but I dare anyone to say that Season 6 didn't have a few clunkers.  It's more of the same in Season 7.  What's so funny about Homer in 3D?  Yes, the animation was good, but the episode just wasn't funny.  The Sideshow Bob episode was awful.  The Homerpalooza episode also missed the mark.  And even the conclusion of the ""Who shot Mr Burns episode"" was clever, but let's be honest, was it laugh out loud funny?  The answer is NO.  And someone please tell me why they even made ""22 Short Films about Springfield"".

Of course there were some great episodes in Season 7: Homer's Bowling team, Homer gaining weight until he weighed 300 pounds and had to work from home, former President Bush moving in next door.  Please note that I am not trying to dissuade anyone from buying Season 7, but if one decides to buy all 17 (and counting) seasons of The Simpsons, you're looking at a pretty substantial investment.  It pains me to say this, but even for diehard fans like me who have never missed an episode, from here on in, it may be smart and pick and choose which season's to buy.

3337051,5,B000035P8B,"The seventh season of the Simpsons saw Matt Groening's prime time, brilliantly hilarious animated series not missing a single step.  As this season opens, we learn who shot Mr. Burns (and honestly, who didn't see it coming?), and everything from that point forward is nothing but memorable, whimsical, and often insane humor that only the Simpsons could bring.  Also in this season, Hollywood comes to Springfield to film a Radioactive Man movie, and Millhouse ends up getting cast as sidekick Fallout Boy (""Radioactive Man""), Homer and Marge get accused of being negligent parents and Bart, Lisa, and Maggie get sent to live with the Flanders' (""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly""), Bart sells his soul for five dollars (""Bart Sells His Soul""), Lisa becomes a vegetarian after attending a petting zoo (""Lisa the Vegetarian"", which also features Paul and the late Linda McCartney as themselves), Homer becomes morbidly obese so he doesn't have to go to work (""King-Size Homer""), Homer is re-united with his long lost mother (voiced by Glenn Close in ""Mother Simpson""), Sideshow Bob returns with a vendetta against television (""Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming""), former President George Bush moves next door (the hilarious and unpredictable ""Two Bad Neighbors""), Bart meets the real creator of Itchy & Scratchy (voiced by Kirk Douglas in ""The Day the Violence Died""), Pulp Fiction gets hilariously spoofed (""22 Short Films About Springfield""), and Homer becomes a sideshow freak after going to Lolapalooza (""Homerpalooza"", which also features the Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Peter Frampton).  The ""Treehouse of Horror"" special this season was also a memorable smash, climaxing with Homer's unforgettable journey into the 3-D world.  ""The Simpsons 138th Show Spectacular"" is a real gem, hosted by Troy McClure (voiced by the late, great Phil Hartman) as we the viewer are treated to rarely seen early takes of the characters, alternate endings, and deleted scenes that never saw the light of day, as well as some hidden messages and trivia as well.  All in all, just like all the early seasons of the Simpsons, you can't go wrong with the seventh season, and it's pure animated lunacy at it's very best.  Let's just hope that the packaging is much better than the incredibly poorly designed Homer head shaped package that contained season six.",1131321600,,2347,5.212201591511937

So, all in all, it sounds like a pretty sweet set, and I if your a Simpsons fan, pick up this for sure.  And finally, Fox gets it right.

The first episode will bring us one of the greatest ones ever; we will be able to discover who shot Mr. Burns in the sequel of: WHO SHOT MR. BURNS?

In the middle of the season, TREEHOUSE OF HORROR VI has the famous short in which Homer converts himself in a three dimension figure.

Another good episode among others in this season is the one called 22 SHORT FILMS ABOUT SPRINFIELD, a very dynamic episode made to be one of the best ""screenplays"" from the writers of the show.

The best thing that happen this time when the DVD comes out in December is that we will have the ability to choose the box and hopefully this will end those endless and tiresome discussions about FOX inability to do proper marketing.

At this point all of us should know that they are delivering two seasons every year and this time FOX has fulfilled the expectations.",1129420800,,895,4.466257668711656

3337057,5,B000035P8B,"Season 9s episode Trash Of The Titans is a classic. Probably one of my favorites. Okay  like everyone it is just because of the Garbageman Can song paroding The Candyman Can. To make a long story short, best episode ever.",1086566400,,221,4.525
3337058,5,B000035P8B,"These Are 6 of the best episodes of The Simpsons available
on three tapes.
DVD sets are coming out but, they have not got to the seasons
which these episodes are from
This is my second favorite Simpsons episode of all time.
First off, In a spoof of Gremlins and Child's Play.
Homer buys a killer doll for bart that tries to kill him.
And boy is it hilarious.
Next is Ape Island which is a take off on King Kong.
Homer is King Kong and you can see how funny this will be.
Dial Z for zombie follows. Dawn of the Dead in Springfield is what you are getting and I just can'r get enough.
Some of the best lines ever are in this one fragment of an episode. As homer forgets to seal off the doors to the house
and Flanders is a zombie. Classic.
Second Episode: My Favorite Simpsons Episode Ever.
Is The Simpsons verion of Stephen King's The Shining.
As Bart can read Groundskeeper Willies mind. And Homer
goes mad and tries to kill the family because no beer and no
TV make Homer go crazy. What a gem
Now for my Favorite ""Time and Punishment"" Now first off I love
time travel stories and movies. And the way the poke fun at the
silliness of it all here is top notch. Homer builds a time machine out of a toaster and goes back to pre-historic times
and changes the future by sneezing and sitting on a fish.
When he comes back Ned Flanders is Ruler of the world.
Oh I love this.
Now to Nightmare Cafeteria. Which is bascially Soylent Green.
As kids in Springfield are cooked up in the school cafeteria.
great.
Tape 2: Bart Sells his soul to Milhouse who in turn trades it for ALF pogs. This episode is great as Moe opens a family resteraunt.
Next is Lisa the Skeptic which is a very good episode that
touches on the question of science vs religion vs corporation.
Very apocalyptic yet in a very silly way. I love this episode.
Tape 3: Two Sideshow Bob Episodes
First Bob is in prison and gets out because of a radio talk show
host ""Rush Limbaugh"" is who he is supposed to be. He then runs
for office and rigs the election. Lisa and Bart discover this.
Funny episode.
Last is Cape Feare where The Simpsons go in witness protection.
As Sideshow Bob is after bart. The funniest part about this episode is Bart is scared he will die and Homer keeps busting in the room like "" Hey bart checkout my new chainsaw"" it is
very funny. all in all
If you love The Simpsons like I Do. GO ahead and get this.
DVD's are coming really slow.",1084492800,,2415,4.206896551724138
3337059,5,B000035P8B,"This is a hilariously entertaining set of videos that center around the Halloween specials, such as ""The Shinning."" This is where Homer turns crazy when he discovers that television and beer are unavailable at the creepy hotel. Other classic episodes are included, which are guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.",998870400,,313,5.1568627450980395
3337060,5,B000035P8B,"You don't really expect me to start writing generally about the Simpsons, do you? Because there's really no point to it. The Simpsons is simply the best TV comedy of all times, period. To explain why would take much, much more than a 1000 words. And this particular tape contains two of the funniest Simpsons episodes ever, both of them featuring Kelsey Grammer as the manic Sideshow Bob. I am not really a fan of 'Frasier', but Grammer IS a great actor, and prsonally I think that Sideshow Bob is his best character.
Although 'Krusty Gets Busted', the episode that introduced Bob, is missing, Bob's two funniest appearences are here. 'Black Widower', a truly unforgettable episode from the show's 3rd season, is incredibly funny, especially the last five minutes. Even funnier is 'Cape Feare' from season 5, revolving around Bob's attempts to kill Bart Simpson, and featuring brilliant parodies on classic horror films like 'Cape Fear' and 'Psycho'. Both are exceptionally good episodes from an excepitol(d'oh!)ly good series.",994032000,,1027,5.119047619047619
3337061,2,B000035P8B,"Actually this particular simpsons episode (2 of them) were not up to the standard.  Eventhough I am a big fan of Simpsons I could not watch this one completely. ""Monorail was a tragedy"". and Marge's acting along with Ned was stupid.",989712000,,232,4.658536585365853
3337062,5,B000035P8B,"I just recieved my ""Trick or Treehouse"" collection a week or two ago. It has a truely wonderful selection of Simpsons videos. Although only one of these three videos are Halloween specials as the sets name can make you think the other two can also relate to the somewhat creepy theme of the set. The Halloween video has some of my favorite Treehouse of Horrors episodes with Treehouse of Horrors 3 and 5. Springfield Murder Mysterys brings back the memory of Sideshow Bob and his murderous attemps for revenge when he attemps to murder Aunt Selma and tries once again to kill Bart. And in the final video ""Heaven and Hell"" Bart sells his soul to Millhouse for five dollars and must find it in his religon and in himself to find his soul and learn what his soul is to him and when Lisa finds what looks to be the skeleton of an angel she is left alone to prove to the town that it isn't really an angel, but what will happen at sundown?",983318400,,935,4.318181818181818
3337063,5,B000035P8B,"This set contains some of the best episodes in the Simpson's history.  Cape Feare is my personal favorite.  Both of the Halloween episodes are classics, especially ""The Shinning"".  The ""Heaven and Hell"" tape is good, but not quite what the other two are.  This is definitely a must for any Simpsons fan.",978480000,,303,4.769230769230769
3337064,4,B000035P8B,"These are some good episodes, the Side Show Bob (2) ones alone almost justify the price.  The Halloween specials are #'s II and V for some reason. Until you can buy more than two episodes per tape at a time, this is one box set worth having.",975888000,,241,4.127659574468085
3337065,4,B000035P8B,"Heaven and Hell is a fantastic tape of the hilarious, clever, animated satire, ""The Simpsons.""  The first episode in this entry is appropriately titled, ""Bart Sells His Soul."" It is filled with many subtle but wonderful jokes.  Bart sells his soul to his friend Milhouse for $5.00, believing it does not exist.  He soon goes to great lengths to retrieve it as he faces many unexpected problems and complications without it.  In this episode there is also a hilarious subplot wherein Moe converts his lowly bar into a wholesome family restaurant in the hopes of making more money. This subplot hilariously satires popular family restaurants.  The name of his restaurant alone evokes laughs(Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag).  A series fan will be very impressed with this very bright episode. The second episode, ""Lisa the Skeptic,"" is equally comical.  Lisa unearths a skeleton that bares a striking resemblance to an angel. All the townspeople believe it is an angel with the exception of Lisa who belives it is fake. The townspeople quickly become obssessed with it. Some of the funniest scenes in this episode are the ones with Homer trying to make money off the supposed angel.  There are many jokes in this episode about the debate of religion vs. science which are not offensive but are rather very creative and witty.  Also, the final plot twist in this episode was very unpredictable but well thought out and completely satisfying for the viewer.  Matt Groening, the creator of ""The Simpsons,"" should be proud of himself for releasing another Simpsons tape that will delight people across the country and cause them to laugh uncontrollably.  This tape is recommended to anyone who likes comic relief and will make Simpson fans out of many new viewers.",974160000,,1753,4.989690721649485
3337066,5,B000035P8B,"To the person who mentioned them possibly putting out all the THOH on DVD, they are apparently releasing Simpsons DVD's starting in February. They are going to do full seasons, with lots of extras. Apparently similar to the ""X-Files"" DVD's (which I've never seen.)",972777600,,264,5.0227272727272725
3337067,2,B000035P8B,"The Simpsons is the hippest, funniest animated series, bar-none, but I have a couple of complaints about this set. First, why only two episodes per tape? At 22 minutes per show, why not put three or four on a tape? Second, why call it the Treehouse of Horrors Gift Set if only two out of the six episodes included are Treehouse of Horrors? That seems terribly misleading to me, and the Amazon.com reviewer did well to advise the customers of this fact.
If this were actually a set of Treehouse of Horror eps I-IX, three eps per tape, I would buy it in a second. As it stands, I will not buy this set, and can't recommend it, as much as I love the Simpsons.",972777600,,656,4.256
3337068,5,B000035P8B,"I'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant by these not being the best THOH episodes.  IIRC, THOH IV is the one where Homer sells his soul for a  donut.  That's the greatest THOH ever made!  Also, Cape Feare is my  favorite Simpsons ever!  This set is going to be even cooler than the  Simpsons Go Hollywood.",967680000,,311,4.350877192982456
