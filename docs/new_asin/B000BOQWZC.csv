8090281,5,B000BOQWZC,"Domicile Conjugal is one of those films that prove it is not necessary to use famous actors or expensive scenaries to make a good movie.
It describes the features of communal life in a Parisian apartment block and the relation between the two protagonists with levity and creativity, sustained by a rich colloquial language.",1364774400,,324,5.018518518518518
8090282,4,B000BOQWZC,"No #4 in the Antoine series, five films beginning with 400 Blows, Antoine, the dreamer, has got himself a fine young wife, his opposite really, prim and well mannered.  Their romantic first year is a series of funny neighbors and comical whimsy.  I learned how to die the color of flowers, more interesting than one would think.  I learned about hurrying a wife along by throwing her coat and bag down a stairway.  I learned that relationships go wrong when one gives in to lust.  Hey, I knew that.

Jean-Pierre Leaud has a physical resemblance to Truffaut.  These episodic films, the ones in color that I have seen remind one of a HBO mini-series.  His autobiographical Doinel is from a broken family.  In the 400 blows, a masterpiece really of the New French Cinema in the late 50's, we see the lonely kid grasping for understanding.  In subsequent films, we see the young adult Doinel grasp at relationship and career.  The next beautiful woman is always around the corner.  In Bread and Board, the femme fatale is 70's Japanese Go Go Chick, Hiroko Berghauer.  Notice the heavy eye make-up on the women that make them look like zombies.",1146009600,,1139,4.691919191919192
