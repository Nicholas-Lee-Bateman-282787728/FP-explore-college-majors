5726545,5,B00CMDPTA4,"The human species made a huge error when it built its entire civilization and economy on petroleum and other fossil fuels. Now we're addicted to fuels that kill us and the earth from sourcing to refining to using, and there are way too many of us to be supported by clean energy. The fossil fuel industries are death industries and now we see the head of Exxon chosen to be secretary of state. Sick.

5726557,3,B00CMDPTA4,"Very interesting archival footage and history of the industry.  Unfortunately, it's over-dramatized in places, and much of this 1992 production is rendered obsolete by the Fracking Revolution.  The author strongly subscribes to the Peak Oil fallacy, as well many shades of pop Environmentalism.  He touches on but doesn't emphasize how ""foreign oil companies"" not only discovered and developed this worthless commodity all over the world, but stabilized the market for decades, and allowed the Oil Economy to grow sufficiently to make oil valuable enough to expropriate.  Image quality is fair; sound is poor in places and, without subtitles, some of the dialogue is garbled.",1448755200,,675,5.461538461538462
5726558,3,B00CMDPTA4,"What an absolutely wonderful miniseries. I remember watching it when it first came out in 1992 and in recent times looked hard for an affordable copy. None were available until now. The history of oil, the power and politics of it are captivating. The narration is crisp and entertaining. It's informative and enjoyable.

The downside is the video and sound quality of this DVD reproduction are lousy and there are no subtitles to help make your way through the hard to understand dialects of some of the participants. It looks like this was put together by some kids with no experience. If it weren't for these technical failings it would certainly rate a full 6 stars. Like other reviewers I'm glad to have a copy I can watch, but really hope someone gets their head out of that recess and offers this later on in the original quality.",1448582400,,837,4.655405405405405

5726561,2,B00CMDPTA4,"This outstanding PBS TV series has long been a favorite of mine.  I recorded this show off the air when it was first broadcast and I have watched this VHS tape many times.  Therefore, I was very pleased when I discovered that this program was available on DVD, which would finally allow me to retire my old VHS tape.  In view of the low price and the fact that 7 hours of program have been compressed on only two discs, I wasn't having great expectations of outstanding video quality, but I was hoping that it would be at least as good as my VHS tape.  Unfortunately, I was wrong and the video quality of this DVD is absolutely horrible.  It makes you wonder where the producing studio (Millcreek Entertainment) has gone to find such a poor master.

While the quality of the video is not the best, the subject matter is a comprehensive history of the development of the oil industry in the United States and worldwide. Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer prize-winning author of The Prize, is featured and Donald Sutherland does an excellent job as the narrator.

Viewing this video gives the viewer a much better understanding of the many factors that play a role in the development, availability, and price of oil. An excellent follow-up to this DVD is Yergin's book The Quest which brings us up to the present on various types of energy and energy security.",1396828800,,641,4.8807339449541285

5726605,4,B00CMDPTA4,"This is a the fascinating story of the oil businesses, from its rough and tumble beginnings in Pennsylvania and Ohio to its status today as the world's most vital international resource.  It contains lots of excellent footage and portrayals of key players like John D. Rockefeller.  Daniel Yergin's book is the basis of it, and he is interviewed extensively, along with a couple of other historians.  This must be a popular documentary, because my local PBS station used to show it during fundraisers.  I have been wanting this for a long time and was delighted to see it get released on DVD.  So why is it such a lousy copy?  It looks it was transferred from VHS tapes or something - images are a little blurry and the colors are way off.  Hopefully there will be a better version put out sometime in the future, but for now, at the bargain price of under $10, grab it.",1388620800,5,870,4.503184713375796

If you don't study the oil industry, you don't really have a prayer of understanding the 20th century. This remarkable documentary somehow condenses Yergin's absolutely brilliant 800 page book into a crash course in oil history and oil politics. As other reviewers have noted this DVD is sub-bootleg quality, but it's still the best $5 you'll ever spend on a documentary. Some years ago I contacted Yergin's company trying to get a copy; I guess a lot of others did as well.

5726609,4,B00CMDPTA4,"I bought this DVD copy today at a Wal-Mart. I found it in their $5 bin, right on top. I was quite stunned to have found it. I had the book recently and sold it. I didn't get to see the original PBS version since at about that era, I had ditched the TV (August 1993 or so) and have never had one since. Since it was purchased at such a cheap price, I wasn't too concerned about the quality. I listened to it with headphones, and still saw and heard what I needed and wanted to learn and hear. Then, again, I am working on a history master's thesis on an unrelated topic, and professional historians are used to having to deal with poor stills, videos, and audio works. For $5, I couldn't complain.",1380326400,,696,4.162962962962963
5726610,5,B00CMDPTA4,"I remember seeing this documentary on PBS.  I in fact taped in on a VCR.  The VHS tape went out of print and a complete set on VHS became difficult to find at a  reasonable price.  I have to say that this is one of my favorite documentaries.  The criticism of the visual aspect is fair.  This documentary appears to simply have been put onto a DVD without any effort to clean it up.

As far as i am concerned, I am glad to have it.  I previously have made attempts to contact the producers of the documentary.  I have contacted PBS.  I got no where.  PBS said that their license to broadcast it or produce it for sale had expired.  They had no plan to renew the license.  The producers said nothing.  A friend of mine was able to download the series as separate parts from the internet as a bit torrent.  The reproduction was often much worse than the current DVD release and would have actual problems with tracking the VHS tape.  In essence, at least we do not have this problem with the picture.

The Prize is a history of the 20th century.  The importance of petroleum in modern life is so great and pervasive that one cannot separate the history of petroleum with the history of the world.  Both world wars would have looked very different without oil.  Production of modern mass transport of people and products (along with all of the highways) would not have occurred without oil.  Availability of cheap natural resources so abundant in the United States made our modern economy possible.

Get the documentary while you still can at a cheap price.  VHS copies new and used are in the 100's of dollars.  Viewing the VHS tapes on Hi-Def televisions will have a poor picture.  This is likely to be the best copy of this documentary that you will get unless the producers properly digitize this documentary.",1379116800,24,1810,4.495384615384616
5726611,4,B00CMDPTA4,"It is difficult to understand that this fantastic educational history can be so detailed and broadly inclusive of so much and yet be so inexpensive. I was expecting much less because of the low price. There is a lot of historic information on the beginnings of oil and all aspects of it from the early days to up to date modern times and all the different aspects of so many things in todays situation and society. The relationships between producing countries and the early oil companies was very interesting and then on to the changing relationships between those parties certainly kept my interest. The role that oil played in wars ever since and including the second world war was explained also. This program held my interest from start to finish and while it was full of information, it seemed to intertain also. I have several dvds on oil and several books...and this is the most comprehensive. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that the quality of the DVDs do not seem the best. I can understand the historic information not being top notch since some of the photography is very old....But, it was obvious that the quality should have been much better in the more modern parts.
Even though I have knowledge on oil and the history of oil, I learned quite a lot from this program...I highly recommend it.",1377820800,11,1328,4.6553191489361705
5726612,4,B00CMDPTA4,"Entertaining and educational. This mini-series, 8 episodes, tells the story from inception to the 1990s. Oil's great men, great product, and great ruthlessness. It's all there with amazing footage of gushers, fires, and the movers-and-shakers of the oil fields. The series is based on a Pulitzer winning book by the same name, author Daniel Yergin. Content is excellent.

The series is both color and lots of black & white due to all of the archival photos and film footage used. That's expected, and well done. The story is done well, covering much of the highlights of the oil era. It leaves the question of the most modern period, 1992-today, and the future. The only downside is the disastrous decision to release this miniseries in 2013
WITHOUT SUBTITLES.
Some accents need them desperately, and not just for the hard of hearing.
Of course, that keeps the cost down, which is minimal for a well done 7 hour documentary. It's a worthy DVD for fans of history, military, and biography; not to mention oil areas of Arabs and Texans.

It aired in 1991, and remains current today as we could not then easily see what the oil industry wrought, since 9/11 was a decade away. I would love to see the makers update this doc.  Even they couldn't see the horrible end game that oil would give birth to in the 21st century.  Luckily, the outlook for alternative energy is much better than they predicted.  I get all my home electricity from wind power, and bet they would have been shocked at that!  And I live in what was once a huge oil producing state.  I grew up in the oil industry, and then had oil and well service companies as clients of my own business. Many benefits were lavished on us in the 70s and 80s.  So I cannot casually trash them as all bad, although I am now firmly on the opposite side from big oil (or even little oil).  The days of living like a colonial are gone (thank goodness!), and even though it enriched my life, I am now horrified at the environmental and human cost.  This doc shows us a wide panorama of oil and its cost, with a completely unbiased view (of course, we didn't know then what we know now).  Even my dad, who worked for a major all his working life, thought this doc hit it all on the head.  He grew up in the oil biz, too, from the 30s onward, so lived much of what is shown here, and I guess they got it right.",1497830400,,1405,4.054347826086956
