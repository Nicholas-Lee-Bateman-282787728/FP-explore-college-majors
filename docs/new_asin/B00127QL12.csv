3078355,4,B00127QL12,"This is a solid video, with the most noteworthy feature being the portrayal of the character and perfectionism of Coach Don Shula.  Like many champions, the Dolphins and Shula (for him, count Super Bowl III) had come close previously but instead experienced bitter defeat, and the video captures their hunger for a Super Bowl win.  Shula was in many ways like Vince Lombardi in being a disciplinarian and hard driver, and he was even more of a perfectionist.  The 1972 Dolphins did not make many mistakes, certainly not at key times, and that was reflective of Shula's attention to detail: A mistake is made, then it will not be seen next time.  Shula had also picked up his former star quarterback Earl Morrall of Shula's days at Baltimore as a backup for Bob Griese, and Morrall filled in admirably when Griese ended up being injured for the bulk of the season.  Morrall was certainly aided by the Dolphins' famous no-name defense (take that oh-so-true oxymoron), who were really hungry for victory.

Along with Shula himself, fullback Larry Csonka and defensive end Manny Fernandez are good selections as commentators: the former the big star in the Dolphins formidable running attack, and the other was a vital cog in the no-name defense.  Off the field, the Dolphins had fun in the Florida sun, but they were real performers on the field.  They really wanted to avenge the Super Bowl loss to Dallas the year before.

One disappointment is that the extras were not that strong.  No extras were given or needed on running backs Mercury Morris and Jim Kiick, covered well in the regular part. But Hall of Fame receiver Paul Warfield, called a ""magician in cleats"" in highlight films, would have been a good focus, as would Hall of Fame guard Larry Little and safeties Dick Anderson and Jake Scott.  But I do want to highlight one positive in the regular part: The viewer gets to see many angles of that famous hit Minnesota Viking linebacker Roy Winston dished out on Csonka, who is here to tell you all about it himself.

What a team this was!  Granted, the easy regular season schedule was a fact, but the Dolphins handled some threatening teams like the Jets twice (with a healthy Namath in one of his best seasons), plus the Vikings and Chiefs, teams that although not in their championship years were always fearsome opponents.  As were, of course, the future four-time Super Bowl Pittsburgh Steeler team that the Dolphins whipped in the playoffs before beating the favored Redskins in the Super Bowl.  The extras show how the 1985 Bears came close to perfection (beaten by only, yes, the Dolphins), but this 17-0 Miami club is the NFL's only unbeaten and untied team ever.

The 1972 Dolphins finished 1st in points scored and yards gained, with total dominance in rushing yardage, plus fewest points and yards allowed.  This was without their starting quarterback Bob Griese for the better part of the year.  This video is important not just because of the unbeaten season, but because this was a team that was good enough to win the Super Bowl the following season as well and average over 11 wins a year in the regular season from 1970 to 1975, carving out a special niche in Pro Football History.",1373760000,4,3207,4.747747747747748
3078356,5,B00127QL12,"This series does a great job of highlighting some of professional football's greatest teams.  As a football fan, I really like the historical feel that brings back games I remember as a small boy.  As a Dolphins fan, this is quite simply a ""Must Own.""

3078357,5,B00127QL12,"What a wonderful presentation of the Dolphins 1972 season. This DVD brings back those wonderful memories and provides insight into the background of what was happening with the team. For example, Don Shula mentions why he brought 38-year-old Earl Morral on board. Larry Csonka speaks about Jim Kiick and his being willing to take a back seat to Mercury Morris. Manny Fernandez talks about the ""no name defense"" and how that nickname came about. Of course, there's much. Go ahead, take a trip down memory lane. You'll be glad you did.",1367971200,,533,4.868131868131868
3078358,1,B00127QL12,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.
