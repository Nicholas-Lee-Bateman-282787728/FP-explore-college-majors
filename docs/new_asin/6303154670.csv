586885,3,6303154670,"Hilarious!  This is a total B movie.  The Indians sound like surfers, and the white woman is dumb as a box of rocks, which makes her indian name--Not So Smart Woman--and her slightly crossed eyes even more appropriate.  Hubby and I had a ball heckling our way through.  If you're looking for believability or a real romance, you won't find it here.

586927,5,6303154670,A touching story about two people thrown together that really feel in love but couldn't stay together. The times weren't kind to those whites who fell in love with Indians.

The woman was so self-centered, I don't think she went by her feelings in staying with Hawk at the end, it was all about what other people will think of me if I end up with a Native Indian. I gave it a 5 stars because of the drama and it is about a Cheyenne warrior riding his horse bareback.

587027,3,6303154670,"I was eager to see this movie, but it did not live up to my expectations. The story was alright and not boring. The main reason for my objections are: If a person finds someone they love and want to be with, then that's what is most important. Children grow  up, leave and don't really give a crap about Parents..so if a Parent scarifies their happiness for a child. Then they wind up sad and alone. Love doesn't come that often and if it does it should be seized. The woman in this movie is very foolish and prejudice in my estimation.",1423180800,3,536,4.254901960784314

587042,2,6303154670,"I just watched this movie, and as stated above, it seemed to me to be a badly written and badly acted romance novel, set in the Old West of the early 1860s.  I'm glad I watched it to satisfy my curiosity, but my time would have been better spent vacuuming or doing the dishes.  However, it was better than just staring at a wall.  Of course, that only holds true if it's a single color wall.  Add a pattern, then the wall would probably win.",1387756800,2,441,4.152941176470589
587043,5,6303154670,This movie I saw back in the 80's. I loved the romance in it. I found that I was wishing for her to stay with him instead of her going back to her people. That is probably the only disappointment that I had.,1387411200,,207,3.8372093023255816

587086,4,6303154670,surprisingly good narrative.  it had the only ending this type  of while woman and native american story could logically have but still tugged at my heart.

587087,5,6303154670,"This movie is so good. The love story is beautiful and puts me in a good mood. I have been looking for this movie on DVD for a while now, so I'm excited Amazon now has it. Just like most movies, this is romanticized and unrealistic. However, sometimes you really need the love story.",1376265600,2,283,4.2592592592592595
587088,2,6303154670,Totally unbelievable. This would never happen. Acting not even passable. Ending was ridiculous and I would not recommend this to any one.,1375142400,,137,5.2727272727272725
587089,5,6303154670,"It'd been about 20 years since I'd seen this film and I'd forgotten about it. Then I rekindled my love for Westerns. I'd remembered it again when I saw Pato Hoffmann in Dr. Quinn Medicine woman. He's such a wonderful actor.

This is a great movie yes some of the direction is a little off but hey with the low budget they probable had I mean it was done well.  But that's why I love Westerns you really don't need to be perfect with them or have a high budget.

Just a good ol fashioned Romance/Western.

I love the characters especially Rebecca she's tough and doesn't complain but endures. I love it when Hawk tells her she's too Stubborn to be an Indian captive.",1372291200,2,665,4.338709677419355
587090,1,6303154670,"In 1994, after ""Dances with Wolves""(1990), there is absolutely no excuse to use white actors in the role of Native Americans. Even one of the main roles, the Cheyenne Warrior Hawk, is played by Pato Hoffmann, a Bolivian actor. And the scenes are borderline ridiculous: dining tables set in the middle of nowhere with table cloth, napkins, silverwear and glasses(!). All the Native American eat at the table with white manners and they all speak English (!!) It was hard to finish watching the entire movie.",1369440000,,506,4.895348837209302

587094,5,6303154670,"Liked: Short time frame for delivery, also good quality tape.

Unfortunately, Cheyenne Warrior is nowhere near as good.  The dialogue is not all that great, in particular when it comes to Pato Hoffman's attempts to sound like an Indian speaking English.  And the acting can only be classified as average at best.

Pato Hoffman was perfect as the vibrant cheyenne warrior chief Hawk, where has he been all my life ? Where is he acting now, as I cannot get Naturally Native and The Sentinel on DVD ? I have now bought Geronimo and Wild Bull to see him in action but it would be great to get more recent details of where he can be found as his fan website seems out of action.

Pato Hoffman is simply gorgeous and Kelly Preston, whilst struggling with some daft dialogue at times, can still manage to portray emotion in the right places most of the time. ( Note I put Mr Hoffman first - he deserves it!)
A feel-good film that I put on the TV on a grey, rainy day whilst snuggling down into a comfy sofa with a large glass of wine to alternately cry or sigh into!  Knowing the ultimate, desperate fate that awaits the Cheyenne of this era there must surely be material there for a subsequent film on Hawk?  Especially in this time of renewed interest in the injustices perpetrated against those people?
Buy this film and watch it when you're on your own and don't have to succumb to pressure to agree it's corny ... it's just an old-fashioned love story - enjoy!!",1012089600,63,868,4.587096774193548

I was disappointed that the people  writing the script chose to take the ""safe"" way out & have  Kelly Preston leave Hawk at the end.

They do relatively well until they come to a trading post and through pure ignorance, the husband is killed. Left on her own and 7 months pregnant Rebecca stays at the trading post where she meets a proud Cheyenne warrior, Soars Like A Hawk. When the trading post owner is killed she decides to stay there by herself.  Hawk tries to persuade her to come and stay with his people until the baby is born, but Rebecca insists that the post is where she will stay.  Hawk is attracted to her as a curiosity at first but then he leaves with his warriors.  He returns just before Rebecca has the baby and stays with her.  As the two become closer after the baby comes it is clear when other Cheyenne come to the post that neither are prepared to learn to adopt the ways of the other.
