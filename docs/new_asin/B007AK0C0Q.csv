8513440,1,B007AK0C0Q,"I have taken another, more forensic handwriting analysis class and liked it much better. It was not from Bart Baggett, it was from a lady (cannot recall her name) from the Center for Forensic Profiling agency. She trains police and has published over a dozen books. Both have good material in them though but I thought her class was much better. However I did do some Googling on Bart Baggett because I had initially seen him on TV. I found some disturbing things regarding ethics and my boss told me that I needed to be certified by someone more respected and that's how I ended up at the forensic place. I've since purchased many books from the same forensic place and have great results using them for my work. I guess it depends what you want to do with your training. If you are not going to do this work for professional reasons, Bart's would be good. If you are, I highly recommend the forensic place instead.",1331942400,2,916,4.491017964071856
