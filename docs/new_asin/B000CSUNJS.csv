8102198,5,B000CSUNJS,"All of the silly Boohbah characters and noises are so much fun.  And, as my kids are getting older, they are enjoying the little vignettes more and more.",1356998400,,153,4.464285714285714

8102200,5,B000CSUNJS,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of the 'Boohbah' - they're kind of creepy.  But, my granddaughter got into Boohbah's when she was one and has really enjoyed the video.  She's 2 and a half now and still loves watching the video, with understanding of the story lines more so now.  She enjoys imitating the boohbah movements during their segments too.  Despite their 'odd' appearance, I'd recommend the video!",1231200000,,417,4.671232876712328
8102201,4,B000CSUNJS,I bought this for my granddaughers ages 1 and 3.  They enjoyed this DVD.,1228003200,,72,4.142857142857143
8102202,5,B000CSUNJS,"I rented this from the local library and my first reaction was ""what the h*ll?""  But my son instantly took a liking too it and actually laughed hysterically at some scenes, which I never seen him do.  Usually he just smiles at a movie he likes.  So now we watch it together and we both act out the moves and have a ball.

This actually is educational if you take the time to talk through and explain what is going on so it isn't just a bunch of colors and silly people running across the screen.  I plan to order some for his collection.",1214352000,,537,4.125
8102203,5,B000CSUNJS,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this DVD, but I am very happy with my purchase. It is a bit on the strange side, but sometimes, it is the only thing that calms my 7 month old son down. He just stares at it. It is broken up into three 20 minute features which is nice. My 5 and 7 year old nieces really enjoyed it as well. They were dancing away with the BoohBahs and having a great time. I highly recommend this video.",1178668800,3,430,3.897727272727273
