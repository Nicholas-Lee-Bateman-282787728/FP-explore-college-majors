1921387,2,B0000D9PNS,"Based loosely on Arthur Schnitzler's text ""Reigen/Liebelei,"" Love In The Time Of Money depicts a human concatenation of sexual liaison between individuals who hardly know each other and could care less. And to what end? I, for one, could hardly decipher a reason for this exercise in existential malaise and gratuitous fornication. Despite the film's auspicious provenance (it credits Robert Redford as an executive producer and Sundance Institute as a progenitor), a cast of talented actors, and a moment or two of artistically consequential cinematography, I was thoroughly disappointed by what impressed me as a pointlessly languid depiction of desultory sex engaged in by aimless, unhappy people. Remarkably, Peter Mattei's direction and script were so poorly realized that even an inspired and almost always entertaining actress like Jill Hennessy turned in a performance that fell flat on its face in several early scenes of this woefully misguided project. Her painful, uncharacteristically self-conscious portrayal of an affection-starved wife on the prowl was, in fact, so stilted and motivationally confused that I was actually embarrassed for her as I forced myself to watch! There were, however, a few moments in the middle of the picture when I thought (hoped) that something of interest was germinating on the screen. As, for example, when Steve Buscemi in the role of an aspiring painter attempts to get Rosario Dawson, playing a secretary employed by the art gallery where he intends to show his canvases, to model for him. But once the tension in this duet of awkward seduction quickly and inevitably devolves into meaningless sex I was sadly reminded once again of how Mattei's vision of alienated 'love' refused to get out of its own way for even a minute's respite. ...I submit these comments as a service to those who are contemplating what I was unable to avoid.",1079136000,10,1884,5.2006578947368425

8000192,1,B0000D9PNS,"Spoiler Alert:

The film begins at a bleak intersection in New York where a prostitute has sex with a construction worker on top of his car.  In the next scene the construction worker has sex with a desperate housewife in her upscale apartment.  In the next scene the housewife doesn't have sex with her husband.  Next--the husband has sex with a male painter, (who says he isn't gay).  Next--the painter does it with the receptionist at an art gallery.  Next, she has an argument with her young boyfriend and tells him she is having sex with the painter.  Next, the young boyfriend meets an older psychic woman and goes home with her.  She wants to have sex with him but he ducks out at the last minute.  She takes a call and has phone sex with a suicidal stock broker.  Next, the stock broker meets the prostitute and asks her to kill him.

This is supposed to be profound!  Egad!  I can't believe Robert Redford was a producer of this tawdry mess.  I wonder if he really saw it.  The terrible thing, besides the hideous script, is that it uses some very good actors.  I hope they were well paid.",1388275200,2,1098,4.415
8000193,5,B0000D9PNS,"Good absorbing drama, not your run of the mill stufff, more outhouse style. The whole cast did a good job, the end wraps it all up nicely when....",1360454400,,146,4.25
8000194,3,B0000D9PNS,"That mostly shows peoples' romantic (more so than money) interests waxing and waning.  Some are reasonably happy and others quite sad.  It creates some fringe characters who don't quite ""fit in"" without being too depressing or vulgar.  There are no stand out performances but all the actors are solid.  If I have any beef it's that not much ever ""happens"" to most of them.",1342742400,,372,4.765625
8000195,3,B0000D9PNS,She's a really good actress. Not featured a lot in this movie but she steals the scenes she is in. This movie was pretty entertaining.,1307232000,2,134,4.4
8000196,5,B0000D9PNS,"To me, one of the best films I have seen.  The plot ties together every situation until it comes full circle.  I don't purchase many films but had to have this one after seeing in on cable.  Not a love story!",1225584000,,208,4.024390243902439
8000197,3,B0000D9PNS,"A collaged pastiche of events where everyone involved is connected to each other somehow, as you would guess after about the first 20-40 minutes of watching the movie (this idea is also used in Crash, but less effectively.)  Some of the ways people are trying to have a conversation or turn each other on or off is quite  comical.  There are too many short stories where I felt like I wanted them to develop the story more, but people would not have been interested in watching the entire thing then.  Also, to make a really good story for each scenario could have easily allowed the movie to go over 4 hours.  I guess it does leave room for many sequels or extra movies, but it's hard to make a collage and impress a critical audience.

You could tell the story had to be made to that everything would just connect together, and sometimes they had to stretch the storyline to make it come together in one collage.  Basically, the movie starts off with a whore who gets picked up by a contract worker, the contract worker later makes love to another's housewife, the husband of the housewife discovers more than art in an artist, the artist steals someone's girlfriend (Nick's girlfriend), Nick falls in love with a psychic, the psychic falls in love with a suicidal crook, and naturally the crook runs into you can probably guess which one of the characters.",1146873600,5,1359,4.590909090909091
8000198,5,B0000D9PNS,"I think the way people interact with each other in this film is direct, intuitive, and unpredictable, and that makes this film so interesting to watch, wondering what they do or say next. Although the expression is uninhibited, the film is never obscene or dirty at all. The sexual content in this film are all expressed naturally.

If you are interested in visual art you would enjoy the film. I like the characters in the film because they are all open minded, cultureally educated, honest, artistic and creative.

It is interesting that the prostitute that shows up in the beginning of the film reappears later on and plays a  role to the entire story. The structure of the sotry expansion is well made. I always enjoy a film when something you saw in the beginning finally makes sense in the middle or end of the film, and it is the case in this film.",1112313600,12,855,4.538961038961039
8000199,5,B0000D9PNS,"The existential outlook on love in NYC is crafted for the mind.  You are constantly surprised by the actions of the characters played by a group of my favorite actors (Jill Hennessey, Rosario Dawson, Malcolm Gets, and Steve Buscemi).  It gives off an ashen and contemporary aura which really pulled the movie together for me.  The film is like an abstract painting.",1098748800,8,365,4.854838709677419
