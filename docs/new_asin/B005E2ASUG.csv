8467840,5,B005E2ASUG,"I hosted a disco halloween party.  After a few hours of heavy duty disco dancing, half the party crashed in my living room where I had this DVD playing non-stop.  I couldn't believe how many people were gathered around that TV dancing in their seats and occasionally laughing really loud.  Everyone asked, ""WHERE did you find this?  This is great!""  I said, ""Amazon, of course.""",1383091200,5,378,4.753846153846154
