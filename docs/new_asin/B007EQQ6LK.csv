5079554,4,B007EQQ6LK,"If you are a Divynls fan you will want this DVD.  This review only addresses some bits of info that aren't apparent in the item description:

The video clearly was shot direct to video, on a tight budget, and with less than the highest quality video and audio gear.  While this must be an authorized video, the sound is very weak (worse than AM radio) and the video quality looks like 320x240 that has been crudely scaled up to DVD resolution.  Overall, only a cut above the typical bootleg job.

Also, the item description doesnt include a year-filmed date and only notes that the DVD was released in 2012.  The DVD jacket says it was shot in 1993 and that appears to be correct.",1367971200,4,680,4.443548387096774
5079555,5,B007EQQ6LK,I saw a lot of live music in the 90s but missed this great group. An excellent record of an excellent group.,1361836800,,108,3.9545454545454546
5079556,5,B007EQQ6LK,This is a fun concert movie from late in their careers.  Love the Divinyls.  Would like to see an earlier piece make it's way to DVD.,1358121600,3,133,4.076923076923077
5079557,4,B007EQQ6LK,"If crunchy guitar driven (see Les Pauls through Marshall amps) Rock/Pop is your cup of tea you may enjoy this as much as I do. Its the bonus of sexy and sultry lead singer Chrissie Amphlett strutting the stage like an extra in Showgirls that elevates this to the top of my ""in concert"" guilty pleasures!

I had a video of this show/concert for years... it was not available NTSC so I had to play it in an all region player and it got lost at some point.  When I saw this at a local record store today (Fingerprints Music in Long Beach CA ) I was actually hoping it wasn't a recent show but that show as it was a pretty excellent outing with first class production values and much closer in time (early '90s) to their hey day... and after popping it in my DVD player I can confirm it is.

Fans of the group will not be disappointed and I mostly wanted to write to say its legit and not one of those rip offs from ""Immortal"" with bad picture and often re-formated for wide screen. This is the old 4:3 and the way its shot cropping would be ridiculous as they really get in on the action.",1340928000,6,1085,4.132701421800948
5079568,4,B007EQQ6LK,"Production values could have been better in this concert with a really talented Aussie band. The Pretenders covered the Divinyls song ""Human"" which is kind of tragic considering Ms. Amphlett's too-early passing.",1439769600,,211,5.625

5079575,5,B007EQQ6LK,"The Divinyls are so underated, known for the one hit wonder for ""I touch Myself""...people seem to forget the large amount of work that came before or after. This live concert was a feast for the senses. Mark Mcentee is on top of his game as the lead guitarist, another that is underated...Amphlett is  circus of Voice and performance. Boggo exceeded expectations...sadly Christina Amphlett died in April 2013, so the Divinyls is no more, but this live concert is a great legacy.",1381449600,2,478,4.829268292682927
5079576,4,B007EQQ6LK,"First of all, if you are even a casual fan of Divinyls, you're going to want to own this DVD. It contains all of their hits, and this is an amazing live show. I've never seen such sustained sexuality in a female lead singer over the course of a concert, but I'm betting they had to hose Christina Amphlett down after the show was over. This is part of a three band show, but they still play a sixteen song, ninety minute set. The film is shot in full screen, and the sound is pretty decent stereo throughout the running time. There are, sadly, no extras included on this disc. It would have been fun to see a discography for those of us (including me) who are less familiar with their studio output. And it would have been nice to see some band member interviews, or some after show material. Here is some history of the band courtesy of Wikipedia.

Wikipedia
Divinyls were an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1980 and featuring vocalist Christina Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. As the focal point, Amphlett performed on stage wearing a school uniform and fishnet stockings, often using an illuminated neon tube as a prop and displaying aggression towards band members and the audience. The band, originally a five-piece, underwent numerous lineup changes with Amphlett and McEntee as the core members, before breaking up in 1996.

In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named ""Science Fiction"" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008.

Divinyls have released five studio albums, with four of them reaching the Top 10 in Australia and one, Divinyls, reaching No. 15 in the US. Their biggest-selling single, ""I Touch Myself"" (1991) achieved No. 1 in Australia, No. 4 in the US and No. 10 in the UK.

5079577,4,B007EQQ6LK,"Chrissie and company put on one heck of a show. The band sounds great whether in the studio or live, and this show is a testament to their musicianship. This recording is also a way to celebrate the life of Christina Amphlett, whose life was cut short earlier this year.",1368403200,,270,4.42

8515337,5,B007EQQ6LK,"Full disclosure - I can't stand I Touch Myself and Pleasure and Pain - the Divinyls two biggest hits. Those ""hits"" are in no way indicative of what a truly great band Divinyls actually are. Their first three albums (Desperate, What A Life, Temperamental) are chock full of rock nuggets that will get your toes a tappin and singing along.
This live concert is a pretty good example of their rock and roll chops on the big stage, even though it does include the aforementioned two tracks. Chrissy is in fine form throughout and Mark McEntee impresses on lead guitar with several extended solos. The whole band is exceptional and a special shout out to drummer Charley Drayton who kicks major butt.
One reviewer commented on the lousy sound and picture but it seemed fine to me. No Blu Ray treatment here but still a good overall presentation of a rockin band in peak form.",1460505600,2,870,4.619354838709677
8515338,5,B007EQQ6LK,"I became a fan of this band in the early 80s with their big hit, BOYS IN TOWN. All their LPs prove what great writers this duo was/is. Sadly, Christina passed last yr? in NYC, with what I thought, was not much fanfare for such a great musician, writer, entertainer. I saw them at the Stone Pony, Asbury Park, NJ, for the TOUCH MYSELF TOUR, 1989? It is a very crowd in yer face intimate scene. The women in the audience had for some reason set some of their pocket books in front of them on the stage. Christina took no time prancing out and going threw every purse as she could muster before gals were getting upset. W mic in one hand, still singing, she withdrew items, used lipsticks, showed belongings to crowd. It was a cute improve moment for a unique opening to that show!!  ""Had to be there"" moment.  RIP CHRISTINA, YOU LIVE ON....",1459209600,,838,4.3312101910828025
