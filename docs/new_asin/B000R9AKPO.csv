8199592,3,B000R9AKPO,"I am a huge Rod Stewart fan and have all his DVD's, CD's, been to a few of his concerts and read his autobiography.  This DVD has a few clips of his songs (short clips) and an interview and is entertaining if you want a chuckle out of his early years, I believe this is one of  the shortest DVD  that has  ever been made.  I was waiting for it to continue when I realized it was over.  It is less than 9 (nine) minutes long.  It should have been included as Bonus material on a music DVD of his.  Sorry Rod; still an enormous fan.",1391644800,,530,3.9339622641509435
