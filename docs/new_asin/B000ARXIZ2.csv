8079208,5,B000ARXIZ2,"Call me a dork, but I love watching movies in German. No, I don't speak German, and no this doesn't have subtitles, but I am a big fan of Once Upon A Time, the English version of this film, and getting to watch it in its original language is exciting. Did I mention that I am a dork?

If you are learning German or simply a fan of the movie's English version, this is a good buy. I was lame and didn't order the English version when Amazon had it available, and now I have to settle for the bad YouTube version of that, but hey, better than nothing!",1461456000,,549,4.036697247706422
