What you do in your youth and as a young adult can easily come back to haunt you - even if you left the gang life behind, enemies don't forget your face!

7947684,1,B00005NRNK,"In the 1980s, toy makers would purposely make cartoons about their products in order to get kids to want them.  On the Simpsons, they laughed at this:  ""Captain Chocobot, put down those wonder Mattel toys and go save the world!""  Here, I wonder if this so-called movie was just meant to advertise these Latino rappers from Northern Cal.  The credits say ""Darkroom Productions.""  One of the first lines in the film is a rapper saying, ""How can we get Darkroom off the ground?""  Then, other characters often wear clothes with Darkroom logos on them.  Yes, Fat Joe, Xhibit, and many other rappers have made bad movies.  Still, this so-called flick had so much bad acting, no plot, fake fight scenes, repetitiveness that it just boggles the mind.

This film steals elements from ""Boyz N Da Hood,"" with its drive-bys and escalating macho violence.  It may also imitate Eazy-E's life as he worked on the black market to fund his rap career.  Though one character speaks of black-brown unity, this film had no black characters, even though Northern Cal has a black population and black males are generally the top rap acts nationally.  Unlike every other ""hood"" film, this one had no female characters in it.  As much as these films generally advertise T&A, this is a shocker.  Moreover, why is almost every character fat and bald?

A character says, ""Now that we have an album and a album cover, how do we get larger?""  Another answers, ""Let's do interviews in the media!""  Hello!  How about giving a concert and making a local name for yourself?  Obviously, the film makers thought that would involve too many extras.  Also, all the rap is done a cappella.  The actors mention beats, but the film makers never provide any.  At most, this ""film"" may help those that want to break into the rap industry and don't reside in NYC or LA.",1158796800,3,1826,4.694006309148265
7947685,5,B00005NRNK,This movie is great. I just rented it at blockbuster and enjoyed it 4 times already. It's about two brothers trying to come up in the hood. They wanna be rappers and start a record label. But a shady drug dealer keeps giving them trouble. The music is tight too! 5 out of 5 stars. Definitely worth the rent.,1005264000,,307,4.220338983050848
