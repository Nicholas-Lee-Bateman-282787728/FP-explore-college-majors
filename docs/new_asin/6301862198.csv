Thank god they did though, otherwise they would have slipped into oblivion along with some of the bands that inspired them, like the incredible Bad Brains.  When I first heard these guys, it was like a bolt of lightning shot through me!  I was actually lucky enough to see them in concert twice (with Bad Brains).  Oh yeah, the video!  It does a great job of showing the band in action, and gives their story.  If you like hard, fast, rock and punk music, played by incredible musicians, this is your ticket!  I've heard rumours that they might tour with Bad Brains (Soul Brains) and Fishbone when they release their new album, please let it be true!",1054166400,4,827,4.54054054054054
