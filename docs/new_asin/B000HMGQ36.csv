8140516,5,B000HMGQ36,I thought it was a great story. Loved it the first time I saw it. When it was available I had to add it to my library. Too bad it wasn't Blu-ray.,1506038400,,145,3.5625
8140517,5,B000HMGQ36,This DVD is the documentary that I watched long ago about training two tigers in Africa to live in the wild who were born in captivity.  The experiment was a success despite the doubts of many 'professionals' in the field.  The story of the two tigers is nothing less than amazing and inspires hope for the future of tigers living in the wild.,1423094400,,343,4.428571428571429

8140519,5,B000HMGQ36,"One of the most interesting videos I've ever seen - the story of how domestic-bred Bengal tigers are re-conditioned to live in the wild, in the African grasslands instead of the jungles of India.  An incredible effort put forth to create the (huge) physical environment and the conditioning program.  Highly recommended.",1253836800,2,320,5.254901960784314
8140520,5,B000HMGQ36,"this is one of those documentaries that will amaze you to no limits, entertain you to the extreme and in the end put a sincere smile on your face on what the John Varty accomplished with his tigers in Africa. he took them as cubs from Toronto zoo to Africa where tigers have never roamed before, in order to train them to live there and hunt-kill animals for food. this dvd documents all the ups and downs of his struggle in training them. it also showcases amazing scenes of him and his team swimming and hunting side by side with the adult tigers, playing football with them, giving them medication and even taking away their food from them.

trust me, you will perhaps never see a better wildlife documentary than what is included in this dvd. it will truly amaze you what he accomplished in africa in this dvd.",1158278400,7,814,4.4630872483221475
