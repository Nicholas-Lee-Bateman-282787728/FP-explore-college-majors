6211183,5,B00HUCF7AO,Amazingly creative! I thought at my age I would trier of watching Sci-Fi this is not the case if movie's like Orphan Black and actors the likes of Tatiana Maslany continue to push the boundaries of entertainment.,1396137600,3,212,4.756756756756757
6211184,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I love it. Is so addictive. i cannot stop watching it. Im hooked. It reminds me of Breaking bad, but better until further notice..",1395878400,4,130,4.458333333333333
6211185,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Based on the orginal series this one should be a winner also!  A very slick British series with most of it taking place in the US
or what is made to look like the US.  Interesting storyline and a great cast.",1393459200,3,207,4.024390243902439
6211186,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Why does Amazon allow people to review products that don't exist? Somehow not only do they allow such things, but they actually sent me an e-mail suggesting I review this pre-ordered, non-existent product. (FYI, it's now February 12, 2014. The show begins April 19, 2014 and who knows when this DVD set is coming out? I figured by pre-ordering I'll get a good price by ordering as soon as possible.)

So, is this DVD set any good? Well, the first season was great but as I write it's the only season there is so far. So . . .

No idea. But I'll give this product four stars. Perhaps it deserves five. After all, no joke, season one was a truly great show and I was just blown away by it. If you haven't seen it, well, a) go see it as soon as possible, and, b) why are you checking reviews for the second season of the show when you haven't checked out the first yet? GO SEE THE FIRST SEASON!! IT'S FANTASTIC!!!

So, normally I'd give it five stars. --But I'll only give it four stars because . . . because it doesn't exist! I think that for a product to achieve five star perfection, well, it must be real, tangible and existent. Otherwise, well . . . it's about as good as that new novel that I haven't written yet.

(But, hey, don't blame me. Amazon's computer specifically *requested* that I review this because it saw I pre-ordered it! I'm only doing as asked.))

Anyway, I have seen the leaked writers' notes for the upcoming season.

I loved the part where the clones all hosted SNL. The part where they all died was upsetting though. I cried for weeks.

And, finally, if you haven't checked out season one, go do so. If you have, chances are you'll check out season two as well.",1392163200,25,1685,4.313291139240507

6211392,1,B00HUCF7AO,"It seemed like it was going to get interesting but never did. The should have wrapped the story up in one season instead of dragging it across four seasons with slow-to-no progress in each episode. Just same/similar story and action in every episode and got increasingly redundant, boring, and stupid. Any reasonable person would have gone to the police with the information. Everyone who's watched a slasher movie knows to ensure the killer is dead. There's no bad reason to skip this show.",1500768000,,491,4.927710843373494

I binged most of this over my SB & was sooo hooked.
I love how they kept everything in mind & was able to relate S1 stuff to S4 stuff.
S4 EP 1 has to be one of my favorites because they backtrack on Beth's story which I've been wanting since S1!
They did a great job at introducing bad guys & leading us to the top dog of the bad guys.
REALLY sad at the character deaths, but I guess it had to be done for certain relationships to continue.",1492646400,,486,3.919191919191919

The main character is so helpless and is good for nothing but having sex and telling everyone its non of their business or that they ""don't want to know"" what's wrong. If human cloning was illegal, then she could go to the authorities and expose the Dyad and all the other perverts that are the antagonists of the show. Sarah and the rest of the protagonists are incapable of fending anyone off and end up getting captured multiple times throughout the series by the same people and somehow get away each time but wind right back in their grasp just flailing around.",1489708800,2,651,4.52542372881356

Tatiana Maslaney is phenomenal; I honestly can't think of another actress who could pull off so many different characters in such a nuanced, distinctive way.  I am also particularly impressed by Jordan Gavaris as Felix.  In early episodes, I though that Jordan's performance, while entertaining, might be too broad to hold up over time.  However, his ability to interact differently with the various clones is genuinely impressive (his interactions with Alison are consistently hilarious).",1486252800,,583,5.51685393258427

The only thing I can say that is remarkable about the show is the versatility of the main actress in playing so many different roles. The premise is interesting (that's why I started watching it to begin with), but the story writing and production were bland. This show probably fails in my eyes partly because it was the next one I decided to watch after having watched Mr. Robot and Westworld.

6212664,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Tatiana Maslany should get the golden globe for her acting.  She may well be the best actress in history.  I have seen many actors try to do different characters but they seem to do it in an overt way, too much charicature, or on the other extreme, too subdued.  Tatiana makes deep characters that have a history the milisecond they appear on screen.  I have NEVER in my life seen an actress accomplish what she has.  You have to see it to believe it.

On top of it, I love every character in the show.  Well acted, well written, so much cool variety.  Investigations, plot twists, character developments, it has it all.  You get to know both the main characters and their enemies and every character gets his or her fair chance to show how he or she believes and thinks.  Few shows in the last few decades have been written so well.

Thank you to the writers and to Tatiana for bringing such a wonderful show forward",1482192000,,917,4.398809523809524

6212882,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Not as amazing as Season 1, if only because seeing Maslany in the various roles loses its initial shock value, and the one-dimensionality of some of the characters (Kira, Felix, Vic) is a little more apparent. Still, you basically have to see it after Season 1, and if anything the plot and pacing is a bit more on point and the suspense is if anything racheted up a notch.",1480291200,,373,4.420289855072464

First of all, it's pretty amazing the same actress plays almost all of the characters - kudos to her because she does a great job making them all seem like truly unique individuals.

I seriously love Helena and the music played each time she ""takes someone out"" always deserving. Please keep her....her one liners are hysterical. Don't know why you got rid of Paul.

Come on, people. It's the job: the script calls for you to act a certain way, you do. Why is it considered something ""amazing"" to see the main character play many different roles, as if she's not an actress and was just tossed into the role? She's a professional actress!  Nothing surprising or special in this series, despite all the reviews making it seem like you will just *die* if you don't immediately recognize the GENIUS that is Orphan Black! This series is just so-so for me.",1476921600,,818,4.602739726027397

6214036,4,B00HUCF7AO,I am joy the show. I find that television mysteries are generally frustrating because they are plot not character driven.  Off of the characters out of the trailer true nature to get the plot to work. Or just seems like the show was withholding energy or information to keep us hooked. But if in black it's better and better as it goes on and like a show like lost that just got more jumbled  Tatiana's performance is so impressive and the stories are so fun that it keeps me watching.,1474934400,,485,4.377777777777778

6214102,4,B00HUCF7AO,"I didn't actually order this.  My wife did.

Normally I'd give a crap review to her shows, because she becomes kind of obsessed with them and doesn't go out and enjoy life.  In this case, I must admit, the show really delivers.

I've only seen portions of a couple of episodes, but from what I've seen, the writing and plot is intriguing and fresh.  The acting, especially the main, is superb.  She subtly delivers a different persona for several characters and pulls it off seamlessly.  Jumping between drama and humour (sometimes dark) the story is always thrilling and unexpected.

So, I have no choice but to give it numerous stars.  If I liked dramas more it would have received 5 stars, but I don't, and so I haven't actually watched much of it.",1474848000,,751,4.586466165413534

It has excitement, titillation, the unexpected at every scene change, extraordinary acting and storylines. It's a sci-fi thriller, conspiracy, occasionally humorous, sexy, all the good stuff. It's for all discerning watchers - I am 68 and my daughter, age 37, turned me on to it. For all but the young and impressionable. No prudes allowed. It's a bit raunchy, but never offensive.

6214452,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I'm reviewing the series from the start to the end of season two.  The series starts a little slowly, so give it five or six episodes and then you'll be hooked.  The intrigue and interwoven plot lines are reminiscent of Person of Interest, which also took five or six episodes to mature into full bloom.

Minor spoiler alert if haven't watched season one:  Tatiana Maslany deserves an Emma nomination for her roles.  She is completely convincing in each of her many roles.  When she plays one of her roles badly attempting to impersonate one of her other roles, you get to see how completely she compartmentalizes her roles, being able to convincingly portray a role unconvincingly pretending to be a role that she plays all the time.  Almost mind boggling.

By season two you think you've got all the players kind of sorted out, only to be thrown a few new curves.  Looking forward to jumping into Season Three.",1474070400,,912,4.685534591194968

When I was first told about this production by a friend, the subject matter seemed strange and of no interest to me.  I did watch the first episode on the recommendation and was immediately hooked.  This is sooooooooooooo well done.  My only caveat is this:  I'm currently watching Season 3.  I understand Season 4 is something one must pay for, which seems strange as the first three were included as part of the Prime Subscription.  As this is the first streaming I've done using Amazon, I wish they had just included the whole series.  I will definitely be checking this type of thing out before I watch anything else.  It didn't feel right to find out that after you've watched three seasons, you couldn't watch the ending without a charge.  Other than that, I'd recommend this as one of the best productions out there.",1473638400,,901,4.748387096774193

Tatiana Maslany is a revelation as the main character(s) and has been nominated for an Emmy in both 2015 & 2016. Forget all that hype, watch the show and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed. Orphan Black is not your typical sci-fi thriller; it's unpredictable, seriously you've got to pay attention to keep track; it's inventive and contemporary; and it's funny, I was pleasantly surprised (it kind of reminded me of Fringe in that regard). This show puts The Blacklist and Blindspot to shame, but the main reason to watch is the star, Tatiana Maslany, and the range this woman has in her presentation of the 6 clones that inhabit the Orphan Black world.",1473638400,,747,4.666666666666667

VAGUE SPOILER WARNING

Also slavery is illegal in this vague (Canadian/British/American) environment, so a patent on a gene isn't going to give you government-enforced ownership of a person or a part of a person. At this point, the Dyad Institute seems to be sliding into the evil corporation trope with a bit of Matrix-Merovingian flavoring, while the Clones try to maintain their mellow suburban or urban street or sophisticated academic lifestyles. While in the shadows lurk the pseudo-religious psychotics.",1471737600,,729,5.385964912280702

How she can convincingly portray so many different characters in the same show is a mystery to me, plus she has incredible energy.

Things happen so quickly, and it's sometimes difficult to understand the words.  I'm afraid I'm going to wear out my rewind button.",1470096000,,481,4.734939759036145

6215521,4,B00HUCF7AO,I would give this show a 5 star rating.  It's so incredibly interesting.  The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is because there's too much of pushing the gay/lesbian lifestyle.  I'm sorry if that offends someone but it's my opinion.,1470009600,,233,4.634146341463414

There is some violence and some sexual content, but it is muted enough that I don't find it unwatchable. I wouldn't say it's tastefully done, but it isn't gratuitous, so it doesn't detract from the story line.

6215891,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I LOVE this show. Looking forward to season 4 being released on Prime. I binge watch this with a vengeance. I think I am on my third time through watching this series.

Tatiana is amazing and plays so many characters so well. She can even manage to play one character pretending to be another without falling completely into that roll. Somehow she is able to add just enough so things don't feel quite right, but you question if you would notice that if you didn't know she was pretending to be someone else.

The script is very well written and executed. The scenes with multiple clones are well edited and very rarely can you tell that they aren't all in the same scene at the same time.

Helena has become one of my favorite characters in the show.",1469318400,,751,4.427536231884058
6215892,5,B00HUCF7AO,"So well acted and so well written,  it really stands out in the sea of today's mediocrity.  Sad,  but happy that season five is the end and it won't be driven into the usual banality of other once succesful shows",1469318400,,212,4.25

6215932,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Tatiana is a terrific actress and really does make you feel like each of the roles she portrays in this series are unique characters; plus she's hot! I think season 1 of Orphan Black was the most intriguing season and seasons 2 does a good job of picking up and fleshing out the setting and the narrative of the story line. It's sort of a ""Sci-fi lite"", as far as science fiction goes. It's all about biological science fiction and not much in the way of technology and stuff. Although, they do seem to be running some pretty sophisticated gene sequencing applications on simple laptop computers that I'd imagine would be relegated to super computers in a real world situation.",1469318400,,677,4.65

6215951,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Clearly, the acting here is not top rate, nor is the writing, and yet . . . it's got something, you know, that something that you can't put your finger on, but it keeps you coming back.  For one thing, you cannot guess where it's going.  Anybody can die at any time, and they do.  Also, it doesn't take itself tooo seriously.
And it's also interesting to see the various shades of Sarah/Tatiana.  I get the sense this show is short on rehearsal time, which is odd for a BBC production.  It so wants to be really good, and I think she would be.
So, it's kept me watching anyway.",1469318400,,577,4.209090909090909

I am baffled as to why it has not been picked up by a major USA network.  it is a canadian produced and BBC product. If, this show was considered for USA TV awards, it would have swept the awards for best actress, best writing, best production, the last 4 years, hands down.

Once you start watching you can not stop. every time you think you have figured out who the real bad guys are, the plot twists.

Questions from season 1 will be answered,  but every revelation points to an even greater mystery.",1467676800,,293,4.82

6216818,5,B00HUCF7AO,Cool show.,1467676800,,10,4.5
6216819,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This is the most amazing series, due in large part to the incredible performance(s) of Tatiana Maslany. Watching a scene between Sarah and Helena it's sometimes hard to accept that they're both being played by the same actress - even when you're constantly reminding yourself. She not only plays 9 separate and distinct clones so far (with 2 more still to come), but to increase the level of difficulty, she also plays the clones impersonating each other. Sarah pretending to be Rachel is not quite Rachel, but in a different way than Alison pretending to be Rachel. Cosima as Alison slightly off but in a way that lets you ""see"" Cosima behind Alison. It's truly amazing.

It's said that Spencer Tracy once appeared on stage in a play where he was supposed to be stranded on a desert island in the second act and he ""acted"" unkempt and unshaven to the point where people wondered how he got his make-up done that quickly. Tatiana Maslany accomplishes something similar. Cosima is thinner and prettier than the other clones. Helena is thicker and more solid. Alison is the most petite. Sarah taller. And then there's Tony.

Orphan Black is not just a one woman show, however. Jordan Gavaris is wonderful as her ""brother"" Felix, supportive to all the clones and never complaining as he takes a back seat to the force of nature that is Sarah Manning. The other supporting actors, too, are always interesting, whether it's Mrs. S proving again and again that she's hiding much more than she's ever revealed or Detective Bell learning just how little he actually knew about Beth Childs.

A typical episode might have Cosima dying from a genetic disorder, Sarah being chased by murderous assassins, Helena being tortured by religious fanatics and Alison . . . Alison organizing visitation day in rehab or supplying the proper refreshments for her kids' soccer practice. The fact that all 4 story lines are equally compelling is a sign of the quality of the show's writing and production. This is must see TV.",1467676800,3,2002,4.813953488372093

Helena shows up in Rachel's apartment just in time to save the heroine from Rachel's henchman even though Helena could not get there from the previous scene where she was seen running on foot into the woods in the middle of nowhere. The writers and taking too much license with the story to keep it interesting while exceeding my ability to suspend disbelief. When it gets to the level where any 12 year old could have written it, I lose interest.

She is so convincing that I sometimes forget the fact that many of the characters are being played by the same actress. I've grown to adore and root for many of the characters and despise the same number. The intrigue stays fresh and grips you like a soap opera to the point you realize your binge watching episodes back to back.

There's no questioning the story engineering on this show, and as everybody knows, Tatiana Maslany is the world's greatest victim of Awards Overlook. However, after going through the whole first season and part of the second, I can't help getting weary of how overwrought it is. No matter how much is happening or how high the emotional stakes, the directors seem to feel that you can never have enough melodramatic dialog, pounding music, scowling if not frantic actors, intense composition and editing, etc. Dialing it back and trusting in the situation to keep the viewer on the hook--or even just modulating it a little--just doesn't seem to occur to them.

6217809,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This season was actually BETTER than season one. I honestly didn't think it was possible for me to become more intrigued with this show than I already was; but Orphan Black gets better with each episode. I want Felix for my own screwed up but overwhelmingly compassionate and loyal brother. Mrs. S is a triumph of the gun-toting, murderously protective, secret keeping foster mother character. And Tatiana Maslany is absolutely masterful in her portrayal of a numerous group of clones. This actor is so good that the viewer can tell right away which character Tatiana is playing by a single micro-expression on her face. This isn't science fiction or in any way strange. It is pure, addictive, self-indulgent drama. My daughter and I count the hours when we have to wait for the next episode to air.

6217851,3,B00HUCF7AO,"I loved season one, good science fiction. Tatiana's acting is amazing playing 5 or 7 different roles and sometime playing one character playing another!. The writers also bring a lot of what-if question into play. Unfortunately, the season 2 plot is getting a bit soap-opera-ish -- never resolving an issue before other issues comes up that makes you no longer care about the prior issues, and doing ""the changeling"" thing in which good guys become bad and bad guys become good. I'll watch one episode of season 3 but I think it's a lost cause.",1465689600,3,544,4.7368421052631575

6217856,5,B00HUCF7AO,This is this best series I've seen in years. Absolutely brilliant. Both funny and frightening. Thought provoking and emotionally charged. Part mystery/detective story. Part sci-fi. The over arching plot involves cloning humans which isn't really that sci-fi in this day and age. Covert groups fighting to keep and uncover secrets. Extremely well cast. Action. Drama.

6218109,5,B00HUCF7AO,"It is difficult to write about Orphan Black with the clarity and precision it deserves. It is from episode to episode immaculately paced and completely engaging. Character development is uniformly complex and complete.  Across the first three seasons, it is not easy to find comparable storytelling that spins such heightened dramatic tension and brings the characters into such vibrant relief.

The cast is without exception, superb. Tatiana Maslany is terrific in her multiplying roles. Jordan Gavaris is captivating as the most composed participant in the story's wild maelstrom,  yet manages to deliver an extrordinary vulnerability when it serves the story.

I am completely taken with this show. It is a rare gem even in the current surfeit of fine episodic television. Give it one episode. You'll know.",1464825600,,809,5.346456692913386

6218514,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I like Orphan Black because it picks up a point in our reality today that is not talked about much, that is cloning. Like Person of Interest, it clues us in on real time events that, unless something earth shattering happens with it, most people pass over it without much, if any thought. I like programs that explore parts of our reality that we give little thought to but exists and impacts how we live and will live our lives. The story line of Orphan Black is interesting and sometimes perplexing with the twists and turns. Alaina, my favorite is offbeat, a little psychotic and helariously funny and incredibly sad. At first, I thought the adding of the male clones was a stretch; however, it would be logical that if scientist could clone females, why not males as well. Sometimes the story line gets bogged down. But in light of what regular TV is offering up as entertainment, I will take a show like Orphan Black any day, hands down. It's different and well acted by Tatiana Maslany. I marvel how she plays each clone so convincingly with each being so unique and quirky. And the technology and level of brain power to bring this all together.

6218523,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This might be my favorite series of all time. Tatiana Maslany does an incredible job of acting all the different versions of herself. As another reviewer mentioned, most amazing is the way when she's playing Hilary impersonating Sarah or Sarah impersonating Rachel, that's exactly what you see, not Tatiana playing either Sarah or Rachel. Her portrayal of each of the different characters is so well-developed and unique that Hilary impersonating Sarah has just the right level of ""wrongness"" relative to the normal Sarah character to be convincing as a Hilary trying to do the stand-in. I'm not at all one to wax euphoric over actors' performances, but Maslany is absolutely masterful here. I think it's one of the most impressive examples of the craft of acting I've ever seen. Oh - the story and plot line is engaging and fun as well, with bits of nicely understated humor here and there. Very highly recommended.",1463529600,,916,4.954545454545454

I got through the whole first season on one leg of the journey. As soon as I got home I started Season 2.

The lead actress is amazing!  She plays many parts, all very well.  I highly recommend this show if you like sci-fi, fantasy, drama and tongue in cheek comedy!",1463443200,,438,4.154761904761905

6218596,3,B00HUCF7AO,"After an excellent Season 1, Season 2 is a letdown through a whole 7 episodes.  I almost stopped watching it, but my wife assured me that Season 3 rocks, and Rotten Tomatoes also mirrors that Season 2 is a drop but Season 3 gets it back.  So, I pushed through, and episodes 9 and 10 of Season 2 actually do get everything back on track.  Literally, this was becoming a trainwreck, and then they fixed it.

I give 3 stars because the first 6 episodes are so tedious, they even make Felix boring.  When Allison, the most humdrum character becomes the most interesting one, you know there are issues.  Still, they literally get everything back on track in the last 2 episodes.  So 1 star for the early episodes, but 5 stars for the ending, arriving at 3.

Just push through them, and I hope Season 3 is as good as promised.",1463356800,,820,4.348684210526316

6218613,5,B00HUCF7AO,"The premise seems to be based on the question of nature vs. nurture- ""who would you be if you were not in the life you currently know?""  So you might be uptight, totally mellow, a cop or a criminal (all versions of the clone in the show). Skinner said, ""Give me a child and I will give you back a thief, a pope or a poet.""  This show takes that idea of operational conditioning and runs it in a conspiracy filled way, adds twists, drama and intrigue and spits out Orphan Black.

It is really hard to tell the good guys from the bad, and even the obvious good guys are faced with highly difficult situations in which they have to do some pretty horrible things.

6218912,3,B00HUCF7AO,"The series started out okay but has sort of devolved into the quality of a made-for-tv movie, meaning not that great.  I do like seeing Tatiana Maslany morph into new character clones and she does a pretty good job of it, but beyond that the storyline seems kind of hokey at times.  Heavy gay-lesbian scenes which seem a bit contrived at times.  The storyline at this point seems to be going all over the place--I keep waiting for an unexpected twist or clever bringing together of all the side stories, but it hasn't happened yet.",1462406400,,531,4.568421052631579

6218916,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Season two felt really rushed, as in there was SO much going on in every episode that it lost it's ability to feel real. I love the premise, but it was very hard to keep up with the amount of plot twists and turns. It was as if the writers just took a list of the things that were supposed to be fixed, like deaths, and said ""let's make all of this null and void."" However, their 'twists' were too often and felt cheesy after about the second one.",1462406400,,447,4.033707865168539

6218928,4,B00HUCF7AO,"This season brings a lot of the characters origins and motivations into perspective, but more questions raised than answered about the institutions involved. I definitely think Tatiana Maslany has even further improved (already pretty great) character work, but of course we spend the most time with Sarah and her perspective, so it's still hard for other clones to feel as fleshed out. I further enjoyed how the divergent story lines weaved together this season and the significant shifts in power dynamics that occurs across multiple relationships. I know that last sentence seems vague, but I had to avoid spoilers - just watch for  yourself!",1462406400,,645,5.201923076923077

6218992,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This show is so intense that season 2 is BETTER than season 1, which I didn't think could be possible since Season 1 was so amazing. LOVE this show and recommend for thrillers, drama, etc. Do note, it is very violent, there is a lot of explicit language, some nudity and very adult subject matters (multiple) - so definitely NOT suitable as a family show. There is 1 element they brought in this season which I don't think worked very well at all, but don't want to give away spoilers. It didn't last long anyway, so was a blip in the overall scheme of things. Otherwise Fast-paced, adventurous & always leaves you wanting more....",1462320000,,631,4.543859649122807

6219141,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This series just keeps getting better and better as the characters of Sarah Manning and her ""sisters"" reveal more of their histories and the plot twists keep piling up.
I'm not sure exactly where the series is headed - and that's a good thing. The reason: The problem with many contemporary television programs, in my opinion, is that after a season of surprises subsequent seasons begin to get predictable. It's as though the writers have run out of ideas and are only continuing the program because they have a network deal and contract obligations to fulfill. This is not the case - at least so far - with ""Orphan Black."" Season 2 contained at least as many surprises as the first season and perhaps a few more. A transgender ""sister?"" A killer who is good with children? A little girl who seems almost too good to be true? A much younger ""sister?"" A parallel experiment with men instead of women? Reunions, bar fights, kidnappings... this season has all that and more; full of fresh ideas, push-the-envelope story lines, and terrific acting not only by series star Tatiana Maslany but the rest of the cast as well add up to a wonderful bloc of episodes.
One quick note: Although the nominal heroine of the series is Sarah Manning, I have to say that her ""sister"" Helena is rapidly becoming my favorite clone. Granted, she's homicidal and as unstable as a bowl of Jell-O, but she is also vulnerable and endearing in many ways. She reminds me a lot of Helen King, the protagonist in novelist Sharon Brownlie's book ""Betrayal,"" because when she is wronged she goes after those that have harmed her with a take-no-prisoners fierceness that is rarely seen on television. Add to that the fact that Maslany has an almost uncanny ability to portray her as something more than a homicidal maniac and you have a character that is unique in television programming.
The verdict: A great season that is probably even better than the first.",1462060800,6,1930,4.729970326409496

I'm kinda picky, but the writing, plotting, pacing, and the acting continue to be absolutely top notch. No spoilers, but Tatiana Maslany just keeps getting more and more amazing, in all her roles. Acting-wise, she can apparently do pretty much anything -- and I really do mean ANYthing!
In fact, all the actors are awesome, across the board, and manage the sometimes-absurdly-quirky twists and turns of the plot without breaking stride. However incredibly unlikely the situation, the actors pull it off -- make you believe it.

And now, as the plot continues to thicken, emotions intensify, and the stakes escalate, I've got my fingers crossed that the whole ensemble can keep the quality soaring for the third season.

Tatiana Maslany is certainly incredible and deserves her Emmy. I am not sure if it's Helena or Alison who makes me laugh harder, and the bounce from tragedy to comedy is unrelenting, so for me the show is hard to binge on. I can only take one episode at at time. Some of the plot flaws become so glaring there have been a few episodes when I am on the verge of giving up and discarding the whole show, and then Alison does something so hilarious, or Helena something so outrageous that I find myself cheering and laughing aloud. So I am still in the mix. The advent of the male version is a mistake. Too much, too far, over the top, silly. That's one that made me consider giving up on the show. There is so much to do already with the characters and the plot line and the corporate threat that this silly addition becomes ludicrous and stupid.

6219268,3,B00HUCF7AO,"It was an enjoyable story.  The numerous turns in the story was a bit too much.  The many facets of the clones was at first interesting, but it got tiresome later on.  At times it seemed as new clones were created to prolong the series and added little to the story.  The underlying social-political agenda on LGBT was a bit tiresome, culminating on a hermaphrodite on Season 3.  Dear me, how many issues are they taking on.

If it runs out of creativity and just gets cancelled, it will still be a top ten for me personally, if for no other reason than Maslany's acting. I'm saddened that Helena, the woman I've been waiting a lifetime for, isn't real.

Although the title was intriguing, the synopses I read were not, so I never bothered to watch it before this. What a mistake! This series is brilliant, ingenious, addictive, utterly unique. Tatiana Maslany obviously has the toughest job: she plays a host of different characters so flawlessly you actually forget it is she who is portraying them all. But the rest of the cast is pitch perfect too. The viewer is constantly shocked by new plot twists, shocking scenes of bloody mayhem, and it is impossible to tell the goodies from the baddies. Orphan Black is smart, full of wit and humor and the science is so plausible, it could even be true!",1461715200,,714,4.674603174603175

My only ""complaint"" is that I thought it was suppose to be set in the USA. But it clearly isn't. The money they use is obviously not American, the scenery and cities are not recognizable as American, and even the places they go are like pubs and not American bars.

I decided to give the show a try after seeing Tatiana Mislay on Colbert and discovered it is much more of a mystery/whodunnit. There is some humor and little romance, but at its heart it is a mystery. Tatiana Maslany is simply outstanding, giving each one of the clones she plays a unique personality. I am hooked.",1461369600,,427,4.417721518987341
6219443,1,B00HUCF7AO,"Really bad season so far. I'm on episode 6 of Season 2 of ""Orphan Black,"" and it's a struggle! To be honest I feel like this season is pure garbage, but according to the Amazon reviews 83% of more than 11,000 people gave season 2, 5 stars. To me, that means there is something that I'm missing. Unfortunately 6 episodes in, and I'm still missing it. The main story line for this season is so slow, and a lot [and I mean a lot] of the sub-plots and character behavior doesn't make any sense. For instance, Helena is a mentally deranged mass murderer. Why is Sarah trusting her? or talking to her? or not actively figuring out a way to turn her over to Interpol? I don't know. I mean, also, where is the law in all of this? I feel like the Death Star could open fire on half of the town, and the police would ignore it. Because you know... reasons. I'm not trying to be a troll, but I feel like this season is just pure garbage. Everything happens with soap opera convenience. No one asks any questions. People show up at the right times, say the right things, don't die from major crashes, and loads of other ridiculous and unbelievable stuff. I'm going to finish this season on an upcoming weekend when I have time again, but, I can't recommend this season to anyone.

Also, Season 2, Episode 5, ""Ipsa Scientia Potestas Est."" I don't care if the character Paul didn't say 'No' -- Rachel is a rapist. Black-mailing Predator Rachel didn't even let 'No' be an option for Paul.",1461369600,3,1473,4.375912408759124

6219515,5,B00HUCF7AO,"LOVE this series!  The main character's actress is FANTASTIC!  It's AMAZINGLY EASY to keep all of her characters separate in my mind, and she NAILS each one of them!  And when one of her character's ""pretends"" to be another (via a purposeful switcheroo role play), it'll FOOL you --- BUT, after you catch on, you CLEARLY see what you missed about a particular persona that SHOULD have clued you in on the ""role playing"".  She's THAT GOOD, and the plot and all of its twists are extremely engaging.  My favorite character is Helena! She's bad-ass and nutz and adorable, and hilarious, and demonic and vulnerable ALL AT ONCE. Allison is a close second favorite! This is a #MUSTWATCH",1461110400,,680,4.728813559322034

6219547,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Good series. I like the characters. What I also like about watching the series on Amazon Prime is that as you get into the plot of the show and it's characters, you can't just stop watching after one episode because you're too intrigued to see what's going to happen on the next episode. It's so addicting when you get into a good shiw. It's almost like a cliff hanger. The anticipation of what's next keeps asking for more. You almost hate to see the serie end. Actress, Tatiana Maslany is very versatile in playing all of the various characters in the show. It's almost scary. Kind of reminds you of Sally Field when she played in the movie ""Sybal""",1461110400,,650,4.470588235294118

The role of women and their perspectives are also highlighted in the series.  The technology behind having the same actress play multiple roles that are often seen in the same scene is quite amazing and seamless.

Tatiana Maslany is a wonderful actress, who plays a number of roles, sometimes simultaneously, as a series of clones. She really makes the most of the well written scripts.  I'm sure she would have an Emmy or two if this series were on a major network and not BBC America on cable. The supporting cast of mostly Canadian actors is also quite good and often serves as comic relief for this dark tale Anyone who enjoys science fiction, fantasy, or a suspenseful thriller will like this series, but set aside some time because this one is worth a serious binge.!",1461024000,,682,4.628099173553719

I was pretty skeptical about this show, but after watching even the first episode, I had to watch the next one, and the next...and the next! When it comes down to it, Orphan Black is more than just discovering the clones, or who is behind it (although it is a big deal), but the relationships that are built from season one until now. Tatiana makes it so believable that you can really tell the difference from Sarah, Cosima, Alison, and Helena. I unsubscribed Amazon Prime a year and a half ago, but signed up for a free trial because I found that season 3 is now available lol. Yes, that's how good it is. Must watch!!",1461024000,,699,4.46875

6220104,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Tatiana Maslany is a master of lead and character acting, which makes this show tremendously fun to watch. Were it not for her strength playing most of the major roles in the show, it easily could have flopped. I predict a long career for her when the show one day wraps up. As an American, I was not familiar with her work, although I gather she has a had a few other roles in Canada.

On the show itself, I'll just say it's refreshing to see a well done science fiction program. Too often the category is relegated to campy, low budget productions for the Sci-Fi channel. Orphan Black elevates the sci-fi TV program to a viable vehicle. I hope it will lead to more programming in the category.",1457308800,,695,4.387596899224806
6220105,5,B00HUCF7AO,This is absolutely my favorite show!  It has such a unique story line and that keeps you guessing.  I love the twists and turns the story line takes but it is still cohesive.

6220112,2,B00HUCF7AO,A complex and interesting plot that hits all the PC buttons with glowing presentations of both male and female homosexuality.  The multiple characters played by the leading actress is an admirable achievement but borders on the ridiculous and becomes detracting as the story moves forward.  For me the negatives outweigh the positives and the overall story isn't really worth your time.,1457308800,,386,5.311475409836065

Knowing that nowadays it is possible to implant a woman with a fertile egg to produce a beautiful baby, cloning is just a short step away! As with most things in life there will always be those that have their own rational for doing what they shouldn't and those who want the ultimate control. So easily could cloning become this story, this disaster! The actress was amazing, playing all these parts and making them believable, making you care for each of them.

6220351,4,B00HUCF7AO,in the sci-fi ghetto as far as MSM recognition goes.  Maslany triumphs in her ability to portray - how many? - 7 and counting characters and interacts with them in frame routinely; unparalleled technical cinematography and acting disclipine.  Peter Sellers is envious; Stanley Kubric is envious.  The screen writers here would've love to have them on board to create a more interesting plotline.,1455580800,,395,5.238095238095238

6220394,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Orphan Black is an awesome show (at least the first two seasons).

Season 2, I feel, really finds this show in its stride. Maslany continues to expertly weave all the characters' personalities into the scenes and there are some pretty tense moments.  To not give anything away - but it will make sense later - some events that left me stunned:  accidental shooting, pencil by MacGyver, donation, animal prod, and cliff-hanger.

I look forward to Season 3",1455408000,,599,5.02020202020202

If it's one actress, she's a true actor for she seems so very different in each character.  Wasn't sure that I wanted to folllow the second season, but did, and enjoyed.

It was if there was no real plan other riders to tell a story. They were just playing it by year. Incredibly disappointing.

6220781,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I am a late bloomer concerning Orphan Black. When season 1 first began I set it up on my DVR figuring it was a new and exciting Sci-Fi show. After a few episodes of clones without knowing the whys or hows, I stopped watching. To many unanswered questions. Fast forward to 2015-16 and I've just concluded seasons 1 and 2. I am now hooked. What caused the turn-around? Primarily, the superb acting of Tatiana Maslany and her supporting cast (especially the young girl who plays her daughter). If an Oscar could be given for a TV series, Ms. Maslany would be up for best actress. She has done an outstanding job bringing humanity, pathos, and believability to all the characters she plays. I actually feel I'm watching clones even though intellectually, I know I'm not. A great example is episode 10 of season 2. The sister clones dance and each one dances differently depending on the type of character.

The story line contains enough suspense and conspiracy theory to keep X-Files afficionados happy. Spoilers - what is known after season 2 is a corporation is trying to clone females and a part of the military is trying to clone males. Female clones cannot have children (except Sarah who is a ""failure"" and has given birth to a daughter). That is why she is a scientific oddity and people are willing to do whatever is necessary to understand why she is different and what makes her and her daughter's physiology tick.

I need a short break from the suspense and then I will enthrall myself with season 3. Give the series a chance. I think you will find the show a must watch.",1453593600,,1579,4.595744680851064

Keeps you wanting more.  If you are thinking of watching Orphan Black, start at season 1 episode 1.  If you don't you will be list lost and thinking it's not worth watching....  But it is.  We are hooked and going to pay for season 3, yes that good.",1453507200,,415,4.256410256410256

6220828,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Brilliant writing, brilliant acting, especially the lead actress, though the cast is uniformly great.  How many distinct roles can one actress play and do them all brilliantly?  I'd hate to be her therapist when this is over.  Not sure who makes this, the BBC?  Putting American production to shame, that something this intelligent (and this sexual!) could air on network television.",1453507200,,383,5.229508196721311
6220829,5,B00HUCF7AO,Best show I've seen in a long time. Tatiana Masalany is an amazing actress. The story is full of twists and turns. It keeps me on the edge of my seat. It's hard to believe it's a television series and not a major film.,1453507200,,218,3.977272727272727

6220855,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I've become addicted to this quirky series. The primary actor, Tatiana Maslany is simple remarkable as she convincingly portrays several different ""sisters."" The characters are well fleshed out and the acting is so seamless that when a new character was introduced, it often took several moments to realize that it was the same actress.

There are other fun, scary and dynamic characters that make this show so very different and so very interesting.

I highly recommend and cannot wait until Amazon Prime offers Season 3 for no cost.",1453507200,,534,5.056818181818182

The main actress plays several characters (often with them interacting together) and she pulls it off flawlessly.  Even without the backdrop of such an interesting show, just watching her transform into several different characters is enough to keep a person mesmerized.

6220998,5,B00HUCF7AO,"What will happen once human cloning becomes scientifically feasible?

That question is addressed with chilling logic in BBC America's superb sci-fi thriller Orphan Black as it enters into its second season. And it ain't pretty.

Tatiana Maslany plays multiple roles as clones - we've met seven so far - created by a powerful conglomerate named Dyad and its scary head scientist, Aldous Leekie (Matt Frewer).

Set in Toronto, Orphan Black is told principally through the eyes of one of the clones, English-born grifter and single mother Sarah Manning.

The story opened last season as a fascinating mystery. At loose ends for money, Sarah one day witnesses an identical-looking woman, police detective Beth Childs, commit suicide. Intending only to empty her bank accounts, Sarah grabs Beth's wallet and keys and assumes her identity. She soon finds herself enmeshed in a deadly conspiracy.

Beth had discovered she was one of more than a half dozen clones, human beings owned by Dyad - the company holds the patent on their DNA. Sarah also learns that Dyad has kept tabs on the clones since birth by inserting its agents into their lives to become their husbands, lovers, and friends.

Maslany is riveting as the different clones, each with her own look, her own idiosyncracies, quirks, and speech patterns.

There's Alison Hendrix, an uptight, pill-popping suburban housewife and amateur actress; Cosima Niehaus, a brilliant if whacked-out genius scientist; Helena, a crazed serial killer; and the scariest clone of them all, Rachel Duncan, the heartless executive who runs Dyad's Toronto offices.

As if Dyad weren't bad enough, we find out in the second-season opener that a group of religious fundamentalists has decreed that the women are less than human and deserve to be killed.

Orphan Black, like all great works of science fiction, provides us with an imaginative exploration of how scientific advances alter our world, how new tech raises moral questions and affects every facet of our social, political, and economic life.

Brilliantly written and photographed, it's as thrilling, exciting and groundbreaking as The X-Files was in its era.",1449014400,,2151,5.226744186046512
6220999,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This is a show that I've always wanted for so long but nothing was ever made of. I love the idea of clones in sci-fi films and tv shows and then this show happened. This season continued with where it left off last season but much better. The season carried on with many hilarious moments mainly between Alison and Donnie. I have to say this season won me over with their love because before I didn't trust him or like him at all AND wanted him gone.

I loved finding out a lot more on how the clones became who they are and what kind of things that went on with the process of cloning people.  Some secrets come out about why the clones are not able to have children and some other secrets come out about rachel which I found interesting. I do not care for here but I also feel for her as the season concluded. She's still a crazy chick!

Sarah is still my favorite but cosima is my close second as she seems more down-to-earth and relatable. I love her dorky side but I do not like her girlfriend daphne I believe her name is. She's not such a bad person but I'd rather cosima be single and focus on herself and finding this cure for this sickness.

The finale scene has me more than excited to start season 3. Sadly its not on prime at the moment so I have to buy each episode. Also, this show was renewed for a season four so there's MUCH more to come!",1448928000,,1356,4.125

A tour de force for an actress adept at playing different characters and using different accents to reflect the national origins. It's not perfect, but it's damned good.

6221210,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Unexpectedly intriguing...I turned this on one night, just for the heck of it, to see what it was like, starting with season 1.  I was surprised that I ended up liking it so much.  One girl plays about 10 different characters, and does so very believably!  She has different accents (all well done) and is amazing with her ability to morph into the various roles seamlessly...a few times, she even plays one of the clones impersonating a different clone, which takes some talent as well...her accents are good enough, that we looked her up online, to see if she was a Brit putting on a believable American accent, or vice versa...we found out that she's Canadian! So, her English accent is excellent, and she even does Russian and Ukranian and you wonder if she's from there because of how well she pulls it off.  I was most perturbed to find out that only the first two seasons are included with Amazon Prime.  They get you hooked into it, and then want to charge $2 an episode to get to see how season 3 plays out...totally poor on their part...season three should be included! I would have rated it 5 stars, if it wouldn't be for this issue.",1446508800,,1144,4.507246376811594

6221367,3,B00HUCF7AO,"Terrific storyline & performances, most especially by Tatiana Maslany. A genuine thriller of Bond-like proportions (since Daniel Craig become Bond). Characters are well-developed. On the downside, though Jordan Gavaris as Felix & Maslany as Cosima are 1st rate, enough of gay-ness. The storyline seeks to make a major statement about being gay. It does: It beats viewers about the head & shoulders with his gay lifestyle. It drives it into the ground.

Not everyone; indeed, not even close to everyone, is OK with the gay lifestyle. This viewer included. This is not the same thing as being against gays. This is viewer is not a gay hater/basher.

Orphan Black's storyline does not depend upon, doesn't even need Felix or Cosima, or any other character, to be gay. Their lifestyle is a non-essential plot element.

My rating would be 5 stars were it not for the producers trying to turn a minor element into a major indispensable in driving this otherwise brilliant drama forward.",1445472000,,980,5.0

6221405,4,B00HUCF7AO,"This is a dense & dark drama centered on the first creation of human clones, with one character portraying eight genetically identical people who have been living completely different lives - until they meet.

thinking them to be a weapon that could control our evolutionary future. Maslany (the lead) does a remarkable job of portraying eight human clones who are genetically identical, but who are living completely different lives - before they eventually meet.

Characters with a wide mix of sexual & gender preferences are richly done - I praise them not for their sexuality but for their several active roles in the drama.

With one actor playing eight roles, I struggled at times with tracking identities, others may not.

Despite that, I say stick with it; through three seasons a lot that was confusing in early episodes later becomes clear.

I'll footnote this: While just fiction (for now), the subtext of this drama raises questions we all may be facing within a few decades.",1444867200,,987,4.957575757575758

6221727,5,B00HUCF7AO,Phenomenal show. Tatiana Maslany is such a great actress that sometimes I forget that she is playing multiple characters when they are in a scene together. Pacing in the show is always on point. It has the occasional corny moment as most shows do but I love this show. Any scene with Alison is down right histerical.,1443139200,,316,4.56140350877193

Can't help but dig the work of Tatiana though...a huge amount of work into the various roles. A couple were a bit like she was impersonating  a version of herself but Alison, Cosima, Helena were great.  Just the formula of it all killed me. And the gimmicky partnerships were goofy almost like it was sniffing out spin-offs: And this week's odd couple is ""Fee & Alison""- let's follow them on their little adventure. I'd have liked a bit more of a bigger picture philosophy too though- what's it all about man- kinda like the novel 'Never Let Me Go' did. It was a bit too cosy too. When in fear of your life, go hang out in Fee's place of whose address that every good, bad and indifferent guy knows of. Helena is great though...really ended up shouting for her.",1443139200,3,860,4.541935483870968

6221826,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This is, Without a Doubt, The Most Mezmerizing Series I Have Ever Encountered. The Script, The Dialoug The Charectures, The Acting And Most Especially Tatiana Maslany! How She can Make you forget she's playing mutipal parts and endear each and every one to you, is a work of Art , but then some of the Credit goes behind the scenes,As Well, because each and every Actor is Equally Talented in their Roles, This is a Masterpiece and The Complete Series is in My Library , Forever as Proof.",1442361600,,488,4.556818181818182

6221852,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Good entertainment.  My wife is upset I want to wait for season 3 to be available on Prime. The story line is pretty fluid, and fortunately most plot tangents are closed off so each episode can continue the primary story.

The writing is good, the main character is extremely talented playing all the clones, in the beginning I though maybe she had a twin sister helping her with the roles but its one person playing each clone, it is pretty amazing how they do the show.  The guy who plays the brother is hilarious.  I still can't decide who is my favorite clone Kasima, Helena or Sara.",1442275200,,415,4.434210526315789

6221863,4,B00HUCF7AO,Interesting SciFi thriller from the BBC. For some reason it's set in the U.S. but it's very British. Darker & wilder than an American show.

The entire cast continues to serve serve up stellar performances, with Tatiana Manslany continuing to dazzle the viewer with her amazing performance in multiple roles.

6222183,5,B00HUCF7AO,"First of all, I'm obsessed with Orphan Black, so I would never give it less than 5 stars for any of the seasons. BUT...out of all three seasons thus far, season 2 is my least favorite. That's not to say I didn't like it a lot, I just didn't love it. There are some great highlights - including some really great Cophine moments, and some good back-story that you'll be lost in season 3 without.

You will not be disappointed if you watch it! Just remember that season 3 brings it all back around and it phenomenal!",1440979200,,514,4.298969072164948

The characters are very enjoyable, Allison, Rachel, and Felix are our favorites. We waited for this season to be on prime for free. We are not waiting for the third. We are buying a season pass.

6222331,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Intricate (but not overly complex) story lines, compelling characters (94% of which are played by one actor) and a thought-provoking premise make for the best show on television today.  The entire cast is extraordinary (particularly Maria Doyle-Kennedy as Mrs. S and the exquisite Evelyne Brochu as Delphine) with Jordan Gavaris giving an incredible, beautifully layered portrayal as Felix - Sarah's foster brother/confidant/partner in crime.

The standout, however, continues to be Tatiana Maslany.  In S2, she brings seven characters to life - not just, ""Oh, different hair and clothes means another Clone!""...I mean, a fully realised, fleshed-out person, with their own accent, vocal tone/register, gait and mannerisms. To say that she is in the midst of a tour de force performance is the biggest understatement ever uttered. I often find myself emotionally overwhelmed when watching her work!

6222424,4,B00HUCF7AO,"First and foremost, Tatiana Maslany continues to do brilliant work in the second season of Orphan Black.  How someone can convincingly play this many different characters and NOT wind up with an Emmy is...well, evidence that the Emmys continue to suck.  Whatever other issues the season may have, every episode is a must-watch simply to enjoy Maslany's multiple performances. In particular, the work she does as Helena, rounding out and humanizing the character, is phenomenal.

That being said, the plot for season 2 was more scattered than the first season's, and it didn't always seem like the show runners had a firm grasp on the big picture.  In many ways it feels like a bridge between season one and season three (which I've not seen because it isn't on Prime yet).",1439942400,,772,4.870229007633588

6222442,1,B00HUCF7AO,"I loved the first season, but I'm giving it one star because Amazon is selling series Two at a fair price ONLY to Amazon Prime customers!!! What the h!!!?  Is this a new policy overall, or only for this series?  This is a rip-off supreme, and all Amazon customers should refuse to buy this or any other DVD if they are forced to sign up for A. Prime in order to do it.  I've considered A.Prime and decided I don't want to sign up for it at this time.  Now, am I gong to be restricted from buying some products because I've made this pragmatic choice?  And why are the people who control the content, in this case of the wonderful Orphan Black, going along with this.  Soon, will all content providers be so cowed by Amazon Prime that they won't provide anything to us ""plebeians"" who wish to buy from Amazon as we have all along?  Will those of us who search the best deal from Amazon be permanent second class customers forced to buy any dregs that Amazon decides are not prime enough for Prime?

6222515,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching, and I wasn't sure I was going to stick with it after the first couple of episodes of Season 1. However, I'm glad I did because good things come to those who wait. It's like a pot of water on the stove. It needs to increase to a frenzied boil after some time, not right away. That's the payoff. The cast is impressive, but Maslany is amazing in the way she has given every clone her own voice, personality, and quirks. It's about time she got her Emmy nom and now hopefully a win, because she deserves it. My favorite scene was in Felix's flat with all the sisters, even Helena, dancing together. It was sweet, touching, and flawlessly filmed. I hope Prime will make Season 3 available soon, because I can't wait to find out what's going to happen next.

6222677,3,B00HUCF7AO,"This show is really funny. It is supposed to be sci-fi/crime-mystery, but watches more like a comedy with a little action/drama thrown in the mix. Despite it being entertaining, it seems to be written for a younger audience (teenagers to early 20-somethings?) and I find myself thinking it is a dark after-school program rather than something that an adult might tune in to watch. Perhaps that is just the normal quirkiness of sci-fi.",1438905600,,434,4.958904109589041

6222835,4,B00HUCF7AO,"This is an engrossing series with some excellent characters and spot-on acting.  I think it falls short of 5 stars because some episodes are sketchy  with story continuity and you can lose track of what's going on (even binge watching it) at times.  It may just be the British storytelling style, but I found it a little disconcerting.  Other than that, the other issue I had was that yes, human cloning is illegal, and yes, human clones are treated as animals by their governments (in this story), but I found myself not being able to work up the same frenzy over the ethics that the writers of this show seem to be in.  Muddying the waters is one character who is a clone, but in a high-ranking government position who theoretically would be in an excellent position to either promote the bright future of human clones, or to bring down the whole operation.  She seems to not be in either position, and it's difficult to track her motivations, which is a distraction to the show.  Stellar character performances by Tatiana Maslany, as she plays ALL the female clone parts extremely consistently, which is no small feat considering all the clone characters are digitally pasted in with one another requiring extensive use of green screen and doubles.  Good directing!  I like the overall production sheen of this show, and the use of single camera scenes judiciously and appropriately.  It kept me watching it for 3 nights of 2 seasons!",1438214400,,1437,4.758064516129032

6222942,5,B00HUCF7AO,"A sci-fi series without aliens or blasters or lots of CGI? Yes, just good speculative writing. The very talented lead actress plays 11 different roles with some remarkable green screen technology and en excellent supporting cast including the former Max Headroom, Matt Frewer who performed convincingly and characteristically as a good bad guy, or was he a bad good guy? The biotechnology involved is speculative but hardly outlandish and this is some of the most believable science fiction you will see.",1437523200,,504,5.234567901234568

The characters are so rich that you truly care about them and know them. Lead actress Tatiana maslany is amazing in that she plays multiple characters and never breaks from each individual she plays.
Season 2 is a great continuation. Some Questions do get answered but of course more nefarious events take place. This is a series I will re watch. You don't want to miss it!",1437436800,,534,4.691489361702128

That is just the beginning.  The storyline is serial in nature, like The Fugitive series long ago, but the mapping of Orphan Black's saga is fresh, often surprising and well written, leaving the viewer with a virtual narcosis Binge with a capital ""B"".

I have experienced an array of emotions with all the episodes. I have even had dreams about the show. I am eager to see Season 3 and want to see many more years of Orphan Black.

Of course she is one of a large number of clones of herself, so perhaps that shares the work out a little.  She is an actress of significant talent, so much so that the entire series is driven by her energy and skills.  The production is a sic-fi, UK/Canada collaboration, not quite at the production quality of Downton Abbey, and there are two or three very weak actors among the cast.  Well worth the time to watch.

6223213,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Five MYSTERIOUS Stars. ***UPDATE: she FINALLY WON THE EMMY IN A LATER SEASON AS BEST ACTRESS*** Tatiana Maslany continues her brilliant performance and even ups the ante, as does the rest of the cast. Season 2 introduces a number of surprises and characters that keep the tension going through to the end. If you liked the first season of Orphan Black, season two will bend your mind more than Season 1. The producers were brilliant in bringing back the towhead' and introducing new characters such as the Michelle Forbes (Ensign Ro of Star Trek TNG) character. They probably should have kept one of the characters, who came and went very quickly, but otherwise they are making brilliant choices that will keep the audience guessing and give even new revelations, leading to Season 3. There are also continuted great supporting performances by Jordan Gravis, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Dylan Bruce, Kevin Hanchard, Delphine Cormier, Skyler Wexler, and others. Highly Recommended with rating cautions noted below. Buckle up for some amazing scenes. Five MIND-BOGGLING Stars. (BBC. Amazon Instant Video. 10 episodes. Season 2.

That, of course would be too boring, and so you have an evil company who created multiple clones who were released into society without knowing the others existed. . . . . until they did. The remaining seasons are a continuation of whether the clones work under the creator's microscope or if there is a nefarious intent to use the clones and threaten their lives and those around them.

Wherever she is, whoever she is , you can't help but root for the ""Sestras"", except maybe Rachel.

6223353,4,B00HUCF7AO,"Tatiana makes this series worth watching.  Her amazing acting carries a somewhat weak storyline along.

It is not a series for children under 15 to watch without an adult, as the subject matter is mature and complicated, but there is nothing gratuitous in the violence or sexual situations. There is a great comedic aspect that offsets the sadness and drama. For acting buffs, this series is required viewing.",1436400000,,449,4.625

Tatiana Maslany has an uncanny ability to create incredibly unique personalities and ticks for her characters.  Sometimes I'm stunned to find out the current actor on screen is actually Tatiana Maslany.  As much as I LOVE Tatiana Maslany, I am equally taken with Jordan Gavaris' acting abilities as well; maybe even more so.  He is hillarious and works his character perfectly in unique and interesting ways!",1435363200,,536,5.247058823529412

I enjoyed the bit of comedic storyline that Allison's character brought to this season. I did not care for the main plotline that seemed to drag on. I only looked forward to seeing Allison and Helena's stories. Not as good as the first season which kept me hooked from episode to episode.

6223991,4,B00HUCF7AO,"A story about human clones in their twenties that are all in very different life situations (punk, soccer mom, corporate VP, violent religious extremist, bio-tech nerd, police offer). When they find out about each other (and some evil plot to kill them all), these extremely different characters (all played by the same actress) start interacting (and sometimes filling in for each other), which makes for amazing and surprising story lines.

I love how it cuts through all the genres, SciFi, thriller, detective story, desperate house wives, hilarious black comedy. Very well done.

What I don't like is that Seasons 1 and 2 were free on Prime, getting me hooked, while Season 3 is only available for purchase (not renting) and rather expensive...",1435276800,,748,5.122950819672131

6223994,4,B00HUCF7AO,"There is no way anyone I mean anyone, would try and get away with impersonating a police officer and detective no less and get away with it.  The beginning could have been made to the more realistic. You just had to ignore what was happening and with zero explanation of how she coped with day to day activities at the station not having one ounce of knowledge made for repeated eye rolls.  But once this foolishness passes the show did become quite good.  The second season had many new developments that carried the show until the last episode and the unveiling of male clones.  But as many other reviewers have already stated it is so confusing as to what exactly is going on and who is on who's side. Of course the writers want you to keep guessing but to this point the only person I am pulling for and who i think will be on Tatiana's side is Paul. Because of all this confusion of what's happening I have not yet decided to watch the third season.  I certainly will not pay to watch it.  On a side note the acting by the star is outstanding (although i do not like the male they made her portray, the last clone).",1435276800,,1120,4.2843601895734595

6224040,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Currently my new TV obsession. I usually HATE shows where an actress/actor plays several characters but this is done SO well that the characters are all their own unique individuals...you totally forget it is the same actress (except they look alike, which, is the point of the whole show).

6224041,5,B00HUCF7AO,"It was hard to imagine that this show could continue apace in its second season, but it did! The plot continues to evolve (or perhaps ""spontaneously erupt"" would be better).

6224043,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This TV series is one of the world's best kept entertainment secrets and it really shouldn't be a secret.  The chemistry between characters, even the highly varied characters played by the same actors, is outstanding.  The script appears to move fluidly toward a prearranged, long-term destination that isn't irrationally rerouted at the whim of the writers like many U.S.-based shows that don't appear to be thought out more than one season in advance (e.g. Lost).  Though this is a serial, it thoughtfully concludes certain story lines while injecting future story line possibilities in a way that will keep the audience looking forward to more episodes without leaving the audience hanging from a cliff while waiting for a new season to begin (that often either never begins or has to be drastically rerouted due to unexpected casting changes).",1435104000,,847,5.1678832116788325

She is a true treasure and ably assisted by the entire crew. Story line should awaken many, to the challenging issues, in our 'New Brave World"" while remaining entertaining & true, to the best tradition of sci fi.

6224165,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I love the uniqueness of this show with great characters. Just when you think you've got the basis of the plot down, a new variable or person enters. The development of the different personalities is so layered that you go from fearing or despising characters to finding them endearing and loving.
The science isn't too deep or elaborate to distract from the plot. but it certainly provides the basis of the originality and storyline.

This is a great show for guys and girls alike. It's definitely full of cliffhangers but not as brutally violent as most of the other shows that I binge watch with my fance.",1434412800,,608,4.682242990654205

6224254,5,B00HUCF7AO,This is one of the most intriguing shows we have watched for a long time.  The Tatiana Maslany (the main actress) plays many different women and she is absolutely believable as each character.  How they have them all in one room together is totally beyond me.  I love this show and all the twist and turns.  Her brother Phee is fabulous.  This is a must watch.,1434412800,,360,4.393939393939394
6224255,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This show is great. Tatiana Maslany is almost definitely the best actress I've ever seen. I often forget that it's actually the same actress playing so many different roles, and then every time I remember, it just blows my mind. The rest of the cast is also really good, including the child actor who plays Kira. I'm used to being disappointed by child actors, but this girl is good. I love the plot and the character development. The only complaint I have is that sometimes when two or more clone characters are in the same frame, it looks kinda fake and weird, and sometimes when their hands interact it doesn't look right, but I understand how difficult it must be to film those kind of scenes. It happens pretty rarely though, and it's not too obvious or horrible, so it doesn't bother me that much. Overall, SUPER great show.",1434412800,,830,4.577181208053691

6224311,5,B00HUCF7AO,"The premise is ""Orphan Black"" has only learned recently that she is a clone and that there are others like her.  And since the main characters are primarily the clones, only one actress can be used to play the different roles. Tatiana Maslany, who plays the protagonist(s) does an amazing job of portraying different characters without creating stereotypes. Each clone is unique and believable as a full human being. It's impressive she is able to change personas so quickly and completely (I'm assuming each show was shot in sequence).  I would definitely recommend  this for those who are interested in the SciFi/adventure/thriller genre.",1434067200,,640,5.194174757281553

There is just enough suspense to keep me coming back for the next episode. As a sci-fi show it does lack a tad in the science behind human cloning, but the well defined characters make up for that slight defect. I believe the hidden gem is the character, Felix, played by Jordan Gavaris, as the foster brother of the main character, Sarah. His performance is brilliant and flawless.",1433721600,,516,4.875

There are a ton of indicate plot elements.  It would be difficult to pick up season 2 and get the full measure of the series.  Watch season 1 first.
Watching this will reward you with fairly non-insulting science, engaging characters, and a plot that has not seen the shark I am sure it will eventually need to jump.  I will be disappointed when this show finally jumps the shark as it is a keeper.

You don't see any of them reading the teleprompter as they are giving their lines (as you do with some low budget shows). The actors actually make their roles believable. Only wish that the writers would create stories that were not as corny as these ones are. If it wasn't for that I would have given it a full 5 stars.,1433721600,,412,4.227848101265823

6224540,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Just as good as the first season, largely due to Tatiana Maslany's fantastic skill, as noted so many other reviewers, that it's pointless to even mention it again.  It's amazing how you can love some of the characters she's portraying (like Cosima) and hate others (like Rachel) --- or even both at once (like Helena), or change your opinion about them over time (like Alison) --- and recognize which is which at a glance.  Or have a scene in which she's playing five separate characters (unless I've lost count; maybe four is the max) mutually interacting with each other.  Of course I'm sure that makeup and costuming and just plain camera tricks help out a lot in ways I can't understand, but however they do it, it's seamless and perfect.  It's not *just* Tatiana Maslany, of course, though I doubt the show is even possible without her; the entire cast is quite good, even the characters I hate, and the story is reasonably entertaining, even if not differing tremendously in its basic idea from similar shows like Dark Angel.",1433721600,,1031,4.743016759776537

The twists and turns just keep on coming and you never know who is good and who is bad, sometimes from one scene to the next. Tatiana Maslany portrays the characters all so differently, I rarely glimpse one inside the other. I mean, really, you would actually think there are a whole batch of them most of the time! About to start Season 3 which I understand is still airing on ""regular"" TV. I already feel depressed that I will not only not be able to binge watch this masterpiece, but I'll have to wait each week at a certain point... and then... gulp... I'll have to wait for Season 4.

6224623,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Just started watching as art of my Amazon Prime trial, and I'm totally hooked.  There aren't really many new plots or storylines out there these days, so the things that make it worthwhile are the acting and the writing.  Tatiana Maslany has to be having a blast playing all of those clones, and Jordan Gavaris does a fantastic job as Felix.  Dylan Bruce is easy on the eyes as well.  I'm not easily entertained, but I feel this is a good way to spend some of my free time.",1433203200,,473,4.280898876404494

If you haven't seen Orphan Black, you should give it an honest try and watch a few episodes. The show is a good blend of drama, suspense, and dark humor. Full of sinister conspiracy with sci-fi elements, the writing in this show does not disappoint! The acting is also superb with solid and quality performances by the cast and Tatiana Maslany (the lead) simply shines. Tatiana not only does one role very well, she nails nine of them! To steal a description of Orphan Black I've seen from several professional critics: ""Orphan Black is absolutely the best show on TV that you aren't watching"".",1433030400,,737,4.803149606299213

The acting and directing is amazing when you realize that Tatiana plays most of the roles in the show. THe main character/characters are searching for their purpose while overcoming their challengers.

 It is a british show, so the sexuality is a bit more relaxed than in the US.  But the thought level is higher as well, giving a great though provoking series.",1432944000,,513,4.644444444444445

The premise didn't seem strong enough, but it lasted into its second season and I thought somewhere along the way it would flounder, start being boring and/or predictable. However the writers have managed to continue adding enough twists and characters to the show to keep it going into its third and apparently there will be a fourth season. I loved every minute of this and am now debating whether to pay for season 3 or to wait till it becomes available on Prime.",1432944000,,560,4.61
6224782,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Tatiana is amazing, the cast is great.  It has Science Fiction elements that I have always loved with enough other story lines to keep my wife happy, and some are quite funny and would fit right in a episode of Weeds or Breaking Bad.",1432944000,,233,4.295454545454546

6224793,5,B00HUCF7AO,It's really too bad that only five stars are available for one of the best shows on TV.  Tatiana Maslany continues to show why she's regarded as one of the best young actors anywhere.  Watching her switch so seamlessly from one clone's character to another reminds me of Meryl Streep's versatility.

I continue to be amazed by the seamlessness of all the orphans together in the same room or interacting with each other and blown away by the skill of Tatiana Maslany to give each orphan a distinct personality and style despite being played by the same actress.

Got through the whole season in a day and a half and am eagerly awaiting season 3 to come to Prime!",1431993600,,428,4.417721518987341

6225037,5,B00HUCF7AO,Great series. Season 2 is every bit as good as Season 1 in my opinion.  I am constantly amazed at the tremendous acting of the female lead.  I truly forget it is the same actress each time she appears as a different clone.  It was well worth the cost of the season.  I am happy that Season 3 has just started airing.  Unique show.  Great acting.  Just plain fun.,1431993600,,362,4.159420289855072
6225048,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I skipped over watching this show for too long.  A friend told me she was sure I would like it and if I just took the time to watch the first episode of season 1 I would be hooked.  She was right!

I binged on Seasons 1 & 2 over Mother's Day weekend and am current on Season 3.  The action is intense, the story line intriguing and Tatiana Maslany's talent is worth watching in and of itself...She is fabulous!  Surrounding Tatiana is a well rounded and diverse supporting cast as well.  Each character is developed with depth and personality.  Yes, even the brotherhood of clones have diverse, interesting characteristics.  At this point I must also give a huge shout out to Jordan Gavaris, who plays Felix Dawkins, as a masterful scene-thief.

If you were like me and have been putting off plunging into this series, make the time and get hooked.  This is definitely on my 'favorite series' list!",1431993600,,898,4.55625

6225061,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This wonderful sci-fi series continues to impress with its second season. Star Tatiana Maslany plays so many roles so well she's like a one-woman carnival. The season follows immediately the cliff-hanger closer of Season 1, where Sarah came to her mum's house to find both Mrs. S and Kira missing. In an effort to stay spoiler-free, I'll only say that for every question Sarah answers, three more spring up. The writers do a great job of stringing us along, never revealing too much but continuing to keep it interesting. While it should go without saying, this wonderful series is particularly convoluted and hard enough to follow when you're paying attention. If you're reading this and you haven't seen Season 1, go there first.",1431993600,,731,4.951219512195122

6225073,4,B00HUCF7AO,"I tripped on season one of Orphan black while deployed in Afghanistan and basically binged through it.  The first season I thought was great due to Taiana Maslany, but the sci-fi/suspense/thriller/conspiracy/military cocktail is entertaining great as well.  I think special affects and action sequences are fun to watch like the next person, but a interesting storyline is needed also.  I think with sci-fi/fantasy stories, the ""buy in"" to the story and the ""special effects"" don't match, it can either be entertaining or eye-rolling depending on your taste.  I think that is what make the orphan black series relatively unique.  It has the sci-fi storyline of cloning mix in with the ngovernment/military conspiracy without the huge need of special effects.  True there are parts in Orphan Black of the ""buy in"" can be a reach, but that is with any sci-fi fantasy story and the creators and writers have done a great job.

As for Season Two you won't be disappointed.  If you enjoyed S1 you will like S2.  S1 provided the foundation of the story line along with the various characters/ clones.  S2 I think provides more depth to the various character clones which I think the series has done well without being too serious.  Tatian Maslany is a great talent not only for her looks, but here ability to make all her characters/clones/sisters unique.  Season 2 gave a great cliffhanger at the end have me debate either buying S3 or waiting until in becomes free on Amazon Prime!",1431993600,,1477,4.887550200803213

I can only assign her failure to win the really big Best Actress awards to the off-center nature of the series' plot lines.  She is a wonder & I will watch every future episode of Orphan Black in order to watch her skills & whatever roles she plays after Orphan Black will be on my ""must see"" list.

I won't name the unforgivably bad one to avoid spoiling a twist, but it's pretty bad.  Often, the story gets downright silly, but it's a comic book style action/sci-fi story, so if you don't expect great literature or great film, you'll probably enjoy it if you like a little bit of brainless melodrama.  Enough mystery and surprise cancel out the obvious and expected that inevitably come with this type of pulp plotting.",1431734400,,579,4.538461538461538

6225218,4,B00HUCF7AO,"I was asked to rate seasons 1 & 2 separately, I did not know how to do that; is 1 better than 2?  I couldn't see the whole broken into two subsets, one compliments the other, the only difference is time, one follows the other; there were no significant changes that set them into two separate genres. I waited to watch all that was available and then formulated one general analysis and critique of the series.

It is, indeed very good, one of the best, I enjoyed it immensely. A new formula with a very talented female performer who is still developing in the art of drama and perhaps, one of these days, become as accomplished as Meryl Streep, I'd like that very much. Her talent is uncanny as she represents these identical clones not alike in character, personality or nature within; when she acts one forgets the other even if two or more are present in the same scene, I was partaken. My favorite character is Helena, a ruthless killer with hidden sensitivity and a heart of gold, her shortcomings are the result of a cruel and misguided upbringing, but down deep she knows the difference between good and evil. La Femme Nikita and Colombiana have nothing on her, they don't even hold a candle to Helena; she's also a survivor of the toughest kind. I hope nothing happens to her, in the last installment of Season 2, she gets abducted by the military and taken into a Hercules transport airplane  to be flown somewhere.

The series could've been first rate, but it is not, to my taste. Some writers, producers and directors can't seem to get the message that if the viewer wants to watch pornography he/she would watch a XXX movie. The explicit sex is totally unnecessary here and even disgusting as in any other production, in fact the best movies have hardly any torrid scenes in them. Euripides, Shakespeare, Moliere and others of the great ones, never seem to have run to this tool to make their plays likeable. I guess filth sells, but not as well as clean art and talent.
For this reason I gave Orphan Black four stars, a great production heavily influenced by the new progressive forces of cinematography.",1431648000,,2118,4.610079575596817

I would like the series to have an end at some point and have the story line work to it. It's too good to let dangle in purgatory.",1431129600,,534,4.515463917525773

I have outgrown violence and crime dramas ... 'till this one got me hooked! This is a good suspense watch that will keep your interest.

It took a few episodes to grow on me, but then I got past the blood and guts of the story line, and realized what a great acting talent I was witnessing in the ability of this fine actress to assume all of these characters in so many diverse roles in one continuous plot. Heck, I'm even enjoying the supporting actors, directing, and story telling by now too. :)

I'll never know if this was a good story, production, or cast of characters on its own from now on because ...
Tatiana Maslany is a gem of an actress to pull all of this off and together at the same time!",1430784000,,795,4.183006535947713

This season, as you get accustumed to the world it takes place in (ours, except for one detail), you grow close to the characters and begin to follow Sarah's reasons for what she does. All of the actors are amazing, but if you know anything about the show, you know Tatiana Maslany is a god in acting. I really don't want to spoil anything for someone who hasn't watched the show, but it's great. Realistic Sci-Fi with amazing actors and characters you really care about.

This is a compelling work of science fiction to explore the idea of human cloning; social statements made by the series are, IMO, completely superfluous and gratuitous. I'm just sick of it. If not for this ruination of a fascinating series, I would give it 5 stars for the incredible overlooked talent of Tatiana Maslany. This actor's talent just blows my mind! Season 1 was better, in my opinion. Get off your high gay horses, folks. We get the issue without you continually using vehicles like Orphan Black in an attempt to force your POV down our throats! I will not watch season 3 (if there is one), and that is a shame.",1430524800,,740,4.7890625

To sum it, maybe 3 episodes worth of writing taffied into 10 episodes, likely by some Hollywood auto writing program.

Great actors, s***e story. sad =(

This season features a s***ty and pathetic cliche addition of:

1) Church vs science, watering down the very real science vs individual rights of Season 1, pretty much making Season 2 a reboot of the series. (I image a meeting somewhere went something like this ""Wow, season 1 was a hit! How can we make season 2 have real mass market appeal? Bring out the Hollywood book of tropes!"")
2) A Bounty hunter.
3) A Rouge cop.
4) Jaded Rouge cops partner.
5) Apparently mythology as well.

Episode 4 really killed me with the:
1) Hey let's have them rob this store 1/2 a mile from their hiding destination so the bounty hunter can find them.
2) There are miles of farm land but magically the bounty hunter picks the right house right when the girl is alone, because after running and fighting the whole 1 season and being on the run for the second season I'll just let my daughter roam around without watching here.
3) I got a sniper rifle, but I won't take the shot because I might miss.
4) I'm sure the bad guy is dead, I'm not going to bother putting a bullet in his head with this gun I found, so he can wake up later with tense surprise music!
5) Oh no, we got betrayed by these people we were close to, that we still trusted even though we just found out I'm a clone!

To sum it, maybe 3 episodes worth of writing taffied into 10 episodes, likely by some Hollywood auto writing program.

6226414,5,B00HUCF7AO,The show is great...but once again Amazon prime gives you the 1st 2 seasons and then gets you hooked and wants you to pay for the 3rd season. I hate that. I say give it all or none! Netflix never does this practice.,1430352000,,215,4.023255813953488

6226442,5,B00HUCF7AO,"Maybe not quite as exciting or splendidly chaotic as Season 1, but Season 2 still proves that this show is better than most SF, or even dramas in general, on TV. The plot is getting more and more complex without feeling the least bit jumbled, and the writers continue to find new twists and turns to keep intrigue high. Not to mention Tatiana Maslany's beautiful performance is even more spectacular this time around.

One of the things I really love about Orphan Black is the way it explores gender, sexuality and identity issues--and of course the old nature vs. nurture argument. Season 2 does a nicer job of this with perhaps more nuance and intellect than Season 1 did. This, for me, is why this show is one of my favorites on TV right now, and one of the best SF series in a long time.",1430352000,,791,4.417808219178082

What I do like, is how Tatiana Maslany changes for each character. I now watch for the differences in each character she plays. While she's not prefect playing the large number of clone copies, she does not make to many mistakes as you really believe she is another person.",1430352000,,462,4.25

An acting tour de force by Tatiana Maslany, who was surprisingly jilted by the Emmy's.  The last time such a tour de force was seen, was in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" with Alec Guiness playing seven male roles and one female and that movie was made in 1949.",1430352000,,387,4.333333333333333

I am so impressed by her ability to play different characters with different accents, mannerisms, and facial expressions!  Another reason to love the show?  Science!  This show is about what Science is opening up to us and , not to mention, what may be possible issues in the not too distant future!  And, science is not just about genetics and DNA and cloning but it is also artfully brought down to the level of a child albeit the child is a brilliant little actress herself!  And another reason to love this show?  You just start to believe that you know who is playing on what side and the tables turn.  Every episode you'll need to decide if you want to be on the side of the little bit ""bad"" or the little bit ""good"".  Enjoy!",1430265600,,846,4.365384615384615

The premise behind this series would never work without someone who can do what she does, bringing life to multiple characters who are the same, but different.

6226895,5,B00HUCF7AO,"I'm normally not a science fiction fan but I was captivated by the first two seasons of Orphan Black. The story line is unique and interesting, and far fetched but not so far fetched that I found myself thinking ""this is stupid"". It's about cloning and let's face it; there are far more far fetched topics than that (e.g., zombies) or some other completely unbelievable premise. The series get's nearly five star reviews across the board and it's well-deserved.

I'm an Amazon Prime member so I was able to watch the first two seasons for free and am currently recording the third season on my DVR. As much as I liked it I don't think it's worth buying the season(s).",1430265600,,667,4.558333333333334

6226917,4,B00HUCF7AO,"I really appreciate Tatiana Maslany's acting in these various roles (Helena is a real jewel in her portrayal).  I don't care for some of the background - it's a bit raunchy for my taste.  The storyline is a little hard for me to follow, but I do gather that there are several factions involved: a biolab doing experiments with cloning, a religious cult run by a megalomaniac, a military faction, the police and something else I don't follow.  And of course, the clones themselves who are trying to stay alive and free in spite of the other forces at work either to use them or to eliminate them.",1430265600,,595,4.4907407407407405

The story can be complicated and if you aren't familiar with it, you'll be lost. I liked the turn the plot took this season, exploring the religious aspect (although to be fair, it is a fringe religion).

This season seemed a bit more hardcore in the violence area.

Is it reminiscent of the cylon dilemma? Perhaps.

Fast paced and carried me along episode to episode. I think I watched it all in one night, until 3 a.m. And I'm a b- if I don't get my 8 hours, and I work at 7:30 in the morning. So I was willing to go without sleep just to find out more. Each episode made me go: What's that mean? Who's that? What's that?

Thank you Amazon for the foresight to take this series up and to offer season 1 and 2 for free.",1430006400,,678,4.113636363636363

6227379,5,B00HUCF7AO,"My husband watched season 1 a while back. I wasn't interested. He persuaded me to watch a few episodes of the first season just to see if I might like it so I did ... reluctantly. This kind of thing isn't usually my ""thing"". I couldn't stop watching it! Now on season 2 I am appreciating it even more. The acting is outstanding, especially Tatiana Maslany who I keep forgetting is just one person. She needs an Emmy! I really like the dark humor that goes along with the very intense drama. We are almost done with 2 and are DVRing 3 so we'll be able to move right into it. With the end of The Americans and Broadchurch and the soon demise of Mad Men, this is my saving grace over most of the dreck that is currently on TV. It is worth a watch even if you don't usually like this genre.",1430006400,,786,4.1103896103896105

6227862,3,B00HUCF7AO,"Season one was far more compelling. Season two felt like a lot of repetitive and gimmicky chasing around. Reminded me of the various fetch missions on MMORPGs. I also hate the plot mechanism where people are killed off in various ways only to be ridiculously resuscitated later. Also, the obsession with the child was okay up to a point, but was not believable by the end of the season. Lastly, the Allison storyline got super old and while clearly intended to provide some comic relief, felt rather out of place. In general, story and character development definitely needed some work in this season. I like the premise, though, and definitely enjoyed the first season.",1429660800,,670,4.885964912280702

I haven't finished season 2 - taking my time to relish it - but it is an excellent series that is intriguing to watch because of one person being on screen playing so many parts and how well that is done.

6228073,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This has got to be one of the best shows I've ever watched and they definitely kept it up for season 2. Tatiana Maslany is an impressive actress. It is always amazing to me when one actress can play such different roles/characters and having you believing each is separate and there are not many actresses that can do it. Usually, I see them on the screen and I'll say - oh, that's so-and-so from ___ and remember her role in that. In Orphan Black, Maslany does such a great job that even when you have multiple clones together, you still can see the differences. The differences are there not only with their accents, but with their diction, and their body language. As far as the storyline, it's got lots of variation to appeal to anyone.",1429574400,,740,4.488888888888889

If you haven't seen season one, go watch it before even thinking of watching season two.

Of course something came up just as I was getting interested and when I finally had time to watch again the deal was off.  So logically I joined Amazon Prime so I wouldn't have to buy 3 seasons of Orphan Black.

WONDERFUL show and it got me hooked within the first couple of episodes.  I will concede that I didn't like the title and that was what kept me away from it at first.  I've always wondered what would happen when clones were introduced into the world population ... now I can see that problems could arise.

6228327,4,B00HUCF7AO,"When it comes to entertainment, you tend to know why you like something; it's funny, or poignant, well-written, acted or directed, or a combination of all. Orphan Black is a little harder to figure because it has a way of being occasionally deficient in all relevant categories. It can be laugh-out-loud funny at times (watching housewife Allison trying to deal with something outside of her comfort zone). It can be poignant (recognizing Helena's essential need for family/connection). It's generally well-written (albeit, occasionally confusing). Tatiana Maslany is brilliant in most of her clone characters (Tony's something of a bust). The production qualities are high. Directed by different people, it can suffer from varyingly successful degrees of pace, focus, and the occasional odd moment. Yet for all of this, it is remarkably compelling. . .I read about the production in a recent New York Times Magazine article that focused on Tatiana Maslany, which led me to search out the series' first two seasons in time to watch its third season premiere on Saturday, April 18. I am frankly surprised that it has gone on so long (currently, 22 hours; with commercials) on BBC America without actually revealing the core motive behind the creation of its eight (nine? more?) central characters, all played by Maslany. It's a combination of excellent story-telling, and the occasionally manipulative technique of cliff-hangers that have kept me coming back. Just when I thought, at a variety of moments, that I'd had just about enough of the convoluted and long-drawn-out plot, the writers came up with something that in some cases, made me literally gasp. . ""Oh My God. . .!!"" It'll be interesting to see if this kind of pace can be sustained throughout its current season. And, inquiring minds want to know, will there ever be a satisfactory resolution; a finish to the tale that will resonate positively with its viewers. It feels like a story that requires an endgame; a point at which Sarah and her 'sisters' are no longer in danger and life goes on. It's not episodic in the way (as random example) that CSI adventures are episodic; different tales centered on a core concept and different cities. To be sure, there are interpersonal back stories to all of the CSI characters in their different cities and it helps to know who's who and their relationship to other series characters, but this doesn't affect the central story of each episode. So far, Orphan Black has been successful in creating something of an onion peel, where increasing layers of information inform the compulsion to keep watching. I suspect this is going to get old pretty soon. How many times can the tale re-wrap itself around some sort of immediate danger to Sarah's daughter, Kira, and the sisters' reaction which cause one or a combination of them to save the day and rescue the grade-school kid. We've been informed by some of the bad guys that Kira is something of a key to their whole scheme (which we still do not know in complete detail). Again, all well and good, but the series has the potential of becoming victim to its own layered complexities. Imagine discovering that Tolstoy had written War and Peace Part II. For all of its sequels and prequels, the Star Wars phenomenon has succeeded because each episode is complete in and unto itself. Yes, it is beneficial to the franchise that viewers come to succeeding productions, armed with some knowledge of the back stories, but you can sit down and watch Return of the Jedi and have a good time without resorting to the original and The Empire Strikes Back. This is not true of Orphan Black. Watching the Season Three opener would expose you to incomprehensible story lines that would frustrate your viewing pleasure.
All this said, if you have interest in this series, go back and start at the beginning.",1429401600,,3848,4.921538461538462

6228406,5,B00HUCF7AO,"There is nothing you can compare this intriguing,suspenful,surprising sci fi drama to.  It hooks you from the very 1st scene and never lets go.  After two full seasons I have yet to meet the person who began and then left the series.  It is so compelling and so wonderfully executed that you instantly become a fan.

A young woman witnesses a terrible suicide on a train platform.  Just as the woman walks to the edge of the platform she sees that she is her exact double!  Thus begins one of the wildest,surprising and tense journeys she and the viewer will ever take.  Just when you're certain you have an idea of what is going on,the tables turn,a new person is developed or a twist so compelling your neighbors here your gasp takes place.

More than all that and it's a lot,the lead T Maslany,is so good that it is still for me after two full seasons amazing to watch her.  She plays multiple characters with such grace and authenticity that you would swear they are all differant people.  And they are ,very much all differant characters.  The supporting cast,also is tremendous and the special effects perfect.  It is mezmorizing what they do.  The talent and patience it takes to film this series is amazing.  BRAVO is the only word that comes to mind to describe it!  And to give anything away would be wrong.  The next moment you have the time start this series.  Join the rest of us who can't stop expounding on our great find!!!

.  You don't have to be into sci fi to enjoy it.  You'll forget that it's that genre anyway.  It all very real!",1429401600,,1552,4.4714285714285715

The  other actors also are natural and believable. The writers manage to keep the story and the characters moving and interesting. While the premises of the story are not too plausible, it doesn't feel that way.  There is a fair amount of violence and a variety of forms of sexuality, but for the most part, it is character development rather than spectacle (well, some spectacle!).",1429401600,,521,4.842696629213483

It is one of the best shows out right now and in my top 10 for favorite TV shows. Both seasons are amazing and keep you guessing. I would definitely suggest this show to friends and family.

Going from one clone's big scene to another clone's big scene happens more frequently in Season 2, and truly feels like switching between actresses, making Tatiana Maslany's achievement all the more dazzling.

It is astounding how she is able to portray so many different characters and yet has the ability to make you fall in love with each one.

The storyline continues to amaze and evolve, with only a few glitches, becoming a fully developed character in its own right.

Perhaps the most amazing incarnation is Rachel, with her tiny body profile and skinny legs.  All of the other incarnations are also profound.  Perhaps the extremes are Helena and Allison; one being a homicidal maniac, and the other being a 'functional alcoholic' and soccer mom.  All of the other clone incarnations are equally amazing.  To say that this will be a 'cult classic' underrates its quality.  It will endure forever as something to be watched for many years to come.",1429142400,,609,5.04

The storyline is sci-fi, techi, and has humorous undertones with some overly acting whiffs from Sara's brother. There are strong actors supporting the story, and the pace of the writing and editing is really a well paced series that links you in.

The quick intro few minutes from past episode and linked to the few minutes of the few minutes from new episode is a great way to setup the story is very welcoming and I think original to me.

Its interesting enough to stay up a couple extra hours to finish the next episode.

6228612,5,B00HUCF7AO,"This show is RIDICULOUS! Once you start watching, you just can't stop. The lead actress is BRILLIANT!!! She has created 5-7 separate and distinct characters (they are all clones, but couldn't be more different from each other) that each has their own compelling storyline. It's stunning that she hasn't been nominated for an Emmy. She should be nominated in the lead actress AND supporting actress categories and should WIN in both. No one else even comes close to matching her work in this series. How is it that there isn't more buzz around this show and this actress in particular? For my money, she's the new 'it' girl(s)!",1428969600,,626,4.805555555555555

8635900,4,B00HUCF7AO,"I just finished the last season and it was very entertaining watching Tatiana play all of the clone sisters though some were much better than others you're never seeing one long enough thats its a problem. The plot is about clones, competing forces, issues and the ever present family and/or domestic crisis. A very good supporting cast keeps it together and if theres a fault it would be the humor is not always present but when it is its a real boost to the show. The last season seemed rushed, over the top and pretty devoid of humor. Its a good sci-fi thriller and through the course of the show it was sometimes hard to tell the same person was playing all the roles because the transformations were so good. Overall, it was a 4-star series but the last one is a real push to give it 3-stars. There are a few characters that I found to be annoying and there was much too much of them toward the end. If nothing else, it was worth it just for the uniqueness of the plot and how well it was done by Tatiana. It took us four years to see the entire series so Im copping out with the same review for each because my mind is too blurry to address each one specifically and if you like the first one you will watch the others despite what anyone has to say about it.",1527465600,,1265,4.209876543209877
