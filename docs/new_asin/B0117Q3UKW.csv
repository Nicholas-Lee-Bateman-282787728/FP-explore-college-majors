7328893,5,B0117Q3UKW,"I hadn't seen any episodes on Fox before buying this.  I bought it based on the reviews here and the overall concept of the show.  I binge watched the whole season over the course of a few days.  Overall very funny.  Will Forte's voice kind of gets on my nerves a bit.  I can't tell if that's the character he plays or just him.

The episodes are one continuous storyline so they need to be watched in order.  I'm hoping to catch the reruns of season 2 in order on TV, but if not, I'll have to wait for season 2 to come out on DVD to continue watching.  Being a pretty funny non-animated comedy on Fox, I expect it to be cancelled at any moment.",1451952000,6,645,4.063492063492063

7328898,4,B0117Q3UKW,"Is this a genius show? Maybe not. Is it entertaining? I thought so. A lot of folks are going to tell you that Forte's character turns into a jackass and it offended them, but I will point out that this is fiction, and the arc of the story is such that if he didn't behave the way he does there wouldn't be much else going on. I mean, I personally don't see the point of getting offended by someone who is ACTING. And speaking of acting: Kristen Schaal is a gem and everything she does is golden. This holds true for TLMOE.

Personally, I enjoy that the premise of this program is not just another annoying (insert nationality/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/era) family or workplace situation comedy, and actually has some creativity and potential for new, unexplored situations. I'm a fan of Will Forte, so I'm not going to say that I wasn't biased towards liking this in the beginning, but I do feel as if I had to defend the show because it definitely left me wanting to know what would happen in Season 2. I would even hazard that Forte's performance as Phil Miller is smarter and more nuanced than you may think. While I won't give it the five stars I would reserve for something in which I've become emotionally invested, I sure think it was entertaining enough for me.",1444089600,8,1274,4.539130434782609
7328899,3,B0117Q3UKW,"Definitely for adults though and not kids.
Phil, the main guy is funny but also has a lot of off-putting habits. Alone on earth, I suppose we all might pick up bad habits along the way. He surely does. Then a woman comes along, just like he asked for. Only she is nuts. With a capital N too. Carol is the barrel of laughs you look for in the show though. Then January Jones comes along and the story picks up pace, and the laughs continue.
Such an original concept for a show, and yet, not so far-fetched. Disaster could strike and wipe everyone, or almost everyone, out. I like that this show is a comedic approach to that what if. I think a lot of people will get a kick out of it, between the originality, the comedy and the cool cast members. I can't wait for season 2 now!

7328925,5,B0117Q3UKW,"This show is hilarious and very original!.  I didn't give it a chance when it first aired.  I only watched the first 10 or 15 minutes and switched channels because watching a guy talking to himself (cause he's the last man on Earth) and destroy things didn't seem that funny to me.  But after seeing all the great reviews and a super great price on the DVD set, I decided to give it another try.  I'm really glad I did because this show is very funny and Will Forte and all the other casts are great.  It's hilarious watching Will's character make plans and have something always go wrong.  The story is really good too since you always want to watch the next episode to see what happens next.  It's almost like one big movie that broken up into 30 minute bits.  This is one of the best shows on TV.  I can't wait for Season 2 to be available.  And the way they display the title ""Last Man on Earth"" on the screen at the beginning of every show kind of reminds me of the game Fallout when you encounter a new location.",1473984000,,1018,4.201030927835052

8723730,3,B0117Q3UKW,"Warning, some minor spoilers...

The first 3 episodes are brilliant.  The problem is, the rest of the season goes down hill after those amazing opening episodes.

The reason for the decline is the main character Phil Miller (played by Will Forte).  In the opening episodes Phil's what you might call an overgrown FRAT BOY--immature, sarcastic, an a-hole, but funny, wanton, wild, confident, and his own man who does manly things.  For instance, if he needs to get through a glass door, he just pulls out a .45 pistol and blows apart the glass.  For fun, he destroys things with a flame thrower or steam roller.  Funny, stupid and crazy stuff, but you like him for it and respect him for being his own man.  BUT then starting in the 4th episode, Phil COMPLETELY changes (due to the intro of a new character) and he totally becomes another person entirely--a pathetic, whiny little d-bag with no confidence and no manliness at all.  He's annoying and weak and you have no respect for him.  During the scene were he was ""crying"" and talking in a baby voice to the character Carol about their babies having sex with each other, I almost turned the show off.  That's how annoying and pathetic the ""new Phil""  was.  Where Phil was really cool the first three episode, he totally changed and became a total cringe character for the rest of the season.  It's like he wasn't even the same character who the series started off with.

The other problem is the show is great with just Phil and Carol (by the far the best episodes are just those two having at it).  The show then quickly (too quickly) introduces another character, Melissa, and the show starts rapidly going down hill after that.  And then 4 more characters get added, and it really gets worse and worse.  The first season would have been so much better if they had stretched out the comic gold between Phil and Carol, and introduced just only Melissa as the only other character late in the first season... AND kept Phil's character far more true to how his character started.

That said, the premise is great, like the cast, love the music, sets and production values are all top notch.  Worth a try, but I think it could have been SO much better.",1527552000,,2203,4.585677749360614
