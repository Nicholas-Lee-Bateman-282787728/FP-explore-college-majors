1339557,4,B00004CY5S,TIM ALLEN DOES AS USUAL A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE. THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE UNLIKE SOME OF THE SEX AND VIOLENT FILLED MOVIES OF TODAY. IGNORE TH BAD RATINGS SOME CUSTOMERS GIVE THIS MOVIE. IT IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. ITS NICE TO BE ABLE TO WATCH A MOVIE THAT THE ENTIRE FAMILY CAN ENJOY.,1144540800,9,290,4.196428571428571
1339558,1,B00004CY5S,"That chemistry does not make up for Tim Allens selfish profomance and the plot sucked. I hated  the part when the kid crawls on top of the statue of liberty. That would not fly to day, The police and the govnment would think he is a terroist and kill him. I thought the humor was bland and it is a stupid crapy movie and I hate it.",1122076800,,331,3.9402985074626864
1339559,1,B00004CY5S,"This Film is the second  most appaling film (placed just fractionaly under ""blue crush"") I  have endured in my short life. The film was so awfull that i was hugely supprised to see that walt disney had produced this film, i was aware that the standard of the films had been going down hill, but this, this was compleate and utter bilge. To start with the characters were so hugly unbelivable and cliche. Tim allen (who befor i thought of as a respected actor) who is Micheal, a highly paid trades-man in new york says to his newly found son as they are ""bonding"" in the Jungle "" how far are we going, these shoes cost me five thousand dollars"". or some other rubbish along those lines. But to be fair that could not even compare to most horrific and mind numminly stupid ending that does acually beat ""blue crush"" .When father and son unite in some slapstick comedey, you know the usual vases over heads etc. The one thing i did enjoy in ""Junle 2 Jungle"" was when Micheal (Tim Allen)  shots his cat, this in it's self wasn't funny it was the stuffed cat that was used that was funny. It seemed that Disney had run out of money, or enthusiasim and  that one of the camera men had stolen his daughters cuddley-toy cat to uses and  as Tim Allen held it up (trying to wake it up) you could see quiet blatently that is was by no way a real cat.
In conclusion, if you want to see one of the most awfull films made in history then please go ahead and buy it, wast your money if not on this then on some other some other appaling film. As i saud befor this IS  the second worst film i have ever seen",1081728000,3,1591,4.183006535947713
1339560,5,B00004CY5S,"Jungle to Jungle is a modern version of Little Indian Big City. (see my review).  Although this film is funnier, better acted(Tim Allen rocks!), and more entertaining, I didn't feel the boy(Sam Hungington) that played Mimi was born in the jungle at all.  Don't get me wrong, he is a wonderful actor and the girls will love his bod, although he did a great job he didn't come across on film as believable.  In Little Indian Big City the boy was believable.  Sam Huntington spoke as well as a Harvard lawyer and jungle boys don't speak that well since they told us straight out that he couldn't read.
This film takes place in New York City.  Little Indian Big City takes place in Paris.  Mimi climbs the Statue of Liberty, pins the neighbors pigeon against the wall, cooks his dad's friends prize fish and yes, gets the girl.
The weird thing about this film I think: A half naked boy walks down the street in New York and nothin happens to him?  Unbelievable.
I liked the film because of Tim Allen and Sam Huntington.  Allen is funny and Huntington is, well.. see the film.  You will like it.",1049760000,16,1090,4.4646464646464645
1339561,5,B00004CY5S,"I wanted to say first off, that this truly is a great comedy, a great family comedy.  And yes, it is possibly Tim Allen's best.  But to those who say you shouldn't buy this DVD of it, simply because of no extras, and the lack of an enhancement for widescreen, I say forget it.  Buy it.  It doesn't look bad.  Possibly a little bit reddish at times, but that could be what the director wanted in the first place.",1045699200,5,411,4.151898734177215
1339562,5,B00004CY5S,"I love this movie for many reasons,the biggest being that the love of my life,Frankie Galasso,is in it. Even though that's why I usually watch it,I can't say it's bad in any way. It's extreamly entertaining,and has good family moments. Definetly a must to see.",1045353600,2,260,4.8
1339563,1,B00004CY5S,"He we go again, from Angels in the outfield having an anamorfic menu, and then poor non animorphic movie, they continue the stupidity. JUNGLE TO JUNGLE is a great family movie with no doubt wonderful wide views from the top of mountains and new york, so why not just put out yet another full screen version?
The Disney DVD department contiue to screw things like this movie, the Three Musketeers and so many more....
Get with the program Disney, wide screen is here to stay, animorphic is the only way to screen it, so for gods sake do it..
DONT BUY THIS DVD>>>",1034553600,8,561,4.456310679611651

1339713,5,B00004CY5S,"Disney Studios did it again with a superb family film!  Tim Allen, Martin Short, and David Ogden Stiers were quite a comedy team that would not have been complete without the 13-year-old prodigy Sam Huntington.  The female back up actors really topped of this comedy about a Wall Street Commodities Broker who trades one concrete jungle for another south of the border to finalize a divorce - only to learn he has a giant spider-carrying, blowdart-shooting son Mimi Siku?!  His partner crosses a Russian Mob boss in a coffee bean deal that morphs into a hysterically hilarious  father and son rescue.  In between incidents Mimi's Father has to convince his Son that its improper to chase people with his matika (giant spider) or having household pets for snacks?!  This is an excellent family movie for all ages where viewers of all ages can rediscover it is all right to laugh at one another.  Definitely a five-star award DVD!",1496188800,,928,4.8354430379746836

1339834,5,B00004CY5S,"This review is really just for the movie.  I loved this movie growing up and had a huge crush on Mimi-Siku.  I like Tim Allen because he's funny without the sometimes overbearing humor that comes from actors like Jim Carey or Martin Short, the latter of whom is in this movie and plays his secondary part decently.  The main draw for this movie is the relationship between the two main characters - father and son.  The dynamic is calmly believable, which is characteristic of an Allen film - he is always at his best when working alongside kids.  Particularly impactful, though, is Sam Huntington's performance as Mimi-Siku; he brings such gentleness and honest curiosity to his character, and his portrayal of Mimi's earnest desire to make both his father and tribe proud is very authentic for the 13-year-old character he's playing.  It was a good film when I first saw it and it still is now.",1472860800,2,896,4.711538461538462

There are just so many great movies but the classic family ones are my all time favorites with out a doubt. I have shared them with my own kids growing up and now I am sharing them with my grand kids. I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down. I buy all my movies this way now, they take up no room in the house, no finding the wrong movie in the case, there are so may benefits this way.

1340450,4,B00004CY5S,"I've seen worse Tim Allen films.  And while this one isn't in the same category as the ""Toy Story"" trilogy, it still holds up.  My favorite moments are when Martin Short freaks out in the airport and later in the car...thus Martin Short is also my favorite actor in this film, the star, Tim Allen, coming in second.  While some of the culture clashes are clich&eacute;, some are humorous.  As for the jokes, some are admittedly crude, disgusting, and even disturbing, so keep younger kids away from the screen.  Other jokes are funny, like everything Martin Short does and the scene with the sleeping cat...and the reading of the cereal box.  Overall, a good film with some laughs.  I didn't quite get all the talk about stocks and the spider becoming a weapon against enemies made me feel bad for the spider being carried around like that more than anything else.  But I'll let those things go...it's still a good film.  Enjoy.",1403654400,,928,4.679012345679013

Who know that Mimi Seku would grow up to be such a nice werewolf?  Tim Allen's pretty funny in this too.  With some elements of John Booeman's  ""Emerald Forest"" in it (kid from the jungle going to the big city) and the aforementioned George of the Jungle, it's fun, funny, Tim Allen at his pre-Santa Clause best.

1340573,1,B00004CY5S,"First off, why is there a 2 in the title? This a remake, not a sequel. Seriously, why is this even a Disney film? It's not funny, and the content is certainly in appropriate for a ""family"" movie. There's discussion of the stock market, (Yeah, do you think that your kids are gonna be interested becoming stock brokers?), the Russian Mafia pops up, and some sexual innuendos, (""Nice poochie poochie. That's the LAST 'poochie poochie' you're ever gonna get!"") and even divorce problems. (Kids that are the product of a divorced household may have a hard time watching this.)

In short, Jungle 2 Jungle is not a good flick, and MOST of the content in this Disney flick seem more appropriate for a PG-13 or an R-rated comedy drama film. Ignore this and watch some other Disney movie. A GOOD ONE!",1361491200,,791,4.609929078014185

I watched this a lot on VHS as a kid, and it was one of my favorites. I was amazed that she knew of it and watched it as a kid, also, because nobody I mentioned the movie to ever knew anything about it. We watched it together, and still love it, still laugh at the same scenes, and still want to watch it a second and a third time. It's the movie that taught me the meaning of the word ""obligated"".

1340620,3,B00004CY5S,"I ordered this DVD, since I had seen it previously in Full Screen. According to the specs listed on the back, this was supposed to be Full Screen. Lo and behold, it was Wide Screen. I like Full Screen and was expecting Full, not Wide Screen. I was a bit upset over this fact. I want to be able to focus on the main action or character, with Wide Screen I get distracted by what is going on both sides of the action or character.
I still enjoyed the movie, but wished that it had been in Full Screen like it states on the box.
It is too bad that Disney only did the bare bones for it. I do love watching gag reels. I think that movies should be available in all formats (Full Screen, Wide Screen, HD, and Blu-Ray) for the consumers. Not everyone likes only having one format and studios should have all formats.",1233705600,,810,4.165605095541402

1340623,5,B00004CY5S,"It's amazing how many people write a review for a DVD they've never even purchased. There are all these other people out there who give it 1 or 2 stars because ""it's a great movie but it's full screen."" If you were to actually watch this movie on this DVD you would see that, yes, it reads full screen on the back but it is WIDESCREEN. I watched this on a huge TV and I have surround sound, and while it did not play in surround sound, I barely noticed a difference, it really did not bother me. The picture quality is fine as well, the only screw-up I see is that it is marked Full Screen and it is widescreen - and that's only annoying if you LIKE full screen. It lacks bonus features, however, many DVDs do - all the bonus features come on special edition collector's sets these days that cost more than just a full- or widescreen version. So if you love this movie but are hesitant to buy it after reading reviews stating that it is awful because it's full screen and the sound is terrible, you're missing out. Clearly many of these past reviewers who gave this movie bad ratings didn't view this disk. This is a wonderful, memorable, funny movie, great for kids and family.
