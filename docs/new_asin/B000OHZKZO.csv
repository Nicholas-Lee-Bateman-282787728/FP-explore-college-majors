2795080,5,B000OHZKZO,This is a great deal! If you buy both seasons together you definately save. This is based on the British version and is just as funny if not better. I'm very happy with my purchase.,1183852800,,181,4.2
2795081,5,B000OHZKZO,"This is an amazing sitcom.  I could watch this DVD series again and again, infact I do and it drives my husband nuts.  The best part is that if you work in an office, you know all of these characters.  Somebody in your office will remind you of one of these characters.  This is a wonderful sitcom and I hope it never ends.  I live for Thursday nights on NBC!  Love it! Love it!",1183680000,2,378,4.04054054054054
2795082,5,B000OHZKZO,"This show is absolutely the best show I've ever seen! The humor is brilliant.

2795125,1,B000OHZKZO,"Are you kidding me?  $500 for a USED ""The Office: Severance Package""?  Yeah, it's nice to have all the little extras and whatnot, but I think I'll go down to Circuit City or Best Buy and get the two things that really matter (the seasons) for a total of $35.",1211846400,2,258,4.14
2795126,5,B000OHZKZO,"But you already know how hilarious the show is...and if you don't then you need to buy this!! This comedy is original, fresh, funny, sarcastic and is incomparable to any other show I've ever seen. Imagine if a cast from SNL invaded your office...that is the best I can do to describe it...simply too good!!",1208476800,,306,4.581818181818182

2795129,5,B000OHZKZO,This was a birthday gift.  I was glad I didn't have to worry about size or color.  The gentleman loved his gift.,1197504000,,112,4.045454545454546
2795130,5,B000OHZKZO,"The Office is truly one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  The wrting is so smart, and the acting is just fabulous - everyone is just spot-on all the time.  I love going back to my favorite episodes (Diversity Day being my very favorite!) whenever I need a laugh - works like a charm every time.  The extras on the DVD alone are worth the price!  Each season is equally as funny as the one before - be sure to get Season 3, too!  :)",1195776000,,438,3.9885057471264367
2795131,5,B000OHZKZO,"Season one is short, there are only a couple episodes.  The DVD came quickly and is amazingly funny!  I highly recommend this!",1195257600,,126,4.681818181818182
2795132,1,B000OHZKZO,"You can get the same thing, brand new, off of Ebay for $39.99 or less if you want to bid.  I came to Amazon hoping for a better deal.",1194825600,,133,3.586206896551724
2795133,5,B000OHZKZO,"With an essemble cast lead by the very funny Steve Carell (from The 40-Year-Old Virgin and The Daily Show) this show gets better and better each season. While season one contains the initial 8 episodes of the series, season 2 delivers 22 outstanding episodes! (plus Blooper Reel and Deleted Scenes). Buying this bundle is the best way to go if you want to start your Office DVD collection.",1194652800,,389,4.735294117647059
2795174,5,B000OHZKZO,"When I began watching Season 1 of ""The Office,"" I have to say I didn't really ""get it.""  By the end of Episode 5, I knew I was hooked.  Wilson (Dwight) and Carell (Michael) are pure genius.  For anybody who has ever worked in an office where there are many personalities, you will be entertained for hours.  Season 2 is my all-time favorite, especially ""Booze Cruise"" and ""Casino Night.""  I was completely sucked in by the Jim and Pam storyline.  I highly recommend the bloopers and deleted scenes;  hilarious! Not for small children, but many older teens enjoy the comedy.",1194134400,,573,4.67
2795175,5,B000OHZKZO,"This TV series is just gold. It's amazing just how funny this show can be. I think it has a quality that we can all relate to: every job sucks at one point or another. Who hasn't had one boss that was an idiot? Both seasons are equally funny, but I'm kinda partial to the second season. This is a great buy :)",1193961600,,309,3.9206349206349205
2795176,5,B000OHZKZO,I am already a fan...so with that said- love it!  I have even passed it on to friends to watch.,1193702400,,95,3.75
2795177,5,B000OHZKZO,"I knew this show was funny, but I never really made an effort to keep up with the show. So, on my birthday I asked my sister to buy me the box set for season 2 and now I am hooked! I watched season 1, 2 and 3 in two days! Dwight is so hilarious, Pam and Jim's secret interest in each other kept me wanting more! I needed to know what was going to happen next. I really enjoy watching this show. I haven't been so hooked on a show in years. Give it a chance.",1193529600,,457,3.7216494845360826
2795178,5,B000OHZKZO,The office season 1 and 2 are simply amazing. Do not pass up this deal,1193443200,,70,3.7333333333333334
2795179,5,B000OHZKZO,"Great price on this 2 set..Gave it for a gift,which was a big hit! Best episodes are on season 2 of the entire season, in my opinion.",1193356800,,133,3.962962962962963
2795180,5,B000OHZKZO,"I saw a few snippets of episodes on TV and wasn't too terribly impressed.  Upon watching the series from the beginning, however, I was hooked.  Now, having watched all 3 seasons on DVD I must say that this is one of the smartest, funniest, and above all re-watchable TV series out there.  If you've ever worked for ""The Man,"" I'd highly recommend you purchase The Office.",1193270400,,371,4.590909090909091
2795181,5,B000OHZKZO,"I don't think I even need to say what a great show this is.  If you're looking at the dvds, you probably already know that this show is one of the best comedies on tv right now.  I don't buy tv shows on dvd very much, but I've never known them to be this reasonably priced, for two seasons no less.  Granted, the first season is only six episodes, but still, it's a good price.  I haven't even tried watching the first season yet to be honest, but the second season's dvd is not disappointing.  There are probably ten minutes of deleted scenes for every episode, and each has a commentary as well, with the cast switching half and half for each episode, plus some of the writers, directors, and producers.  There are also a lot of funny extras, like fake public service announcements and the like.  Overall, the show itself is entertaining enough for me to make the purchase worth it, but there are great extras as well.  I would recommend it to any office fan, or anyone just looking for a smart comedy for that matter.",1193270400,,1020,4.388297872340425
2795182,5,B000OHZKZO,"Whoever gave this 1 star has issues. This show is awesome, once you've seen a few episodes you'll know why it has won so many awards, including the coveted Emmy. Hilarious show, a laugh for every line, perfection. This is a great deal for the price too, the first season has like 6 episodes but the second has many, so it makes up for it. Buy it!",1192924800,4,346,4.17910447761194
2795183,5,B000OHZKZO,"The combination of Mike, Dwight, Jim and Pam and all the other office characters makes for a laughfilled evening, where you're constantly thinking...I can't believe he just did that!!!",1192752000,,184,5.379310344827586
2795234,5,B000OHZKZO,"""The Office"" is easily the funniest show on prime-time TV.  The documentary style leaves no room for the canned laughter that drives me nuts on most sitcoms, and I think the ""talking head"" interviews are fantastic.  Each character is funny and poignant, and the scripts are never lacking originality.  I love the idea of taking something hum-drum, like office life, and finding the humor in the daily goings-on.  I could watch this show for hours on end, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a bit of a wry sense of humor.  You won't be disappointed.  One of my favorites?  When Michael grills his foot on the George Foreman ... classic.",1192665600,,641,4.669642857142857

2795236,5,B000OHZKZO,"I enjoyed all these episodes the first time around, and am loving re-watching them with my husband. It's become a nightly event, choosing to watch these dvds even over new shows airing this fall. You can't beat the comedy that runs rampant at Dunder Mifflin.

The characters are so well thought out and the actors make them as true and authentic as can be. The writing and improv is top notch and I am pleased to laugh outloud at least a couple of times for every episode. This is by far one of the best comedy series ever.",1191628800,4,523,4.336734693877551
2795237,5,B000OHZKZO,Everything about The Office DVDs is hilarious.  I watch at least one episode everyday.  I can't get enough of them.  If you need to laugh just watch The office,1190592000,,159,4.413793103448276

2795239,5,B000OHZKZO,My boyfriend and I watched all 3 seasons in one week.  It was liek we were hooked on crack.  We could not get enough.  Now we feel so sad that we are done.  So eager for the new season to start.  I promise you will not be sorry this show is amazing!!!!  Everything about it is AMAZING!!!!,1190419200,2,288,3.9649122807017543
2795240,5,B000OHZKZO,"Absolutely hillarious! I think the rest of the cast combined is what makes the show, not necessarily Steve Carrell, who is funny enough as it is. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh! :)",1190419200,,212,4.605263157894737
2795241,5,B000OHZKZO,"The season re-runs are essential for fans of THE OFFICE. I
never seem to tire of the re-runs......I pick up something
new each time I watch.  It is simply the funniest, cleverest,
most perfectly casted and directed show I have ever watched.
This ""sit-com"" is heads and tails over any other in history -
and one of the reasons is NO LAUGH TRACK. Savvy viewers know
what is funny and don't need prompting to laugh.  The whole cast
is brilliant.",1189987200,,442,4.5125
2795242,5,B000OHZKZO,"My husband and I watch this series together since we both work in the corporate world and find this show totally hilarious!!  If we want to de-stress, we just slip in these DVDs and laugh non-stop.  I can't wait to buy the full series.  Highly recommended!",1189641600,,256,4.521739130434782
2795243,1,B000OHZKZO,"If I could rate this at 0 stars I would.  This is yet another knockoff of a BBC hit show.  Episode 1 is almost word for word verbatim to the first episode of the British version.  Aren't there any real screenwriters in Hollywood anymore.  Very, Very, Very disappointing to say the least.",1189036800,,287,4.461538461538462
2795264,5,B000OHZKZO,"The only other show that I've lost sleep on a work night for was the first 3 seasons of Sopranos (I know the two have nothing in common).  I won't summarize the show, but I want to tell anyone who has not seen this show, to please, please, give it until the second season to decide whether or not you like it.  The first season is good, but the storylines don't thicken until the second season, and that is when it gets super fun/addictive.",1189036800,,440,4.226190476190476
2795265,5,B000OHZKZO,"The Office is a great show.  I think it is so funny.  If you like a good laugh, then you should check out The Office.",1188432000,,117,3.64
2795266,4,B000OHZKZO,"This series' greatest strength is deftly and accurately capturing the mundane nature of the cubicle lifestyle. The series starts off slow, then manically picks up into a cascade of oddly familiar hilarity. From the boss that flagrantly defies basic manners, to the the tattletale, to the fellow coworkers who like to pull outlandish pranks, the characters manage to seem like stereotypes of people everyone knows and also people in their own right.

I particularly like the nearly-Marxist differentiation between the ""office folk"" and the ""warehouse folk;"" and the setting (Scranton, PA, the ultimate abandoned coal mining town, where I'm from).

The pleasure of this series is increased tenfold when the viewer actually works 9-5. Thank goodness someone finally understands, viewers think. Every office becomes a The Office, and viewers begin to ""play at home"" -- to wonder how, like Jim and Pam, they can make their situation a little more interesting.",1187827200,,954,5.311258278145695
2795267,5,B000OHZKZO,"I was totally unsure of this show the first time I saw it.  I had heard that it was SOOO FUNNY- and then I watched an episode....I had no clue why people raved about it so much.  However, now that I have had the chance to watch it from the beginning- I LOVE IT!  You have to get to know the charachters.  Once you do, everything falls into place- and it is hilarious!  So much fun, really. :)",1187827200,,392,3.9743589743589745
2795268,5,B000OHZKZO,This set is great!!!! Exceeded my expectations. I love all the deleted scenes and the out-takes.,1187827200,,96,5.0625
2795269,5,B000OHZKZO,"I loved watching the first two seasons of The Office.  It was wonderful to get the DVDs in a double pack - convenient and much cheaper than individually :)

This show is a groundbreaker!  It's so politically incorrect - the humor is unmatched by other shows!  Each episode is chock full of hilarious scenarios and witty dialogue!

I will be a fan of this show as long as it's on and I look forward to receiving the 3rd season soon!",1187049600,,431,4.3375

2795271,5,B000OHZKZO,"The Office seasons 1+2 are a great investment!  The Office is one of the funniest shows out there and makes me laugh everytime I watch it, usually more than once per episode.",1186531200,,174,4.4375
2795272,5,B000OHZKZO,"First, let me say that Amazon was super speedy in getting this product to me. It came way before the suspected date of arrival, which was nice.

I fell in love with the office. And can never fully see every show due to my schedule, so ordering the DVD set was a must.

I love that you can pop it in anytime and watch an episode (Most are 20 min long or so). I watched it on a flight and it was perfect to make the time fly...LOL.

This is a show that will be funny for ages! And in every store I have been into...it is this much to get just season 2 by itself, so this was a no- brainer on price!

Order it and you WILL love it! :)",1186444800,,631,3.757575757575758
2795273,5,B000OHZKZO,"As a fan of the series The Office, I was especially pleased with the season two collection, which has special features such as outtakes and shorts as part of the set.  Season one didn't offer this, but the series itself is so good, I was still satisfied.",1186358400,,254,4.404255319148936
2795395,5,B000OHZKZO,"If you've ever worked in an office, you'll roll out of your seat laughing at this show.  I recommend it to anyone.  The great writing and style this is shot in make it unique and always catches me laughing, even if I've seen the episode ten times.",1186272000,,247,4.23404255319149
2795396,5,B000OHZKZO,"""The Office"" is one of the best shows that have come out in the past couple of years. The writing is excellent; capturing great office pranks, along with a horribly non-PC boss that actually makes you feel embarrassed. The show also has a good story going. I can't wait to get season 3, and relive the entire series thus-far. I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.

It is not for everyone though. I have found that many people who have trouble staying focused find the show boring. The comedy is at times dry, but that's the best part. The dry humor adds a touch of realism that very few shows have.

I give it 5 stars - definitely one series that should be in your collection!",1186099200,,700,4.33587786259542

2795398,5,B000OHZKZO,"The Office is the funniest show on tv.  The jokes Jim plays on Dwight are priceless.  Steve Carell is the best at dry humor.  There are tons of deleted scenes and outtakes.  Season 1 is only six episodes, but it is well worth it.",1185753600,,229,4.136363636363637
2795399,4,B000OHZKZO,"I am an enormous fan of the original UK series and wasn't impressed with my first viewing of the US adaptation. But in the second season, the series found its own voice with clever writing and superb ensemble acting. And I greatly appreciate them omitting a laugh track and letting us provide our own. I look forward to season 3 on DVD for the extras and to season 4 on TV for the ongoing story lines. If you loved the original, but have avoided the adaptation, give it another shot. You can enjoy them both.",1185408000,2,508,4.3578947368421055
2795400,5,B000OHZKZO,"We love this tv show!! One of the best comedies on television. This is an adaptation of a british show. Not a show for kids, adult humor, and probably not for those who are offended easily.",1185062400,2,189,4.277777777777778
2795401,5,B000OHZKZO,"I love ""The Office"" and seasons one and two did not disappoint.

2795402,5,B000OHZKZO,"We loved the British ""Office"" and didn't think the stateside version would compare, but it's just as hilarious in its own right. The cast is so real - and so stinking funny. The DVD is great because it's fun to watch the commentary that gives you all the behind-the-scenes low-down. The first season is short, it's true. But it doesn't matter. Every fan needs this in his video library.",1184630400,2,386,4.608695652173913
2795403,5,B000OHZKZO,"This show is absolutely hilarious, although it is a special kind of humor. I would obviously reccomend watching some episodes on tv before ordering, but this is probably the best deal you'll find for a two season combo. The first season is only 1 disc (i think 6 episodes) but the second season is a full 22 or 24 episode season. Can't wait for season three to come out.",1184544000,2,370,4.3768115942028984

The first season  of the show isn't as good as the second, but still has some great moments and helps to establish the characters and the relationships that will become the basis of the show.

Inappropriate, awkward, and socially desperate, Michael entertains his office at Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, PA day in and day out.  Some episodes and characters are all too relatable to characters and situations we all know and have been in, and some are so mortifying you know you would die if you worked there.  Seasons one and two are the beginnings of it all - adapted directly from Ricky Gervais' British version, there are many similiarities at first.  As the seasons progress, the show takes on a life of it's own.  Definitely a hilarious watch!",1294617600,,661,4.8053097345132745
8184982,5,B000OHZKZO,"Remaking movies is bad enough, but remaking TV shows is even worse -- when that happens, there's ninety-nine atrocious shows for one good one.

But ""The Office"" is that one in a hundred that's good. Scratch that -- it's that one in a million that is AS GOOD as the Ricky Gervais series it sprang from, while still having its own unique flavour. ""The Office: Seasons One & Two"" brings together the first half-season and the full second season, which are full of outrageous corporate disasters filmed in a mockumentary style. It's absolutely sidesplitting.

The action takes place at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, presided over by Michael Scott (Steve Carell), a wannabe comic who claims to be a pal to all the people under him, despite driving them all up the wall. There's also the ""fascist nerd"" Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), bored everyman Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), and the beautiful secretary Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), whom Jim hopelessly longs for.

In the first season, Michael is ordered to do some downsizing, which he spends the whole season trying to avoid. Jim and Pam spend a great deal of time mocking the rigid Dwight, even starting an ""alliance"" with him, Survivor-style. And the Scranton employees are faced with a disastrous basketball game, Michael's version of a diversity seminar, a sexy purse salesgirl, and (most horribly) a Dwight-planned health care package.

The downsizing problem continues well into the second season, where the Scranton employees are faced with more ""typical"" corporate problems -- workplace awards (the ""Dundies""), sexual harassment, a workplace fire, email spying, Secret Santa, drug testing (""Do you want to give Michael your urine?""), a house party Michael isn't invited to, sales conventions, and ""Take Your Daughter To Work"" Day.

Of course, all these are given a more bizarre twist by Michael's constant attempts to make the office a ""fun"" place (stealing Christmas gifts!!), and Dwight's equally peculiar antics (a public speech using lines from Hitler and Mussolini... courtesy of Jim). And Jim's feelings for Pam get more cumbersome as her engagement slowly creeps toward marriage with the loutish Roy, and Michael enters a sort-of-relationship with his exasperated boss Jan.

Don't expect a typical sitcom in ""The Office."" No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, some. And no episode has a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry, because it's all so familiar... yet so twisted.

The first season (which is rather short at only six episodes) is also heavily flavoured with the British series' humour, right down to the stapler-in-Jell-O joke. But most of the humor belongs to this show alone -- loads of pranks from Jim and Pam (""That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion""), horrendously awkward problems (Dwight trying to find drugs in the office) and intertwined storylines about office romance and conflict.  But the best part is the dialogue -- deadpan, unspeakably funny dialogue, on any topic (""I need a username, and... I have a great one. 'Little Kid Lover.' That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at"").

Steve Carell has some big shoes to fill, but his earnestly manic, unconsciously offensive Michael Scott makes a brilliant boss that you would sell a kidney to avoid working under. Wilson is equally brilliant as the totally bizarre dork Dwight (""Last year I came to work with my spud-gun in a duffle bag""), while Krasinski and Fischer are quite likable as the mischievous everyman and his soul-mate (who is unhappily engaged to another man).

More subtle and yet goofier than just about any other American sitcom, ""The Office"" translates British humour into a great post-mockumentary comedy. Funny, witty, and horrifyingly true to life.",1272672000,,3943,5.16614420062696

8184984,5,B000OHZKZO,"Remaking movies is bad enough, but remaking TV shows is even worse -- when that happens, there's ninety-nine atrocious shows for one good one.

But ""The Office"" is that one in a hundred that's good. Scratch that -- it's that one in a million that is AS GOOD as the Ricky Gervais series it sprang from, while still having its own unique flavour. ""The Office: Seasons One & Two"" brings together the first half-season and the full second season, which are full of outrageous corporate disasters filmed in a mockumentary style. It's absolutely sidesplitting.

The action takes place at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin (a paper corporation), presided over by Michael Scott (Steve Carell), a wannabe comic who claims to be a pal to all the people under him, despite driving them all up the wall. There's also the ""fascist nerd"" Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), bored everyman Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), and the beautiful secretary Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), whom Jim hopelessly longs for.

In the first season, Michael is ordered to do some downsizing, which he spends the whole season trying to avoid. In the meantime, Jim and Pam spend a great deal of time mocking the rigid Dwight, even starting an ""alliance"" with him, Survivor-style. And the Scranton employees are faced with a disastrous basketball game, Michael's version of a diversity seminar, a sexy purse salesgirl, and (most horribly) a Dwight-planned health care package.

The downsizing problem continues well into the second season, where the Scranton employees are faced with more ""typical"" corporate problems --  workplace awards (the ""Dundies""), sexual harassment, a workplace fire, email spying, Secret Santa, drug testing (""Do you want to give Michael your urine?""), a house party Michael isn't invited to, sales conventions, and ""Take Your Daughter To Work"" Day that ends in a disaster.

Of course, all these are given a more bizarre twist by Michael's constant attempts to make the office a ""fun"" place (stealing Christmas gifts!!), and Dwight's equally peculiar antics (a public speech using lines from Hitler and Mussolini... courtesy of Jim). In the meantime, Jim's feelings for Pam get more cumbersome as her engagement slowly creeps toward marriage with the loutish Roy, and Michael enters a sort-of-relationship with his exasperated boss Jan.

Don't expect a typical sitcom in ""The Office."" No laughtracks. No punch lines. No gag humor... well, okay there's some. And no episode has a clear-cut ending. Instead, we have the format seen in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and the Christopher Guest mockumentaries -- hidden cameras watching the madness. And what those cameras see is enough to make the world's cubicle-dwellers cry, because it's all so familiar... yet so twisted.
