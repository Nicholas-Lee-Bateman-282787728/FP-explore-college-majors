3892529,5,B002AWJEU8,Great show and a fantastic production that deserves to be seen and saved. I was very happy!,1258070400,,91,4.411764705882353
3892530,5,B002AWJEU8,"I had ordered this DVD along with the new Joe Bonamassa DVD at Royal Albert Hall May '09 at the same time.  I tend to like more blues based music whatever genre (hence the Bonamassa DVD) and have always thought Steve Vai to be one of the creme de la creme guitar player / musician / creator's out there.  For me I was never really into shred type guitar playing, but this is a whole different level.  I have known about Steve Vai since his Frank Zappa days but have never had any recordings of his in my own collection except for the Clapton Crossroads concert and watching him in the movie Crossroads guitar showdown with that kid playing the Telecaster.  So that makes me a nubie so to speak.  I play guitar and have read many articles about Vai and his gear etc. over the past 20+ years or so.  Previous post summarized maybe heavy metal Grateful Dead?  I am thinking more on the lines of John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu on steroids.  Whatever, it doesn't really matter.  Blah blah blah, I am running on here.

Well this DVD shows just how talented this guy is from this concert date from 2 years ago.  Anyone who knows about Steve Vai has always known how talented he is and what he can bring.  The band members are absolutely amazingly talented with their own energy that they bring and would think Vai would have nothing less since he is the main guy.  I did not know that Steve sings and was kind of surprised at his decent vocal quality.

Already having stated his talent, Mr. Vai is really a great showmen with his humor and antics while playing which makes this DVD all the more fun and jaw dropping with mind boggling musical arrangements. I just love the two violins of Alex Depue and Ann Marie Calhoun that compliment so well.  Jeremy Colson the drummer is tireless and will totally blew you away.  This young man's energy is a force to be reckoned with.  Bryan Beller with his 5 string bass is so good along with second guitarist Dave Weiner playing a 7 string guitar which really adds that additional bottom chunk and gets to be spot lighted on his own.  Second guitarist is an oxymoron.  This guy is great!  Play this DVD or Blue-Ray, whatever you got loud.  Seeing is believing what musical human beings are capable of.  WOW!",1257984000,6,2239,4.4496314496314495
3892531,5,B002AWJEU8,"I bought this on a whim.  What an incredible guitar player. It's as mesmerizing to watch him play as it is to listen.
He has created his own genre, and I'm going to buy more of his music. Nearest I can come to calling it is classical heavy metal...that doesn't even do it justice...the Grateful Dead of Heavy Metal?  Maybe.

Best concert video I have seen in years. You will not be disappointed.",1257638400,,395,4.383561643835616
3892532,5,B002AWJEU8,"I was even in the fourth or fifth row far to Steve Vai's left.  Although I can't point myself out in the crowd, even during those camera shots, I was there and I recognized one of the people in the audience.  This was a guy who I remember was in the front row, pretty close to the center, and he had an Yngwie Malmsteen shirt.

Okay, about the DVD.  There were a few seconds of talking edited out here and there, and I was a bit disappointed about that, but it wasn't really that big a deal.  I remember him performing another song during the encore just before ""Liberty,"" but it's either missing from the DVD or I'm just remembering incorrectly.  I also assumed that they didn't film his front act's performance, but his front act came out during the show and played lap steel for a couple of tunes.  For the viewer watching the show on DVD, they see a special guest, for the people who were there, it felt kind of like a friend was coming onto the stage.

This concert shows Steve Vai's talent as a guitar player, but I have to give just as much recognition to his amazing band.  Steve Vai has said that he can't spend more than a few years with one band at a time.  I was expecting to see Billy Sheehan on bass that night, but what I got was something very different.  Say goodbye to the quadruple guitar playing and hello to a mix of violin and guitar.  Alex DePue had an electric violin strapped around him, which was probably good for switching between keyboard and violin.  Ann Marie Calhoun was an amazing violinist, with a bit more of a traditional classical sort of style, and... I don't want to say anything about how she looked.  Bryan Beller was a great bass player, and was a much better choice for this band than Billy Sheehan.  Jeremy Colson had played drums for Steve Vai with the previous band, and of all of the drummers that Steve Vai had played with, Jeremy Colson probably has the most rock in his playing.

Dave Weiner has returned, yet again, because he's such a help for Steve Vai.  When your first gig with Steve Vai is doing the tour where Alive in an Ultra World was recorded, you have a lot of weight on your shoulders.  When you're mentioned as more important to the recording than the artist who released it, by the artist himself, I'm not sure if the artist will want to get rid of you.

Except for Bryan Beller, each artist gets their own moment in the spotlight with Steve Vai himself being off the stage.  Dave Weiner's tune was pretty good.  I can say watch out Steve.  Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun did a duet that included ""Eugene's Trick Bag.""  And what's a concert without a drum solo?

Steve Vai's moments were great.  His playing was amazing, he had great stage presence, and his singing for the songs with singing was also pretty good.  I will mention the acoustic set as a highlighting moment, but the rest of the show was also great.  There is a lot of great jamming to enjoy and cherish again and again with this DVD set.",1256688000,,2970,4.343012704174229
3892533,5,B002AWJEU8,"At last, at last! This is the Steve Vai DVD I have been waiting for. A FULL performance...and a GREAT performance...documented with clean production and just the right amount of video spice.

Steve Vai edited this video himself, and it's clear that he learned from his missteps on the ""Live at the London Astoria"" video. THIS time, the camera angles show the action with energy but without undue frenetics. The cuts are well paced. The special effects are slipped in tastefully and in a ways that add to the experience and the fun.

Best of all, the performance is nothing short of AWESOME - everything you'd expect and more. The new band format is fresh and dynamic. Alex DePue and Ann Marie Calhoun bring solid rock and delicate classical sensibilities to their violin parts...and Ann Marie practically steals the show with her first statement of the melody in ""For The Love Of God."" Beautiful.

It's always great fun to see Steve's unique musical and theatrical vision come to life. This DVD finally gives that vision the entertaining, challenging and exciting showcase it deserves. Well done!",1256083200,,1096,4.9135135135135135
3892534,5,B002AWJEU8,"All the other reviews are spot on. I saw a show on this tour and after seeing it I felt I did not need to see any other shows because I was flat out amazed. So 2 years later this comes out and it amazed me again. Steve hit all the right notes and gave his band a lot of camera time and a lot of chances to show thier chops. It's well done from top to bottom. Do not think twice about this purchase. Sound, editing and playing  are all top notch Vai quality. I can't go track by track but some of the many standouts are Building a church, Freakshow excess, Angel Food and Tuarus Bulba. The show is not all intensity. There are some funny moments where Steve is pretty playful and the warmth shows, the bands warmth shows. This will not only blow you away but put a huge grin on your face.  I have not seen all the bonus features yet, but the band interviews so far are enjoyable.",1254700800,3,878,4.040229885057471
3892535,5,B002AWJEU8,"You can bet that if Vai's putting out a DVD, you're going to get your money's worth and then some.  The musicianship is as high as can be expected, and if you're even somewhat familiar with Vai's work, this is no surprise.

What I enjoyed the most were the production values (lighting and DVD specific effects), the little touches of bizarre humor that he's known for (picking with his guitar tech, showing the scat lyrics to Firewall, shamelessly plugging himself in Tender Surrender), and the way he shared the stage with the other musicians.  That last aspect impressed me the most, actually.  He knows he can play, so he had no problem letting the band step up.  Instead of ""Dave's Party Piece"", he actually got to play one of his own songs from his album (albeit, and abbreviated version).  Also, the Lydian jam with Anne Marie and Alex on ""The Crying Machine"" was just magical.

Like I said, if you're a Vai fan, you're gonna get this DVD, so I'm basically writing this for the casual listener/musician.  If you're interested in something different from the cookie cutter commercial garbage that out there.  Give this a listen, you might learn something!",1254528000,21,1160,4.76
3892536,5,B002AWJEU8,Steve Vai shows in this concert DVD why he's one of the greatest guitarists on this planet.  He plays so effortlessly and with such enthusiasm. The members of the band are top notch musicians who compliment Vai's intensity on stage.  The sound quality of this disc is superb and the camera work and editing are perfect. You can see Vai's mastery of the frets clearly because the cameras are focused on him every time he unleashes one of his jaw dropping solos. This disc is a must have for any Steve Vai fan or any guitarist looking for inspiration.,1254528000,2,549,4.5353535353535355
3892537,5,B002AWJEU8,"I know others will go deep with analysis of this product, so I will just state what I think is the most important element.  This show seems to have been edited by someone who is not only aware of this type of music, but also a fan.  I cannot handle nonstop 2 second cuts to every camera view that I could care less about.  The days of the frantic MTV style video presentation are OVER.  This DVD is perfect in that aspect, when Steve is going for the ""part"", you WILL get to see it.  And there is also just the right amount of effects and movement to keep it interesting & fresh.  Any musician who actually cares about the music, should pay attention to ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and use this as a reference point for any Producer or Director who will be in charge of presenting an artists true vision in the arena of concert recording.

3892539,3,B002AWJEU8,"I have a love/hate relationship with Steve Vai work.  There is incredible piece from him mixed with piece where it is more like a demo of his skill...

This live goes unfortunately on a full review of Vai skill as a musician and ends up:
- Way too long (two DVD)
- Annoying in particular with the constant mix of Vai musical ability and other musicians (including violin player)

That was way too much for me and I stopped at the first DVD.",1391731200,,440,4.27710843373494
3892540,5,B002AWJEU8,This was the first album of Vai's that I listened to. Blew me away. He is today's ultimate master of the guitar.

You may get pissed with the 1 second camera shots in some songs which looks cheesy... Video effects aren't a Steve Vai thingie for serious concerts but this one has some BS which hard core Vai fans may not like  ... (like the live at Astoria) ... But never the less.

3892548,5,B002AWJEU8,"This DVD was a wonderful break from the ""normal"" main-stream music scene.  It was full of creativity and a lot more passion.  The band definitely works together wonderfully, and they bring to light a brilliant new mix of audio and visual aspects.  I was greatly impressed with the editing, personal comments, and finesse that went into the making of this set.  Vai shined as always, and the addition of the new violinist was a nice treat. Vai played with passion and made his guitars sound absolutely beautiful and riveting at the same time.  His arrangements and singing helped show his crazy side as well as wowing the audience with some favorites.  The band showed a little of their personal sides, and the great teamwork that they have in order to pull off such a great show.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see an awesome show, and hear some of the greatest musical talent of our time!",1321056000,,909,4.608695652173913
3892549,5,B002AWJEU8,"I think Steve enjoys the 'shock factor' when it comes to his playing...he is so good, that I think his fantastic guitar playing is becoming second nature and now he wants to see what limits he can push and still sound great - this DVD did it - obtaining 2 great violinists to 'duel' back and forth with and some stunning harmonies. And Dave is actually getting better! His song was pretty good compared to that 'Party song he did from 'Live at the Astoria'.
This is a new look and feel from Vai, and you won't be disappointed - all the musicians are great and Steve should sing more, he has a good voice.....",1308268800,,608,4.2956521739130435

Well, it has been topped and Steve Vai did it with this DVD release, ""Where the Wild Things Are"". I'm not going to write a long, sappy review but simply state to you... I highly highly recommend this DVD!!!  -  Enjoy!",1294963200,2,376,4.597014925373134
3892552,4,B002AWJEU8,Excellent performance by Steve and Co. Well filmed with excellent audio. Well worth purchasing. Steve's playing at times in almost incomprehensible with regards to technique and execution.,1288828800,,188,6.0
3892553,5,B002AWJEU8,"I saw Steve & co. in one of the best live shows I've ever seen on this tour in New Jersey, so imagine my delight when I heard that he was putting out a DVD/bluray from the same tour! Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed. In fact, frankly, I was thoroughly blown away.

Chances are, you're familiar with Mr Vai's unhuman chops. I must say that the band he chose for this tour was, by all accounts, very much up to the challenge of playing with a musician of this magnitude. The violinists on this show were amazing and truly added another dimension to Steve's already beautiful and multi-layered music. All the musicians here played together with such harmony that you'd swear they'd been doing it for years. (Some of them have) Also appreciated was the fact that everyone was given their moment to shine. The duet between Alex DePue and the absolutely STUNNING Ann Marie Calhoun left me in awe, wanting to go buy a violin. But not only were the chops all-around fantastic, but more importantly, you could tell that every member was really enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives, and putting their heart and soul into every note played.

As far as the direction of the video, I pretty much considered it flawless. People who buy a Steve Vai video buy it to watch him play guitar. And with Where the Wild Things Are, you won't miss a note. The cameras always knew where to be, which on occasion was focused very closely on Mr. Vai's hands during very difficult passages. Now I know it was filmed in 720p rather than 1080p like some have complained, but I will say that on my 36"" 720p television, it was rather spaklingly good quality.

In short, if you love complex music, amazing musicianship, and just a flat-out mind-blowingly good show, BUY THIS DVD (or bluray or whatever) By the end you will be so in awe of what you just watched, you'll need to watch it again and again.",1273536000,2,1893,4.497093023255814
3892554,5,B002AWJEU8,"steve vai where the wild thing are,is a very exciting dvd the musicians are amazing besides steve vai ann marie calhoun is one of the best violin player i`ve seen if you have to listen to violin music she`ll be the one i`ll listen too she`s georgeous and an extremely talented musician, other than that a very different live dvd vai put together theres even gags on his show , so if your a steve vai fan this should definely be in your collection, amazing",1266883200,,455,4.364705882352941
3892555,5,B002AWJEU8,"Well over a decade of touring behind his own music with his own band after years of being a ""Hired Gun"" (albeit a Hired Gun of *tremendous* talent and technical ability) for the likes of Frank Zappa, David Lee Roth, Whitesnake and others, Vai has taken a ""cue"" (if you'll pardon the pun) of his orchestral work with Holland's Metropole Orkest and disbanded his touring band that had existed with different players but the same format since 1995.  Even as a longtime fan, I had grown tired of *two* additional backing guitarists (with one doubling on keyboards and Billy Sheehan, an extraordinary bassist but one who very much plays as a ""Bass Guitarist"", virtually playing guitar lines an octave below) on-stage with Vai and therefore able to play the EXACT harmonies, overlapping parts, and generally sounding almost exactly like his studio albums.

However, from his aforementioned scoring his music for an Orchestra and having a show recorded and released on CD & DVD (as Steve Vai: Visual Sound Theories) it appears that Steve felt the same way and for this tour set up an almost completely new band (only drummer Jeremy Colson and Rhythm Guitarist Dave Weiner were carried over) based around 2 violinist to better reflect both the orchestra sound as well as mindset: Ann Marie Calhoun & Alex DePue.  Both are immense talents and bring a vast musical change to Vai's music compared to his previous bands.  Each also has their own unique style that is captured beautifully on this release - Calhoun sounds much more classically-based and precise, whereas DePue has much more of a ""Fiddler"" aspect to his style and sounds far more wild and improvised.  Together they complement each other terrifically, and when either playing their own parts, doubling or harmonizing with Vai, or in their soloing they bring a new energy I feel was lacking in Vai's last several tours due to the sheer over-abundance of multiple *guitar* parts played as well as heard sonically.

Special mention must go out to drummer Jeremy Colson and Bassist Bryan Beller.  As opposed to former bassist Sheehan's guitar-like style, Beller is much more a BASS PLAYER in both the notes he plays and the tone he uses.  Thus, his playing style creates a true ""Rhythm Section"" with Colson compared to Sheehan's playing far more with the guitars and not the drums.  This hardly means Beller is a wallflower in this band - with the complexity of Vai's music and bass parts, he holds down the bottom-end with the energy and technical precision that only a Berklee School of Music Honors Graduate can, and truly shines during the ""Rock"" songs that the Violins and Rhythm Guitar sits out and all three (Lead Guitar, Bass & Drums) can spread out in the legendary ""Power Trio"" format such as in the song ""Juice"".  On the other side of this, drummer Colson is frighteningly hard-hitting and yet capable of complex fills and time-signature changes while in lockstep with bassist Beller.  These two make a fearsome duo, and I hope Vai has the ability to use them whenever he tours next.

...and then there's Steve ""The Little Italian Virtuoso"" Vai.  He combines a technical ability on the guitar that few, if any can replicate.  While I can understand how some ""traditionalists"" might be turned off by his wardrobe & guitar changes, on-stage persona and general ""Showman"" vibe, he's recognized that playing mostly instrumental pieces (he sings on a few numbers and does so well, but he's first and foremost a guitarist) indeed CALLS for his theatrics in the live venue.  It's a catch-22: if not, people would be complaining that it's a ""boring"" show full of technical music and little else.  Vai's on-stage playfulness, his banter between songs, and his love for music is clear and makes for a worthwhile show.

On a technical level, this release is MILES above Vai's 2001 ""Live at the Astoria"" DVD.  The cost to shoot a fairly small-scale show has dropped dramatically between then and now, and the increase in the quality of Digital Camera and recording technology is readily apparent.  This show simply *looks* & *sounds* far better than his previous release and is much better edited as well.  His first solo DVD suffers from an overabundance of cheap and tacky low-budget ""visual effects"", the vast majority of which have been eliminated here, and when they do occasionally pop up they're at least much better looking and viewable.  For the Vai fan, ""Where The Wild Things Are"" is the pinnacle of his craft, his art, and his ability to put on a really fun show!",1266624000,,4523,4.848051948051948

Great music and great playing but I like watching steve and the band move around more from one end of the stage to the other. I like watching guitar tricks and stunts with other members of the band.

His band is superb and really supports the music with great performances all round. The vision is stunning and the sound is even better. The editing is great because it was done by Vai himself - no quick shots and stupid effects to detract from the performance.

Jimi Hendrix are the ones who made me first pick up a guitar and say
""Hell Yeah!--I wanna do that!"" (-:
This amazing 2007 concert, done in Minneapolis is simply brilliant!
Steve's virtuosity as well as his diversity and fluid dexerity
are the stuff of legend!
This man is a true genius in my eyes, and this 2 disc DVD showcases
that fact perfectly!
The better question would be what couldn't Steve Vai play?
He's seen them come and go, he's played behind everybody from
Frank Zappa to David Lee Roth and more and hasn't lost any of his
inventiveness and fire along the way!
From experimental electric forays to brilliant acoustic pieces...
all of them will have you rewinding it again and again and asking yourself
""How Did He Do That?"" or ""Did He Just Do That?""
If you've never had the opportunity to see him live...
this is the next best thing!
Master Steve Vai, I forever bow at your axe altar!! (-:
Guitar players, (or good music lovers) you gotta get this one here!

I really cannot say anything bad about this DVD. Stunning performances, both melodic and fast songs & solos, great melodies and harmonies, tightest bass/drum/rhythm guitar combination I've ever heard - all this is featured on these two DVDs. On top of that you'll have two contrasting violinists blowing you away each in their own way. The sound of the songs has changed drastically compared to the past, not just because of the different instruments used, but also because of Steve's ingenious orchestration edits.

Bonus features will tell you more than you probably want to know about the band's tour experience which will make the obsessed fans happy.

You'll be able to tell that a lot of work has been put into this DVD. There was no weak band member. They've all got it down 100%. I will always treasure this DVD.",1262736000,,947,4.869565217391305

The DVD is amazing and everyone should see this, cause it is produced and edited by Vai and you see what the musicians are doing up close. MUST See",1261699200,,246,4.040816326530612
3892566,5,B002AWJEU8,"Steve's back, but it's as if he was never gone!

Great to see the old stuff, new stuff bundled in the middle and the outstanding growing skills as a perfomer by the genius of the space-age guitar.

Also followed by a great band, introducing other kind of strings to bundle with the guitar, creating a soul-powered live gig, a must see!

Worth every dime!",1260489600,,354,4.5
3892567,4,B002AWJEU8,"I ordered this music dvd along with several others. So far this is the best of bunch. I am a long time musician and sound tech,not a guitar player so I was not expecting to be captured by the depth of this concert. I know of Steve Vai's history and work but,his band is amazing as well. Powerful drumming, two violins with two guitarist, keyboards and bass. The songs are very interesting arrangements that showcase the tremendous talent and technical prowess of these excellent players. Even if you have never heard of Vai, this show pulls you in. Watch the bios first. Then when watching the concert you will enjoy it fully. I have a large collection of music dvds from many diverse artists,This one is in my top 5..",1258156800,2,718,4.530769230769231

8360462,5,B002AWJEU8,This is a DVD to cherish and treasure for a lifetime. Adding the two violins to the band for this tour was a master stroke of EPIC proportion!!!! Steve Vai is simply one of the most accomplished musicians of our time and this recording is as near to perfection as it gets. Ann Marie Calhoun is a national treasure on the violin and one can only hope she will be included on future Steve Vai tours.,1404000000,,397,4.2368421052631575
8360463,5,B002AWJEU8,"The way the violins and Steve's guitar compliment, supplement, and play off of each other is amazing, to say the least. This is another masterful performance by one of the most technologically  advanced guitarist on the planet. I believe weather you like rock guitar or symphonic strings you will enjoy this video. I would be remiss if I failed to mention the other exceptional musicians in Steve's band. Steve's band does an absolutely phenomenal job of capturing the energy and emotion to compliment Steve's amazing guitar performance.",1401494400,,537,5.172413793103448
