I love gory movies, especially since I'm in love with zombie  films.  J.R. Bookwalter outdid himself by making this movie.  Great movie  and lots of gore.

897131,2,6304550839,"I had obsessed over this movie for ages, based on the cover graphic alone.  Every time I saw it, I was determined I would watch it, someday, but just never seemed to get around to it.  I think the image used to advertise brought back old traumatic memories of my first time watching the Savini version of Night of the Living Dead.  I was way too young, perusing late night cable while babysitting at a house in the woods, and I had nightmares for weeks.  So seeing that image of the zombie with the mask brought back the chills of my first encounter with the Living Dead, and I avoided the film, thinking it would scare (scar?) me the same way.  Much older and wiser - or just more jaded - I finally faced my fears.  Wow, was I worried for nothing.  The marketing genius who came up with that advertising image can pay himself on the back for creating the scariest piece of this film.  This is a movie clearly made by amateurs with a love of the genre, and I will gladly give them points for enthusiasm.  Execution, however, leaves much to be desired.  The acting ranges from laughable to painful.  The video quality is subpar.  The makeup and effects are obvious labors of love, but they haven't aged well.  And the script feels like it was written by committee, with awkward dialogue and a subplot that goes nowhere.  Hollywood is so fond of remakes, but they always choose their own big-budget films that don't need remaking.  Here is a film with a solid foundation that only needs a little polish from some professionals.  I would love to see what it would look like with an actual budget and real actors.  A hell of a lot more than I want to see yet another Friday the 13th reboot.",1470009600,4,1686,4.387096774193548

897134,4,6304550839,"This is what you expect from a guy that once worked with George A Romero on Dawn of the Dead, who then goes out and hires a film crew and cast to work on a zombie film he wrote, but they have absolutely not budget and noone gets paid until after the films release. True story,everyone that worked on this film did so on the premise that it would make a profit, how it could it not being shot on super 8 with unknown actors whose characters names parodied known horror icons. It actually turned out to be a truly good effort that has become a silent underground cult classic especially among b movie and romero zombie fans. I especially enjoy the religous who believe the zombie are their servants sent by god to bring punishment and cleansing etc. I find it funny romero used a similar less religious situation in his survival of the dead about 2 decades later.

897317,4,6304550839,I love this movie such a great low-budget zombie flick. Basically zombies have taken over and there are police out there called the Zombie Squad to take them out. Everything about this movie is bad but I love it. I remember going to my local video store every friday night with my friend to rent this and some other horror movie and order some pizza and watch them. Maybe that's why I like it so much because I have memories with it but I think it holds up quite well and a wonderfully cheesey zombie film that every horror fan needs to see and add to their collections while they still can. I've been hearing that this is going out of print soon so I would suggest picking it up while it's very cheap and before the price sky rockets.,1369353600,4,735,4.257142857142857
897318,4,6304550839,"So what do you do if you have about a $10 budget, a few cheap 8mm cameras, and a ton of determination to make a real horror film that can actually pass as a real movie? You do what these folks from Akron Ohio did. First let me say this film is very, very low budget. In fact it's probably the lowest budget movie I have ever seen. Yes the acting is absolutely awful, the script is even worse, the editing sucks too. So you can't judge a film like this on how good it is compared to other real films, because of the reality that there was barely any budget for this movie and no one who worked on it knew what the hell they were doing. They just did it because they had a driving passion to pull it off and believed in what they were doing. For that reason this film has some real merit. But I can't judge it compared to any other films or in the usual ways. Based on that I must say some things about this production really impressed me, particularly much of the camera work which was surprisingly good considering the limitations. Great tracking shots, some excellent pullbacks, and very imaginative angles. Also they did a good job with the lighting during sequences that took place at night. And the gore was amazing considering the next to nothing budget. Sometimes the gore was very well done. Probably the weakest link in the entire film was the acting by the doctor in the baseball hat. I mean the guy was seriously terrible. None of the actors could act worth a damned except Reverend Jones during the sermon scene. His acting was pretty good there for someone who wasn't an actor. But all in all this film is terribly weak compared to almost any real movie. But considering that this film was extremely low budget and shot in 8mm by complete novis's, it's also an amazing accomplishment.",1367884800,,1796,4.396396396396397

897322,2,6304550839,"The Dead Next Door (J. R. Bookwalter, 1989)

J. R. Bookwalter, who gave us the surprisingly fun Ozone back in 1993, got his celluloid start as an extra in George Romero's 1985 flick Day of the Dead. His directorial debut was The Dead Next Door, and like many features produced by those who have been on the fringes of Romero's ride to superstardom, it owes a great deal to Romero. Unlike a lot of other movies that have come out of Romero's camp followers, however, The Dead Next Door is not a derivative, jumbled mess. Bookwalter already had a vision for what he was after that differed from Romero's (as can be seen by more recent work), and so he didn't feel the need to stay tied slavishly to the canon, as did filmmakers like Savini, Hinzmann, and Russo. So while The Dead Next Door still has its ties, it can't be seen as anything but its own film.

Plot's pretty basic: zombies come back from the dead and the military puts together a unit that's supposed to go out and exterminate them. Problem is, since the zombie invasion began, a religious cult has sprung up around the walking dead, and they will do anything they can to stop the government team from achieving its objective.

Yeah, it's basic, and this is a seriously no-budget film, so you have to know what you're getting into here. Don't expect a big Hollywood production with top-notch actors and effects. If, however, you're open to movies that are a lot of fun to watch because the people who were making them had a lot of fun making them, then The Dead Next Door may be right up your alley. You may be better off starting with Oxygen, which Bookwalter made with an even smaller budget (but more experience, so it's a better movie) and then progressing to this, but if you like your cheese with a large slab of dead meat, then you will eventually want to get your mitts on The Dead Next Door. **",1260403200,,1865,4.431486880466473

897326,5,6304550839,"Filmed on a 8mm camera and no budget, dispite it's flaw's, J.R. Bookwalter's Dead Next Door is a highy underrated little zombie gorefest with a somewhat original story. It start's out as your normal zombie pic with horde's of the undead taking over the country (a la Dawn of the Dead), but then put's a spin on the genre by introducing a zombie cult. There is a cult that believes the zombie outbreak is Gods' work and the zombie's were sent by him to purify the nation. They harness the zombie's, feed them, keep them as pet's, and encourage their brain-eating behavior. I think it's a really cool and original premise for a zombie film. It also pay's great homages to the one's before it like Evil Dead and Romero film's, one character is even named Romero King and another character is named Raimi. Of course there is bucket's of gore, tounge's being ripped out, dismemberment, gut munching, decapitation, neck ripping disembowelment, intestine chomping, you know the usual.
Dead Next Door is one of my favorite zombie flick's, sure it's not up to Romero or Raimi caliber, but it does put a fun and original spin on the zombie genre itself. Highly recommended.",1199664000,,1163,4.733990147783251

No, there aren't any computer graphics, super-stars, or grammy-ready show-tunes to be found. However, this movie is an obvious labor of love and a tribute to all things dead and shambling. Made in Akron, Ohio in 1985 on super 8 film (!!) by a bunch of teenagers, this project could have been infinitely worse (check out the Milpitus Monster sometime). Instead, it's quite watchable, w/ a few actual flashes of brilliance! Backed financially by Sam Raimi himself, TDND is enjoyable throughout, never trying to be anything more than 78 minutes of gruesome, blood-squirting entertainment. The whole Jim Jones-like / living dead worshipping cult idea was original in '85. Sure, the acting is stiff and the dialogue hilarious, yet TDND is a good effort by the wide-eyed kids who created it!

897393,1,6304550839,"My SECOND review, as my first did not get printed (AS USUAL).  Anyway, I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I usually try and give credits to directors, producers, writers, and actors in most of my movie reviews; however, I'm going to make an exception here.  I've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd ""hilarious"", ""Night of the Living Dead + money + color"", ""wonderful for gorehounds"", etc., etc., etc.  All I can say is it must not take much to please you people.

This is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, the WORST excuse for a movie I've ever seen.  (My most humble apologies to Tobe Hooper and ""Mortuary"").  The whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning, ""why don't critics take horror movies more seriously?"".  Well, Einstein, here's a glowing example.  This is nothing but grade D trash:  horrible effects, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible directing.  You name it; it's NOT in there.  This movie's most FEEBLE attempts at humor come off as just that:  feeble.  I bought this, together with ""Dead and Breakfast"", and I can't begin to tell you which one is worse.

So, here's a little advice from me:  go check out a book at the library, buy a book, go to a REAL movie, have your hair done, have a manicure--do ANYTHING but waste your time on this gag-fest (for all the WRONG reasons) of a movie.

897475,3,6304550839,"The story's skin and bones, the acting is terrible, and the whole thing is shot with a Super-8mm camera but, bless young J.R. Bookwalter's dark little heart, there's blood and gore at every turn of this low-budget zombie film from 1989 (newly remastered in 2005).  The Dead Next Door really was Bookwalter's brainchild, as he wrote, directed, and appeared in the film - all at the tender age of nineteen.  Of course, this movie would never have been made without the help of Sam Raimi, who helped finance the project and, under the pseudonym ""The Master Cylinder,"" produced it.  The Raimi factor is rather obvious - e.g., you have characters named Raimi, Savini (after Tom Savini), and Carpenter (after John Carpenter); you have some characters watching Evil Dead on television at one point, and you have Bruce Campbell dubbing for a couple of characters.

This time around, the zombie menace originates in Akron, Ohio.  A Dr. Bow (Lester Clark) was trying to bring dead tissue back to life or something, but he sort of goofed up, producing a virus that takes control of dead bodies and sends them out to collect further human flesh for the virus' consumption.  A few years later, zombies are running amuck all over the country.  The newly created Zombie Squad does its best to protect citizens from these cannibalistic undead killers (despite a group of vocal liberals who want to protect zombie rights, apparently believing they can reason with these undead brutes just by sitting down with them over a cup of tea), but the fact that the whole force seemingly consists of less than a dozen people is sort of a handicap.  To make matters worse, their numbers are actually dwindling pretty fast, as several of the good guys aren't too good at paying attention (especially in terms of where they put their hands) whenever zombies pop up.  Cutting to the chase, the Zombie Squad is sent out to Akron in search of Dr. Bow's original zombie formula, as the surly Dr. Moulsson (Bodan Pecic) believes he can use that information to come up with an antidote to the zombie virus.  While there, the squad runs into a religious cult, led by Reverend Jones (Robert Kokai), intent on using zombies for their own nefarious purposes.  That really complicates things for Raimi (Pete Ferry) and his Zombie Squad mates.

The story is enough to hold the movie together, but it hangs several seemingly important sub-plots out to dry.  The acting is just bad all the way around.  This film, as the viewer quickly discovers, is truly all about the blood and gore.  I was a little concerned early on because there was obviously someone just off-camera throwing ""blood"" against the wall whenever zombies attacked, but the special effects improve significantly from that point on.  The best moments come in the form of multiple feeding scenes, wherein we get to watch zombies tear into victims' bodies and just stuff themselves with blood and guts.  I really give the special effects guys a lot of credit (especially since all of those working on the film were essentially volunteers) - not only are the effects well above average for a low-budget film, they include some unnecessary but highly appreciated extra touches - e.g., when a decapitated head manages to bite someone's finger off, we get a shot of the finger oozing out of the head's neck.  It's this kind of dedication that allows a low-budget horror film like this, with its weak plot and terrible acting by one and all to find a nice little niche in the hearts and minds of gorehounds like me.",1155600000,2,3532,4.790774299835255
897476,1,6304550839,"All too often when consumers run across an interesting movie that they have never heard of before, they make the decision to buy or rent it based on the packaging instead of writing down the name of the show and then looking up reviews for it. This approach makes consumers the playthings of unscrupulous marketers. One such company is Anchor Bay Entertainment that this summer released a 1988 flick called ""The Dead Next Door"" on DVD. The packaging for this DVD touted this movie as being a lost horror classic that has now resurfaced. In fact, its labelled a ""Collector's Edition"" and a ""Making Of"" documentary is added to the DVD. Such are the lengths that Anchor Bay has gone to in order to deceive uninformed customers.

The marketing claims are only partly right. The Dead Next Door really is a ""lost"" horror flick that has been out of sight (not even on cable television) since it was originally released in 1988. However, it is not a classic, unless you consider poorly made features to be ""classics"" in their own right. Think of a latter day Ed Wood type production made with even

less talent than found in Ed Wood's movies.

The Dead Next Door was the brainchild of an Akron, Ohio teenager named J.R. Bookwalter who somehow persuaded Hollywood movie maker Sam Raimi to put up the financing for a flick to be shot on Super 8. In gratitude, Bookwalter named the lead role ""Raimi"" and one of the lesser roles ""Dr. Savini"" after Sam Raimi associate Tom Savini. The name of the evil cult leader is named Rev. Jones in honor of the real life Rev. Jim Jones who was responsible for the Jonestown mass suicide in 1978. How original.

The Dead Next Door is a good example of what happens when a teenager with no real movie making experience is given a miniscule budget to make a feature length flick. Abandoned houses, and a high school serve unconvincingly as high tech labs, government offices and as a headquarters for a zombie cult. The plot is completely unimaginative, the acting is just plain awful, and the original actors voices have been clumsily dubbed back in and sound completely wooden. While watching this, you will find yourself frequently looking at your watch even though the flick is only 84 minutes long.

As with the case of so many of today's Shot on Video (SoV) horror flicks, The Dead Next Door comes off looking really cheap and gives the impression of having been just thrown together over the weekend in hopes of cashing in on cool box art, an intriguing title and gullible movie fans. And with good reason since The Dead Next Door was shot in just a few days and comes across as a cheapjack production that was made in haste and with but little talent.

The Dead Next Door is a horror flick that is so bad that it is bad. In both this flick and in subsequent productions, J.R. Bookwalter shows the lack of an eye for detail and total unoriginality that has resulted in his name being mud among knowledgeable horror flick fans.

In any event, The Dead Next Door is a waste of both your time and money no matter how low a price you can  get it for.",1155340800,4,3076,4.52972972972973
897477,5,6304550839,"The Dead Next Door is another fine addition to the Zombie genre.  If you were to place this in terms of acting and film quality, it would have to fall somewhere between Night and Dawn of the dead, but leaning more towards night.  Apparently this film was shot, written, and  produced by a then 18-year-old Bookwalter, which in and of itself is worthy of a viewing.  The plot needs almost no explaining:  zombies walk amongst us, and their legions are growing.  In this film, however, we get organized zombie squads that work out of D.C. and patrol the nearby neighboring states.  Like in The Omega Man, it is implied that science was the cause and could be the cure for the undead problem.  The storyline itself is both irreverent and cynical, full of stupid people doing stupid things.  One of the best parts is when a group of protesters sporting Let The Dead Walk signs gets attacked by the very creatures they were trying to protect.  There are even zombie cults and zombie sacrifices.  Gore-mongers won't be disappointed either:  the special effects, although coming close but not quite equaling such maestros as Romero or Fulci, are still capable of dropping open the jaw.  DVD extras are very formidable:  interviews, deleted scenes, alternate takes, photo galleries and behind the scenes footage, to name but some of the included treasure trove here.  Shot in suburban Ohio, this is a true independent film and deserves to be respected on that merit.",1151452800,,1458,4.82258064516129
897478,4,6304550839,"J.R. Bookwalter's the Dead Next Door was made on an ultra shoe-string budget, and it shows.  However, what Bookwalter accomplished (with a little help from an uncredited Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi) is something to behold when you look at the makeup and gore effects alone, which are reason enough to give this a look and put up with the absolutly horrible acting.  That's forgiveable enough when you consider that Bookwalter and the cast and crew (most of which were his friends and worked for next to nothing or free) are having a blast during the entire film, in which a zombie killing squad gets in over their heads when they infiltrate a cult with a horde of undead flesh eaters in the basement.  The Dead Next Door is a fun zombie romp that's loaded with some memorable scenes, and all these years later it's still better than any recent big budget zombie film (especially the Resident Evil films and the Dawn of the Dead remake).  Anchor Bay has once again assembled a great selection of Special Features for a cult classic on DVD, including a great making of and a commentary by Bookwalter.  For zombie fans, this is definitely worth picking up.",1144800000,5,1147,4.658415841584159
897479,4,6304550839,"I'm always up for a good campy zombie movie, but I guess the charm of this one eluded me. The plot's your standard zombie fare, no frills. The film take place after a widespread zombie outbreak. Some time later, a zombie killing squad is formed. They kill zombies, you see. Then throw in an evil cult who feeds and preserves the zombies, some vacant actors who seem to have a tenuous grasp on the English language, and you have ""Dead Next Door.""

Speaking of acting, the lines were actually dubbed in after the filming. While the main character's voice actor was Bruce Campbell, the rest of the cast was offensively bad. For instance, the stereotypical scientist character collectively recites obscure alchemic jargon while running from zombies near the end, in the same voice you or I would use to read a recipe from a cook book. I bring up the matter of acting first because it's the first issue the viewer will encounter.

The movie's pacing is a bit of a problem. The film starts out with zombies eating people. No buildup or the slightest tension, just zombies running around wreaking havock. Thinking back, I can't really remember a time Dead Next Door tried to actually scare the viewer. Half-way through, it kind of melts into a complacent ""bang bang"" action movie, taking a while to escalate back into any more zombie carnage.

Dead Next Door's characters are virtually nondescript, and the few slight attempts at character development come off as a bit contrived. Regarding the plot, it was intriguing when those activists were protesting poor treatment of the zombies-- Until one of the characters vacantly inquired, ""WHO WOULD ACTUALLY WANT TO SAVE THOSE THINGS?"" GAH. Writers, take note. Never have your characters blatantly say something the viewer is thinking. It can turn a pretentious chin-grab moment into a forehead-slap, believe me. Also, the idea that the zombie-revival medicine the movie references to for so long could turn a zombie into a zombie-human is half-baked and comical. Dead body is revived as a zombie... Zombie is revived as a half-zombie... Huh?

So what do we have left? The zombie effects are above average, considering the budget. Even the puppets don't look half bad. The film's far less gory than I imagined it would be, but there are a couple memorable scenes here and there. A scene involving a zombie's mouth and a grenade, for one. I do appreciate the number of extras, though. Dead Next Door has a few hordes, as opposed to the seven to eight hobos hired in other indies.

So yeah. Dead Next Door kinda shambles along like the zombies it portrays, but it has enough bites for an enthusiast of the obscure sub-genre. Caffeine is recommeded...

Now yes a lot of the budget went into the gore and special effects, but if you are a fan of zombie films, isn't that what you came for in the first place?  The acting isn't top notch and there are a few poorly done moments, but this film is so low budget that they actually work and make it fun to watch.  The film was recorded without audio so people had to then do voiceovers.  Bruce Campbell actually lent his voice as the main character (even though he didn't get credited).  This film has been only available on VHS until now, and it's great to have it on DVD, it's loaded with special features and even has a somewhat pointless music video.  There are a few funny moments like in the beginning when the zombie squad shoves a grenade in a zombie's mouth.  Once again this movie is very low budget and that is one of the things that make it so entertaining to watch.  I myself plan to make a low budget zombie film for my Film Class, and if you're like me, this film will give you the ideas, techniques, and confidence to make your own, that is, if you have the right amount of equipment.  Anyways, the movie is really fun to watch, it has a ""bad"" ending but you really just don't care, and the special effects are great.  Ignore what the naysayers have to say, this film may not be the best in the world but it's definitely entertaining, funny at moments, and impressive for just how ridiculously low budget this thing is.

897483,5,6304550839,"I can't believe I hadn't heard of this film sooner. It's incredible. From what I had heard, I was expecting a decent zombie romp. The back of the box has an incredibly rotten and gory zombie on it, and talks of humor. I opened it up, looked at the disc and the insert and, well, I was a little put off. It looked like it might turn out bad. I hoped for it to be at least Zombi 3 caliber(that is, just a fun ol' zombie film, even if the story's bad, the zombies are wacky, and etc, etc)

I was quite surprised when the movie flat out rocked. The opening sequence is the zombies taking over a town. It was incredible. There were LARGE numbers of extras in this movie playing zombies. We don't just have a handful like most indie zombie flicks. No, we have actual HORDES. HORDES, I SAY.

I was instantly hooked. Next, we have the Zombie Squad, a policing agency set up to deal with the zombies. They instantly reminded me of MFP from Mad Max, so I was really digging that connection.

Then the story. The story is great and paced very well. The acting is better than I was expecting it to be.

So, if you like zombies, get it. Now. HORDES. ZOMBIE. HORDES. And a great story. There's gore, too. Nothing anywhere near those crazy Italians or Peter Jackson, but there is still gore when gore is needed. I was very happy with this.",1131753600,3,1324,4.242063492063492

The zombies are well done in an underground film sort of way, especially the animatronic ones.  Best of all, Bruce ""Evil Dead"" Campbell supplied the voice-over talent of the lead hero (at least in the original dvd release).

Now let me say one thing b4 I get started ,dont, I repeat do not expect some great plot, cause there isnt, this is also a very low budget flick shot on an awesome 8MM film, well awesome as it works with this film. There is a plot but it doesnt get into much detail. This film only runs 70 minutes long.

This movie rely's on basically large amounts of violence, Gore, tons of Zombies,lots of blood, and plenty of Zombies feasting on humans. And for that this film is awesome. Eery Zombie film fanatic will like this, as not many low budget Zombie flicks rely on plot more or less violence, well in some cases.

The make-up on the zombies happens to be very well done, the acting is ok shockingly not as bad as I would have thought.

Bsically I brought this with never see'ing it and , it was a given to basically have. I brought it and was quit surprised. The element that I love is that there are Zombies constantly and plenty of Zombies and Zombie violence,true Zombie flick and classic at that. So for all you Zombie fans out there who never seen this get it, it is a must for any hardcore Zombie collector to have and being that I have just about 40-50 Zombie flicks I have seen them from huge budgets ( Land of the Dead ) to mediocre budgets ( Shaun of the Dead,Dawn of the Dead 1978,Zombi)low budget it ones like ( Dead Meat, Stink of flesh, Dead next Door). So I can  appreciate all types of Zombie flicks and this one is one to love just because of the large amounts of Zombies and like I said Zombie violence this is just a pure Zombie horror. Some other movies I have are ....

1985 Day of the Dead, Zombie Holocaust, Burial Ground, Hell of the Lving Dead, Zombi 2, 2004 Dawn of the Dead,Re-animator,Beyond Re-animator, Return of the Living Dead 1&2, City of the living Dead, Dead Alive etc....

I could go on and on butI have seen them all, and the Dead Next Door is a must to have it it by far is way more violent than any of Romeros flicks and waymore violent than any of Fulcis, this is movie is justone being splatter fest of Zombies getting killed and doing the killing, a must cant go wrong with this .

There are four reasons why you should want to see this movie. (1) It is one of the very few Super 8mm feature films that actually got a release. (2) Sam Raimi, the director of Spiderman and the Evil Dead funded it [not-credited]. (3) You are a filmmaker who wants to see an extremely low-budget horror film (4)The gore.
Basically it has all the hallmarks of an Evil Dead / George A. Romero film fan wanting to make a similar ""Foot-in-the-Hollywood-door"" type feature and it shows. The story is your average run-of-the-mill ""zombies take over the earth"" type horror movie. A tactical force sponsored by the government called ""The Zombie Squad"" must go find a serum that will stop the zombies. Along the way there is plenty of gore and body parts before they stumble on a cult that wants to control the zombies so that it can rule the world.
It is really not that bad considering the budget limitations but at the same time it is extremely cheesy. J.R.Brookwater still makes films but unlike Sam Raimi or George A. Romero is still pretty much a nobody. Most low-budget horror filmmakers go on to become a somebody but apart from the very rare odd few scenes, Brookwater lacks an eye for detail and originality which is why this movie never really did take off.
Only for low budget horror fans, filmmakers or zombie movie completists.

In the film, an epidemic has  caused a worldwide outbreak of the living dead. The government has enlisted  a team of gun-toting mercenaries known as The Zombie Squad to protect the  living and destroy the dead. But there's also a strange cult bent on  protecting the zombies at any cost (zombies have rights, too, you know!).  One of the Zombie Squad guys, Mercer, gets infected with the zombie virus  and it's up to his loyal buddies to find a cure before it's too late. Of  course that pesky pro-zombie cult gets in the way, so it won't be easy.
I'm a huge Dawn of the Dead freak -- it's my favorite horror film of all  time. So while watching The Dead Next Door, I had to remind myself that you  can't expect every zombie film to be on par with Romero's work. You just  can't. And if you can overlook the cardboard characters, uneven acting, and  some of the none-to-subtle inside jokes (characters named Raimi, Romero,  Savini, and so on), I'm sure zombie fans will find a lot to admire here.
First off, the zombies look great. The makeup effects people really had  a field day with The Dead Next Door, and they deserve kudos for their  stunning work. There's some splendidly gruesome imagery here, including an  encounter with a farmhouse zombie that I won't soon forget. Just a note: If  you ever have to pick up something that happens to be near a dismembered  zombie head, please watch your fingers, okay?
Gorehounds should  definitely be satisfied, but luckily this film has an intriguing (if  somewhat familiar) premise to back up all the carnage. It's also  well-directed and photographed -- though the grainy Super-8mm image can be  too dark at times. It's not as potent as it could be, and it tends to drag  in places, but any self-respecting zombie fan should seek this one out.  And, hey, the ending was pretty darn cool. For all that was accomplished on  such a low budget, it's pretty impressive.
ONE LAST THING: The Dead Next  Door was produced during 1985-1989, and ""master cylinder"" Sam  Raimi helped finance the film. Raimi's Evil Dead even plays on a TV in the  background of one scene.  And, well, our good friend Bruce Campbell  supplied the voice-overs for two of the characters in The Dead Next Door. I  knew that Raimi character sounded like Ash!",961286400,11,2528,4.6643990929705215
897645,5,6304550839,"I laughed, I cried, and in the end, I learned a little bit more about myself.  The Dead Next Door is a heartwarming tale of a boy and his dog.  In this case, the boy is Zombie Patrol 205 and the dog is everything else.  The movie seems to revolve around a yellow hat which has taken control of a  scientist's mind, driving him insane with lust and power.  A motley crew of  zombie hunting mercenaries are at the mercy of the yellow hat's whims and  fancies.  The movie reached its climax eight minutes in when the  unfortunate zombie hunters sat back and enjoyed watching Evil Dead in the  lounge.  Cult icon, Bruce Campbell, is involved in the sound for some  reason, yet makes no appearance in the movie causing most viewers  spontaneous hives.  The movie took an unfortunate downward spiral when the  bastardized human zombie cop stole the maniacal yellow hat, but did not put  it on his head.  The movie has a stellar sing-a-long soundtrack rivaled  only by The Little Mermaid and The Sound of Music.  The random dubbed  insertion of ""Damn it"" seemed nothing more than a flimsy ploy to  distract viewers from what is nothing short of a Shakespearean script.  My  personal favorite part of the movie was when Terri screamed at the sight of  a sudden onslaught of zombies.  I have one major criticism with this film  other than the fact that Zombie Patrol 205's cumulative IQ is less than  205, and that is ZOMBIES CAN'T RUN!  Everyone knows this and the sight of  running zombies seemed more like a dream sequence than reality.  Kudos to  the set designers for a magnificent pine zombie cage.  Why the ingenious  alien yellow hat would order its minion scientist to hide in this flimsy  cage is beyond me.  Still it made for bone-tingling thrills watching the  bastardized zombie cop threaten to eat the yellow hat symbiotic slave's  tongue.

7873942,3,6304550839,"The Dead Next Door,"" an independent horror film, was made by 19-year-old J.R. Bookwalter in 1989. Shot in the Super-8 format, the film features an elite team of soldiers whose job is to battle and contain hoards of zombies and the secretive cult dedicated to protecting them. The film took four years to complete, and enlisted the cooperation of more than 1,500 Ohio residents, who portrayed the multitude of blood-hungry undead.

Director Bookwalter drew upon many horror films, especially George A. Romeros Night of the Living Dead and assorted slasher films of the 1980s. The movie incorporates as much blood and gore as possible while keeping the tone light and irreverent. Made for around $125,000, the film is on a par with horror flicks with a much larger budget. In homage to horror icons, both real and fictional, characters are given names such as Commander Carpenter, Dr. Savini, Raimi, and Jason.

Pace is brisk and never lets up, though actions are sometimes not clearly motivated, but theres definitely passion in the project. This is a labor of love and a not-bad horror film. It sure is a lot of fun

Bookwalter; Restoration of the Dead featurette; the Nightlight Screening Q & A; behind-the-scenes footage; deleted scenes and outtakes; storyboard gallery; production stills gallery; Akron location tour; auditions; music video; and DVD trailers.",1506470400,,1474,5.184873949579832

FILM REVIEW

The first time I was introduced to The Dead Next Door I was aware that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell had some involvement in it, so I checked it out. This was years ago, so the transfer I watched was pretty rough looking, but I did enjoy it. Jump ahead many years, and Ive now had the chance to check it out on Blu-ray from Tempe Digital and MVD.

The Dead Next Door wears its low budget cheese on its sleeve, never taking itself seriously. There are moments where the special effects in the film skip between absolute brilliance and utter hilarity. The film doesnt shy away from showing the gore, and the zombies all look pretty varied.

The movie has numerous issues for sure, be the terrible acting, the hokey story and a few bits of story dragging, but more often than not, the film goes for broke and just wants to have some fun.

If you haven't seen this looked over zombie gem from 1989, now is the time to do it.

VIOLENCE

The film doesnt pull punches with the gore, but some special effects do look a bit fake. However, other times it can be quite graphic and invoke a George Romero vibe with the ripping open of victims. It isn't any zombie fans hasn't seen before, save for the rat eating zombie, but it certainly is much welcome.

SEX/NUDITY

The film focuses on zombie mayhem and skips the sex and violence. Nothing to see here.

INTERESTING ELEMENTS

-Rat eating zombie is having some problems
-The zombies climbing the fence at the White House. Yep, that aint happening nowadays.
-Seeing people going about their day while the crew films zombies walking around.

BLU-RAY REVIEW

VIDEO

The movie has definitely been improved when it comes to the looks department. Along with the Blu offering up improved video, we also get two audio options, the original dubbed version with Bruce Campbell voicing the main character named Raimi (get it?) and the original cast version, which is a bit on the muddled side. The film does still look pretty rough around the edges, with some scratches and dirt present, but compared to the original DVD release from Anchor Bay, the film has had all sorts of cleanup work performed, and it does show.

The Blu-ray also offers two viewing options, with the film being presented in the original 4:3 matted format and the 16:9 wide format. Purists will love the matte version, and the people that just want their tv screen to be filled will love the 16:9 version. Either way, you cant go wrong.

AUDIO

As I mentioned above, you have two audio options to choose from on the Blu-ray. The classic dubbed is the better sounding of the two, but it does sound more natural with the original audio from the cast members. I haven't even mentioned the fact that on the DVD you have stereo and 5.1 options, along with the original VHS cut of the film. Variety is the spice of life when it comes to the Collectors Edition of The Dead Next Door.

EXTRA FEATURES

The two discs are filled up with special features. The highlight for me was the technical discussion with director J.R. Bookwalter. He goes through the history of getting the film made and the transfer work that was involved with all the various releases. You also have screening Q&A features to watch, storyboards, galleries, trailers and this is only the Blu-ray. The DVD also includes its features, with new interviews and featurettes. Youll be awhile going through all the features.

Its nice to see a low budget movie get such a fantastic treatment and The Dead Next Door rightfully deserves it, as its an often cheesy, but fun zombie flick worth watching over and over again.",1504828800,,5377,4.831154684095861
7873944,2,6304550839,"Dead Next Door is an ultra low budget, home video level, zombie flick. We follow the various misadventures of the ""zombie squad"", an elite group of zombie exterminators. I picked this up years ago hoping it would be a low budget gem, like Nail Gun Massacre was for me, but sadly a lot of the humor and references (too way better films) fell flat. The forced references, had me rolling my eyes for most of the movie. The one positive I can say is some off the effects, while total crap, are kinda fun to watch. Anchor Bay DVD looks fine, and has a good amount of extras. Also, it looks like there is a Blu Ray release on the way in September 2017.

I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone really. I really wanted to like, but this is my second time viewing Dead Next Door and just isn't working for me.",1504396800,,804,4.254901960784314
