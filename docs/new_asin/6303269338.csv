7843343,5,6303269338,"My son has loved this video for years. He wants to be a conductor when he grows up, so he is fascinated by this delightful autobiography of Claudio Abbado, one of the greatest conductors alive today.
The video is in three parts (the first two animated, the third live). The first part is the true story of Claudio's childhood in a family of musicians in Milan before, during and after World War II. The second is his dream, inspired by his mother's stories, in which tiny musicians emerge from a gramophone and have a night of adventures and daring. The third portion is the grown-up Claudio conducting a youth symphony and projecting his passion for music and young people.
The story travels at a lazy pace, which may not satisfy the Nintendo generation. But if you have a child who loves music or who aspires to be a musician, this is a great addition to your video library. Be prepared to explain why the beautiful La Scala concert hall was bombed, why the Gestapo would question a young boy, etc. (there is absolutely no violence shown). The simple animation is beautifully creative and the music is heaven!",984700800,8,1111,4.644670050761421
