6065041,1,B00G7QPTR0,"I haven't even seen the video, and I can't stand her. Out of all the music documentaries issued on Amazon Prime, this no-talent, make-my-ears-bleed  diva has three or four while actual song writing geniuses like The Eagles, Doobie Brothers and Steely Dan have only one. Can you say lots 'o money to feed a jumbo-jet size ego??? Just confirms that the music business has changed for the worse. Way worse. It's all about big booty and the big-buck productions to support and promote hacks. Doesn't hurt that she has a husband who basically owns that side of the business. How can you even begin to compare her to real artists who actually come up with their own original material, arrangements, and who can play several instruments? It's pathetic to think she holds a candle...",1465344000,,775,4.7835820895522385

6065104,2,B00G7QPTR0,"This is really an uncoordinated superficial jungle of spaghetti which tries too hard in vain to show the 'human' side of Beyonc. She is the star, executive producer, narrator, co-writer and co-director of this film, which pretty much tells you what the real purpose of this ""documentary"" is. Had she gone into her upbringing, childhood and family more, it could have been interesting. Really just a vain attempt to seem down to earth.",1419811200,4,434,4.958904109589041

6065143,5,B00G7QPTR0,"This Documentary is AMAZING! Beyonce really lets us into her life and shows us what life is really like in the spotlight.
I applaud Beyonce, she really opened up and got personal; something she rarely ever does.
The always-private Beyonce shows us the struggles of being an established artist, the difficulties of being a woman in a male-dominated world, and most of: that she is HUMAN!
She shows us that she isn't perfect, that she has her off days, too.
To all Beyonce fans (& Stans; I see you BeyHive!) This is a MUST!
If you aren't a fan, I would still recommend it, since it is a great documentary that is moving & inspiring!
Not only is the Documentary Great, but this DVD also includes a bonus disc that includes her concert at Revel, which she peformed 5 months after giving birth to her daughter, Blue Ivy!
The DVD & Case came on time & in great condition.",1399766400,,865,4.446540880503145

6065146,5,B00G7QPTR0,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my sister. It arrived on Christmas eve and since we usually open one gift I recommended she open this gift.

6065162,1,B00G7QPTR0,"I especially bought this one for the concert. I returned the item immediately after watching the concert on my plasma. Half of the screen is black because of the absurd widescreen size of about 3.30. The decision to release the concert in this aspect ratio was obviously made by people not thinking (about the people watching this on their tv). What a stupidity! The show itself is OK, but - in this case - that's not enough.",1390694400,3,425,4.532467532467533
6065163,3,B00G7QPTR0,"I already had saw this on HBO, so I had to buy because of the Concert. I got tired of seeing bits and pieces. It was nice Good Job Beyonce. I only wish she would've done her Interview with Oprah or something, but I guess she had to do it with someone who wouldn't out shine her I guess!",1390608000,2,286,3.864406779661017
6065164,5,B00G7QPTR0,"I watched the DVD with my sisters expecting to watch a live concert and be in her concert without being there (if you know what I mean), but it was more of a documentary than a concert. I still loved it though and it was interesting to learn more about Beyonce and the music of course is good.",1390435200,,293,4.068965517241379

Thank you so much Amazon!
I hope you keep working this good,

6065166,5,B00G7QPTR0,"This DVD was amazing! I loved peeking into her super glamorous, yet stressful life. I appreciated the message that she is still just a regular person. People forget that and put celebrities on these crazy pedestals and expect them to meet standards that no one is capable of meeting. Props to Beyonce for being as perfect as it gets.",1390089600,,333,4.661016949152542

6065179,5,B00G7QPTR0,"This was certainly for the fans. For one who loves music she truly delivers. To have been a fan from the beginning and have watched her grow... she is an extraordinary woman. I admire that she never settles. Challenges what seems impossible. Reaching for what seems unreachable. Dares to be different. This woman has successfully accomplished being set as her own category, not being able to be compared to any other artist. After watching this, can't help but to lover and respect her even more.",1389830400,,496,4.847058823529411
6065180,5,B00G7QPTR0,this cd is on repeat in my home. my daughter is a huge beyonce fan and i got great mommy points for this purchase even though she already bought the itunes version.,1389571200,,164,4.15625

6065182,5,B00G7QPTR0,So glad to have this added to my ever so growing collection of concert DVD's that I have of her.,1389312000,,96,3.85
6065183,4,B00G7QPTR0,"This was a pretty good video. Beyonce showed somethings I was a little surpised at. She spoke a little about her father and the relationship they now have. She showed some scenes like one of her back stage hands cussing out some of the dancers. It didn't bother me, but not the image she portrays of herself and the people she surrounds herself with. Hey, we are all human, right? If you were expecting Blue to be on this video a lot, well you will be disappointed. Blue is on here briefly in a few scenes. Also, I know there is a debate on whether she was ever pregnant. Some say she had a surrogate. Others claim this DVD proves she was pregnant. Now, it really doesn't You see a brief scene of where Bey is naked, and it shows a side view of her belly. Honestly, you can never see the face and it could be anyone standing there in a Bey wig. It proves nothing. Over all, I like the DVD and I liked it more than the ""I AM"" DVD only because this was more of her and her life behind the scenes, where as I AM was pretty much her performaces from that tour. There is a second DVD included which is her performances in Atlantic City last year. I haven't watched that one yet, but plan to this weekend.

Also, I did enjoy interviewing part of this DVD. Bey was in comfy clothes, barefoot, hair in a bun and no makeup. You rarely see this side of her. I personally enjoy her looking more natural and in real clothes.",1389225600,,1412,4.153284671532846

6065229,5,B00G7QPTR0,"I originally bought this DVD not because of the documentary, but because of the Live at Revel footage. I had attended the concert in May 2012 and wanted footage for myself. I wish that all of the concert was included in this DVD, but then again it is not a concert DVD! I loved the documentary because it showed anther side of Bey! Plus, the bonus song is great!

6065233,4,B00G7QPTR0,one of her best concerts visually and vocally. this woman truly gets better with time. we are definitely watching a living legend. i rated this 4 out of 5 because she did to much editing which left out some great performances.,1387670400,,226,4.536585365853658

Beyonce is so real and honest in her account of her life, and also the boundaries she has

6065260,5,B00G7QPTR0,One of the Best Beyonc confessionals of all time. She reveilles herself is such a classy but intimate way. Thank you for showing the rest of us that we are just like you. We are venerable at times and superwomen when needed. Thanks B you truly made your mark on the new age trendy classy woman. Cheers to that.,1386633600,5,310,4.271186440677966
6065261,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Great music, great performances.  You're getting 1000 percent when Beyonce steps on that stage.  No half-stepping, coasting along in a daze just to get your money but not caring what she delivers.  If you're not lucky enough to witness this in person, the dvd is definitely the next best thing!  I'm patiently awaiting the Mrs. Carter Show World Tour dvd release so I can purchase that as well.",1386460800,3,394,4.75
6065262,1,B00G7QPTR0,The movie was ok But I was very upset with the live in Atlantic City dvd. It was not the whole concert in fact they edited out half of the show and water down a lot of the songs . What is the point of showing a concert if you are not going to show the whole thing,1386460800,2,263,3.5517241379310347
6065263,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Being fans of Beyonce, my sister and I enjoyed this inside look into her work ethic and performances. She works hard. This doc is interesting even if you are not a fan. It's sophisticated and fun. Bonus song AND concert dvd of an amazing well put together show.",1386201600,4,261,4.458333333333333
6065264,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Have subtitles in Portuguese? I need this DVD, but wanted to know if he's subtitle, is urgent. Thank you :)",1385942400,,107,4.4
6065265,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Beyonce is the greatest to me! She and her band, dancers, and lil mamas are so full of energy. She puts her heart and soul into all of her shows! With a Beyonce concert dvd you can enjoy an amazing concert experience in the comforts of home!",1385856000,3,241,4.148936170212766
6065266,5,B00G7QPTR0,"the package says that I comes with a free download of the song ""God Made You Beautiful"" but I see no website address or access code... anyone know how to download it?",1385683200,,166,4.21875
6065267,5,B00G7QPTR0,I loved the HBO documentary. I can't wait to get the Revel concert as a bonus. Beyonce is simply the best.,1385596800,,106,4.095238095238095
6065298,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Hands down the best performer in the entertainment industry right now! It still baffles me that this concert came only months after she gave birth to her daughter and gave more of a show and entertainment than any of the other pop performers out right now but then again this is Beyonc&eacute; we're talking about.  I was one of the unfortunate fans that wasn't able to view this concert live but this DVD more than makes up for it (along with the fact that she's currently on a world wide tour ;) The only thing I wish she would've done differently was keep some of the songs she took out.  I know the DVD can only be but so long but Revel had some true gems and moments that were sadly cut out.  LIBAD was a great documentary, people can complain all they want but I've never been one to want to dig into others personal lives and I've accepted the fact that Bey is super private so I thought it was amazing that she allowed her fans too see such a vulnerable and intimate side of her, her DVDs are always highly anticipated by me",1385337600,2,1032,4.255102040816326
6065299,5,B00G7QPTR0,"Beyonc is undoubtedly one of the most guarded celebrities I've ever encountered. However, I appreciate 'Life Is But a Dream' because she finally opens up and reveals the personal facet of her life you don't see often.

From being a world-class entertainer to a daughter, mother, and wife, Beyonc's life is like a fairy tale on the surface. The documentary is a compelling story that shows that her ascent to the top wasn't as easy as it seems, and took a lot of hard work.

The singer tells her story in her own words, carefully addressing rumors, sharing her intimate thoughts, and reminding you that she's human. Love her or hate her, Beyonc has indeed left her mark on the world.",1385337600,3,682,4.628099173553719
6065300,4,B00G7QPTR0,"I thought the documentary was very insightful and allowed you to see a lot of what the public doesn't see when she is on stage in her zone.  It was beautifully filmed, executed, and edited.  It was pure and honest.  If you're not a believer of this woman's dedication and soul, then I pity you if this didn't change your mind!

I think the concert was an added bonus, but I was a little disappointed with the editing being as I saw this live and it was amazing (and quite frankly better than it's parred down reincarnation, The Mrs. Carter Show).  For one, it's a very scaled down version of the show, which clocked in at nearly if not slightly over two hours.  Several songs from the second half of the show are omitted like ""I Miss You,"" ""Resentment,"" the Goo Goo Dolls ""Iris"" cover, ""If I Was a Boy,"" the Lauryn Hill ""Ex-Factor"" cover, ""Countdown,"" ""Irreplaceable,"" ""Jumpin' Jumpin',"" and ""Why Don't You Love Me.""  Two, I preferred the show without the editing.  ""Love On Top,"" came after ""End of Time"" but is played at the end during the credits.  ""Countdown"" was a stand-out performance from the show and only the intro was shown here.  ""Run the World (Girls)"" was also edited with the solo dancer intro shown first though it was performed at the end.

Besides that, a great 2-for-1 bundle for any fan of Beyonce!",1385337600,29,1318,4.518987341772152
6065301,5,B00G7QPTR0,This clearly proves how hard Beyonc works. She deserves all the success in the world and then some. The Revel show was amazing.,1385337600,3,127,4.565217391304348

8621285,5,B00G7QPTR0,Great DVD with some live concert footage as well as a good documentary on Beyonc and her family. Very enjoyable.,1505174400,,112,4.65
8621286,2,B00G7QPTR0,"There is no doubt that Beyonce is a hard working woman.  But it is clear that the facade she presents is an accumulation of several artists and writers that work even harder.  This documentary allowed us to see Beyonce, still on her terms.  I have never seen an actual interview with her before - clearly for good reason.  When someone is private as she is (which is fine) she seems more mysterious.  This documentary exposes her.  She doesn't seem at all bright or like the feminist deity that her people work so hard to hold her up as.  Just a normal person...with a silly laptop...filming herself.",1499990400,,600,4.60377358490566
