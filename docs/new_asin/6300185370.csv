220987,5,6300185370,"This wonderful twofer from Universal bundles together two of Rock Hudson's best 60s comedies, MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? and STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.
MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? recounts the adventures of angling 'expert' Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) who is invited to take part in a prestigious fishing tournament.  However, Roger can't even throw a line, let alone catch a fish!  When press agent Abigail Page (the delightful Paula Prentiss) finds out about Roger's problem, she decides to give him the ultimate crash course in fishing...
The film features a delightful musical score by Henry Mancini as well as fine supporting performances from Maria Perschy and Charlene Holt.  The DVD includes the trailer.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS pairs Rock Hudson with sex-bomb Gina Lollobrigida (they also starred together in COME SEPTEMBER).  Hudson plays Carter Harrison, a womanising company exec who marries Antonia (Lollobrigida), an Italian spitfire who is heavily into art and politics.  When their marriage fails, Carter doesn't hear from Tony for many years, until his boss decides the Carter will get a promotion if he can prove that he is a respectable (and, more to the point, MARRIED) man.  He decides to lead Tony on to get the promotion but finds himself falling in love with her all over again.  The memorable supporting cast includes Terry-Thomas, Nancy Kulp, Gig Young, Arthur Haynes and Edward Judd.  The DVD includes the trailer.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).
This release is part of a new wave of classic releases from Universal.  Also look out for ""Send Me No Flowers"", ""A Countess from Hong Kong"", ""The Thrill of It All!"" and ""Pillow Talk"" (sold separately).",1052352000,12,1693,5.303370786516854
220988,4,6300185370,"Two packs are great. As long as you like both movies enough to buy them. That's not the case with this two pack of Rock Hudson movies, but at such a sweet price, it's hard to complain. Of these two films, Strange Bedfellows seems the weakest although, Gig Young makes the movie worthwile and Rock Hudson's character is likeable. The plot is a bit convoluted. It's basically an Opposites Attract film. This time the opposite lies in political opinions. The two charactes meet in Paris and within hours are married. Only after they marry to they realize their extreme differences and decide (somewhat loudly and violently) to call it quits. Seven years pass and Rock Hudson is a successful businessman who is looking for a promotion. However, he is told that he needs to clean up his image long enough to handle the press during the transition. The solution is to try to patch things up with his ex until his promotion is solid. Of course, sparks fly when they meet again and the ending is predictable. What is unclear, outside of the physical, is his attraction to Gina Lollabrigida. Other than being incredibly beautiful, her character's charm is not always evident. Instead of making her an intelligent activist - she's a wacky one who unfortunately does wacky things and gets involved in over the top protests and advocacy. This plays into the ""climax"" of the film. I found myself feeling sorry for Hudson and what he has to bear with this woman. Granted, his character isn't perfect either, but certainly more sympathetic. Some of the best scenes involve the Paris cab service and Hudson's efforts to communicate with Lollabrigida in another cab.
Man's Favorite Sport was a delightful summer romance. Being a fisherman(woman) myself, I found the fishing scenes to be particularly hilarious - especially those involving hip waders. Paula Prentiss is adorable and a very different match for Rock Hudson. She steals every scene she's in. Rock Hudson is truly the most sympathetic character he's ever played in a comedy. He is the top fishing gear salesman at Abercrombie and Fitch. So successful, in fact, that he's written a book on the subject that amateurs use faithfully. The problem is that he's never been fishing in his life - in fact, he hates fish. So when his boss tells him he has to represent the company at a fishing tournament, he's horrified. Paula Prentiss is the Public Relations worker who sets the tournament up. When she learns he's a fraud, she's more concerned about the success of the tournament, so she forces him to take part anyway. Her solution - teach him how to fish in three days. This is where things get really funny. In the meantime, her attraction to him is growing and he wants to kill her. The ending again, is predictable - but enjoy the journey. I always liked Paula Prentiss and wish she had done more movies like this. She was great in Where the Boys Are. Granted, this isn't a Doris and Rock movie, but it is good enough to make you forget about Doris and just enjoy Paula. The other players do an equally good job at rounding things out, especially the fellow tournament entrants.
Strange Bedfellows is not that great - but it's also not that bad. Man's Favorite Sport is pure cotton candy. So the combination and the price of these two films is worth it.",1047427200,17,3297,4.715771230502599

220991,3,6300185370,"Hawks ""cannibalizes"" (his own term) several of the routines from his earlier ""Bringing Up Baby"" in this amusing comedy.  Hudson, while lacking the light touch of Cary Grant, gives an entirely serviceable performance.  The true wonder of the film is Paula Prentiss, who brings a daffy, natural charm to the Katherine Hepburn role.  The film is also bouyed by the comic performances of veterans like John McGiver, Roscoe Karns and Norman Alden (hilarious as Chief John Screaming Eagle).",1011571200,4,484,5.17948717948718
220992,5,6300185370,"The movie is a civilized commedy with no overacting.  All the funny situations are natural and as such believable.  The outdoor scenary is marvellous.

220993,5,6300185370,"One of Howard Hawks' wonderful slapstick feel-good comedies, ""Man's Favorite Sport?"" is a great show that can be enjoyed by everyone... especially ""expert"" fishermen.
Rock Hudson is Roger Willoughby, a renowned fishing expert, who, unbeknownst to his friends, co-workers, or boss, has never cast a line in his life. One day, he crosses paths with Abigail Paige (Paula Prentiss), a sweetly annoying girl who has just badgered his boss into signing Roger up for an annual fishing tournament. Panicked, Hudson confesses his, uh, inadequate experience to the ever-resourceful Abigail. Abby decides to take Roger up to Lake Waccapugi where the tournament will take place and get him broken in. Along the way, Roger learns other things: how to start a motor boat without falling into a lake, how to hold a fish without cringing, and how to discover the girl of his life... with her driving him absolutely crazy!
An excellent supporting cast, a brilliant screenplay, and marvelous cinematography make ""Man's Favorite Sport?"" a great laugh-out-loud comedy for the whole family.",972604800,35,1069,5.257309941520468
220994,5,6300185370,Rock Hudson and Paula Prentice give a great performance in this truly funny film. The various sight gags and situations that Rock Hudson gets into make this really an enjoyable adventure. The fact that he is an expert  and never has fished in his life adds to the situation when he enters a  fishing contest and somehow catches numerous fish but not with a fishing  pole. The tension between Paula and Rock add to the action and supporting  cast does a marvelous job as well. A true sleeper that will have you  rolling in your chair.,963273600,6,533,4.510416666666667

221101,1,6300185370,"I regret that I wasted $6.39 and two hours of my life on this.

While there are a multitude of reasons to dislike this film, Ill keep it down to just a few, and Ill trust that you already know the plot.

First, -most- of the outdoor scenes were shot in a studio, and few of the interiors looks real. Everything screamed stage set. To make matters worse the lighting in every scene was too bright and flat looking. It looked like a cheap TV sitcom, not a theatrically released movie.

Two hours is way too long for this kind of film. It could have easily been edited down to ninety minutes, or preferably not made at all. Much of that wasted time is spent lingering on stupid set pieces. Rock battles with some dingbat over a parking space, Rock has trouble pitching a tent (ha-ha?), Rock tries to take his boat off the top of the car and stumbles around with his feet in two buckets, Rock cant drive a moped and hits a man in a bear suit and the man in a bear suit ends up driving off on the moped. And they drag on and on.

Paula Prentiss is irritating. There is absolutely -nothing- to like about her character. She doesnt come across as a wacky, free-spirited, and fun individual like I assume was intended; shes more like a self-centered, b*tchy, and demanding airhead.

The ending is stupid and predictable, and made even more stupid by the inclusion of 4th wall breaking faux black-and-white movie clip.

I bought this because I loved the Rock Hudson / Doris Day flicks and thought this would be in the same vein  but it's absolutely inferior in every way, shape, and form. I don't know where all these positive reviews are coming from. Perhaps the Russians are meddling in our movie rating systems now? Who knows?

TL/DR? Dont waste your time or money.",1513382400,,1759,4.424148606811145

Howard Hawks directed. As is Hawks' signature this movie is a little chatty like ""Bringing up Baby"" and ""Monkey Business""

Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) is found in several precarious positions by his fiance. At one time he has his tie caught in Easy Muller's (Maria Perschy) zipper. In addition to this Abigail (Paula Prentiss) is spotted coming from his bedroom in her night attire.

221468,5,6300185370,"Nobody seems to understand this movie.

Howard Hawks's screwball comedy starring Rock Hudson as a supposed professional expert on sports fishing who actually knows nothing about it, and Paula Prentiss as the woman who helps him get through a fishing contest despite his ignorance, is perhaps the most amazing cinematic study in symbolic sex I can think of, though the symbolism is so naturally integrated into the action that the censors can't touch it.

Almost every scene involves a woman or women getting a man (Rock Hudson) into something he can't get out of.

It begins with Hudson inserting himself into Prentiss's car and almost not getting out of it, incidentally dropping his ID into the car next to her ID (!), and it turns out she's also gotten him into getting a ticket, which he can't get out of.

Then he finds she's gotten him into entering the fishing tournament, which he can't get out of.

Later she makes him fall into the lake, which he can't get out of, and then she tells him to inflate the gaiters, which he does but they inflate up too much (!) and he can't get out of them.

And she puts his arm into a cast which he can't get out of, so he has to walk around with his arm sticking stiffly up (!) until she finally cuts off the cast (yes, there's a lot of castration imagery too.)

And she causes him to sleep on the couch in a sleeping bag, which he subsequently can't get out of, causing him to get in trouble with his fiancee Tex, which he can't get out of.

These are only a few of the more memorable scenes of ""female traps male,"" which are all symbolic of male ambivalence towards the sex act: desire to consummate and dread of being consumed.

I haven't even mentioned the male sexual imagery associated with fish, but if you watch the film with that in mind, you'll see it everywhere. Just one example is the fishing contest, in which men are judged by the size of their ""trophies"": ""Mine is bigger than yours: I'm the better man!""

And there's some fascinating symbolism in the early scenes in the Abercrombie and Fitch offices, where Hudson and the other men are positioned in front of the various antlered hunting trophies on the walls in such a way that they seem to have horns themselves, foreshadowing, I think, the motif of women manipulating men through male ""animal impulses.""

(I probably can't even explain the symbolism of Hudson getting his tie caught in the zipper of another woman's dress and then being led all around by it without getting this review censored.)

About now many reading this are saying, This is a joke, right? and are preparing to post mocking replies saying ""Yeah, sure, and I suppose all those fishing rods are also sex symbols ..."" (Well, yes, actually.) My only defense is to remind everyone that Hawks was one of cinema's supreme geniuses: not even Hitchcock makes his sexual symbolism (which is universally agreed to be there) so natural and unobtrusive. The ultimate test will be to watch the movie again with some of these things in mind: even if you're skeptical now, I bet you won't be able to help feeling there's something to this. Meanwhile, feel free to post your scorn.

(And I'm not saying everything in this movie is a sexual symbol. Probably not the credits, for instance ...)

So far as I know, available in region 1 DVD only in the old 2003 Universal standard DVD; this really needs to be remastered and put on Blu-Ray.",1455926400,,3405,4.560655737704918

I really don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said except maybe this is a ""feel good film"". It takes you back to a more innocent time. If you are ever feeling down, just watch this movie and forget your problems for awhile.

So the only thing to do is give in to the whims of Miss Page and go with her silly and sometimes dangerous ideas which seem to get him in even more trouble.

On the DVD I still enjoy Paula Prentiss' character and her great performance but Rock Hudson is a poor substitute for Cary Grant.  Hudson was much better in Pillow Talk, which I think is mainly due to a better script.  This script is just too silly and slow for an adult.  For an old comedy that holds up well try Pillow Talk and/or Bringing Up Baby.  The widescreen is nice, the picture and sound clear but bonus feature amounts to only the original trailer.",1290816000,2,595,4.139130434782609
221877,3,6300185370,"There is something about this film.

First, it's worth discovering the phenomenon of Paula Prentiss.  She is the lethal combination of a blazing smart woman, sarcastic and confident and hormonal, somehow incarnated as a six-foot model from Texas, complete with that drawl; relaxed, urbane, earthy, fascinating, endlessly sexy.  Accept no substitute.  She is an indispensable archetype, as gorgeous and innately dazzling as Louise Brooks.

And, it is a sixties studio technicolor comedy, with all the burgundy cardigan, Tiffany, champagne, cadillac, mahogany lounge glamour that implies.

The script is about an imposter, a man pretending to be a macho outdoorsman, and the headstrong woman who innocently calls his bluff by believing him.  In retrospect, it seems Rock Hudson gave this idea a very personal interpretation.  His alternately brooding and peevish character is literally haunted, painfully weighed down, by the phony role he makes himself play for money and career. His angst is funny only because the character is so successful.

Beyond the revisionist over-analyzing because Hudson was gay, the film has intentional gender irony playing alongside its lighweight generic storyline.  There is a gag in which the woman tries to help Rock by putting a fake cast on his arm.  But the fake cast freezes his arm upright, like an Olympic torch-bearer or Zeus.  We are forced to recognize that the heroic male stereotype does not fit on this indignant, frustrated man.

Some of the slapstick is tired.  Director Hawks steals his own torn-dress gag from ""Bringing Up Baby"".
But the humor works in other ways, and those ways are unusual, even unique.

Like Rohmer's great ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"", there is no formulaic desire romance.  We are never sure about these two.

One promotional photograph shows the distracted couple, uncomfortably detached from each other. This couple is not destined for needy orgiastic clutching, that ecstatic mutual validation we expect in a love story.  Rather, it is a weird, tenuous but genuinely affectionate solution, an adult intimacy, which they accomplish.  It is strange, and strangely satisfying, in the context of this goofy Hollywood technicolor creampuff.

On a personal note, I can not entirely explain why I have seen this movie so many times, what draws me to it.  Some moment, some gestalt, will not let go.  It is silly but riveting, equally contrived and compelling.  I give it a modest approval rating so as not to disappoint people, but consider it one of the defining films of the sixties.

Outside, a period technicolor comedy held together by two wild and intelligent stars.  Inside, a subversive dimension.",1288051200,4,2671,5.242924528301887

I enjoyed Rock Hudson putting together the tent, the bear riding the scooter, and especially the way he catches fish.

221881,5,6300185370,"Hands-down my favorite Rock Hudson flick. This movie takes me back to a simpler time and place that probably never existed but is so cool. The main character (Rock) works at Abercrombie & Fitch in San Francisco, back when A&F actually sold outdoor gear -- fishing tackle, canoes, waders, everything for the avid outdoorsman. What keeps this romantic comedy fresh and timeless is the juxtaposition of Rock's ostensibly macho character with two clever and capable outdoorswomen played by Paula Prentiss and Austrian beauty Maria Perschey. Though he has literally written the book on fly-fishing, Roger Willoughby (Rock) has never been fishing or camping in his life. To salvage his reputation and an upcoming fishing tournament, the women have less than a week to teach him the ropes. Hudson and Prentiss have such on-screen chemistry I might believe the two were carrying on off-screen as well, if I didn't know better.

The editing of this film ""classic"" is akin to watching a movie on TNT.  I constantly wondered, ""What was cut to allow for the extra 16 minutes of commercials?""  The Paula Prentiss character seemed to suffer the most at the hands of heavy editting, as I struggled to determine why she had a hate-hate-love relationship with the Rock Hudson character, or why he responded the way he did.

She is very obnoxious in the beginning, exasperating in the middle part, and when you get to know her better later, she just seems puzzling.  If that's the character the casting director wanted, then he sure got a good one!
In the best of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedies, the movie seems too short to hold all the great dialogue resulting from the characters' personalities; in this movie though,  you get the opposite feeling,  that the characters can't just sit there, they HAVE to say SOMETHING to fill up the space. Prentiss' character is talkative, so she keeps up the meaningless banter. Hudson's character seems like the type to just silently let her ramble on....but instead, he joins in to keep it going, and here and there it just feels unnatural.  The Hudson/Prentiss formula just doesn't seem like a winning combination.
Wonderful performances by all the cast, and entertaining business about fishing, lakes, etc.",1232928000,,1045,5.023121387283237

Both of them shouted at once, so that is where the trains came from, all of us laughing.

221901,4,6300185370,"As an actor Rock Hudson wasn't considered to have much potential early in his career. He eventually became a good dramatic actor, it wasn't easy, he wasn't the most gifted or talented but he worked hard at his craft. What a surprise it was when he went into comedy. His pairings with Doris Day, for the most part, are outstanding examples of romantic comedies. Man's Favorite Sport? could have easily had Doris Day also.

It is sort of strange to look back on Hudson's career after the revelations came out when he was near death. Whatever his personal preferences he was a solid actor & proved very adept at comedy though it is unique to see his interactions with female leads. Man's Favorite Sport? is a solid comedy that's well worth more than one viewing.

Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) is a salesman at a sporting goods store & has the reputation of being a great fisherman, in fact, he has written a book on it. Many customers call and/or visit him to get his advice. What no one knows is that he's never fished in his life. Enter Abigail Page (Paula Prentiss) & Isolde ""Easy"" Mueller (Maria Perschy- the nickname is never explained) who want Willoughby to enter a fishing tournament. Willoughby confesses to the two women he doesn't have a clue about fishing so they agree to teach him in the seven days before the tournament. Willoughby is extremely unwilling but his boss, William Cadwalader (John McGiver), convinces him it's in the best interest of retaining his job.

The laughs abound as Willoughby proves to be as inept as a fisherman there ever was. The scenes with Roger & Abigail are funny & it's inevitable that Abigail falls for him. Unfortunately Roger is engaged & Abigail is a walking disaster. Love & luck overcomes it all & Willoughby wins at both. Then he has to confess that he's never fished in his life.

Good solid movie that was directed by one of Hollywood's greatest directors, Howard Hawks. This film has some similarities to his screwball comedies of the thirties & forties. If you're a fan of those you will enjoy this one.",1226793600,5,2059,4.663911845730028

I began to worry during the credits which played to possibly the worst movie theme I have ever heard. When I saw the theme was credited to Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini, I was stunned. Then the movie began, and I suppose it was okay if you like comedies that never make you laugh. The movie almost seemed to be an in-joke on Hudson's double life, but I don't suppose that can be proved. Why did the writers have Hudson reveal his secret to Prentiss in the first few minutes? Wouldn't concealment until near the end have given more comic opportunities? Was the fake Indian chief funny even in 1963? I think Hawks forgot at times that he was not directing Cary Grant, whose subtleties and physical grace (with him the scene of climbing upside down into Prentiss's car might actually have been funny) would have added some humor on their own.

When press agent Abigail Page (the delightful Paula Prentiss) finds out about Roger's problem, she decides to give him the ultimate crash course in fishing...

221953,5,6300185370,"Long after his heyday, legendary director Howard Hawks underwent a career resurgence in the early 60's with his box office hits RIO BRAVO (1959) and HATARI! (1962). MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT?, released in 1964, was Hawks's next offering and didn't perform as well in the movie theater. It was the fourth-to-last film he would direct and was intended to be a starring vehicle for Cary Grant, who eventually turned down the role. So in stepped the capable Rock Hudson, who may not be Cary Grant but still was flying high on his two recent successful pairings with Doris Day (PILLOW TALK and LOVER COME BACK).

Here's the plot: MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? involves sporting goods salesman Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) who, based on the popular fishing book he'd written and being hailed as an authority on angling, is invited by Abby Page (Paula Prentiss), the public relations director of the Lake Wakapoogie resort, to participate in its 36th Annual Fishing Tournament, which commences in a week's time. But, unbeknownst to everyone, Roger had never before fished in his life! Nevertheless, with an adamant Ms. Page insisting that he compete or lose his cushy job, Roger has no choice but to learn how to be an outdoorsman in three days, with the dubious assistance of Abby...Um, Roger better bring his book.

This very funny film is a fond callback to the screwball comedies of yore, which really isn't that big of a stretch for Howard Hawks as he himself was responsible for several of the best screwballs ever crafted (TWENTIETH CENTURY, BRINGING UP BABY, HIS GIRL FRIDAY, and BALL OF FIRE). Come to think of it, this film's basic premise is borrowed straight from a William Powell subplot in LIBELED LADY, while Hawks recycles a hilarious sequence from his own BRINGING UP BABY. No, MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT? may not be classic Hawks, but it sparkles enough in its generosity in side-splitting humor and in its breezy Rated G sexcapades. Yes, Roger does manage to nab some fish but certainly not thru any traditional angling means. A bear even figures into two of the comedic sequences, one sequence kinda lame but the other, very funny. But, for all its outdoorsy trappings, this flick is still very decidedly a sophisticated and appealing exercise in bawdiness, rife with visual titillations and innuendos. The fact that Henry Mancini smoothly provides the scoring merely adds to the playful suggestiveness...

While the Gods of the Funny didn't see fit to bestow upon Mr. Hudson Cary Grant's gift for sublimely nuanced expressions and gestures, he does compensate here with several moments of inspired physical comedy. Hudson does attempt to channel Grant at his most befuddled and somewhat succeeds. All in all, Rock Hudson's performance is to be commended. I haven't seen a lot of Paula Prentiss, but she is deliriously good here as she follows Hawks' established pattern for his leading ladies. As Abby Page, she's pushy, ditzy, and winsomely oblivious, the 1960s reincarnation of Katherine Hepburn's Susan Vance. And, oh my, those legs...

Two other lovely women are spotlighted in their splendid scantiness: the good-natured  Maria Perschy as Abby's teutonic pal Easy and Charlene Holt as Roger's fiancee Tex. Norman Alden provides a few worn chuckles as John Screaming Eagle, the resort's scheming American Indian with a hidden heart of gold.

At just around 2 hours long, the movie moves at a brisk pace. This film may not showcase Howard Hawks at his all-time best, but it's not exactly a spoonful of doodoo, either. At 68 years old, he definitely still had mastery of his craft. Hudson and Prentiss provide some diverting give and take. I particularly enjoy Prentiss's offbeat delivery of her lines as well as her uninhibited laughter. Now, you may not learn much about the outdoors from this flick (that ten-eleven-then-nine-o'clock casting routine just doesn't work for me), but you'll have fun snickering at Roger Willoughby as he miserably stews in his own haplessness, with the cheerful Abby each time seemingly laying the groundwork for his next mishap. And, if you're a guy, you get to ogle at some gorgeous women in their nighties. So what's not to like here?",1172966400,7,4169,5.0

This movie was very underrated or perhaps under publicized because I saw it on TV long after it had made the theaters. The premise is creative and the cast is great.  Why wasn't Paula Prentiss in more movies?  She, too, was a wonderful comedy actress.  Laughed and forgot my troubles for at least 90 minutes.",1140652800,4,468,4.728395061728395

You'd like this film if you enjoyed Hawk's screwball comedies, particularly Bringing Up Baby, from which it liberally borrows elements.  You'll also like it if you're a fan of Rock Hudson's light romantic comedies.  But you'll love it if you are a Paula Prentiss fan; she owns the picture, whereas Hudson, who is good too, can but only drift helplessly through the picture.  This film is the only instance of Paula's full realization of the ""Prentissian archetype""; both beautiful and lanky, elegant and awkward, intelligent and dizzy.  While we get a taste of it in Where the Boys Are and The World of Henry Orient and What's New Pussycat, this is the only place to get the full-length treatment.",1129939200,9,803,4.9185185185185185

He turned down both projects, and that is why Rock Hudson ended up staring in two movies that remind others of a Cary Grant movie. Man's Favorite Sport in itself is alright, but I would rather spend my time watching Cary in one of the movies he chose to make, rather than Rock Hudson attempt to pull off dialogue that was written for Cary. I have nothing bad to say about Rock Hudson, I enjoy his movies. But, without the talent, the class, the style, the comedic timing and the presence of Cary Grant in a comedy that was written specifically for him, the movie falls short.",1112572800,3,812,4.456375838926174
221970,2,6300185370,"This is one of those movies where you say to yourself, ""Hey!  No fair!  I want those hours of my life back again!""  It's really pretty bad.  Rock Hudson stars as a fumpfering salesman at the San Francisco Abercrombie & Fitch men's store, whose specialty is selling fishing gear (fishing being a manly, manly pastime...)  The thing is, he doesn't actually do any fishing himself, and when his boss enters him in a big, manly fishing tournament, he runs the risk of being exposed as a fraud.  (Wow!  Heavy drama!  Hold me back.)  Then enter into the mix co-star Paula Prentiss, whose brief glimmer of stardom is truly inexplicable... She's so awful, and so weird!  Her timing is really strange, and her attempts at seeming impish or elfin just make her look like that much more of a weirdo.  She's a very poor substitute for Doris Day, Rock's main co-star at the time... There's also an odd quality to the film itself that throws the pacing off and makes it perpetually wobbly.  I'm not sure, but I think part of it may be that many scenes were actually extended improvs, relying on Pretiss's wackiness and vivacity to carry the day.  It doesn't work, believe me.  This film may have been the high point of her career, but it's an embarrassment for Hudson.",1094256000,12,1254,4.59009009009009
221971,4,6300185370,"A sort of throwback to the screwball comedies of the 1930's.  It reminds one of the pairings of Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn such as Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story.  By that as it may, I have watched this film several times over the years and I am repeatedly impressed with the level of comic intensity throughout the narrative.  The plot line is simple enough:  a fairly solid looking man has great success built on a secret.  Rock Hudson has written a well-regarded book on fishing.  The secret is Hudson has never been fishing in his life.  Along comes Paula Prentiss who corners Hudson into participating in a fishing tournament at her outdoors resort.  Of course, in the end Hudson wins the tournament and is exposed for the fraud he is.  In spite of being proved to be a fake, Hudson comes out on top and falls for Prentiss as well.
As a story none of this is believable but that is never the point.  What we have is a story in which silliness is the point.  How we get from beginning to end is where the art is.  There is no serious message here which is why this film is as light and appealing now as it was forty years ago.  It is also startlingly clean as sex comedies go.  There is no foul language and the most ""flesh"" one sees is a smidgen of panty from an unzipped dress.
We tend to think ourselves as a bit superior about these old movies in that we know Hudson was gay in real life.  ""Ha Ha Ha.  People back then really believed that Hudson would have fallen for Prentiss. .Ha Ha Ha""  Well stuff it.  Hudson was an actor who wanted to make us laugh.  It would be a real tragedy if all we do is laugh at him.",1081468800,82,1634,4.196141479099678
221972,5,6300185370,"This is a forgotten comic gem from master director Howard Hawks (RIO BRAVO).  MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT is a throwback to his early screwball comedies featuring Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn (i.e. BRINGING UP BABY) and even pays homage to '...BABY' recreating a scene from the film. In ""...BABY"", Kate Hepburn's dress is torn at the back, exposing her undergarments, during a posh dinner party. Cary Grant must walk her out by walking behind her and holding her very close in unison with her every step. Rock Hudson does the same thing with actress Maria Perschy in '...Sport' when her dress is torn and exposing her back undergarments during a fishing lodge dinner party.  Rodger Willoughby (Hudson) works at a sporting goods store selling fishing equipment and giving expert fishing advice to patrons. He has even ""written"" books on the subject. However, he has never been, knows nothing, and hates the sport of fishing.  He is then entered into a fishing contest at a resort at the request of the resorts publicity director Abagail (Paula Prentiss) and given the go ahead by the store's manager William Cadwalader (the great character actor John McGiver). When the truth is revealed to her by Rodger, he is entered anyway and must learn the sport along the way and try not to be exposed as a fraud.  Naturally, by sheer luck and hilarious comedic circumstances he is able ""catch"" some fish and win the contest. Hudson, fresh from his bedroom farces with Doris Day is excellent as his character is the victim of all kinds of predicaments brought on by Abagail (Prentiss), who in turn is so annoyingly adorable. Great performances all around with some great support characters, namely Norman Alden (BACK TO THE FUTURE, ED WOOD) as John Screaming Eagle, the so-called lake resort 'Indian' guide, and John McGiver as William Cadwalader as Hudson's boss at the department store.  Overall,  a film with a funny script,some great sight gags when Hudson is fishing (i.e. the bear on the moped), great cast of supporting characters, great outdoor scenery, and the subject of fishing is a always a plus for any movie.",1079481600,7,2103,4.893258426966292

221974,5,6300185370,"Usually, if Rock's not seen getting his brains bashed in by Liz Taylor in Giant, he's being taken to the cleaners by Doris Day in the Doris/Rock trilogy.

But in these two films (Sport & Bedfellows), Rock Hudson finally shows he can actually STAR instead of just co-star in a movie.

It's a welcome change to see him carry the day (even if barely) while towing the leggy Paula and the chesty Gina along with him.

This time out he does some keen outdoor stuff (in Sport), and some good flashback work (in Bedfellows), many years before Tarantino started relying on flipping back and forth in time to a fault.

Yes, it was good to see the Rock avoid letting his roles crumble for a change!
