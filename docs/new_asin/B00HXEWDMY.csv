6242582,5,B00HXEWDMY,"Eureka Seven part 1&2 have come in the mail and for the price you can't go wrong. The Series spans 50 episodes and for 32$$ for dvds its the cheaper and more economical buy. I for one will get the blue rays eventually but for now enjoy it's original format. The blue-rays are just an upscale 1080i so yeah. Anyways this in the Anime Legends category of the once know distributor Bandai Mecha/Romance/coming of age anime genre. Its a total classic in everyway. Top ten anime in my collection for sure. Buy it, watch it, and tell your peeps oh its chok full of Special features with the cast, director, and much more. Enjoy Anime Lovers!",1398124800,4,635,4.482758620689655
6242583,5,B00HXEWDMY,"First off this anime is just amazing, saw it when it was on tv years ago and I also own it on dvd when Bandai released it. There is a huge difference in video quality. I just looks amazing. I have only finished the first disc but trust me, you will not regret your purchase. The only downside to the bluray is that the audio is still 2.0 for both english and the japanese. Other than that it is amazing. Even the backgrounds look better. This is well worth the money you are about to spend.",1398038400,6,490,4.114583333333333
6242584,5,B00HXEWDMY,"Like many others have said, this is a must-buy series for practically anyone who consider themselves fans of anime in general. It has a little bit of everything for most everyone, and does many of them quite well.

A few months prior I ordered the Bandai releases from Amazon when they dropped in price (about $85 for the both of them), and now I have this pre-ordered for the slightly increased Bluray quality and the cool cases.

If you like mechs, romance, comedy, science-fiction... Or just a really good story in general, with great animation and soundtrack, then do yourself a favor and get this legend on Bluray!",1396828800,3,619,4.722222222222222

6242586,5,B00HXEWDMY,"If you have not seen this series then you should probably give it a try if you

A) Are a fan of mecha anime, but are quite bored with other offerings and are open to an actual story with richer world building and character development.

or

B) Are open to watching a rich world filled with plenty of well developed and interesting characters, an interesting story, and a moving romance .

(That should be just about everyone)

Basically, this is one of my favorite robot anime of all time, but it is not about robots or combat (although it has both by the boatload, and done better than most). It's about people and all of the terrible things that happen simply because we don't communicate with each other. It's also about the wonderful things that happen when we do. There are plenty of cliche themes in this series, but they are all done so well, and with such heart, that it will leave you wondering why the world can't be better than it is right now. Now that's a classic piece of work!

If you haven't seen this series, go ahead and buy it, because it belongs in your collection and it's money well spent.",1393804800,7,1111,4.3951219512195125
6242587,5,B00HXEWDMY,"This is what I've been telling those people who are still for some reason are willing to pay outrageous prices for the original Bandai releases to wait for! This is what I'm talking about! And we can thank FUNimation for saving it. I'm a huge E7 fan, and I can't thank them enough! Eureka Seven, is a story of action, romance, and lots of character development. It's the perfect combination of all those! The action is great, but the romance in the story is so touching, it can move you to tears! And don't even get me started on the music. It's my favorite anime of all time, and I think it's also one of the best. I think it belongs up there in the Legendary Anime category along with series like Cowboy Bebop, Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, etc. (You get the idea) So, if you're looking to own the complete series of Eureka Seven, don't waste your money on the super-expensive Bandai releases, BUY THE FUNIMATION PARTS. This anime is highly recommended for fans of mech fights, or people who like a touching romance story, or both. Just buy it! It's amazing.

6242593,4,B00HXEWDMY,"I give this release a 4, and the show a 10 out of 5 stars!! The reason I give this release a 4 out of five is because it is just sloppy compared to the amazing dvd releases by Bandai that skyrocketed in price once they went out of print. On the dads the main menu has epic music, moving pictures, and is overall fun and beautiful to navigate. On the blu-rays it is just duo picture of clouds with slow sleepy music. Though the menus are crisp, and get you where you need to go. They lack the feature that the dvd has giving you the option to skip to the b-part of each episode as well as the opening or ending. And now here is my biggest gripe that I cannot understand why this happens...I know the material is not in native hd! I have NO PROBLEM with that. What I hate is how my ps3, and other blu-ray players automatically upscale the dvd versions of Eureka Seven to full screen, or just shy of....Where as on these blu-ray releases the screen only projects the image in the 4x3 box. So every time I put on the blu-rays I have to manually go to my  hdtvs menu, and change the image to ""stretch"" in order to get the blu-ray image to go full screen, where as the dvd does this for me AUTOMATICALLY without me having to constantly change the tv settings. Its so aggravating having to do this when I want to watch the superior picture of the blu-ray.
 Make no mistake the blu-ray image of the show is a lot brighter, and the lines are more crisp. It is definitely an hd upscale. But the dvd flows naturally with any tv I have put it on without having to navigate tv menus to get the image full screen like on the blu-ray. In conclusion this show is a classic period. It was produced around a time when anime was just starting to get big in the us, and when other great shows were ending. It is a gem, and a good sized show at 50 episodes. Robot fighting action, mystery a very sweet romance, not just between the main characters, but between many supporting as well. And very good humor to go with the sad times. And most importunately...There isn't any fan service ""at least not that i can think of"" This blu-ray edition is probably the best we are going to get, and the price is lower than the dads that some collectors like me have gotten our hands on.",1444780800,,2253,4.1770114942528735

6242602,3,B00HXEWDMY,"NOTE:  This is a review of the DVD, NOT the Blu-Ray set.

Young Renton Thurston lives in the town of Belforest, a boring town (by his lights), where nothing of any consequence seems to happen.  He dreams of riding the waves of light energy that waft through the atmosphere of this planet on his own homemade boogie board, but the light waves around Belforest are too weak for any great riding (or ""lifting"" as it is called).  And then one day a mecha literally falls from the sky, piloted by a mysterious and beautiful young girl....

Let me begin by saying I love the series.  Eureka Seven was one of the first animes I ever saw and convinced me to invest my entertainment dollar in more of this.  It is a great love story, as well as fun sci-fi, with fun and interesting characters, and an intriguing plot line involving alien life forms, fear of the unknown, a sort of surfer culture/rebel hippy gang of free spirits, military and political intrigue, and a megalomaniacal bad guy with dreams of racial purity.

I hesitate giving this collection 3 stars (for the reason stated above regarding the story, it should get five) -- two is probably more like it for this collection, however, for those familiar with the series.  The quality of the DVD picture is quite poor, in my opinion, washed out and blurry, which is a shame because there are some fantastic colorful scenes that simply come off as dull here.  I was hoping to update my Bandai collection, but those discs are still of amazing quality with a clear, sharp picture.  (So why replace the Bandai you may ask?  I'm not a big fan of their packaging -- stacking the discs one on top of the other with nothing in between the surfaces.  I worry about damage to the discs as time goes on and am thinking of putting them in their own sleeves.)  Blu-Ray might be better, although the reviews I'm reading here don't convince me of that.  But if you do not have the series, aren't very picky about picture quality, and are unwilling to pay the price the Bandai sets are now commanding, this may be adequate for you.  Or try the Blu-Ray as you may have better luck with the picture quality.  Or try to budget for the Bandai, they really are of great quality, and, in my opinion, a worthy treatment of this series.  (I see where there are several offers available there for used and new for the Bandai.  I would check them out.)

Like I said, great series.

But for a DVD set, this is very disappointing quality.",1431820800,,2462,4.475336322869955

6242612,4,B00HXEWDMY,"Excellent anime. I have watched this anime several times and it is always one of my favorites. One of the downsides that will never let me give 5 stars to most anime releases in the US is the lack of quality Japanese audio. Almost all anime now seem to come out with excellent English sound but only 2 channels for the original Japanese. Some might argue it isn't necessary because we don't understand the Japanese anyway, but you don't want good sound for the talking but for the music, sound effects, and so on.

6242614,4,B00HXEWDMY,"For what FUNimation had to work with, I would say this is a pretty decent release. I've noticed some sound/music level issues, but nothing major(and that might also just be my setup).

Anyway, there are many reviews of this bluray that rate it low. This is mostly due to 2 things.

1) it's an upscale and not native HD
2) it's in a 4:3 aspect ratio

My response is that this series was never created in a format that would allow for native HD. This is an old show from 2005 and was created before capturing animation in HD was common practice. The material available to FUNimation was NOT in HD. It was an SD source. Also, it was never wide screen and the only way anyone ever would have is if they were manually cutting off the top and bottom with a zoomed in display. Just thought i would throw all this out there.",1417651200,12,816,4.251612903225807
6242615,2,B00HXEWDMY,"I love Blu Ray and often want to replace my Anime on DVD with Blu Ray.

However, this is the one instance that I would recommend the DVD version over the Blu Ray.

For some reason it seems that Funmation decided to downscale the quality with the Blu Ray.

The DVD version supported widescreen format and you would think that the Blu Ray would as well....sadly it does not.  Its set in standard format (4x3) and does not support widescreen (16x9) and I would imagine that anyone purchasing Blu Ray anything has a widescreen TV.

Why Funmation decided to downscale the Blu Ray release of this is beyond me.

Highly recommend you purchase the DVD format for this series.

6242622,4,B00HXEWDMY,"This is billed as the greatest love story ever animated. That's qute a claim especially if there's an animated version of Romeo and Juliet anywhere. The story revolves around a band of anarchic ""surfer dudes"" with mech suits which fly through the sky on giant surfboards. This merry band is called the Gekkostate. They are joined by a 14 year old boy called Renton. There are in fact two love stories in this. The first is between the leader of the Gekkostate and a pilot called Talho. The second love story is between Renton and an odd girl called Eureka. Unusually for an anime the characters do develop and change in response to events. There story takes a darker turn as the past history of the Gekkostate is revealed.
The story becomes quite complex and involved but is not well explained in the box set. The box set contains 26 episodes over four DVDs and there is an additional DVD with some episodes with commentaries. Unlike many multipart series the last episode is not climactic as if this it were the end of a series. Instead it leads directly into the 27th episode which is the first episode of Part Two. Because there are so many unanswered questions in Part One you almost have to watch part two. Very sneaky, very, very sneaky.
This is watchable but I'm not sure that it is enjoyable. The script is very good and the characters are portrayed well but it is probably too long for its own good. I'm glad I have watched it but I'm not sure I will watch it again. That's why I give it four stars and not five.",1407024000,,1521,4.435714285714286

Eureka Seven has done a fantastic job merging the two while keeping the magic of both cultures. Johnny Yong Bosch does an amazing performance as usual and the other characters provide a quality cast for him to play off of emotionally.

Eureka Seven is a good series I highly recommend it... if you don't have Bandai Dvd copy get one because it's more affordable... however it's kinda disappointing that it's not in HD Native... Bandai Dvd VS Funimation Blu-ray... it should be obvious that blu-ray should win... but I got mix feelings when I compare it...

- Bandai Dvd has more vivid color it's super clear for a Dvd
- Funimation Blu-ray is more smoother but blurred or dim (I think to hide the pixelated edges and motion shadow)

In simply term Bandai dvd is like 1.5 ver. while Funimation blu-ray is like 1.7 ver.

I rate it with 3 stars... because it's in blu-ray format with affordable price...",1400025600,2,1091,4.670157068062827
6242630,5,B00HXEWDMY,"I never owned the original Bandai release due to their absurd pricing scheme so when I saw this, I just had to jump on it. Eureka Seven is one of the first anime series I ever saw, and it is with little doubt the reason why I got into other anime series.

In this box set you'll get the first half of the series along with a bonus feature disc. Unfortunately, that bonus disc is just merely a DVD instead of a Blu-ray disc. It mostly includes commentaries and interviews for the voice cast, but I don't find much value in those kinds of bonuses so you won't notice a quality loss between the formats. There are no episodes on the DVD so don't worry about that either.

For image quality, it's as good as you could expect from a series that aired back in 2006. It's not going to look outstandingly crisp like say, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Soul Eater, but it's definitely better than the broadcast quality it had back when it aired on adultswim. It is after all, only 1080i in 4x3 ratio. Nonetheless, it has the classic Bones (animation studio) look to it that I personally thoroughly enjoy.

For sound quality, again, it's about as good as you could expect. Funimation did not appear to make any special effort to go beyond its original 2.0 audio for either English or Japanese. I did notice that there was an occasional popping sound in quieter scenes on my surround system, but nothing distracting or highly prevalent.

All in all, if you've been on the fence about purchasing this series, then this release is probably as good as it's going to get.",1399161600,,1561,4.5053003533568905

6242634,2,B00HXEWDMY,What's to say? Eureka Seven is one of the popular Anime titles. I was so looking forward to getting this series on Blu Ray. But Funimation ruined it totally. People are better off trying to buy the old DVD sets from Bandai. Short story is that I gotten Hellsing Ultimate Blu Ray set from Funimation to which all of the discs have cracks in the outer rim. I was nervous about getting the Eureka Seven sets. So I checked each disc when I opened the two sets. To my horror every disc has the same flaw with the cracks in the discs. Funimation recently is being lazy about producing their Anime on Blu Ray enough to make major mistakes and not checking the sets before shipping them out. Stay away from these sets guys! And this has nothing to do with shipping as I got this set from Rightstuf this time.,1398384000,3,800,4.304635761589404
6242635,4,B00HXEWDMY,"Let's get it out of the way Eureka Seven is a gem of anime, truly a classic! If I was reviewing the show it self I would give it 5 out of 5.

While most recent shows rely heavily on fan service and cliches this show harkens to a time in anime where character development and story used to matter more. From the color palette to the animation and the voice acting (yes I enjoyed the English dub) the attention to detail is obvious and really appreciated.

I was looking forward to witnessing this anime on glorious 1080p quality and while the show does indeed look beautiful one problem is very very disappointing the fact that the ratio that the show is presented in is 4:9 and not 16:9. This basically translates into having two black vertcal bars on your t.v.

Having said that I would still recommend buying this bluray release as it translates to having the best video quality for this anime. Like I stated before the animation and colors that looked great on the dvds now look more vibrant and sharper than they ever did before.

Eureka Seven is prove that anime doesn't need to be filled with cliches and fanservice in order to be both popular and unforgettable. From the second the opening scene begins and you hear the music start to play you will see something different....something special....you will witness Eureka Seven.",1398211200,3,1334,4.616033755274262

8637126,4,B00HXEWDMY,"This show is my favorite anime of all time. I'm giving it 4 stars for the product, not the show. All the discs work fine if you put them in a more recent DVD player (probably 2005 and after). But some discs make a loud noise when inserted inside an older DVD player. I highly suggest getting an older release if you have an old DVD player. Show is sweet though!",1474761600,,361,4.098591549295775

The series was a little weird. I would just rather watch Gundam Wing or Neon Genesis Evangelion (If I wanted real self-punishment). Too bubbly and hippy for me. My wife loved it though. Watched it 4 times through while doing homework as background and as just full enjoyment.",1468022400,,442,4.740259740259741
