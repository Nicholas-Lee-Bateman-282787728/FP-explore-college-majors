4841873,5,B005N0NDYM,"I remember seeing this film on late Saturday afternoons on one of our local TV stations several times.  It was a fun, creepy 'Twilight Zone' - style Seventies film (not just due to the Rod Serling narration), padded out a bit at the beginning and end with non-Serling narration (the end is an unnecessary recap of all three stories).  The first story in particular about three boys cursed by the mother of their dead friend has the most 'Twilight Zone' feel to it.  My personal favorite was the second tale, about a mysterious hole leading to who-knows-where on a 1906 farm.  THIS was the one that really creeped me out as a kid!  The final story is a so-so retelling of the legendary 'Girl on the Bridge' tale so prevalent in modern folklore.

Now be warned - even though it does not say so here, this product is a DVD-R (it says so on the back of the case).  Some players might have trouble with these.  My blu-ray player played it just fine, however.  And I have to admit being surprised at the image and sound quality.  No, its not remastered or anywhere near today's digital film, but they did use a very good print for its age, and it was perfectly watchable and enjoyable.  Its certainly miles ahead of an old VHS release I bought back in the late 80's (in fact that's why I was nervous about this DVD, fearing they might have just copied the crappy VHS tape).

If you like these creepy old anthologies from the 1970's, then this film is for you.",1451347200,4,1453,4.400749063670412
4841874,5,B005N0NDYM,"This is a classic creeper that I used to watch when it came on TV back in the mid to late '70's.  There are three stories being told here, narrated by Twilight Zone's Rod Serling.  The first story scared me the most, and I will never forget the look in the grieving mother's eyes when she says ""One by land, two by sky...""  Gave me nightmares for weeks!  The second story, about a mysterious, bottomless hole in the middle of a field, was also creepy and memorable.  The third story, which is a familiar story of a ghostly woman on a bridge, was not quite as frightening as the first two, but it was still pretty good.  I haven't seen ""Encounter with the Unknown"" in many years, and I am excited to finally own it on DVD!!",1442188800,2,722,4.233576642335766

4841876,5,B005N0NDYM,I loved this movie when I was a kid. Having it now makes me feel like I am back in those days.,1363392000,,94,3.3181818181818183
4841877,2,B005N0NDYM,"I first saw this film when I was about ten years old on Creature Features (the version broadcast on KTVU in Oakland with the great Bob Wilkins as host). Like many movies that scared me when I was a child, the fear factor just wasn't the same when I viewed this as an adult. The first and third stories, about a curse put on a trio of friends who accidentally get a fourth friend killed and a spectral girl who haunts the bridge where she was killed are pretty standard fare whose endings you'll guess within the first few minutes of the stories. Only the second story about a mysterious hole in the ground near a rural 1906 Missouri town that gives off terrible moaning sounds still packs somewhat of a punch and is by far the best of the three. The production values are grade B except for the narration by the great Rod Serling. Plus, the film, like so many from the 70's, is very dated (musical romantic interludes with bad guitar music, bell bottom pants, long hair, etc). Still, it was fun to see this movie again if only to laugh at what used to scare me as a child.

The truly bad thing about this DVD, however, was the video quality. It looks as if the transfer was taken off a fourth generation VHS tape that was left out in the sun. The first few minutes, especially, are blurry with numerous flaws in the picture. At one point the video quality gets so bad the viewer expects the film to break despite the image coming from a DVD. The sound is murky and sounds like it was recorded underwater. In short, it plays like a pirated copy. As I said before, the film isn't Lawrence of Arabia, so the poor video quality isn't taking away from a masterpiece. However, it's probably one of the worst DVD's, quality-wise, I've ever seen.

Rating for the film = **-1/2
Rating for video quality = 1/2*",1361318400,4,1800,4.354166666666667
4841878,4,B005N0NDYM,"ENCOUNTERS WITH THE UNKNOWN is an early 70s anthology film, narrated by Rod Serling (TV's TWILIGHT ZONE, and NIGHT GALLERY). Part one is about three friends who die one by one, after being cursed by the mother of a man who died due to their prank. Part two concerns a mysterious hole / pit in the ground. Eerie, growling sounds rise from the pit, causing the local town-folk to investigate. Of course, no good comes of this! Part three has a man and wife who pick up a strange woman on a bridge. She asks to be driven home, and the fun begins. All three of these tales are based on supernatural legends. They are more like stories from ONE STEP BEYOND, than either TWILIGHT ZONE or NIGHT GALLERY. Serling's narration is great, reminding me of what a loss it was when he passed on...",1360022400,,782,4.4

8480081,1,B005N0NDYM,"Film quality is terrible and the acting is worse.  Even if you believe in the paranormal, this is difficult to watch.  Think reading the stories would be much more rewarding. For me it was not informative nor scary.",1523836800,,215,4.631578947368421
8480082,2,B005N0NDYM,"Three hokey tall tales reenacted on a very low budget with a cast of local theatre group actors and featuring intros and outros for each segment (Twilight Zone style) by Rod Serling, whose voice-over probably cost the lion's share of the film's budget (what little budget there was).

Today these would be called urban legends, although this film's marketing claimed they were ""true stories"" without any attempt to substantiate the claim.

Not the best print of an already-unattractive film.  The camera work is flat and static, the film is grainy to the extent of being fogged, the colors are muted, and the audio is a hollow monotone.  In other words, typical low-budget from the early 1970s and hastily-transferred to DVD from a second-or-third-generation copy.

The acting, for the most part, is not bad; however, the actors aren't very photogenic... which may be a good thing, if they were shooting for realism.

Again, it's the very generalized fictional subject matter that brings this project down.

The first segment is about a cryptic curse that comes true, bringing justice to three pranksters; the second segment is about a hole in the ground that locals suspect is a gateway to some subterranean horror; and the last segment is a variation of the ""Resurrection Mary"" story (a ghostly girl on the roadside hitches a ride with a kindly stranger, but she vanishes from the car before they reach her destination).  Ho-hum.

The film may have some nostalgic value to those who remember it from their childhood, but it doesn't stand on its own as entertainment.",1523664000,,1568,4.977011494252873
8480083,5,B005N0NDYM,"Despite clearly having been filmed on a low budget (on location in Arkansas), the genuinely creepy anthology film ""Encounter with the Unknown"" does establish a respectable atmosphere. It's co-scripted by director Harry Thomason, taking its inspiration from three urban legends. Given that legendary 'Twilight Zone' creator Rod Serling is involved, it's nothing if not interesting. It examines ideas such as the dividing line between illusion and reality, the power of the human mind - or, to be more specific, the power of belief - and the concept of witchcraft.

Serling is one of two narrators - the other gentleman is used for the opening two minutes and during the final ten minutes - and does his usual commendable job at drawing us into these stories and giving us the alleged facts of each case. Each of these tales has some potent and chilling moments, and the cast is very good. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED.",1523318400,,911,4.993421052631579

One can find more horror and insanity on Capitol Hill these days.

8480087,5,B005N0NDYM,"I fitst saw this when I was around 11 or so and it has nevery left me. Now this is just a fun kind of spooky movie of tales. But they evoke such a sense in the unknown still I find it enjoyable.
The on the cover the actress, her voice and her eyes still gives me goose bumps.
And the narration although direct to the tale of the dogs lost in the hole and while trying to rescue him, the narrator says , they.expected to find the worst outcome and in fact did .Which out true to our daily lives if you expect the worst outcome in most cases you get. And at 11 that's one thing. I took away from this movie.
The girl on the bridge story is told wonderfully even has very nice song in the story.
And again the narration to me is right on the mark about not forgetting those who have pasted and a sense of obligation to keep them with us.
But it is a fun movie , done very well.
Hope you.enjoy it as much as I have for some 40 years.",1481328000,,929,3.869109947643979
