324822,4,6301325540,"John Wayne stars in this thoroughly entertaining film about Marine WWII pilots. The Duke takes command and drives his men hard to accomplish the mission of close air support - a very dangerous endeavor. While his XO does not agree with his methods, he does come to appreciate them later on.

Flying Leathernecks includes some excellent real combat footage from WWII, which adds a nice touch of authenticity. The characters and dialogue will engage the viewer, and really help keep the plot moving along.

If you like the movie Flying Tigers, or other WWII aviation films then you will enjoy this one. Or, if you simply like the Duke in military films, then this one is also worth viewing.",1159920000,,688,4.773109243697479
324823,4,6301325540,"Flying Leathernecks is an entertaining John Wayne adventure about a squadron of Marine fighters stationed on Guadalcanal during the fierce fighting.  The Duke plays Major Daniel Kirby, a new squadron leader who tries to get the men into fighting shape as he tries to prove his theory of ground attacks heavily supported by air support.  Kirby and his executive officer, Captain Griffin butt heads as they argue over how to treat the men.  The plot might sound familiar to Sands of Iwo Jima which it is, but it is still a quality movie.  The aerial shots are taken from actual WWII footage that work pretty well with the shots of the actors in their planes.  The story is fairly predictable, but it is still worth a watch if nothing else.
  John Wayne is pretty good as tough as nails Major Kirby, a role very similar to his role as Sergeant Stryker that earned him a Best Actor nomination.  Robert Ryan gives a decent performance as Captain Griffin, who Kirby believes is not ready to take over command of the squadron.  Wayne and Ryan work well together throughout.  Don Taylor plays Griffin's brother-in-law and fellow squadron member.  Jay C. Flippen has a very funny role as Master Sergeant Clancy, Kirby's line chief who has a talent for taking things that are just lying around.  Like all Duke movies, I hope this one gets a DVD release since the VHS is not in the best of shape.  For an enjoyable Duke adventure, check out Flying Leathernecks!",1061683200,17,1450,4.661417322834645
324824,3,6301325540,"The Duke himself is in this movie about Marine pilots in the South Pacific during World War II.  Since this movie was made in the fifties, there is not a lot of gore and violence.  The fight scenes you see are mostly actual footage from aerial combats during WWII.
The movie centers around two things.  First, it shows the usage of military planes providing close ground support.  Repeatedly, everyone mentions it can't be done, but the Duke and his group continue to show that it is viable.  Second, we see the agonies of command.
John Wayne is a major who is not always liked by his subordinates.  He is a career military man trying to keep his team, mostly young college men, alive by enforcing discipline.  He drives them relentlessly as the executive officer tries to ease up on them.  By the end of the movie, the executive officer gets an explanation on why it is necessary for commanders to push their men.
For military film buffs or John Wayne fans, I would highly recommend seeing this movie.",1022544000,24,1002,4.589887640449438

324960,4,6301325540,"Major Dan (John Wayne) has the dubious task of dealing with pilots who lack discipline.  The reason they are slipshod is due to the bad example of Captain Carl (Robert Ryan).  He wants to be their pal rather than their commander.  Their failure to take orders gets several killed.  Fortunately, Major Dan will have none of that and soon whips them into shape, scorning Captain Carls crybaby approach of coddling them.

The overly familiar plot hampers much of the production.  Howard Hughes decision to include wartime combat footage also doesnt help as all of these scenes have a scratchy used look that doesnt blend well with the pristine set pieces.  Its like flipping a channel between a documentary and a war movie that isn't pretending to be a documentary.

Jay C. Flippen is a hoot as the MSgt Line Chief with sticky fingers.  If it isn't nailed down and even if it has a name on it, he finds a better use for it with his company (everything from a rocking chair to a cake).",1468454400,,981,4.56

324962,5,6301325540,"I disagree with those who dismiss this movie as just another jingoistic war picture.  Next to ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" and perhaps ""The Fighting Seabees"", I consider this one of John Wayne's best war movies.  I grant that the cinematography and the writing could have been better, but the dichotomy between the two lead characters is enough to hold my fascination.  John Wayne plays Major Daniel Kirby, who has just taken over command of a squadron of newly-minted fighter pilots.  Robert Ryan plays his executive officer, Captain Carl ""Griff"" Griffin.  Griff served as exec under the preceding commander, and his men are surprised when he's not appointed as the new commander.

The squadron soon gets orders to leave for Guadalcanal, where they get their first taste of combat.  Dan and Griff get along well enough at first, but tensions begin to mount as their differences in personality and leadership style begin to surface.  Dan seems cold and callous in his willingness to send men to their deaths.  Griff, by contrast, is much more compassionate toward the men, but his compassion gets in the way of his ability to make tough decisions, and Dan considers him an ineffective leader.  In fact, Dan loathes the realities of combat as much as Griff, but he understands it's part of the job.  No doubt he shares the sentiment expressed by General George Patton: ""Every commander, no matter what his rank, has to send to certain death every day a certain number of men.  Some of them are his personal friends; all of them are his personal responsibility.  Any man with a heart would want to sit down and bawl like a baby, but [a commander] can't, so he sticks out his jaw and swaggers and swears.""

[SPOILER ALERT]  By the movie's end, Dan and Griff gain a new respect for each other.  Griff has to make a difficult decision that results in the death of his closest friend.  As a result, he is able to see things from Dan's perspective.  Meanwhile Dan is relieved of command due to combat injuries, and upon his recommendation, Griff takes over as the new commander.  As Dan boards his plane to leave for the States, he reminds Griff that combat command is a very stressful and lonely job.

If you like a movie that keeps a good balance between patriotism and the harsh realities of war, I highly recommend ""The Flying Leathernecks"".",1464652800,,2333,4.713580246913581

""They Were expendable"": This introduces the specifics of PT Boat naval warfare in WW2 in the Pacific theater in the lives of those who participated and the practices and personal sacrifices and actions that took place to make our service in that effort and made us successful.

""Flying Leathernecks"": This also gives us a great introduction into the specifics of aerial warfare in WW2, also in the pacific theater and gives us a pretty fair look into the lives of those who took part and their families sacrifices while the war was going on.

All in all, this DVD offers us great insight adorned with educational satisfaction with reality exposed into these 2 special groups of our freedom fighters during extremely trying times for America.",1442707200,,1002,4.847953216374269

325408,4,6301325540,"This white and black film made in 1951 tells the story of airmen of US Marines Corps during the battles of Guadalcanal (August 1942-February 1943) and later Okinawa (April-June 1945). John Wayne and Robert Ryan play two main roles.

The film begins with Major Daniel X. Kirby (John Wayne) arriving with new planes and pilots on Henderson Field, the only airfield Americans have on Guadalcanal. Kirby is also there to take command of the fighter squadron based on Henderson Field, much to the disappointment of almost all the pilots who hoped this post will go the very popular Captain Carl Griffin (Robert Ryan). But as the battle of Guadalcanal goes on and butcher's bill increases, there will be finally little time for personal grudges... Much later, the few survivors of this desperate battle will meet again during the bloody Okinawa campaign, during which they will fly better planes, but also face hundreds of Japanese fighters and kamikazes...

This is a very honest, solid war film, made in this pretty jingoistic style characteristic to the movies from 40s and 50s. This film is inspired by real events and tries seriously to stick to historical realities. John Wayne's character (Major Kirby) was modeled on a real person - Major John L. Smith, an ace who downed 19 Japanese fighters and bombers during the Guadalcanal campaign flying from Henderson Field and who received later Medal of Honor for this achievement.

American air units on Guadalcanal were nicknamed Cactus Air Force, from the coded name ""Cactus"" given to Guadalcanal during the campaign. The bloody and by moments pretty desperate fight waged by airplanes operating from Henderson Field is really well described in ""Flying Leathernecks"". The fight in the air was not always the most dangerous part - Henderson Field was almost daily subject to bombing and strafing by Japanese air planes operating from Rabaul and Buka airbases and almost every night Japanese warships shelled American airbase. The Japanese had also in the monutains of Guadalcanal a couple of heavy long range guns (naval pieces mounted on wheels) which kept a daily schedule of slow rate irregular firing on Henderson Field - by avoiding any fire patterns they made certain that pilots and mechanicians who ventured on the airfield in the open could never know if it was not precisely the moment when a heavy shell was already on its way towards them... The always present threat of this ""death from above"" is also well shown in this film.

Relations between people and dialogs are pretty good. Kirby is the lonely guy in charge, who must press his men to give the maximum, knowing that as a result many of them will die. Griffin is a more human, more compassionate character - but exactly for that reason he is not the right person to command in such a terrible, long battle. This weakness of character will finally catch up with him much later during the battle of Okinawa, in an absolutely devastating manner...

There is some humor in the film, mostly provided by Master Sergeant Clancy, the chief mechanician of fighter squadron, able to repair virtually any damaged plane. He is also the greatest thief of fuel and spare parts on Guadalcanal and the most feared serial pilferer of food, cloth and liquor warehouses in all Pacific War Theatre! The fate will also catch up with him ultimately...)))

US Air Force offered generous support to make this film and as a result we can see some good air sequences - also, some real World War II footage was included in the film. However, in one point the film had to differ from reality - in 1942 Cactus Air Force fighters were Grumman F4 Wildcats, but in 1951 there were no more even one such a plane operational in US Air Force or US Navy, and therefore the planes we see in the film are more modern and more powerful Grumman F6 Hellcats. On another hand, for Okinawa battle in 1945, US Marines air units used Vought F4 Corsairs and in 1951 there were still hundreds of those available - and therefore we can see them in also in this film.

In conclusion, this is a good war film, still very watchable, sticking pretty close to the historical truth and definitely a must for all John Wayne's fans - however it never was exactly an immortal masterpiece and it also aged a tiny little bit. Still I liked it. Watch it and enjoy!",1351209600,2,4321,4.776439089692102

SYNOPSIS--
Maj. Daniel Kirby (Wayne) assumes command of a Marine air squadron when executive officer Capt. Carl 'Griff' Griffin (Ryan) is passed over for promotion. What Kirby sees of Griffin at Guadalcanal doesn't inspire confidence, and when called to D.C. he too recommends that someone other than 'Grif' lead the squadron. Their parting almost ends in fisticuffs. Kirby's Washington billet doesn't last long; he's sent back into the fray and 'Grif' is again second-in-command. Only the fight ahead will determine if he's capable of handling this responsibility.

325446,3,6301325540,"They Were Expendable

Shot during the closing weeks of WWII, They Were Expendable is the somewhat real life story of the American defeat in the Philippines as seen through the eyes of the men of a PT boat squadron commanded by Lt. John Bulkeley (called Brickley in the film and played by Robert Montgomery) and his second in command Lt. Robert Kelly (named Rusty Ryan played by John Wayne). The concept of PT boat warfare is a new idea to the navy and the men are given limited assignments. The movie was directed by Capt. John Ford USNR and based on a screenplay by Cmdr. Frank (Spig) Wead, USN who became the subject of another John Ford movie entitled The Wings of Eagles (1957).

There is no elaborate plot to the film, no Hollywood drama here, no special effects, no plot twisting events, just ordinary men doing an ordinary job under difficult times. It is simply the story of men trying to survive on a day to day basis in wartime. They are having to cope with the loss of their fellow crewmen and the defeat which they can sense is coming as the United States slowly retreats from the Philippine Islands. These men are meant to buy time, a delaying action, until the United States can gather its forces for all out war.

There is little or no real emphasis on combat scenes and the scenes are limited, almost as if they were unintended. The minor characters of the film (the men of the PT boat crews) are hard to follow in that their speaking parts are limited, making remembering them as individuals difficult. Donna Reed's character, Sandy an army nurse, really wasn't worth the extra scenes given to her but is more in tune with Ford's having to have a romantic character in the text of the film. The film is worth seeing, giving the viewer an incite into early days of WWII.

Flying Leathernecks

It's Marines, Marines and more Marines in this action adventure of WWII. John Wayne and Robert Ryan star as the commander and executive officer of VFM 247 fighter squadron assigned to fight it out on the island of Guadalcanal with close air support for ground troops, but Wayne and Ryan are constantly at odds as to how to manage this group of young college aviators. The movie resembles the story of Pappy Boyington and the Black Sheep squadron, VMF 214, but with more antagonism and less humor. There is plenty of action in this movie and lots of authentic combat footage.

Wayne and Ryan are not at their best in this movie for they simply do not fit the profile of typical Marine officers and the story line tends to drag.

If you are looking for more of a story about historical events then this film may disappoint but its worth a one time see.

""Flying Leathernecks"" is an incredible piece of history, showing F6F Hellcat fighters and F4U Corsair fighters in air operations in the Pacific and on Essex class aircraft carriers.  If you enjoy seeing these historic ships and planes in real color, you should also consider ""Dive Bomber"" with Fred McMurray which shows air operations in 1941 on the USS Enterprise (CV-5).

These are great movies for any 2nd world war history buff.",1188518400,2,809,4.840579710144928

Maybe because I was just a little kid, and the war was still raging, (1945) but nearing an end. Maybe it was partially because my grandfather took me to see this movie as he took me to see other movies every Saturday, and maybe it was because my Polio was gone and I could walk and run again, but mostly because my uncle was the skipper of a PT boat and knew JFK. Great Direction by John Ford, with his regular crew plus Robert Montgomery, (John Wayne, Donna Reed, Ward Bond) and many other great stars gave outstanding performances in an authentic, tropic ambiance displayed convincingly, though in Black and white.

The missions, struggles, disappointments, amiable characters just doing a very tough, under-appreciated job in plywood PT boat's which the navy and marines didn't entirely trust.

The secondary question was; would Monty and The Duke bring home a winner, or switch to submarines?

This is a short intro of the coming of age of a PT boat fleet, the hopelessness that hung like a black cloud of Damocles just above the heads of the officers and grunts in what then seemed a losing effort, but one in which they kept grinding on with the stiff-upper lip, hard bitten, toughness of ordinary men and women doing extraordinary things.

At this point in the war, the US was not yet winning, and beneath the surface the fighting men and women worried, more about whose fate was unknown than themselves. The milieu and attitudes of the characters gave one a feeling of what it really must have been like in those dark times. When my uncle came back from action a year later, he said it was one of his favorite war films-authentic and revealing.

FLYING LEATHERNECKS
The second film, made in 1951, which was filmed in Technicolor, Flying Leather Necks, directed by Nicolas Ray and starring Wayne, Robert Ryan and an excellent supporting cast, was a typical fighter pilot film, well done, filled with the conflicts, misunderstandings, emotional struggles with tensions of death and mistakes and orders which are hard to follow at times. A good film but less of a classic than the Black and white above. Besides all of that, one Great film, one good film and a terrific price. By the way, this movie borrows just a bit of its plot from a 1938 Howard Hawks directed, Errol Flynn, vehicle: Dawn Patrol. The rankling relationship of Wayne with Robert Ryan, is almost parallel to Flynn's relationship to his commanding officer, Basil Rathbone. Except in this film, the roles are reversed. Here, the leading man, Wayne is the commander,  and Ryan his second in command. However, in Dawn Patrol, the underling, Flynn is the leading man and co-star Rathbone his commander.",1181692800,4,2691,4.788793103448276

325486,3,6301325540,"'Flying Leathernecks' illustrates the problems of leadership...

Major Dan Kirby (John Wayne) is commander of a Marine Corps fighting unit sent to Guadalcanal to give support to the ground troops... He is short of planes and pilots, and drives his men to the point of complete breakdown...

The executive officer, Griff (Robert Ryan) objects to Kirby's hard treatment of the men, but he lets his human feelings cloud his judgment... For a soldier that is bad... Kirby is recalled to the States to train pilots in his new low-level attack technique, and before leaving he informs Griff that he does not consider him fit to command... He hasn't yet got the guts to lead...

When they are reunited later, the hostility between them is intense... An emergency arises, and there is a scramble to get into the air to intercept a formation of Japanese bombers...

In the air, Griff's brother-in-law develops engine trouble, turns back and suddenly finds Japanese fighters on his tail... He radios for help... It is Griff's decision... Reluctantly, he commands his men to proceed... They are not to turn back...

Ray was a dynamic, socially conscious director with a keen visual sense and a gift for attaining fluid motion on the screen... He was more comfortable with the darker shadings of 'Rebel Without a Cause' and 'Johnny Guitar,' but he gets fine performances from his stars...

Wayne's strict discipline play well against Ryan's angry intensity, even if everyone in the audience understands that they're going to wind up on the same side by the end of the film...

The air combats shots are impressive but Ray never really puts the viewer in the airplane the way the best flying films do... Nothing here comes close to John Guillermin's 'The Blue Max', 1966 or even Howard Hughes' 'Hell's Angels', 1930.",1167436800,9,1803,4.930693069306931
325487,5,6301325540,"""They Were Expendable"" has to be among the most underated war movies ever!

There is little else to say except that this is an outstanding movie.

""Leathernecks"" is a good one also, and provides an interesting comparison for the movie buff. Side by side like this, one can easily come to a conclusion about the repective directors. A critical look at these two together shows just how good John Ford was. Not to knock ""Leathernecks"", but Ford is the best director Hollywood likely ever had, and it shows in making a terrifc movie about...excuse me....but, P.T. boats??! Who else ever tried that and hit a home run?",1166832000,2,614,4.728971962616822
