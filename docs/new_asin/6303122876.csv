568836,5,6303122876,"In my opinion, The Dark Crystal surpasses all other fantasy movies, even such established greats as Star Wars and ET, for one simple reason - pure and unadulterated creativity.  Jim Henson's genius explodes into this  fantastical film, with characters of the like that are not seen in any  other film.  Not once does a human appear on the screen - everything is  either animatronic or simply a hand puppet.  A superb film for anyone who  loves fantasy films, the Muppets, or just wants to see a mind-blowing film.",917395200,,513,4.761363636363637

569087,5,6303122876,"The Dark Crystal is an epic fantasy and adventure film created by renowned puppeteer Jim Henson.  All characters in this film are puppets and there are no human characters in this visually stunning movie.  The film fits the traditional hero's quest genre that one would see in Greek mythology (the Twelve Labors of Hercules, Jason and the Golden Fleece) or Arthurian literature.  Though made in 1982 it has great relevance from a cinematic perspective and has stood the test of time (especially in an age of computer generated images and characters so common in current movies).  The themes of courage and sacrifice are well developed as well as the concept of good versus evil.  I recently saw this movie during a special showing in the theaters and really enjoyed it.  It is not too scary but some of the characters are ugly and might be a little frightening for young children.  Still, this is a family friendly film about heroism and unselfishness.",1522368000,,952,4.839506172839506

569164,5,6303122876,"Top line: An amazing technical achievement and fun fantasy that stands the test of time.

Rented from Amazon to watch with my 5yo son.

Good: The Dark Crystal is a technical masterpiece, showing the value and timelessness of true craftsmanship and practical effects. In the 21st century, this film would cost $200 million to make and be loaded with shoddy CGI and overbearing voice actors from your favorite Thursday night sitcoms. But in 1982, Jim Henson, Frank Oz, and crew were given the creative freedom and resources to produce a tale that captured the imagination of viewers for generations. Images from TDC still both amaze and haunt to this day, from Trial by Stone, to Kira taking flight, to anytime the Garthim appear to terrorize. A terrific cast of characters and creatures, many of whom remain unnamed (yet unforgettable).

Bad: Unfortunately, the lead, Jen, is very weak. Although he starts off in a tropish, by-the-numbers foundling quest, his story quickly falls by the wayside as he is ushered from plot point to plot point. He's doesn't have much to do, and repeatedly ends up watching his female companion, Kira, steal the show. Not only does Kira repeatedly save the duo from imminent danger, [SPOILERS] but SHE is the one that makes the ultimate sacrifice in the climax while Jen sits mostly dumbfounded, waiting for inspiration.[/SPOILERS]

Other: I had no idea that Netflix was planning a 2018 prequel series to TDC before randomly settling down to watch this with my son, but the timing was great. Don't miss out on catching up on this classic before the new series hits!",1520726400,3,1595,4.9182156133829

569368,5,6303122876,"The 80's seemed to have a better grasp on edgy, kid's fantasy than we do now (Stranger Things, an intentional throwback to this type of media, is a rare exception). It seems to be that works for kids are almost all bubblegum and smiles, with a handful of dark-but-not-too-dark moments here and there.

The Dark Crystal might be the perfect example of how to make this tone work - from the very first scene, we know what type of movie this will be. Jim Henson's excellent creature creations, the Skeksis, show us a world that is both whimsical but also demented and fear-inducing. The scene in which the dying Skeksis emperor crumbles to dust easily counts as one of the scariest nightmare-inducing moments of my own life, and I wouldn't want a childhood without it.

From here, everything's got you: the music, the look, the story and the characters are all top-notch fantasy stuff, even if it isn't anything we haven't seen before if you've read Howard, Tolkienn or Dunsany. It feels, for a few hours, like we're literally peeking into another world and watching drama unfold among its inhabitants. It's dark, sure, but it's also very light-hearted, playing hopscotch with the line between a nightmare and a dream.

This disk includes a load of bonus features that go way into detail about how the film was created, its inspirations, and a view into the mind of the sorely-missed Jim Henson. If you have kids and you want to get them into fantasy, The Dark Crystal (and Henson's equally brilliant Labyrinth) is how to do it! I love it, my son loves it, my wife loves, and it's a great adventure to share with the whole family...except perhaps for particularly sensitive young ones. But if you think your kids can handle it, you can't go wrong with Jim Henson's unsung masterpiece. If only it were as popular as some of his other, friendlier creations.",1513036800,,1852,4.709876543209877

569631,5,6303122876,OMG where do i begin?!! The Dark Crystal was an amazing movie! If you love fantasy and a story unlike any other you really need to see this movie. Jim Henson (may he RIP) was a genius. How he is able to come up with this world and bring it to life is nothing short of miraculous. It truly is a wonder to behold. I absolutely can't wait for the Netflix series!,1497571200,2,359,4.0
569632,2,6303122876,I remember loving this movie as a kid.  I loved it so much that I happily awaited the day that I could share it with my own children.  I was wrong.  So wrong.  The story makes very little sense and a lot of it is told to the viewer rather than shown.  Maybe in the 80s we were still just happy that someone thought to make a movie for us -without YouTube and Netflix we had some pretty limited choices.  This one does not stand the test of time.,1497312000,,445,3.943820224719101

569637,5,6303122876,"Jim Henson's first non-Muppet feature length is not only a tour de force in puppetry and animatronics, but a heavyweight contender in screen fantasy. It has something that's lacking from the (mostly) rubbish spewed out by the Michael Bay Clone Army of the twenty-first century: a heart, a pulse. A world that lives and breathes. I find it easier to suspend disbelief when the imagery doesn't compell me to pick up my Xbox controller. The marriage of visions between Brian Froud, one of the greatest artists of his time, and Henson, one of the greatest human beings who ever lived, is a most pure and holy one (see: their second child, 1986's Labyrinth). It's also worth mentioning that The Dark Crystal is the first movie I can remember seeing in a theatre (assumingly on a second-run) in my lifetime.",1496188800,,801,4.76978417266187

The world that Jim Henson and Brian Froud create still astonishes me to this day, with beautiful sets, amazing creatures, and stirring music. This DVD comes packed with very interesting special features, that enticed me to buy this release even though I already owned a previous version! Watching scenes with the villainous characters speaking their original made-up language was especially odd since I knew the movie so well.

Any fan of fantasy owes it to themselves to watch this movie, especially now that there is going to be a Netflix prequel series. I hope the series renews interest in this cult classic movie that deserves way more attention then it gets.",1495756800,6,748,4.889763779527559

569734,5,6303122876,"I'm tempted to give this film 4 stars, and at the risk of getting ""booed"", it's because the film does use puppets, it's main selling point, to tell a very interesting fantasy story.  I actually liked a lot of the supporting characters, the scope and scale of the production that as fueled by pure imagination of Henson and his magnificent creative team, but at times it seems like select portions of the puppetry feels like puppetry.

Now, having said that, it's actually supposed to be that, but for me it seemed like at times that the puppets should have been a bit less puppet like, but given the design and intent of the film, that was in fact impossible.

The truth of the matter is that this production is massive and impressive on all levels.  And seeing it in bluray really makes all the artistic detail really stand out.  Details that the common viewer hadn't seen since it was released in the theatres are now presented without any old television raster or blurred low compression DVD video transfer data rates.  You can actually see all of the subtle artistic flourishes that adorn the plot and story with incredibly creative visuals.

The story focuses on the splintering of personalities of whole entities into good and bad, and how each vies for control of the land.  Which side will win?  And what part does Jen play?  There's a very standard psychological plot here, including the addition of a female character to help Jen.

On top of that this film has one of the best scores I've ever heard created for a fantasy feature film.  Truly the music is wonderful, which should help draw in young viewers who take a shine to this film to classical music.

All in all it's a very marvelous film, though again, it is puppetry, and one does wonder how well puppet actors carry a film.  But, with all the production values added to make it visually and auditorily interesting, the film does entertain.

See it once.  Enjoy.",1489968000,3,1931,4.635294117647059

569889,5,6303122876,"So if you are not even a bit weird and into Jim Henson or Tim Burton directors then this movie is not for you. My brother and I watched this when we were little and he fell in love. I liked it however, my brother loved it. So when his 24th birthday was coming up I was trying to figure out a heart felt present for the weirdo. I was looking online and then looked on amazon and BAM! It popped up and I knew it was a sing to get this for him. Any time we would go to our Nana's house over the years he would grab her vhs player and the vhs movie and watch it before doing anything. So I figured why not get him his own and upgrade to a dvd. He was truly moved and loved it. He was so surprised that I found it on dvd, and so was I. :) Great price and wonderful storyline.
This movie is Muppets meets the dark side, kind of. However, it is a beautiful and sad story of good triumphing over the bad. (in my opinion).",1483056000,4,913,3.8105263157894735

""The Mithra Treatment, Henson's original treatment of the film"" is what caught my eye on the boxed set.  I imagined this would be some alternate cut or featurette.  Nope, This is a text-only feature on the disc.  What's worse than reading text on your tv?  If you are a Crystal fan and already own an earlier release, save your cash, you've got the best-to-date.  If a slick box, one frame of the celluloid (probably repro) and some faux hand-written legal pad notes is what you need to round out your DC experience then pick this up.

I had no idea what she was so hyped about since I had never heard of the Dark Crystal before so we ordered it. I guess to a child this movie is mesmerizing. All the characters are puppets but not happy looking puppets like the muppets. These are grim looking creatures that would probably frighten a small child. This would probably make a decent stage play since the costumes were well made even for the time but to sit and watch it as a movie, I dozed off a few times.",1462320000,,600,4.181034482758621

I have watched a few documentaries and youtube clips of Jim Henson's creation of this movie and Labyrinth and it has really made me love them even more.  I grew up watching this movie, so it is really nostalgic to me and I believe that his movies really sparked my creative side growing up. I think that you have to have a certain appreciation for the sci-fi that this film is and the decade it came out in. I had my friends watch it (who were born in the 90's) and they thought it was so weird and bizarre. I just love this movie and have such an appreciation for J.H. work. He was and is such an artist in my mind and I am so fascinated in his work. And bring on the 80's love, my favorite decade by far!!!",1456876800,,885,4.086206896551724

570832,5,6303122876,"Back in the early nineties while at work one day going about my duties I was whistlingSesame Street. I didn't even realize it until a couple coworkers pointed it and we all had a good laugh. Thats how having little kids around the house affects you. These single free men usually carried a tune to someone like Guns & Roses. And Im rockin Sesame Street. One of the first signs of parental insanity I guess.

Either way, my kids (and I) loved this 1982 movie, and since the grandson is now at a good age to view it, we have this remastered 2disc 25th anniversary addition. I would also direct anyone of similar interest to volumes #13 of the graphic novels entitled Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal: Creation Myths. Conceptual designer Brian Froud is heavily involved, the imagery is awesome, and it offers the origin of Thra before the events depicted in the film. A second wave of books entitled Shadows of the Dark Crystal are due out this summer.

For what its worth, the following details are basically what Amazon has advertised with a couple minor adjustments.

Disc One:
* New High Definition Film Transfer
* New Commentary by Brian Froud

Disc Two:
* Original Making of Documentary The World of the Dark Crystal
* Deleted Scenes
* Work Print Scenes
* Character Drawings
* Reflections of the Dark Crystal: Light on the Path of Creation & Shard of Illusion  Two AllNew behindthescenes documentaries that include rediscovered footage from the Henson archives and newly recorded interviews with the people who created The Dark Crystal.

NOW, I'm a huge movie buff and I love me some cheesy 80s flicks that are so bad they are great, but I couldn't sit through 10 minutes of this garbage. I even read through some of these reviews and saw someone actually said the only movie that compared to this in greatness was ""Avatar"" from James Cameron.. HAHAHA.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!

I didn't have the DVD to compare it to, but I don't know how much difference there is in picture quality between DVD and Blu-Ray.

570997,5,6303122876,"This film is far from being just a kid's fairy tale. It is about the ancient theme of restoring harmony to a shattered world, and the hero's journey. It starts with a mysterious castle at the centre of a wasteland (rather like the romances of the Holy Grail), which contains a crystal that supplies power to its rulers, the cruel Skeksis. But the crystal is missing a piece and hence its power is a source of disharmony. The hero, Jen, must restore the missing shard and restore wholeness to the world.

The treatment of  good and evil is also more sophisticated than in a fairy story. The Mystics who raise Jen are like Buddhist or Jain monks, wise and good and benevolent, but incapable of action. They cannot be a positive force for good in the world, because they are withdrawn from it. On the other hand the Skeksis are active and knowledgeable but only in the pursuit of power. They are unrestrained by wisdom or morality. Asceticism and depravity are different sides of the same coin. When the crystal is finally restored, the matter is resolved in a quite unexpected way.

The movie may be a bit too dark for younger children, but otherwise all age groups should enjoy it.",1441411200,,1180,4.5829383886255926

571123,5,6303122876,"This classic Jim Henson film from 1981 is now on blu-ray, much better than the 2 disc dvd set
brilliantly Directed by Puppeteer master Jim Henson & some scenes are also directed by Frank oz
the creature effects still look amazing today, of course back in the early 80's no computer effects were available
so the puppeteers had to make lots of amazing effort to make the characters seem real
especially the 2 Gelfling characters and it definitely shows on the screen for sure
this film is Definitely a treasure that will stand the test of time

Sony pictures who owns the rights to this classic film have now released it on blu-ray
with a new HD transfer & i tell you what the picture quality looks very sharp & clear for sure in 2:35:1 ratio
plus the sound quality has been boosted to a new 5.1 Master audio mix which does sound better than the Dolby digital mix
it does not stop there
all the special features from the 2 Disc dvd set have been carried over
REFLECTIONS OF THE DARK CRYSTAL-2parts to this
1st is LIGHT ON THE PATH OF CREATION-36mins which is a retrospective making of featurette
interviews with screenplay writer David Odell, conceptual Designer Brian froud and
Kathryn mullen who was the puppeteer for one of the Gelflings-Kira
the other Gelfling Jen was puppeteered by Jim Henson himself who also shared the Directing with Frank OZ
some other behind the scenes crew are also interviewed
but sadly producer Gary kurtz or Frank oz are not interviewed
2nd part is SHARD OF ILLUSION which is about the filming & shooting of the Dark crystal
so about 1 hour of new interviews that could be played continously
but for some reason are split into 2 featurettes
plus the TV broadcast Doco from the early 80's called the World of the Dark crystal
which of course has on the set interviews with Jim Henson, Frank oz, Kathryn mullen & other crew
this TV Doco has been Digitally remastered in 1:33:1 ratio
so it's of course better clearer picture quality than VHS
there's also Deleted scenes, original theatrical trailer
plus 2 new Blu-ray exclusives-the Book of Thra- Dark crystal collector
skektek's crystal challenge, and picture in picture storyboard track
all this on 1 blu-ray Disc, incredible!
definitely time to upgrade
5 stars for this new blu-ray",1436486400,,2261,4.709595959595959

It lacked character and just about a very bland plot.  I would not recommend this movie to children under 8 yrs  old.  I know,  a lot of people loved this movie,  but thanks no thanks.  If you are planning to purchase this movie,  rent it first and see how you will like it.

All the complicated storytelling devices aside, its a great movie for kids and adults alike. There's sure to be something for everyone to enjoy. I will say that its definitely a little dated, as in the acting and humor -Keeping in mind that this is a Henson production- so don't expect too much in terms of spectacular acting.",1400716800,,632,4.319327731092437

However there are two main flaws that could have been fixed.  First is the expression of the main characters, especially the gelflings.  I seen Henson's creatures do so well with the expressions with the Muppets, even the secondary characters of this movie had great expressions, but the main characters were so lifeless.  The second main flaw was the script and exposition, it didn't work.  I had heard rumors that the original version of the movie did not have narration.

572741,5,6303122876,"This is one of my favorite ""kids' movies"" of all time.  The puppetry and design was masterful, the story creative.  That the team could draw such emotional response from the audience while using puppetry is phenomenal.  Certain characters are unforgettable:  Fizzgig (gotta love the tantrum scene), the evil Skeksis, Augrha and of course the Gelflings.

""Of course not.  You're a boy"" is one of my favorite unexpected movie lines.

Conceptualized by the great Brian Froud and brought to life by Jim Henson and Frank Oz, this is one of puppetry's finest moments. In no other movie have we seen such a diverse set of puppetry, ranging from muppet-like podlings to the full body suits of the Land Striders.  This is the art at its finest; nothing less would be expected from this team.

Some aspects of the film may be too scarey for very young children.  But for a child old enough to discern fantasy from reality-- and any adult who is still young at heart-- this movie is a gourmet presentation on all levels.",1392508800,,1009,4.714285714285714

574699,5,6303122876,"Dear Movie Appreciators,

I've seen THE DARK CRYSTAL several times over the last thirty years or so (wow, am I really that old?) but it has been several years since my last viewing  I pulled out my trusty old VHS copy that had been recorded from HBO in about 1984, hoping to interest my son in something from my childhood, and was amazed at the terrible sound and picture quality - we could only watch about 30 min. or so before giving up - I should have known though.  I guess this is one I had just never taken the time to upgrade - funny to think that people might still be popping in old tapes from the 80'sbut it was fun skipping all the technological advances over the years and jumping from 80's home recording right to Amazon HD quality with the flexibility to play the movie across so many devices, including our TV.

The movie look great and sounds great in HD.  It's nice to now be able to match the idealized memories in my head with the reality of seeing the movie again 30 years after it came out.

After reading Jim Henson's biography I felt like I had a better appreciation for the significance of this film both in the context of its release date, and many years later.  There's a quote from someone in the book saying something about how the movie will likely always have historical importance as it is and always will be the only big budget feature length motion picture where everything we see on the screen is hand made.

Henson's biographer (Brian Jay Jones) also explored the theme of Jim Henson often being more concerned with how a movie looked visually than the story and characters, and would build movies beginning with a visual concept rather than with a story.  This proves true in The Dark Crystal, where the story and characters may have some weak spots but the whole movie is still exciting and interesting to look at, even after all this time.

I've also been interested to learn that Henson originally had the Skeksis and The Mystics speaking their own language without subtitles, but decided to add English dialogue later after negative reactions in test screenings.  It would be fascinating to see the film as he originally intended, and had Jim Henson lived into the age of the DVD and Blue Ray I'm sure he would have had lots of bonus features to give us.  Nothing extra with this particular version - perhaps other DVD or Blue Ray versions?

Sincerely,

Constant Viewer",1385337600,,2409,4.533487297921478

The concepts of duality, good vs bad, greed and waste vs kindness and conservation abound in this movie. Now that I have watched DC again after so many years I noticed themes like the elite Skexis being willing to steal ""vital life essence"" from the smaller beings to make themselves young which kind of reminds me of how our elite today abuse collagen or their apparent abuse of their environment which left the landscape around their dwelling barren, Gluttony, competition, and hunger for power are also shown. That the two races, one peaceful and one cruel and barbaric came from one and are still connected is another great theme. The many uses for crystals was not so commonly known when this movie was released as it is today esp. for technology like the crystal bats and our growing understanding of our planets and universe. I know many adults who loved this movie as much younger adults. The puppets still manage to pull off a lot of emotion and each character is complete. This is not Sci-Fi meets Sesame Street.

575187,3,6303122876,"I first saw this film in a theater the day after Christmas, 1982.  I was so captivated by it that I saw it again a month later.  Unfortunately, subsequent viewings have worn off much of the fascination.  My admiration still remains with Brian Froud's marvelous designs, less so the story and its characters.  By its own admission, the story is only concerned with the dark crystal, the 3 suns, and the shard all getting together on a certain day, there is very little elaboration beyond that.  The quest for the shard is limited, the interchange between characters sporadic.  On the whole, this is a dry and joyless film.  It doesn't say much that the only well-thought out characters are buzzard-like creatures in fancy dress (the best of the lot being the whimpering chamberlain).  The rest are `sculptures' that move.  The Gelflings in particular are very expressionless (like plastic dolls).  Speaking of Yoda, Aughra is a poor substitute.  Again Yoda, when Jen's master is truly dead then gone, this smacks of plagiarism.  Also when a Skeksis cries out, ""feel the power of the Dark Crystal!""  The Force is not with this one.

Dark, grim, and way too somber, this is a sad piece I'm not sure I'd care to see again.",1371254400,,1218,4.738095238095238
575188,2,6303122876,"Here's the elephant in the room about  this movie: It's boring. It's technically masterful and wonderfully-crafted, but part of the reason why nobody really remembers it is that for all of that work, it just isn't all that interesting. And as an adult, I find much of it to be a bit silly: lots of effort coming up with a ton of goofy species, both in name and in design. Ridiculous fake languages. It's hard for me to fathom that scores of children would take an interest in it because it is so dry (and dark). A somber child might. But this movie tries awfully hard to be philosophical and misses a chance to be thrilling, endearing, or captivating. The only character who you really care anything about is Fizzgig, the furry dog-like creature. And he can't even talk.

The reason for this is revealed in time. However we are concerned with a Gelffling that was charged with either healing the world or letting it live in evil for all time.

This is a classic movie that can almost be placed in the cult class. I have watched several media versions and can say this is one film that is actually enhanced by the Blu-ray treatment.  True the acting is the same and the story is the same. But the visuals and music, which are equal partners with the rest of the characters, are more intense.

Watching the Blu-ray extras, the voice over by conceptual designer Brian Froud, who also did the voice over for ""Labyrinth"", we find that the title of this film might have been ""Dark Chrysalis"" as it is a movie about change.

Take hart that they did not place a lot of coming attractions at the front of the DVD and that the Blu-ray extras sill do not get in the way of the film as some do.

575320,5,6303122876,"Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.

But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in ""The Dark Crystal,"" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.

On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.

The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?

Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in ""The Dark Crystal"" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.

Instead of some pan-medieval land, ""The Dark Crystal"" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. ""The Dark Crystal"" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.

Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.

At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (""Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!"") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.

""The Dark Crystal"" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.",1365206400,2,3742,5.163366336633663

The story follows the adventure of the Gelfling Jen, the last of his race. The Gelflings vanished because the Skeksis have wiped them out. A thousand years ago, the Dark Crystal was broken and a prophecy was made that a Gelfling would repair the crystal and end the rule of the Skeksis. At the same time as the Skeksis appeared, the Mystics also appeared. They lived peaceably and humbly far from the Skeksis. They too know of the prophecy, and one of them saved Jen when his village was attacked. Now that the three suns are about to come in alignment again, the leader of the Mystics sends Jen on a mission to get the missing shard and fulfill the prophecy.

The story follows Jen through the amazing world that Henson and Oz (creators of The Muppets) have created. And, to be honest, the real charm of the film is exploring their creativity rather than unpacking their mythology. Jen wanders through swamps, forests, and hillsides, finding amazing flora and fauna. He arrives at the home of Aughra, a Keeper of Secrets. She has a gigantic clock-work universe in her lab, showing the motion of stars, planets, and moons. It is still amazing to see 30 years later, as is the wide variety and sizes of puppets they use. The mythology is interesting enough but not particularly profound or original. It has the standard good-versus-evil elements along with the hero's journey to save the world.

The storytelling suffers a little bit from too many voice-overs, especially hearing Jen's thoughts, which seem obvious from what we see on the screen. Maybe the voice-overs were added for the children in the audience to help them interpret what's going on. The movie might be too scary for younger children. I was eleven when I saw it in the theater and was okay, but I don't think we'll be showing it to Jacob or Lucy (5- and 3-years old as I write) for a couple of years.",1360108800,,2132,4.532467532467533

575407,5,6303122876,"Somewhere, in a world beyond imagination, a young Gelfling sets off on a perilous quest to save his dying planet by returning a missing shard to the planet's power source: The Dark Crystal. An evil race of bird-like creatures known as the Skekses look to stop Jen, but with the help of his newfound friends, he will gather the strength and courage needed to overcome all obstacles and free the world from their tyranny! THE DARK CRYSTAL is one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments achieved through the combined talents of Jim Henson and Frank Oz. It is the first feature film to be constructed out of an entirely inhuman cast, using the advanced methods of animatronics and puppetry that the directors helped to conceive throughout the late 70's. With the help of artist Brian Froud, this creative team has developed a fantasy world unlike any other, complete with its own unique creatures and wondrous landscapes. It is, however, a dark and terrifying film as well, much unlike the cheerful children's programs for which the directors had previously been known. Along with LABYRINTH and THE NEVERENDING STORY, THE DARK CRYSTAL is a cult classic when it comes to dark Children's Fantasy and Horror.

575411,5,6303122876,"A memorable favorite and unique for having no humans in it, with all characters being puppets.

The story is set on a fantasy world with 3 suns and a powerful magical crystal.  A thousand years before the beginning of the movie and story, the 3 suns came together in a great conjunction, and a powerful race known as the UrSkeks harnessed the combined light of the suns and the crystal in an attempt to burn out all impurity and perfect themselves.  Things go awry, the Crystal cracks, and the UrSkeks vanish.  In their stead two new races arise, the Skeksis and the Mystics or UrRu.

The Skeksis inherit the passion and will of the UrSkeks, but lack wisdom and compassion, and they take control of the Castle of the Crystal.  They maintain their power and longevity by draining the land of life and taking slaves.  When a prophecy is made that their rule would be ended by the elfin race of Gelflings, they killed all the Gelflings they could find in an attempt to thwart the prophecy.

The Mystics inherit the wisdom of the UrSkeks but lack will and drive.  They leave the Castle of the Crystal and settle far away in a secluded valley where they live in isolation, practicing their nature magics.  However due to their flawed nature, they remain isolationist and do little outside their valley.

The movie begins shortly before the next great conjunction of suns.  Both the Skeksis and Mystics have dwindled to 10 each.  The Mystics have taken in a Gelfling orphan, named Jen, and the story begins with him being given the task of fulfilling the prophecy.

The puppetry in the movie is amazing for its time, given how they are all alien characters, from the birdlike Skeksis to the four armed Mystics.  The storyline though seemingly simplistic good vs. evil borrows thematically from Eastern notions of balance and harmony rather than straightforward Manichean opposed dualities.

It is a dark movie as there are frightening monsters and scenes about death in it, but I think this does not make it inappropriate for children.  Children very quickly learn that the world is not all light and goodness, and trying to ""protect"" them by preventing them from seeing anything else does them a disservice.",1359072000,,2202,4.7678100263852246

So - here, instead of a barrel chested half-naked barbarian, the main hero is Jen, a Gelfling, a pixish diminutive being with delicate face, orphaned in his early childhood and raised by a race of benevolent ancient creatures, the Mystics. One day, when Jen is already a young adult, he is told, that he was chosen to accomplish a great mission - he is the one and the only one who can save the world...

Begins an incredibly perilous journey, during which he will meet a fair maiden Gelfling, find a magic item of major importance, face monsters and traitors and ultimately go to the fortress of evil, where dwells hideous Skeksis... who are desperate to catch Jen, but really not to hug him...

Well, this is the same story we all saw already dozens of time - but this one has some unique features. First - all the characters are puppets, marionettes, etc. and still look really great, even in our time of CG special effects. The music is very impressive. The vision of the world is totally unique - nothing familiar for us, Earthlings, it is clear that this story is happening long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...

The girl Gelfling is possibly one of the sweetest creatures I ever saw - she is clearly a fairy princess (and she will prove it at a moment in the movie). Jen is a very kind and quiet hero, but definitely not a whimp - and his noble attitude will impress the most hardened hearts... In one word, this movie is a monument of cinema!

For those who do not yet own a Blu-Ray player - or do not want to watch this streaming - I offer this DVD review of the ""25th Anniversary Edition.""

The Story Of The Film:  A thousand years ago on a world very different from our own, the titular crystal was shattered and two races appeared: the evil and ambitious Skeksis and the good but lethargic Mystics.  A prophecy however, tells that a member of the race of Gelflings will return a broken shard to the Dark Crystal and end the Skeksis' reign of terror.  Naturally, the Skeksis wage a war of genocide, wiping out the entire Gelfling race... or so they think.  In order to keep the prophecy alive (and get this movie past the opening credits) the Mystics rescue a Gelfling child, Jen, and raise him until the day he can set off on his quest to heal the Dark Crystal.  On this quest Jen (and the viewer) will discover that he may not be the last of his kind after all, that the Skeksis and the Mystics are connected in a vital way, and that puppetry - even the wizardly puppetry of Jim Henson - can only go so far.

When this film came out in 1982 it was very ambitious: it has no human characters and all of the characters that are in it are played by puppets (basically... more on that below).  It is set on an alien world - there are few points of reference for the viewer.  The main protagonists are humanoid, but the other creatures are some of the strangest you'll see in a fantasy film.  The technical challenges to pull this off were staggering, and the result is very unique and certainly watch-able, but very mixed.  The main appeal of ""The Dark Crystal"" is visual - this film is gorgeous.  Henson and company really have created a whole other wondrous world on the screen, thanks mainly to Conceptual Designer Brian Froud.  Froud supplied the initial drawings and visual ideas to Henson and co-director Frank Oz who then collaborated to put them in their finished form on celluloid.  This movie has its own mood... a weird, funky vibe.  It can also be beautiful to behold - long shots of the Castle of the Crystal or of the traveling Mystics come to mind. The creatures themselves are (mostly) also wonderful to behold.  For the most part, they do not seem like puppets but like real, breathing creatures (I'll get to the exception in a bit).  The Mystics (four-armed lizard things) and the Skeksis (dinosaur-buzzard things) come off better than today's CGI creations... you forget that they are puppets and accept them as characters.  Of the other characters, Aughra, the Old Wise Woman (every fantasy movie requires by federal law an Old Wise Man/Woman character) comes off the best, although this is no surprise seeing as Frank Oz (who plays Aughra) was responsible for Yoda from ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  Speaking of which, as I was watching this, I swore that I recognized the voice of the Dying Emperor... turns out that he was played by Jerry Nelson, who did Skred from those Muppet segments in the early days of Saturday Night Live.  So there's your trivia for the day... and now you'll never be able to watch The Dark Crystal without expecting Chevy Chase to show up.

For all of its good points this film has a major flaw, and that is its two leads: Jen and Kira, the Gelflings.  Unfortunately they are dull characters, and have almost no personality.  This is obviously a problem, as these are the protagonists of the movie and thus take up a lot of screen time.  I felt that even the cute sidekick dog character (""Fizzgig The Friendly Monster"") was more interesting and had more personality than these two.  It also doesn't help that the Gelflings are not convincing; you always feel that you are watching puppets.  The problem is that they are the most humanoid creatures in the piece - we the viewers expect them do look human and act in a humanlike way.  Jen and Kira though do not move in a convincing human manner or look detailed enough - they move and look like puppets.  Another problem is that in some of the long shots of Jen running, climbing, etc an obviously human double is used.  The contrast between the human movements in long-shot and the puppet movements in close-up are very jarring.  The makers of this movie should have just used human actors for these roles.

For this ""25th Anniversary Edition"", ""The Dark Crystal"" is presented anamorphically in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The picture is very good for a film made in the 1980s: there is little grain and no evident damage (scratches, etc.).  Subtitles are provided in English, French and Japanese.  On the sound front, this movie is presented in Dolby 5.1 and sounds adequate.  The music certainly sounds very good (the Trevor Jones score for this film is excellent) but the dialogue and sound are just a little on the flat side (but this probably just the limitations of the source material).  On an interesting note, a Japanese audio track is provided... you should listen to this at least once, it's a hoot!  Since all the players are puppets its syncs up surprisingly well, and the voices actually sound appropriate to their characters!

The extras for this 2-disc edition include a Making-Of documentary entitled ""The World of the Dark Crystal"", two self-congratulatory ""reflections"", a deleted scene, work print scenes, character illustrations and previews for other Henson products.  ""The World of the Dark Crystal"" is a TV documentary from the time the movie was produced and is very informative as to how it was made.  It really is fascinating to see how Henson et al created this.  The two ""reflection"" pieces ""Light on the Path of Creation"" and ""Shard of Illusion,"" are not really that essential, as they basically contain the people who made the film waxing on about how good their creation is and going off like high school English teachers on the symbolism and themes of the movie.  The deleted scene is superfluous and one can see why it was left out of the final film; the ""work print"" scenes are a selection of scenes from the movie as it originally sounded - the Skeksis speak in their own language and the voices for some of the other characters sound different.  Worth viewing once. Also included on the movie disc is an audio commentary by Brian Froud.  This commentary contains the same information as the making of documentaries though, so you really don't have to listen to it. In fact, I'm baffled as to why it's included.

Looking on Amazon at the various versions of this movie (most are now out-of-print, including this) I can say that this is no great upgrade to previous DVD editions (although I am not sure about the video and audio, as I have not seen any of the previous discs).  This version lacks the theatrical trailers and isolated music track of the previous single disc edition and the content new to this edition (the commentary and new ""retrospectives"") are not earth-shattering or essential.  The current Blu-Ray release has all of the features of this and more, plus (presumably, I do not have it) better video and audio.  Buy this only if you do not have a Blu-Ray player and want ""The Dark Crystal"" on DVD.",1351296000,,7276,4.64609375

Quite well done for 1982 - it's always intriguing to watch old movies and see how special effects were like back then.

The cracking of the dark crystal leads to two races appearing - the evil Skeksis and gentle Mystics. Jen, the gelfling, adopted by the Mystics is sent on a quest to find the missing shard of the dark crystal after his Mystic master dies.

The characters aren't developed much, the scripting is dull and the presentation is so, so slow.  My son couldn't relate to the narrative factor, asking mainly ""when are the characters going to actually talk?""  I was bored to sleep, literally on several occasions during the movie, and by the time it ended, I was relieved that the whole event was finally over.  My wife's one comment after sitting through the movie was ""well, that was just horrid.""  So, what in the heck do the other reviewers see in this clunker?

575644,3,6303122876,"Do you enjoy the puppets used in the classic Muppet films but wish they had a darker story line?  Well look no further that The Dark Crystal.  KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna Noone shares her review of the film below:
This is a Jim Henson film that stars Jim Henson as Jen, Kathryn Mullen as Kira and David Goelz as Fizzgig. This movie is about an elf-like gelfling who is sent by his dying master to find a shard from a broken lamp that will help restore the balance in his universe. This gelfling's name is Jen, and Jen  has some troubles along the way. First off, he has the shard but doesn't know what to do with it. Also the skeksis are trying to kill him so that the prophecy can't be fulfilled and the skeksis can live forever. However, Jen gets some help from Kira, the only other gelfling alive, and the animals from the forest, where the witch Kira lives. I think that the puppets they use are very well designed and detailed so much so that they have anthropomorphic qualities. The cinematography is considered to be cutting edge for this movie, but could have been better, as some scenes in the movie you can see the wires on the puppets. My favorite characters are Kira and Fizzgig, Kira's pet. I like Kira because she is brave and determined to protect Jen. I like Fizzgig because he is loyal to Kira and protective of her. Also even when Fizzgig does not want to do something he still does it when Kira asks him to. My favorite scene is when Kira and Jen touch hands and share their memory with one another. I like these scenes because it is kind of the podlings to share their village with a stranger and because I dislike the scenes that are rude and/or cruel. The puppeteering is phenomenal as expected from Jim Henson.  I hope you guys out there enjoy this movie. I think that this film is for ages 8 to 14, because these aren't your normal Jim Henson puppets, and the dark story line may be too much for young children.  Overall, I rate this film 3 out of 5 stars because while it was well done, the darker storyline just isn't for me.",1343952000,,2056,4.32987012987013

""The Dark Crystal"" is a movie about a Gelfling named Jen who needs to restore the Dark Crystal to end the rule of the evil Skeksis.  I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  It had a good story, and it had a very magical feel to it.  I also thought the design for the characters were great.  There was a lot of creativity put into this movie.  The movie was a bit dark, but I personally like dark movies.  (Scared me as a little kid, though.)

As for the extras, much of it wasn't anything special.  Deleted scenes (that were boring and bad quality), trailers.  The best thing was the video on the making of the movie, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  All the characters in the movie are puppets, and it was interesting seeing how they did everything.

(The reviews here seem to be about several versions of the movie.  I'm talking about the regular DVD version.  Not Collector's Edition or any of that.)",1343520000,,1009,4.349462365591398
575646,2,6303122876,"Having been impressed by Labrynth, I decided to watch one of Henson's other less-watched films; the Dark Crystal, knowing almost nothing about it, except that it was a fantasy film about characters in a world full of strange creatures.  It sounded, from this alone, like something I would like.  You see, I'm a big lover of fantasy stories of all types.

The premise of this movie is that in another world, there is a crystal, which seems to influence the wellbeing of the planet and its people.  The crystal cracked, and this led, apparently, to an evil race, named the skeksis, seizing power over it.  They use it, along with their scouts, the crystal bats, and their shock troops; the insectoid Garthim, to enforce a rein of terror over all the less powerful races.  Meanwhile, a race of mystics have been raising a young gelfling (like an elf with only eight fingers and a very low nose,) for his destiny of fulfilling a prophecy; recovering the lost shard of the crystal and returning it to where it belongs, thus robbing the skeksis of their power.  The Gelfling's name is Jen.  In his quest to restore the crystal to its true form, Jen meets up with a female Gelfling named Kira, and her furball Fizzgig, all of them having lost loved ones to the skeksis, and eager to put an end to their reign.

Done right, this could be a charming story about grief, redemption and love.  However, this movie is not done right.  For one thing, neither of the two main characters seems to have much of any personality to them.  They exist to assist in the story, and their backgrounds consist of a series of loose associations and talents.  They're both about as bland as can be, and not much of anything is ever learned about them.  This is the first big problem I had with the film.  It gets caught up in its alien worldbuilding and odd visuals, and forgets that it's supposed to be telling a story here.

The second big problem with this movie, and for me, the most serious, is that the whole thing, from start to finish, is essentially one long piece of new age propaganda.  I've seen signs of this is Henson's work before, but never to this degree.  The prominence of the crystal, the sorcery of the mystics, the dream-sharing between the Gelflings, the poor understanding of the relationship between body and soul demonstrated by the movie's ending (in which people essentially merge into one another,) the clear failure to grasp what an ""essence"" is, and finally, the bunk new age ideology spouted by the shimmering aliens at the end about how ""we are all one.""  This type of thing alone is enough to turn me off to the film.

There's also a not-very-forgivable scene of the two gelflings sleeping together in the woods.  Granted, they are essentially puppets, but the whole movie takes itself so seriously, that I have no doubt what this was meant to convey.

If it seems like I'm complaining a lot about this film considering the grade I gave it, this is only because I really did appreciate some of the worldbuilding, scenery and creative creatures that Henson and Company came up with for this flick.  They're very beautiful, visually-impressive, and they capture the imagination, but it's not worth putting up with the problems this film has.",1343088000,2,3246,4.656140350877193

575652,5,6303122876,"Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.

But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in ""The Dark Crystal,"" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.

On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.

The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?

Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in ""The Dark Crystal"" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.

Instead of some pan-medieval land, ""The Dark Crystal"" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. ""The Dark Crystal"" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.

Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.

At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (""Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!"") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.

""The Dark Crystal"" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.",1331683200,,3742,5.163366336633663

When I saw it again, it was still good, but not -- I don't know -- magic.  Probably more a fault of my age than of the movie.

575740,5,6303122876,"I am not a big fan of fantasy movies, the type that portray fairies and elves and such creatures.  However, I remember seeing this movie as a child as being sort of my first horror movie experience with the grotesque Skeksis creatures.  Seeing it today brings back many memories, but the special features make it a truly educational let alone entertaining experience, seeing where we were and where we are now.

On a fictional planet, the Skeksis rule their planet with an iron fist with their evil and draining the world of all it has to offer.  Only a few remain, having been split in half into their evil (Skeksis) and good (Mystics) sides when the crystal cracked.  According to myth and legend, only a Gelfling (an elflike creature), is capable of restoring the crystal by replacing the missing shard.  The Skeksis have long since exterminated this race of creature to ensure their power.  However, one lone Gelfling boy named Jen was rescued by a Mystic and raised alone in their valley.  While on his deathbed, his master Mystic tells him of his quest that he must fulfill.  So Jen embarks on the quest to replace the shard of the Dark Crystal, meeting another surviving Gelfling (Kira) who also survived the extermination of the Skeksis, and restore good to their world.

Seeing a movie like this is rather surprising today, considering that it took five years to complete it.  Today everything is all digital, but in those days it was all by hand of complex puppets, make up, costume design, and landscapes.  The special features are of great detail of how they came up with the story, designing the sets and elaborate costumes.  Sometimes we forget just how hard people work at these things and how far we have come in order to make these outstanding creatures.  Also, as the Skeksis and all things within their castle are so hideous and ugly, this was a true visual horror movie.  It was quite a departure from Jim Henson's previous works with the Muppets (even though that was/is what he is most famous for).  Today kids may not quite understand what is going on, as these things were done by hand rather than with CGI, but it was more of an appreciation for how movie magic is made today.",1311465600,,2201,4.648578811369509

The Blu-Ray transfer is beautiful.  Textures and fine details are amazing and a feast for the eyes, though one might think glaringly so since whatever flaws there are do become more apparent (the skin of the Gelfling has an almost felt-like appearance).  There are a couple of ""defects"" but it is obvious they are from the original print (special effects were not as advanced as they are today).  Nonetheless, Henson created a very rich environment for his characters and that environment comes-out in spectacular detail.

The sound, sadly, is marginally improved.  It still has the compressed quality (particularly noticeable over the End Credits) of the original Dolby Stereo.  It doesn't mean they did nothing.  The voices, particularly of the Urskeks at the end, for example, are much clearer and improved.  I did not find myself straining to figure-out what the characters were saying like I had to in the video.

If you are interested in the movie and story, you will not be disappointed.  If you are a fan of Special Features, you will be.  There are 2 or 3 (can't remember) documentaries/featurettes missing from this release that were included in the DVD version(s): Reflections of the Dark Crystal and, at least, one other.  This is a Blu-Ray disc with 25 GB of space.  Even with the HD transfer, there would have been enough room to include those behind-the-scenes features.  Plus, the deleted scene is missing, also.

Some of the voices also seem a bit weak and lighty for their characters.

I'm still not crazy about Jen's voice acting or dialogue, but the rest of the characters really do grow on you. Also, I love how the plot goes into dark places and avoids a typical Hollywood ending. My guess is that this is still - and will remain - the only live-action movie shot without people on screen and for that alone it's worth preserving for posterity.",1278892800,,1772,5.374100719424461

575872,5,6303122876,"The timeless excellence of this fantasy classic has been well-described over the decades, so instead this quick little review will just make notes regarding the recent blu-ray incarnation.

Put simply, the film overall looks incredibly sharp, colorful, and vibrant.  Swords gleam with the sharpest of edges, the most exquisite details of the often ornate clothing become clear, forests burst in luxuriant green.  The age of the film is still treated with appropriate respect, as film grain can be seen in wider outside daytime shots that always make it more visible, as well as occasional flat grey-suffused zones where background art was later overlaid.  I can't imagine a better balance in bringing an older movie to--not just adequate, but top-flight--blu-ray quality while staying so true to the original state.

Audio is also nicely improved in terms of clarity for the blu-ray, though there is less opportunity for improvement here than for the visuals.  In addition, a great many welcome extras complete the package.  Highlights from the past include the nearly one-hour archival documentary ""The World of the Dark Crystal"", an aged but still entertaining and thorough look behind the scenes of the original film production.

Finally, there are a few blu-ray specific extras.  Best of these is the superb ""Storyboard Track - Picture-in-Picture"" function, wherein panels will pop onscreen (such as ""Concept Art - The Castle of the Crystal"") to provide background info or concept art for immediate comparison to the currently playing scene.",1269734400,9,1545,5.325102880658436

575940,4,6303122876,"This is another retro-review featuring movies/DVDs that have been out for quite some time but I have never critiqued. This one I recently revisited for the first time since its' first release in theatres back in /82;and gladly it has not lost any of its'power to fascinate.
Inspired by fantasy characters from the works of Brian Stroud,Henson came up with a plot which involves the Crystal of Truth. The Urskeks were once the guardians of this huge crystal but cracked it,thus splitting their race into the gentle Mystics and the evil Skeksis(symbolic of the evil/good in all creatures).
The Skeksis are large,ugly bird like creatures who rely on the power of the now Dark Crystal to dominate their world. However prophecies fortell of a Gelfling who is to recover the broken shard from the broken Crystal of Truth and restore the Urskeks race. The Skeksis try to make sure this never happens,but fate is in motion and a Gelfling by the name of Jen is the chosen one. Along his journey he meets another Gelfling(elf-eared creatures),called Kira. The knowledge of one compliments the other and together they journey back to the Dark Crystal and restore the shard and the Urskek race.
A totally engaging and imaginative tale,The Dark Crystal was a perfect vehicle in which Henson would display his numerous talents as a puppeteer. As the founding father of the Muppets,he and his close collaborator Frank Oz created a unique world here and the myriad of creatures brought to life on screen,big and small,is astounding. For instance,watch the scene where Jen is sitting in the swamp. As the camera pans left to right watch for all the critters that emphasize just how alive the swamp really is. And little touches like Kira's dog when it barks/whines when it fears it's getting left behind;very visible are its' tonsils. The details make the film that much more enjoyable,and Henson was a stickler for details.
The picture was produced with the minimum of computer help. While his Labyrinth was mostly humans,humans in costume and muppets,The Dark Crystal features mostly men in costumes and muppets,no humans. It was quite an undertaking but Henson pulled it off brilliantly. Henson left us too soon and it makes you wonder just how much he would have been able to accomplish with today's technology had he survived.
As an aside I do not know if this is the original print of the movie. I seem to recall that some creatures spoke their own language and it was subtitled. I recall that that slowed the pace of the movie somewhat but this print actually enhances it without it so,unusually,I'm not complaining. Although it would be nice to have the original print and this one to compare them.
Technically the back jacket on this particluar release(2005) says it has been mastered in Hi-Def but the print,while clear,still shows a little too much dirt specs. A recent remastered release is much better picture wise but it lacks all the special features existing on this release. Those include a documentary on the films making,deleted funeral scenes,original language work print scenes,drawings and profiles and the original trailer. Maybe one day they will release all of these features on one disc.
For now however this film/DVD is certainly a keeper. This wonderful film will amuse and facinate both the young and young at heart. While we have relatively little of puppet master Henson's works on celluloid,there is much to savour in every one of his works and The Dark Crystal is no exception.",1258156800,2,3493,4.932088285229202

575942,5,6303122876,I never realised it took five years to make this movie. Puppets and scenes hand made not computer generated. Worth the money.,1257379200,,125,4.7272727272727275
575943,5,6303122876,"Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.

But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in ""The Dark Crystal,"" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.

On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.

The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?

Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in ""The Dark Crystal"" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.

Instead of some pan-medieval land, ""The Dark Crystal"" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. ""The Dark Crystal"" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.

Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.

At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (""Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!"") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.

""The Dark Crystal"" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.",1257292800,,3742,5.163366336633663

This BluRay is basically identical to the DVD version in every respect aside from the movie itself being higher resolution.

575946,5,6303122876,"Loved watching this film repeatedly as a teen when it came out. The Blu did not disappoint in any way.

The preservation came across in as good a light as could be with so many sets. The colors shined through beautifully in some of the exteriors and CGI landscapes. The garden sequences looked great, as did even some of the simpler things like the sand of the Mystics. The big test for me was the outlined exteriors where either Mystics or those walkers were set against the sky - it all looked good; the majority of the artifact and grain was gone. The sound was fine and really the only fault I saw right away was the credits vibrating with the film, otherwise the screenings have impressed everyone with the vibrancy and clarity all these years later.

The supplements include the array from prior releases with some complicated new ones, including:
* Book of Thra Dark Crystal Collector. A slide show intro gives the viewer instructions on how to use your four color buttons to collect items as they highlight on the screen (during the film). As you collect them you can open a book that gives historical info/trivia on the item you select (history of the castle, crystal info, etc.) You can open this book and read the material while the film is running so about half of the screen can be taken up while both collecting and reading; all pop-up options are disabled though so you have to exit all of this to re-access everything else.
* Trivia Game. This was actually fun if you have seen the film recently or are a hardcore buff on the information, otherwise most everyone was failing it that tried while re-watching for the first time in a bit. The game art takes up the four corners of the screen with a score tally and question sheets that have multiple guess answers selectable with the four color buttons. Same issue with pop-up capability as you have to close the game and have your player re-start from prior spot in the film (mine took about 30 secs to reboot back into the film). Would be fun for one of those rainy days where you don't want to watch the film but it would will still be playing in the background (sounds, music).
* PiP Storyboard Track. Outside of the textual intro about the storyboard process/trivia, the PiP was disappointing. Mainly because they admit the majority of the boards no longer exist so it was done from memory, plus the box takes up a significant part of the screen during the film, so it did not entertain me that much.
* Intro by Screenwriter - I could not find this anywhere so can't fill you in.

The menus play nicely with the majority of options being presented on the same screen - clear pics and nice music score on them also. Overall, a great product on a wonderful film. Enjoy.",1254096000,7,2735,4.51008064516129

Review from: [...]

The first time I laid eyes on the film The Dark Crystal ,I was five years old. My Aunt took me to see it in the theater. It probably was one of the first films I saw in a theater. To make a long story short, I remember being bored with the film. That was the last time I saw it, until I got the Blu-ray Disc in the mail. Now, twenty-seven years later, here I sit in my living room watching it with my two and a half year old daughter. She walked away after the opening credits, but I was drawn in by how wonderful the disc looked and how great the story was.
  The Dark Crystal is a film about the cycle of life and Good vs. Evil and their connection to each other. In a dark place, a dying race of birdlike creatures called Skeksis are in power and are the keepers of the Dark Crystal which holds the key to the life of the planet on which they all live.  In a not-too-far village lives a race known as the Mystics. They, too, are a dying race, but they have raised a young Gelfling boy named Jen.  Jen is the only known member of his race left, as the Skeksis have killed all of his kind off. However, there is a prophecy that a Gelfing boy will find the crystal shard that has broken from the dark crystal and  bring order back to the planet. Jen soon learns that he is that person and, with the help of a female, Gelfing named Kira,  Jen will try against all odds to fulfill the prophecy and bring order to the planet.
  I never realized just how much The Dark Crystal really bought the world of puppets in film to life. Looking at the creatures in this film and the world in which they live, everything seems real even though it is fantasy. This film was the late Jim Henson's version of Lord of the Rings. It has a lot of detail and all the characters and creatures have their own unique personalities. The story and time in which it takes place is rooted with such deep historic overtones that you know that the story has a lot of history to it. The story is perfectly written, with the prefect balance of story and characters.
  The Dark Crystal is a film that was made with puppets in the lead roles, yet the effects look so good, one can almost believe that they are real beings. The universe in which the story takes place is full of so much life and detail. Every effect and set piece was made to really drag your mind into a world that looks and feel real. The effects in this film are so great for its time that it's one of those films that you know paved the way for other films that involved puppets and animatronics.
  The Blu-ray disc is filled with special features. There are original special features that are part of the DVD which include Commentary with Brian Froud, The World of The Dark Crystal Documentary, Reflections of The Dark Crystal: ""Light on the Path of Creation"" & ""Shard of Illusion"", Test Scenes of the original Skeeksis Language and Deleted scenes.  The All New Blu-ray features include The Book of Thra -Dark Crystal Collector, SkekTek's Crystal Challenge - Trivia Game, Picture in Picture Storyboard Track and introduction by screenwriter David Odell on the original Skeksis Language.
  Overall, The Dark Crystal is a great fantasy film.  The Blu-ray disc is not only packed with great features that tell you everything you need to know about the film, but the quality of sound and picture are top notch. Sony really did a great job putting this disc together as well as transferring the film to digital. The film really looks great in the Blu-ray format. If you were a fan of the film when it came out in 1982 or you discovered it as a grown-up on VHS or DVD; the Blu-ray disc is well worth the buy.",1253404800,12,3828,4.475574712643678

This is one of my all-time favorite works by these two artistic genuises and I'm excited to see it coming to Blu-Ray at last. Definitely a pre-order worthy of any Muppet and fantasy fan!

Having missed out on the majority of the 1980's fantasy flicks, for various reasons, I've been backfilling my knowledge in this area, with mixed results. I definitely enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan/dp/B0000VD12I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Sonja/dp/B0001Z37HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Sonja</a>&nbsp;was fun, but I wasn't sure what to expect from a ""kid's movie"" (as it was described to me) like Dark Crystal.

Dark Crystal is, in my opinion, a surprisingly good film, even watched 'for the first time' nearly thirty years after its debut. The plot is easy enough for a child to follow, but engaging enough to maintain an adult's interest. The idea that extreme good and extreme evil are two sides of the same coin is not a new one, but it is fascinating to explore the implications here.

The characters are vibrant and imaginative; I was thoroughly sucked in by the quiet and kind Mystics, the bickering and vicious Skeksis, and the plucky and hopeful Gelflings. The puppet-work here is truly superb and really makes the viewer reminiscent for the old days - they just don't do puppet work like this anymore. (And though I love CGI-Yoda battles as much as the next person, there's just something more `real' about the puppets, somehow.) Most appreciated of all, I was pleased and delighted to see that the heroine is - in many ways - even more capable and just as crucial to the fulfillment of the prophecy as our sweet Gelfling hero is. It is very nice to see a role for women in a fantasy movie that extends beyond ""needs rescuing"" or ""looks great in a chainmail bikini"".

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good fantasy film. There is some scary material here - such as the crystal that removes the ""life essence"" of the captives - but everything is put right in the end. I actually enjoyed Dark Crystal more than the more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-Ember/dp/B001LPWGBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of Ember</a>, and for a movie that is past its twenty-fifth anniversary mark, that's saying something.

575986,5,6303122876,"This film is one of my early memories, perhaps the first (coherent) memory I have of anything.  I remember suddenly being aware of fantastic, amazing creatures and scenes.  I'm sure this had an influence over my development.

This is not a stupid, immature kid movie.  It is filled with wonder, complexity and imagination.  At times, it has an almost Miyazaki atmosphere.  If there is any complaint, it is that the movie is too short.  It is interesting, amazing and startling.

The story centers on a Gelfling - which is an amazing looking elf like creature.  It is the task of the Gelfling to mend an object with mythic power known as the Dark Crystal.  Adults watching the film will soon catch on to what is happening.  The crystal was intentionally broken with supposedly good intentions.  It was an attempt to split apart the essence of a semi-divine entity so that it could be rid of its evil side.  However, it goes horribly wrong...

It is a film of contrasts and startling moments.  Beautiful elf creatures in fantasy settings clash with scenes of torture and vile totalitarian behavior.  Suddenly, the landscape itself could spring to life.  Amazing patterns reveal themselves on the walls and pillars.

This might be a stunning film - even a scary film - for a child used to the shallow, derivative, watered down (overprotective) garbage that is the usual kids fare these days (like a certain kind of derivative, lame and played out computer animated movie or its equivalent).  One thing is for sure though - after watching this for the first time in many, many years - The Dark Crystal is an absolute must see.

Then there was a supposed collector's edition released in 2002 I think and that version was literally a sour double dip. Also to add, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!.

If he doesn't get the shard to the main crystal in time the world will blow up. Although this movie could be watched by children, and enjoyed by them, I think it was mostly made for adult entertainment. There are a lot of adult concepts.

576037,5,6303122876,"AWESOME collector for the generation who grew up with the Muppets, no doubt.... However, this movie may need to be carefully reviewed by parents before young children watch it.
I was born in 1979, very young when The Dark Crystal was big. My mother watched EVERYTHING before she let me view any movie or TV show to understand the point that was trying to be made and whether she felt the subject matter was appropriate for me. (This is what parents SHOULD do). Instead of just thinking, 'Oh, Muppets... Jim Henson... Must be OK for her to watch,' she previewed it and was surprised by the angle of the film. Well, the angle of the Skeksis (sp.) anyway.
The idea of sucking out 'The Essence' of small, inferior creatures to maintain life and youth was a message my mother didn't want me to be exposed to. Now that I'm an adult, I don't believe I would want my kids to see the movie at a very young age for the same reason. Plus too, that part of the movie is kind of scary, you have to see it to know what I mean.
I don't take a single bit of credability away from Mr. Henson and his group. For that time, they did a tremendous job on the production of this film, considering what we know today about special effects and so on.
I love this movie, I recommend it to anyone ages 15 and up. And parents, PLEASE monitor what your children are viewing and use the ratings system, but most importantly, use your best judgement on what you feel you want your children to learn from the media. PLEASE WATCH RESPONSIBLY!!! May you rest in peace, Jim. You made my childhood a memorable one!",1228262400,,1579,4.337837837837838

576113,3,6303122876,"Dark Crystal
When I was younger, I had a chance to see this movie. Over the years, I forgot about it. I just happened to run across it at a department store a few weeks ago and my memory clicked back on. After reading through other reviews, I decided this puppet-filled fantasy flick would be worth the 9-dollar price tag. After this viewing of the film, I felt disappointed. At the same time, I enjoyed the concept of the film.

A thousand years ago, the Dark Crystal was broken. Upon the Crystal being broken, two new races appear. One race is the gentle, slow moving Mystics. The other race is the evil Skeksis. The Skeksis have control over the Dark Crystal and use it to reign supreme in this fantasy world. Ten of the Skeksis are still alive; ten of the Mystics are alive. Jen, a young Gelfling, had his family and most of his race killed by the Skeksis. The reason for this is a prophecy says that a Gelfling will force the Skeksis out of power. Jen has just learned that his destiny is to find the Crystal's missing shard and heal the Dark Crystal.

The movie follows Jen on his journey to find the shard and heal the Crystal. This is not a LOTR type journey though. This movie faces some major problems along the way. The actual movie just plays out very badly. There is one scene where the Skeksis are eating. They just seem to eat forever for no reason at all. This could have taken out, and maybe something interesting could have been added. There is also a repetitious route taken in this movie. Jen will arrive somewhere that seems safe, than he will be attacked by Garthim (the Skeksis's henchmen). Watching the movie feels like a chore at times due to these problems.

The soundtrack in this movie is fantastic. The music will always match the mood trying to be conveyed. However, it does not sound perfect on this DVD. Keep in mind that is movie was made in the 80s and the transfer cannot go through flawless. The voice acting in this movie is a serious problem. The narrator comes off completely monotone and boring. Jen sounds okay, but many others in this film come off emotionless. This is all largely due to the entire movie being made of puppets. Puppets simply cannot express emotion as humans can.

This version of the film came with no extras. I think a commentary or making-of feature would be highly enjoyable. The only thing you get is previews. I am not sure, if that is because it is the digital copy, or if only the collector's edition has extras. If you have to buy one version, I suggest the Collector's Edition. The digital transfer is completely pointless unless you would like to waste your computer's space. You can put this on a video-capable I-Pod, PSP, or PS3 if that is your wish. The Digital portion of this film expires though. If you are expecting to buy this used, be warned that the Digital copy may have expired.

There are parts of Dark Crystal that I enjoyed. Despite their lack of sentiment, I loved the design of the puppets. Considering all the characters in the movie are Jim Henson designed puppets, I am glad that they are well done. The story is also interesting. It may come off as typical fantasy, but the story has a certain appeal to it. The world is designed great. It all comes off as fake, but again has a certain appeal to it.

One thing you need to avoid doing is renting this movie in any format and expecting to like this movie. If you are going to enjoy this movie, you are going to need to learn to love it. Watching it a couple times over a long period of time will allow Dark Crystal to grow on you. The problems in this will prevent this from being great though. If you are into fantasy, try this one.",1223078400,2,3675,4.405007363770251

This film, ""The Dark Crystal"", is also brilliant in its own right. There are no human characters, the setting are definitely otherworldly, and the villains are definitely not kid-friendly. What I like most about this film is the way the characters are created (Jim Henson did a find job with the Tolkienesque muppets). What I like least about this film is that, like other reviewers have mentioned, the film tends to drag in some parts (most notably the first twenty minutes). But that flaw aside, this film along with many other dark family films ranks somewhere near the top of my list.

But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in ""The Dark Crystal,"" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.

On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.

The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?

Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in ""The Dark Crystal"" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.

Instead of some pan-medieval land, ""The Dark Crystal"" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. ""The Dark Crystal"" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.

Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.

At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (""Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!"") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.

""The Dark Crystal"" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.",1218240000,,3742,5.163366336633663

576119,2,6303122876,"The Dark Crystal opens up with a fairly good start. By the serious and profound voice of the narrator, you'll be thinking that this is going to be good. But as the film rolls on, its many flaws and weaknesses begin to show through.
 Jim Henson is talented and it's amazing the different kinds of puppetry and animatronics he blends together to create this other world, but I'm sorry to say it just isn't good enough. The Mystics' movements are so slow that it's a wonder they make it to the Skeksis castle even by the end of the film! I know they're old but come on! Then there's our hero the Gelfling. It's impossible for him to evoke any sympathy or emotion from the viewer because since he's a puppet he's not capable of facial expressions! The only way we know that he is sad or happy is by his voice. The puppet even with that still seems lifeless.
  Another problem is the story. Though we are told that the Skeksis are corrupt wizards and the Mystics good wizards, we NEVER see ANY wizardry from either of them whatsoever. If you are hoping for a great wizard finale, look elsewhere. They don't ever cast any spells; they don't ever have magic objects with them or concoct amazing potions; they're just there really.
  Again with the puppetry. There is a scene where the Skeksis' Garthim come barging into the ugly, wise, old woman's laboratory to get the Gelfling. This was intended to be an exciting sequence. The Gelfling just misses a Garthim's clutches before he gets on the old hag's rotating planet thingy, but because of the cheap, crude, silly movements of the character it looks too fake and lackluster.
  This film would have worked so much better if it was animated by some talented artists. Having more believable and smoother movements from the characters, facial expressions, and beautiful artwork and scenery would have turned this sad yarn into what it was intended to be: an enjoyable fantasy epic.
  Also a pet peeve of mines is the chamberlain Skeksis. Oh my Lord!  Give me an ax to hack that thing with! I know Jim Henson is trying to give individuality to his characters; give them certain traits to make them memorable and distinct from the others, but come on!  All his stupid whining and 'Hmmmmmm..."" sounds happened practically every time he comes in the scene.
 You can't say that I'm judging this film unjustly because I am an adult. You can't say that if I was a child then I wouldn't have noticed these things and would have enjoyed it. Sorry wrong. I hated this film as a child and still do. I thought that now that I am older and more open minded about things I used to dislike that I might care for this. Nope. Still stupid. Still sucks.
  You want a good fantasy? See the Neverending story, Willow, Castle in the Sky, The Secret of Nimh, or even Henson's Labyrinth. They all work much better and are better films.",1215907200,3,2854,4.548828125

""The Dark Crystal"" may have been big news back when it came out (in 1982), but it's hard to see what it has to offer anybody in the age of CGI and complete digitization.  It hasn't held up well.

Set in another world, the story concerns the quest of an innocent elf-like creature who must return a crystal shard to its proper resting place in order to save the land.  There are no humans in this movie, only Muppet-like creatures.  (In case you don't know, this film is considered the masterwork of the two masterminds behind the Muppets, Jim Henson and Frank Oz.)

Unfortunately for today's viewers, the technology available for breathing life into movie creatures has so comprehensively improved since this film was shot that the ""Dark Crystal"" cannot avoid showing its age at every turn.  Fatally, for a fantasy, it's simply impossible to lose yourself in the world the film attempts to create, since in nearly every shot you cannot get it out of your head that you are essentially looking at a bunch of puppets, or, occasionally, some guy in a mechanized costume.

As for the story, I found it predictable and marvel at those who claim it is ""imaginative.""  I award very low marks on originality:  nearly every story element had been done to death long before this movie saw the light of day.

So who would like this movie?  Children, I guess, -- or perhaps somebody who seems to have an unnatural admiration for all things Muppet.

But even then I have reservations.  The film is so dark, photographically as well as thematically, that it will probably bum you out for the day.  Even during those few moments when the sun in shining, the film still comes across as oppressively dark.  True, the directors attempt to relieve the gloom in the final ten seconds or so, but by then it's too little, too late.  So basically it's like muppets but without the fun.

Heck, this movie might be unsuitable even for kids.  So unrelievedly grim and violent is it (stabbings, burnings, fallings to one's death) that it will probably give any kid under nine at least a couple of nightmares.

There are plenty of kids' movies out there these days that also have something to say to adults, but not this one.  I cannot imagine anything appealing to adults in this movie, especially if you make the mistake of viewing the ""making of"" documentary, also on this DVD, which will completely breaks any spell the film had a chance at.

As for the story, I paid strict attention but was needled by crippling questions.  The filmmakers seemed to do a terrible job explaining what's going on, where the crystal came from, how it works, how it got broken, or why anybody even needed it to begin with.",1212796800,8,2755,4.611909650924025
576171,5,6303122876,"So begins Jim Henson's 1982 masterpiece The Dark Crystal, an amazing fantasy film that primarily uses puppets as its main characters.

The level of detail and the precision of the artistry that went into this film is a testament to what a great filmmaker can do, and Jim Henson was (and still is) a great filmmaker.

The story concerns Jen, a Gelfling, who must save his planet by restoring the legendary Dark Crystal, which must be done before the three suns of his planet meet in the Great Conjunction. If he fails chaos and destruction shall reign eternal. He begins his mission after his mentor, the wisest of the Mystics, dies. To a young Gelfling like Jen, the world seems an enormous and strange place. He encounters numerous dangers but finally reaches the home of the ancient being known as Aughra. Aughra gives Jen the crystal shard that he seeks, but the forces of evil invade her home and Jen has to flee before she can tell him anymore about his task. Meanwhile the cruel Skeksis are hunting Jen, for it is prophesized that a Gelfling will bring about their doom. But Jen finds an ally in Kira, the only other living Gelfling to survive the Skeksis' slaughter of their race years before. Jen and Kira, along with her furry and ferocious pet Fizzgig, set out for the castle of the Skeksis. But can they survive the dangers of the journey and restore balance to their world?

Henson's film (I should also mention that it was co-directed by puppeteer Frank Oz) is a stunning achievement in pre-digital special effects and features a profound philosophical/spiritual undercurrent that has fascinated viewers for over 25 years. The film is exciting, stimulating and perhaps at times too intense for younger children. But overall it's one of the greatest fantasy films ever made!

The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD includes the following special features: a beautiful new high definition film transfer, a new commentary track with conceptual designer Brian Froud, The World of the Dark Crystal vintage documentary, deleted scenes, original work print scenes, character illustrations, the new Light on the Path of Creation & Shard of Illusion documentaries, and previews.

576259,5,6303122876,"This have to be Jim Henson's best movie - too bad it is hard to find or unknown by a large number of people - I was shocked to find this movie in a walmart - I thought the muppets, big seasame street and the other characters from the late 80s onwards were Jim Henson's only work (Labyrinth was a except - I saw it in high school class) - I only caught fleeting images of his other works from old Sci Fiction vhs ads which I either rented or watched at other people's home. This movie is amazing - I meant amazing into that it show even ecosystems - not digitalized or anything that are made of puppets or props (no real plants were used or large amount of fake plants) - I can't just stop thinking of that scene which show a fast turtle - like creature chasing fireflies - like creatures into the mouth of a creature which have the vague resemble to Jabba the Hutt that live in the ground which showed its sastify of the meal by blowing and moving the coral/sponge thing on its back in an alien forest ecosystem that is like a hybrid of a coral reef and a tropical rainforest. And that's just the short sideshow - the other characters, while rather clique like other sci fi movies moves and behave like any other modern movies. And that is not to even say of the crab - like golem? guards which are just a secondary character which are able to move its multi legs using just strings and other stage props - no digital erasing - the stage props are invisible to us - the viewer and behave like a creature/machine hybrid with jerking motions and then when it moves away it moves like a living creature. And then there's the ending to this movie - amazing.
I would like to recommend this movie to those who like special effects and the work the crew of Jim Henson put in this movie - the story is stale but the special effects and puppets are worth watching",1202256000,,1854,4.225352112676056

576266,5,6303122876,"Truly a classic among fantasy films.  I used to watch this movie all the time a child.  10 years later, it's still as good as ever.  Very good storyline, decent puppets (good for it's time, and definitely still watchable today), and cinematography to blow your mind.

Like I mentioned, a great story.  There are 3 main species in this film, even though a few others are shown.  The Gelflings (we only see 2, the main characters), the Skekcies (not sure how to spell that), and the Mystics.  The Mystics and the Skekcies used to be one, but then the Crystal gets cracked, a shard goes missing, and it becomes the dark crystal.  The species that once was becomes seperated into skekcies and mysics, and the skekcies are in charge of the castle the crystal is kept in.  Mystics get kicked out, and travel long and far to find a place of peace.  From there, the world starts to get a little messed up in various places, partly because creatures the skekcies send out wreck havoc, and practically the whole Gelfling species gets killed off.  One Gelfling gets adopted by the mystics, the other by these other small creatures.  One day, when the Gelfling grows up, the mystics sense that it's time to search for the crystal shard and restore the dark crystal to what it once was.  As the Gelfling searches for the shard, meets up with the other Gelfling, and searches some more, the mystics journey back to the castle.  If you want to know more about the rest of the story, you'll have to see the movie yourself.  It can't be missed.

Since it's very difficult to find such a great fantasy film, 5 stars all the way!",1192320000,,1610,4.5
576267,5,6303122876,The Dark Crystal is a fantastic puppetmation movie.  You are taken to a whole new world with new creatures.  There truly alien life forms everywhere and that's what makes the movie so special.  It's not just another alien movie because it happens somewhere else.  You actually feel like you're on an alien world.  It's just as powerful now as it was when I first saw it as a kid.,1191196800,,379,4.434782608695652
576268,2,6303122876,"The Dark Crystal is one of the movies I first saw when I was a kid. The movie has lost little of its charm over the years. I bought this version because I couldn't find the 25th anniversary version locally and didn't want to wait on shipping. The box said it had been 'mastered in HD' so I figured that meant it would look good on my 1080p HDTV. Well, I was wrong.

The quality of the picture in this version is terrible. It looks like they used a beat up rental VHS tape to make this DVD. Random pinpoint flashes of white marr just about every scene. There are also blemishes in the form of dirt specks and floating black hairs. For a short time near the end there are even faded thin bars that slide across the screen. The credits are even slightly blurry. I had to keep reminding myself that at least this was the first time I've seen the movie in widescreen format.

I had previously bought season 1 of the Muppet Show and it looks WONDERFUL on the same TV. So bright and vibrant, with a clear picture. Never in my wildest dreams would I have figured that a TV show from the 70s would look better on an HDTV than a movie that was 'mastered in HD'.

Don't waste your $10 like I did... Get the 25th anniversary verison instead. I'm not sure if the picture looks any better, but it sure can't look much worse.",1189123200,2,1310,4.190476190476191

576338,5,6303122876,"Organic over CGI any day! There is an intimate feeling in this fantasy film that is all too often lost in the sterility of computer animation these days. Even with texture rendering abilities breaking new ground everyday, in my opinion there's still nothing comparable to the soft magic which Jim Henson has created here. A team of creative wizards, free from the bonds of a cubicle, are literally submerged into the world of their creation. The Dark Crystal changed my understanding of puppetry forever....previously associated with the more simplistic creations viewed on television shows like Sesame Street & The Muppets, their full potential is revealed here! Some how, the more bazaar and unusual the characters become, the more real they seem to be.
Enjoy this film; it may be one of a kind!
This 25 year Anniversary Edition should be something Special! Damn...was it really that long ago?",1185667200,5,895,5.054054054054054
576339,2,6303122876,"This movie certainly stands as a singular achievement of its time, and also as a milestone in the development of film puppetry in general.
The unusual sense of reality that comes with the intricate puppet technology and the strong integration of the soundtrack provide a unique experience on more than one level.

The crippling caveat of this film for me is that a lot of creativity has been invested into making things look ugly to a degree that can in fact be difficult to watch. Not only are the Skeksis a bunch so awful that they could give normally sensitive viewers gastrospasms, it is also the action itself (extended scenes show them crumble to dust, drain sweet innocent beings from their soul to drink it as juice, or feast in the most nausea-inducing manner) that are hard to bear, will give children nightmares and leave you with a definite lack of appetite.

As much as I love specialty movies from the early 80ies (another gem from this period is the original TRON, for example) I would not want to watch ""The Dark Chrystal"" again any time soon - having all this pain in my brain once was more than enough.",1183766400,,1120,4.595
576340,5,6303122876,"This movie is Jim Henson's magnum opus. There isn't a fantasy movie out there that brings you to a whole different reality like The Dark Crystal does. The only movie that comes close is James Cameron's Avatar. Yes the movie is all performed entirely by puppets and yes there isn't a human being in site. That's the beauty of it. With a combination of an excellent story, innovative (for its time) animatronics, beautiful sets and cinematography you get a truly dazzling experience that any fantasy fan would be a fool not to miss.

The biggest aspect of Dark Crystal is the setting. They created a whole different world with its own animals, plants and terrain. The level of detail put into creating this new world is staggering and you get some good scenes to soak yourself up in it. From the rock caves of the Mystics to the jagged spires of the Skesis castle to Aughra's planetarium to every landscape in between. You will get drawn into this alien world. The beauty of the sets and location shots is only enhanced with some fantastic cinematography and conventional effects.

Since we are essentially talking about a puppet show brought to you as a feature film let's talk about the puppets. Granted they might seem a bit archaic by today's standards, they were nothing short of incredible back in 1982. To have puppets act and react in such an organic and lifelike fashion was never done on film before. This is the first movie where you get that sort of eye and mouth movements we have come so used to with current animatronics. Famed artist Brian Froud created all of the creatures and characters for Dark Crystal and if you're a fan of his work you will definitely see it. When you look at the majesty of the Mystics you forget they are just people covered in foam latex.

Of course having a truly creative setting and truly creative characters would not be enough to make a great movie. Lord knows fantasy fans have seen plenty of examples that prove that point. However this movie has a story that is as classic as any fable you have read before. By the time you finish this movie if will feel like you just read a grand fairy tale... only about wondrous and fantastic creatures never seen before. It's not deep storytelling. Then again it shouldn't be considering the mythical theme.

The soundtrack for this film is a perfect fit for the movie. The main themes are grand, dynamic and best of all memorable with a full orchestra giving the music vibrant life. Other pieces of the film work with what I can best describe as old western European instrumentation and themes, and again they work wonderfully. I can think of about a half dozen songs from the movie right now that would stick in my head in a good way if I let it. The music is that memorable. Okay... I do remember one song in the least useful scene (Skeksis banquet) in the movie that didn't impress me. But to be honest the music was fitting the scene, and the scene didn't impress me either.

The original release of this DVD had a host of wonderful extras that made it feel like the only DVD you would ever need. Then came the 25th Anniversary Edition, which gave an impressive upgrade to the visuals (I mean night and day difference) via a digital remaster, Dolby Digital Surround sound, a new commentary and some additional features. On a small note they took out the Spanish stereo track the original DVD had and included a surround track in Japanese.

Now we have the Blu-Ray. Even if you bought any of the previous releases (and all of them were worthy purchases at the time) you definitely want to make that double/triple dip. And I thought the Anniversary Edition was an amazing improvement. The details really, really stand out on the Blu-Ray. I see little details as plain as day that I never noticed before. It even gives new life to the aging puppets by bringing out even the subtlest of details. The sound is very much improved with Dolby TruHD in English, French and Portugese. A Dolby Digital surround Spanish track is finally included. Looks like they corrected the absence of the Spanish track on the Anniversary Edition, and then some. But then they take out the Japanese audio track. What's going on here? There are a few new extras on the Blu-Ray, but nothing that compares to the previous features. Here is a run down:

COMMENTARY BY BRIAN FROUD - Brian is the conceptual designer for the movie and essentially created the world for Jim Henson. He goes on about design techniques and how he came about the characters and inspirations for his work in The Dark Crystal.

WORLD OF THE DARK CRYSTAL - The most amazing ""making of"" documentary one can ever ask for. It details over an hour of footage regarding conceptual design, character creation, production, cinematography, the philosophy behind the creation of this movie and the world it is based on, and more. This documentary was made while the Dark Crystal was released so you get interviews with the man himself, Jim Henson, at the time of the movie along with scores of others involved in the movie. Most ""making of"" documentaries that come out with movies these days are little more than lip service to help promote the movie. I wish they would follow the model done on THIS documentary.

REFLECTIONS OF THE DARK CRYSTAL - Two-part featurette (Shard of Illusion [16 minutes] and Light on the Path of Creation [20 minutes]) with more recent interviews from writers, directors, and performers including co-writer David O'Dell, conceptual designer Brian Froud, and Jim Henson's son Brian. These featurettes also include newly discovered test footage from Jim Henson's home in England.

PICTURE-IN-PICTURE STORYBOARD TRACK - This is probably the best Blu-Ray exclusive feature in the set. As the titles describes you get a sizable window showing pre-production storyboards and conceptual drawings, each with descriptions of what you are seeing.

THE BOOK OF THRA: THE DARK CRYSTAL COLLECTOR - Hmm... is it a game? You click a button on the remote every time you see an icon appear. Not much of a game. Is it an in-movie encyclopedia? When you collect the entries in this Blu-Ray exclusive you get notes on various characters, places, and creatures in the film. Mostly the names and duties of the Skeksis and Urru (mystics). It's neat, but it would have been less cumbersome if they just made a data file type page instead of something you have to watch the movie to see. The details are sparse, and if you want to really get into this universe you're better off getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-of-the-Dark-Crystal/dp/B001H55MBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World of the Dark Crystal</a>. Or better yet Wikipedia.

ORIGINAL SKEKSIS LANGUAGE: Test Scenes - The original concept of The Dark Crystal was to have many of the creatures speak their own language, which we would get subtitles for, in order to further put in that different world. I think that would have been a cool way to see the movie and with this footage you get an idea of Jim Henson's original concept. Keep in mind this is not fully produced footage  and it's not the same as seeing the end product. Namely the character Augra is being dubbed with Frank Oz's Miss Piggy-esque voice over and of course there is no music or post-production. Still it's interesting to get a taste of what the movie could have been like.

DELETED FUNERAL SCENES - Just a deleted scene of the Skeksis funeral. You're really not missing much taking it out if you ask me. The funeral itself is boring. The scene has some footwate with Jen talking to one of the Mystics about his quest, which was nice. No remastering on the scene of course. It's pretty grainy.

SKEKTEK'S CRYSTAL CHALLENGE - Also a Blu-Ray Exclusive. It's a trivia game played throughout the movie. A question pops up and you have to answer or get some of your essence drained. Not as annoying as the Book of Thra feature, but I still don't see why they don't just put this separate from the film.

Every time I have reviewed a Dark Crystal disk I have been impressed. It seems they just keep getting better and better. The first one had the movie with a good array of language tracks and extra features that still top all that has been offered since. The second one ups the ante with an amazing digital remastering. Now the Blu-Ray gives and absolutely jaw dropping visual and audio presentation that even dwarfs the visual clarity of the second release; especially for a movie that was made back in 1982. If you have a Blu-Ray player and like The Dark Crystal you owe it to yourself to get this.

I will admit that some people might be put off of this movie due to the lack of human actors in front of you and the fact the puppet animatronics might feel dated (although I feel less so with the Blu-Ray presentation). It's a shame people would feel that way because The Dark Crystal is fantasy storytelling at its finest. If you are a fan of the genre this movie is an absolute must. If you're a Muppet fan... well these aren't Muppets so don't expect Fraggle Rock when you see it. Any fan of grand storytelling who wants to be whisked away to a strange faraway land will find what they are looking for in The Dark Crystal.

576416,3,6303122876,"I have always wanted to purchased this DVD but I was disappointed with the Collector's Edition Boxed Set. The film was digitally remastered both audio and Anamorphic video but picture quality was not restored. What a pity!

I guess there will be an Ultimate Edition coming, some time in the future.

The reason for saying this is, Orphanage Animation Studios is producing the sequel and the title is Power of the Dark Crystal which is scheduled to release in spring 2008. I am sure they will do something with picture quality of the current release of Dark Crystal DVD Editions as well as enhancing the CGIs and other special effects in the movie.

So for those who want to buy or add this movie into his or her DVD library, I suggest that you wait till the sequel release next year. You might get better picture and technical quality, or perhaps other extra features, if/when they re-release the film in the DVD market.

The movie is basically a children's story, but like some of Tolkien's work, to which it could be compared, it has depths that make it enjoyable to adults as well.  A real gem for the whole family.

You also get interviews with key staff like conceptual designer Brian Froud as well as Jim Henson and Frank Oz. This feature is worth having. Trust me.

Deleted Scenes - Essentially scenes of the Skesis Emperor's funeral. Not as exciting as the documentary and I can see why it was taken out of the final cut of the movie.

Original language workprint - This is cool. The first idea for the movie was there would be a totally original language(s) that would be spoken and then subtitled for our benefit. I think it would have been awesome to see that, but in the end the studio chickened out. At least we get a taste of what it would have been like in these test prints. Keep in mind they aren't scenes in full production so they look grainy and there is some harsh dubbing with Frank Oz filling in some voices.

On top of that you get dolby surround and Spanish mono, character drawings and profiles, separate music score, talent files and trailers. Not bad if you ask me. Don't bother with the Collector's Edition. All you get is essentially the original script, some storyboards and additional illustrations. Not worth the extra price. The Jim Henson Family Film Collection is a good alternative too, with all the extras mentioned on the original edition as well as two other Jim Henson films.

I will admit that some people might be put off of this movie due to the lack of human actors in front of you and the fact the puppet animatronics might feel dated. It's a shame people would feel that way because The Dark Crystal is fantasy storytelling at its finest. If you are a fan of the genre this movie is an absolute must. If you're a Muppet fan... well these aren't Muppets so don't expect Fraggle Rock when you see it. Any fan of grand storytelling who wants to be whisked away to a strange faraway land will find what they are looking for in The Dark Crystal.

576524,4,6303122876,"It has been a thousand years since the Dark Crystal was broken.  The break caused the creation of the cruel Skeksis and the peaceful Mystics.  A young Gelfling whose family was killed by the Skeksis has been raised by the Mystics.  Now he learns that he has a destiny.  He is to retrieve the missing shard of the Crystal and heal it.  If he doesn't, then darkness will rule forever.  It is because of this prophesy that the Skeksis destroyed his people.  If there are no Gelflings then no Gelfling can end their power.

So begins a journey for the young Gelfling.  He must visit a seer, avoid capture, reach the citadel of the Crystal, and figure out how to heal it.  Along the way he discovers a female Gelfling and the two continue his journey togther.  As the time of the prophesy draws near the Mystics also journey to the Citadel.  For when the three suns come together the Crystal must be healed.  Strange creatures and fantastic vistas await.  Will the Gelfling succeed and bring peace to his world or will the cruel Skeksis rule forever?

Jim Henson teams up with the visual artistry of Brian Froud to create this fantasy epic.  These puppets go far beyond anything previously known as a Muppet but seem closer to those Henson created for Saturday Night Live.  The scope and vision of this film is one that you would not expect puppets (if they can be called that) to be able to pull off.  This is epic fantasy in the truest sense and joins the ranks of the few epic fantasies that have succeeded in film.  Check it out.",1162771200,7,1528,4.451263537906137

576528,5,6303122876,"Jim Henson is more genius than we know.  Beyond Labyrinth, Big Bird and Miss Piggy comes a story far different and far more fantastical than anything ever exhibited on screen to date.  It was a movie created many, many years before its time that explored aspects and concepts that exist in the philosophies of some of our oldest religions today...along with a great adventure story.

While exhibited in the guise of a children's fantasy film, if you dig deeper in the symbology and metaphors of the film there are great truths that exist.  The oneness of life, humanity and spirit.  The duality of good and evil.  Mortality and immortality.  Images of light and darkness.  What a genious manner in which it was filmed, scored and portrayed.  This is indeed Jim henson's finest cinematic work.

Some beliefs do acknowledge that in ancient of ancient times there was life in all things:  rocks, plants, trees could talk and move, there existed a highly sophisticated and superior race of beings that suddenly vanished or became obliterated.

It is understandable that ""The Dark Crystal"" had failed at the box office when it first came out.  Such a small scale epic could not compete in the shadow of the success of the original Star Wars.  But this quieter film is still a spectacle of its own and, much like its Star Wars counterpart, has become a unique classic of richness and depth...one that can never be repeated again. I've enjoyed this movie since I was a kid, and it's never lost its appeal after 24 years. This is well worth the money spent to keep in your DVD library",1160697600,,1576,4.704379562043796
576529,5,6303122876,"It took an infinity of imagination to make The Dark Crystal, a film so overflowing with invention that you literally have to watch it about 100 times just to take it all in. Everyone involved, from the director to the best boy gave the film such loving affection and made it the best it could possibly be. Kid's movies (if you want to call it that) these days simply are not what they used to be and probably never will be again. This is yet another thing that makes The Dark Crystal so damn precious.

The film is set in another world, in another time in an age of wonder. It has been 999 years and 1 year since the powerful, life-giving crystal cracked and stopping shining. Since then the land has become barren and the Urskeks (a race of God-like beings) have split into two separate races, the peaceful Uru 'Mystics' and the evil Skeksis-a horrific cross between bird and reptile. The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years. If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever.

Jen is a Gelfling (a sort of fairy creature), believed to be the last of his race. A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land. Raised by the Uru, Jen begins a journey to repair the crystal when the Skeksis Emperor dies (in a truly disturbing scene). On his way he meets Aughra, a sort of witch creature and Kira, another Gelfling and her race of Podling people (sort of like Fraggles). Though there is no specific love scene between them, there is a very nice romance developing through-out the story.

Filmed in gorgeous locations across England and Scotland (with the use of a lot of matte paintings of course) the film really, really does take you to another world. There's not a single human in sight (a perfect world or what) and, with exception to the awful Skeksis, almost every creature is cute and fluffy (such as Kira's Fizzgig). The production design, in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud, is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more.

Trevor Jones' breathtaking, beautiful score is among his best work (tying with Merlin in 1998) and is surely some of the best film music you are ever likely to hear. Ever! There was a limited edition of the score put on CD a few years ago but only 5000 were ever printed. It's sure to be quite expensive now but it's so goddamn worth it! Henson, Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds. I prefer this one though (no fruity songs, no David Bowie!) as it has a certain edge to it that Labyrinth lacks.

An epic. A masterpiece. An unforgettable classic. The Dark Crystal is magical, mystical timeless classic. I can't recommend it enough. If only we still had movies like this. I'll take risk-taking The Dark Crystal over PC Disney drek any day.

The Blu Ray looks and sounds great with a 2.40:1 1080p picture and DTS HD-MA sound.",1159747200,5,3220,4.50513698630137

576531,3,6303122876,"Wow.  I love fantasy and I love Jim Henson, but I was really disappointed by this movie.

It's an architypical Joseph Campbell myth of the fight between Good and Evil involving two of the last of the race of Gelflings as they try to return a broken shard to the Dark Crystal to repair it before darkness takes over the world.  The movie has a lot of heart, but at times it comes too close to Star Wars for comfort.  Of course both of them are built upon the same rubric, but this film even has images, sounds, and characters almost exactly like Star Wars.  It doesn't really make it feel special.

Also, the voice acting in the puppets didn't really come out as roundly as I feel other Jim Henson movies have been.  This movie, if done with real actors with the same style of acting in motion as in voice, would probably be major camp.

However, despite my qualms, I just can't help enjoying it.  Henson and Oz's visualness is at full form here, especially in the forest, full of thousands of different and colorful set pieces, creatures, and things breathing, moving, and living.  Many things in this movie are creepy, majestic, magical, weird, gross, and funny all where they're supposed to be.  The world itself seems to follow its own natural laws, which is always appreciated in a work of fantasy.

It gets points for heart and imagination, but otherwise Henson has done a lot better.

While I appreciate the puppet-work and the eerie atmosphere, this move REALLY could have used more dynamic dialogue to pull the viewer into the story.

I was able to sit through the entire 12hr extended dvd version of Lord of the Rings without getting bored, but this movie just seemed to drag and drag to me...I couldn't get into it!",1149465600,5,592,4.462962962962963
576594,5,6303122876,"I felt I had to write a review for one reason.  I'm tired of reading some of the stupid BS coming out of people's mouths.

First and foremost, it is made from the Jim Hansen's Studios, so that means it is more than likely a muppet type movie.  So do not be tricked that it might not be.  But it is an amazing example of what a full length muppet movie should be.  It has an mix of mythology, love, danger, friendship, adventure, etc.  It has a story line that means you do have to pay some kind of attention, but can still watch while doing other things.  Something new is seen every time you watch it.  The scenery or background at times that you do not catch paying so much attention to the central characters.  The dialogue is not the best, but still better than many movies put out even today.

Second, stop trying to compare the movie to Lord of the Rings.  You are talking bout two different decades.  That is like trying to compare apples and oranges.  They both may be part of the fantasy genre, but no where near each other.  I do ask when writing a review, review the movie NOT what the movie is in relation to another.  I read a review to to get a review of this movie, not of how good another one was.  You could compare it in a sense to Labrynith or Legend, or even the muppet show to give an idea.  It is a movie on itself, and this one is a great movie.  I think it would be fine for a child, considering their are many children's movies out their far scarier.  And to say a classroom would not watch it, you are lucky if you could get one in a classroom to sit and watch any movie.

Have no fear when thinking of watching this movie.  It is a very well put together movie in most senses.  And a classic, and cult classic, in it's own right.

Enjoy...and as a reminder to everyone else.  PLEASE think things through when writing a review.  Act intellegent and really leave feelings out of it, or personal preferences, as most people do not share your preferences.",1144800000,6,1978,4.196808510638298

576597,1,6303122876,"Believe it or not, I never actually saw this movie until I bought it on Monday, despite my love of Labyrinth, all things dark and/or unconventional, and an extreme fascination with Brian Froud.

That said, even I found this movie creepy in parts.  I think if I had seen it as a kid, it would have scared the bejesus out of me, so I DO NOT recommend this for young kids, even though the little beasts are awfully jaded these days.

I actually still fell in love with the rather, shall we say, nonhuman characters.  My best friend was a rat, may she rest in peace, so I was delighted with all the little bug-eyed, fuzzy critters, like Fizzgig.

The story is typical for most eighties fantasy genre movies, in that a great quest is undertaken to save the (Other)world, by a naive and unsure hero, in this case a Gelfling named Jen, who meets his female counterpart in Kira.  I won't say any more about the storyline, because if you have not seen this and I talk about Skekses, Mystics, and Podlings, you'll only be like WTF is she talking about, which is what I thought before buying this DVD.

576598,5,6303122876,"Few people are aware of the ""story behind the story"" of The Dark Crystal! It was written by a (former?) Catholic priest to represent his belief about the true story of God's Creation from the very beginning to the end of time -BUT from the approach that our God is ""unconditionally"" loving rather than One with brutally vengeful hell-fire and brimstone. (I know...this not the way I learned the story in my Christian upbringing either, but this author's story of ""what life is all about"" rings so much more true to me now).

This priest/author went to the Muppets genius, Jim Henson, to produce the characters because he felt that human actors would not be able to portray all of beings that are storied in religions. Perhaps too, this inspired priest/author wanted a humble, low budget, but effective way of telling the world's most important story.

In case you're wondering, I read about this film's background stuff in an interview that was done with the author a couple years after this film came out. He said that both he and Henson had expected the film to be a blockbuster. However, the film's message went right over the heads of most viewers...perhaps the message was presented too abstractly. Subsequently -and unfortunately- The Dark Crystal has been relegated to ""The Creepy Children's Stories"" bin. Sad, because I think it is a work of genius. I'm not alone in this belief because I've met three very intellectual deep-thinkers who say they have watched it 7, 13, and 23 times repectively -each time learning something new!

The film is packed with many SEEMINGLY casual images (mountains in the background, etc.) -which actually represent important places and events in Christianity, Buddhism, Islam -even Buddhism. The more of a religious scholar one is, the more symbols he/she is likely to recognize. The Dark Crystal has very memorable and powerfully interesting characters who represent many of Christianity's/Islam's/Judism's important figures. It's fun to try to figure out the meanings of the various events in the film and WHO it is that each of the Dark Crystal's characters represent.

Everything means something in this film! And the ending! To me, the ending in The Dark Crystal rings totally true of what an UNCONDITIONALLY loving God would have in store for all of His created children -us humans and the Angels that came before us.

Okay, now you have the author's perspective. Kids can still enjoy The Dark Crystal as simply ""some fun characters' exciting adventure."" However, I invite you to watch this film with God's Creation in mind...and see if you still think it's nothing more than a kiddie flick! The Dark Crystal not only worthy of being the blockbuster that the author thought it would be, but I think it's a profound and inspired film. It's great for interesting discussion after watching.

There was something that never really seemed to appeal to me. I honestly don't know what it was, but it just seemed like one of those totally weird movies. (Maybe I would say that NOW about Labyrinth if I hadn't seen it from a very young age?)

One of the reasons I felt about the film, was there was absolutely no human interest in it. There was no Jennifer Connolly or David Bowie, it was just really strange looking characters, and some really scary characters. Would it have been better if there was more human interest? Well, my boyfriend loves this movie, so there must be something good about it I'm not getting.

I switched it off after nearly 20 minutes, simply because something just wasn't right. It took quite a bit to actually press the off button, I felt so bad about it, because it had taken me a couple of years to actually get round to watching it. And then I was disappointed. But as soon as it started, I had this feeling I wasn't going to like it? Why? Because the narrator had the most irritating voice ever!!! He was so monotone, and literally gave me the chills. And then the crystal wasn't actually dark, it was more purply in colour. But the characters were hideous. They weren't that bad in Labyrinth, but there was something about them that gave me a serious case of the heebie jeebies. I have to say, what little I saw of the skeksis, I found them very scary, and the lead guy dying ... Brrrrrrrr! Something I won't forget in a hurry.

I'm still holding onto the fact I might have enjoyed it more if I'd seen it when I was younger. And of course, it looks like I'm gonna be the only person to say this film wasn't that great.

Throughtout the entire film you never once find an actor or actress, everything is performed either by puppets or amazing costumes. Jim Henson and Frank Oz have only done 2 films in this genre including the (not nearly as good) Labyrinth. It to is rich with amazing sets and creature desighn but it constantly thows sappy dialogue at you and poor written songs. Dark Crystal still has some bad dialogue but originally had it's own language. Dubbing always makes things sound worse. The Jim Henson company is currently releasing Mirrormask whitch looks great and is along the same lines as Dark Crystal and Labyrinth with a higher budget.

But having said that, it is an interesting and very unique little movie. Worth checking out if you can handle the fear that the horrible Skeksis inspire.",1122508800,2,447,4.397590361445783

The mystics are beatifully designed and a delight to watch, the skeksis on the other hand are a mess and seem more like cluttered lumps of cloth and hair. It's to much!

Henson at the time was trying to brake out of the kiddie films he had done with the Muppets and I suppose when Yoda became a popular ""seriouse"" character in the Star Wars films (which Yoda was voiced and operated by non other than Frank Oz-the very director for this film!) I suppose Henson saw this as his effort toward the adults.

But it didn't work, a majority of the reviews found here support this film as a kiddie film and it was never intended to be that. Even the fans of this film missed the point!

I realy wanted to like this film way back when I first saw it in theaters, and I wanted to like it after I purchased the collectors edition-but I can't say I enjoy watching this film. The story just isn't a good one. There is no pacing at all and It doesn't pull me in by having me believe what is happening on film, everything looks and feels fake.

Comparing this film to The Lord of The Rings films is also grossly unfair so I will not even go there as other reviewers have.

I respect Hensons effort, I like what he was TRYING to do, but in the end this film is just OK.It's not good, It's not bad, It's OK.

*The so called ""rape"" scene BTW is not a rape scene at all as one reviewer commented but a Skesis being stripped of his robes, It was meant to be a punishment for losing a challenge and this scene WAS in the Theatrical release of the film. If you don't understand whats happening don't make unfair comments.

I have two daughters who both also love this movie.  I do not see anything wrong with letting children watch this.  Yes, it is darker than Sesame Street but it is a great adventure story.

I would like to add my commment about the supossed ""rape scene"" comment that was left.  This person obviously doesn't know the meaning of the word rape or they did not pay attention to the movie.  The ""rape"" the person is talking about is the banishment of one of the skesis.  The skesis has lost a battle and is stripped of his clothes and banished by the other skesis.  Calling this ""rape"" is a gross misrepresentation of the word and I feel makes one think the movie would be unsuitable for children.

Overall this is a great adventure movie with an exciting plot that is great for the whole family.",1121040000,4,1040,4.392670157068062
576750,3,6303122876,"The story is like Lord of the Rings in the sense that we have all good vs all evil, and an object is carried by a halfling to straighten out the whole mess.

In this case, the halfling is called a gelfling and it is the most human of the creatures in the story.  There are a pair of them, a boy and a girl, and they're cute.  Their faces are elongated to make them look just a bit like non-humans.

The object is not a ring.  It is a small shard off of a huge magic crystal.  The gelfling must stick it back into the crystal to make the crystal whole, so that good will prevail in his world.

The bad guys have control of the dark crystal and use it for evil purposes, to steal the life substance from helpless creatures in order to drink it themselves and become youthful.

The race of good guys reminds me of a later movie, The Fifth Element.  The good guys are slow moving creatures, a bit brontosaurus like.  The bad guys are vulture-like, and a bit dinosaur-like as well.

The strength of this film isn't in the plot.  It is in the physical characters and the world that is created.  Jim Henson's specialty is the creation of characters and a world to put them in.

The plot itself is a simple save the world scenario, and you really wouldn't want to bet your mortgage on the bad guys winning, would you.

So a review of the movie would be a review of the characters that have been created, and they are as good as you would expect from Henson.

There isn't a lot of violence on screen.  This film is scarier than Sesame Street, but not overly so.  I don't think it would give most children nightmares.  It might give some sensitive children nightmares, because there is evil in it.

There is an ambivalence in some of the characters.  You don't quite know whether to put them in the category of good or bad.  And the good and bad races blend together in the end, which of course doesn't happen in Lord of the Rings, or World War Two, which LOTR was written during.

The story is very simple and involves the conflict between good and evil. A gelfling, Jen, must heal the crystal controled by the evil skeksis. The crystal was originally damamged long ago and a prophecy states that if a gelfling does not heal it before a certain astronomical phenomenon, the skeksis will rule forever. It is typical ""go on a heroic quest"" sort of stuff but it works.

The pseudo-muppet characters demonstrate a wonderful degree of creativity and the artwork is wonderful. The voices of the skeksis threatned to drive me nuts with their whinny quality but I guess that is what you would expect of a bunch of self centered bad guys.

A world that once thrived is now nearly a wasteland, ruled over by cruel, half bird/half lizard creatures called the Skeksis. The planet's more humble creatures flee from their presence. Their evil is countered only by a race of good and kind wizards called the Mystics, but it is the Skeksis who maintain power over the Dark Crystal. The only hope for returning balance to their world is in that of a small gelfling boy named Jen, who, with the help of his new friends, Kira and Fizzgig, and the guidance of a wise old woman named Aughra, must reunite the Dark Crystal with its missing shard and heal an ancient species.

An adventure that could only have come from the mind of Jim Henson, ""The Dark Crystal"" is a masterpiece in every sense. Bringing to vivid life the fantastical and grotesque illustrations of Brian Froud, and clearly influenced by ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Lord of the Rings,"" Jim Henson and Co-Director Frank Oz  have invented a world all their own. Every creature and character that appears onscreen is a figment of the imagination, and each one is as real as you or I. The visual effects and scenery are a feast for the eyes, but the simple and engaging story is equally captivating. In the Gelflings, the filmmakers manage to capture the very embodiment of pure innocence and goodness, and in the Skeksis, the very essence of evil. The Special Edition DVD release has more than enough extras to satisfy, the most overwhelming of which is the hour long making-of documentary, ""The World of the Dark Crystal.""  Other features include deleted and work-print scenes, trailers, character art profiles, talent files, and an isolated music score. Well worth the purchase for anyone looking to own the quintessential 80's fantasy film. And, while I don't think her much to look at, Kira's voice is heavenly.",1110412800,,1940,4.733727810650888

576757,5,6303122876,"I have associations with this film, dating back to when I was a small child.  I was always a great fan of the great genius, Jim Henson, his innovation, humor and intelligence as an artist, a puppeteer and a man.  Not only did Jim Henson's transition from Sesame Street to the big screen succeed marvelously in THE DARK CRYSTAL, but, for me, this is one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. I haven't had a chance to see THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but, for me, at the tender age of two, this was the RINGS of my generation (1980s).

It is the story of Jen, a young gelfling, raised by the Mystics, a race on the brink of extinction, living in a world on the verge of darkness, as the evil, lizard-like/monsterous skexies who wish to take over the essence from a precious crystal.  The skexies want to wipe out Jen's gelfling race, and he must run for his life, and also must make a great and courageous journey to save his planet from the plot of the evil creatures.  On the way, he encounters Keira, a girl gelfling, her pomeranian-esque pet, Fizgig (a creature with two sets of teeth and a raging temper), the musical potlins (little hippy creatures who have a lust for life and great music), and many other twists and turns.

Not only is this fantasy story engaging, but, it is worth noting that this film was made without the use of ANY computer special effects.  Some of the life-sized puppets, worn by puppeteers, weighed a couple hundred pounds each!! What's more, it is a cautionary tale about the state of the environment, and its pending demise.  How timely!  This film is truly timeless.  There will never be a puppet quite as masterful, creative and ingenius as the late, great Jim Henson.  I believe that anyone over the age of seven will enjoy it, and, maybe, even children younger than that.  A note:  There are some scary scenes that may frighten young children.

The powerfull Mystics and the Dark Skeksis, each a balance to one another, when one dies so does the other. This balance of light and dark is a perfect symbol for lifes journey. This work must have been inspiried by the divine. When you watch this film, this epic film, pay close attention to the rich symbols in both the Mystic's realm and that of the Skeksis.

By the end of the movie, only two had survived this insult to our intelligence as human beings (And the only reason those two stayed to watch nasty buzzards and annoying gophers for two hours was because one was stubborn and the other was drunk).

576844,5,6303122876,"This is my favorite among Henson's movies. The story is exciting and a little unusual. Gen, our hero is on a quest to save the world from eternal evil, mediated by the Dark Crystal itself. Raised by the gentle Mystics (in a village that looks like the world of Myst), he must do his part to defeat the power-mad Skexes. The Mystics too, have a role to play in that defeat, hinted at throughout the movie but revealed only at the end.

The wonder of this movie is in the visual richness of every scene. It's all live-action, but the fantasy action of Henson's imagination and artistry. The forests are alive with plant-like animals, animal-like plants, and other wonders. Along the way, he meets Ogra - a benign sorceress with speech habits like Yoda and a huge astronomical model later copied in the Tomb Raider movie. Every character is a unique creation, in personality and in appearance. Even the Skexes all differ in their unpleasantness. The Mystics, too, are each unique beings.

As an aside, I made a trip to a zoo many years after seeing this the first time. A zoo docent showed us how a porcupine could walk on its hind legs. The waddle of that thick-bodied little animal was incredibly like the way the Mystics walked. Maybe coincidence, but I would prefer to think that Henson's creative mind drew on such sources to help sustain credulity in this incredible world.

The Dark Crystal is a great kids' film, but may be a bit much for the very youngest. Don't wait for a kid though, adults can enjoy this on their own.

576847,3,6303122876,"Perhaps *beautiful* is the wrong word, for this movie is rarely aesthetically beautiful. Don't get me wrong on this point, beauty is not necessarily a good thing. What I mean to say is, atmospherically this is a triumph... but not beautiful. The 'characters' blend in perfectly(... beautifully?) to their world. The landscapes are... well... dark (which is fitting). It's aesthetically perfect, and in a movie like this, perfection demands there be little beauty.
The creatures are organic. 'Nuff said. They're wonderful. They're believable. They're just plain... wow.
So what's missing?
Terry Gilliam is quoted as saying a children's movie should be ""Exciting enough for adults, and intelligent enough for kids"" (Re: Time Bandits). The Dark Crystal is an imaginative masterpiece, but I couldn't help but feel the simplistic plot, 2-dimensional characters (I appreciate that making puppets' mental workings visible must be one of the hardest tasks in a movie with a fully puppet cast) patronizes the intelligence of all but the youngest children. They're a lot brighter than we treat them, and they're getting brighter by the day ;)
But, I suppose a great movie can do without great characters as long as the focus isn't on the characters, as long as it compensates atmospherically. And ""The Dark Crystal"" more than compensates.
So what's missing?
I'll relate this to another adventure movie: Dune. Dune was atmospherically beautiful, but it took itself too seriously. It was a massive undertaking, granted, but I can't remember laughing... or even smiling once. 137 minutes without smiling is a long time.
And it's the same with ""The Dark Crystal"". The only slightly comic break from the plot is the antics of a round-furry-dog-thing, but this isn't enough. ""The Dark Crystal"" Takes its battle-between-good-and-evil far too seriously, and unless one's awe at the world Jim Henson created can last one the full 90 minutes or so of the movie, one becomes impatient. Humour is an important tool with infinite potential - especially in a movie aimed at children, but it's a tool almost entirely overlooked in ""The Dark Crystal"". Even in a story as serious as Macbeth takes a moment to let its audience step back and chuckle towards the beginning. ""The Dark Crystal"" doesn't give us this opportunity.
In conclusion, ""The Dark Crystal"" is a... beautiful movie, but one that takes itself far too seriously. I became impatient with the simplistic plot, 2-dimensional characters (as 'beautiful' as they may be), and almost total lack of humour, but... clearly from the other reviews I've read, other's did not.
RE: the DVD
It's a lovely little package, but for the price you pay for it, it better be. I'm particularly fond of the little note-pad included. I would have liked to see more documentaries on the DVD, perhaps audio commentary, but alas - it shall not be.",1089936000,9,2858,5.082978723404255
576848,5,6303122876,"When you think of Jim Henson you would sooner think of brightly colored animals with funny voices like dogs, bears, frogs and gonzos or fraggles. The Dark Crystal is something completely different however. It is scary, scary as hell.
It is a story of two races, Scepsis and Mystics who became seperated when the crystal cracked. To regain the balance in the universe the crystal must be whole again. In a prophecy it is said that a Gelfling will do this, allmost all of them are killed, except for one Gelfling called Jen...
Even though this movie is made 1982 it does not look dated at all. The puppets and body suits are amazing and really form their own world, much like Lord of the Rings. I'm surprised not more movies or stories in this fantasy world have been made.
This movie should not be watched by children under at least 12. The Scepsis are scary, vulture like creatures aided by an army of big bugs. Even the Gelflings look a little scary.
It's a masterpiece of puppetry, so definitely watch it.",1086825600,,1007,4.538461538461538

I recently got the DVD after it had fallen into the dust bin of my mind, and I found that this movie is every bit as good as I remembered it. Kids will enjoy it, but there's much more depth to the film that adults will appreciate as well.
This movie isn't without it's faults. The script suffers at a few points and the voice acting isn't as good as it could be, but the great puppetry effects and the story more than make up for it. It's incredible just how much work Henson put into this film. Watch the documentary on the Special Edition. It took them 5 years (and nine tons of foam latex) to make it, from conception to final cut. There were often several people operating one puppet, watching what they were doing on a monitor from inside. Try to imagine getting one take just right with all of the Skeksis in one shot. Henson even put $2 million of his own money into it.
The look and feel of this film is incredibly unique, thanks mostly to artist/conceptual designer Brian Froud. Some call the plot cliched, but I don't think so. Sure, there's no such thing as a completely original story. What makes a movie good is that it brings enough new material to the old formula to make it interesting, and The Dark Crystal delivers with a passion. It's hard to find a film that is as original as this one, especially with the deluge of garbage that Hollywood has been churning out lately.
The soundtrack of the movie also delivers. Trevor Jones (shame this guy isn't better known, perhaps The Dark Crystal was the peak of his career) created a magnificent score that complements the movie perfectly and accentuates the mood at all the right points.
A casual viewer might dismiss this film as nonsensical kiddie fare, but it becomes much more complex when one actually sits down and watches. The characters have a depth to them that you may not see right off the bat. Even though there's never a human in the film, you get a definite feel for the characters of the film and share the triumph at the end. There are several surprises throughout that often catch the view off guard but don't detract from the movie at all.
I was brought up with this movie, and I'm going to make certain that my own kids are brought up on this movie. It's a wonderful film that adults and children alike will enjoy, one that has yet to be matched. Jim Henson later did Labrynth, which was fun, but lacked the depth of The Dark Crystal.

It's just magical, mythical and exciting all at the same time and while it would appeal mostly to the under 10's, I know for a fact it appeals to a much wider audience.
The puppets are simply fantastic, so real looking infact and so well played that from the outset you never look upon them as puppets. Instead you'll look upon them as you would any other human actors. A great theme tune and amazing scenery really make this a blockbuster of a puppet movie.
I think we all need a bit of the old imaginary, fictionary tales once in a while. In the 80's there was the Dark Crystal, and others of course, and in this decade it would have to be lord of the rings.

576893,3,6303122876,"I'm a great fan of this movie, it's probably in my personal top ten favorite films (or if not then definitely in the top twenty), but while it's a great film this is not a great DVD.
The transfer of the movie is acceptable but not great - it's in widescreen as it should be, but there is still dirt and noise in various parts. The color and sharpness are superior to the previous VHS versions of course but that's about it.
The main thing the DVD lacks is extras - this ""set"" is a single disc containing both the movie and supplements, and the only significant one is the ""World of the Dark Crystal"" making-of documentary. Everything else is lacking. There are storyboards, very well drawn storyboards in fact, but there is only a small sampling of a few of them (6 I think, maybe less) not storyboards for the whole movie. Then there are character illustrations and profiles - when I first saw these I though ""great, well worth having"" as they are beautiful pieces of artwork by Brain Froud - however I quickly realized that there are only a few of these too, not one for every character, or at least every major character, as I had hoped.
The biggest disappointment was the lack of running commentary. This is my favorite feature on any DVD, particularly when there are several commentary tracks. When they are well done it's a fantastic feature - see Fight Club, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Criterion edition), The Lord of the Rings series (extended editions), The Simpsons box sets and most of Kevin Smith's movies for examples of great commentaries. So how many commentary tracks do you get on this DVD? Zero. 0. Goose egg. Nada. Zip. Zilch. I know Jim Henson is dead, and it was tragic that he died so young, but Frank Oz, the co-director and a  major performer in the film is still with us as are many others who worked on it, as well as Jim Henson's kids, and so on. I'm not buying another edition of this DVD after feeling ripped off by this one however, so if they do crank out the ""ultra super mondo special really really final and this time we mean it"" edition with commentary I'm not buying it. Had this version been correctly priced for what it is, $20, maybe $25 max instead of $45, I might have shelled out again for another future edition but as it is, forget it.
The reproduction of Jim Henson's original notepad with his first ideas for The Dark Crystal is really rather dull and uninteresting. The frame of 35mm film from the movie that comes in the set is a novelty but not really a big deal - and that's about all you get. In this day and age where you can get some really great values on DVD (Lord of the Rings extended editions for example) this stands out as a bad deal. The Simpsons seasons 2 and 3 sets cost about $12 less than this for far more material, same for The Lord of the Rings films.
Go for the more basic, less expensive version of the DVD, the ""boxed set"" isn't worth it, though this great movie definitely is.
Overall 3 stars - would have been 4 stars if it was reasonably priced, 5 if they had the extras like commentary too. The movie by itself is 5 stars, the DVD by itself is 2 stars at best.",1078358400,12,3140,4.340136054421769
576894,3,6303122876,"I really think this film is one of those that you need to have grown up with to fully appreciate.  A few things have dated noticeably (oh boy, has technology come a LONG way) but in essence it's still a great movie to stick the kiddies in front of.  Although, those Skeksis are pretty nasty-looking.
One thing that is near impossible to avoid and has probably been mentioned before by many reviewers is the ABYSMAL voice acting.  I mean, it's really quite hideous.  Most video games have better voicing.  The dialogue is not that great to begin with, but you really notice it when those little puppets start whining away.
That said, the puppetry is awesome, an incredible feat.  Brian Froud's design work is wonderful, as is to be expected. I kind of wish there were a few more of these kinds of films about these days, but I suppose people can't be bothered, or today's youth are too hardened and desire bloodier entertainment.
Anyway.  My advice is, if you didn't watch it as a kid, stay well away.  But if you have littl'uns of your own (I reckon under 8 yrs old), let them watch it.  There aren't many new fairytales, but this is one of them.",1077926400,2,1146,4.471153846153846

The fact that it incorporated very little feeling... and the awful dynamics and pitch and the background dialogue was stupid, a script written for little kids. Then the unbearable decision to have characters constantly making background noises for no reason, except for the fact that they're there.
Then you have the irritating movement of the muppet characters themselves... just the heads twisting and flying everywhere... looking completely unrealistic and uncontrollable. But... this movie had some really good traits to it as well.
The originality of the storyline was quite enjoyable... as was most of the humor. It has plenty of interesting concepts incorporated into it. I think this movie, if it were redone today, would completely overblow Harry Potter.",1076198400,,917,5.3310344827586205

576968,5,6303122876,"To the person complaining about being too cheap to hire actors... first off, it took you FIVE MINUTES to realize they were puppets??? I can't believe it took you that long. It was never intended to be a conspiracy that they were puppets. I bet anime pissed you off after (5 minutes into it) you noticed the ""actors"" were drawn. I can just imagine how pissed you were when you noticed (taking probably at least 30 minutes this time) the ""actors"" in Final Fantasy were CG. I mean, are these people out to deceive the world with their fake actors??? Who the hell do they think they are??!!! :rolleyes:
Anyways, this is one of the favorites from my childhood, so I'm more than a little jaded about it. That being said though, I do still watch this while there are many other movies I used to watch as a child that I can't without bursting in to fits of laughter.
Pretty much if you liked any or all of these, you'll like this movie: Secret of NIMH, Legend, Labrynth. Especially Labrynth of course.
One of those movies you can feel good about letting your kid watch (and you can enjoy too), as it won't rot out his/her brain like so many other movies geared towards children.",1075420800,2,1170,4.421296296296297
576969,4,6303122876,"I really won't rehash the story here as it can be read in the editorial or other reviews, but I will simply comment on the Collectors Edition DVD and complete package instead.
Foremost, the widescreen transfer was pretty good, but seemed to be lacking the extra re-mastering touch.  I think today we expect DVD CE's to be re-mixed and re-mastered for a crisp picture, brilliant color, and over all visual enhancements.  However, even though the transfer was good, I thought the colors could have been more brilliant at times.
The enclosed 'notepad', while a neat idea, was a little disappointing.  It is a small scale reproduction of some of Jim Henson's notes for the movie during production.  For me, it was a little small to read or enjoy, and most of 'notes' where very fragmented, and maybe only Jim Henson would be able to decipher their actual meanings.
The enclosed film frame is pretty cool.  It is a single frame of the movie sandwiched and framed in very decorative heavy card stock. But it is also very small and not really for young children to enjoy.
DVD Extras and presentation:
1) Documentary was about an hour long and very interesting.  It was a very nice addition to the CE disk.  It was very deep into showing the viewer the movie from concept and design to actual shooting.  Very informative and revealing.  5 stars.
2) Illustration Gallery.  A few nice pics and illustrations, but not really enough to warrant this a special feature.  There may have been all of 8 stills, and with no accompanying text, music or captions, it was nothing special. 1 star.
3) Audio setup: Beware, the default audio setting was 2 channel stereo, which is unusual.  It was only after I watched the movie, and went into the audio menus did I find a 5.1 Dolby track.  Most DVD's today use this as the default or standard.  I thought it was strange that the CE disc used 2 channel as a default. 2 stars.
4) Deleted Scenes: there were a few and they were interesting but not spectacular.  3.5 stars.",1075075200,2,1996,4.614730878186969

The only problem is I'm not a child anymore, the movie didn't do for me today what it did years ago, it was hard for me to follow the story. Most of the characters seem creepy now, and I couldn't make head or tails of what most of the characters were saying, although I remember everything making perfect sense to me when I was a child. It kind of makes me wish I would have left it in my memories as this wonderful visualy stunning movie I remembered from my childhood, rather than the way I view it now as an adult.",1073001600,2,640,3.856060606060606
576971,3,6303122876,"I'm a huge fan of The Dark Crystal (it and Labyrinth are my favourite movies of all time ever) so I was of course thrilled when a special collector's edition was released.  However, I'm disappointed in the ""features"".
Pretty much everything on the disc is the same as what's on the non-collector's edition.  The few new things to me aren't worth it.  Character Illustrations and storyboards are nice and all.  I was excited about ""The Mithra Treatment"", which I thought was the original print of the movie...where the characters speak their own language and not English (you see some of this in the deleted scenes on the disc).  It is not.  It is simply screens and screens of Henson's original notes.  Interesting yes... but I'd rather have that in a booklet, not in screens on my TV.  Then again, the fact that it was only 1 disc should have tipped me off.
The packaging is nice, the replica of Henson's notepad detailing the original ideas which would become the movie is very interesting... but in my opinion, not worth the $35 or whatever I just shelled out for this.
I'm very disappointed in the amount of ""exclusives"" on this DVD.  The original print of the film would have been *amazing* to see, to see how Henson and Co. originally viewed the film.  Maybe some new interviews with some of the other players (Oz and Froud for sure) as they look back on the movie, its box office disappointment but almost cult success.  Or even a nifty booklet with a lot of these extras in it.  I hate sitting in front of my TV trying to read screens of information or look at drawings which I'd rather have on paper so I can see the detail better.
So to make a long story short... if you like the movie, get the regular edition and not collector's.  If you're a fanatic like me, bought the re-issued World of the Dark Crystal book and even considered shelling out a few hundred for the original pressing... and somehow MISSED buying the first DVD release of this movie, well then this is probably for you.  But if you already own the DVD that came out a few years ago... I'd think very heavily on it, unless you are a fanatic.  Even as a fanatic, you probably won't find any new material here (especially if you own the aforementioned book), and I'd save the $35.  Or try to recoup some of your ""loss"" and sell your other DVD somewhere (like I'm going to try and do).  I hope that if Henson and Co. decide to do a Collector's Edition of Labyrinth they put a little more work into it.  I have to say, I'm disappointed with how the kids have carried on Jim's legend.",1070236800,254,2557,4.427350427350428
576972,5,6303122876,"This film was the first film Jim Henson did outside of the muppets and this film is in no way related to that except for the Henson. What's also unusal about this film is that there are no human characters, something we've been used to since the muppet movies and TV shows. It is orginal!
Jen is the last of his kind, a Gelfling. His race was mass murdered by the Skexis, a race that looks like a cross between lizards and spiders, because of an ancient prophecy that says a Gelfling will destroy their race. Jen is taken in by the race of mystics, six armed creatures who are pacifistic wizards. Their leader tells Jen of the prophecy and of how he has to heal the Dark Crystal in order to keep the world from going into darkness forever, sounds Tolkien-ish huh?
Wonderful production design and concepts by Brian Froud make this movie a feast for the eyes. The swamp scene, which is my favorite scene and where Jen meets Kira, reminds me of the Tulgy Wood scene in Alice in Wonderland in the sense that everything is alive!

576976,5,6303122876,"""Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.  A thousand years ago, this land was green and good, until the Crystal cracked.  A single piece was lost, a shard of the Crystal.  Then strife began.  Then two new races appeared:  the cruel Skeksis and the gentle Mystics.""
The ones in power in the Castle of the Crystal are the tall, lumbering Skeksis, a cross between vultures and dinosaurs, putrid lizards, as Aughra calls them.  Some are downright fierce, such as the Garthim Master and Ritual Master, others are comical, such as the Chamberlain who challenges the Garthim Master for the emperor's throne...and loses.  They also must have won the Worst Table Manners by a non-human intelligent species Award, as they burp and make loud smacking noises when eating their roast Nebri.  In contrast, the four armed, tan, silver maned Mystics are more laid back, content in their simple peaceful ways, and despite being pokey upon their travel to the Castle of Crystal, don't underestimate them--they are powerful.
Jen, a Gelfling raised by the Mystics when the Skeksis massacred his people, is the Chosen One.  His journey--I know, Joseph Campbell--is to find the shard and heal the Crystal, and the land, or else the land will become a place of evil for good.  As the prophecy goes, ""When single shine the triple suns, what was sundered and undone, shall be whole, the two made one, by Gelfling hand or else by none.""  So when the Skeksis discover his existence, they press the panic button, so to speak, and sic the Garthim, lumbering black-carapaced crosses between woodlice, sowbugs, and beetles with crustacean claws who make clicking sounds when aroused, after our hero.
In his quest, Jen is helped by Aughra, a squat gray curmudgeon of a harridan with her one removable eye, who lives in an observatory, and Kira, a pretty blonde Gelfling who knows how to communicate with animals via their calls, so it shows not all blondes are dumb, as she proves more resourceful than him, including a significance anatomical difference that saves both their hides later in the movie.  Her pet Fizzgig is the most comical creature, resembling a furry light brown ball that barks, and reveals a mouthful of teeth when it roars.  Jen and Kira complement each other, he has spent his life under the learned Mystics, while she has spent her life at one with nature.
Jim Henson clearly borrowed some Buddhist principles here.  The low-register chant of the Mystics owes a nod to the multiphonic chants practiced by the Tibetan Buddhist monks, as is the sandpainting one of the Mystics does in the early part of the movie.  Then there's Aughra's mindset on what happens if Jen fails in his quest:  ""The end of the world, or the beginning.  All the same, big change.  Sometimes good, sometimes bad,"" which is kind of a Hindu mindset recalling the Shiva/Vishnu relationship, of destruction and renewal.
Another symbolic representation is the image of Aughra's house the Mystic leader shows Jen.  It resembles a brain, which given the orrery in her abode denotes her as the one gifted with scientific knowledge.
Apart from the jungle scenery, it's the creatures that's a real visual triumph, from exotic plants and animals.  The only letdown are the potato-like quiff-haired Pod People, who look like some toys for the 5 and unders.  But of individual creatures, Fizzgig, Kira's pet, steals the show, as does the calculating Chamberlain, with his funny cunning whimper and sickly smile.
Aided by Trevor Jones' sweeping score, The Dark Crystal will be optimal for kids 8 to 11, as those younger may find the Skeksis frightening and even disgusting, but for those into fantasy, people of any age, depending on how well you can take the Podlings.",1068249600,4,3731,4.899841017488076

This movie is a story told entirely by puppets, though they are lightyears beyond the Muppets. The detail on the characters and in the world itself [all created by Jim Henson] is fantastic. The sets are all alive and vital with just enough movement to capture your eye and draw you into the world without taking away from the story.
The plot is driven by simple directives like Good VS Evil on the surface but there is more to the story than that. There are characters in this story that fall somewhere in between in the grey area where good and evil meet. That is the crux of the story. Good and Evil coming together to form one whole being capable of both.
It seems very deep, but don't be afraid.  This story is packed with action and adventure, mystery and love. Buy it. Watch it...over and over....

The story is one of a world in steep decline yet lingering on the brink of renewal, the characters are endearing and beautifully made, and while it lacks Labyrinth's musical numbers by David Bowie, even the music is good.
The puppetry in this is amazing, conveying the personalities and feelings of the characters with, considering that the movie was made in the early 1980s, a suprising amount of facial expressiveness.  Jen and Kira, the Gelflings, are full of warmth and friendliness while the reptilian Skesis are suitably sinister and scheming, the shaman-like Mystics are gentle and contemplative, the Podlings are lively and celebratory even in the face of Skesis opression, and even the mysterious super-fluffy-dog Fizzgig is wonderfully designed.

577043,5,6303122876,"I repeatedly watched this movie as a child and saw it again recently. And, still, I believe this is the best fantasy movie ever made. As Tolkien is to fantasy books, Oz's Dark Crystal is to fantasy movies.
The story is that of Jen and Kira, two young heros who are the only male and female left of their kind. Jen is set with a task to battle against the odds to find a missing shard of the Dark Crystal to be placed into the crystal to make it whole again. All this, in order to restore balance to the world and allow all creatures to live in peace and harmony ever after from the magic-sucking creatures who destroy all. And of course, all of this has to be done before the three suns meet in the sky. In his journey, Jen discovers not only himself, but also meets some interesting and unsavoury characters, as well as the lovely Kira, who joins his quest. Jen needs to decide who to trust and finds himself in some very sticky situations.
The director on this film must have had tremendous patience and vision, since all the characters are puppets. Although initially distracting, we soon forget about the puppetry as we become caught up in the fascinating story. Ne'er have I rooted so hard for a hero. The ending is both sweet and sad at once.
The puppets allow a tremendous amount of creativity for developing all the different kinds of creatures, both good and evil. To some who don't like puppets, this could be kind of scary, but I find this unusual approach refreshing amidst a time when computer generated graffics are often bad and over used. The artistry of something that is created by humans is both touching and charming and has a genuine/honest feel to it.
A predecessor of fantasy film that has yet to be matched by its successors. Truly eloquent. Without doubt, a classic.

577044,5,6303122876,"I saw this movie when it was current in the theaters, having been a fan of Henson and company since the mid-sixties. Back then, they frequently made guest appearances on the Jack Paar Show, Ed Sullivan and then made the rounds to every OTHER talk and variety show you could name at the time. I knew that ANYTHING he and his organization would produce would be impressive, cerebral and unlike anything else in their field. I was right. This movie is pure magic!
Henson and Frank Oz use a combination of finger and hand puppetry; their own creation, the ""muppet"", a combo of marionette and puppet, and body suits to create the characters of this film, a soupcon of elves; potato-like creatures that are as cute as bugs' ears; vulturous beings called Skeksis, long-nosed sloth-like characters called Mystics and Ogra, a cantankerous sorceress that helps the hero, Jen, return a crystal shard to the titular power source deep in the heart of Skeksis territory.
Along his way to do this, he meets Kira, an adorable girl elf of his people, the Gelflings, that helps him survive a lot of the perils on his journey. One of the more horrific parts of this film is a scene where she and a few of the potato-like people, called Podlings, are tortured and drained of their life essence by the Skeksis so that the vulture-like monsters can stay invigorated.
It seems the Gelflings were nearly wiped out by the Skeksis when an ancient prophecy revealed that a lone gelfling would seize power from them somehow. Both Jen and Kira were saved and raised, by the Mystics, in Jen's case, and the Podlings in Kira's. It isn't mentioned where Ogra comes from, but they must have been a DAMNED interesting race! Jen is that gelfling, but it is Kira that finally makes it possible, after all her hardship.
The scene where Kira introduces Jen to her Podling friends is almost worth the price of the tape/DVD.
Why must Jen return the shard? That's explained by the ending and I'm not going to spoil it for you here. Suffice it to say that though Jen is the supposed star of the movie, Kira steals the spotlight from him often, as does Ogra.
The whole production will take you right back to the highest quality family special of the fifties, only this is done much better than any of them! The art direction is as good as ""Legend"", if not better. The puppetry is artistry at its best, setting new standards and bewitching both adult and childish eyes as does the set design, which words cannot describe in some cases.

Jen the Gelfling goes on a important quest to find the shard with the help of a sorceress named Aughra and joins up with a couple of more friends on a mission to heal the crystal or else the world will end.

Brilliant and outstanding fantasy epic from Jim Henson and Frank Oz is definitely their masterpiece! It's an inspiring motion picture that has moved me since i was a kid. Five years in the making for this remarkable fantasy treasure to be made and Henson succeeded, he has created a movie unlike no one has ever made before by not using a single human being to appear on screen to make an alien world come to life. The film was a labor of love using organic material, realistic puppets, animatronics, and a crew of jewelery and woodmakers. The movie uses realistic puppets and animatronics as the cast whom are as realistic as you and me with spectacular settings and a thought provoking story to go with it, dark atmosphere and the brilliant music score by Trevor Jones is one of the most criminally underrated and greatest movie scores around.

This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality that is perfect all the way and the extras are terrific like audio commentary from Brian Froud whom designed the world for the film including the creatures, deleted scenes, alternate workprint scenes, a new featurette, ""The World of the Dark Crystal"" documentary, and character illustration gallery.",1047081600,,2086,4.650406504065041

Into the fantastical world of The Dark Crystal.....
The Skekses rule here, likened to ceremonial Magicians, drawing Power from the glowing Dark Crystal to celebrate & preserve their rule over the land.
The Mystics, sloth-like beings ,who inspire pathos, resemble natural Magicians of the earth, who are also the caretakers of a gelfling, who is basically an elf-like creature, who is prophesied to deliver the world form the ""tyranny"" of the ""evil"" Skekses, a-la Moses, a-la Nazarene.
There are so many wonderful beings herein --- creatures resembling mutated rabbits on stilts {who provide transportation for the Gelflings}, Podlings {a slave race serving The Skekses, also providing with essence to preserve youth for The Skekses --- indeed, nothing is wasted!}, & a little pet called Fizzgig, who is basically a small hairball with teeth.
We meet Okra, who provides some essential clues for the Gelfling quest.

577119,5,6303122876,"The Dark Crystal heralded a new age of puppeteering into the lives of many a young person and their easily influenced minds in the 1980s, showcasing not only the beauty of characters manipulated by a vast array of contraptions and the magic that could be woven on the loom of storytelling but also the dreariness that some legends hold within their epic grasps. This is one of the things I can clearly envision each and every time I look back in wonder on the tale of the Crystal and the ""land that was green and good"" that it lorded over, remembering how the thing came to crack and how the Skeksis began their rule over it.
We join the Skeksis as they gather in a time of transition, one that sees them ushering in a new era as their emperor dies and another will ascend to a place of power. It is also an era that will usher in a renewal of power for these reptilian/birds as well, assuring their reign for another 1000 years if nothing amiss happens before the stars and planets align. Everything seems to be going well for them, too, except for a little prophecy that states that a Gelfling will bring about the a time of transition. Still, there isn't anything to be worried about because all of the Gelflings were killed long ago when this was first heard, right? Well, that's when the last male Gelfling, Jen, enters the picture and the quest to heal the shard begins; one that will lead in down the paths of loss, love, and the conquest of fear.
As far as epic movies go, the Dark Crystal has it all. There are evils to be watched in admiration and their counterparts, the Mystics, to study under a cautious microscope for any sign of weakness, tiny villas full of ""people"" to see, jungles writhing with lifeforms both fascinating and bizarre, and many a support characters to enjoy. Also, the DVD version has The World of the Dark Crystal documentary on it, an informative piece in its own right, and a deleted scene depicting the Skeksis funeral scene.

But then that's how the movie is good, in a certain way. Jim Henson and Frank Oz took a chance and tried something new, creating puppets and landscapes in a dark fantasy movie that recalls both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in its plot and characters.
I have to say that after over twenty years, the movie holds up very well, overall. While some of the bluescreen work is a little iffy, the remastered DVD makes things look better. The puppets are, for the most part, very life-like ( conceptualized by Brian Froud, who would later work with Henson and Oz on Labyrinth ), and the sleight of hand tricks and camera moves ( check out the puppet>human actor>puppet seamless edits ) to disguise the fact that someone's hand was up the characters' asses was quite slick. Some of the best I've seen. Also, Trevor Jones' music score is inviting and epic, and as a DVD feature, can be heard as an isolated track.

He channeled much of this resentment into ""The Dark Crystal,"" which is often too dark for many of the children it was marketed towards.  As a child, however, I was never frightened by the film.  I was awed, mesmerized by it.  Although not wholly succesful in some aesthetic terms (the mouth movements of the Gelflings can be annoyingly badly synced to the actual dialogue), it is a truly beautiful film.  Almost 20 years down the line, and the ending still makes me a little teary.  OK, so I'm a big sap.  But as much as I love the Muppets, and I do, I regret that Jim Henson didn't have more opportunities to stretch his wings into more science fictiony, older audience things like this.

One of my favorite scenes is where the two Gelflings fall over a cliff, the girl spreads her wings, the boy says: ""But I don't have wings"" to which the girl replies: ""Of course not - you're a boy."" The fact is that all the species come across as very real and believable - from the kindly and wise Mystics to the human Podlings to the awful and hideous Skeksis. The meal scene in the Skeksis castle is particularly vivid and memorable, although it's not for the squeamish!

The film begins with a brief narration providing an introduction to the alien world where the lives of its inhabitants are linked to the power of a massive crystal.  Those most influenced by the crystal are the gentle Mystics and the evil Skeksies.  Over the past 1000 years, the Skeksies harnessed the power of the crystal to enslave others, mostly the Gelflings (whom they fear) and the Podlings.  The Skeksies systematically hunted down and destroyed nearly all of the Gelflings because an ancient prophecy foretells that a Gelfling will destroy them.  One Gelfling, Jen, whose family was destroyed by the Skeksies, survives and is found and raised by the Mystics.  The Mystics send him forth on an odyssey to find the crystal shard--a piece of the venerated, powerful crystal.  Jen must find the shard and put it back into the crystal before the world's three suns eclipse one another in a great conjuction.  If the crystal is incomplete at the great conjuction, their world will forever be plunged into darkness; but if the crystal is restored, their world will be reborn.  Jen does not initially fully understand the significance of his quest, but he proceeds and discovers many great and terrible things along the way.  Will Jen succeed?  Let the story of ""The Dark Crystal"" unfold before you and find out!

The disc is an excellent transfer but there are a few imperfections towards the end of the movie which are the result of spots on the original negatives.  I saw them only once, and only for a moment.  The colors are rich but not as brilliant as they were in the theatre, i.e. the scene where the skeksis and mystics are reunited into one being.  The white images of the beings and the castle interior are not as well illuminated as before.  Also the very last scene where the planet is shown in a restored condition is quite bland compared to the vibrance it displayed in the theatre in 1982.

There is an old witch who sounds a lot like Fozzie Bear and Master Yoda - but that's because it is the voice and actions of Frank Oz. Visually it is an interesting film too. The imagery is very dark and filled with character in the sets and costumes.
The DVD contains no real great extras but a simple featurette that explains the making and design of the movie. A lot of work went into it but it wasn't a commercial success either. I don't think really younger kids will get it.

577204,5,6303122876,"Jim Henson was one of the greatest artists and filmmakers of the 20th century. It took awhile for his genius to be appreciated in the United States, but over a decade since his death people are finally beginning to recognize the mastery of his creative mind. For example, THE DARK CRYSTAL. The film had a fairly decent run when it was originally released in theatres in 1982. However, the film wasn't acknowledged or heralded for the creative and complex masterpiece that it is until recently.
THE DARK CRYSTAL was a humongous undertaking. It is a film that takes place in a fantasy world, filled with frightening and mystical creatures; yet does not star one human being. The entire cast of the film consisted of nothing but puppets: some rather large and cumbersome, some that human performers were fitted in, some that were small, some that were animatronic; but all puppets nonetheless. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before and through the work on THE DARK CRYSTAL, Henson pushed puppetry and animatronics to a whole new level.
THE DARK CRYSTAL is about a young male Gelfling (think of an elf, but much smaller) named Jen and the journey he undertakes to save his world from an eternal dominion by a group of dragon-like creatures called Skesis. Jen's entire race was wiped out in a holocaust by the Skesis in an attempt to prevent a 1000 year old prophecy from being fulfilled. Jen is the last of his race, or so he believes. Jen leaves the race of Mystics who have raised the child since his parents' murder and sets forth on a journey to the great Palace to heal the Dark Crystal by inserting The Shard that had been broken from the crystal a millenium ago. Along the way he meets a variety of fantastical creatures from a one-eyed wise woman, the a race of miniture-round-headed people called Podlings, to a female Gelfling named Kira.
The plot of the movie is excellent and is told in the manner of such classic works as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, and THE ODYSSEY. The world that Henson created is one of magic and fantasy, yet the story contains a great deal of Truth within it. It is a tale of adventure, love, sacrifice, and redemption; which speaks to the divinity in us all.
The movie is acceptible for an entire family to watch and contains several morals. However, children younger than five may find some of the creatures frightening. Nevertheless, THE DARK CRYSTAL is a fairy tale and like all true fairy tales, it does not gloss over the fact that evil is an ugly and nasty business. This movie is one of the best by one of the greatest.",1014768000,7,2573,4.595652173913043

So my only complaint,and it's a huge one if you enjoy audio as much as me,is the sound transfer. It seems as though the sound was transferred from some old VHS copy and they didn't bother to digitize it. The dialogue in many scenes seems as if it was recorded inside an aluminum shed,it has a ""scratchy"" sound,for lack of a better word. The bass is virtually non existent,my subwoofer was only engaged about 4 or 5 times,and the rear surrounds were barely utilized at all. When they were,the effect was pitiful,almost a whisper. This is DVD,there was tremendous potential for this film with regards to audio. Especially when we find our young hero travelling through the forest,every speaker should have been in action during that sequence. It should have enveloped me,but instead disappointed and confused.
I would like to know what Columbia-Tristar and Henson studios were thinking,because it's obvious someone made a big mistake in authorizing this inferior transfer. And i don't want to hear that the movie is old,that's no excuse,because Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is even older and the audio on that DVD was remastered and it sounds impeccable.
So,if you don't mind an underwhelming audio mix,and an above average video transfer(i have to agree with another reviewer,some section are scratched and appear blurred),then you can't go wrong with this well executed and highly entertaning fantasy film.

It has been called ""a flawed masterpiece,"" but in my eyes it is one of the best fantasy movies ever made.

When I finally got around to viewing it a few months later, I was stunned and amazed:  Jim Henson and Frank Oz didn't simply make a full-length movie starring Muppets; no, they created a whole new world in much the same way George did did with STAR WARS. Instead of sci-fi, this movie is classic fantasy, with old/wise men, innocent young hero/heroine, and reptilian-like villian characters abounding in a world that can only be described as unique and spectacular. It takes you back to a time in your youth where all you needed was a fantasy tale like this to take you away and make you dream of things greater (and more interesting) than the day-to-day existence of real life. This film captures those youthful yearnings perfectly.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the famous Muppet team of Henson and Oz could create a whole new WORLD with their art.  They suceeded marvelously at bringing us the story of the wise, peace-loving Mystics and their quest to restore balance to the world ruled by the ugly, cynical, reptilian Skeksis. The Mystics' only hope is in the orphaned Gelfling boy Jen, who is sent out to recover the final shard of the Dark Crystal, which will restore peace and balance to the world.  That is the entire plot of this film, and it is all the plot it needs, because its purpose is to have us follow the boy along on his adventures, and share in what he experiences.  Of course, it is also about style, and THE DARK CRYSTAL has plenty of that.

The characters are designed by the wonderful fantasy artist Brian Froud, and each seems to have a soul of it's own.  The sound track is chilling, the scenery is spectacular, and the voice-over actors are perfect.
The critics who panned the script as 'shallow' were obviously not sensitive to how moving a simple, neatly-crafted story can be.
I have never seen another movie that has drawn me so completely into it's world.  A few more films like this would do us all good.",1001894400,4,824,4.510067114093959

577386,5,6303122876,"i saw this film when it first came out on video, i was a mere six years old. I loved it so much my parents immediately bought the film for me and i watched it every weekend throughout my childhood years. I cannot stress how much i worshipped this film! I wanted to BE both Jen and Kira as they went through the beautiful landscapes and avoided the Skeksis in their quest to restore the crystal shard to the Dark Crystal itself. Now, 15 years on, i have finally seen the DVD version of the film.  I bought a DVD player purely for this very purpose and it was worth it. Even though i have bought new copies of the VHS over the years (and grown up a bit i hope) i was still amazed at how much better the film looked in the format. Brian Froud's imagery is wonderful and the Henson puppets are superb even if they are getting on for 20 years old and the story is moving, scary and totally enchanting. Maybe i am slightly biased as this was already my favourite film - quite clear if you knew me with my intentional resemblance to Kira, crystal bat 'body art' (temporary tattoos to you), Brian Froud-esque bedroom and all the purple crystals that pop up in my art work :). But this aside, for all you Dark Crystal fans out there SEE THIS VERSION, it really is worth a look and if you've never seen the film before and you won't be put off by the lack of guns and explosions in it check it out, please, its beautiful.

577389,5,6303122876,"Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal is a visual muppet masterpiece.  Taking three years to make and going way over budget, the Dark Crystal hit theaters with mixed reviews.  As time moved on The Dark Crystal became a cult sleeper and is now loved by many people.  The story is the classic mythological journey story of growth and healing.  A gelfling, Jen, is one of the last of his kind to go out into the land of the dark crystal to find the shard that will heal the power source that tore its planet apart. Besides healing the crystal, Jen learns much about who he really is and the kind of people the gelfings use to be. The cruel Skeksis and gentle Mystics are beautifully crafted each in their own image to match their personality.  The pod people are an uplifting event admist the stress that is placed upon the main character.  The beauty of the planet, the wonder of the characters, and the story itself will take a person away for close to an hour and a half.
Aside from the movie, this DVD is special because it offers a completely instrumental track by composer Trevor Jones.  Since the soundtrack is no longer readily available, this little instrumental addition to the DVD allows the listener to feel the wonder of the film through the music alone.

The story of Jen, who in his mind is supposed to be the only remaining Gelfling alive, finds the biggest task of his life begins at a young age. The story has an excellent plot with a very detailed storyline. The wonder and the astonishing visual affects that Henson incorporates into this beautiful story are excellent. Jen goes through various trials throughout the course of the movie, including having to deal with the loss of his family and his mentor, the elder mystic, the Mystics are considered as the wise one's of the world where the Skeksis are the evil counterparts linked to the mystics by that of the Dark Crystal, shattered long ago by the beings who kept the Crystal of Truth.

The deleted sequences offer some insight into new aspects of the film.  The Skesis funeral sequence juxtaposes interestingly against the laid back acceptance of death by the Ur'ru.  The featurette although dated offers some wonderful insight into the development of the film.

Finally seeing this movie in its original aspect-ratio is the primary advantage of this release of the film.  (To my knowledge, it has never been available on VHS in its original format.)  Additionally, the disc contains many valuable bonus features, including behind-the-scenes documentaries, an isolated musical score, and deleted scenes.  The content of this product is very complete and satisfying to anyone who loves this film.
One of the chief characteristics of DVD (!!DIGITAL!! Video Disc), is its high-resolution and consequential picture and sound fidelity.  I would have expected that, with the transition of the film to DVD, the pulishers would have the decency to give it the ol' buff  and polish.  While the sound seems to be quite flawless, the picture is not.  Tell-tale dirt and grime intrude upon many frames, just as if the viewer were watching it at the movie theatre with its dusty projector.
Admittedly, I am unaware of the specific costs and benefits of film restoration; maybe George Lucas restored the Star Wars Trilogy because he is rich and loves his creation--and Star Wars has (as of the date of this review) only VHS availability!  I would have gladly paid an additional ten or fifteen dollars for The Dark Crystal to be restored to its original glory.

577395,4,6303122876,"Given there are so few good fantasy movies out there, it might be necessary to go back time twenty-one years to find one that is half way decent. The Dark Crystal will always remain one of my favorite films, even in light of more modern fantasy films. I get more out of it than Dragonheart or the D&D movie. I got more out of a migraine than I did out of the D&D movie. I think the reason that there are so few fantasy films made, regardless of quality, is because film makers in Hollywood haven't a clue how to handle them, as for the most part they are made by people who have little or no experience in the genre. It certainly can't be the expense given the plethora of science fiction movies that have been released in the same amount of time. Or maybe it's because SF is more easily accessible by the public than fantasy. Time will tell seeing as we are so near the release of Peter Jackson's first installment of the Lord of the Rings. If it tanks, then I suspect the genre will be dead as far as movies are concerned.
The Dark Crystal is the brain child of Muppeteers Jim Henson and Frank Oz, both of whom share Director credits on the film. Henson is known for Kermit the Frog and the Muppet Show, while Oz, a veteran of the Muppet Show is probably best known for the voice of Yoda from the Star Wars movies. The film is done entirely with puppets, without a live actor to be seen anywhere- somewhat ambitious for the time, and I think that might have been the Dark Crystal's problem: without any real actors seen by the audience, they may have had a hard time relating to the characters they saw. But even if that was the case for the film's box office failure, one cannot help but to be enchanted and enthralled by the film's overall dream-like qualities. Everything has a definite other-world feel, truly alien, and this is where it succeeds.
The world of the Dark Crystal has spent a thousand years in darkness when a race of near god-like beings, the Ur'Skeks, conducted an experiment with a great crystal artifact. The experiment failed and as a result the Ur'Skeks were split into two faces: the vile, diseased Skeksis and the gentle, wise Uru. Through the ages they have all but died off, until there are only ten on each side. With each Skeksis linked to its counterpart Uru-what affects one affects the other. There is also a prophecy that says a gelfling (i.e. an elf) will heal the crystal and restore the world to its proper order. The gelfling in this case is Jen, one of the last of his race and raised by the Uru for a time when he would be needed to fulfill the prophecy.
When single shines the triple sun
What was sundered and undone
Shall be whole again
The Two made One
By Gelfling hand
Or else by none
Now, I like prophecies about as much as I like Republicans-both override any concept or notion of free will, but it can be accepted in this case. Jen must find Augra-a Yoda-like old woman who several fake shard pieces as well as the real one, and leaving it to Jen to determine which is the right one. After obtaining the crystal shard he meets Kira, a female gelfling, who was raised by a gnome-like race known as pod people. It falls to Jen and Kira to travel to the castle of the Dark Crystal before the Great Conjunction occurs so that he may plunge the dagger like shard into the crystal. As he travels the Uru begin an arduous trek to the castle themselves for a final confrontation with their other halves.
The look of the film is awesome-perhaps one of the imaginative films ever lensed. Production design fell to fantasy illustrator Brian Froud whose surreal and ethereal artwork has influenced every aspect of the film-from the Uru to the Skeksis, the architecture and the animals-none of them look like anything we have on our world, and blended seamlessly into a gorgeous sensory experience that has captivated me for nearly twenty years. Froud published a book-The World of the Dark Crystal, and it features much of his art and narrated by Augra as though she had written the text. It's out of print by now, but if you have an interest in the film, I highly recommend it as a companion peace to the film.
There is little I don't like about the film, except for perhaps the pacing, which is a little slow and seems a little disjointed at times. Though that may be the fault of poor editing. The music is wonderful-epic and powerful with eerie underpinnings that accentuates the film perfectly. Trevor Jones should be applauded for his work on the score. This film is magical in most every way- it is true fantasy, and as much as I love Xena, doesn't have a single sword wielding woman in a chain mail bikini. Indulge yourself, good fantasy is so hard to find these days.",982108800,6,4713,4.4308755760368665

The story isn't bad.  The plot is predictable and the music is no different from any other movie that aspires to be the epic story of prophecy fulfilled.  But you can't tear your eyes from the film because of its beautiful, richly-detailed world.  Jim Henson and his team made thousands of puppets and props for the movie.  They were succesful in creating a perfectly-delivered,  believable fantasy world with distinguished characters you could care about set in intriguing, original environments.

Though ruling their world, which seems lush and dying at the same time, the Skeksis remain in the dread of two things - the noble mystics and the human-like Gelflings.  Divining their doom at the hands of the Gelflings, the Skeksis cruelly exterminate them.  But the mystics, who seem to resemble navaho medicine men as benevolent turtles, offer a more complex threat to the skeksis.  Saved from the Skeksis oppression, a young Gelfling is told of the prophecy and sets forth for the evile Skeksis' ruined castle to bring their evil reign to an end and return his world to peace.
It's a pretty simple story, but Jim Henson's artistry makes it all inviting, with charachters that seem ready to prove that they're no muppets.  The fantasy world seems to have no end of menace and beauty.

As the leader of the Mystics lies on his deathbed, he charges hapless Gen with the quest to ""heal the Crystal"". Simultaneously, the Emperor of the Skeksis dies, resulting in a struggle for the throne in the face of impending fate...
Not counting the scenery, everything in Dark Crystal is superficial. The few characters in the film completely lack development, and plot is only skin-deep. And yet, as is the case with its kin, ""Labyrinth"", sheer ambience carries the viewer and makes the film marginally entertaining. What separates ""Dark Crystal"" from ""Labyrinth"" is the almost complete lack of likeable characters, which is possibly linked with the lack of any human actors. Gen's face is oddly distorted, like a baboon's, and, sadly enough, the near total lack of personality (is whining a personality?) allows his outer appearance to dominate the character.

577414,4,6303122876,"Long have I loved The Dark Crystal, and when I got the DVD as a gift (my first DVD!), frankly, I was apprehensive. I hadn't seen the movie in years, until this past summer, when I rented the videotape and was appalled by the quality: the murky picture, the incomprehensible composition of many scenes, and the slow pacing. Would the DVD simply present digitally-clear proof of all these complaints?

Nope! This is a feast for the eyes, a creative masterpiece.

Okay, first off, I'll say that the pacing *is* slow, and that's the biggest flaw in this film. My only other issue, brought to light by the sharp DVD picture, is that the hero puppets, the Gelflings, are relatively unexpressive -- their facial features change very little. Perhaps that was the limited state of the art for a humanlike puppet in the early 1980s. It's ironic, because every other creature in this fantasy world (excepting the beasts of burden: Landstriders, Garthim) is delightfully expressive, from the simple Pod People to the wonderful conniving Skeksis Chamberlain. But then, I've read the same about Star Wars, even: Heroes tend to be plain and undetailed because we are meant to project our own traits upon them. Still, I'd have appreciated even a basic facial expression, a simple smile or frown, but the Gelflings don't have it.

But don't get me wrong: Those are minor complaints. I love this movie. I almost gave up on it after the atrocious VHS rental experience, but the DVD restored my faith and then some. If the pacing is slow, it is a boon in disguise, because it allows you more time to absorb the visual detail. And The Dark Crystal is loaded with detail; this is a complete fantasy world, inspired by Brian Froud (of the book ""Fairies"") and constructed by Jim Henson's shop. The widescreen frame is necessary (it's the only aspect ratio included) -- after seeing this DVD, I can't imagine watching the movie in TV pan 'n' scan format. Every shot is a dreamlike panorama. And the color is truly vibrant.

The sound, as well, is excellent, and the isolated music soundtrack option provides for an even more mysterious and compelling experience. The bonus material is sometimes weak (e.g., overdesigned character-photo screens with terse descriptions), but the saving grace is the documentary piece. It's an extensive look at the conception and making of the movie, and it features the most footage of Jim Henson I've ever seen in one place. The Dark Crystal was in many ways the crown jewel of Henson's achievements, and it's fitting that he gets the chance to talk so much about it. Plenty of interviews with other production people, too, including Frank Oz. (At one point, Henson and Oz are seen discussing a storyboard, and if you close your eyes, it's eerie -- you could swear it's Ernie and Bert.) Truly a treat for Henson fans. For the many who waited decades for a definitive collector's release of The Dark Crystal, it's a dream come true.

Note: I wouldn't recommend this film for young children. I'd say it's best for later grade-schoolers, especially fantasy-oriented ones (I can imagine a revival among the Harry Potter crowd). But don't assume that because it's from Henson it's another Sesame Street preschooler romp: The Dark Crystal has some frightening scenes, elements of macabre horror, and even murder. I'm saving this one until my kids are older -- and then, boy, am I going to love watching it with them.",975801600,20,3419,4.82764505119454

577604,5,6303122876,"The film itself is an undisputed touchstone in the development of cinema fantasy. Its art direction, technical wizardry, and mesmerizing spell make it a classic of entertainment as well as a piece worthy of study.  Why buy this on DVD?  Firstly, the transfer from film is excellent.  I'd become used to the muddied prints used for television and my own VHS copy. The DVD offers vibrancy and sumptuous sound.  Let me put it this way: The DVD restores to reality the memory I have of this film as a child sitting in a dark theater.  As for the extras, the documentary is one that has gotten periodic play on PBS. Still, it's worth seeing again just to watch the complexity of the project. The effort needed to create this production was immense. Of course, the end result is breathtaking -- all the more reason to see the documentary and let you mind be boggled.  The deleted scenes are a hoot (especially the ""original"" language workprint), though the transfer is poor due to the state of the original film.  If you are a friend of the fantasy genre, you need to own this on DVD.",973209600,3,1078,4.525773195876289
577605,5,6303122876,"Those who haven't seen The Dark Crystal have been missing out on what may be the greatest live-action fantasy film of all time (or at least the  '80s). A completely alien world is presented as vivid, believable reality  via the deceptively ""simple"" technique of puppeteering. The  result is very unlike a Muppet film as some might expect, much more like  something truly out of this world; it is a storybook brought to life. The  tale is simple and enjoyable enough for children, but deep and layered  enough for adults as well.
Fans of the movie should own this DVD not just  for the exceptional crispness of the picture and the virtues of the  ultra-widescreen format (2.35:1) but for the bonus materials. In particular  the documentary explaining the production process gave me a whole new  appreciation for the difficulty of making this film, and the incredible  artistry and talent that was poured into it. The complexity of getting  everything to work just right seems to have given the piece a strong sense  of unity; the creature effects don't fight the plot nor do the characters  fail to convey emotion in ways ordinary actors might. Because the technical  challenges of working entirely with puppets have been somewhat scrapped in  favor of CGI over the last decade, I think we're unlikely ever to see  another movie like it--more's the pity.
If you liked the movie on VHS,  buy the DVD. If you just like fantasy and would like to see a worthy film  in the genre, buy the DVD. If you're a fan of the late Jim Henson's work  and want to see something different from his other stuff, buy this DVD.  This one is worth every penny.",967852800,18,1638,4.67719298245614
577606,5,6303122876,"Filmed entirely using puppets from the late Jim Henson's own workshop, the movie is steeped in fantastical lore in which no human appears.  It centers  around a young Gelfling named Jen, who believes he is the last of his kind.  He soon discovers he is not alone when he meets another Gelfling named  Kira who has been hidden away.  In the process he learns that he is the one  prophesized to save his planet by restoring a mystical crystal to its  original state before the aligning of planets brings about the rule of the  Skeksis (vulture-like feral creatures who have no qualms about destroying  one another to stay in power.)  So begins his quest to search for the  legendary Dark Crystal.
The late Jim Henson (along with his now famous  Creature Shop) created a mythical visual masterpiece, helped along by Brian  Froud's breathtaking conceptual designs.

The plot was very predictable, which isn't a problem sometimes, because movies have to run a specific way.  I understand that. BUT, the journey TO the end of the plot wasn't worth  taking! I felt like I was begging it to just be OVER! Not only that, the  special effects were ho-hum, there was absolutely NO dramatic tension, the  main character is a little brat. Here's an example. He's journeying with a  little dog-thing, and it just helped unbury him from a big pile of rocks.  It starts barking. He shushes it. It starts barking again.

It had a very interesting history at its core, but one to which we earth folk can relate: the struggle of the meek against the oppressor. It is a classic tale  re-told on a planet whose life-force has been tragically torn apart  centuries ago. This schism resulted in two kinds of beings, one shallow and  power-hungry, the other gentle and wise. With the former in control of  whatever lay in their vision, the wise people live far from away, where  they have conscientiously raised a special boy to fulfill a prophesy of  world-restoration. Themes like this have been seen throughout our hstory  and the ""history"" of this film is a very sharp and interesting  protrayal of an age-old idea. I highly recommend it.

This has to be one of Jim Henson's greatest children's movies of his career. It incorporates adult themes into a  language that children can easily understand and its dark ambience conveys  the seriousness of the story and the mood in which it should be viewed. The  puppets and animatronics were done very well for its time, and those  puppets are probably sitting now in his creature shop, part of a vast  museum of his wonderful creativity. The story focuses on the relentless  battle between good and evil and the unlikely hero that will save the world  from its darkest demons. There's a wonderfully gifted cast of voices for  the Skeksies and the Mystics, and the score is moving and befitting to the  story.

 The story is your standard quest, and while some of the dialogue and voices  may come off as somewhat cartoonish (I do wish the creators had stuck with  the original Skeksis language), the true strength of the film is in it's  visuals.  Simply put, the film is a feast for the eye, and the imagination.  Every scene is chock full of detailed objects or odd creatures. You'll  likely find yourself wishing the camera would linger on a scene a bit  longer just so you can study the detail. Hats off to not only Henson and Oz  for bringing us this film, but also to Brian Froud for the amazing designs.  It's amazing to see his artwork transferred so easily from paper to the  screen.
 Not only is it a great film, but the DVD package is one of the  best I've seen. The print is crystal clear (no pun intended) and sounds  great.  The disk is jammed with plenty of extra goodies as well, like a  collection of alternate or deleted scenes, and a fascinating  behind-the-scenes documentary. There's also a music-only track that allows  you to take in the visuals without distraction. All it's missing is a  commentary track, but I suppose we can't have everything.
 Obviously the  package was put together by someone who cared for the material, and is a  perfect testament to Jim Henson's genius. This is a film that both children  and parents can enjoy together, and should be part of every DVD collection.",957830400,7,1548,4.528985507246377

Nevertheless, that is not the centerpoint of the plot and the entire film.  Dark Crystal is good fantasy at the highest point in its evolution. Rather  than creating an extrremely complex plot that will ultimately crush  everyone's brain stems, Jim Henson created a world. Populated entirely by  imaginary races (no humans, not even puppets), the world is so atmospheric  and so enthralling in its sheer scintillating liveliness that one has no  choice but sit and be fascinated. The craftsmanship is simply divine (I am  still trying to figure out how Eugra's orrery, the celestial contraption in  her cave, was originally done). This is an excellent fantasy film which  does not find itself too high-brow for the average fantasy lover, and does  not descend into the fluffy cuteness or simplicity of pseudo-fantasies.

So few films immerse you in a completely other world so well.  It is a classical tale of good and  evil.  This story sees Jen and Kira, last of the elf-like Gelfling race, on  a journey to the Palace of the grotesquely evil  Skeksis in order to heal  the fractured Dark Crystal.  It is a simple enough story for young chidren  to grasp, yet pertinent enough to engross adults.
This is not your  typical Jim Henson fare.  Incredibly real and life-like, every creature in  the film was brought to life by puppeteers.  Some of the creatures and  situations are rather frightening and could give a young child nightmares.  Giant, black, crab-like soldiers called Garthim are shown breaking suddenly  into peaceful areas and causing panic and destruction.  There are scenes of  evil, vulture-like Skeksis torturing defenseless Podlings (little gnome-ish  people).  The Skeksis also have sharp, jagged teeth and some make menacing  noises.  I watched this film countless times as a young child, and while  the creatures were frightening, I don't remember ever being afraid to watch  the film.  This is a film which does not underestimate the viewer's ability  to think and wonder.
The wise, peaceful, four-armed Mystics are as  fascinating a film creature as any I've ever seen.  The lush, other-worldly  settings and beings of The Dark Crystal will continue to fascinate me as  they have done all my life.

Be aware, folks, that this movie is NEVER anything like you have ever seen before! It is the true realm of deeply profound  creativity featuring a very alien world where no human ever set foot upon.  In fact, it is very full of the most fantastic creatures and landscape you  will ever see since the old days of Star Wars. However, I do not think this  high fantasy is intended for everyone, including impressionable young kids  and anyone else who is not open-minded enough because it is quite full of  very horrific scenes where a shaggy old witch literally takes an eyeball  right out of its socket to take a better look around; a dying emperor of  the evil bird-like monsters whose face fell apart just like a crumbling  cookie; and the very flesh of helpless victims in a mad scientist's  laboratory sniveling up like rotten old tomatoes. So if you are parents of  young children, please screen it first before buying it for them.

However, I simply was not moved or affected by the film at all.  I don't  think the story is its strong point.  There are prophecies, saving the  world, and magic.  But it's almost as if the script is some textbook  example of what elements to incorporate in order to call a film a  ""fantasy"".  I never felt connected to the main characters, the  Gelflings. So I never care what happens to them at the end.
And my final  complaint are the ""bad guys"" - the Skekses (or however you spell  it!).  I found them simply annoying.  They are the most Muppet-like and  least successful as creatures.
I was very excited to see this film again  - it'd been a while since I'd experienced it.  It was a bit of a let down.  However, there is no denying that Henson & company tred new ground with  THE DARK CRYSTAL.  The work is simply amazing.  I just had a few qualms  with the story.

Although it came out in the early 80's, I only just saw it a few years ago.  I couldn't believe it  was made so long ago, and that I had not really heard of It before.  This  one is deffinatly worth seeing, and then owning.  The animation of these  ""puppets"" is so real, you'll forget that your watching a  fairytale, and feel hipnotized into the world of the Dark Crystal.",943920000,2,493,4.11578947368421
577965,5,6303122876,My wife and I saw this movie in the theater when it was released and loved it. We waited and waited for it to come out on VHS. I bought our DVD player sort of without letting her (my wife)know. She was not real pleased...  until I brought home this disc. The clarity and colors are even more  stunning on the TV screen then we remember them and the 5.1 soundtrack  raises the hair on the back of your neck with surround realism. Thanks to  the Dark Crystal I am no longer in the dog house. NOW ...about that larger  monitor  ... ...hhmmmmmmmm.,941846400,2,543,4.223300970873787

The Never Ending Story,  Labrynith, Legend, and The Dark Crystal.  These are beautiful movies,  beautiful stories, and the way a good story and movie should be.  Definately, by all means, get your kids (and yourself) these movies.  They  will never be forgotten!",941068800,,528,4.591397849462366

Oh, and to get the audio track to work, click  on the Isolated Audio track option on the menu, then click the Start Movie  option in the main menu to start the film.  I remember seeing The Dark  Crystal on HBO WAAAAAYYYY back in the early 1980s and it blew me away.  Over 10 years later, I rediscovered The Dark Crystal on VHS and was once  amazed at the world Jim Henson and Brian Froud created.  Now, after years  of begging The Jim Henson Company to re-release the rare 1990 Image  Laserdisc edition of the Dark Crystal (Rumor has it that Jim Henson himself  personnaly supervised the Laserdisc edition before he died), we finally  have the Dark Crystal on DVD.  Now I know some people out there are crying  over the colors and audio on the film.  Yes, I admit it could be improved  some what......but who cares.  To me, this editon has better quality than  the old Disney version that was released back in 1994.  Anyway this is THE  definative edition of the Dark Crystal I will cherish forever.  Now if only  we could know if that Dark Crystal prequel rumor is true..........",939859200,,1257,4.440528634361233
578030,3,6303122876,I was disappointed in the movie basically because I loved it so much as an 9 year old I thought it would be just as good now.  It isn't.  Not to mention I felt as if the colors were not very well transfered to DVD.,939772800,,214,3.7333333333333334

The widesreen remastered print is beautiful and blows all other copies of  this moive out of the water. Buy this DVD and watch pure movie magic!!

578104,3,6303122876,"I didn't buy this dvd to criticize it or take it apart. I bought it to own it and enjoy it---like most people. This is my absolute favorite movie. I looked forward to seeing all of the new features being released about this  movie. The special features were incredible---the work prints, the clips,  the trailers, character profiles,the deleted scenes----all of that was  pretty magical to me.  The problem that I had was with the overall quality  of the movie itself.  The sound was not top notch, and the movie was  entirely too dark----NOT the content(I love this movie!)I'm talking about  the color of the characters, backgrounds, etc...it seemed to have been  re-issued in a darker finish. The biggest disappointment, was that the  original soundtrack was not on the dvd as stated---there was an option to  choose it, called ""isolated music score"", but when you choose it,  you just get sent back to the beginning of the dvd menu. The other problem  that really messed-up the whole movie----certain colors were changed. For  instance: the color of the crystal became purple instead of that murky wine  color. Next, when the crystal was healed, after the rock and crust fall  from the walls, the brilliant white crystalline walls of the castle are no  longer white---the dvd shows these walls in brown---they seemed faded; not  how they were portrayed in the original. Next, when the Urskeks ascend to  their higher realm, they meld together and are swept into this beautiful  funnel of white energy and carried through the triangular portal over the  crystal. In the dvd, however, someone changed the white color of the energy  into GREEN; a serious contrast---it was so obvious. That was terrible.  Lastly, the sound dips and waves in two places----immediately after Kira is  brought back to life by the Urskek...right after her head moves. And the  sound also fluctuates at the exact point where the Urskeks disappear  through the triangle portal...right when the end music hits its climax. The  reason why I know so many of the flaws is because I have the laserdisk that  was put out a couple of years ago, and I played them both at the same  time---mirrored---I flipped back and forth just to see if my assumptions  were right.. There were major differences. The quality was just not there  for it being a re-issue. By all means---if you like this movie, then buy  the dvd---it's great to have and watch. Just understand that the money that  you are paying for this is strictly for the special features and not for  the movie itself. I never criticize things just to criticize. I don't  believe in nit-picking every little detail. This is simply not the Dark  Crystal that I have grown to know and enjoy. I firmly believe that if  you're going to take the time to bring back something so popular and  special to so many people, why do it halfway? Do it right, and make it big.",939686400,67,2885,4.776876267748479
578105,5,6303122876,I first saw the Dark Crystal about ten years ago and it knocked me off my feet.  After so long I have finaly found a copy and it has definately stood the test of time.

578107,5,6303122876,"When I was 8 years old I saw a magazine promoting ""The Dark Crystal"" and the pictures TERRIFIED me. The Skeksis scared me. The Elders scared me. Even the Podlings and the Elves scared me. I think the  only creature in the whole picture that didn't frighten me was Fizzgig.  When it came out, my parents very much wanted to see it, but I definitely  did not. It actually came down to me hiding in my tree house for hours the  day we were supposed to see it. Unfortunately, they found me. We went, but  all I can remember of the experience is abject terror. I covered my eyes  for a lot of the film, I think. But I got through it and grew up a healthy,  normal person. Now I enjoy Tolkien and that brand of storytelling (I think  Henson's ""The Storyteller"" was one of the best shows ever to  grace TV), but for some reason ""The Dark Crystal"" still makes me  flinch a bit. I like the movie. I really do. I think it's great. I'd like  to buy this DVD but I'm afraid it might give me a complex even having it in  the house. Maybe I should seek help...Just keep all of this in mind when  deciding whether or not to show it to your kids.",937008000,4,1130,4.081818181818182

The story has a discernable start and a realistic (if an animatronic muppet movie can be  realistic) if all too soon ending.  The characters are at least likeable,  and most are loveable!  Augre was truly one of the best put-together  characters in almost any movie I've seen. . .  There's something to being  able to create a character to match their ""character"".  One can  definitely see the influence of Jim Henson's studios in FARSCAPE, and this  is FARSCAPE'S Great Grandfather!  Very Hobbit-esque. . .

578190,5,6303122876,"The Dark Crystal is undoubtedly the most inspiring tale of courage ever portrayed in a children's fantasy adventure. After countless viewings from childhood through to adulthood, Jim Henson's films have inspired me with  his flawless mastering of the puppets.  The courage of Gen and Kira in  comparison to the evilness of the Skeksis keeps the interest alive  throughout the film.  The scenery and props are a fantastic backdrop when  there is dialogue and provides a framework so realistic that the viewer  feels that they are travelling with the characters.
The Podlings  demonstrate just how diverse in appearance the puppets can be, adding  realism by nuances as well as the interesting speech.  In much the same  way, the Garthums embellish all that is evil and serves evil in the  Skeksis.  Jim Henson's portrayal of their greed, pride and vanity is a  clever device in showing the viewer how divided human nature is with the  Mystic's being all that is good and just.
The Dark Cystal is a must for  children and adults alike which can teach us all a moral lession.  Most of  all though, Jim Henson has created a masterpiece of cinematics which I  believe will remain an all-time classic.",935020800,,1195,4.885
