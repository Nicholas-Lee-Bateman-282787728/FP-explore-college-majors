8275165,2,B0019SSDPQ,"Low low budget wannabe horror film in the vein of early 'Saw' movies; or going back further, 'And then there were none'. Tropey, cliched story about strangers that are guests to some unseen host. They are all there to play a game in order to win money. Little do they know it is a snuff game, and the only millionaires are the ones betting on who will die next.

Acting is horribly shallow, death scenes are fake, there are absolutely NO special effects, much less CGI. Looks like a bad stage production, not a film. What a waste of time.",1519603200,,538,4.38
8275166,1,B0019SSDPQ,This movie was awful!  The description indicates that it received 'rave reviews'' - for what!?!  The acting was atrocious and the dialog was worse.  There is not a single thing about this movie that I enjoyed.,1483747200,,209,4.75
8275167,1,B0019SSDPQ,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, fight scene was a joke, ending was awful, I want my time back from watching this piece of crap.",1482796800,,135,4.037037037037037
8275168,2,B0019SSDPQ,"They took a great idea and just missed so many marks, in fact all of them. Was this a high school project of one of children of the owners of Amazon? Maybe this would explain how this ""film"" got on Amazon Prime?",1482796800,,211,4.0476190476190474
8275169,3,B0019SSDPQ,I thought the premise was very original and compelling however the acting was so poor that it was distracting from the impact of the movie.,1480723200,,139,4.6
8275170,5,B0019SSDPQ,"Very different and original theme. Unfortunately, a plausible story. Some pretty strong language in places but fits the characters. Great suspense and an interesting ending.",1478563200,,173,5.96
8275171,5,B0019SSDPQ,It's worth watching again,1436400000,,25,5.5
