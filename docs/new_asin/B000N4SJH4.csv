8174797,4,B000N4SJH4,"Admittedly, Jeanne d""Arc au bcher is a work that neither fits  into operatic or oratorio repertoire very tidily. It lacks a strong linear narrative, using more typically cinematic devices such as flashblack. My take on the performance was that it had a strong sense of ritual or resembled a medieval mystery play.
It is a musical work that I've known for many years- this is the first time I've seen a production and I was more willing to forgive the static and ritualistic nature of the staging. And although on slight acquaintance it might seem to be a series of disconnected musical episodes, there is actually a strong foundation of musical architecture underlying it.
One problematic aspect is the work draws deeply from the well of French of culture and spirituality and can appear rather opaque to an audience unfamiliar with the language, history, or Joan as the symbol of a unified France.
I found some of the sound engineering aspects less than ideal. While it's a document of a live performance, the climactic appearance of Mary's voice was undercut by its lack of audibility- she should soar above the ensemble. The other solo singing voices also suffered this lack of clarity to varying degrees. however, the children's voices were nicely balanced.
Well, a problematic piece- do you go with a stark, somewhat minimalist stage approach or do you go whole hog with glittery tinsel angels and fire projections on scrims (as did some excerpts posted on Youtube from a performance from Palermo)?
Regardless, I'm glad that a video version even exists at all and would give it a fourth star for that.",1316390400,7,1606,4.882783882783883
8174798,3,B000N4SJH4,"A 'multi-media' production, beginning with film footage of the devastation of France after WW1, featuring actress Sylvie Testud as Jeanne d'Arc and Eric Ruf as Dominic, in speaking roles, plus assorted singers on and off stage, two choirs in costumes and masks on stage, and an occasionally visible orchestra! And yet, it feels and sounds quite static. Honegger's score is barely more than dramatic fragments. Paul Claudel's poetic libretto is plainly intended to express the rapture of purification through martyrdom, but unless you are already a rapt believer, you're unlikely to be swayed by such static characterization along with such overwrought symbolism.

As I was watching this DVD, I couldn't help thinking of the great Medieval French 'multi-media' masterpiece, the Roman du Fauvel. There isn't a single staged performance of 'Fauvel' on DVD, that I know of. How I wish this company's energy had gone into such a staging rather than this unlively oddity!",1245110400,,965,5.266233766233766
