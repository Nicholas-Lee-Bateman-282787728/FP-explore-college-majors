8091550,1,B000BRBAM4,Had a DVD cleaner in the box. No Aquarium DVD at all. Tricked again.  Just will play you for a sucker,1454716800,,101,3.8095238095238093
8091551,5,B000BRBAM4,Nightime Video .. great.  Not if I can find out the features on my machine. It would be more sound bites.,1356566400,,105,4.0
8091552,1,B000BRBAM4,"The scene shown on the box is *not* the scene on the DVD.  The actual scene (although it is in HD) is much less colorful.  It also seems like the video is on a fairly short loop because you see the same fish doing the same thing over and over again.  The music is so-so, there are much better ambient CDs if that is what you are looking for.",1133049600,18,341,3.9130434782608696
8091553,1,B000BRBAM4,"Caution on this one, just got it in the mail and it has only one aquarium scene a freshwater scene. NOT a saltwater one as pictured on the box, and even the freshwater scene is not that great anyways. If your into suthing music buy it for that. 8 different tracks for one lousy scene and the pic is not to great either.  There are other DVD's out there for a better price and content.",1132185600,18,384,4.12
