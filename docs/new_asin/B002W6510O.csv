8382897,1,B002W6510O,"I purchased this DVD hoping to use it in my middle school geography class.  I started to preview it, but quickly lost interest.  The background music is far too loud and distracting, the narrator speaks so quickly it's impossible for an adult to comprehend everything that is being said, much less a 7th grade student.  Also, there are no menus available (at least that I could find) that would make it easy to use in a classroom setting.",1393459200,4,438,4.589743589743589
