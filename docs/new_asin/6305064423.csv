7881803,1,6305064423,"One of the worst films of this type I have ever seen.  Definitely a cut and paste of cutting room floor junk, stitched together and falsely advertized to appeal to those of us who enjoy this category of film.  Promises, but delivers .... nothing.  It should be illegal to sell such a worthless product.  And the tape quality itself was trash.  The only good scene in the whole film featured Felica, and for her scene the tape was defective for the last half of the scene and it presented like a scrambled cable channel!!  What a waste of time and money.  Save yours and don't buy this ripoff.",1141171200,5,592,4.425925925925926
