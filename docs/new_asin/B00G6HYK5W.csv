6061655,5,B00G6HYK5W,"This is a great DVD for kids! I loved the way the host Funmi presents. To me, this is the best way kids can learn about nutrition in a fun way. The puppetry is superb and the kids really relate to it.  Just looking at how engaged they were and how many laughs I saw was more than enough to know that I made the right decision to purchase the DVD. I used the fun recipes to make healthy nutritious food for my kids so I the adult, learned a lot too! Great purchase, highly recommended.",1382918400,,484,4.041666666666667
6061656,5,B00G6HYK5W,"As a teacher we are always looking for something to do for holiday down time and spring break, this is the perfect video. It's fun, educational and has good snack recipes, we had so much fun, there's a cute little Beyonc dance skit. I couldn't believe the asking price. I'm getting a bunch for friends for Christmas.",1382832000,,316,4.56140350877193
6061657,5,B00G6HYK5W,"This DVD was great for my nephew, whom we're trying to start on a healthy lifestyle early. He really enjoyed the DVD and watched the whole thing. Although it's geared toward children, I watched it with him and surprisingly learned some new things. Great buy!",1382745600,,258,4.7555555555555555
8621047,5,B00G6HYK5W,"Everything people are saying about this DVD is true. It's so much fun, and my daughter loves it.  She was 6 months old when I was gifted this, and she is a year and a half now and she still loves it! It's entertaining for me, too.  Lets, face it, sometimes kid movies are stupid.  Like, Baby Gourmet, that was a waste of time and money ill never get back! This is not the case with Funmi and friends.  Plus, that Funmi is SO pretty, i might watch it just for her! LOL! I can't wait to see what they come out with next.",1420761600,,518,3.951923076923077
8621048,5,B00G6HYK5W,"I am a youth after care teacher and bought the DVD to show to my students and they LOVED it. The younger kids dance around a lot (especially to the Beyonce episode lol) and the older kids were just as engaged. I really love how this DVD focuses on health and nutrition by promoting urban farms, giving how-to (kid accessible) instructions on making really cool snacks, and by making exercise fun. Awesome product.",1390694400,,413,4.671232876712328
8621049,5,B00G6HYK5W,"This is an awesome tool to get kids thinking about healthier eating habits. I love the puppets and the host's interaction with them. The language is very clear and not overly complicated so kids can easily understand the concepts being presented. I love that it not only shows how to make healthy snacks, but also how to start your own garden - even if you don't have a huge space.
I also think it's wonderful that there's an international aspect to it. I love exposing kids to other cultures; especially where food is concerned.
Overall, it was a fun watch and the kids really liked it!",1384300800,,587,4.547169811320755

8621051,5,B00G6HYK5W,"This DVD is exciting,fun, and educational.  It is great for all ages.  My 2 year old grandson ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! We both learned a lot about urban farms, gardening, healthy eating, and exercise. There is even an international segment!  I am encouraged to begin my garden again.  This inspiring DVD will definitely be on my gift giving list this year.",1384041600,,352,4.816666666666666
8621052,5,B00G6HYK5W,"I am so glad I purchased this DVD! I work at a day care and we are planning more fruit and vegetable based snacks/meals so the DVD is perfect for us. The kids and instructors watched the pita sandwich video and our kiddos get out their little chef hats and we have our own cooking show (snack making session) as we follow along to Funmi and Friends.

One of our favorite videos is the urban farm episode. The kids learned that urban farms are in cities! They did not know that before. So we are planning our own little field trip to an urban farm! Get this DVD for fun learning :)",1383696000,,580,4.178571428571429
8621053,5,B00G6HYK5W,"I haven't seen this disc, but I've seen the videos. I helped produce some of them! Working with Funmi on these kids' outreach packages was really fun. Funmi is a very good communicator and has mad skills in front of the camera. If I were a kid, I would be a fan!",1383436800,,262,4.0576923076923075
8621054,5,B00G6HYK5W,Video is a combination of educational and humorous. Perfect for kids to learn about healthy eating with fun characters! Funmi understands how connect with children and make them understand important concepts so they can implement it themselves. I'm a big fan of puppets and any parent would get their money's worth from buying this video!,1383177600,,338,5.163636363636364
8621055,5,B00G6HYK5W,"I am an elementary school instructor and I watched the DVD with the 4th grade students and they loved it! We watched the entire dvd, and learned about urban farms, etc... They students didn't want to stop watching Funmi and friends!!!! One of our class projects involved making healthy snacks from the DVD and they thought it was sooo yummy, not to mention healthy!",1383004800,,365,4.71875
8621056,5,B00G6HYK5W,"Funmi and Friends was a great addition to my household for my 6 and 2 yr olds. They both love this DVD and ask to watch it almost everyday. When my 6yr old daughter gets home from school she begs to watch the DVD so it's a reward after she finishes her homework. As a family, we enjoy trying out the different recipes together and I'm thankful that this show encourages healthy and fun eating. I recommended this DVD to my 2 yr old's daycare and the kids there love it as well. Thank you Funmi and Friends! I'm excited that I found an educational program that keeps my kid's attention, is interesting for my entire family, and has helped my children make good eating choices on their own.",1382918400,,688,4.341085271317829
