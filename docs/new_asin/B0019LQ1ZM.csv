8718282,1,B0019LQ1ZM,I mean i didn't expect citizen kane but this was one of the worst films i've seen in a while. all the humor falls flat. there's no redeeming qualities. go ahead and skip it i promise you'll find something else to watch,1535068800,,218,4.214285714285714

The sound track is the background music you hear when you go shopping. The script could have been written better by first-graders...

This movie is so low in quality that it should not even be on Amazon - even for free! Definitely, not even worth 0.99$, not to mention 1.99$

Do NOT waste your money on this!!! This movie is a rip-off!!!!",1296172800,,434,4.4
8718284,5,B0019LQ1ZM,"I am so happy this movie is finally being released on DVD!  It may seem like just another geek-angst-sex comedy but the acting is truly remarkable.  Cullen Cowan as the handsome roommate was a real standout, I hope he's in more films.  Overall, a very funny movie with an unusual twist at the end.",1213056000,2,297,4.462962962962963
