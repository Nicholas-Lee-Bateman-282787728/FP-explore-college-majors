8004773,5,B0000YWKEU,I love this movie especially that I lived in Italy and i found it a true classic movie that pictures the true life of certain areas of Italy in the 1980's or so. If you understand the Italian culture and language this is a 5 star movie to keep in your library. It is funny and emotional. I LOVE it.,1487980800,,298,3.9833333333333334

8004779,5,B0000YWKEU,"I watched this movie long time ago.  Glad I watched it again. It reminds me of a bygone era where kids like myself had to work, and study, and be mature to help the family survive from day to day.  I may sound like a grumpy old man but when I see kids acting as babies, teenagers as rotten children, and adults as teenagers, makes me wonder if we may progress or we regressed.  And no, nothing was perfect and life was tough; but still, we were happy most of the time despite the relative poverty in material goods and the many hardships.",1369094400,2,538,4.203883495145631
8004780,5,B0000YWKEU,"Ordering was simple, delivery was 'error-free' and relatively quick for a fair price (other sites were too expensive).  I saw this movie in the theatre about 17 years ago on my first date w/now husband and purchased for our anniversary to watch with our kids.  Everyone loved it.  The children in the movie have angelic faces and the most foul mouths, which is simply hysterical ... very heartwarming.",1352851200,2,401,4.867647058823529
