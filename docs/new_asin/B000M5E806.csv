8166481,4,B000M5E806,"So a very good pick for a B Movie Night event, again, the 70's brings us great fun with this classic bit of tomfoolery! The description of the plot of the movie you will soon learn does not align! And the graphics, well one must give tribute where tribute is due, thanks Gold Medal Flour for providing the make up for Mr. Hyde! This movie will not disappoint you with corny music, corny dialog, and racially, sexually charged offensiveness! Warning, there is nudity in one scene during the Dr. Exam, so you may wanna cover the kiddo's eyes if they are near by!

The two cops in the movie, well they are the stars of the show in my opinion! Never a goofball team have I seen! One cop only knows the word F***  and the other guy's one liner metamorphic anecdotes are sure to leave you completely perplexed and laughing with a case of the ""What did he say?"" !",1472947200,,856,4.3105590062111805
8166482,4,B000M5E806,Saw this movie when I was a little girl. It was just what I expected. Bad acting and with the obvious fake blood. But I loved it,1436054400,,128,3.7777777777777777

8166484,5,B000M5E806,"This film came out at the height of the Black action film era.  This one, the two Blacula films and Blackstein are the only sci-fi , horror films of that era except for a few others.  This is one that any collector of Black action films should have.",1390176000,,249,4.166666666666667
8166485,4,B000M5E806,The ending sucks... lol.. well it's really when they killed the beast... he just did poor acting while dying and i was mad.. lol.. besides that... the movie had me dying laughing. i enjoyed it...,1316217600,,195,4.6
8166486,4,B000M5E806,"I saw this as a teen in the 80s (w/Elvira) and during the 3pm movie (10 yrs before Oprah LOL) that came on during the week as a kid. I think my grandmother tried to cover my eyes then.

Not bad.  I wish we could have these kind of movies now without people getting PC.

Once I get Gargoyles and The Thing w/Two Heads (Rosey Grier), I can see what cult flicks I've been missing out on all these yrs.",1303948800,,398,3.95

8166489,3,B000M5E806,"This is a funny/horror type blaxploitation spinoff of the Dr. Jekyll and Hyde. Casey protrays a respectable Black doctor trying to help his sickest patients only to come up with a disaster chemical formula that turns him into a ""haint"" wandering aimlessly scaring innocent potential victims. Check out that scene where the nurse, in doing her normal duties in a patients' room, (the hospital is mysteriously quiet and empty), turns around and finds that a once bedridden elderly black woman has sat up in bed white as a ghost, hair white as snow,  mouth opened wide making scary sounds. The nurse almost wet her skirt. Just imagine what it would be like to be alone in a morgue and have a ghost like corpse sit up with pop eyes making gargling noises. Well that's what it was like.",1217116800,,781,4.659420289855072
