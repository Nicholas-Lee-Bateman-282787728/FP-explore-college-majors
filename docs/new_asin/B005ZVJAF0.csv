8489991,5,B005ZVJAF0,"Absolutely love this anime, however the $1k price tag is far too much especially since it was announce that a re-release will be taking place in July 2012. The re-release may not have the extras this one edition has, however at 1/20th the price, it won't be beat.",1339459200,4,263,4.5
8489992,5,B005ZVJAF0,"Okay I was fortunate to pre-order the $80.00 blu-ray of this series, Woo-diddly-who, but the prices is too outragous, currently $500.00 to $+1000.00. I hope it's for well fare charity. Anyway right now you can pre-oorder the dvd version for $45.00 here [...] my opinion go ahead and buy something $+5.00 to get the free shipping. Limited edition or not, I don't know nor care because this sort of series should be praised among many who enjoy anime/otaku (lol).

I would re-link to another amazon page but for some reason ANIPLEX OF AMERICA shows no love (fate zero, wtf)and no dub for some I'm-not-going-to-argue-with-others-reason.

Anyway sorry that this was not about the show, but for these prices how many have seen or owned it legally.",1338768000,,742,4.928
8489993,5,B005ZVJAF0,"Pros:
a great show

Cons:
astronomical price

Other Thoughts:
the show itself is a modern classic.
the story itself is simple a guy comes home one day and finds an anime dvd case with a lil' sister eroge(adult sim game) inside, he soon discovers that it belongs to his little sister who it turns out is a closet otaku.
she turns to her brother for life lessons, help to keep her secret, and help making friends who share her hobby.
what follows is a very funny and heartwarming anime series that is a must watch for anime fans worldwide.
however the company that released this set are without a doubt ripping people off.
what you get is
a thin card slipcase
a 3 dvd single case with double sided cover.
a booklet with character info and images and some small artwork images.
a 16 piece postcard set.
a double sided poster.
and a bushiness card sized proof of purchase card.
i have bought blu-ray/dvd combo special edition sets cheaper than this.
it is a great set and for any fan of the show it is worth having,
but it is in absolutely no way worth the price.
25-35 definitely 40 is just worth it, but not 58.
if it was a blu-ray/dvd combo set with the additional material the yes but not a 3 dvd set.
the company is cashing in on the fact that it has the rights to a much loved and very popular anime
and so can charge whatever they want and get it.
Would you recommend this title: Yes",1333584000,,1386,4.266159695817491
8489994,5,B005ZVJAF0,"This is my first review on Amazon, so I will try to make it as informative as possible.

First, concerning the the price here on Amazon. While the price is obviously inflated as of this review (~$300) due to it being only available through rightstuf in early October for about $60, it is now out of print.

The LE box that contains the following:
A 3-DVD set in one DVD case with a reversible DVD jacket
A 24-page Color Booklet with various character illustrations, bios, art galleries and the Japanese DVD/BD Cover art.
A Double Sided Poster, one with Kirino and Kuroneko in kimono and shinto priestess dress; respectively. The other side features Kirino and Kyousuke, her brother, on a shopping trip.
A Pack of Postcards with the ending art for all 16 episodes
Card of Proof of purchase

I had watched some of the show as fansubs and streaming on ANN and had interest in it, so I was rather excited to see it was being brought over domestically. This was a rather unique release, as Aniplex did not license it to a company here in the US, but handled by Aniplex directly with rightstuf exclusively handling the orders. This meant a rather small distribution, which obviously resulted in it becoming out of print quickly.

This exclusive release has quality packaging and I felt the extras were nice, and the price was pretty good, considering the Japanese version would easily go for over $300 and spread across 8 discs. However, the Japanese sets had audio CDs of the ending themes as extras too.

The DVDs include the opening and all 16 endings without any credits, which is nice for collectors and AMV creators such as myself, so I appreciate the fact they included these on here. Most other distributors would not had included them.

I was rather surprised that this series was not released on Blu-ray (BD), but DVD only so far. I do believe Aniplex is planning on a BD release later in 2012, and I hope the reason they included a Proof of Purchase card in this set is to either provide a free or discounted BD version when it is released.

As for the show itself, I love the complex characters and their development throughout the story, as well as the relationships between them. The hook, I felt, is that the main female character, Kirino, is a closet otaku with interests in anime and eroge (erotic games), and shows a realistic world where such hobbies are frowned upon. Once her brother finds out about her hobby, an interesting interaction and relationship develops between them, as she asks him to help hide her hobby from her parents. Soon, the cast grows to include a rather sophisticated girl with particular tastes in anime, as well as an older girl otaku with an interesting way of speaking.

The storyline and voice acting are engaging, making it an enjoyable watch, with various dips into comedic and dramatic moments. Through the story, the interrelationships between characters become more than more complex, especially once the anime expands into a different route after the ""good"" ending. It builds upon the fact that the anime focuses around the type of games that have various paths and endings. So, the anime which would be normally 12 episodes long expands into 16 total. For a complete package, the music adds to the show too. I am a fan of the opening theme especially, sung by ClariS. The translations and subtitles are on par with this sort of release and are pretty accurate, and I believe they matched the webcasts from Anime News Network.

As an anime fan watching anime since the early 90s, I do highly recommend this show on all its content. It will keep most fans interested with its character designs, voice acting, story plot and twists. It also gives an insider peek into the otaku world in Japan from the perspective of a non-fan and is pretty informative overall for people new to otaku-dom, not just the fandom but the pitfalls of being a fan in Japanese society.",1327190400,10,3908,4.693430656934306
8489995,5,B005ZVJAF0,"This anime is amazing. It's funny, and has a good cast of characters that you instantly love. The product itself is great to. It has a two-sided poster, 16 post cards, and a character book with tons of pictures and character outlines along with three discs that have the 12 episodes from the first season, and the three OVAs. I recommend this for any anime lover.",1325203200,3,363,4.515151515151516
8489996,2,B005ZVJAF0,"Really? I would have bought this before when it was worth $50. You would have to be insane to purchase this for 188$
I love this anime, however it's not worth the price, even if its limited edition. I suggest you buy this elsewhere, or wait for the price to go down.

Revised-Aniplex is planning to rerelease this anime soon in the future so please be patient and wait.",1324080000,8,369,4.3478260869565215
