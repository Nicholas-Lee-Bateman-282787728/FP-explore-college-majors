199059,5,1586683950,"There have been many complaints about the Kermit scenes being cut from this edition of the video. The company releasing this video tried to get the rights to put this in but because Disney bought the rights to the Muppets it was not allowed (...)

If nothing else, the Kermit scenes being taken out is minor. The story and characters still remain without the narration, and this is in fact the most complete release that has been (and probably ever will be) seen of this movie yet!! If you like this movie, buy this edition. If you love the muppets, buy this movie. If you love Christmas stories or just good entertaining movies with puppetry, buy this movie!!",1128470400,,660,4.593220338983051
199060,1,1586683950,"The original ""Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas"" was opened and closed by the narration and appearance of Kermit the Frog.

This dvd has removed him, and the blame is put on rights issues.  It's really an issue of a cheap company that wants money and has no taste for art.  Release the real thing, or don't release it at all.  5 stars for the original, wonderful short film created by Jim Henson; 1 star for this hack of a version.",1123372800,22,429,4.3924050632911396

It will also have a ""New Lost Song"".  But THIS TIME they are going to be cutting out the Kermit the Frog scenes!!!  I think I will keep my current 'butchered' copy, instead of getting a second 'butchered' copy.

Paid extra for the HD version and its not the original 4:3 aspect ratio.  They zoomed it in and cropped off the top and bottom so that it would fit 16:9 and its awful.  So disappointing!  Why do they do this?  If someone really hates black bars then they can use the zoom function on their TV, but as it is everyone looses out.

Jerry Juhl wrote the script for the special, adapting the story from a book by Russell Hoban; original songs for the special were written by Paul Williams; Jim Henson directed. The Henson special was adapted into a live musical stage show by the Jim Henson Company, premiering at the Goodspeed Opera House in December 2008.  Online Muppet Wiki

To this Child of the Sixties the Muppets can do no wrong, and this heartwarming holiday story is a family favorite. One notable detail not highlighted in this Amazon listing are the SPECIAL FEATURES contained on this singledisc 40th Anniversary disc. Aside from the wonderfully expansive Behind the Scenes installment, these extras may explain why you might remember this TV special differently. Over the years, as Jim Hensons production moved between networks, it was often edited to satisfy different time requirements. One example; some airings (after the 2004 Walt Disney acquisition) did not contain the Kermit the Frog intro _ this latest 2017 release does.

02. Deleted / Alternate Scenes
03. Lost Song Born in a Trunk
04. Outtakes

199131,2,1586683950,"Great movie.  The quality of the DVD is of a VHF recording. Very poor. I was exspecting a better quality with it being a 40th anniversary edition. Do NOT watch on anything larger than a 36"".",1512950400,2,190,4.277777777777778
199132,4,1586683950,"This is the best DVD version yet of this beloved Christmas classic.  I own the other two DVD releases but couldn't thoroughly enjoy them because of glaring omissions (Kermit's end narration was taken out of the first DVD release and Kermit was omitted entirely from the second.  Totally unforgiveable!). This new version restores Kermit's beginning and end narrations and also restores the complete scene where Ma Otter tells Mrs. Fox to ""fall off the dock"",  a line that was cut out of the previous DVD versions  (Deemed too violent perhaps?).  Yes the matted widescreen is annoying with it's heavily cropped borders, but this is a compromise I can live with.  And it's also true that the picture quality leaves something to be desired, but it's still much better than you're going to get with the old VHS version.",1512950400,2,815,4.869565217391305
199133,5,1586683950,"I had grown up with Jim Henson productions.  From ""The Great Muppet Caper"", to ""Muppet Treasure Island"", ""Sesame Street"", to the quintessential ""Muppet Babies"".  However, through the years, I had come to forget the time I spent in Jim Henson's world an imagination...until I found a copy of this in my local walmart.  I had never seen this film, but it really brought everything back and showed me how much i missed the imagination of Jim Henson.  This film (and his other works) definitely showcase a kind of optimism and kindness that is lacking in much of television, today...and especially substance and lack of dumbing down that can both be appreciated from both child and adult.  And as an icing on cake, this film (and Jim Henson's work) act as a fine example of ""they don't make 'em like they used to"".  Henson was a puppetry pioneer pushing the envelope on what puppets could do...pushing them into surprising leading roles rather than amusing accents and support.  Not many do this anymore...and with this quality and grandeur.

And yes, Kermit the Frog does make a guest appearance in this.  The synopsis states that Kermit ""narrates"".  That's actually a misnomer.  Kermit introduces and closes the film.  He doesn't play a central part of this tale.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Well, this is a Jim Henson production and frankly, there's nothing of particular consequence to note.

About the Film (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas is a film based on the book by the same name.  It tells a simple story about a Mother and Son who separately have to make challenging and life changing decisions for this Christmas season.  Without going into details, the film basically catalogues the events (both external and internal) that lead up to the decisions being made...and the results.  It's not that complicated of a tale, but it's no less deep.

There are several things I loved about the film.  The first was how central of a role the father was...but in not a way you'd normally expect.  I'm was also pleasantly surprised at how complexed the characters could be, and the hardships of life and sense of grace the characters displayed living in it.  I also really loved the ending. I won't say more on it except that it's a very real way to end it.  The voice acting, cinematography, set designs and choreography are amazing...I'm still amazed what Jim Henson and Co. are able to accomplish.

Video quality is the only thing ""suffering"".  Well, not really and isn't a huge deal to be honest.  Anyone with an HD player will of course experience improved visual playback.  However, it definitely is dated and the visual quality is something akin to a higher definition (if played from an HD player) of an early 90s production.  Doesn't hurt it any...but for kids who have grown up with only HD...it'll be a new world for them.

All in all:
This film caused me to shed some tear.  Part of it was nostalgia and finding ""an old friend once forgotten"".  Another part was the magic and beauty of the craft.  But, the main part was because of the story told about a family trying to make it through life.",1512691200,,3117,4.748603351955308

As a self proclaimed Muppetologist, this is the best version of the film ever released. How the Henson company got rights to use Kermit in the film is beyond me but they did it. This is the original HBO version that Muppet fans have been waiting for for years.

This includes:
-Kermit in the opening and ending scenes
-The cut dialogue
-Cut song lyrics
-Complete HBO version

What I am not sure about is the fact that is is wide screen. I am not sure if they cropped the picture but it looks pretty good. For the Muppet completest (like me) you should get all the version but this is the best version so far.",1510531200,6,697,4.346153846153846
199142,1,1586683950,"This is the Phone-It-In-For-A-Quick-Buck 40th Edition, continuing a long line of crappy releases for this fantastic film. They set the aspect ratio to fill a widescreen TV and consequently cut the tops and bottoms of the scenes. Also, they did nothing to improve the image quality, so the closer focus of the aspect ratio makes it look fuzzier and more out of focus. The colors are also washed out. All of this is made glaringly obvious by the special features done in the original TV aspect ratio. And as if to twist the knife, the special features are from an older release, so the cut and additional scenes you can watch are actually in the version you watch on the DVD. Im a huge fan of Emmet Otters Jugband Christmas, and I was really hoping this full-version, 40th-anniversary edition would be the definitive release. Alas, it is yet another bad version of this classic holiday movie.",1509753600,6,890,4.711538461538462

199144,2,1586683950,"Please note, this is not a review of the special but rather the 40th anniversary DVD. The good news is that the Kermit and the laundry scenes have been restored. The bad news, the special is matted to widescreen and features a manipulated film-like framerate (this was confirmed by Amazon user The Movie Man) . This is the transfer the Jim Henson Company made a short while ago and I hate to say it, I'm disappointed. The Jim Henson Company has also done this to Fraggle Rock (matted widescreen but framerate, 60fps, is correct) and they should know they don't have to matte something to widescreen (especially if that production was full screen to begin with) and manipulate a 60fps framerate to 24fps. I appreciate the fact they were able to restore the Kermit and laundry scenes (the former we should also thank Disney for giving them permission), but the presentation should NOT, nor should it ever be interfered.

Which is why I suggest to you to boycott this release and ask The Jim Henson Company/Sony to do a replacement program featuring the special in original full screen and with the original 60fps video framerate.",1507939200,9,1127,4.779487179487179
199145,4,1586683950,"Emmet Otters Jug-Band Christmas,"" based on the 1971 childrens book by Russell and Lillian Hoban, was adapted into a one-hour holiday TV special in December, 1977 by Jim Henson and company. The special features a special appearance by Kermit the Frog as the narrator. In later airings, Kermits narration was edited out, but this fully remastered version includes the restored scenes with Hensons iconic character.

As Christmas approaches Frogtown Hollow, Emmet Otter and his Ma can only dream of buying each other gifts with the little money they make from Ma doing laundry and Emmet doing odd jobs. So, when a Christmas Eve talent contest is announced, Emmet joins a jug band and Ma decides to sing a song. But Emmet will have to put a hole in Mas washtub to make a bass. And Ma will have to hock Emmets tool chest to buy herself a costume.

Reminiscent of O Henrys The Gift of the Magi, the project involved building the largest stage ever for a Muppet production and, for the first time, some of the Muppets were powered by remote control.

The program features seven original songs by Paul Williams that include novelty tunes (The Bathing Suit Your Grandma Otter Wore), upbeat numbers (Bar-B-Que), and lilting ballads (When the River Meets the Sea). The songs have a folksy bluegrass quality and are a perfect fit for the story. Interestingly, for a Christmas special, there are no Christmas-themed songs.

Bonus materials on the unrated DVD release include deleted alternate scenes; outtakes; the lost song Born in a Trunk; and the featurette Behind the Scenes in Frogtown Hollow.",1507766400,,1585,4.902985074626866
199146,5,1586683950,"This review is only for the 40th anniversary edition. Sony has done the impossible!  Not only do they bring back Kermit the Frog from the original 1977 HBO version, but they have also included the original version of the laundry scene between Ma Otter and Gretchen Fox we all remember (shame that TriStar thought we couldn't handle such a politically incorrect thought coming from a muppet!)  The sound quality and picture quality are also excellent as well.

In my opinion, this is Jim Henson at his best.  Great story line and catchy music composed by none other than Paul Williams who wrote the classic ""Rainbow Connection"" for The Muppet Movie. These days, when a majority of what kids watch can be filled with violence and/or adult content and innuendos that don't belong in kids programming, you can be sure that you will find none of that here. This is a wholesome family show.

We take what we want

We do anything that we wish

We got no respect

For animal birdy or fish

The grass does not grow

On the places where we stop and stand

River Bottom Nightmare Band

We know were a mess

But I does not like to be clean

We don't brush our teeth

Cause our toothache can help us stay mean

We don't wish to learn

But we hate what we don't understand

River Bottom

When you see us comin

You better startin runnin

Were always startin trouble

And were happiest when things are outta hand

Rivers are for boilin

Parties are for spoilin

We either like to sit and pout

Or else go out and terrorize our land

River Bottom Nightmare Band

We laugh in your face

Or we practice our growl and our sneer

We break up your place

We are dangerous when we are near

And when we are done with our song

Who will get the biggest hand?

Who?

River Bottom Nightmare Band!

199270,5,1586683950,"This 49-minute version of EMMETT OTTER'S JUGBAND CHRISTMAS is shorter than the network version introduced by Kermit the Frog, but it holds together well nonetheless.  Jim Henson and his Muppets crew did themselves proud in this 1977 TV movie based on the 1971 children's book of the same name, and incorporates use of marionettes (top-string puppets, unusual for the Muppeteers)  some radio control (a new technology at the time), and traditional hand-controlled Muppets.  The elaborate sets convey well the atmosphere of water, mountains and small towns so crucial to this story.  The story of impoverished widow Ma Otter and her young son Emmett, who hope so badly to win a Christmastime talent contents and buy nice presents, works best at Christmas but is suitable anytime.  Paul Williams' music conveys well the flavor of Central Appalachian bluegrass whether in poignant ballads or jug-band mayhem.  Although the sets, characters and songs say ""Hill Folk,"" the production was actually filmed in Toronto.  Along with the usual Muppetts crew, a special vocal talent is singer Marilyn Sokol as Ma Otter.  This disc includes welcome making-of interviews from 2005.  The price makes this treat an offer you can't refuse, and a welcome stocking-stuffer come Christmas.",1463961600,,1268,5.3

Again its not a download issue.  Its not a big deal, i have the original on an old dvd, but Amazon needs to at least get a copy that doesn't have this problem. If you can find an old DVD snatch it up. Its the full deal with kermit on the bike !",1451174400,,428,3.9767441860465116

An adaptation created by Jim Henson where the sets were actually three dimensional for the puppets(Muppets), which allowed the camera to zoom in on the characters from any angle. The movie was a true masterpiece for it's time and still doesn't fail to charm the audience of today as many people can relate to the topics involved in the film(especially in a recession) and brings a re- newed and true meaning of the Christmas holiday.

With catchy jingles that linger in my mind thirty years later with original characters and storyline, my bet is that families for the next thirty more years will get enjoyment of this classic.",1440115200,2,768,4.8106060606060606

199492,5,1586683950,"When he was just a small child, my son & I discovered this cute Christmas story about young Emmett Otter & his mother who live in poverty & are facing Christmas empty-handed. When a talent show offers a chance at winning enough money to buy the other a gift, unbeknownst to one another, Emmett & his mother both sign up for the contest. But as life often goes, they have to make a big sacrifice to enter the contest: Mama sells Emmett's fathers tools & Emmett pokes a hole in Mama's washtub to make a washtub stringed instrument. But will it work for either? The absolute syrupy sweetness of this little show is part of the draw for us, & frankly, the music isn't bad. The sheer joy they share facing each day & the values exhibited are exactly the attributes I tried to share with my son. He's a grown man now with family of his own, but even if we aren't together at the time, we both still watch Emmett Otter's Jugband Christmas some time during the Christmas season. It may be a bit predictable, & sometimes, you can see the strings that move the puppets about, but it's not about technology or slick production; it's about love.",1423180800,,1133,4.4

199538,5,1586683950,"I REFUSE to rate this poorly simply because it does not have the Kermit intro and segues. Oh wah! Boohoo! BIG DEAL! I watched this as a child too. It was one of my favorite Christmas classics as a kid and it will ALWAYS be! This is the ORIGINAL release which did not contain Kermit. He was added in later on for an ABC network special. I got over it real quick. There are a couple scenes I noticed weren't there that I did miss, but that still wasn't bad enough for me to rate this poorly because the truth of the matter is Jim Henson was a visionary and this was a feat of artistic talent and movie production, especially for the times!
I was thrilled to find it at such an affordable price as well because I bought a copy for me and a copy to send to my one year old niece as well to help my sister pass on one of our favorite childhood traditions to her own child! They live half a continent away, but thanks to today's technology I was able to see her entranced by the characters and dancing and bopping along to the music!",1420502400,2,1027,4.089108910891089

All because a snake oil salesmen would have done it. I think you had to have watched this a lot as a kid to say this movie is great.
It is confusing for kids when they see the primitive Kermit prototype. He is a scaly bad guy that still looks like Kermit.

199738,3,1586683950,"There's some controversy regarding the omission of Kermit the Frog in the modern DVD release of this beloved show.  I've read many reviews with harsh things to say about Disney because of it. To clarify, Disney does not own the rights to Emmet Otter and has nothing to do with any DVD release of this show. The Jim Henson Company sold the rights to The Muppets to Disney but retained the rights to their other properties including Emmet Otter.  Because of this, a modern dvd release of this show is nearly impossible with out the removal of Kermit the frog.

Fron Wikipedia:
""The original special was hosted by Kermit the Frog. However, later releases edited out the frog's narration due to legal issues. While The Jim Henson Company retained ownership of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, the company sold the rights to the Muppets (including Kermit) to The Walt Disney Company in 2004 (namely their branch in The Muppets Studio).""",1416873600,,932,4.849056603773585

So i never got to see the ending.
Which really sucked and it bothered me for years.
Then years later i purchased it from a store on dvd and brought it home and popped it in my dvd player and was surprised that they cut the opening scene where kermit the frog is riding his bike and crashes into the town sign and runs into the river bottom gang and the he does some narating and the opening credits start.
That scene was missing and it really upset me.
On this tape i was pleased that it was not cut out and it made me happier.
There are differnet versions of this special i believe as well out there.
There is supposed to be a scene at the end where Kermit is in the town tavern narating a little bit more before the end credits start.
It is not featured in the end of this tape unfortunatley but atleast they left the classic opening scene with him in it riding his bike and crashing into the town sign and hurting his foot.
In closing i would buy this version on tape and not on dvd becasue if you grew up watching the special on tv, you will be dissapointed that some of the scenes were cut out in the dvd release.",1413158400,3,1242,4.069387755102041

Five stars for what it is, two stars for the chopped up version here.

The GOOD news is that there was an earlier dvd release that did indeed have Kermit. We have both at our house, since the more current dvd release was missing Kermit but has some nice  behind the scenes stuff, at least. So there IS a 2001 dvd release that has Kermit parts still there.

This is one of the best things the Muppets crew ever did, even in its simplicity. And you have to have Kermit!
Here's hoping someday Disney sees the value of this longtime classic and works with the Henson folks to produce a blu ray of the original content.",1387584000,,784,4.5

199905,4,1586683950,"One of my all time favorite Christmas stories for kids during the holiday times. However,the ""missing footage"" should be restored so that it is as it was originally shown on TV. For example,ALL of the ""intros"" done by Kermit The Frog have been removed, as well as, a bit of the confrontational dialogue between Mrs Otter and Gretchen Fox on the dock.  Come on folks,give us the ""real thing""...there have been enough of the ""edited versions"" of this classic released....now it's time now for a release of the complete ""original version"" without edits to be enjoyed as it was intended.",1387497600,,583,4.83

It quickly became a viewing tradition during the Christmas season and even to this day my family still makes references to it in conversation.  So now that I have children I decided to pass the tradition along.

The version appearing on Amazon Prime was edited from the original broadcast version.  It eliminated all the side scenes with Kermit the Frog and a few throw away lines here and there.  So if you're watching it and seem to remember things slightly different, don't worry your memory is not slipping.

My sister actually purchased the DVD version a few years back and I asked her if it too was edited and she said no, that it was the original broadcast version.  So if you're looking for the ""original childhood memory"" check out the DVD version.",1387497600,,837,4.614864864864865

  But down to the entertainment factor. Younger kids will like it as it Jim Henson and Company Muppets, so it is not fancy, life like CGI that teen's seem to enjoy these days (though they should). Yes you can see the wires, no the mouth doesn't move to the words. Parents should get a good chuckle out of it if anything but a reminder of The Muppet Show and what a great mind Henson had and you may get a surprising tear or two for the ending.
 The world of Frogtown Hollow is 3D with attention to detail which again in the world of CGI we now live is something to see and marvel at. This is a ""musical"" and has some very catchy songs that all can enjoy,",1386028800,,912,4.2

199959,1,1586683950,"I think before selling a product to a consumer, the seller should be obligated to tell them what they are getting.
After buying Emmet Otter on DVD only to find it had whole scenes removed, I have foolishly purchased the collectors
version of Emmet Otter thinking this would be the full version.
What I got were a few of the cut scenes in the ""SPECIAL FEATURES"" Other than that, it was the same butchered copy.
It was nice that these scenes were acknowledged but not effective for the viewing the story.
Now, if the producers are serious about the almighty dollar, they would restore the great Christmas story
And people like me would probably jump at the opportunity to own it.
They did the same thing with Muppet's Christmas Carol. Scenes were deleted from the wide screen blue ray

The original HBO showings in 1978 and 1979 did not have Kermit in them. In 1980 ABC edited the film and they added Kermit's narrative to the original. If you want the Kermit version you need to find the DVD or VHS that was made from the ABC 1980 edition, not the original HBO version of 1978 and 1979.

Their commentary about the 'fish not having any money this year' really is a big part of the setting of the story. I feel the impact of their dire situation is lost without it. Then, the interaction between 'Ma' and 'Mrs. Fox' is not the same as the 80's version. In fact, the line Mr. Opossum has after Mrs. Fox exits doesn't make any sense since they didn't adjust his line for the edit. The 80's version of that scene IS found in the Special Features of the DVD. I think I may edit the scenes back in for my own use.

200170,5,1586683950,"My children and I loved this movie when we saw it on tv when they were little tikes. I love the work of Jim Henson and his staff. Though copyrighted in 1977, their production is a classic now and are family-oriented, which is getting harder and harder to find.
As for the movie, the plot is based around a Christmas in Frogtown Hollow with the main characters being Emmet and Ma Otter. Their Christmas gifts are always very plain if not redundant (like, a shirt that had been dyed). They are dirt-poor and have no money for store-bought gifts. Ma Otter does wash, sewing and the like to help the two live day by day and Emmet takes odd jobs to help. Without giving away the movie too much, there is a local talent show coming and there is a $50 cash prize for the winner. Ma Otter sings ""beautifully"" (actually the singer is very good) and Emmet and 3 friends have put together a jub band. Emmet and Ma want to win to buy the other a store-bought Christmas present.
The action, characters and situations are very funny for the children and some of us ""young at heart"" adults. I love all of the late Jim Henson's work. The genius of the work he and his staff have to do to get a ""take"" on each scene is sometimes high, i.e., the rolling drum scene. I recommend this movie to kids of all ages. It teaches good morals, hard work and perseverence along with ""good things come to those who wait"". Needless to say, they don't win the contest, but they do win in another way. You and your babies will enjoy it. They have scenes deleted, bloopers (believe it or not) and good interviews with the ones who produced and played parts in it was, for me, very eye-opening into the hows, whys and wherefores of puppetry. Great songs, writing and all around great work.",1264809600,,1754,4.36697247706422

My only real complaint is in one of the bonus features. The voice of Grover temporarily is being Ma Otter and he's joking about this one scene having to be done over and over again. After a while he says, ""Good Lord"" a couple of times and ""Sweet Jesus"" once which was offensive to me but especially offensive because my kids were watching. I don't think it was a good decision to allow those comments on the outtakes.

Otherwise, the rest of the extra features were really fun and interesting. Wish they still made great kid shows like this one.",1260921600,,744,4.463235294117647

Truthfully I didn't remember the whole Kermit debate but I was curious so I read that it has to do with Disney earning the rights to Kermit and the Muppets. No matter, as the movie for me was about Emmet and his jug band overcoming adversity and sticking together as a team. I lost my VHS copy sometime ago when I was a kid and I haven't seen it in years. Now if you are a 1080p snob like me sometimes you wonder how we used to watch movies without ultra realistic crisp special effects, it's none of that but it beats an old VHS version of a taped broadcast. The resolution might not be spectacular, you might see some strings when Ma' slides down the hill, but you will appreciate the craft that Mr Henson brought to the world. This is a heart warming tale based on the Maji that might make you remember simpler times, as well as what Christmas is all about.",1260748800,,912,4.1875

200191,5,1586683950,"This movie beats most Christmas shows HANDS DOWN. First shown on TV back in the late seventies/early eighties, it was a staple of Christmas programming for years. The characters are all Muppets (not, though, the usual Muppet Show crew - these are all original creations) but the story is bittersweet. That makes a lot of sense when you realize it was written by the great Russell Hoban (Bedtime for Frances and all its sequels/ The Mouse and His Child etc. etc). His nuanced and realistic understanding of relationships yeilds a much richer Christmas story than you might expect in a one-hour kids special.  Plus, of course, you get that stunning performance by The Nightmare AKA Riverbottom Nightmare Band, who totally rock. The last poster is correct, however. Kermit was added in for later broadcasts, and is not on the DVD. This is the original as it was produced for the Canadian Broadcast Company. In summation: Jim Henson ruled, Russell Hoban rules, Riverbottom Nightmare Band rules, Emmet Otter rules.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mouse-and-His-Child/dp/0439098262/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mouse and His Child</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bargain-for-Frances-I-Can-Read-Book-2/dp/006444001X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bargain for Frances (I Can Read Book 2)</a>",1260662400,6,1367,6.349462365591398

In addition to giving this DVD to the children we all went to a play (FIRST time it has ever been done) at the Goodspeed Opera House in Haddam, CT based on this DVD. Two of the original puppets that are in the film were also onstage.

There are indeed puppet strings that you can easily see, it's obviously not CGI technology, but it's super. There's a great attention to detail and a lot of heart went into the production.

200231,3,1586683950,"I am a big Jim Henson fan and have always heard about an almost fanatical devotion to this Christmas special by other fans, although after viewing it I think it is primarily a nostalgic experience for most.  The special has an awkward pacing with some songs seemingly only in existence to lengthen the show.  Other songs, such as the Nightmare River Bottom Band are way too long and out of place and style with the rest of the special.

The highlights to me were the miniature scale special effects employed by the Henson crew, although a particular scene involving the use of marionettes seemed brazenly amateur.

The final song (a medley style song) is not 'jug band like' at all, and actually felt forced to me.  The only truly fun song (and the one that stayed in my mind afterwards) was the first (and really only ) jug band song in the special, Soul BBQ.

This is a cute special and I do not regret purchasing it, although it is obviously one of the earlier shows they attempted.  Without the rosey glasses of nostalgia to color my opinion, I would have to only recommend this to fans of the original and collectors.  For a great family Christmas special the Muppet Family Christmas is still the most well rounded, funny, and heart warming show available from the Henson group.",1229904000,,1283,4.5964912280701755

According to Wikipedia the following is the reason we may never have a full version available...
Wikapedia writes:
The original special was hosted by Kermit the Frog; however later releases edited out the frog's naration due to legal issues. While The Jim Henson Company retained ownership of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, the company sold the rights to the Muppets (including Kermit) to the Walt Disney Company in 2004.",1228608000,67,676,4.689075630252101
200239,5,1586683950,"Just a quick note that Kermit was NOT in the original version.  The original version was just as it is here, only with one extra line where Ma tells off Gretchen Fox.

Kermit did not appear as ""Narrator"" until ABC began to air it at Christmas time with other Muppets Christmas movies.  Kermit was actually introduced to give the movie more ""marquis appeal"" at Prime Time.

We watched the original on HBO when I was a kid, and all remember the day it aired on Broadcast TV because the show we had grown to love was initially unrecognizable.

This was an intense labor of love by Jim Henson and team over a season break from the Muppet Show.  It had little resemblances to the Muppets as Henson's whole intention was to create a world with Puppetry that was more compelling than animation and was a removal from what people had grown to know about the Muppets...it was ABC's idea to add Kermit.",1228521600,3,892,4.4753086419753085
200240,2,1586683950,"This is another one of those times when doing some reseach before purchasing is a good thing.  Once I saw the new cover art on this title, I mistakenly assumed that it must be a revised version of this classic TV special with the ""Kermit"" scenes restored. What it turned out to be is a case of misleading packaging.  Yes, there is new cover art, but it's only on the cardboard slipcase over the DVD. Once you remove it, you find that the artwork on the actual DVD box underneath is from the 2005 release. In fact, that's what this disc actually is; it is EXACTLY the same as the 2005 edition, no more no less.",1228348800,6,609,4.241379310344827

Even some of the songs are edited or shortened.  I hope the full, unedited version of this classic show will be released soon.  My rating is due to this not being the full version.

My siblings and I grew up with this and still love it; we watched it on Christmas day this year.  I have a 3-year-old son and he loves it.  Highly recommended to all.
P.S.  I recommend this version over the one with the Kermit the Frog narration.  That narration was intrusive and didn't fit with the film or story, anyway.  It was more like a celebrity cameo in the old Muppet days, and made the film feel more like a T.V. show than the movie it is.",1199836800,2,751,4.321428571428571

Even I think that I need to be more appreciative for the things that are important, which aren't things at all, rather than being all consumed at what I am going to get for so-and-so. I don't think my 2 yo gets it yet, but she does understand other moral lessons in the movie, & I don't think it's too preachy.

The kids compared the talent contest to American Idol and felt really bad that Emmitt was so poor that he had to make his own instrument instead of borrowing one from the school.

Due to contractual issues with Disney (who now own the Kermit likeness) this version has lost the introduction and closing done by Kermit.  But I didn't miss it.

And the ""Making Of"" video is excellent, with 2005 interviews with Henson's daughter, Paul Williams the composer, and others, as well as out-takes from the original filming.  And some of the stuff that wound up on the 'cutting room floor' is made available too.

There has been some disppointed people with this product, but personally I find it to be more polished. Kermit the Frog was not a part of the original release of this classic. Kermit was added later on to make it more family friendly due to the familiarity of Kermit. Granted I do not remember this special without Kermit as a child, however the extras on this version are priceless and make up for it. Kermit really didn't do anything more than narrate so he wasn't really all that important to the story. The story is just amazingly charming.

First, there is no Kermit on this dvd.  The introduction, the ending and the segue ways feel very choppy as a result.  Secondly, there are a number of jokes that have been cut out, apparently to make room for ad time during the ABC broadcasts.  I watched this show on HBO for years and years and watching this version really really made me mad.  I want to point out that if you click on the dvd box to see the large image, that is where it is mentioned that it is the ""New Edition Without Kermit Introduction.""  Note also that Amazon has not provided a plot summary, as it does for most of its products.  I read plot summaries from other websites, compared the packaging and titles, and decided this version might not be as bad as the other reviewers seemed to think it was.  But it is.  I don't think there is such a thing as a DVD edition of this film as it originally appeared on HBO.  The Jim Henson people need to get their act together and put out a complete, unabridged edition.  Until then, if you want the songs, the sensibilities and the moral of this story enough to ignore that it has been senselessly butchered, then $10.00 may not be too much to spend to hold you over.",1166313600,119,1338,4.26984126984127

There is no ""right"" version, and this edition includes all the extra bits as bonus material just to be sure. Yes, Kermit is gone, but to be honest I didn't even notice that because his intro and outro aren't actually a part of the story.

If you already have a copy of this film that you really feel is the definitive version, then I'd recommend keeping that and buying this just for the bonus material -- it's a modest investment for you die-hard fans.

For people who have never seen Emmet Otter, go ahead and buy this or rent it. It is a great story, with great music and I think children today will still enjoy it.  However, for those of us Old School Emmet fans, it is hard to watch something we can almost recite entirely by memory and see meaningless edits that do nothing to add to the story but do much to take away from its original rhythm.  The Kermit scene brought us 70's kids into the story and made us feel like it would be worth listening to.  Seeing him at the end, in his turtleneck sweater was a great book end.

 I agree. Kermit should be in here, and money shouldnt be an issue...the loyal fans should be the top consideration.

  Having said that, i want All Emmet Otter fans to know that they MUST watch this DVD. If you don't want to buy it, then please atleast rent it. The behind the scenes documentary is fabulous, and it's almost as good as the actual show itself!

  You get to see interviews with the actual people that ""puppeted"" or in this case ""Muppeted"" Emmet and some of the other characters.

  You get to see behind the scenes footage of the people on the set doing their work.

  Jim Henson's daughter is one of the primary interviewees, detailing her father's special devotion to the Emmet Otter story and to making it come alive in this special.

 You get to see and hear from the people who made the actual Puppets/Muppets, and you also get to see how they got Emmet to row the boat on the River that flows through Frogtown Hollow.

 You get to hear an exclusive excerpt of a song that was going to be used in the special, but which was later deleted and never used.

 Also there are funny ""Bloopers"", a ""sing-along"", clips of the musical segments of the show, and of course the behind the scenes documentary.

 Emmet Fans, trust me, a fellow Emmet fan, you owe it to yourself to see that documentary. It gives you a new appreciation for all of the work that it took to make Emmet come alive. You will love the documentary, plus it's pretty long, and is full of info, interviews, never before seen footage, clips from the show, etc

  Dont rob yourself of the chance to see this great documentary.

 If you do, the money seekers who edited Kermit out of this will win, because they get their money and you miss out on enjoying the documentary.

 Please, watch the documentary.

 All Emmet Otter fans owe it to themselves to see it.

 I thought of you all when i watched the DVD, and I felt sad that you didn't see the documentary.

 It is nearly as good as the Emmet show itself.

 Please, watch it, and have fun.

 This DVD enriches the Emmet Otter experience.

 For the bonuses alone, it is worth it.

The facts- Yes, Kermit's BRIEF scenes have been cut. Yes, this is a shame, but there's nothing to be done about it. The plain fact of the matter is that the Kermit scenes were short, and have absolutely nothing to do with the actual story. Their absence doesn't affect the plot or flow of the special one bit.

To not buy this DVD based on Kermit's absence is to miss out on some truly wonderful special features. Included here are all the deleted scenes fans were missing, photo galleries, and an absolutely great hour-long documentary.

Also, no Muppet fan will want to miss the hilarious sequence of bloopers which show off the great wit of Frank Oz.

HIT has shown with both this and the Fraggle Rock Complete First Season that they truly care about the work of Jim Henson. Both are tremendous DVD's which have had a lot of love and effort put into them to make them special. It's a lot more than can be said for Disney, whose Complete First Season of The Muppet Show was very lacking in the way of special features.
