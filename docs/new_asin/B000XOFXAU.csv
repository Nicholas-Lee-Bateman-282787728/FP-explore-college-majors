3004528,5,B000XOFXAU,"Watching this movie is a groundbreaking experience!  It thoroughly explores the orb phenomena and gives us real proof that orbs, which are golden spheres of light, exist and have consciousness.  The Mead family, who are the creators of this film, have done their homework.  We see that orbs have been with us through time, and appear to be showing up more frequently now that we can view them through the medium of digital photography. The filmmakers take us on a journey exploring all about orbs and how they manifest. They show in depth interviews with people who have had experience in studying orbs, including two physicists who look at  the science of the phenomenon and address doubts and skepticism. The images of the orbs are incredibly beautiful, and we can see that orbs respond to love and joy.  I came away from this movie feeling uplifted and with an expanded understanding of reality.  Best of all, I can take digital pictures of orbs and experience them for myself.",1201392000,52,980,4.803571428571429
3004529,5,B000XOFXAU,"The film is not just about Orbs! It's good material to realy go to the depth of 'we all are one' or 'we are all one'. And please expand your concept of WE :)) By watching the movie it even became clear what WE are. And even that may be just a part of what we are.

I do think our dimension (or we are) is shifting towards a new dimension (or maybe even beyond what I/we can imagine). A world filled with love and peace is possible!

cause by watching this film you don't become a believer  .  if you are missing the male god in the sky watching your every move , if you need replacement for gee-O-dee because you simply want to stuff gods  empty place in your heart , here is something new for you orbs .
science and technology seemed to have destroyed god and believe, but now tata they are helping us to believe  in what ever we like . you can capture orbs with your own digital camera , provided it is a cheap one , cause good cameras don't show any  artifacts , hmm strange .
never mind , lets not talk about technical stuff , the film never does either , why to bother .
we leave it to the so called experts , if you don't believe them it is because your consciousness is not evolved.
the experts in this film are  neo-human , leaders , they came to show us the way , hurrah.",1224460800,3,946,4.164835164835165
3004568,5,B000XOFXAU,"As soon as I finished watching I ran to my photos to see how many orbs I had unknowingly caught in the past. TONS! Ok, so I decided to make sure my digital camera lens was perfectly clean, then took pics at my grandson's birthday party which is also the 4th of July. There was no mistaking the number of ""excited"" orbs caught in the pics. I also took pics in relaxed scenes, and again orbs in some of them. The orbs seem to enjoy children, and especially Christmas, birthdays, family gatherings, and my dog. I'm delighted with this dvd and what I've learned from it.",1215734400,12,566,4.349056603773585
3004569,5,B000XOFXAU,"This is a very interesting film.  I recommend it to anyone interested in Orbs or anyone who wants to learn more about the phenomenon.

The film consists mainly of lots of Orb photos interspersed with interviews with people who have spent years studying them.  Among them, Miceal Ledwith, of What the Bleep fame, who has taken over 100,000 Orb photos and probably has one of the largest collections in the world.

We also hear from J.Z. Knight, a physicist, and an artist.  The film doesn't attempt to prove, disprove, or scientifically analyze the Orbs.  Rather, it speaks to what it could mean for humanity to be in contact with ""beings"" from another dimension that seem to be attracted to love and happiness.

Could Orbs be higher dimensional beings?  Are they here to tell us something?  To usher in a new understanding?  Watch the film and choose for yourself.",1202169600,40,864,4.777027027027027

3239064,1,B000XOFXAU,"watch this film only when you already believe in orbs being little, cute,loving  light-creatures .
cause by watching this film you don't become a believer  .  if you are missing the male god in the sky watching your every move , if you need replacement for gee-O-dee because you simply want to stuff gods  empty place in your heart , here is something new for you orbs .
science and technology seemed to have destroyed god and believe, but now tata they are helping us to believe  in what ever we like . you can capture orbs with your own digital camera , provided it is a cheap one , cause good cameras don't show any  artifacts , hmm strange .
never mind , lets not talk about technical stuff , the film never does either , why to bother .
we leave it to the so called experts , if you don't believe them it is because your consciousness is not evolved.
the experts in this film are  neo-human , leaders , they came to show us the way , hurrah.",1224460800,3,946,4.164835164835165
3239065,5,B000XOFXAU,"As soon as I finished watching I ran to my photos to see how many orbs I had unknowingly caught in the past. TONS! Ok, so I decided to make sure my digital camera lens was perfectly clean, then took pics at my grandson's birthday party which is also the 4th of July. There was no mistaking the number of ""excited"" orbs caught in the pics. I also took pics in relaxed scenes, and again orbs in some of them. The orbs seem to enjoy children, and especially Christmas, birthdays, family gatherings, and my dog. I'm delighted with this dvd and what I've learned from it.",1215734400,12,566,4.349056603773585
3239066,5,B000XOFXAU,"This is a very interesting film.  I recommend it to anyone interested in Orbs or anyone who wants to learn more about the phenomenon.

The film consists mainly of lots of Orb photos interspersed with interviews with people who have spent years studying them.  Among them, Miceal Ledwith, of What the Bleep fame, who has taken over 100,000 Orb photos and probably has one of the largest collections in the world.

We also hear from J.Z. Knight, a physicist, and an artist.  The film doesn't attempt to prove, disprove, or scientifically analyze the Orbs.  Rather, it speaks to what it could mean for humanity to be in contact with ""beings"" from another dimension that seem to be attracted to love and happiness.

Could Orbs be higher dimensional beings?  Are they here to tell us something?  To usher in a new understanding?  Watch the film and choose for yourself.",1202169600,40,864,4.777027027027027
8228855,1,B000XOFXAU,"I am watching this video and I lose my money because they don't say anything really, they just say they are around and you can't see them only on pictures and nobody seen them.  I saw one and I didn't know it was an orb, I never knew what it was until now, after 20 years that happened to me and I wanted information and this video really is not informative.
I was interested in what they found out about orbs not that they think people can see only in pictures.
I am really disappointed, I am glad that I just rented the movie and I didn't sign in for Gaia movies because if all are like this I am really not interested.
I am so upset with this movie",1526256000,,651,4.007692307692308
8228856,1,B000XOFXAU,"Did I have to even rate it 1 star? I was excited to sit down and watch a show on orbs. They fascinate me. Could they be dust? A photographic anomaly? A spirit? Who knows? Well you won't get any answers from this film. If I want to be preached at, I would go to church. If you need preaching at, by all means watch this film.",1523750400,,324,3.8507462686567164
8228857,5,B000XOFXAU,Orbs have been fun to notice and learn about.  This book is great.  I had this type of image in my mind before I saw this book.  I love the pictures/graphics.  This is my passion so now I can go and start painting.,1500595200,,214,3.9069767441860463
