8346118,5,B001VEHOPI,"To preface, I'm not an MMA competitor. This means I don't already know how many options I have from the guard posion. I have been practicing a classical martial art that involves everything except the both fighters on the ground scenario. Nogueira is well known for his guard game and I wanted to see what his idea of some of the options are from that position. Other reviewers have shown how extensive the material is, but I'd like to add a few things. The techniques in question are well lit, filmed from multiple angles and have already been organized according to the starting position. Reasons are given for each approach. Each segment shows several options from each position. It gives perspective to see what some of the options are in the guard position. Positioning is important to standup martial arts, and Nogueira makes it apparent that this is the case on the ground as well. Nogueira tries to limit the opponent's options in each case to stop or slow his progression toward a more dominant position. The instruction provides methods for you to try to improve your position, submit the opponent outright, or stand up. I'd not like to find myself on the ground underneath an opponent, but this DVD goes a long way toward suggesting reasonable tactical solutions. No sane person would want an extended ground match in the street if at all possible, but murphy's law may conspire to put us there. Mr. Nogueira provides excellent information. All the person need do is provide himself conditioning and partner practice to get started. Well worth the money!",1264896000,2,1565,4.843283582089552

Guard for MMA
 Marc Wickert June 15, 2009
[...]

At the age of 11, Antonio Nogueira found himself stuck under a truck with torso and legs crushed after a drunk driver reversed into him.  Antonio says he lost a large portion of his liver, his lungs were severely damaged and his diaphragm was pulverized.

So it's no wonder the ""Ground Master of MMA"" feels at home in the guard: What human opponent could possibly be as threatening in your guard as a large truck?

Guard for MMA is part one in a trilogy being offered by Antonio Nogueira and offers excellent tuition for both the stand-up fighter who wants to add ground skills to his striking, and for the experienced grappler who is keen to add depth to his ground game by training with the best Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in MMA.

Antonio Nogueira's Guard for MMA is another high-quality product from Victory Belt and all three DVDs on offer perfectly complement Nogueira's Mastering Mixed Martial Arts: The Guard book.
