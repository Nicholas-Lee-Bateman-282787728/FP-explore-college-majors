8053917,1,B0007YBX14,"This movie was outdated, unrealistic, lacking in diversity and not worth raving about.  I was forced to watch this video as part of an inservice day when I had many other pressing things to do such as getting my classroom ready to welcome my students, so I was very annoyed by the length of the film.  I also found that the many references to God were not appropriate in the public school sector.  The overall message was positive, but one that I hope most educators already think about daily (ie helping our students to excel in their own way)!  Guy had many entertaining anecdotes, but he still didn't win me over in this film because of the many negative factors.  The classroom scenes were REALLY contrived and do not represent how adolescents would really act even twenty years ago.  I also found that while Guy was trying to emphasize accepting people for who they are and finding each person's individual strength, there was not a person of color or different nationality in the entire show which I found laughable even for a 20 year old film.  The film was really not worth the time.  Instead I would recommend more insightful, relevant and meaningful resources for educators interested in helping their students such as ""Please Stop Laughing at Me"" by Jodee Blanco, ""Reviving Ophelia"" by Mary Pipher  and ""Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys"" by Dan Kindlon.  Don't waste your time or money on this one - it won't help you or your students.",1282694400,,1465,4.709803921568628
8053918,5,B0007YBX14,"This film is a well done production that brings to home a teacher's impact on his/her students. Guy Doud's description of his own experiences plus those in his classroom provoke a deep emotional response from those who view the film. Inspiring! It motivates teachers to critically view their own classroom and the hope and dreams they have for their students. It makes all want to achieve more and strive for higher levels.

 Through his own experiences we receive a child's view of school and see how disastorous or uplifting the little things teachers do or say can be in he mind of that student.

We are often so busy that we lose sight of our purpose in the classroom. Guy brings us back to earth and touches the love and caring we wish for our students.

I know you will enjoy this film and want to share it with all your fellow teachers and staff.",1154131200,9,853,4.483870967741935
