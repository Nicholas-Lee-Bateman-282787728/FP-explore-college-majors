Here, Britney's video clips will be positioned chronologically in 3D space. Each video represents a benchmark or era in the evolution of Britney's expansive video career. Following this concept, the clips will occasionally link to highlight moments of bonus video drawn from that same point in time.

In total, there are 20 videos PLUS half of them are EXPANDED with never-before-seen footage including alternate versions, multi-angle versions, multi-audio versions, hidden bonus features and interactive surprises.

2165689,5,B00064AM62,"WOW!!!...I watched this britney spears dvd only yesterday afternoon infact,was blown away with the set-up menu.,really easy to follow and a joy to use. It's more like a computer game in a way with the display menu,i was however more tempted to go straight back to britney's very first video hits.,from her first album like for example....""Baby one more time"" plus ""You drive me crazy"" and
""Sometimes"".These music videos by far are my all time britney spears favourites.

I still carried-on watching all the other music videos,incl her hit ""Oopps i did it again"".,right up to her more recent
videos such as ""My prerogative"".Which i thought was really good.

All-in-all i think this purchase in amazon.com was well worth my while,if you are a britney fan.,then you should get this dvd.",1394755200,,783,4.969465648854962
2165690,4,B00064AM62,"has all of her videos on it. i got it to find out what was suppose to be so great about her. well, she is a very beautiful woman who can dance a little and sing a little. not very artistic or deep songs found hear. type of music you listen to at night clubs where fat bouncers tell you your not good looking enough to get in.",1390608000,,325,3.7941176470588234
2165691,1,B00064AM62,"I got this as a present back when I was a huge Britney fan and it's been collecting dust on my shelf for 9 years. I watched it through once when I first got it, but I ended up skipping through a bunch of the videos.

There aren't enough good videos to make this a good purchase. The picture quality isn't great and sound is below average. The special features aren't special at all. I would recommend just watching them on YouTube if you're interested in seeing them.",1387065600,,467,4.306818181818182
2165692,4,B00064AM62,"Everything's coming up Britney, if you like her you get enuff of her on this dvd.  My fave video is ""Everytime"", I had no idea Steven Dorff was in it.  The downfall of the dvd is the navigation.  Whoever constructed it is a total crackhead.  It's a pain to even start the dvd and play the vidz all the way thru, with the lame angles and the confusing bs on the menu.  When you play a dvd you just want to watch what's on it, not f around with the remote and try 2 figure out how 2 navigate.  It should have been made more simple instead of trying too hard to be different and ""kool"".  But the vidz are nice, alot of them follow the same formula, Brit gets her love interest or is lusting over some semi-hot white boy.",1374796800,,717,4.042553191489362
2165693,4,B00064AM62,She did it again. I purchased the dvd so I could see her videos whenever I want and can see them over and over again which I do. I purchased it used and it works great as if I purchased it new.,1373068800,,193,3.619047619047619

2165696,4,B00064AM62,"I honestly bought this spontantously, because it was for someones gift. They loved it because it has every single music video Britney Spears has every made, and they now don't have to go youtube for all the songs anymore.",1326326400,,221,4.6923076923076925

If you don't even own the DVD and you just hate Britney then why waste your time writing a whiney review? Anyway on to the review of someone who actually owns this and actually likes Britney. If you've seen Britney's music videos and you more importantly like them, then this is the compilation for you. I just set the DVD to play all the videos while I clean or whatever and take a walk back to my high school years or fall in love with Brit's dancing all over again.

I have to admit that I am not the Britney type audience but I recognize that it's a a very good production, videos are great so if you're a Britney fan I think this is a must have DVD.",1206835200,3,301,3.71875
2165708,3,B00064AM62,"This DVD can be a little hard to use, especially trying to find the alternate versions of the videos. Here is how, what they are called, and how they differ. Once the DVD gets to the main menu, choose ""Alt. View."" The screen changes and here you access the different videos. Below is the listing and what they are:

*My Prerogative (Dimentional Edit){a.k.a. Digital View} = the beginning has some additional footage of people at the party. In the video, there are 2 different ""clips"" you can watch. One clip is some additional black and white footage of her on the bed. The second ""clip"" is photos of her and other guests at the party. Also look for the astronaut from the ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" video. Access these features by pressing Enter on your remote when the word ENTER appears on your tv screen.

*Outrageous (Takes) = Unused footage from the ""Outrageous"" video. Her most infamous video due to the fact that it was never completed. Shortly after the shoot began, Britney injured her knee. After she healed, it was never finished. And yes, that IS Snoop Dogg. And NO, that is NOT Britney at the end.

*Everytime (Angle Two) = When this video starts, LET IT PLAY. Hitting ENTER will only let you see how the video originally aired. This version is footage of outtakes, false starts, etc. The majority of it is Britney standing in front of us, singing.

*Toxic (Karaoke) = Take a guess what this is, lol. It is the video with the words on the screen. Sort of. It is a version of the ""Toxic"" video never seen. It is mainly Britney dancing around with those diamonds glued onto her body. Also, the singing has been totally removed, so it is just the music. I must say it is VERY COOL to see this version. She looks so good with the fan blowing her hair all over as she dances. You can hit ENTER on your remote during the video to turn the singing on if you like, hit ENTER again to turn it back off. WARNING: turning the singing on and off causes the video to start back at the beginning. I recommend watching it twice, once with the singing off, then again with the singing on. Also, some of the words are mis-spelled. ""Your"" is used when ""you're"" is the correct version.

*I'm A Slave For You (Uncut) {a.k.a. Accapella} = More bonus footage not used in the original version. On the plus side, it means more male nipples. Hitting ENTER shows you even more bonus footage. I suggest watching it twice. The first time, let it play. The second time, hit ENTER on your remote. I had a hard time using this video, especially when I hit the ANGLE button on my remote, took me to all kinds of weird shots. I eventually got irritated with all the bonus footage and stopped trying to find it all in this video.

*Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (DLMBTLTK Outtakes) = Not sure what this was. It appeared to be outtakes set to a remix/instrumental version of the song. Also mixed in are clips of other videos. THE MOST BIZARRE version of one of her videos yet. Also very short, less than 2 minutes long.

*Stronger (Outtakes) = You guessed it... A neat little surprise it the home video footage of Britney when she was younger mixed in. It is also like a remix of 'Stronger.' Also less than 2 minutes long.

*Oops!...I Did It Again (Uncuts) = The original video with the begging trip to space removed. Instead, the whole video is Britney in front of us, singing and dancing in that red outfit. At the end, hit ENTER to see more outtakes. Britney does some funny stuff on the outtakes. It ends abruptly.

*You Drive Me Crazy (Mix) = Not sure how to explain this version. I guess it is the same video playing at different times on the same screen?? Also includes outtakes. LESS THAN ONE MINUTE LONG!!

*...Baby, One More Time (Uncut) = Hitting ENTER when the word ENTER is on the screen takes you to the alternate version. Nothing special, just some outtakes. And we see that that really IS Britney doing a back-flip.

OVERALL = Disappointed with this DVD, it sounds much better than it really is. The menus are hard to use, and the box makes it sound like there are hours of bonus footage. That is a lie. The alternate versions of the videos are much shorter. I could have arranged this DVD in an easy-to-use format. All this bonus footage to the videos could have been done in a better way.",1203206400,9,4286,4.419518377693283
2165709,5,B00064AM62,"After 4 studio albums & a Greatest Hits collection, Britney had already knocked up a total of 18 singles. All of these are included here.

There is also a clip for `Outrageous'. This video was never finished due to Britney injuring her knee on set. She required surgery & had to cancel the remainder of her `Onyx Hotel' tour. Ouch.
  As a final treat, the remix for `Overprotected' is also included. This extremely popular remix has it's very own video, completely different to the original video.

And since this a dvd release, you can play with the multiangle feature on your remote. And if you already weren't getting enough, some of the videos can be viewed uncut!!

2165710,5,B00064AM62,"for all that comment on britney about her music base on her personal life, then shame on you.

a true music should be judge solely on the artist performance, not about her-who-care-personal-life, the music is what we enjoy not her-who-care-personal-life, imagine how you be if all, around the world stuck their nose in your personal life?

britney, I like her music and performance, but not her-who-care-personal-life, because I too have a personal life that I don't want the world to know about! and so do you.

and also if you're not a pop fan than don't comment on pop music, it just like a caveman visiting a 21st century city, don't know nothing and it would be a wast of time and words for those who wanting to hear comments from a true expert.

2165712,5,B00064AM62,"Did you get a chance to see Pacino's movie ""Simone""? The premise: Hollywood uses a computer program to create and mold the biggest female star ever.

It's pretty obvious (and has always been) that Britney has very little musical talent, but they molded her into the biggest music icon in 2000. On this DVD you get a chance to relive her early greatness in videos like ""Sometimes"", ""Baby one more time"", ""Oops I did it again"". Those were such wonderful videos (directed by Nigel Dick). Britney looked so beautiful and happy. It's very shocking to see what that happy little girl became today. Nobody would have thought that this squeeqy clean girl would be prancing around hollywood with no panties, on drugs, and shaving her head bald. These video's are not only entertaining, but they are also a window into the Britney transformation. The video ""Lucky"" from her oops album in particular is strange, because Britney really became the Lucky girl (lost in an image, with nobody there to wake her up). By the 3rd album, you can see Britney smiling less, becoming more sexually deviant, and singing ""Im a slave for you"". Her last album has shocking video's such as ""Everytime"", where Britney dies in the bathtub (from what looks like suicide). Sure, she pops out of the tub at the end to let us know she is okay, but it's still very strange. Also contained on this DVD is Britney's unfinished video ""Outrageous"" (from her 4th album). Britney is totally out of her element in this video, pretending to be a home-girl in the ghetto. She jumps on snoop dog (the rapper) and licks his face like catwomen (from batman 2). That was quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.

Well, Britney just got out of rehab, and I hope she will be okay. People on the internet are already betting who will father her next child. Aside from what you believe about Britney's lack of talent, she is a human. That's right, she isn't Simone. She is a human, and makes mistakes just like anyone else. She tried to entertain us. The least we can do is give her some sympathy and hope she finds her way.

by the way, buy the ""in the zone"" dual disk if you want to see Britney's mega mix video on DVD.",1174435200,3,2187,4.5456852791878175

2165714,5,B00064AM62,"I love watching this DVD while on the treadmill. It is very entertaining and the music is fun to walk to.

2165717,5,B00064AM62,"....which might not be saying a lot, if you've never liked Britney Spears or the pre-packaged pop she became known for. But I'll bet a decent number of you put down cash for one or two of her cds five or six years ago, for the simple reasons that her songs were catchy as hell and she looked good in those tight costumes she wore. Well the songs certainly didn't have any staying power, but the videos sure do. We have twenty(!) videos here, covering everything from ""baby one more time"" to ""toxic"" and ""everytime."" Pretty much everything you remember from mtv is on here, including a few lesser-known ones that didn't make mass release in North America. It's a pretty complete collection by any standard, and there's also tons of bonus clips included, for a running time of over 2.5 hours. That's a lot of Britney.

Production values were always Britney's strong points, and these videos are where she shines. I haven't been a Britney fan in years, but I find this disc a nice time capsule of a very brief and sugary period in music.

2165721,4,B00064AM62,"Although Britney's singing ability isn't in the same category as, say Mariah or Janet, her talent for picking just the right crew to create and produce her videos is top-notch.  They all tell their little stories (most enhance the songs they're geared for)  For example: I'm not a big fan of her My Prerogative version but the video was superb (with the exception of K-Fed as her love interest--love is SO blind).
This DVD is great in the fact that it has all the ""radio-played"" songs as well as a few others.
If you can't stand her singing but love to admire a beautiful shape, hit the ""mute"" button.

One thing I love about all of Britney's videos is all of them tell a story. 5 stars is not enough for this amazing piece of work, Britney is a true talent. Another thing I just adore of her is that she can pull off being sexy but sweet at the same time, some other artists are either too good its fake or sluts, but Britney's style is sexy and sweet at the same time. Take, the toxic video, she pulls off wearing a very sexy diamond covered outfit, but the whole spirit of it is sweet. The toxic music video as well as the others have scenes, but also their is an alternate version and for toxic its Toxic karaoke where the whole thing Britney is dancing in the diamond outfit the whole time.

But I noticed that there aren't many reviews of this particular product so much as reviews of Britney herself.  Obviously I am a fan (I can only imagine fans would be the ones interested in buying this DVD.)  She's made a few mistakes in her life(Walking into a public restroom BAREFOOT for one!!!) but as far as her music is concerned I think it's great!  No, she doesn't have a brilliant amazing voice.  Her voice can't be compared to Mariah's, Christina's or Celine's.  But if that's what we wanted, those are the artists whose CDs we'd buy.  Britney isn't a singer, she's an entertainer.  And obviously she's very entertaining otherwise she would never have sold so many albums!  And to those especially whiny people who complain that the younger generations don't know good music...Piss Off!  Everyone has different tastes.  My best friend doesn't particularly care for Britney (she prefers Metallica who I believe suck!!!) but she absolutely respects my opinion as I do hers.  And, by the way, liking Britney's music doesn't mean I don't also like ""talented"" artists of the past.  As much as I love Brit, I also love Aretha Franklin, The Beatles, Cher, Ray Charles, Carol King and many many other great artists.  It's called being eclectic.  Maybe bitchy haters should try it!  As far as her version of My Perogotive goes, it is a wonderful rendition!  In my opinion, WAY better than Bobby Brown's.  I don't consider his version to be quite the ""classic"" that some reviewers do.  At best is was a mediocre pop song made great by Britney.  But I don't begrudge anyone's right to think differently.  All I'm saying is if you came on here to review the dvd, then you should do that.  If you just came on here to bash Britney, don't waste your time.  People who hate her are most likely not going to look up her products on Amazon to read reviews and if you are trying to change people's minds about her, well, her fans aren't going to stop loving her because you said she sucks.  All you're doing is making them mad.  And if that's all you want to do then you should grow up!!!  Don't be so pathetic!  Now for my review of the DVD:  I LOVE IT!  I don't think I've ever been disappointed by any of her videos so it is great to be able to see them all in one sitting.  My Favorite is absolutely ""Toxic""  so fun!!!  I like her more recent music, but no one can deny the pop-power of ""...Baby One More Time"" and (You Drive Me) Crazy!  I love all her videos!!!  The confusing menus don't really bother me so I can honestly say I was not at all disappointed in my purchase.  Totally worth every penny!",1120003200,2,2707,4.4439918533604885

I applaud Mrs. Spears-Federline for using her assets while she still has them. I know that I am going to get blasted for saying that, but even the people in the ""good old days"" as some of you like to call them used sex and scandal to sell their records and I must say that listening to some of them now...they could have used the help of a synthesizer themselves.

--------------------------------------------------

It's great to finally have all of Britney's videos on one DVD. One video is different from a previously released version. ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" contains different film clips and some different shots than the version on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossroads-DVD/dp/B00005JKWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Crossroads"" DVD</a>. This means that there are, at least, two different versions of this music video. Also the movie clips on this disc's version are squeezed (they were not anamorphically unsqueezed).

Some have complained about not having a 5.1 audio track. Since most (if not all) of the videos were originally created with a stereo audio track, I'm quite happy with what is on the DVD. Better they leave well enough alone, then use the studio recordings of the songs to make a 5.1 mix, and thus ruin the videos by leaving out sound effects and the such (like Sony did on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Billy-Joel-The-Essential-Video-Collection-DVD/dp/B00005RT35/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Billy Joel: The Essential Video Collection DVD</a>).

However, that's not to say that they didn't mess up this DVD in other areas. The menu design has got to be the worst I have ever seen on any DVD. It's very confusing and hard to navigate. No explanation is ever given as to what the key, dice, and clock icons do. Key gives you a rather unhelpful menu explanation, and dice and clock give you a random video (as far as I can tell). Moving the highlight around is more of a chore than it needs to be. You press Up, only to be taken to the left. You press Left, only to be taken up. It's very illogical. To make matters worse, if you linger for more than a few seconds on any menu screen, it changes to another screen, thus losing you your place.

Who's idea was it to present all of the videos in reverse chronological order instead of forward chronological order? I'd rather see the evolution of Britney instead of the devolution. Would it have been that difficult to present an option to view them in either order?

The enhanced ""alternate"" videos are a great idea in theory, but they would have worked better as standard bonus features. Some can be confusing with prompts placed way too late (prompts are supposed to tell you to switch angles or audio tracks or to press Enter on your remote) and no clear indication of what the ""enhanced features"" of each video are (sometimes you're left wondering what the heck it is you're watching). The only one, to me, that truly works is ""My Prerogative"" (the camcorder clips), though that's dampened by the advertising of Sony's Cyber-Shot camera (including branding the website address on the screen).

In case you need more information before you buy, here's a list of what the ""alternate"" videos contain.

My Prerogative
* ENTER when prompted on film to view it.
* ENTER, LEFT, RIGHT on camcorder to view clips. DOWN to go back to video.

Outrageous
* NON-INTERACTIVE - Unused footage, dance sequence.

Everytime
* ANGLE 1 - Regular video, ENTER when prompted on paparazzi
* ANGLE 2 - Britney sings to camera

Toxic
[video is of Britney clad only is jewels with lyrics places over her ""bare"" b-r-e-a-s-t-s]
* AUDIO 1 - Instrumental
* AUDIO 2 - Regular Song

I'm A Slave 4 U
[ignore all ENTER prompts as they just switch angles or audio]
* AUDIO 1 - Acapella (vocals only)
* AUDIO 2 - Regular Song
* ANGLE 1 - Britney close-up in front of green screen.
* ANGLE 2 - Regular video, then one long uncut master shot.
* ANGLE 3 - Regular video with one clapboard shot.

Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know
* NON-INTERACTIVE - Outtakes from this and other videos edited together, instrumental audio.

Stronger
* NON-INTERACTIVE - Outtakes plus one home video clip, instrumental audio with occassional vocals.

* Oops!...I Did It Again
NON-INTERACTIVE - One long uncut master shot.

(You Drive Me) Crazy
* NON-INTERACTIVE - Double video and audio, left video plays in left audio channel, right video plays in right audio channel, plus outtakes.

...Baby One More Time
[ignore ENTER-UNCUT prompt too]
* ANGLE 1 - Regular Video (with some outtakes?)
* ANGLE 2 - Uncut Master Shots, ENTER-ONE MORE TIME prompt takes you to the hallway uncut master shot.

There are two hidden features (easter eggs) in the ""alternate"" videos, which I personally found.

-- My Prerogative (Alternate Version): After you press ENTER at the film projector prompt to see the film footage, press ENTER again *while* viewing the film footage to see black & white footage of Britney singing the song while rolling around in the bed (Title 59). There is no ENTER prompt on screen during the film footage, so this singing in bed footage is hidden.

-- Oops!...I Did It Again (Alternate Version): Press ENTER at the start of the video to go to outtakes from the video (Title 88 & 89). There is no ENTER prompt on screen, so the Outtakes are hidden. (There is an Enter prompt on the Outtakes which takes you back to the alternate version.

All of the videos, both regular and alternate, have fantastic video and audio quality, as you would expect from DVD. I did notice that the ""Baby One More Time"" audio is a bit lower than all the others. I also noticed two defects, which appear in several different DVD players.

-- Me Against The Music (Title 7 & 26) - At 3:16 as Madonna is on the swing singing ""Just work your body and let it go,"" there is one frame of a man within the shot. This frame is a still from the ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" video (Title 18 & 37 at 4:02).

-- Crazy (Title 20 & 39) - At 3:10 is a minor freeze or jitter as Britney puts her hand on her head on the lyric ""But it feels alright.""

Finally, the 160 minutes run time listed on back seems incorrect. Even with all of the bonus features, I don't think it totals 2 hrs 40 mins. I'm very glad to have all of Britney's videos on one DVD, I just wish they did a better job overall.",1115164800,4,6564,4.907859078590786
2165746,4,B00064AM62,"First of all, I have to say that I can appreciate that people have their own opinions about Britney, and although personally I've strayed from Loving her, to viewing her as glorified white trash,  this is supposed to be about the DVD, NOT BRITNEY, I think that using a review to criticize Britney is just proof that some people have nothing better to do with their time.

But her, let's just call it ""different"" personality aside, her videos are great, even if the songs sometimes aren't.

This DVD is amazing because it contains EVERY music Video Britney has to offer (up to its release date- the Megamix and ""Do Somethin"" Videos were released afterwards.

Besides just offering EVERY video released domestically, it includes Alternate Versions (like the European Version of ""Overprotected"") and even those not released in the US (Like ""I Love Rock and Roll) to top it, some of the videos have ""Expanded Functinality"" which includes everything from Behind the Scenes, to Karaoke, to Alternate versions, to ALternate Angles, and then there's even more stuff hidden throught the discs Menus

The only downside, although the Menus are amazingly High Tech, and Visually amazing, they can be hard to navigate on a DVD remote.

It would've been a little fun to see some of the bloopers though, Britney's tumble in both the ""Sometimes"" and ""Outrageous Videos, but as content goes, this DVD is superb, the only Artist DVD that offered more is Toni Braxton's ""From Toni With Love""- which, besides being much easier to navigate, offered all of her album videos, alternate versions (Spanish Versions and some pretty cool remixes)- and even some live stuff, EPK and album promotions, Live footage)

Even though Brintey'[s become - well- what she is now, this DVD is nice to help remember Britney the way she was, a little racey, sexy, and just acting Crazy (and singing ti) instead of being it.",1114473600,3,1883,4.90251572327044
2165747,1,B00064AM62,"britney spears is all about one thing: media hype! The reason she is still around is because of her stupid marriage & now that she's pregnant that'll give her another excuse to be on more magazine covers & get more attention. She's all about her personal life & the foolish things she does in it. She's not about music, she's not an artist. Everything she did, Janet & Madonna had already done a decade ago. She just rips them off! britney will never be the popular pop mega star she used to be. She's too much of a media joke, that's why her GH did so poorly. It barely sold a million copies here in the states. Maybe she's better off just being a wife & mother & leaving music to people who can actually sing.",1113350400,5,711,4.235294117647059

The navigation is a bit tricky at first but it will become more natural the more you play around with it. The quality of the DVD I would say is decent. The picture quality is sharp and crisp and vivid. This DVD is also packed with many extra features, although some are really unneceassry, but it's nice that they're there. There are alternate versions of ""Everytime"" and ""Toxic"" and an acapella of ""Slave 4 U"" and bloopers in between. Some are actually quite funny and it really shows Britney's fun side. There is also a hidden alternate version of ""My Prerogative"" which I think is really cool.

Of course Madonna was the best suited person to be on a CD with Spears since neither can sing a lick.  I notice that most reviews here get very sexual in their writings.  It's simply that Spears made that cleap slut category all her own.  It's time to retire her G-string and take it where it belongs.

Come on, be yourself, don't try to be like Madonna. You're never going to be like her so get over it. If you can't handle the press then maybe you shouldn't have thought about becoming ""famous"" in the first place.

01 My Prerogative:

It's a ""dimensional edit"", where you can see fils in the middle of the video, and there appears a camera where you see pictures and videos of Britney during the making of the video and the people who were invited to it.

02 Outrageous:

The video lasts about 40 sec; Britney didn't finish it, and in the expanded version, you just see Britney dancing more, more and more...

03 Everytime:

This video includes a second angle, where you just see Britney in an aisle with that white clothes and joking with the crew and stuff

04 Toxic:

This video in the expanded version is really cool, because it's a karaoke version, where you see the lyrics in the screen and Britney moving her lips with the song, and you can select if you just want the music or if you want the full song with her voice

11 I'm A Slave 4 U:

Just like ""Everytime"", but this video has 3 angles, y you can select if Britney sings acapella or with the music behind; in one of the angles is the regular video; in other, there's just Britney singing the song with the green screen behind her, and in other, is like the music video, with dance and stuff, but the camera films only to Britney

12 Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know:

This expanded version lasts only 2 minutes, and it's not the video, it's Britney having fun in the trees and making funny faces to the camera

13 Stronger:

This is one of my favourite expanded versions, because Britney makes funny faces too, and she laughs, and the camerographer films Britney's mistakes, like when she can't stand up on the chair

15 Oops!...I Did It Again:

This is the full song, and Britney is singing to the camera, and behind her, the men should have been moving their arms and they don't do anything and Britney don't see it, and there's also included when she is on the white thing and the camera is filming over her face and she makes funny faces and laughs and make mistakes

18 (You Drive Me) Crazy:

This video includes some parts of the making of the video, and it's like the original music video

20 ...Baby One More Time:

This expanded video has 2 angles, and in the 2nd angle, there's Britney with her sport clothes singing the song, always in the same place; and when you watch 1 minute of the video, appears the phrase ""Enter one more time"", and if you press the Enter button right in that time, you will see a 40 sec. clip where Britney dances a part of the song and the 1st chorus in the school aisle.

This DVD calls the normal music videos ""overview"", and the expanded versions, ""alt. view""; and there's also a random mode, pressing with the enter button in one of the options in the main menu.

This DVD isn't region 1, it's region 0 (All regions), so buy it, and don't get nervous if your DVD player isn't region 1, because it'll play it anyway.

All the normal music videos (overview) last 72min

All the expanded version (alt. view), and the credits, and the introduction last 88min.

Enjoy it, because it's Britney's best DVD ever!",1104019200,8,3265,4.35702479338843

the DVD- normal non shiny DVD Edition.

WOW first of all, I wanna say is that this DVD is totally jam packed. 20 Britney videos, yes thats right, 20!!

Pros

It has 20 videos! Features a visually stunning menu, the alt-versions of the videos are a nice treat just to add to the 20 videos!

All her singles (videos) are on here

Its about the same price of a regular Britney DVD but got 10 x more stuff on it!

CONS!

When first on it, the controls are weird, like you push up or down it will move somewhere else, but don't worry! You get used to it

The alt versions are hard to find for 1st timers, like me!

I thought because it said ALTERNATIVE VERSION at the bottom, it was ON the Alt-version. But nooooooooo it is the normal video, you actually have to click on the Alt logo, it will take you to another menu with ALL the alternative version videos.

On first view the angle features look like they don't work and it just looks like a normal video, but don't be fooled! it actually happens! pretty cool!

The ""My Prerogative"" video is over sluttizied! Just right! lol, its Britneys most sexual video since ""Slave 4 U""

2165802,1,B00064AM62,"That's all Britney ever was and where her talent always laid.  She really knows how to tart up a stage.  As for the salivating sad juveniles here (or is it her family that's posting all the rave reviews?), her lagging album sales tell the truth.  Just like her Idol, Madonna, this woman can't sing a Lick!  Just a cheesy T&A routine that's getting as old as her waistline.  I saw her in New Orleans and she's getting pretty flabby.  Too much partying in Las Vegas!",1103932800,3,464,4.4
2165803,5,B00064AM62,"Amazing dvd, videos and extras..she looks so hot in the cd and dvd cover!.",1103500800,,74,4.357142857142857
2165804,5,B00064AM62,"The impact that Britney Spears has had on popular culture over the past six years is nothing short of phenomenal. Her music always goes to No. 1 somewhere in the world, and with album sales of 65 million worldwide you can definitely see why. She's one of the biggest female stars in the history of the world and her status only seems to increase, seemingly day by day. Everyone has an opinion on her - you either love her or hate her. Luckily for her record label, millions love her, and that's nothing that the haters can take away.

Since the dawn of MTV, artists have noticed the power and influence that music videos can have on sales, most notably Michael Jackson and Madonna. Britney only continued this trend when she stormed onto the scene in late 1998 and the video to her debut single had the world talking. She created a buzz from that one video, which proves it's an excellent use of communication and promotion to the consumer market. This DVD, therefore, is a perfect look at Britney's video career and how visuals have helped define her as a woman and artist.

This DVD, ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative,"" is the perfect companion to the record of the same name. Some people say it's too early for Britney to release a Greatest Hits album because she's not had enough truly great hits, but the same can surely not be said for this DVD. It proudly boasts 20 smashing, iconic music videos in sharp DVD-audio quality from the past six years that have received millions of spins from music channels all over the world. These videos accompany Britney's massive hit singles and have definitely helped define her as a world class superstar, as well as cementing her in music video history as a natural when it comes to performing in front of the camera.

The DVD works in reverse order as the first video on the DVD is that of ""My Prerogative,"" Britney's latest single and 13th UK Top 5 hit. The moment where Britney drives the car into the swimming pool is absolutely amazing and so classy - definitely a classic Britney video moment. From here on the videos just charge along, from the never-before-seen ""Outrageous"" featuring Snoop Dogg, to the controversy of the ""Everytime"" video. The static video to one of Britney's most popular songs, ""Toxic,"" is here with all the sharp colour that made it such a visual feast at the start of 2004. There's too many videos to mention separately here, but the highlights include the four aforementioned videos, along with the Madonna-duet ""Me Against The Music."" The ""Boys (CO-ED Remix)"" video is also very visually appealing with its dark colours in green, black and blue. Mike Myers and Pharrell Williams also star in the video.

""I'm A Slave 4 U"" is also another one of my favourite Britney videos because it was the first time Britney stuck two fingers up at Middle America and just decided to be herself. She is amazing in this sweaty, funky and sensual video. ""Stronger"" is also another amazing video with lots of black, whilst ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" features that now-iconic red catsuit that had so many older men hot under the collar! Who else could make a video about a female sexpot living on Mars who seduces an innocent astronaut, and still pull off one of 2000's biggest selling singles?! The video to ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"" had Middle America up in arms as they claimed Britney was exploiting innocent young girls into prostituting themselves! Yeah, whatever - if they're stupid enough to walk around with no clothes on, it's their own fault. Britney is an entertainer, and to dress scantily-clad is to appeal to the world. It's part of the job. Anyway, this video was damn hot and held me transfixed at her beauty.

And of course, who could forget the video to ""...Baby One More Time?"" By far the most famous video on this DVD, it swept through the world and propelled Britney to almost instant iconic status. The Catholic schoolgirl look was her own genius idea, and the rest is history. That a young, innocent 16-year-old girl could conquer the music industry in a few months was astonishing, and is something she will never come close to achieving, no matter how many albums she sells!

The other videos that feature on this DVD are ""I Love Rock 'N' Roll,"" ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,"" ""Overprotected - The Darkchild Remix,"" ""Overprotected (International Video),"" ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,"" ""Lucky,"" ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart,"" ""Born To Make You Happy"" and ""Sometimes."" They are all really cool videos in themselves, but not as good (in my opinion) as the ones I reviewed in a little bit more depth above.

The extra features on the DVD are also A+ in their content. You expect something extra when you buy a music DVD, but not this much! When you play the DVD and come to the main title menu, you can either watch the videos in their original format, or click the Alternative View button, which shifts angle and lets you watch 10 of the 20 videos in expanded functionality. The highlights include the different view of ""Baby One More Time,"" the goofing around on the set of ""Stronger,"" the karaoke version of ""Toxic,"" the unseen clips of the ""Outrageous"" video where Britney injured her knee, and the acapella version of ""I'm A Slave 4 U."" All in all, I would say that this is not just an essential DVD for die-hard Britney fans, but an essential one for media students studying the art of the music video and for those who just want a perfect look at Britney's video career. It runs for a staggering 160 minutes! That's nearly three hours! Plus, the poster that comes free with it is really cool too. Buy this now!",1102550400,10,5608,4.624497991967871
2165805,4,B00064AM62,"In the review of her greatest hits cd, I said it was too soon for her to come out with such a retrospective, but with the videos, now is the perfect time for it.  I think Britney Spears is one of the best video artists around.  She knows how to captivate a viewing audience with dazzling images, spectacular dance moves, and a sensible story line.  Plus, it doesn't hurt that she is great to look at.  She stands higher than her peers (Christina Aguilera, Hillary Duff, Avril Lavigne, and other pop princess wannabes).  I would even go so far as to say that many of Spears best videos are even better than a lot of Madonna's videos, and that's no small feat.

My personal favorite video is ""Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" because I like the scenes she uses...from Arizona, I think.  She also has clips from her film, which wasn't bad either.  I also love her sense of irony on ""Oops...I Did it Again"" and the outfit she wears and her dance moves in that one.  In fact, all the videos from her first two albums are spectacular, from her attention grabbing schoolgirl uniform in ""Baby, one more time..."", the waitress with the funky glasses in ""Crazy"", the angelic looking, pierside dancing of ""Sometimes"", and the others.  Best of all, I love her ironic look at fame in the videos ""Lucky"" and ""Everytime"", both videos suggest there is something deeper to Britney than she has shown thus far (with her focus on sexual titillation to grab our attention).  I really like how Britney plays two roles in ""Lucky""--one as the spoiled actress who is deeply lonely though she puts on the act everyone expects of her; and the casual observer who seems to empathize with much compassion.  Britney can emote with her facial expressions very well (like when she pushes her handlers away in ""Lucky"" or when she's playing a teasing vixen in ""Oops...I Did It Again""), and I actually thought she did a good acting job in her film ""Crossroads"".  That's one area where she can one-up Madonna anytime.

The videos I don't like are her more recent ones from the last two albums (except ""Everytime"" and ""I'm Not A Girl..."").  The songs are annoying noise rather than actual music, and the videos are so in your face raunchy that it seems like she's degrading herself for the sake of getting our attention.  She should stick to the interesting story lines and dance moves.  Her collaboration with Madonna was a colossal waste of time.  The song doesn't make sense, isn't really catchy, and the video just an excuse to put the two icons together.  The one thing I'll never understand is why Britney never released ""Anticipating"" as a single and video.  That is the most catchy pop song I've ever heard and I love it.  I can listen to it over and over without getting tired of it and I can even envision what the video would look like.  Instead, she went wild with ""I'm A Slave 4 U"", which I hate the tune and lyrics of, not to mention video.

I do own this DVD collection because I love her videos from her first two albums and ""I'm Not A Girl..."" and ""Everytime"".  She has proven herself to be quite savvy and towers over her music charting peers.  No one of her generation comes close to making eyecatching music videos or looks as good as she does, so for that reason, this dvd collection is a welcome addition to any fan of music videos.",1102377600,,3314,4.492487479131887
2165806,5,B00064AM62,"Britney Spears has reigned the top 40 charts since her ubiquitous Grammy-nominated single ""...Baby One More Time"" hit radio in 1998.  She's hot, a great dancer and can really choose some awesome material (listen to any of the songs on this DVD and I bet you know most of them - what other artist has had such a huge impact?).  Ok, I admit it: the girl's voice isn't that great but she's unique and different sounding enough to her recognizable enough in the music business.  Every song on this DVD has been at least a Top 5 chart-topper (pretty impressive, no?) and these videos are HOT, HOT, HOT!  From her innocence as a teen queen as seen in ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" to a hard-rockin' mamacita in ""My Prerogative"" and ""Toxic,"" Miss Spears has made a huge impact on the music industry whether you agree or not.  An awesome DVD through and through, Brit!",1102118400,3,867,4.496815286624204
2165807,1,B00064AM62,"Wow, I can't believe there have been 5 star ratings for Britney on here.  Now, I'm not going to 'bash' her but explain a few truths to the last comment that Britney is 'still as successful' as she was when her 1st, 2nd or 3rd album came out. Britney is doing very, very bad, boys and girls. But she doesn't want you to know.

Has someone forgot the horrible single 'Me Against the Music'? It didn't even chart the US billboard. And the reason? It's horrible crap.  Has someone listened to the new single on her ""Greatest Hits""? The single ""I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)"" sounds exactly like No Doubt's ""Hella Good"" but with more whistles and bells to camouflage the fact that is as unoriginal and boring as Britney.  ""Hella Good"" was an awesome song but a few years ago, and when it was `original'. And the two `new' songs on ""My Prerogative"" are also unoriginal and horrible as Britney in a new tight halter top.

As far as sales go, ""In The Zone"" is a failure. 3 million copies is horrible! Sarah McLaughan from my hometown of Vancouver has sold more than 3 million copies of her new album in less time and without as much press as Britney. Sarah only has a market in North America; whereas, Britney has the world at her overpainted nails. When Britney has a 'tv premiere' to promote her new album, just like Michael Jackson did a long time, you have to wonder how bad the album is. And Britney's albums are progressively getting worse like mold growing on cheese.

Now, fine Britney had a few #1's in the UK but I hate to say, British like horrible pop music. Westlife anyone? Boyzone? S Club 7 or Juniors? (Ok, I'm getting ill).

Now, Britney is good drinking music (meaning you have be very drunk to enjoy it) and I respect Britney for releasing (with big-name producers' and writers' help) previous `fun time' music. But as I realized many years ago, her sound hasn't changed one bit. Once a pop tart, always a pop tart.

Really, Britney, you're a [...]. Yes, I lied about not bashing her. Get someone to re-invent your image and music because it is very tiresome.(But if you do, come out with anything 'decent', I will be a happy.",1102032000,9,2139,4.452685421994885

The DVD case is amazing, in silver digipack, with a folded poster of Britney inside.

The DVD menu is cool, though it is hard to handle. I must confess it took me some time to figure it out, but it is very

functional as well. At first, you see all Britney videos in a timeline, separated by her albums (like eras).

The ""alternate versions"" of the videos are great and I keep on watching them all the time. Just select ""alt.version"" and the screen rotates, so that you can access the extra material.

As a huge fan of Mrs. Britney Spears, it is amazing to have an opportunity to go back in time and see an innocent Britney, lost in ""...Baby one more time"", singing on the school corridor or outside the school with the dancers, in uncut versions of the original video.

I absolutely love the accapella version of ""I'm a slave 4 U"". The karaoke version of ""Toxic"" is outstanding, with Britney's body covered with diamonds, performing in front of the camera. It's also touching the alternate version of ""Everytime"".

The DVD audio quality is good, except for ""stronger"" which is encoded in a very, very poor quality! I don't know why they did that.

Anyway, being a fan or not, this video collection is a must-have item.

2165811,5,B00064AM62,"Over the years, Britney Spears has released several DVDs, most containing just a small, small portion of her video collections, finally this set brings her entire video catalog to one disc, with more than you could ask for!

The first portion of the DVD Contains all of her music video's in original form, uncut, in descending order in terms of age (Newest to oldest).

The video's on this section include (As well as a brief description and person rating of the videos):

1) My Prerogative (Which features Britney Spears at a party, other than that it is hard to describe though, I'd give this about a 4/5)

2) Outrageous (Which features Britney and Snoop dogg playing basketball, This video runs for roughly 1 minute (I'd rate this a 2.5/5, I just didn't care for it))

3) Everytime (Which has Britney spears and dealing with the problems of fame, never being able to go anywhere without being attacked by a mob of paparazzi, 4.5/5)

4) Toxic (A real fun video of britney traveling through various locations in a bright flashy Charlies Angels style, this is probably my favorite video, 5/5)

5) Me against the Music (Madonna and Britney performing throughout a club, 4/5)

6) Boys (Britney singing and performing in a tropical island/castle paradise, 4/5)

7) I love rock N roll (a flashy grunge style video of britney performing this cover song, 4/5)

8) Not a girl, not yet a woman (Britney performing on a desert cliff, a slower paced video compared to her others, 3.5/5)

9) Overprotected (another flashy, 'fun' video of britney and her friends traveling through a hotel and a night on the town, 4.5/5)

10) overprotected - international version (a solo video of her performing in various locations, not as entertaining as the other version, 4/5)

11) Slave 4 u (Britney and others performing in a hot steam-room club, 4/5)

12) Dont let me be the last to know (Britney on an island spending time with a guy, another slower-paced video of hers, 3.5/5)

13) Stronger (A darker video of her performing in a room with quite a few special effects going on around her, 5/5)

14) Lucky (Britney spears telling a story about the luckiest girl, A nice colorful video, 4/5)

15) Oops I did it again (Britney on Mars singing to a spaceman, 4.5/5)

16) from the bottom of my broken heart (Britney spears by her house and in a field, another slow-paced song and video, 3/5)

17) Born to make you happy (Another solo video of britney performing in colorful rooms, 4/5)

18) Crazy (Britney and Melissa Joan Hart performing as 50's waitresses in a futuristic bright setting, 5/5)

19) Sometimes (ANOTHER slower paced video of britney on the beach (Is anyone noticing a trend here? ;) , 3.5/5)

20) Baby one more time (Britney as a catholic school girl in.. a school! performing, 5/5)

Overall, I'd say Baby one more Time, Crazy, Stronger, Oops, Overprotected, and Toxic are by far my favorite videos, and this collection would be worth it for them alone.

Onto the next section of the DVD, the Alternate video footage.

1) My Prerogative (This video lets you view the short video clips and digital images taken in the actual video)

2) Outrageous (Outtakes of Snoop Dogg and Britney on the set of the video)

3) Everytime (an alternate angle of britney spears (The whole video is her in a white outfi singing to the camera)

4) Toxic (Karaoke version - Britney spears in her 'nude' suit (only wearing the glitter from the toxic video) performing Toxic in front of a green screen. The instrumental version of the song plays while strategically placed lyrics cover britney spears so you can sing along)

5) Slave 4 U (3 alternate angles to the video, including an acapella (no music) version)

6) Dont let me be the last to know (Outtakes and additional footage, invluding a big collage of her videos put together which is real interesting)

7) Stronger (Outtakes)

8) Oops I did it again (Uncut version)

9) Crazy (Remix video)

10) Baby one more time (Uncut version)

The video's themselves look great, and the sound is as well. Unfortunately though, the sound is just Stereo (And not digital sound), for music video's its not a big deal though.

Overall, it's got hours of footage on the disc itself.

The disc comes in a 3-fold Cardboard case with Britney on the front (With a shiny foil background and embossed design), the track listing on the back, and a 3rd side with images of all her albums/singles.

The inside of it contains a slot on the left to hold the booklet (also a 3-fold, double sided one, with 2 of the panels showing a collage of pictures and memorabilia of her, the 3rd panel having another track-listing. The back of the 3-fold booklet is a poster of her (Same as the cover).

Back to the case, the center panel of it features a black and white picture of britney (On the same reflective material) with a disc holder in the center.

Finally, the right section is another black and white picture of her, on the silver foil, which has her singing.

Overall, even for a 'casual fan' like myself who has never bought her CDs but has enjoyed her videos, this is a great collection and for a lot price. I highly recommend it.",1101600000,,5132,4.65149833518313

Its a cool dvd, she looks hot in all of the videos, but that's not the only reason I got it, its a really cool item, if you've seen most of her videos allready, it won't be as exating, or who knows maybe it will, just go and buy it!",1101427200,,555,3.8

Also, there are alternate videos that include outtakes, rough cuts, karaoke, alternate angles, acapella, and several other features to choose from. Overall, this DVD ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Britney Spears is an amazing artist and performer and there is no one today who can surpass her when it comes to fame. She is one of a kind and there is no one like her.

2165818,5,B00064AM62,"Well, I'm just writing from my job. I have received my dvd a couple of days ago, not personally, someone else got it for me and the first impression I had was a sonorous wowww !!! for the really really nice platimun cover (you gotta be careful because the fingertips easily can print on it) and inside you can find out a pull out picture of Britney with that black outfit, btw she looks terrific, so I  guess I won't be able to sleep for the next days :). Then, watching the dvd, the first thing I noticed was the cool menu, in diagonal way, just a little dizzy, but you can manage it easily after few tries. It has all her videos, they sound great considering they were recorded in 2.0 channels and the extras are definitely a ""must have"" for avery Brit big fan. This is my fourth purchase from Amazon, and I must congratulate them for its excellent service. Next thing I'll buy: The extended edition of Return of The King. So anxious to complete my LOTR collection.

2165820,5,B00064AM62,"Hola from Peru (South America);

I'm enjoying of our dear Britney Spears ""Greatest Hits"" DVD and I must say that I wasn't aware about its release until one week ago when I was watching on Yahoo! Launch some streaming videos (with the quality you have over internet) and the ad of her DVD pop in!

I run into Amazon.com and after a quick review of the contents and features on the collection without any hesitation I promptly performed my purchase with my credit card. That same day of its release on Nov. 9th! Seven days later I have Britney to sing for me any time that I want!

No more waiting for a ""Special"" on MTV or poor quality recordings from cable TV!

I might be one of the first ones to own this DVD here in Lima-Peru (South America) if not the first one!

Regular retail CDs and DVD stores in my city are going to got it in three weeks at the most (maybe) and probbably for the double that I paid here in Amazon (including S&H!)

I just wished that just like in Whitney Houston's DVD, an interactive Britney would greet me to her Smash Hits with a ""Hi Welcome to my DVD! Enjoy and have fun!"" looking to the camera and then herself proceeding to point at each song selection or wathsoever!

I still like the interactive menu but if the picture of the video you select would expand while approaching to you, then that would have been extraordinary!

Wouldn't that have been awesome!

One advice for those who are just about to receive it or buy it: Try to keep your finger tips extra super clean when you tear out the protective plastic of the box and touch the ""platinium"" cardboard case of the DVD! Otherwise you will find your finger prints all over the box!

Anyway I am very satisfied with Amazon service, since it was the first time I purchased something from them, it came quik in perfect condition and brand new packed! (It came along with another DVD I ordered too!)

Why is the sound of ""Stronger"" (My favorite song and video) so poor? It's the only one that doesn't sound as digitally clear and ""pristine"" as they say! And I own a 6.1 channels ""Kenwood"" Audio-Video Sound Receiver with DTS mode!

Since my first language isn't english I wish this DVD Collection hand't gave up the captions or subtitles option in english! They're superb for learning english while singing your favorite song!

Britney Spears' ""Live from Las Vegas"" DVD does have the captions and subtitles option!

I wish for Britney to come and visit Peru someday! She would love the archeological sites and the lost citadel of the Incas: Machu Picchu up in the Andes!

I would be her guide since I work for the Tourist Information here in Lima and I like to have friends from all over the world!

Looking forward to hear back from you all very soon also if you ever plan to come and visit Peru: The Proud Land of the Incas!

Kind Regards

2165821,5,B00064AM62,"I hear a lot of stories about this girl, most of them negative.  But now I think that most of those stories are used for publicity purposes to harm Britney.  I see the work she has done compiled rather nicely in this DVD presentation and I'm glad that the negative publicity hasn't harmed her sense of entertaining her audience.  I wasn't a big fan of Britney, I stopped listening to her after her second album.  But seeing the new DVD of hers in the store and the negative controversy surrounding her, I just had to get this DVD.  In my case the negative stories gave me the incentive to purchase this DVD at the same time helping her in the sale of this item.  The videos presented here are really good.  Her videos are all eye candy pieces.  Britney looks great, a very sexy girl doing some great dance choreography accompied by great CGI work in some of the videos.  The design of the DVD is pretty cool, though a little confusing to manuever around at first, but when you get the hang of it, it's not so bad.  The audio is great except for the last song "" . . . .Baby One More Time"".  The audio volume level drops a couple of notches.  Probably an overlooked problem when doing the final finishing touches on the DVD.  I liked the alternative versions of the songs.  During the playback of these, some of the videos become interactive which is cool.  The only minor problem is the looping back when following the written instructions when jumping to different parts of the video.  It seems that the video may never end when following the instructions to the letter.  In any case very entertaining and a very clean presentation, excluding most of the content which might be a little too sexy for some viewers.

Got to hand it to Britney and her team in making a great effort to please her fans.  DVD exterior packaging is cool too, very eye catching especially the rendering of Britney's photo on the cover.  Great graphic design work and package design.",1100649600,2,1958,4.477401129943503
2165822,5,B00064AM62,"I just have to say that i got my DVD today and it is
the best Greatest Hit's DVD ever it have's all of her
video's and some i have never seen before. I love the
video of(EVERYTIME) if you like Britney i would get this
DVD because you have not seen anything yet. Thank You.",1100476800,2,272,3.875
2165823,5,B00064AM62,"for the ""Toxic"" video, is there a way to watch the alternative version wtihout the lyrics covering up her chest?!",1100476800,3,113,4.7
2165824,5,B00064AM62,"First the bad then the good:

A: No surround sound mix.

B: There was no point whatsoever to put ""Outrageous"" (where she hurt her leg or something like that) on there because it's less than a minute long. She should have either reshot it for the video or put it in the ""Extras"". It just seemed silly to put a clip of a song on there, it just seems out of place.

C: I do think that this should've had the ""Britney Commentary"" option. With all the interviews she's done, it was lacking hearing her talk (although I'm sure some welcome it).

Now the good:

A: All the videos are memorable. Some rarely seen. Great guilty pleasure pop music that you either love her or hate her for.

B: It's in order, but works its way backwards.

C: The menu's pretty easy to navigate through. The key explains how to work your way around it.

D: There's a lot of alternates, going back to her first video.  ""Toxic"" is probably the one the guys want to check out, but the ""karaoke"" lyrics are, um, ""strategically placed"".  Lots of outtakes and behind the scenes footage (although strangely enough, no interviews), and it seemed like there were easter eggs in there as well. The DVD geeks will like it...

Pick it up. In my opinion of DVD music videos, it's an essential.",1100476800,4,1252,4.4
2165825,5,B00064AM62,"Many people have questioned the release of a ""Greatest Hits"" with only five years in the business. Britney herself has decided, at this point, to take two years off before she plans on returning to the music scene and reiventing herself. What ""Greatest Hits: My Prerogative"" does is show off Britney's greatest accomplishments. While the CD leaves you wanting more, this DVD satisfies you and captivates the audience.

  Many video collections leave something out and causes an uproar because fans wonder why their favorite video wasn't collected. This is not the case here. Every video Spears has done in her career, from ""Baby One More Time..."" through ""My Prerogative"" are included. Even a very short clip of the video ""Outrageous"" that was going to be released along with the movie Catwoman. Someone was very generous in including much more for the fan. There are a great number of videos that are included in the ""alternate"" menu. With this option, you have the chance to watch unedited versions of videos including ""Oops!... I Did it Again"" and ""Everytime."" There are many hidden surprises throughout the DVD, including an acapella ""Im A Slave 4 U"" with Britney singing too you, an alternate version of ""Toxic"" that includes the words and has Britney wearing nothing but her diamonds, and a very humrous ""Don't Let me be the Last to Know"" that takes you on a trip through her vidoes, looking at some of the leading men.

  Another thing to gush over is the fact that the international videos have been included. There's the album version of ""Overprotected"" that was shown overseas in Europe. There's also the remixed version as shown in the United States. ""Born to Make You Happy"" also has been included and ""I Love Rock and Roll"" is here. There are many more clips and intimate moments hidden throughout the DVD and it is simply breathtaking and impressive. Even if you are not a fan of Britney's music, I think it would be hard to not marvel at her video work and performances.

  In some other review someone complained about the sound quality. It may not be 5.1 surround sound but it doesn't kill the DVD. It's nothing to complain over. The sound quality is great and the visual quality of the DVD is enhanced and looks better than ever. The DVD menu for me was a little hard to navigate at first but I really liked the presentation. The idea was to make the entire DVD like a time capsule- the videos progress from present to the first, ""Baby One More Time."" They are elso seperated into Britney eras. Different songs from each of the album periods play as you decide which one to go to or where you want to go.

  Packaging was also impressive. The booklet that came along with it was nice- a pullout poster of Britney with the video listing included printed on the back. There's also a montage of many pictures and items from Britney's music career, performances, and shows.

  If I had to make one complaint about the DVD it would be that with all the extra features that were included, a performance or two from perhaps one of the Video Music Awards- such as the big shocker with Madonna, or even the ""Satisfaction/Oops,"" or ""Slave"" could have been included. Also, there was a ""Megamix"" video that Spears released on her website and put alongside her ""My Prerogative"" video. I'd think they would have found a place for it on the DVD but it is also absent. For me though, these are the only things to complain about.

  I was expecting a good DVD but Spears delivered. If this is just the end of a part of her career, I look forward to see where she's willing to go in the future. Looking at this DVD, it was fun to see the ""Sometimes"" Britney after seeing her more haunting side as featured in ""Everytime."" It was fun seeing the ""Lucky"" Britney and then being able to see her take a personal stance and attack towards being famous in ""My Prerogative."" Of course, it was nice to see that racey side of her in ""Baby One More Time"" and then see her rather mature and scandelous side in modern day in the ""Outrageous"" clip.

  In all, this was one great DVD that exceeds expectations. There is no need to list the content really because every video she's done is here. The quality all around is impressive and definately worth your money, attention and would make a great gift to anyone looking for some good entertainment from the artist Britney Spears.",1100217600,86,4365,4.606451612903226
2165826,5,B00064AM62,"You gotta admit that her videos are entertaining, and many of them are so cheesy. Total fun! She's not a great singer, but she sure knows how to work it in front of a camera. All i can say is Britney should moonlight on the side as a stripper. She sure moves like one. I really enjoyed this dvd. The presentation is good: from the glossy packaging (that rediculous outfit she wears on the cover is a cross between marketing and cheese), to the cool and very impressive menu on the dvd. You get all of her music videos, plus alternate versions of some of the videos which have alternate camera angles . There are also outtakes for some of the videos. The video for My Perogative is probably the closeset you'll see to Britney being in a soft-core porno. Her version of My Perogative by Bobby Brown does nothing to improve the original version, but in a way i understand her choice because of the lyrics saying that it's her perogative to do what she wants. With all the crazy publicity and goings on, it's an appropriate title for her greatest hits package.  Love her or hate her, you cannot ignore her. I personally think that with the release of all her hits on one cd and dvd, that she needs to take a much-needed rest and break from the industry for awhile. I think she needs a career makeover and maybe for her next cd think of a more mature direction to her music. her last cd was horrible. Maybe get away from dance music for a bit and go into rock music. She needs to re-think herself and image and maybe tone it down a bit, and cover up more. Sex sells, but when a lot of the talent is absent and it's just the looks, then that can only go so far. I wish her all the best in the future, though.",1100217600,,1702,4.220858895705521

Did they modify the videos to be fullscreen and not in the original way the director wanted it to be? This is a huge disappointment.  I have waited so long for all of Britney's videos (in their original format) to be on DVD with 5.1 Surround Sound and Digital Enhancement.  I guess that dream will never come true...:( BMG is gonna hear about this...",1100131200,2,414,4.35064935064935
2165828,5,B00064AM62,"Wow! This is a GREAT DVD! I am glad that they tell you about the 'eggs' on the dvd, because even though some people are having a hard time getting to them, they know they are there when they can figure out how to get to them (I hope this made sense!) Some dvd's (like Duran Duran 'Greatest') are hard to find the eggs, especially for dvd novices!

Yes, the dvd may be confusing for some. It took me a while to figure out some things....

SOME BASICS TO KNOW:

-The 'key' symbol at the bottom of the screen gives you directions, choose that if you are confused first

-The 'Alt. View' lets you see the videos in different ways, once you click on it, it turns the screen around and gives you options for the videos (like watching outtakes from 'Oops.."" etc, or multi angles for different videos)

-Getting to the Karaoke and things like this...When you are in the ""Alt View"" prompts come up on the screen telling you to ""Enter"" and things like that.. you have to be quick, but if you do press enter when it tells you, you can watch the karaoke, or only a capella version of IAS4U or whatever it tells you!

I hope this helps (a little?)

Also, for those of you wondering, there is NOT a full clip of OUTRAGEOUS, it is only a few different scenes, but that is ok! I was hoping for the full video!

In general, I think this dvd is WELL WELL worth owning, one of the best greatest hits dvds I have. The 'spatial' design of the dvd is awesome. Imagine looking at a row of dominos spaced out diagonally from the bottom left to the top right hand side, and that is how the Britney videos are displayed on the screen before you choose one to watch (the little thumbnails of the clips move too!)

Super cool packaging, a bit confusing but overall a Britney fan MUST MUST have!",1100131200,2,1766,4.2477611940298505
2165829,5,B00064AM62,"I thought that this DVD was great with all of Britney's videos.  Finally, all of them on one DVD!  She is such a great artist.  I did have a lot of problems with the main menu.  I couldn't get to the overview or the key, dice, or clock in the bottom corner.  Apparently I am missing the bonus footage and alternate videos. I also didn't see the Karaoke section.  Anyone have any suggestions how to navigate and make it work?  My cursor didn't light up those items.

My only hang up was with the main menu.  I found it extremely hard to navigate from one video to another based upon the way they set up the menu.  I eventually gave up and just played the whole retrospective.  All of the videos are excellent...but TOXIC has to be the most energetic, and imaginitive, of Britney's career to date.

This collection moves from the most recent ""My Perogative"" all the way back to her first hit ""Baby One More Time"".  Each video looks incredible, and there are even alternate versions and hidden footage throughout to keep you entertained for hours.  The sound mix is a very strong stereo (oddly not 5.1 surround).  She's a pioneer in the visual medium, and this collection proves how very strong she is in the music video.

2165832,3,B00064AM62,"Yes, the videos are great, but why in the world did they not give this a 5.1 sound mix when her other DVDs had them and the In The Zone album even got a DVD-Audio release???  What a HUGE let-down!",1100044800,,196,3.9
2165833,5,B00064AM62,"Calling all you Britney fans... you must buy this dvd! Britney has entertained many, fans and foes alike, with her creative and interesting videos. Whether you like her or not, the public can't help but wonder what Miss Spears is up to in her new video. This DVD is a complete collection of all her music videos, including some interactive and alternative features. From the song that started it all, ""...Baby One More Time"" to the more recent smash hit ""My Prerogative"", it is not hard to see why Britney has mastered the art of music video performance. Creative and funky videos, such as ""Oops!...I Did it Again"" and the ever so popular ""Toxic"", contrast so well with sweet and innocent classics like ""Sometimes"" and ""Don't Let Me be the Last to Know"". The international version of ""Overprotected"", ""Born to Make you Happy"" and a few clips of ""Outrageous"" are an excellent addition to the DVD as they are fairly rare and the majority of fans have not seen them.

  The alternative and unreleased features are fun, interesting, and yes, somewhat bizarre. Exactly what is the astronaut from Oops doing in My Prerogative? But still, playing around with the camera angles and audio is a great way to see the videos in a new light. From hearing ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" acapella to viewing ""Everytime"" in a whole new way, the alternative mode allows a lot of depth into Britney's videos and Britney herself. The bloopers are super fun as you get to see Britney make some pretty wacky faces. And I am sure men everywhere just can't get enough of the karaoke version of ""Toxic"" in which Brit appears in nothing but those strategically placed diamonds.

I have been a huge Britney fan since she started and I am so glad she released this complete compilation of all her videos. It is a great addition to any fan's collection. Don't forget to check out Britney's wicked greatest hits cd, My Prerogative.",1100044800,22,1889,4.663663663663663
2165834,1,B00064AM62,"Let me break it down:

1.) Britney ruined the Bobby Brown Rn'B classic 'My prerogative'.

2.) The only people that buy Britney's records are men who think she is 'hot'.

3.) As for the onyx tour, that was just a legal form of theft! Britney was performing all her songs in agent provocateur underwear!!!! Question for her fans: why didn't u guys just go a s---- club?!!

4.) Britney's publicity stunts are just pathetic + irresponsible- Dropping diet pills just when photographers are around (Britney does NOT TAKE THEM, THEY ARE DANGEROUS),JASON ALEXANDER wedding, not getting Kevin Federline 2 sign a pre-nup (that is BS! Even she could NOT be THAT DUMB- THAT MAN MAYBE FINE BUT HE WAS BROKE!!!!!!!), the Madonna kiss (gross!)......

5.) 'Lucky' is a idiotic song about a woman who has everything yet crys at night!? This lady is just straight up ungrateful. 'Lucky' would have had zero sales if Britney started covering up + gained 5 stone!

6.) a

2.) The new tracks on this C.D 'I've just begun having my fun' + Do somethin' are PAINFUL to listen to, trust me!",1099958400,3,1065,4.663101604278075

With that said, this DVD is awesome!  There's the classic old favs that you remember watching on TRL everyday (if you were a teenager with nothing better to do after school) as well as new ""edits"" of videos for some of the cooler songs.  While the DVD may seem excessive in conjunction with the release of the CD, they're both a lot of fun and will entertain any psychotic Britney fan (myself included) for quite some time.",1099958400,5,580,4.495238095238095
2165836,5,B00064AM62,"Imigine Pop Culture without Britney Spears? That would be one boring world. I just got my copy of the limited edition Hits album, and OH MY GOD! ITS A TOTAL MUST HAVE! Watching all the videos that Britney has made, made me realize how much Britney has contributed to the best music and entertainment of our lifetime. I give it 10 stars if I could. Purchasing it was to me, like saying thankyou to Britney for the hard work, the dedication, and the entertainment over the last 6 years. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE how all of her dreams have come true, and now we can reflect back on her success with the Immiculate Collection of our Generation, our very own IDOL-STATIS Figure like her idol Madonna! I would like to dedicate this to Britney Federline, and thank you for the years. Now take time to make a family, enjoy your life, and celebrate your wildest dreams unfolding! We will be ready for your return. Please don't make us wait too long. LOVE YA!",1099958400,8,945,4.5321637426900585

I give this a 10 for anyone to get inside the world of Britneys music and see why she is so HUGE all over she has made herself a household name a great business woman who knows how to work it and still be a down home girl!,1099872000,8,432,3.6559139784946235
2165838,5,B00064AM62,"It is about time that britney came out with her old stuff because her new stuff is not all that at all... britney is kind of losing it for me as a fan... she seems that she does not care anymore about her fans or her life for herself... but that is another story...

my favourite britney videos: ""opps... i did it again"", ""toxic"", ""..baby one more time"", and ""stronger""... these videos did it for me... they are great and each of them should have won awards... the only videos i hated were ""not a girl, not yet a woman"", 'everytime', 'me against the music' f/ madonna and 'sometimes'.

no wonder the girl is up to par in videos with michael jackson, madonna, janet, mariah, and U2... she has the best directors and it seems that each song goes with the video (especially ""toxic"")... im excited to see the version with just her in the sparkles (wink wink if you know what i mean)

if you are a brit fan and love her ""old"" videos then get this DVD and you will watch for years to come...

2165839,5,B00064AM62,"No, it's not too early to release a greatest hit's dvd and cd.  She has four albums out with tons of great hits.  This DVD has every video Britney has ever made.  Even the ones not in America such has ""Born to Make you Happy,"" and ""I love Rock n' Roll,"" and ""Overprotected Cd Version.""  It includes alternate footage of the videos never seen before, which I got to get a sneak peek of ""Everytime,"" which is good.  There is Alternate Audio with it also.  I'm looking forward to this great dvd.  I was hoping she would release something like this.  The cover is kind of weird though.  I agree with that.  Oh well, it's just a different Britney we haven't seen.  I can't wait until she comes back with new music with a different style.  Let's get this cd and DVd to number one.  She deserves it.  She went through so much, with hate and love.  THis will be her last cd and DVd for a long time.  She might not come back for four years or so.  Wish Britney luck with her new husband and her new life.",1099699200,9,995,4.152631578947369
2165840,5,B00064AM62,"I give this young woman 5 stars.  Only Houdini could have turned tricks of this caliber.

  However, anyone who has seen a photo of Britney from the last 12 months knows this cover picture is the work of a master quilter...  A real portrayal of the culmination of her career would be: A picture of her barefoot, flabby, disheveled, and drunk, standing in a gas station bathroom with a cigar hanging out of her mouth  (an EPT in one hand and a Redbull spiked with vodka in the other... )

  Makes us all wish we were so rich and classy.  Not mention the creative inspiration for halloween costumes she has fostered for several years.  I DO plan on buying this DVD.  It is much cheaper than going to a strip club.",1099699200,4,711,4.343511450381679
2165850,3,B00064AM62,"I'm sure the videos are fine, but who is she kidding with the packaging art!? She wishes she'll ever look that good. After her recent ""break"" I'm sure she'll look like an upright cow with bad acne. But the producers of her videos rock. Toxic is my favorite. I can't wait till I come out with a greatest hits album after just a small handful of albums.. or wait, this is only her fifth... great. Then I could photoshop a face from one photo and add it to the body of my oiled-up younger sister. Fun!",1099440000,3,498,4.197916666666667
2165851,5,B00064AM62,"Britney Spears has consistently amazed me with her ability to create video images that are so powerful that they become pop culture icons. The only artist on the market who gives Britney a run for her money is Madonna. Britney's videos range from being just fun and entertaining (like ""You Drive Me Crazy"" and ""Me Against the Music""), to sexy (""I'm a Slave 4 U,"" ""Toxic,"" and ""Baby One More Time""), to thought-provoking (""Everytime""). I look forward to owning this video collection and having a chance to view Britney's craft on a regular basis. Long live the queen!",1099440000,14,566,4.785714285714286

PLUS, half of the 20 videos (including Outrageous) have alternate versions or alternate endings! It is great! Some of the alternate versions are ""Outrageous"", ""Toxic"" (A version of Toxic with only the beads), ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", ""(You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop!

2165854,5,B00064AM62,"but the girl has definitely made an impact on pop culture. Is she a talented singer? No. Is she a talented performer? Maybe. Has she made some good music videos? Heck yeah. The songs are catchy to the ears *if you like pop music* and the videos are catchy to the eye whether we're talking about the clever Catholic school girl concept of ""Baby One More Time"", the sexy dance romp of ""Crazy"" or the sexy flight attendant of ""Toxic."" These videos are fun to watch and its nice to see all of them avaliable on DVD. It's nice to see ""Born To Make You Happy"" on the list since the USA didn't get that one. We got the equally pleasant ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" *which had a really sweet video to it....back when Brit was America's innocent lil teenage girl....oh how times have changed.*

Essential to Britney fans....although I cringe to think how many gross old men are going to buy this for their own reasons....LOL!",1098921600,10,924,4.435294117647059

2165856,1,B00064AM62,"First off, her version of 'my perogative' sounds really awful! She should have left it alone. Bobby Brown's version (the original, which I REALLY recommend- Don't Be Cruel) is what should be playing on the radio. Re-release his song and take hers off, i'm sure it would be a better hit! I have no idea what is up with the music video either. It's like she has ran out of ideas... she's done and shown so much already, what's left to do? I'm just curious how she'll get over this one.",1098748800,6,483,4.318681318681318

Now she's taking a break from her career, so all you britney fans out there like myself should buy the CD and DVD on the same day. Let's make Britney have 5 CDs hit #1 on the billboard charts.  I mean you have 20 videos some with extended footage, lots of bonus material, hours of new and old interviews and behind the scenes videos, concert footage (maybe).

Well, let me tell you. Even the ones you are familiar with with hold a few surprises. One of the discs' features is to watch ORIGINAL versions of each video and 'ALTERNATE' versions. How does a 'Toxic' video sound with Britney wearing nothing but the diamonds the entire video? Or her 'My Prerogative' video where the whole thing is the video playing in the original version where Britney rolls around on a bed? Also, there will be special cameos by people that were originally cut from the videos. And, there will be an 'Outrageous' video, even though it was never completed.

2165875,5,B00064AM62,"Britney is by far the most explosive, famous, successful, and don't forget, controversial video star of the past five years. Probably the past decade considering the boring fodder around in the 90s. Almost every single video exploded with popularity as they took it to the next level, pushing the envelope, and becoming more and more erotically artistic. From the teen-sexuality flaunted in ""...Baby One More Time"" and ""Oops! I Did It Again!"" to the graduated level of sensuality in ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" to the jewels(ONLY jewels)-clad stunning photography and direction of ""Toxic"" to the blatant, flat-out, straight-up, in your face raw sexuality that we have just seen in ""My Prerogative."" I'm not saying such exposure is healthy or good, but Britney is an entertainment genius, and whether you hate or love her, she always grabs your attention (and in most cases, entertains). And those are just the sexy controversial videos. Not mentioned is the Madonna-kiss-almost in ""Me Against The Music"", the love-making on the beach in ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", and the controversial ""death and life"" scenes from ""Everytime"". Aside from these controversy-hugging videos, there are the solid, entertaining (and often underrated) other videos of Britney's career, including ""You Drive Me Crazy"", ""Lucky"", the beautiful ""I'm Not A Girl..."", and the hip, mature style of ""Boys"". In conclusion, Britney is the greatest video star of recent years because she has never dissapointed and has presented something new that no one can help watching and talking about. This long-awaited collection of hits, a testament to how successful she is, with over 15 hit videos in only 5 years, is a must-have for any level of Britney fans.",1097625600,14,1720,5.102836879432624
