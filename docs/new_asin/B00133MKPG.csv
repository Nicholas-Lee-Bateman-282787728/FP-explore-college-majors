8248971,5,B00133MKPG,"It's too bad the previous reviewer tossed his copy.  I found the vintage film footage from WWII to be fascinating.  I'm amazed that such film footage was taken during these horrific battles, and that it survived.  Yes the footage is a bit grainy and the vidiographer's hand jerked a few times.....no doubt while jumping in a hole.  Remember, some of this footage was taken 70 years ago....and filming techniques and equipment have progressed.

All of the film footage included on the DVDs was taken by the U.S. Military.  There is a short film on Marine boot camp from the 60's, focusing on those caring and loving drill instuctors nuturing the young lads through boot camp.  I think this was added for comic relief.  But the rest of the footage is vintage war footage and commentary.

Disc 1 includes footage from Guam, Midway, Battle of Bougainville, Rabual, Tarawa, Saipan, Battle for Airfields, Pelileu, and Iwo Jima

Disc 2 includes footage from Okinawa, Korea, Moments between Battles, Inchon Landing, Manchurian Border, Pusan Perimeter Battles, Obong Ni Ridge, Helicopters in Korea and Korean War Summary.

Disc 3 includes footage from This is Parris Island, Builder of a Few Good Men, Marines 66: A Day in Vietnam, Full Blade: The Battle and Contact Ambush.

For the price, you get 10 hours of vintage war videos and the bootcamp video.  Perhaps a more accurate name for this 3 Disc DVD set would have been 'Historical Film Footage of the Marine Corps in Bootcamp and Battle,"" but that is a bit long.  Buy it.....you won't be disappointed.",1273017600,,1547,4.8773946360153255
8248972,1,B00133MKPG,"I purchased this for my father, a retired Marine from WWII and Korea.  It is mostly old military films starting at Guadalcanal, through Korea, and I think some from the Gulf War - we never finished it.  There are several films about boot camp, basically all the same.  The narration is difficult to understand, and there is no closed captioning.  There is no history at all.  I recommend the History Channel for DVDs. I'm never disappointed with them, especially The Pageantry of the Corps.  I wish I could return this item.",1222732800,7,524,4.7032967032967035
