5019543,4,B006U49SC6,"What the hell happened to American horror? Remember when mainstream horror films actually offered either originality or creativity in the way victims died? Now we're practically spoon fed the same formula over and over and it doesn't help that more than half of the horror films getting the green light or being released in theaters are a remake of a film you love. The 70s, 80s, 90s, and even early 00s in some cases were a fantastic time for horror that seem to have gone the way of the dodo bird. The horror genre is no stranger to the anthology formula, but there's something about The Theatre Bizarre that manages to capture the atmosphere of certain horror films you know and love.

Tales From the Crypt, Dead of Night, Creepshow, Trick 'r Treat, and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie are a few films The Theatre Bizarre will either remind you of and/or it pays homage to. To bridge the story together, a woman is drawn to the worn down looking theater next door. Once inside, she's treated to a show hosted by a man acting like a living wind-up toy (played by Udo Kier). Just the framing segments alone are extremely creepy. The make-up, the way the people on stage move, and the way eyes are painted on the top of their eyelids. It's a bit unsettling in the best of ways. There are six stories in the film's nearly two hour runtime:

""The Mother of Toads"" is one of the weakest. A couple takes a vacation in France basically in the middle of nowhere. While they're browsing shops, they meet an elderly woman who draws the man, Martin (Shane Woodward) into her home with The Necronomicon. The tea she gives him puts him under her spell and all hell breaks loose from there. This is probably a lot like the movie Frogs. The multi-colored toad vision is pretty lame. The best scene comes at the beginning where Martin and his girlfriend Karina (Victoria Maurette) are driving through the countryside. The shot obviously pays tribute to the opening of The Shining. I was left with what felt like the punch line to a really bad joke at the end of the story. ""Don't you hate it when you get really drunk and you wake up next to a giant multi-titted toad?""

""I Love You"" is the other fairly timid story and the one that features the stiffest acting. A man wakes up in his bathroom with blood everywhere. He calls his therapist, who's with his wife that he hasn't been able to get a hold of for days. She comes home only to tell him that she's leaving him. ""I Love You"" is basically an R-rated drama until the last two minutes where everything is turned upside down. The scenes that stick out the most are the ones of Andre Hennicke unconscious in his bathroom. Everything is white; the floor, the walls, his clothes. The only color in the scene is from his blood. It's not bad, deserves some credit for a solid buildup to its climax, and is at least a bit more threatening than toads.

""Wet Dreams"" directed by and co-starring the legendary Tom Savini is up next. A man has very vivid dreams that usually involve his wife castrating him and feeding his severed member to him during breakfast. It's a pretty decent stab at a mind-bending horror story. It's no Inception, but it doesn't really have the opportunity to be and in the end has no reason to be as in depth as that as its story progression is just fine.

""The Accident"" is another slow burning story. You can pretty much guess what it's about from the title. The way the deer acts is horrific enough, but what sells the entire story is the haunting music and the facial expression of the biker. The little girl asks some questions about death, which her mom gives really stupid answers to (seriously, a good zombie?).

""Vision Strains"" is easily the most original and creative story of the film. A woman targets homeless women and addicts and kills them. In their last breaths and as their life flashes before their eyes, the woman injects their eye fluid into her own and basically experiences their life story. She writes it all down in an attempt to learn everything the world has to offer. A serial killer with purpose is something that doesn't come along very often.

""Sweet Dreams"" rounds out the set. This one was a bit hard to watch. There are some really disturbing fetishes going on with this one all involving gluttony, sweets, and overeating. It's downright disgusting at times and it has the goriest ending of the bunch. It puts a pretty interesting twist on The Last Supper, as well.

It's not that The Theatre Bizarre isn't flawed. Like most horror movies, there's plenty of bad to go along with the good as it suffers from weak writing with actors in certain stories that don't have that natural flow that the rest of the cast does. One could also argue that only half of the movie really leaves a long-lasting impression. To be honest though, there were bits and pieces of every story that spoke to the horror fan in me in ways I haven't felt in years. Like a classic horror film, it's like you have to sit through some lameness to delve into the greatness buried deep within its core. Nauseating, phantasmagorical, and discomforting, The Theatre Bizarre is pure, gory, blood-soaked madness at its finest that will give horror fans the feeling of being a kid locked in a candy store for two blissful hours.",1328140800,47,5284,4.543067226890757

5019558,4,B006U49SC6,"This little known horror anthology could be considered a hidden gem. There's lots of dark energy and creativity here. This is definitely not for average horror fans however, it's an acquired taste and for those who enjoy extreme and non mainstream horror. It does remain one of the better more recent horror anthologies but is still a mixed bag.

Wrap around segment- by far the best anthology wraps round segment I've seen. To an extent, it's worth watching just for this. It doesn't seem like much plot wise but it's incredibly atmospheric, dark, and creepy about a girl who is enamored with an old theater based after the famous ""Theatre Guignol"". Fantastic imagery here and really sets the tone.

The mother of toads- This segment was just okay. It wasn't ""bad"" but wasn't particularly original or inventive, overall a good start for the anthology.

""I love you""- a somewhat depressing and cold segment about a break up that takes a nasty turn. A solid addition.

Wet Dreams- As one would expect from Tom Savini this segment is very graphic and very very bizarre. The first really extreme segment of this anthology and it doesn't hold back. Sexually explicit and gory. An interesting story line.

The Accident- By far the best of the bunch and a real turn from previous segments. A very melancholy and beautiful segment about death and dying. It has almost a peaceful and serene atmosphere that's comforting in it's approach. Amazing cinematography. I guess this shows taking a risk can pay off. Even if you don't like horror I highly recommend you check out this segment.

Vision stains- This segment is well done but is VERY difficult to watch. If you do not like needles AVOID. A very unique idea and probably the second best segment but the whole thing was cringe worthy. Extremely dark and sinister.

Sweets- This was truly bizarre and disgusting. I didn't feel like the plot wasn't the best and instead just focused on the gross out factor. Certainly ends with a bang.

As a whole the anthology has arthouse qualities and maintains a dark and deadly atmosphere throughout the entirety of it. Well worth a watch if you're a horror anthology fan and you're up for the content.",1449360000,4,2184,4.789893617021277

5019571,5,B006U49SC6,"The horror anthology, much maligned and for good reason but shown here the way it ALWAYS OUGHT TO BE!! A spiral-staircase descent into hell...in this case, a hell dominated by strong women. We are given five stories framed by the induction of a spectral innocent girl into the Theatre Bizarre.
In story one we get a powerful witch hag who turns herself young and naked and glistening in glitter slime and turns a spa-going girlfriend into the MOTHER OF TOADS!
And then the second story a Borges labyrinth of escaping from dreams within dreams within dreams, most of which climax in graphic castration.
Then there's this almost sweet interlude called The Accident where a mother talks to her daughter about death.
Then a story of a woman who goes around with tiny syringes, drawing up the ""vision stains"" of women who want to die, injecting the memories directly into her eyeballs. She asserts she has no interest in the all-too-predictable stories of men.
And finally the story of the ultimate co-dependent who is so clingy he gets himself decapitated and feasted upon by a gang of Hollywood litist types probably voted for Barack Obama.
And oddly, after all these powerful women, last image is the male impresario locking the innocent theater goer, now wearing a tragic broken doll mask, into a steamer trunk. Go figure. Victimization after all!

Anyway, this was one of the best horror anthologies I've seen in recent years even though a few of the shorts bog down the rhythm of the movie. The best of them is Vision Stains and was definitely the best of the bunch and worth watching. I Love You and Sweet Dreams have the most annoying male leads of the movie. They both beg their partner not to abandon them but Sweet Dreams is better than I love you. Mother of Toads was fun and Wet Dreams was hilarious. The Accident is arguably the most forgettable of the shorts and brings the film to a crawl. Even though some of the films in this anthology are boring or feature annoying characters the film as a whole should please any horror fan.",1361664000,,839,4.3164556962025316

Each short seemed to get darker, stranger and more entertaining as it went along. I liked the off the wall theater the youg viewer was in that introduced each short film. The clown that popped out of the box was really freaky looking in a dark weird sort of way. Also, each film was unique and stood on its own not relaying on the other shorts. I think this film was just a cut above some of the other so-so dvds out right now. Will worth the cheap price I paid for it.",1361059200,,593,4.256637168141593

5019608,3,B006U49SC6,"As in any anthology, horror or otherwise, there are going to be some hits and some misses. With this outing I can't say anything really got me going, but there was nothing that I found out and out awful either.

Here's the scoop. A young lady walks into a theater inhabited by a bunch of automatons with Udo Kier playing the host. He has her watch a series of short films. After each, he becomes more human and her less so.

There are six tales here and I found all of them at least interesting. Some, like one where a woman tries to leave her obsessive, paranoid boyfriend, were really good. Most were directed well and the acting was generally good. One episode dealt with a mother and her young daughter seeing the aftermath of a motorcycle hitting a deer. The daughter has some questions about death that the mother does her best to answer. This is the least ""horror"" in the lot but it's a good episode nonetheless. The final episode ""Sweets"" is the weirdest of the bunch and I almost went into a diabetic coma watching it. This really made me queezy. That much sweet stuff, filth and gore is not something you want to watch while snacking.

Overall, this might be the best anthology I've seen. It might not change your life but it's worth the time invested to watch it.",1359158400,,1274,4.435897435897436

5019610,4,B006U49SC6,"4 Stars = Classic

Now here is a film (films) that lives up to it's name, ""The Theater Bizarre."" Whether this is a good thing, or a bad thing, is a matter of personal taste for depravity, gore, ugliness, sex, torture, death, addiction, sweets (yes, sweets!) & other assorted physical & mental goodies, or baddies, if you like.

This horror anthology of six pretty bizarre stories, from six different directors, is kind of like a anti ""Creepshow."" As a matter of fact, the first & most ordinary of the six stories is, ""The Mother of Toads,"" ( sounds like Argento) the only supernatural themed story, which is also the weakest of the six. The other five are horrors of the human kind, & are pretty out there, like David Lynch meets David Cronenberg, at their most surreal & ugly moments, hosted by Dario Argento. I'm not saying that these stories are as successful as those great director's movies, but given the small amount of time allotted for them, they make quite a monumental tribute to morbidity. They are ugly, they are disturbing, they are surreal, & they are actually quite mesmerizing in their own sick & twisted way. I suppose one could call this collection of oddities an extreme version of ""The Twilight Zone,"" but you'd never see this coming out of the 1950's television series, nor is it anywhere close to science fiction. There is a science here though, the science of attraction through repulsion.

I'll give this obscure little oddity four stars, not because it's something that everyone will love, but because it is a sincere, unflinching tribute to human ugliness. Something that most people know about, but pretend it's not there. The directors of these stories know it's all to real, as these six metaphors can attest to.",1357344000,,1742,4.780730897009967
5019611,4,B006U49SC6,"Why the 4 stars only? no subs, no close caption and while these stories are great the one I expected to be perfect left me disapointed. It's a nice buy though. I recommend it a lot.",1357084800,,181,4.055555555555555
5019612,2,B006U49SC6,Not that good of an anthology movie. Just kinda boring and the tales/stories that they have going on are just not all the interesting or fun to watch. I would say skip this one unless you just wanna drink some beers and chillout.,1356998400,,229,4.348837209302325
5019613,4,B006U49SC6,"Looking for a film that witches, murder, Lovecraftian vaginas, eyeball injections, the Necromonicon, and naked toad monsters?  Well, depending my interpretation of what I saw in the melee of short films here you may be in for all that and more...all be it in small doses.  These short films vary substantially in film, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.

A macabre-marionetted Udo Kier (Mother of Tears, Iron Sky) introduces the six unrelated stories of this anthology.  I have provided an brief overview of each short film along with some opinions.

The Mother of Toads--directed by Richard Stanley (Hardware, The Profane Exhibit)
Vacationing in France, an American couple encounter an old lady (Catriona MacCall; The Beyond, City of the Living Dead) selling Lovecraftian earrings who claims to possess the Necronomicon.  This clichd creepy old lady invites the boyfriend to her uber-occult home in the woods, transforms into a slimy yet hot naked witch (played by a porn star), date rapes him, and turns into a six-breasted toad monster that looks like The Creature from the Black Lagoon.  MY CALL:  I may have spoiled the story, but the wooden acting and blatantly random premise spoil the short film even more.  Though, I must admit I found it entertaining.  You find yourself asking questions like ""why would he go to her house?"", ""why would he stay in that creepy house when she CLEARLY fancies herself a witch?"", ""who would ever accept a drink from someone who owns a Necronomicon!?!"", and finally ""the Necronomicon is French!?!""  It's a TERRIBLE film but a REALLY good laugh.

I Love You--directed by Buddy Giovinazzo
Axle's life is falling apart.  He wakes up on the bathroom floor, has bruises and wounds he can't explain, he looks awful and his wife is leaving him for another man.  MY CALL:  Pretty much a couple Germans who sort of speak English fluently trying to act in English...just get American or British actors!!!  Making matters worse, this never felt like horror film until the very end, which features some handsome gore.

Wet Dreams--directed by Tom Savini (who did the make-up for loads of stuff)
Donnie has been having some troublingly graphic dreams of castration.  His wife, Carla (Debbie Rochon; Tromaville Scream Queen), is getting tired of it.  MY CALL: We get a few grins from lines like ""Lovecraftian vagina"" as well as some fine gore which allow us to forgive Tom Savini for forcing us to watch his stillborn attempts to act.  This was really just a shock piece.  But I enjoyed it for the mindless fun that it offered.

The Accident--directed by Douglas Buck (Sisters)
A mother and daughter come upon a fatal accident which provokes questions about death from the young girl.  MY CALL:  This is the only short in this anthology which attempts to send a real message.  Death is addressed gracefully, the acting was decent and the filming and music were done very well.  I have one complaint though:  zero horror.

Vision Stains--directed by Karim Hussain (Ascension)
A woman murders vagrants and ""extracts"" their final visions as their lives flash before their eyes...literally, with a syringe.  Then she injects the fluid into her own eyes so that she may experience them.  MY CALL: This was clearly the coolest of the short films.  The premise, while loaded with in your face nonsense/non-science, was interesting and the extraction and injection scenes were uniquely hard to watch--not for the feint.  No joke!

Sweets--directed by David Gregory (Plague Town)
Estelle breaks up with her boyfriend Greg in this colorful binge of a film.  MY CALL:  Stylistic, weird and obsessively indulgent, with an art house theater appeal, alternating disgusting and sensual imagery, and a powerful duality.  All in all, a little too strange and sociopathic even for my taste.  Watching this felt like being trapped in the mind of a psychopath; a never ending WTF moment that was equal parts insane and genius.

This was a REALLY interesting mix and should interest horror fans and indie film fans alike.  Some risky production was practiced in some and shockingly good writing emerges here and there.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, we just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.",1356998400,14,4543,4.891361256544503
5019614,2,B006U49SC6,Why cant every collection of horror shorts be like Romeros original Creepshow? The first short is excellent however its all down hill from there.,1355356800,,145,5.083333333333333
5019615,1,B006U49SC6,"The title is certainly appropos, that's for sure!  In the tradition of such films as TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS, TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE, etc. THE THEATRE BIZARRE is a collection of six stories that are truly strange.
Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by any of the tales.  THE MOTHER OF TOADS is sloppily filmed and incoherent.  I LOVE YOU has a twist ending, but is slow and monotonous in getting there.  WET DREAMS is almost effective but gets muddled by the end.  THE ACCIDENT is a misfit---it's not a horror tale and makes little sense.  VISION STAINS is just dull and SWEETS is just repulsive.
All in all, a waste of celluloid and time.",1352246400,4,642,4.6371681415929205
5019616,5,B006U49SC6,"OK compared to films with Hollywood budgets this is 3 stars type material. But personally I prefer the work of little known actors and directors doing their darnest, than the work produced by a big name who is just 'phoning it in'.

Theatre Bizarre is not a gore for gore sake titillater like Hostel, nor is it a freak fest like Cannibal Holocaust.  It is certainly something that is too disturbing for many a viewer, but the cover image should be warning enough.

It is far from a simple exploitation sado-pornogray flick. It is a grouping of several well told horror stories, some quite Lovecraftian, others simple Fraudian.  The different Directors and actors for each story makes this especially watchable as any weaknesses of any actor or director are not annoying, whilst all try (and mostly succeed) to get their own personal strengths onto the screen.

So often a Horror film has a half hour of good stuff surrounded by an hour of filler. In this collection each story could have been extended another 10 minutes or so without getting diluted. Instead we have closely edited and content rich films where ever minute of screen time is well used.",1350950400,,1152,4.768844221105527
5019617,5,B006U49SC6,"Upon reading the reviews of this on Amazon and then finally seeing it, I heartily agree with the very positive reviews, though oddly disagreeing with many of them. So here's what I liked about it (and a few minor detractions). I was afraid that this might be close to one of those utterly dreadful ""8 horror film collection"" deals you can find at any discount store for $5: you know, the ones filmed on someone's ""smart""phone starring their acquaintances that have no business ever being offered for sale to an unsuspecting public, the kind who's quality is so utterly terrible that they don't even appeal to FANS of the ""utterly terrible"".  This is not a film like that. It is professionally filmed, with real music, real actors, real direction, etc.  In most cases, the music is superb, and when not superb is at least not annoying(another thing I feared).  The acting is also superb for the most part, with the exception of some of the actors in ""Sweets"",""Vision Stains"" and ""Wet Dreams"", whose performances are at least adequate and not glaringly bad. There are many very wonderful exterior as well as interior shots throughout this, to appeal to almost any kind of film fan; these are not simple, one-set cheapo segments.  As for the quality of the stories, I appreciated them all, though some of them were more low-key than others.  Greatly appreciated the appearance of the still-beautiful(though in this role, in a very creepy way) Katarina MacColl (of genre classics such as ""The Beyond"" and ""City of the Living Dead"")in ""Mother of Toads"", as well as the always entertaining Udo Kier.  I must admit the wrap-around story, ""Theater Guignol"" could've been handled much more adeptly; it is very awkward and abrupt, and segues into each individual story could've been much smoother...though I have no great affection for the director, who did the rather annoying remake/""butchering"" of ""Wizard of Gore"" (and managed to utterly waste the tailor-made-for-the-role Crispin Glover). The scenery in ""Mother of Toads"" strongly reminded me of some of Argento's and Herzog's work...not much higher praise can be given! The rather crass subject matter of ""Wet Dreams"", directed by Tom Savini, should be no surprise to anyone familiar with Savini, though it does manage to be entertaining but in a less-than-sophisticated way.  For ""sophistication"", see""The Accident"", or even ""I Love You""(which in some ways brought back nostalgia for ""Daughters of Darkness"", anyone famliar with that will know why).  I was quite unsettled by ""Sweets"", due to many disgusting scenes of humans eating and other slovenliness, but the ending was VERY satisfying...this reminded me of a ""Tales From The Crypt"" episode, though not any in particular. ""Vision Stains"" has some excellently depressing footage of the lowest of human city dwellers and their surroundings, is quite novel, but just didn't do much for me. Oddly, the ""relationship""storyline of ""I Love You"" coincides with ""Sweets"", which I found to be an peculiar choice, but handled very differently from each other. Yes, of course, almost any horror (or any other kind) movie has its flaws, but this anthology really satisfies. Violence and nudity are all here, but also quality and innovation are here.  I can't say that much of this really ""disturbed"" me as it did other viewer reviewers, but as a long-time Horror afficianado I can say this really made me happy. My only warning: if you are baffled by more cerebral films this may contain material you'll find objectionable. But if you don't mind a bit of art thrown in with your HORROR, don't hesitate to buy this!",1347753600,8,3604,5.013377926421405
5019618,1,B006U49SC6,"Unfortunately, I found the stories too disturbing for me.  Very bloody, sadistic, degrading, and violent.

5019620,4,B006U49SC6,"Like any compilation, there will be some stinkers as well as gems. Thankfully, even the ""crappy"" installments in this movie aren't all that bad.

The biggest offender to me was ""I Love You"", which suffered from poor acting and was pretty boring for the most part. As a previous reviewer pointed out however, it was rather visually stunning and the ending was a hell of a kicker, so overall, not bad but certainly not the best one. Likewise with ""The Mother of Toads"", in my opinion. It definitely conjured up a very Lovecraftian feel, but could have been better. That old lady's voice was so over-the-top, it was more funny than scary.

I personally loved ""Wet Dreams"" which featured Tom Savini. Definitely some very good gore scenes in that one, and made me hungry for sausage and eggs. :-P ""Vision Stains"" also had some well done, cringe-worthy gore. Seriously, if you are into that whole ""eye scream"" trope, you will love it. ""The Accident"" was very powerful and memorable, and differed from the other installments in that it was horror in the more mundane, everyday sense. ""Sweets"", the final installment, was my second favorite after ""Wet Dreams."" It featured what has to be the most grotesque scenes of eating since the feast scene in Fellini Satyricon. Oh, and I shant forget the creepy-as-hell, full-size puppets interspersed throughout the film. *shudder* They've got nothing on Chucky, that's for sure.

Another aspect of this movie that I'd like to sing the praises of: the music. The music was well-suited to each installment, beautiful and atmospheric.

So all-in-all, a very good anthology for the true horror aficionado. Definitely on par with Trick 'r Trick in terms of quality!",1344038400,2,1694,4.933333333333334
