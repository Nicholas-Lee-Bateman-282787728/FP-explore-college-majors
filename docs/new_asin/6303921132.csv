7855700,5,6303921132,"Moonlight Madness:  On the night of the full moon, Aladdin is caught between his promise to spend the night alone with Jasmine, and his desire to help his friends uncover a mysterious treasure that only appears during the full moon.  This is a good episode.  Not the best, but good enough to watch several more times.  And lay off the kid.  That transformation was fairly creepy.  B

Some Enchanted Genie:  Genie falls in love with Eden, the lovely Genie of the Bottle.  Remember back in my Macron 1 Fighting for Truth & Justice review when I said one-shot love interests in the Disney Afternoon rocked?  This is a shining example.  Eden is the perfect match for Genie.  Oh, & Abis Mal is hilarious as always.  Eden returned for a second episode (The Book of Khartoum), but it wasn't released to VHS for a reason: it's nowhere near as good as this one.  But still, we'll always have this one to enjoy, & it's one of the very best.  A+

Overall another must buy tape simply for Some Enchanted Genie.  Really, they could've paired any other episode with it, even the worst one & this tape would still get at least 4 stars, but since it's a good one I give it 5.",1365465600,,1159,4.3915094339622645

I hope that you don't think magic is too scary for your child. my child my not be exactly like yours but when she is scared or sad she wants me to put in a princess collection video and it makes her feel better with all their song and morals that make you feel good inside. i think that just incase your child is scared easily that you should wait till they are 5. Cause usaully 5 yearolds are not scared as easily as 2,3,and 4 year olds.",1188777600,2,575,3.9655172413793105
