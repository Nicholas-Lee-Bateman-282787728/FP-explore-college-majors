8110394,1,B000EHT528,I was hoping for a nice DVD for learning shapes and numbers for my son and this does not fit the bill.  The DVD is of low quality.  It does not make any sense the way that the numbers and shapes are taught in this DVD.  I'll just stick to Brainy Baby and Rock 'N Learn Series to actually teach my toddler and keep his attention.  I did not even donate this to the library..to the trash it went.,1358121600,,394,3.949367088607595
