5055302,5,B007512RGM,When I opened the box my 18 month old couldn't stop pointing to it.  We played it the minute I got it opened.  He started dancing on the first note of the theme song.  I wish the DVD had more shows and songs!  He loves dancing to all the songs.,1364774400,,244,3.82
5055303,5,B007512RGM,"These are great, my daughter just loves to watch these before bed and they have such great lessons in there!",1363046400,,108,4.45
5055304,5,B007512RGM,My twins are in love with The Pajanimals I have to play it in the car just to go the store.,1361577600,,91,3.380952380952381
5055305,5,B007512RGM,"We are absolutely hooked on this program!  It has wonderful story lines as well as catchy songs that your little one will want to sing along with.  Great lessons for children, which is a nice bonus so that your children aren't just watching mindless programs.  This is a great program any time of day. However, it does have helpful tips from the pajanimals for children to help transition to bed.  Also, the show is upbeat enough to entertain your children, but not too wild to get them all wound up before bed.  It's an all around entertaining, wholesome, and helpful show that I believe most young children 2-6 will love!  =)",1360368000,2,627,4.603603603603603

Educational not only for children but also for parents on how to deal with everyday bedtime issues.",1359331200,,178,4.741935483870968
5055309,5,B007512RGM,I purchased two copies of this awesome dvd for my 1 year old.  She loves the Pajanimals and the songs that come with the DVD.  It has 5 episodes from season 2 and 5 popular songs.  This was a great purchase for the cost. I wish you could purchase all the shows in the season though.,1359072000,,282,4.0
5055310,5,B007512RGM,"I've been watching this show for months with my toddler and he's absolutely in love with these cute little puppets especially Squacky. As a parent you'll appreciate the amount of learning that comes out of each episode; it teaches children about dental hygiene, bathing, sharing and overcoming fears. Also there's wonderful lullabies and jingles that are super catchy! Can't wait for the new season to come out on DVD so that I can clear space on my DVR, these DVD's come in handy when the good ole DVR decides not to work.",1358899200,,523,4.695652173913044
5055311,5,B007512RGM,"My kids LOVED the ""Goodnight Pajanimals"" dvd and watched it a million times. We always wanted more, and NOW we have it! The DVD arrived yesterday afternoon and they watched it right away! The story lines are great- esp the one where they are fighting over who's favorite color is what. My kids do silly stuff like that all the time, so they could relate and (HOPEFULLY) learn from it.  AS well, the scene where Sweet Pea Sue and Cowbella fight is so perfect for my 6 year old daughter who comes how with stories about arguments she and her ""friends"" at school are having. This is a great DVD and wouldnt you know--my kids are watching it AGAIN- right now :) They ask for it by name. My three year old says ""pananimal"" ;) hehe",1358812800,7,725,4.330882352941177
5055312,5,B007512RGM,"Very cute night-time viewing for little ones. My kids still like to watch the favorite Pajaminals episodes. Can't go wrong with Jim Henson! It's great to have as their night-time routine when traveling. Everyone who watches it ""aww's"" over the cute characters. They address childhood problems in a unique fashion, and go to different ""lands"" to problem-solve. Once the problem is solved, they can rest, and so can my little ones.",1426204800,,429,5.056338028169014

5055318,4,B007512RGM,"I bought this DVD and a couple others of the pajanimals. My 2 yr old daughter loves them but I noticed she became bored with them then  I realized both DVDs have pretty much the same episodes on them ""Pajanimals playdate"" and ""Meet the pajanimals"".
