7346728,5,B012C86TMU,"Please Twins is a wonderful anime! It's the second story from the anime Please Teacher and watching Please Teacher before this will help out some. If you want to get all the jokes and charcthers. But Please Twins stands on it's own. It has a good story line, pretty animation, good cast, all around Please Twins is a delightful anime!",1178409600,,334,4.583333333333333
7346729,5,B012C86TMU,"This is the sequel to Please Teacher. The characters of the first series appear throughout this one in a supporting capacity... enough to remind you what universe you're in. Mizuho and Ichigo from the first series are the most prevalent of the first series characters in this installment. Ichigo actually steals the scenes every time she appears. She's much more lively (or demonic if you will) in Please Twins than she was in the Teacher series. She is constantly spying on people, taking photos, and video. She has a deadpan laugh that borders on sociopathic. Mizuho is more one dimensional and ditzy than she was in the Teacher series, but it makes sense as she tries to be a professional teacher to the kids.

Overall, Please Twins is a lot of fun, but pales in comparison to Please Teacher. Having seen Please Teacher is by NO means needed to enjoy Please Twins, but it is a nice bonus. The characters are interesting, but not overly complex and most of the situations are standard fare. It's a different type of story than Teacher was. Teacher was very much a love story and about trying to make a marriage work. Twins is much more about family and friends with undertones of love. It's still a love story, but you never really get the sense of a passionate love. Perhaps this is due in part to trying to keep the true identity of which one of the twin and which is the sister a secret till the end. However, by the end of the 2nd episode I felt it was pretty obvious which girl was going to be the sister and which the girlfriend. I'd recommend the series to anyone who likes stories of family and love (Love Hina, Tenchi, Ah My Goddess, etc.) Just don't expect it to be a simple rehash of Please Teacher.",1178064000,,1712,4.4696485623003195

7346731,5,B012C86TMU,"After the success of the impeccably put together ""Please Teacher!"" romantic anime series, it would have been very easy for these folks to simply produce another season of that show filled with the episodic, predictable predicaments relying on running gags that so many other anime series use.  But, the studio kept with the theme of ""Please Teacher!"" and continued moving forward, and ""Please Twins!"" is the result.  And although watching ""Teacher"" before this series will increase your enjoyment of it, it isn't really a necessity as this one stands on it's own two feet just fine.  Now, onto the plot: picking up a year and a half after the ending of ""Teacher"" we are introduced to our three twins in question.  You read that right: three twins.  Self-made man Maiku, fiery Miina, and demure Karen all show up at the same house with the same childhood photo showing them and their only sibling, the same eye color, and the same story of childhood abandonment.  That is to say that one of the girls is Maiku's twin sister, and the other is not.  The question quickly becomes which is which?  The plot thickens when both girls fall in love with their possible brother.  Icky?  Yeah, but any anime veteran knows that this kind of implied incest is pretty much par for the course in this genre.  Plus, it's comic gold.  That is, if you have kind of a sick sense of humor. (ahem) Needless to say, this show opts to push the bounds far past the levels of inappropriateness that ""Teacher"" went to.  This turns out to be a good thing as the humor in ""Twins"" is raucous and thoroughly enjoyable throughout.  My favorite episode, for example, focuses on rumors that Maiku is in a homosexual relationship with a fellow student, so the girls put him to the test to see if he really is gay.  The results are more than a little bit amusing.  Not to be forgotten, the fantastic cast of ""Please Teacher!"" play supporting roles, most prominently the teacher herself, Mizuho Kazami, a beloved anime girl if ever there was one.  In fact, she shows up so often that it leads a main character to wonder aloud whether there are even any other teachers at the school.  But the best returning character by far is Ichigo Morino, the little girl who shared Kei's disease in ""Teacher"" which causes her to go into a state of suspended animation (or ""standstill"") when she loses the will to move forward with her own life.  Morino is now a devious class president with an evil little chuckle and a full-time hobby involving surveillance of her classmates and taking inappropriate pictures of them.  Shidou, on the other hand, has been relegated to uber-loser status this time around, becoming a one-note joke about lusting after his underage sister.  As if there wasn't enough incest in the show already, sheesh.  Despite the fact that this show is populated by characters from it's predecessor, it shares little in common with ""Teacher"" on the surface.  Still, the creators manage to put together another fine romantic comedy series that ends too soon, continually evolves and moves forward, and keeps you both entertained and rivetted.  The ending is a suprisingly definitive one, but it doesn't stop there.  After the initial 12-episode run, we are again treated to a bonus episode that acts as a coda to the series.  The plot involves Morino organizing an impromptu summer camp where the entire casts of both series get together for a great send-off to two of the best romantic-comedy animes out there.  It's also fun to see the huge shift in the dynamics of the relationship between the three ""twins"" following the events of the television show.  Faithful to the philosphy presented in both series, the show never stops accelerating, even at the end.  If you saw the first series and want more ""Teacher"", or if you thought that series was too tame then this is as good as it gets.  But if you are looking for some family-friendly entertainment to share with the kids, maybe you oughtta look elsewhere.",1168992000,64,3979,4.741279069767442
7346732,4,B012C86TMU,"An interesting series,not too much nudity so I would let a mature teen watch it. Still better than dragonball Z,but no ghost in the shell. The refridgerator magnets were amusing and the peek-a-boo 3D box design took a while to figure out. Mainly for a fan of the series which seems to be getting retold for the #rd time?",1151884800,5,320,4.440677966101695
7346733,5,B012C86TMU,"This series was a long appreciated TV event in its own days. It lasted nine years and had a strong unity in its geographic center: It was Jersey, the most famous of all Channel Islands, best known today for its status as a tax haven in Europe. And in the time of the series, it was already that in many ways, a channel for all kinds of traffic and illegal export and import activities, not to speak of drugs and even human trafficking.

Bergerac starts as a simple little small local Police Constable in the Bureau des Etrangers which is nothing but the local name of the police. He will eventually become a sergeant detective, but he will then leave the service to have some private life, mostly with the daughter of a winemaker in Vaucluse, France, but he will come back to Jersey as a private investigator under the authority of Charles Hungerford, the rich businessman who is the most influential member of the Law and Order Commission.

The first interest in the series is its length and the evolution of the cases dealt with in the various episodes, from petty crimes and petty traffics at first to international political situations and international illegal activities to be taken control of for the benefit of the authorities in what could be called institutionalized corruption. But the one case per episode kind of dilutes the force of the evolution. It is in a way cut up into thin baloney slices. In other words, it lacks unity and perspective.

The second interest is Bergerac himself as a police constable, detective, sergeant or not, and private investigator. He is the type of person who cannot abide by a set of rules that should be very clear for everyone including him of course and are systematically overlooked, by him particularly. Thats often dangerous for him or other people but it has the great charm of being effective because the shortcuts used by Bergerac surprise the criminals or delinquents and they are easier to trap and catch. Bergeracs interviewing technique is always fast, brutal, pressurizing more than empathetic. The one he considers as the culprit has to go through a rough time but that leads to quick results. This is of course totally unrealistic.

The third interest is to explore the relations between the States of Jersey and two neighboring countries, namely France and England. The relations with France are often courteous, at least with French cops. But with Bergerac having an affair with the daughter of a winemaker in Vaucluse, we are taken down south quite often in the last seasons to harvest grapes and make wine and at the same time to solve some criminal attempts there always connected in a way or another with Jersey. The affair will end up in the last episode of the last season with a Dear Jim letter and the immediate consequence of Bergerac who is an alcoholic falling back into the barrel of whiskey.

The fourth interest is the strongly sexist overtone, not undertone at all when we consider the various women with whom Bergerac has affairs after his divorce with his wife, Charles Hungerfords daughter, that took place before the very beginning of the series. For Bergerac, women are always secondary entertaining characters who are always shown as wanting a normal regular life without any fear and anxiety. To be the wife or girlfriend of a cop is to be the slave of any phone call in the middle of any one hour of the twenty-four hours a day normally counts. So Bergerac cannot have any normal and stable relationship with a woman because of his job.

To bring the series to an end, first he gets the Dear Jim Letter I have already mentioned and in the last case of the last episode where he is the private investigator of Charles Hungerford to make some art deals secure, we learn that he is going to be promoted to some kind of administrative job that will both satisfy him, use his competence in police work and take him away from the everyday life of simple cops, constables or policemen who both complain about and are thankful for Bergeracs meddling in their business. His promotion is a typical Peter Principle recognition of competence and promotion to a position where he will be incompetent but also inoffensive: all his underlings will do the work and he will vaguely overlook the general picture.

Altogether, this series is really entertaining and even maybe rather fascinating, and anyway a real testimony about the 1981-1990 period in Jersey, France, England and even Europe. That time has completely vanished in our modern times of Brexit and vast international migration.

Detective Sergeant Jim Bergerac of the Jersy States Police is considerably younger, more physical and somewhat less cerebral than DCI Tom Barnaby of the Midsomer Constabulary. Stories range in quality from the merely very good to the excellent and often have a surprising twist. Color of episodes is a bit off (the sea often appears greenish, for example) due to their age but otherwise a good transfer to DVD. Has accurate English subtitles, more so than usual. The price is on the high side, more than the region-free DVD player you need to watch them if you live in Region 1, but worth the money.",1472688000,,687,4.830508474576271

7346762,3,B012C86TMU,"Came without delay and was well packaged.  The case holding the CD's is not only great looking, but without a single mark or bruise on it.  I was really pleased at how good it looks, almost like a presentation piece.
Was a bit disappointed because Bergerac differed greatly in appearance to Tom Barnaby.  Bergerac was almost skinny with entirely different looking hair and a thin face that emphasized his nose.  Tom Barnaby is on the heavy set side with beefier shoulders and arms.  They are the same person but Tom's face is fatter and to me, much more attractive.  What a few years can make in one's appearance.
I have only watched the first disc and perhaps Bergerac will fatten up as the series progresses.
I like Midsomer Murders best because of the gorgeous colors and sceneries and of course, Cully and Joyce!
In summation, Bergerac is more of a private eye show, at least as far as I've seen so far.
IMPORTANT:  My years old hp computer, like most on the market, plays region 2 and 4, although I doubt if many people are aware of it.  I tried the first disc of Bergerac in my PC DVD player and it told me that I would have to make a selection to play region 2 and 4.  It then allowed me to choose the country which originated the disc, I chose England and Voila, the program started.  It stated that I would be allowed to change regions only 4 times, NO MORE!  I purchased a region 2 and 4 player which I haven't hooked up yet, but will soon!

AFTER WATCHING SEVERAL DISCS I FOUND THAT BERGERAC DOESN'T EVEN START TO COMPARE WITH JOHN NETTLES IN MIDSOMER MURDERS.  THE COLORS AREN'T AS VIVID AND APPEALING, THE MAIN CAST NEVER CHANGES AND THE MILLIONAIRE WITH A BIG CIGAR STUCK IN HIS FACE I FOUND TO BECOME IRRITATING.  THERE WAS TOO MUCH SITTING AROUND AT TABLES BLABBING AND SOME OF THE CONVERSATION WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE STORY LINE WHICH WAS SELDOM INTERESTING.  THE RED SPORTS CAR SOON BECAME DATED AND BERGERAC RUNNING AROUND WITH HIS SHIRT HALF OPEN DIDN'T APPEAL TO ME EITHER.

Bergerac seems to be too emotional to be in the same league as Columbo. IMHO the acting, actors, music, and stories are just better in Columbo. However the stories in Bergerac are varied mostly about him and father-in-law/father-in-law acquaintances - not necessarily murders.

7346781,4,B012C86TMU,"this show is a yuri (which means that it is a lesbian romance, with some explicit material) anime tv show. it is based on a manga of the same name
while it has action/adventure/mecha elements, the shining jewel of this tv show is the romance between the two main characters: himeko and chikane. they are born in a small village in japan and are unknowingly priestesses that are called upon every generation to defend the earth from the orochi, an evil group of mislead humans that are controlled by the head orochi spirit. the plot unfolds as they try to fight these demons, and live their lives at the same time

this has Japanese audio with English subtitles! I just wanted to get that out of the way because the product description wasn't very clear on that. anyway...

the romance in this show will have your heart tied in knots, you will be going through emotional peaks and troughs as you try to cope with the developing character relationships. I was able to relate to this show really easily, and I imagine most people that enjoy any type of romance will enjoy this, even if it is what some people would consider clich. and its not really, as many times I was going ""wtf?!"", I just think some people say that because the story has a happy ending

there is some fanservice, but not enough to where it makes you want to stop watching, just enough where it makes you pause and go ""really don't need this"" and then you will keep watching and be too engrossed in the story to care

***and you MUST watch the ENTIRE last episode, to the very end, to complete the story
***also, beware of a certain scene involving rape. the show shows absolutely none of the actual act, but it is so emotionally impactful (and once you look back on it, poorly handled, which is why this got a 4 and not a 5. really deserves a 5) that you will probably scream for about 5 minutes after that episode (just like I did)

just seriously, buy this and watch it. if you support this show, maybe in the future the anime community will get more heartfelt yuri/shoujo-ai than the handful they have now. please watch it, for your sake and mine",1395964800,3,2117,4.4318766066838045

7346791,5,B012C86TMU,"Its time to get that all-region dvd player.  The Bergerac boxed set contains 87 shows, 9 seasons worth of entertainment.  The regular season shows are approximately 45 minutes in length, the Christmas specials an hour and forty minutes or so.  Thus, you're getting the equivalent of 9 feature films, plus 78 episodes, without commercials.  There are similar values in other long-running British series.

Now, Bergerac: Bergerac is the John Nettles vehicle from the 1980s.  Nettles, who plays Tom Barnaby on the bulk of the Midsomer Murders series, is, here, younger, fitter and far more athletic.  British viewers who saw the series upon release regularly comment on his physical appearance and how the camera had a way of finding the most favorable shots.

Jim Bergerac is a detective sergeant at the Bureau des Etrangers in St. Helier, Jersey.  He is the lead detective among a small group lead by a timeserving boss with a short temper and an eye on promotion.  Jim is a recovering alcoholic, formerly married to Deborah Hungerford, whose father Charlie is a millionaire tax exile.  Charlie Hungerford is played by Terence Alexander and he is the only character who appears throughout the 9 seasons with John Nettles.

The Bureau des Etrangers investigates all sorts of casesmurder, robbery, drugsjust about anything that the existence of vast wealth and the proximity to France might occasion.  The initial shows (seasons 1-7, more or less) have an action-adventure feel.  The opening credits show Bergerac in action sequences, with a pulsing score in the background.  There is a sort of Quinn Martin, 70s vibe to the shows, with clothing styles to match.  Bergerac drives a 1947 Triumph Roadster, which looks very cool but was notoriously difficult to start, stop, drive and maneuver.

In the last two seasons, things get a little strange.  Apparently it was felt that the Jersey setting had been exhausted, so that Jim acquires a French girlfriend, with many shows being shot, principally, in France.  There is also an increased number of location shootings in England.  Bergerac has four separate girlfriends in the course of the series, plus his ex-wife, Deborah.  Together they have a daughter, Kim, who appears more regularly in the early series and disappears altogether in the later ones.

The quality of the shows is generally high.  The writers and directors are not afraid to take risks, so that some of the episodes are quirky and surprising in their plots and endings.  By series 9 one has the feeling that the scripts are even experimental and far-off-the-beaten-track.  In general, the series yields reliable entertainment.  Nettles carries the show and Terence Alexander serves as a roguish sidekick.

The British remember this fondly; American audiences will enjoy it as well.",1381708800,9,2797,5.130530973451328

When the pilots cross this barrier, the realize that Earth is actually in a different time continuum. The crew of the Watcher's Nest must collapse this barrier to stop the invasion, even if it costs them their ticket home, and their relationship with Misaki.

This DVD is the 2nd season of Divergence Eve. It is better than the 1st season, but still a little better than average. I like the way season 2 starts off. We get a better understanding of Misaki's feelings and we see some flashbacks about her past.  This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized., especially in season 1. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you.

I've read some bad reviews of this anime. I don't really get why people don't like it. It has great animation, voice acting, music, characters, plot, and a very touching conclusion. My only issue with this one is the length. It's 12 episodes long. Like many more animes this series could have been way better with more depth and character development. It's very difficult to create a massively emotional series in that short of a time. This anime was trying to do that. It succeeded in being great, but could have been much better with more story. This anime doesn't suffer from being short though. It's still very good. I recommend this for any anime fan that's 14 or older. I love it!",1351296000,11,1322,4.601694915254237

I love this series. It is the sequel to the Please Teacher series. Some of the characters return in the Twins series, but the plot is totally original. The animation and voice acting are very good. You will recognize Johnny Yong Bosch from Bleach and Eureka Seven. He plays Mike in this anime. The story is very touching and also quite funny. It has a few awkward moments considering that the 2 girls in love with Mike may be his sisters. But I can see that happening if you just met someone for the first time in 16 years, and you're not even sure if it's the truth or not. This anime has no flaws that I can think of.

This story is fun to watch, but it's one of the most perverted and over the top animes I've ever seen. There are some interesting characters and some emotional moments.

7346815,4,B012C86TMU,"Ah, anime. Never content to just tell a simple story, they have to throw in every trick in the book and several from out of it to create something completely bonkers. Such is the case with Glass Maiden also known as Crystal Blaze. It has all the elements of crime noir, a womanizing detective, the determined crime boss, the heartless assassin, the dogged reporter, and even the kid sidekick.

But then you get the whole sci-fi angle, with the women turning into glass, the mad scientist bent on creating the perfect weapon (who happens too look like a little girl), and whole doctor who has his nurse perform S&M games with him.

The result is a show that ranges from exciting and intense to intensely goofy. Shu is a darn cool character, but we end up knowing little about him. Most of the series is focused on where the glass maidens come from and the antics of Manami and Ayaka. This does two things. It keeps the series interesting by constantly shifting focus. But it also ends up with that odd tone disconnect. Some scenes go for over the top laughs others go from mystery and suspense.

Roman Martel, DVD Verdict --We also get a lot of cliche anime moments and characters. Ayaka is that typical character that is melancholy and monotone and usually turns out to be a robot. The main villain is your typical cold, calm and cruel scientist type whose sociopathic devotion to his research overpower everything else. The end result is something that just doesn't quite click. Glass Maiden never becomes bad or uninteresting, but I wish they would have gone with a straighter story, fewer comedy characters, and a harder edge. Something closer to Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom in tone would have been more interesting.

The animation is solid with a pleasing character design and some interesting backgrounds and settings. Most of the action scenes are fluid and fast paced and there are plenty of them. Anyone looking for some fan service will be pleased to note that most of the glass maidens end up nude at some point. I also enjoyed the musical score by Ryo Sakai who worked some jazzy pieces in with the unnerving suspense and horror material.

Maiden Japan puts all 12 episodes on two discs. The 1.78:1 standard definition image is nice and clean with solid blacks and ample clarity. The Dolby 2.0 stereo Japanese mix balances the dialogue and the music just fine. No English dub here. The only extras are clean opening and ending credits.

In one sense, Bergerac seems caught in some time warp between the 1940's mysteries of Chandler (cop jaded to the soul, but still almost mindlessly committed on running villains to ground) and the more glib style of early 1980's police stories where the focus is on the reaction of the cop(s) to the crimes and villains.

In any case, it is all a sparkling great collection of police stories in a beautiful land.  Thank goodness that multiregion DVD players are dirt cheap.",1315267200,18,592,4.784313725490196
7346818,5,B012C86TMU,"I enjoyed the first series, Please Teacher so that is why I watched this series.  The events here offically start when Mizuho first appeared on this planet.  when three people see a house on a news cast of a UFO sighting, it is the beginning of a very interesting story.  Miku works as a computer programmer, and goes to the same high school as Kei Kusinagi.  He is an orphan with unusual blue eyes, and a picture with him and a little girl.  But when two young ladies arrive, they not only have the same eyes, but also the same photos which leaves a question, who is related and who is a stranger?  AS the three live together, the two girls form an alliance in order to determine who is family and who is the stranger, keep other girls away from Miku, and when they find out who the sister is, support the romance between the other girl and Miku.  But when a chance discovery brings the truth to light, can the alliance hold up?

While the story is good, there are a few things I did not like.  The made Miss Kasimi (the alien from Onegai Teacher) and airhead, and Mantagu a complete freak (even more so than the first time).  But I enjoyed Ichigo's complete turnaround from a shy young lady to the most informed person on the campus (heh heh heh), and that at least everyone from the first movie makes a small appearance.  When this came out there was a book bassed on the anime (unlike Teacher which had a book and manga), and while they changed some parts of the ending (the person who is the relative is the same, but who MIku chooses to love....wellllll) they still kept to the spirit of the series.  OF course there was supposed to be a third series (Please Friend) but it never made it to production.  Overall a good series and a Anime Legend in its own right.",1310601600,,1768,4.305135951661631

After the end of the first series, we catch up with the beautiful sisters of the blade still leading the people's army in defeating the local bandits (the yellow turban group), but Kanf'u is feeling the the urge to go on another journey.  The arrival of a new girl named Ryuga tells the story that the Ryuga from Saya the last series was an imposter and that the sword he had was actually hers, which gives Kanf'u, Rin-Rin, Sei, and an excuse to get away for a while.  As they journey, a trio of performing sisters receive a book of magic from a traveling mage and they get instant fame, but does this power come with a cost?

This series introduces a group of new characters and brings back everyone you enjoyed from the first, from Lord Sosho (yes she is still trying to get close to Kanf'u, and yes the same thing happens), to Ryofu.

In a scene in which he's helping to find one of the lost girls, he's using a ""dowsing rod"", but he refers to it as a ""douching rod"", and it's attached to his pants; for some reason I thought that was hilarious.

One, if you watched it in the Dub, I completely understand why you didn't like it.  I personally never watch Dubs because I enjoy the way they were intended to be and also most English voice actors/actresses are not so good at protraying the appropriate emotion.  Kannazuki no Miko is a beautiful story of two girls on opposite sides.  Himeko is shy and sweet, whereas Chikane is strong and powerful.  They make friends easily but what they are not aware of is their awful and hopeless fate.  Forever finding their love and losing it, forever fighting, and forever discovering the pain between the dance of the moon and the sun...  As a girl and yuri lover I am proof that this anime, and for that matter, this genre is more than an execuse for perversity.  :) JK But truly, All of you who find the dub empty, watch the japanese version.  And to all of you thinking about watching it- do.",1282003200,14,951,4.425287356321839

Before Midsomer Murders, John Nettles had a long-running hit from 1981 - 1991 with ""Bergerac"", as a recovering alcoholic police officer who plays fast and loose with the rules.  He operates in The Bailiwick of Jersey which is a British Crown Dependency off the coast of Normandy, France.  Together with the Bailiwick of Guernsey, it forms the grouping known as the Channel Islands. Jersey is a separate possession of the Crown and is not part of the United Kingdom although The United Kingdom is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey.

The scenery is luscious, the supporting cast is excellent, and John Nettles is very, very young.  Quite a different character from Inspector Barnaby, who is very laid-back, and always plays by the rules.

Please note that this series is not available in a Region 1 NTSC version for the U.S. market.  THESE ARE REGION 2 PAL DISKS. REQUIRES A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC.",1281657600,32,1222,4.990147783251231

7346828,4,B012C86TMU,"First of all, I think it's ridiculous to give any series 1 star just because it's released in it's native language.  I hate to break it to you, but most foreign films are released in their native language with subtitles.  Anime has been the sole exception for the last few years, but the slow down in DVD sales and the retail market has finally caught up to it.  These titles aren't done sub-only to rush them out.  They are done sub-only as they cannot be produced profitably with a dub.  It costs a few thousand dollars to dub each episode, and most anime series only sell a few thousand copies at best subbed or dubbed.  Many anime series sell only a few hundred, and its very unlikely that the very marginal amount of sales lost by Polyphonica would be enough to finance the dub.

On to the actual show itself.  While the artwork and design is definitely interesting, the animation is a bit lacking in areas.  There is even a notorious car chase scene which is actually quite bad.  But despite those flaws, the show itself is not bad.  The characters are likable enough.  The music is good, and the story lines are interesting.  For those who are really curious there are a couple streaming fee online at Anime Network, so you can give it a try.

This show does try, but in the end, it is missing something that it needs to really stand out.  There is a second season/ remake of the show that has not been licensed for the US yet, and it apparently improves upon this one.  Polyphonica isn't a bad show, but it's not particularly great either.  However, the price of entry is quite reasonable.

And I would have given this show 3 stars, but felt it necessary to up that to 4 to counterbalance the childish and uncalled for 1 star review.  This is a Japanese show that will likely only move a couple thousand units.  There is nothing wrong with experiencing it in it's native language.",1269388800,10,1888,4.448979591836735
7346829,3,B012C86TMU,"When I saw this, I was really excited. It looked interesting, and the back of it claims that the main character, Phoron, and his spirit Corticarte (Corti for short) travel around with his one-man orchestra/motorcycle fixing the ills of the world!

That's what it says, but it fails to deliver. The story barely touches on subjects a lot of people may want to know about. Back-stories on the characters are superficial at best, and some characters aren't even worth knowing. There are at least three that are shown in the opening or appear once in the show and you don't learn anything about them. Not one thing. A white-cat spirit asks a question in one episode, and shows up in the last one. Do you get to know who he is or why he's there? Nope. Also, a detective and his spirit show up a few times, and are granted their own customized ending for the episode they show up in. Really? They aren't the main characters and they get their own ending? They barely did anything!

The music aspect is good however. I love the opening and ending themes! They grow on you and the use of music to help the spirits fight is a nice addition too. I wish they could have gone into more detail about those things though....

The Anime also talks about Corti's reputation as a supreme badass. Again, this is something you really don't get to see. In fact, I'm trying to think back to any real indication that she is a ""Crimson Annihilator"". Even in the flashback which explains how she and Phoron met there is some action but nothing really violent or extreme.

It's also too short, which can explain a lot of the issues with character development (almost none) and plot.

All in all, it is worth watching once. I would say that you should probably check out the game of this that's out or the manga/novels. I'm sure they'll be needed to fill in the gaps.",1267315200,9,1841,4.467261904761905

I read the other review that was 1 star and there are some points BUT I love this anime. It sort of ( probably not a good comparison at all actually) reminds me of a mix of Wedding Peach and Transformers in a way. But it is good if you like this kind of thing. It is a lot how the other guy said as far as the story is and stuff but when I am looking for a drama anime weather it be yuri or yaoi any drama or action types I look for specific anime with the story line that I am looking for. I do not have high hopes when they are a blend of things such as when you have to mesh a drama story line and an actiony type story line. Yes this one has some yuri under tones and some other boy loves girl bits and yes in every episode there is a fight between the bad guys attacking the good guys but it tells you what it is about right on the back of the box so WHAT DO YOU EXPECT in a 20 minute episode?

Find a way to watch a couple of episodes first. I will honestly say that I am really not so sure if I liked the story from Divergence Eve or not. I was too horrified by the terrible animation to really get the gist of the plot, but I do remember enough to know that I didn't care for the story line Misaki Chronicles at all. But to be blunt about the whole thing the CG animations portions seemed like they were a last minute decision to tack on. And the characters were horrible, the only character that didn't have gigantic, out of proportion, pointy, bouncy(and I mean they go crazy...like flying all over for the whole show) breasts and was female was the like 12 year old android. So if you care about things like the animation, and how well drawn it was. You might want to think twice, but like I said that is my opinion...rent it and see if you can make it through 3 episodes without wanting to use the discs as weapons against its creators then make your decision.",1256947200,,1135,4.2592592592592595

Even taken in context, it is hard to believe a series can be this disjointed, incomprehensible, full of plot holes and thematically self-contradictory at the same time.  Any individual episode can be fun in and of itself, but trying to make sense of the over-arching plot is enough to give you a headache.  The final nail in the coffin is:  The closest thing this series has to a comprehensive plot is Lyar's frequent oaths that she won't die before her omiai (a Japanese arranged wedding).  But at the end of the series, the writers somehow forget about this pledge.

There are only two reasons to watch this series:  computer graphics and giant breasts.  The computer graphics are no longer cutting edge and the football sized (and shaped) breasts adorning the women are more comical than sexy.

Is it super original?  No.  Does it make use of stock situations and characters? Yes.  Is this an animie for everyone? Of course not, few are.  But it's still good fun!  Nothing very serious.  It's a light hearted romantic comedy with a hint of mystery, and a heavy dose of wishful and wistful male teenage perversion (not quite Porky's, but pointed in that direction).  There was a scene or two I could've done without.  (Really could've done without!)  There were a few `oh my gawd they didn't' moments, along with a buncha goofy silly funny moments, and even a sorta sad and reflective moment. There's lotsa fanservice, and it seems to increase as the series progresses.  I have a feeling the show is tilted towards guys, but I do know a gal or two that liked the romantic angle.

Like I said previously, there's a bit of a mystery.  On my first watching, I wasn't that observant, and missed a lot of (not at all subtle) clues.  I think I enjoyed my second viewing more because I understood things better, and could see right away story elements I didn't realize the importance of to begin with.

Overall, I liked it, enjoyed it, and was sad when it ended.  I found it to be a crowd pleaser, and that's always good too.  For all intents and purposes, it did its' job.  I wanted to be entertained and laugh, and I was entertained, and I laughed.",1251072000,4,1535,4.414285714285715

Animation still looks good, if you can get passed the unnecessarily huge boobs. It's really distracting and disturbing at the same time. I mean, here we have a very serious story with very confusing time travel themes and then you have unnaturally big, unreasonably jiggly boobs shoved in your face. This is not fan service, it's plain annoying. For true use of fan service see Agent Aika.

CGI is horrible, there is no improvement at all.  Ghoul creatures look scary yet can't even take a step forward, how stupid is that.  Mecha looks like trash cans scattered around, so funny.

I had to push myself to the limit to finish the series. The episodes are boring to the death because the action is so very stale and dull. Addition to this I can't remember a single funny moment, not one joke.

I can't really recommend this work because as you can see, it's not my cup of tea. I really can't understand how anyone could rate this anime 5 stars.

The main plot is kind of interesting and the characters are well fleshed out. You do get to see characters from Please Teacher a fair bit which is nice. It also takes place in the same town, which in some ways is my favorite ""character"".

My main problem with the show was the gratuitous amount of footage of the two young girls naked. Now, a lot of people will argue that this is acceptable in Japanese culture, if not normal. Perhaps it is. But know that almost if not every episode includes lots of footage of the two main girls conversing together who are underage if not prepubescent completely nude in a bathing situation. Some situations including sexual references for humor's sake. While in no way would I call this pornography or even child pornography, I am not a lawyer and do not know where the line is drawn. I can see how in a legal situation someone in the United States could argue it as such. Just a fair warning. Beyond that, I am a 31 year old male with a pretty open mind but I felt very uncomfortable watching the show.

Beyond the repetitive bathing scenes there is a lot of other repetition. You get to hear the main characters say that ""they might be relatives, but they might not"" about three times and episode, which gets old (yeah, we get it).

  Sum of the Story
Knowing what happen at watcher's nest, Misaki wants to change the future so everyone can survive. She wants to be happy again, no more tears ever again. But the thing is... It's from the past. The story takes you when Misaki enters the Allied Base Camp and continues her way to Watcher's Nest. The sequel will fill in the gaps that were left in Divergence Eve.  It's up to Lyar Von Ertiana and Kiri Marialate to go and figure out why watcher's nest hasn't been destroyed and also find Misaki.

I don't want to ruin the whole story. But you will see alot of events that happen in the past, so pay close attention to the story. The story will take place from the past and present. Also listen what the characters have to say. Sometimes they will give hints and a better understanding to the story. If you don't get what they are saying, enable the subtitles. Sometimes the subtitles will help you out and you will understand what they are saying. The graphics are much better and the acting is better. So they did alot of work in misaki chronicles. The sound of the wind is amazing! The effects are much better! As a little bonus, Misaki Father (Juzo) has a little role in the story and he will also have a big part of the whole story

This anime is a really artistic way of saying home is where you choose to make it. It is a wonderful anime that speaks volumes of teenage angst, wanting to belong, and what it takes to make a true home for yourself in the world.

I think the last episode (kinda like a hidden music track on a CD) was a really nice surprise. The second to the last episode is announced as the ""last episode"". Then the credits roll and there is a VERY risque ""final episode"" after the ""last episode"" which is very enjoyable both in humor and suggestive content.

There is a lot of fan service in this but it is actually tastefully done. My delicate sensibilities weren't offended and I thought it was almost a sincere act of moving the story along (almost).

This is funny material too. Especially when you put yourself in the position of our hero. He is a young man trying to make it on his own steam and not one, but two hotties enter his life. The sudden nose bleeds are timed well and laugh out loud funny.

There are plenty of unexpected twists that keep the content interesting even when the initial excitement of the opening episodes wears off.

This is worth your money if you enjoyed that time in your life when you were anxious to get closer to someone in your life but were scared to. Almost like a drawn out dating experience... you want it... but aren't sure you can have it... so you're patient but anxious all at the same time...

Like the first, if you like series that you have to piece together in your head, or watch over again, it's a pretty good and thought provoking idea. This second series also focuses more on the character's motivations and feelings than the first. Still, neither does a great job of character development.

7346853,5,B012C86TMU,"This is a great series, and if you haven't seen please teacher i highly suggest it but what i think you would love is,  Modori Days and one that I think would blow you away would be Ouran Highschool Host Club!",1198022400,,209,4.097560975609756
7346854,2,B012C86TMU,"Well, I should have known from the cover but the price was soooo good...

The bouncy breasts are so frequent and out of proportion it is just stupid...
The story was not as meaningful as the atmosphere wanted you to believe...

This is one of the few titles in my collection I am sad to have made the purchase on.

I LOVE time travel stories, I always catch time travel movies and books. This one was not a highlight in my time traveling experiences.

In some places the story was so shallow... I felt like I was in a kiddy pool. Not impressive... and the 3D looks VERY much removed from the art.

Truly hard to watch. Completely a fan service anime... and little more IMHO.",1195344000,9,674,4.317460317460317

7346856,4,B012C86TMU,"I watched this with a need for something light-hearted and was not disappointed. The subtitles match the English voice track pretty well so there's not much to lose listening to the Japanese.
I found it sufficiently different in story and character detail from other anime to be a worthwhile addition to my collection.
It has a VERY strong fanservice content, a middling comedy aspect and a nicely handled romantic story line. Sure, there are some ecchi aspects that were not my cup of tea, but on the whole I enjoyed it.",1191628800,17,521,4.736263736263736
7346857,5,B012C86TMU,"When I saw Please Teacher, I wanted to see Please Twins. ""Twins"" has a different story line. This is about a boy named Maiku Kamishiro, who grew up in an orphanage with no past except for a childhood picture of himself and a person who he believes is his missing twin sister. After a long time, Maiku left the orphanage to live on his own in the house in the picture. Maiku works as a programmer in order to pay the rent and goes to the same high school the ""Teacher"" cast goes to. One day, a girl named Mina arrives at his doorstep with the same photo. She then asked Maiku if she can since they were twins, but Maiku didn't know what to do. In the middle of all the confusion, another girl named Kaden shows up with the same photo. The only to tell who is that the twin is that in the picture the twins has blue eyes, but both the girls has blue eyes. Who is the twin and who is the stranger? This is a great show and you will see co-stars from ""Teacher"" on there too.",1191283200,,970,4.0310880829015545
7346858,2,B012C86TMU,"Green Green has a great opening sequence, awesome extra content on each disk, and is available at one of the best prices I've ever seen for an anime collection. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it that's good.

I didn't like any of the character designs, and many of them I found extremely annoying. The storyline is nonexistent; it's just a bunch of horny highschool boys chasing after a bunch of girls for 12 episodes. And while this sounds like it should be the setting for a great comedy, it's not. I didn't laugh once during the entire series.

Normally I love anything with fanservice no matter how bad the story is, but even with the abundant girls Green Green just wasn't at all entertaining to me. Moreover, while I was watching I just wanted to turn it off and never watch it again, that's how bad it is.
I can only recommend Green Green for the most hardcore of anime collectors, anyone else shouldn't waste their money.",1187222400,19,940,4.556213017751479
7346859,5,B012C86TMU,"I first got exposed to Divergence Eve/Misaki Chronicles through a friend who recommended it.  After doing some research, it looked like nothing more than an anime that was full with well-endowed women.  I bit the bullet and purchased both the first and second seasons, and I must say it's a fantastic show.

Divergence Eve is a great kickoff point to the series, although the first few episodes are a little heavy on the fanservice(boobs).  Give it a bit though, and this season really turns around and by the end it leads perfectly into the sequel, Misaki Chronicles.

The sequel is fairly confusing at first, but if you enjoy the theory of time travel and parallel universes than you will love this.  If not, you should still be able to follow what's going on, they explain it pretty clearly in my opinion.
Misaki Chronicles starts off very differently then DE, instead of the fanservice it gets right to the meat of the story and wastes no time.  The plot is what really surprised me about this anime, and what compelled me to write a review about it.  The character development is very well done, especially in the latter half of the 2nd season.  In all I'd summarize this show as being a very heartwarming one, the conclusion of the story is very nicely done and ties up all the loose ends.

If you can look past the large breasted women, you're in for a wild ride.  This is a very solid anime and one that I recommend to anyone who doesn't mind seeing a heartwarming story.",1183939200,19,1479,4.543396226415094
7346860,5,B012C86TMU,"As for the story it was great,good enough for me to follow the story too the next series.  Watch out though if you don't like big busty women then you will hate this serier all together.  Check it out you like it.",1183852800,3,213,4.0476190476190474
7346861,5,B012C86TMU,"In ""Please Twins"", three teenagers, a boy and two girls, who never knew their mother see a house on the news that resembles a house in a photograph they all have. The photo has the house in it with children playing in a kiddie pool in it as well. All three head to the house to try and find their family. All are surprised to find each other there and they quickly discover that they all used to live in the house. Only one problem...there are THREE teenagers and there are only TWO children in the photograph. Since the photograph has a boy and a girl in the pool, then obviously one of the two girls the the boy's sister and the other is just a stranger. Antics ensue as they all try to earn a living, make it through school, and find out which of the two girls doesn't belong. If you enjoy romance-comedies and Anime, then you'll love ""Please Twins!""!
NOTE: Contains adult situations. Recommended for HIGH SCHOOLERS!",1181001600,,919,4.411764705882353
7346862,5,B012C86TMU,"2 girls, both in love with the same guy. But one of them might be his twin sister, and they have no idea which one it is! Naturally this leads to many very funny situations.

Please Twins is all about drama and comedy, and both are very enjoyable. The storyline has a great begining middle and end, to keep you entertained the whole time you're watching.

If you're a fan of teen romantic comedies, then Please Twins should definately be a part of your collection.",1179100800,3,464,4.447058823529412
