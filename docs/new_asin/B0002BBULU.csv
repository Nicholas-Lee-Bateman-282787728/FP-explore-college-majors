8025660,5,B0002BBULU,"Being new to owning a handgun, this video covered all areas I needed to know about having a handgun and taking care of a gun.",1375142400,,125,4.04
8025661,1,B0002BBULU,"I paid much le$$ for this DVD somewhere else online but still to expensive for its contents. Excellent and very entertaining for beginners men, women & juniors with ""cero"" knowledge of guns or shooting experience. Covers the difference between a single action and double action revolvers and semi-automatic pistols plus everything you need to know about owning, operating and shooting accurately.
Useless for handgun owners or experienced shotters already familiar with both, revolvers and semi-automatic pistols.",1217980800,9,513,5.7631578947368425
8025662,1,B0002BBULU,"In the first place, although advertised as a DVD, I received a video tape (VCR) version....Not a good thing!

Secondly, if you have absolutely no idea of what a handgun is, then you may find this product informative.  The video does an adequate job of explaining the difference between the trigger, the hammer, and the barrel.  Even then, it's worth only half of the list price (at best).

The product spent too much time explaining what a handgun is and how to load and unload the cartridges, and too little time exploring shooting techniques.

To say that the presentation is overly elementary is an understatement.",1135123200,47,617,4.838095238095238
