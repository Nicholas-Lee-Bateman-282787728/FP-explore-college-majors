The scene on the front cover is the best latex scene, everything else falls short in my opion. The DVD itself has quite a few extras and a couple bonus scenes that aren't that great, but it's rare to see interviews with the stars on the DVD they're in.

Worth a viewing, and then you can probably move on...",1213833600,,411,4.466666666666667
