The acting is mostly top notch.  The young actors in the early episodes were great and make you care about their characters from the beginning.  It seemed a little odd to see Song Il-Gook as an emotionally tortured ""bad guy"" rather than a hero, but he did it well.  It got 4 stars instead of 5 because it dragged a little in the middle. If you know a little korean history the ending won't be a surprise; it's inevitable. The first third of this drama is so exciting it's worth the price of admission.",1277769600,,679,4.451612903225806
8227437,4,B000X9WU0Q,The version I got was really a Chinese product with both Korean and Chinese. The english subtitles were translated from Chinese and so the Korean names and places were really strange in English. If you know alot of Korean with the english subtitles you can follow the story but if you don't know Chinese or Korean you would be lost a lot of the time.,1266278400,2,350,4.4
8227438,1,B000X9WU0Q,The DVDs were advertized as new by the seller but that was not so. The DVDs have been used extensively and one disk is a total write-off.  Bad deal.,1228003200,4,148,4.103448275862069
