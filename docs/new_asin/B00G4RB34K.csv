6058159,5,B00G4RB34K,"It has been quite a few years now since I first saw THE IRON GIANT in theaters. I can't remember the last time I was drawn to a film in the way I was drawn to THE IRON GIANT. I ended up seeing this film 10 times in theaters over a two-month period. The film's trailer initially brought it to my attention. After I saw THE IRON GIANT on opening day, I had to see again and again and so fourth. Needless to say, I liked the film very much. I consider it one of my favorite films. Why? That is not an easy answer. All I can say is that I genuinely consider this to be a GOOD film and it has some enigmatic heartfelt intrinsic value to many that see it. It is not just a kid's film. It is not just a family film. It is a film for everyone. After my second or third viewing in theaters, I became interested in the audience's reactions. There was always a cheer or a sniffle or a shed tear rolling down a cheek. I remember one father saying to a gang of kids when the movie was over, ""That was a good one. We should have taken mommy with us."" I thought I was alone in my reaction to this film. After I got hooked up to the Internet, I found that there were literally thousands of people who were also moved by this film. And it seems that we all repeated one act of endorsement: we told as many people as we could to go see THE IRON GIANT. The closest I can come to saying why I liked THE IRON GIANT is that it somehow made me reflect on my life's experiences in a very nostalgic and endearing way, yet it did not let me forget that we still grow and learn new experiences every new day. We keep learning from those experiences. We must never stop moving forward but we should also never lose sight of the past. I will never forget THE IRON GIANT.",1414800000,,1741,3.991404011461318
