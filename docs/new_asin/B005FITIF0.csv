4675798,5,B005FITIF0,"After I read the book I could not wait for the movie to come out. I have seen it three times. It was excellent. A very moving and strong story of a man's efforts to change the lives of so many children for the better and his own life eventually.
Sam  Childers is a great man and Gerard Butler portrayed him perfectly; his performance is Oscar worthy.  Everyone should see this movie and learn from it.  I will definitely buy the dvd.",1320883200,19,433,4.2560975609756095
4675799,5,B005FITIF0,"WOW, what an awesome performance by Gerard Butler (Oscar worthy, in my opinion). This movie has an incredible message that needs to be seen.  I have read the book three times and have been so overwhelmed by Sam Childers' mission to save children and his transformation.  Gerard Butler got it right with his passion and hard work in nailing down Sam Childers. I was lucky enough to be within 70 miles of one of the few theaters that showed it.  Why did Relativity Media abandon this movie?  Aren't they in the business of making money? I guess the world will have to wait for the DVD. Don't suppose they will cancel that too?  Keep up the good work Sam Childers and Gerard Butler!",1320624000,13,679,4.487804878048781
4675800,5,B005FITIF0,"I have seen Machine Gun Preacher, though it was not easy to do so in the US, due to the lousy PR efforts by Relativity Media (its head, Ryan Cavanaugh is allegedly a friend of Gerard's).  I recommend it, as it is probably Butler's best  performance to date.  He is an emotional guy, and it shows always, even in lackluster films like The Bounty Hunter.  Here, we see what he can do.  The film itself suffers from being too much story for one film but it is a fascinating take on a true story of a man who is willing to be a warrior missionary, not a peace loving missionary.

He comes across as a violent man, a biker criminal who learns to take that violence and refocus it.  You get the impression here is a man, who, in his early life, would have smashed anyone in his way.  You do not have to agree with his approach as a missionary, but just understand that it was that or totally retreat from his work in the Sudan.  The warlord involved in the Sudan is still there, and still killing, and the US government has sent 100 military ""aides"" to help the new government there stop this warlord.

See the film on DVD and decide for yourself if Sam Childers (the biker) was right or wrong.",1320624000,14,1188,4.24
4675801,5,B005FITIF0,"I've seen the film 6 times in 6 different places all across the country, and I saw it with Sam Childers the first time he saw it. It's an amazing story about a nearly unbelievable journey by a man who went from crazy bad to crazy good, 'cos it takes a little crazy to do what he'd done as a young man and what he's done in Africa over the past decade. Fortunately there is less confrontation with the LRA in the area where the Shekinah Children's Village is near Nimule, South Sudan; and Sam Childers is spreading his feeding programs wider across central and east Africa where they're needed so badly, like in Somalia and Darfur. The book Another Man's War, the feature film Machine Gun Preacher and the upcoming documentary film will touch your heart in some fashion. Gerard Butler does a terrific job portraying both the old and new Sam. The Machine Gun Preacher DVD will be my gift for Christmases and birthdays for the next several years.",1319673600,62,943,4.52046783625731
4675802,5,B005FITIF0,"I've read the book and seen the movie.  The book will keep you awake at night and the movie will leave you breathless.  It's one thing to read the words because you have to rely on your imagination to form the images from the author's words.  Seeing those words accurately portrayed on the screen is incredible.

This is, bar none, Gerard Butler's crowning performance.  Sam Childers pulled no punches about himself in the book and Butler truly brought the man to life on the screen.  He isn't just an actor playing a part; in this movie it's almost as if he *becomes* Childers.  The scene where he returns to retrieve the children he had to leave behind is, IMO, mindblowing.  The scene in which he confronts and overcomes his crisis of faith is moving in the extreme.

I won't minimize:  This story, in the book and on the screen, is horribly disturbing, and I can't stress that enough.  However, it is incredibly powerful, thought-provoking, complex and heart-rending.  Once you've seen this movie, you definitely won't forget it.

Honestly, I'd give it ten stars without hesitation...",1318896000,149,1088,4.816216216216216
4675803,5,B005FITIF0,"I,also, read the book Another Man's War.  Sam Childers didn't pull punches or try to sugar coat his previous actions. He saw the horrible atrocities that were happening and decided to help the children with God's help. I have waited as so many others have to see the movie, Machine Gun Preacher. After waiting months, much to my dismay (& anger) I am unable to see it because I would have to drive 150 miles to see it. Relativity Media who supposedly was distributing it, released it in a few movie theaters skipping some states all together!! It's a shame since Gerard Butler appeared on many, many TV, radio, press interviews to let people know about the film and Sam Childers.  Well we know about them but we can't see them so I will wait for the DVD unless Relativity Media prevents that also!! I don't know whose making the decisions in that company but they are wrong decisions.",1318723200,23,884,4.553459119496855
4675804,5,B005FITIF0,"I read the book and really enjoyed it. One thing about Sam Childers is he doesn't hide behind his religion. He shows his warts, he shows his failures, and he shows Gods love and grace in his life and the children he saves. He was in Sudan when the rest of the world either ignored the murders or was afraid to act.

I haven't seen the movie yet so honestly I can only attest to the book. It was great. I found it disturbing that the description by the Amazon staff reviewer appeared so pre-biased and racist against this man. I will be seeing this film along with my whole family when it comes out in a few weeks. If as good as the book it is likely I will be buying the DVD as well.

If only more Christian men had the convictions of Mr. Childers. I hope to be one of them.",1318464000,14,774,4.01948051948052
4675855,5,B005FITIF0,"Here we go again Gerard Butler outdid himself with this character.  The movie is about a man who in the beginning is let out of prison for drugs and trouble making.  Coming home he finds his wife has changed.  Coming home he finds his wife has changed.  She is no longer the breadwinner of the family as her previous occupation was stripper and all that it entails.  Gerard character wants her to go back to stripping and she refuses because she is a model mother of church going status and more interested in raising her children with out the influence of their never to do well dad.  His wife finally convinces him to attend church with her and the children. and in doing so  He has an epiphany while attending church to help the children of East Africa.  After witnessing unspeakable horrors faced by innocent children he vows to save them at any cost, including his own safety. Gerard character Sam Childers begins waging a relentless battle against the territory's renegade militia, leading harrowing missions behind enemy lines to rescue kidnapped orphans and restore peace to their lives and eventually his own.",1519344000,,1118,4.786458333333333

4675885,5,B005FITIF0,"A wonderful movie about what it means to follow God wherever you're called and what it means to be forgiven. Some of the most guinuine and humble Christians I've ever met have been rough, down to earth people. Gerard Butler does a wonderful job of driving home the spiritual topics in the movie and showing Sam's tranformation.

4675927,5,B005FITIF0,"The production and editing is uneven, nothing that a few more million in the budget couldn't have cured though. The basics are all there... Strong acting, all characters completely believable and authentic. The church scenes could be a lot better, and 20 minutes of general mediocrity could easily be trimmed out. Nonetheless, a powerful based-on-facts story. A couple of scenes are among the best I've ever seen... like near the end when the scarred-cheek boy finally speaks... deeply moving! Michael Shannon is one of my fave B-list actors and is very strong and multi-layered in his supporting role. Make sure to watch the actual footage of Sam Childers at the end as the credits roll. Overall, a strong 5 stars from me for the breadth of human-experience covered. Not many films cover SO much territory. It's better and deeper than the chintzy title suggests!",1497657600,2,863,5.0

4676242,3,B005FITIF0,"I wanted to love this movie.  I just couldn't figure out how a story so compelling didn't make more at the box office.  Well it's just not told as well as it could be.  Michelle Monaghan is the highlight of the movie.  She delivers as the wife.  You feel her pain her love, her anger, her support.  At every turn, she makes this movie real.  Madeline Carroll is also very touching as the daughter.  The photography of some of the shots is also excellent.

Butler doesn't do a bad job but I think it's really the plot that fails on this.  Who is the antagonist?  Is it Kony/LRA?  Is it Sam Childers' demons?  Is it American complacency?  All of the above, and yet none of the above.  The story needed focus.  The church scenes mostly stumble as well.  Perhaps that part could have been handled through flashbacks or dialog.  I think it's very hard for Hollywood to accurately recreate the true intensity of drama that a conversion experience entails.

All that said, you still have to watch the movie.  The story of Sam Childers is very compelling and raises questions we should all be asking about what it means to really love and what it means to change your life.",1476403200,3,1165,4.457142857142857

It is a primal story of good and evil, and because the evil is Muslim extremists murdering (and worse) Christians Hollywood liberals pretty much buried this film with a limited release, what we used to call ""straight to video"".  I don't know the story of how it got made, but that in itself is miraculous and it deserves your support. Butler conveys the magnetic, broken, tortured Childers with utter conviction. This is not an easy film to watch, I had to break it up over several days. It is a thousand times better than that pile of dung ""Unbroken"" (though that story was equally worth telling).

4676696,5,B005FITIF0,"I had never heard of Sam Childers or Machine Gun Preacher movie until a couple of weeks ago when vacationing in Evergreen, Colorado. Childers was preaching at a local church and my friend and I were  planning to hear him preach but my friend got sick and we missed the service. Later at lunch who should take a table right next to ours--- none other than Sam Childers the Machine Gun Preacher. I recognized him from a photograph in a church bulletin that prompted me to want to hear him speak in the first place. We had a wonderful conversation lasting more than an hour. I got to know him personally and I believe he is the real deal!

He invited my friends and I to his trailer where he carries his motorcycles (I ride some myself) and gave me us a copy of the movie, ""Machine Gun Preacher"". I was captivated by the movie and I shared my experience with my Sunday school class the next weekend.

Gerard Butler did a credible job of playing Sam Childers in the movie. Sam is a complex man and much of what was presented in the movie was factual but not everything. Sam told me the time line was not correct and that he never experienced a lack of faith as was indicated in the movie nor did he serve time in prison as an adult. He did spend time in jail as a juvenile but was never imprisoned on felony or drug charges. This guy burned the candle at both ends through violent acts and serious drug addictions which developed from the time he was 11 years old until his 30""s. before accepting Jesus Christ and accepting His unconditional forgiveness for his sins and that transformed his life. His story is raw, shocking and uncompromising.

This movie opened my eyes to the transitivity of life for children in the Sudan. You will not come away unaffected. Although the language is rough and there is a sexual scene (mild by Hollywood standards) I became absorbed by this man's commitment to what he feels he is called to do---rescue and care for  victimized children ---rescuing them from their captors at great personal risk.

Starting out with only a handful of rescued children he established a single orphanage which has grown to six orphanages that feed and care for over 4000 orphan children daily. Let there be no doubt that this man has made many personal sacrifices to create a safe haven  for helpless children who would probably not have survived the deplorable conditions in which they were forced to live. There are children today being sold into slavery and human trafficking by their captors. Sam admits that his efforts have saved a few but there are countless others at risk every day. ""I will never be able to save them all but I pray that I will be able to continue to help as many as I can""

I would recommend that you buy and/or see the movie first and then watch the numerous interviews with Sam on Youtube to get the actual facts. I would also recommend the ""Machine Gun Preacher Documentary"" that was recently produced featuring the real Machine Gun Preacher---Sam Childers.",1435708800,,3000,4.532347504621072

Yes, Childers was a really bad man, who became GOD's warrior messenger.  If the film is accurate, Childers is the definitive example of commitment.  Yet, he seemed unable to appreciate the demands he made of his wife & daughter---the sacrifices they were forced to make at his behest.  Except for the phone call home, answered by ""Bug"" (where they played the rhyming game), there's no indication Childers understood he almost lost his family.  Wish the restoration with his wife & daughter had been fleshed out more.

Mankind are made to subdue and have dominion over the earth with the image and likeness of God but today's Christian pastors just want an easy life.

I think that the trips back and forth between Africa and the US were a bit choppy and could have used some more transition. The real meat and potatoes of this movie was in the African scenes, while the scenes in the US could have used more development. Overall I love this movie; it left me motivated and ready to take up action. If only the plot were not so choppy and the end so abrupt, this movie would have gotten 5 stars from me hands down. I will give it 4 stars because the acting of Gerard Butler was impressive for what he was given to work with and because of the call to action I felt from the movie experience as a whole.",1433203200,,776,4.145695364238411

The protagonist also presents a fairly unsavory preoccupation with violence that instead of being celebrated should be treated as a symptom of PTSD.

I dislike violent movies but this was done in such a way that it wasn't in your face yet the point was made. Kudos to this man who has done so much to save the innocent. Be sure to read the statistics at the end of the film. In response to a reviewer who rated it after only 15 minutes watching it, that's ridiculous and brings down the overall rating; the beginning was a bit much but necessary to show the background of the main lead; also, in response to another viewer who said it would have been good if they had cleaned it up, same answer. To watch movies based on violence for the sake of entertainment, in my opinion is a waste of time and harmful to the soul; but if the scenes are pertinent to the storyline, especially when it's based on actual events, then they need to be included.",1432944000,3,894,4.233918128654971

Overall message that someone can become better and try to help people is inspiring.  There's no faith with their hands clean.  People are on all sides and people are fallible.  I hope the best for Africa and this movie helps bring attention to their suffering.  As a Shia Muslim, I think all people are good and all faiths have their purity and people's sincerity counts but hopefully this message is not confused with extremism.  What Christians have done is a whole lot worst than what Muslims have done but none of them will be saved because a crime is a crime no matter who commits it.

and helped me break free of self imposed purposes and check myself for similar self distructive machine gun preacherism  and keep my eye on the price.

Because even though we might not understand whats going on with our little 3% cerebral capacity im sure the Great Architect/Divine Creator is well aware of even the nano details so all the events that might seem cruel to us humans I now withhold judgement till i know all the facts or eliminate judgement altogether and not let my brain fill in the blanks with presumptions as the human brain does leading to inevitable self destruction and disrespect GOD by pretty much saying ur not doing a good job so im a do it for u
In my own way ive been the machine gun preacher but now i will maintain my focus on preventing criminal behavior and drugs and all the after effects before all the fatherless aimless homelesschildren hit 14 and give them the opportunity to show them and lead by example that the american dream is still alive in the Greatest fu&*in Country the World US of A baby",1432339200,,1069,4.533678756476684
4677367,1,B005FITIF0,I can't believe there are so many positive reviews for this movie. The story telling was painfully drawn out and repetitive. The only thing that kept me watching until the end were the ridiculous scenes of a completely untrained biker gang preacher waving his machine gun around taking out dozens of soldiers. I know when I go into a war zone I want to be led by a former meth head with a savior complex. The entire movie we were either bored or laughing that scenes straight out of a Rambo movie were in what is supposedly a true story.,1432252800,,537,4.38
4677368,1,B005FITIF0,"This movie has too much Jesus! It was extremely boring for me. I love action, guns, blood, kicks and laughs, so I tried to watch this one since I really like Gerard Butler, but couldn't take the cheesy religious lines any more and quit the movie. It's actually worse than having a religious person telling me about their imaginary friends and imaginary places. Waste of talent Gerard!",1432252800,,384,4.746268656716418
4677369,5,B005FITIF0,"I am always looking on Amazon to see what might be a good Movie to watch.. I've passed over this a few times, but decided to watch it.  Even though it is 4 years later, this Movie is now firmly planted in my top 5 favorite movies.  Yea, the acting was good, Some very disturbing scenes, but the hard fact is that it was not some plot that was made up, but an actual true story.  This is one of those stories that you don't hear very often about, a drug addict, drinking ex-con who found God and then God used him to become hope for 1000's of Children in Sudan.  I would also suggest you watch the documentary of Sam, also here on Amazon..  I was glued to the screen just waiting for the ""what's going to happen next""..
Excellent movie for those that like the story of someone who hits bottom, but then fights their way back.  And to Sam, the world needs more people like you, Fearless and unshaken from their cause.  That is how change happens.",1432252800,5,944,4.211111111111111

It's a true story that's not finished being written yet but the movie gives enough to enable people to see that he's not going to stop his mission. Some movies like this simplify and beautify realities he faces, just to make the movie marketable. Other make it so syrupy that it could be replaced with a ""Save the dogs"" commercial with mood music, or get an offering plate passed with each viewing of the movie. Not this. It wasn't preachy. Didn't overtly try to make the viewer cry. It was real, and the horrors those kids face should make you cry.

4677943,3,B005FITIF0,"...I'm very hesitant to do reviews on 'plight' movies. Why? Because the subject matter is very serious and very controversial; Save The Whales, HIV Awareness, Ebola Epidemic, the drastic change thats happening in our own country over racism as I write this, murder and terror in Kenya...Very serious subjects that ALL need immediate attention and action. But to make a MOVIE out of these horrible occurrences just feels...wrong...to me. I think Hollywood will defend themselves by saying they are using cinema to bring the atrocities into the light of awareness. Well unless every red cent made off this movie was sent to the main character to honestly HELP THESE CHILDREN...well...I'll just leave that as an open ended statement. This movie is stark and in your face, no happy happy here. The amazing fortitude the character (the real life 'Machine Gun Preacher') shows as he  rises up out of a wasteful criminal existence to find religion and find a REAL purpose, a VITAL purpose in saving the lives of these children is so intense and eye opening that it's truly hard to watch. I feel like these types of subject matter needs to be DEALT with, not put on display at the box office. What's next, Ferguson gone wild? Or perhaps, cancer sufferers Do Dallace!? The only reason I am reviewing a film I feel is somewhat exploitive is because I am a huge fan of Gerard Butler or I wouldn't review this movie at all. His portrayal as King Leunitus in the film 300 is one of my favorite performances by ANY male actor... ever. I will probably get quite a few 'negs' for this review, and I try to slip by and leave these sensitive subjects alone, but when I've been requested to do one, I do. It's what I'm expected to do as a reviewer. I hate doing bad reviews. I want to give everyone five stars, but that's not always possible. The performance by Gerard? Five stars. Exploitive presentation, knocks two stars off...Oh, and that real life ""Machine gun Preacher? He's still out there...struggling. Risking his life. Children are starving and dying. I wonder if HOLLYWOOD plans to do a sequel? Mr. Butler, as one of your biggest fans, I believe your heart is in the right place, and I know you didn't get famous or make a killing doing this role, but this kind of subject matter is too horrible to be relegated to some theatre. This should be an emergency documentary being blasted at NATO enclaves and world outreach organizations, FEMA programs etc. Etc. Not played by actors and stylized, censored, and made palpable for public viewing. People should be getting sick to the very core of their moral fiber. Not writing reviews about it.",1430265600,,2631,4.719565217391304

I realize that many that gave a bad review don't know it is based on a real man's life but the fact is; many things unpleasant happen in life. In the case of Sam Childers; the man wasn't a saint by any stretch of the imagination. This isn't a movie for bible thumping morons that can't handle sex or violence or gawd forbid; their hero to be less than perfect; because he surely isn't.
But the story is heartfelt and the acting well done. I would have given it five stars if the story would have been a bit better produced. I give Butler five stars for jumping into the acting of a born again Christian with serious issues and thought it was well played by him. I also wish they had fleshed out the characters of his wife and daughter more. It would have been more appealing to the masses I think. Still it's very much worth watching with a great message for anyone that takes the time to.

4678218,5,B005FITIF0,"Gerard Butler has evicted me from my life with his powerful and commanding portrayal of Sam Childers, the Machine Gun Preacher. I will never again be the same person I was before viewing this masterpiece.  I felt pain, outrage, horror, anger, disgust and finally despair -- thinking that all these horrors will not change any time soon..

The one thing I did not feel was complacent.  I feel I should DO SOMETHING after seeing the everyday horrors experienced by these young African orphans, but I don't quite know what that ""Something"" should be.  I want to feel comfortable in my life again, but I don't know how to get there.  I felt a strong need to donate to their cause.  For those of you who view this movie and want to help, Sam Childers does have a Facebook page with information on how to donate to their cause.

This movie is NOT for the faint of heart.  It is very visceral in it's portrayal of the true circumstances of the orphans in Sudan.  I finished watching the movie several hours ago and have felt ""unsettled"" ever since.  Expect to feel a lot of very strong emotions erupting within yourself while viewing this movie!!!

As a mother, I'm outraged that one evil man (Joseph Kony, the leader of the L.R.A.) continues to be the cause of so much human damage, yet no one seems to be able to put an end to his violence and madness.  Kony, in my opinion, is the reincarnation of Hitler.  I can only hope Kony meets with the same end!!!  No one deserves it more.",1429228800,,1476,4.438661710037175

Yes, there is coarse language, but the movie is showing a real human man's transition. It wouldn't be realistic without the rough beginning.

Gerard Butler's performance is perfect. I was wondering how he'd handle the accent, but it was a non-issue. He really brought it and showed Childers' passion.",1428192000,,612,4.932038834951456

After that, it shows two things:  his passion for helping the children of war, and two, the fact that he fails just like the rest of us Christians and then rises again and again to his faith, regardless of his human failings (don't we all).

Gerard Butler nailed it.  His eyes, his expressions within his eyes.... I am not sure anyone else could have done this part.  Or at least done it justice.  The viewer can feel his pain, happiness, rage, love, and sacrifice.  The viewer can also feel the stress it places on his family.

This is a real movie, it is gritty and real.  The children will make your tears flow and your heart sink.  The love the man showed for them will make your heart want to do more to help.

4678898,1,B005FITIF0,"Machine Gun Preacher (Marc Forster, 2011)

Marc Forster directed Quantum of Solace, to date my least favorite James Bond movie. Still, even that did not prepare me for the jaw-dropping idiocy that was Machine Gun Preacher. Even better, checking Forster's IMDB page shows that as of this writing he's also got a TV movie called Hand of God in pre-production. Two questions immediately come to mind. 1. When did Marc Forster find Jay-zus? (And how, if he has, was he enticed to direct the decidedly non-evangelical World War Z between the two?) 2. What in the flying hell possessed him to go back to the most ridiculous excesses of eighties-era evangelical film, rather than following farther down the road taken by more recent Christian filmmakers like Robby Henson (Thr3e) and Rafal Zielinski (Hangman's Curse)? Because those guys are making movies that are at least bearable even if you're a non-Christian. This is fund-raising, altar-call claptrap that has all the sincerity of The Cross and the Switchblade without any of the talentwhich is pretty impressive given Forster behind the camera and the roster he put in front of it. Coriolanus aside, I should know better than to watch anything with Gerard Butler's name on it.

Plot: as we open, Sam Childers (Butler) is a biker. He's being released from prison and on his way home. When he gets there, he finds that his wife Lynn (Gone Baby Gone's Michelle Monaghan) has gotten religion, and has the expected reactionheading out to the usual bar to meet up with his old friend Donnie (Take Shelter's Michael Shannon) to do some drinking and drugging. As expected, Sam has his own come-to-Jesus moment not long after, and not only gets himself into the church, but pulls Donnie out of the life too, hallelujah and amen. Fast-forwarding through the slow bits, Childers is inspired by a preacher who comes to his church to go over to Uganda and do a bit of carpentry work. While he's there, he befriends Deng (Keep the Lights On's Souleymane Sy Savane), a Sudanese Liberation Army member who acquiesces to Childers' request to go see some country, taking him into war-torn south Sudan, where warlord Joseph Kony holds sway. As is the case with such things, Childers is inspired to set up shop in Sudan, building a church and an orphanage there, all the while seeming to not realize that the addiction that previously drove him to his drinking and drug excesses has simply found new roots in service.

I will give the movie one thing: Forster and screenwriter Jason Keller (Escape Plan) never once flinch from portraying Childers as not a great guy, and when his devotion to service hits the same bottom as his last hellraising with Donnie, Butler portrays Childers as a true monster; it's the only time I've seen him on a screen other than in Coriolanus where I've been impressed with his acting abilities. (IMDB's trivia section notes that Childers uses the film as a fundraising tool on his speaking tours. They also note that the version shown in churches is heavily edited. One wonders how much of the editing has to do with the language and how much with the darker parts of Childers' character as portrayed by Butler.) The problem is that while the movie goes to great lengths to portray itself as one of those newfangled Thr3e-style movies that's edgier than the stuff turned out by the Kirk Cameron patrol (and before),  this is a case of the script following the letter of the law, not the spirit. This is as Old Time Gospel-y as any of those horrible movies I used to see in the lobby of the Assemblies of God church I attended in the mid-eighties, just with added violence and some cursin'.

4678900,5,B005FITIF0,"A very powerful, heartfelt movie. God is shown to save everybody, especially sinners. Sinners of ALL sizes, shapes and types. A must see movie.",1400630400,,143,5.0
4678901,5,B005FITIF0,"This was an excellent story and a superb acting job by Gerard Butler, and is based on the true story of Sam Childers.  Sam was a reformed bad guy, and seemed to be pretty bad in his time, as you will see in the very beginning of the film.

The film begins in Sudan in 2003, showing a village being raided, burned, and whole families being butchered.  Then we flip back a few years to a town in Pennsylvania, USA, where Sam (Butler) is being released from prison.  He lives with his wife, daughter and mother.  He is nasty, his language is bad, he is involved with drugs and robbery, and has a real nasty temper.  One day, he decides to find Jesus, and begins going to church with his family, turning his life completely around.  He starts working in construction, and when he hears a Pastor from the Christian Ministries in Uganda speak, he decides he wants to go over there and help out for a couple of weeks.

As you might guess, Sam gets caught up in the needs of many young children who cannot even sleep at night because ""Death Comes at Night in the Villages.""  All of this, in a land far away, that most of us will never see.  It is a wonderful story of a man who completely changes his life for the better, and in the process, makes a huge difference in the lives of many others.  His life proves that God does not only call certain people, but needs folks from all walks of life to carry his message of peace and love.  It also reminds us of the simple freedoms and necessities that many of us take for granted (toilets, food, being able to sleep at night, games, just being outside).  As of this movie, Sam lives today in Pennsylvania, still carrying out his activities and you will see pictures of Sam during the very end of the movie.

Wonderful movie, but not for the young children.  Lots of death, destruction, drugs, and crime.",1400457600,,1842,4.329446064139941
4678902,4,B005FITIF0,"I wonder why this movie had such limited release in theaters.  Though it is a difficult movie to watch, it is outstanding.  One of Gerard Butler's best roles and a real showcase for his ability.  There were really two stories to tell, the main one being the appalling plight of children  in Sudan.  However, Sam's conversion is probably worth a movie in it's own right.  That journey is only touched upon here.  Nevertheless, this is movie worth watching for it's truth, it's story and it's acting.",1399939200,2,498,4.72093023255814

4679011,5,B005FITIF0,"This is a great movie. And a true one. It's not for the family with little kids though. It's a bloody movie and it's true to life. So all the Christians who want a whitewashed version of history  should not watch this probably. But if you want the true story of a man who tries to do right and then becomes a war leader then this one is for you.  And it must be pointed out that the preacher doesn't kill people until his orphanage is attacked. He has no choice in the matter. Some Christians would have just died there and not fought back , which is their choice and very brave too, but then all the kids would die.  The acting is great in this flick and the lead actor really begins to chow how war brutalizes the preacher , until he comes back from the brink.  The war scenes are brutal and the fact remains that the international community  needs to help the Sudanese fight the madman koney and his army of death.

4679035,5,B005FITIF0,"Machine Gun preacher is a great eye opening movie. It's amazing how many people know nothing about the evil that takes place in parts africa (specifically Nigeria and Sudan). This movie shows how the lord can take a sinner and transform him into a servant that helps others and is willing to give up everthing in service.

For those who judge fighting fire with fire to protect children, I would ask you to look in the mirror and ask yourself what you would do to protect your child. What have you done to help the children in Africa? This man sold his business and left his family to put himself in harms way for the sake of helping children everyone else seems to have forgot about.",1375142400,2,684,4.428571428571429

The goofy title almost kept me from watching it and then the incredibly rough beginning also nearly caused me to turn it off, but I had a few friends tell me it was a good movie that was inspirational and so I made it through that and sure enough, I wound up really liking this movie.  It made me want to make more of a difference with my own boots on the ground (i.e., heading to Oklahoma to help the Tornado victims and such).  Any movie that stirs me to action is a very good movie.  I would've given it 5 stars, but it is obvious that they were working with a fairly restricted budget - but still a very good movie).

It was so graphic, with violence, sex, drugs and heavily foul language at the beginning, my family and I could not bare to watch past the first 10 minutes.  Give me a break - this guy says the F-word like in every sentence.  ""Fudge"" or something cleaner would have done the trick.

I am so disappointed, I may throw the box out so that no one else has to be subjected to this way too realistic movie.  Can't they make a movie with a cleaner, PG-rated script?  We can get the point without the realistic language and action.

Sorry to say, I cannot recommend this movie, even if the end of the movie is good.  It's too much for this born-again Christian and family.",1373414400,4,834,4.363636363636363

I was very dissapointed with the movie because it felt like the movie was constructed very poorly. Gerard Butler goes from being this outlaw biker dude to being this almost creepishly obsessive religious guy. The movie was moving very slow and I just was not able to continue watching because there was nothing happening. The movie had no flow, and scenes were just inserted, having no cohesion.

Warning: If you're expecting something sugar-coated and religious, the first half-hour will make you wonder where it's all going. It will offend your sensibilities if you haven't been on the other side of the tracks. This movie is as real as it gets in portraying how a low-life with skills in street fighting and doping, found God had something better. It doesn't show a man achieving perfection. It shows a man that saw a desperate need that few cared about and jumped in to help. A lot was said about Darfur, Sudan  by the celebrities of our day. But except for this former biker, Franklin Graham and maybe George Clooney and his dad; few have actually DONE anything.
Go ahead and watch this. It will give you an emotional roller-coaster ride and it will show you how one imperfect person can make a world of difference when they care enough to risk doing something.",1367798400,3,1032,4.578378378378378

4679122,3,B005FITIF0,"I admire director Marc Forster a lot, especially after the brilliant ""Finding Neverland"". He seems to long for the appreciation of misunderstood persons, and is usually successful. His James Bond effort left me a little baffled, but ""Machine Gun Preacher"", despite its crazy title, just didn't work for me. I'm thinking the main problem was Gerard Butler, who was either hot or sweet, and there wasn't much grey area. Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon were reliable in their respective roles, but our protagonist was never really convincing as a good person.

The plight of the poor kids was the most interesting element, but everything else about the film left me wanting more. Mr Childers may be a fine man, but standing beside a church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a field makes you a farmer. Childers' transformation was superficial, at best, and needed more explanation to make this viable to a thinking person.

I saw a film about a confused, misdirected guy who was looking for his next rush. He didn't seem to know how to be his own man.",1365724800,,1075,4.805405405405406

You can see and feel his emotions of caring, anger, and confusion, hurt and heartache.  When he looks at Lynn at one point and says, Help me, it just broke me up,, you could see the pleading on his face..........There is nothing he can't accomplish in his acting career.....................look at all his movies and how he plays serious, comedy,  romantic (even when a bad guy),evil, villaneous, hero like,  and can also sing - did a wonderful job in Phantom............This movie was watched twice and I just bought it....and I will watch it over and over..........a most excellent film and actor/actors!",1365638400,3,918,4.808917197452229

It does show what the power of God can do to change a life and the difference one determined individual can make in this world.

Based on the tacky title, I expected ""Machine Gun Preacher"" to fall into that category; but actually, apart from the gore and fact that Butler's character is generally amoral and loathsome, it's a good movie.

Butler is a junky drug dealer who, after nearly killing a man in a fit of rage, finds religion through the faith of his devoted wife.  Because he is fundamentally an obsessive person, he takes his new beliefs to an extreme, traveling to Africa to help dispossessed orphans.  He is deeply moved by the plight of these children, but an inherently violent man, it doesn't take long before he is militaristically embroiled in a veritable war in Africa.  His initially heroic stance becomes increasingly paranoid and borderline evil, and eventually he is little better as a man than his enemies.

Butler is a sensitive performer under his muscle suit, and he portrays his growing awareness of his own flaws with depth and eloquence.  This is based on a true story, unbelievable as the movie may be; but it is Butler and the children of Africa who elevate it to something special and moving.

Please get past the exploitive title and watch ""Machine Gun Preacher"".  In the final analysis, it's a meaningful film.",1360454400,,1299,4.841628959276018

This drives him to sobreity and to being baptised into the faith, he then makes his own contracting business, builds his family a proper house, and builds a church that he has to be pastor of. Childers then goes to Southern Sudan and is so enraged at the horrors heaped on the populaces children forced to serve as child soldeirs that he builds an orphanage for them and starts doing rescue ops to retreive children from the Sudanese muslims. Childers garners a reputation from the people as being enchanted and commanding great power, but his actions start to take a toll on his sanity and relationships with his family and freinds.

Sam Childers has such passion for saving these beautiful children.  Children who have been violated in some of the worst ways imaginable.  It's not a typical Hollywood movie thats full of action.  This movie is real and it's raw, and it's about redemption.  Sam and Lynne Childers have sacrificed everything for this cause, including placing their lives in danger.  The Bible says, the greatest love of all is to lay your life down for another, which is what Sam Childers is doing.  I pray that God keep each and every person involved in this cause safe ,from Joseph Kony and the LRA, from the savagery and destruction they create in their reign of terror.  As for the acting, Gerard Butler WAS Sam Childers in this film.  He played his part to perfection.  Michelle Monoghan and Michael Shannon were superb, as well.

4679196,5,B005FITIF0,"Every time I watch this movie, I am stirred by the way God worked in him. I am also brought to a clearer realization of my own selfishness. This movie, better than any other movie I have seen (I regularly watch Christian movies)brings me face to face with my selfishness regarding seeking comfort and concerning not being a good steward of the money God has given me to manage.
I don't agree with many things I saw in the movie. I think, however, that God is using it to move me, so that is good.
I respect Sam's courage and his conviction. I used to work with violent youth and recognize how important it is for children to have a safe environment, and Sam was all about providing this most basic human need. I didn't like the way he preached, he seemed to be all about works, but I really can't know whether the movie correctly portrayed his life or not. And we are all growing in our faith as we walk.... I do think that his killing of the LRA was appropriate. And that the female medic was harsh in her evaluation of him.
He entered into the most chaotic and violent situation when he joined forces with the freedom fighters, I applaud their accomplishments. I hope the hang in until Kony and his men are brought to nothing. I also pray that Sam is concerned with teaching those children the gospel.

I especially like the speech Sam gives the banker when the banker tells him he can't lend him any more money...  Again, Sam finds a way to help the children of Sudan.  The movie is graphic but realistic; the children have suffered horrifically yet they are still kind, gentle souls; and children are forced to kill by the leaders of the LRA.

Don't just watch this movie for entertainment; it really does share the woes of life in Africa.  It is a life lesson and really makes me appreciate what missionaries are doing for those who cannot help themselves.

As a South African I can identify with the events, the central ideas and message of the film, these are events everyone struggle to talk about and to describe. Tens millions have been killed like that but things are much better now than what they were in the 1970s and 1980s, when these events were widespread, but today some areas are still unstable, especially some parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. No amount of political and military influence is able to stop the violence, whether US, Chinese, South African or UN.

Western countries owe a debt of gratitude to a number of African groups that continue to sacrifice their people, sometimes millions to fight and fend off certain groups, in order to secure important natural resources for Western and Eastern businesses and to keep certain terrorist groups from acquiring control over the natural resources. South Africans especially owe Mozambicans a debt of gratitude whose country lost about a million civilians in wars and South Africa is consequently helping to rebuild Mozambique, which has seen 7% GDP growth per year over the past 20 years. Google Between 1994 and 2006, average annual GDP growth was approximately 8% for Mozambique.

My wife commented that it is almost unanimous among her and her peers that the f___ word is the least socially acceptable. That is likely why it was chosen as Sam's favorite swear word, to express which side of the tracks he came from, the fact that he was a social outcast and he didn't care who knew it. The inclusion of such offensive material was most likely considered valuable to the story to depict a nitty gritty portrait of Sam Childers.

***WARNING - SPOILER ALERT***
The story is about Sam's hour of reckoning in a life of violence, drugs, prison and drunkenness and him finding redemption. It is about him responding to God's grace by planting a church, where other bikers would feel welcome, and starting an orphanage in war torn Sudan, where the LRA terrorize children with unspeakable horrific acts. With a machine gun and a truck he sets out to rescue these children. It would have been a great heart warming story if it would have ended there, but Sam soon discovers that he can't save everyone and then wonders why God doesn't. This causes a downward spiral of anger, frustration and desperation.
***END OF SPOILER***

Film directors seem to have such a difficult time projecting people's spiritual life, Machine Gun Preacher is no better. Sam's devotional life plays a key role in the unfolding drama, and yet we have little to go on which makes it a cut and paste job that leaves the viewer filling in the gaps. Perhaps if more attention was given to this, it would have been easier to identify with the character instead of being repulsed and detached by his eruption of angry outbursts. Even Christian minsters have to learn how to deal with their emotions. Self-control is a fruit of the spirit and a continual daily struggle. Patience, long-suffering and the like are tempered by steadfast devotion to God, through spiritual discipline such as prayer and Bible reading. Christian directors have a lot more work to do in portraying this aspect of the soul. Meanwhile, hard edged films like this will hopefully inspire better and more serious material in the future.

While Amazon's editorial review states that the movie is a fictional look, I know for a fact that there are true stories that are quite similar to this one, where God has totally revolutionized murderous drug dealing thugs, turning them into soft-hearted ministers that literally lay down their lives to share the love of Jesus with others, not only in America but all across the world. I've met many of them, too many to count. From The Cross and the Switchblade to Machine Gun Preacher, their stories need to be told. The Gospel changes lives!",1355702400,2,2870,4.759036144578313

If such things don't bother you, you may enjoy this film more than we did. It really helps to open your eyes to things going on in the world that we would all rather forget.  It is worth seeing for that alone. It is not a feel good movie about a biker gangster coming to Jesus and then changing the world.

I would recommend this movie not just for its uplifting faith but for the reality of the struggles of faith when faced with overwhelming suffering and the determination to act to help.  The main characters are not perfect people; you see the struggles they have with faith throughout the movie.  And there are still people in refugee camps around the world that need our help!",1352764800,2,819,4.582191780821918
4679365,5,B005FITIF0,"Machine Gun Preacher follows Sam Childers as he changes his life from a vicious gang biker to a hopeful and helpful preacher. His journey to save the children of Sudan from the LRA (Kony) is powerful and motivational.

First, the story is very emotional and effective; it shows how Childers changed his life, through religion, for the better and if shows the atrocities that have occurred and continue to occur in Sudan. And, although religion is a significant part of the film, Machine Gun Preacher does not force religion on to the audience, which I think some viewers will appreciate. This is the type of film that can make you happy for a moment, and make you sad, or even cry, the next moment; for example, watching the kids play soccer with a baseball as Childers tried to teach them to play was heartwarming; conversely, watching a young boy chase after his dog and accidentally hit a explosive was heartwrenching. The film also works as an action film as it uses some intense action/shootout sequences to push the story along. Gerard Butler, as Childers, was brilliant. Michael Shannon, as Donnie, was also excellent, despite his limited screen time. The music was also great, and the film was shot beatifully.

Overall, Machine Gun Preacher is a brilliant film with a powerful message. As of 11/12/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.

Machine Gun Preacher has strong violence and gore (including graphic violence towards children), and a brief sex scene. (no nudity, but you can see the movements)",1352678400,,1562,4.909090909090909

Its mind boggling how this didn't get more publicity.  I watched Hunger Games last night and its mind boggling how that movie got so much hype.  Butler did a great job in this movie.

4679482,3,B005FITIF0,"I've always been a fan of Gerard Butler. Most found him interesting when he starred front and center on both PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and 300. I think he's been good not only in those films but the ones most right off as being bad like THE BOUNTY HUNTER and THE UGLY TRUTH. It takes a good actor to make a bad movie enjoyable and Butler has done so. His latest isn't a bad movie but he does make it one worth watching.

Butler stars as Sam Childers, a biker about to be released from prison with a drug addiction problem who finds crime the easiest way to make a living. When he's released he returns home to discover that his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has given up her old ways. No longer working as a stripper, she has a respectable job and has found religion. Unhappy with this turn of events, Sam heads out to a bar with his friend and cohort Donnie (Michael Shannon).

On their way home they pick up an Indian hitchhiker who threatens them with a knife. Sam takes the knife from him, stabs him repeatedly and tosses the body out of the car.
Reaching home Sam tries to wash the blood off, horrified at what he has done. With Lynn at his side, she helps him find his way to God.

Sam gets his act completely together. He starts a construction company and when he hears God talking to him builds a church for people like himself, outcasts from society who need a place to pray and find help. He rescues Donnie from the life he was once leading. When he meets a missionary from Africa talking about the atrocities that are going on there, he decides to investigate further.

Heading to the Sudan he sees the effects of the war there on the children of the area. When he gets home he tells Lynn that God has called on him to build a refuge for these children and sets out to do so. Gathering any funds and donations he can, Sam does build the church and orphanage. But the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) who stand against these children and their families take offense and attack his stockade. Picking up a weapon, Sam joins his protectors to run them off and a legend is born.

Keeping the orphanage and church open is not an easy task and Sam is tested time and again for his beliefs. His fighting is rare if at all but that changes one night. On the way home after rescuing several children, Sam comes across a number of children stranded by the roadside. Only able to take so many in his truck, he promises to come back for the rest. By the time he does so he returns to find nothing more but their charring bodies burned by the LRA. This sends him over the edge and from then on he carries a weapon which he uses with more frequency.

There is no real ending to this tale. Based on the true story of the real Sam Childers his fight carries on. During the closing credits we get to see footage of the real Sam as he talks about his journey and shows us the church here at home and in Africa. It is an inspiring story that some will side with and other condemn. Those who think everything must be done to save these children will side with Childers. Those who feel you must turn the other cheek will dismiss it. But once you get into the mind of this man who has sacrificed so much for so many, you won't have a choice but to admire him for who he is and what he accomplished.",1344470400,4,3277,4.218500797448166

4679489,5,B005FITIF0,"Wow. What a great story and the best part is it is true. Butler does an amazing job bringing to life the Sam Childers. The road from a criminal to a man saved and determined to make a difference in the world was very powerful. Some of my favorite moments are simply when Childers wants to see the things in Africa that his church group is being shielded from seeing. Clearly he knows there is more to what is happening over there than just coming into a less hostile area and building shelters. It becomes obvious that this man given a mission by God that he firmly wishes to fulfill.

I did love watching the highs and lows this man endures because you can clearly see that everyone struggles even those who are saved have a struggle. You really get to see this man's take on being a Christian as he protects children from being forced into a life of murder and slavery.

And what I love to see while watching Butler is how beautifully he embraces the character. He seems to really become the character.",1344297600,2,1004,4.39247311827957

4679502,4,B005FITIF0,"Here's a movie I wanted to see from the first time I heard about it. Had made plans to see this in theaters when it was released last fall. It's opening was dwarfed by the simaltaneous opening of Christian movie juggernaut Courageous. Plus, it's limited release meant only major cities even had the film playing. Plans fell through with a buddy of mine for going downtown (Chicago) to see it, so I decided to wait for the dvd. March came, and I prepaid for the expected June release date. Now, here it is August, and I'm just now watching Machine Gun Preacher. And for me, my mixed journey to watch out seems somewhat reflective of the movie itself.

For starters, it's a story quickly told. If you watch the preview, you've basically seen the movie. Beyond that, I must say it's not a movie you ""like."" It's a movie about real life: with parts that tug on your heart with their life-likeness; others that bewonder you with their clicheness; and of course a few that inspire you with their true story-telling, even if they were done Hollywood.

I don't think this movie is for everyone. The elements of the story seem all too familiar for jaded Western viewing: African orphans, poverty, sole American hero. Even some parts of the story can seem repetitive. But you know what, life can be repetitive. Life can also be inspiring and cliche and heart-tugging. So for that, I applaud Machine Gun Preacher; it really is lifelike.

The real meat of the movie lies in the character development of Sam. His metamorphasis is brilliant. We watch him go from ruthless sinner to saint to near insanity, as he becomes gripped by his cause. I wouldn't have made all the choices Sam did, but then again, thousands of orphans in Africa wouldn't be alive today if Sam acted like I would have. And herein is the beauty of Machine Gun Preacher. It tells its story as it happened: good, bad, and ugly. In that right, it reminds me of an Old Testament account, like that of David or Abraham or Jacob. These men did amazing things for the Kingdom of God and for the communities around them, and yet they have bad marks on their records; they weren't perfect, and the Bible lets us know that. It tells their stories as they happened: good, bad, and ugly...cliche, inspiring, and emotional. Because life is like that. One minute things  are all too familiar with monotony and routine and the next minute everything is different; and even if that same thing has happened to everyone you know, it's new to you because it's the first time it has happened to you. So life can be cliche and yet heart-tugging at the same time. And so can Machine Gun Preacher.

Asthetically, Gerard Butler is clearly the star, and he does a fine job acting. Other notables include: the one little kid with the scar on his face and Gerard's wife. Most of the other character seemed pretty stock for the roles they had to play, and though they did them relatively well, there is nothing worth mentioning. Good cinematography and great musical score too (check out Revival by Soulsavers). The first twenty minutes or so has some rough scenes, so be forewarned. Also, there are several violent scenes showing the African warzones and its victims throughout the film. Nothing is gratuitous though some of it is very graphic.

Best line in the movie is when Sam, the main character, reflects on the violence and suffering in Sudan: ""I'm scared that one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem.""

All in all, the film is worth one watch; not a lot of replay value, perhaps a second and third viewing only to fully appreciate the character development (or to keep your heart stirred if you're wired that way).

4679507,3,B005FITIF0,"There are numerous things wrong with this movie beginning with the title (sounds like something Tarantino or Rodriquez would make) and ending with its 2+ hour length.  There's also plenty right, perhaps beginning and ending with bringing attention to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent people on the African continent.

You never know how much of the depicted events of a ""true"" story really happen but the overview seems uncontested.  Gang member and heroin addict Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is released from a prison stint to find that his wife (Michelle Monaghan) has retired from her lucrative pole dancing career to work as a clerk.  It seems she has found Jesus and has been reborn.  After a hellish night on smack where Sam and his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) nearly kill a hitch hiker, Sam also sees the light.

After Sam's conversion he has 2 missions.  One is to build a church and nursery in his eastern Pennsylvania community and second, to help the people of northern Uganda and southern Sudan which is being overrun by the Lord's Resistance Army headed by the vile Joseph Kony.  When Sam has some success in Pennsylvania, he underestimates the violence and political issues in Africa.  He has problems raising money, so begins to borrow against his house and eventually sells his successful construction business.  Sam slips off the deep end often.  Too often for my liking.  Still, Lynn (Monaghan) and his daughter (Madeline Carroll) stick with him even though his violent rages and financial malfeasance would usually bring on a lawyer at some point.

This is where the director (Marc Forster) and writer (Jason Keller) seem to get carried away as well.  To their credit, however they don't shy away from the violence and unspeakable horrors that transpire to this day in east Africa.  Some absurdities aside, the film moves quickly and is technically well made.

The 1080p transfer is generally well done and consistent with recent movies.  I did notice a bit of flickering on the opening scene but that may have been an aberration.  Overall the contrast is quite good and some of the African landscape is well presented.  The film is shot in 2.40:1 aspect ratio which is carried over here.  Although I don't talk about it much above, the film has numerous scenes of gun battles including automatic weapons, rockets and bombs.  This is well layed out across the 5.1 channels all presented in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.",1343606400,2,2465,4.934466019417476
4679508,5,B005FITIF0,"So tonight I watched a film that I had been really wanting to watch, but yet at the same time I was putting off seeing.

Now I know that is an oxymoron but it is truth.  And it is a great depiction of this film as well.

The movie was ""Machine Gun Preacher"" the story of Sam Childres.

You can read multiple different reviews on this film.  It was very controversial since it was a story of FAITH but rated R and filled with violence.

In the first 10 min's the film would turn any Christian watching it for Christian Values (Or at least make them blush).  From the on screen, yet not visible, sex in a car to extreme profanity, violence and alcohol and Drug abuse scenes... yet all these items are in context and are used to build the Character of the man.

This man who was a biker gang member who upon getting out of jail finds his wife had gone `religious'.  Yet in a turn of events he realizes there has to be something more and in a non-dramatic scene we find him believing and being baptized.  There weren't angels, there weren't shouts from him but a sort of groggy sense of awe.

We again see that same feeling when he arrives back from a trip to Northern Uganda to help with construction of a mission.  He, unlike the other members, wanted to see the truth of the war.  And did he ever...  His soon to be friend Deng took him to a village where the children would come each night in order to not be abducted.

Finally he senses God's call to build an orphanage and a Church.  One in American and one in Sudan.  This is the story of the trials and floods that he goes against.  You will be pulled into the reality of this war that has been waged for 30+ years and that has taken the lives of over 400,000 people.  You will feel his anguish, his hurt, and his anger.

There were two parts of this movie that moved me the most outside of the general message of Orphan care that you all know is my passion.

First: When he is arriving back in the states after his monumental first trip.  You see on his face the unspoken emotion of one whose world has just been changed.  I have been there.  From my first visit to a squatters village in Mexico, or a small tribal village in Guatemala; but most vividly in the post earthquake Haiti where orphans begged for water on every street corner; where bodies are still being found among the ruble...  I understood this vague look of heartache.

Second: we watch as Sam's story progress' and eventually we see what happens to most of us who become passionate about something.  We come up against opposition and we want to quit.  Sam didn't; but once he kept going he began to see others who didn't understand his passion, or share his passion as unworthy of being called Christians.  His passion became the only true passion of Christ instead of one means of showing God's passion.

I would HIGHLY recommend this film to all of you who wish to learn more about what one man is doing in Sudan/Uganda.  I do not recommend it for those who are easily offended.  This Machine Gun Preacher lives up to his name not only with his gun but with his mouth.

There is a quick note from the Real Sam at the end of the film in the credits that says in essence that I know that I may not have gone about this the best or right way at times... but  ""If a madmen abducted your child or a family member and I said I could bring them home, does it matter how I bring them home?""

So to sum it all up: Don't watch it with the kids.  But don't watch it if you don't want your heart pulled out, trampled on cause you will finish asking yourself (I Hope) What on earth am I doing!!

4679509,1,B005FITIF0,"This movie is about the true story of Sam Childers, a former drug-dealing criminal who eventually ""converted"" to Jesus, became a preacher  and went to mission to Africa in order to help orphans and people in a developing country.
He indeed raised money for the orphans and was the promoter of many humanitarian works, but he did not behave as a Christian.
Throughout the movie, after his ""conversion"", he used violence as a way to achieve his goals, and answered evil with evil, violence with violence disobeying to the Scriptures.
Waching the movie, I had the impression that Sam's attitude had not changed, he used the war in Sudan as an excuse to pour out his rage and violence, twisting the message of Jesus.
Sam's ""mission"" turned into an obsession that almost destroyed his family, a family that he negleted.
Sam's also became violent with his best friend and did not help him when he was in need.

Even though I understand there is a certain time limit to fit in the whole life of Sam Childers in a movie, I still wish they would be able to tell us more about his sudden decision of becoming a Christian, and his initial stage of joy and/or struggles etc before he went on his missions trips. I was hoping to find out more about Sam Childers in the special features, unfortunately they didn't have much footage. Anyhow, it's really touching, and Gerard Butler's performance was just awesome. BRAVO to the producers, very brave in investing in a movie like this, it was't even showing in most of the major cinemas in Hong Kong hence I had to buy it online!",1342656000,2,683,4.472
4679517,5,B005FITIF0,"This movie is probably the best I've seen all year, and it's definitely the best Gerard Butler movie I have ever seen.  This movie was adapted from a book about a real life situation going on in Africa and a man from America dedicating his life to helping the orphaned children there.

Gerard plays Sam Childers, a heroin addicted ex con biker with an attitude, who after killing a man decides to change his ways and go to church.  He then turns it all around and opens his own business and starts his family.  He volunteers for a mission to Sudan and after staying there and seeing all the violence taking place there.  He decides to go back and try to open an orphanage there.  But as you watch the movie you will see all the hardships and torture this man goes through to help these kids.

This movie is action packed and inspiring, it will make you cry as well.  It's simply amazing I don't understand why this movie hasn't gotten more recognition, I haven't heard anyone talking about it.  What makes this movie even more amazing is that this is actually taking place to this day, and they couldn't have found a better guy to play Sam than Gerard in my opinion.

So I highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't easily grossed out by blood and guts and can handle watching child deaths.  It will take your breath away.",1342396800,,1327,4.419753086419753

4679519,3,B005FITIF0,"This is one of the tougher movies I've ever tried to rate. It is entirely due to my difficulty in separating the story from the movie.

Here's the scoop. Sam Childers is a bad guy. We meet him as he's getting out of prison. He's a junkie biker. He has no reservations about inflicting serious pain on people. He wants his wife, who has found Jesus and a respectable job, to go back to being a stripper. After a particularly rough bout with drugs he begins to re-examine his life. He goes straight. Finds a job. Builds a church. Starts a construction company. Goes to the Sudan to help out there and finds he genuinely cares about the lives of those people. He's now on a mission.

This is certainly a great story. Here's a guy who's scraping the bottom of the barrel, turns himself around, and becomes a true, moving force in the lives of a tortured people. But I don't know if the movie itself is all that spectacular. The director, Mark Forster, has had some outstanding movies to his credit. He seemed to want to play this one straight, with little razzle dazzle. But it all seemed too familiar. I felt as though I'd seen most of these scenes before in other movies. There was too little here that was fresh. It was all very professional and tight. You could practically set your watch to it it was so evenly paced. Maybe that was the problem. It needed something to shake loose from the normal.

This is by no means a bad movie and it's easy to watch. During the closing credits the viewer is treated to actual footage of Childers and others depicted in the movie. This is a serious plus. Some might take exception to the Jesus thumping, gun toting point of view, but that's how the story goes. It just needed something to take it to the next level.",1342310400,19,1753,4.387692307692308

4679521,4,B005FITIF0,"I'd seen the trailers and read press releases for this movie. It didn't prepare me at all for what I was about to experience.

Machine Gun Preacher is the story of Sam Childers, fictionalized for a broader audience and appeal. Sam was once an ex-con, drug addict, and all around bad dude.

Upon his release from prison, he finds out his wife had become a Christian. Little did he know how upside down his world was about to become.

Gerard Butler did a fantastic job playing Sam as he went on his journey. You could see the pain in his eyes, the desire to do good, and the destruction it can sometimes bring.

Michelle Monaghan was good as the wife of Sam. She portrayed the hurt and despair as she seen her husband slip further and further away as he attempted to help the children of the Sudan.

I began watching the movie knowing the background and story. Yet I wasn't expecting the language, yes there is quite a bit of swearing, sexuality, and more in the movie. But that was okay. It setup the story and didn't hold back. If you're not okay with hearing and seeing these types of situations, you may have to pass by this convicting movie.

When you watch this movie, I feel you will be changed. You'll see a different side of the world we live in. One where pain and abuse are common place. Few men dare to go there. And yet Sam did.

If you're anything like me, you'll find a renewed, or new, desire to step up and do something about the atrocities happening in our world. That's what I feel the movie set out to accomplish and it did.",1342224000,3,1542,4.314878892733564

4679533,4,B005FITIF0,"This movie falls in between the cracks due to harsh language in the beginning and some gore, and the generally positive (but also critical) portrayal of Christianity on Childers. Plus a reminder of the ongoing atrocities the UN is doing nothng about. That's why it didn't last long in the theaters, I would guess.

Childers is leading a pretty bad life when a traumatic incident makes him realize he has to change. He finds salvation in Christ, and things turn around. He is confronted with the sufferings inflicted by Kony and friends, and goes to the Sudan to do something to help, building an orphanage and feeding the victims.

What do you do when helpless children are being kidnapped and turned into murdering monsters or killed? What do you do when these kidnapping cowards bring the fight to your gates, destroying their safe haven besides?

Childers decides he has to fight back - using bullets and the occasional RPG. And this is what makes this movie interesting. What should he do? What should Christians do? Is ""turn the other cheek"" for when you're slapped, or also when other innocents are being slapped around?

We see his frustration when fellow Christians back home seem indifferent to the horrors he has seen - at least, where their pocketbooks are concerned. He begins to focus on the Sudanese to the neglect of his family. Right or wrong? Is his daughter right to fret over Dad's refusal to spring for a limo for her formal when kids in the Sudan are getting hacked to death and blown up? We are not told if he shares these sufferings with his family; the movie portrays him as keeping it to himself.

One reviewer mentions some scenes thrown in for dramatic effect, such as his crisis of faith, turning instead to himself to solve these problems. I don't know if this is true, but be aware of this possibility.

In the end, it's a powerful, disturbing, and stirring movie. At the very least it may spur you to help financially by donating to organizations such as Angels in Africa.",1341964800,5,2003,4.676136363636363

This movie is based on a true story and Sam Childers is a modern day saint. I strongly recommend this movie,1341878400,,270,4.113207547169812
4679535,5,B005FITIF0,"I first heard about this movie when researching Joseph Kony during the Invisible Children and Kony 2012 mania.

Looking at the reviews of the relatively few people that saw it during its theater release and those being overwhelmingly positive, seeing who was in it and looking at the track record of the companies behind it, I just could not understand why this had such limited exposure.  I also didn't understand why it took exponentially longer for the movie to be released on DVD.

I still don't understand it.

Finally having the opportunity to watch it, it is an incredible movie.  Gerard Butler was outstanding in portraying Sam Childers and the transformation in his life.  You saw him become a different person.

Yes, the beginning is gritty and raw, but that is the way life is.  God saves and transforms, even the vilest.  ""Amazing Grace"" was written by a man,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Newton/dp/0825433193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Newton</a>, who came from similar depths.

I think the movie also does a good job exposing the situation in Southern Sudan and Uganda.

The one thing that I have an issue with is that the writers/director wanted to use the story, but then tried to negate the source of motivation and transformation.  Three fourths of the way through, they portray Childers as losing faith, rejecting God, and doing it on his own power.  Childers said in an interview that it didn't happen.

There is something about the reality of God working in people's lives that Hollywood can't handle and has to try to neutralize.  The same thing happened in the story of C. S. Lewis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadowlands/dp/0783113315/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadowlands</a>.  The writers had to try to completely negate the driving force of Lewis's life, and as a result, they completely failed to capture the essence of who he was.

MGP doesn't go as far as that.  Butler does a much better presentation of Childers than Hopkins did of Lewis.  It does go a little Rambo at the end, maybe overly so.  But I do like during the credits that they show photos of the actual orphanage, Deng, and Childer's wife and daughter.",1341792000,3,2251,5.340909090909091

Hotel Uganda is the closest comparision I can make to this movie. It is very sad that this movie did not go national release instead it was a limited to a few theaters across the united states. This is no B-movie, high quality throughout, and a story that needs to be told.

Joseph Kony is the biggest child murderer in history. Yet because it is Africa no one cares. Feeling sorry for them, saying words of support, that is not enough. If you want to help people, give. Give money, give time. They don't need words, they need action. This is still happening everyday.

4679543,5,B005FITIF0,"I just finished watching this movie a couple hours ago and am still a little shaken by it. Gerard Butler's portrayal and this story are somewhat beyond description. His acting is top notch and the story is as well.

It shows how the real-life Sam Childers goes from a psychotic motorcycle thug to a tried and true freedom fighter for the children in southern Sudan and northern Uganda. It shows his transformation through his new found faith in the Christian religion and the unending support that he receives from his loving wife, daughter, and mother. He goes from robbing crack houses to building up his own successful construction company. He's then inspired by a missionary to go to Africa to ""help"". After his return, he's inspired to do more. He then builds his own church in order to support an orphanage in Sudan.

In the beginning, everything goes really well until ... you know, it doesn't. Then his faith in everything that he believes in is tested. Part of his ""test"" comes when his best friend kills himself after Sam hurts him during a heated argument. Sam goes into a very emotionally dark place where you think that he might become the monster that he was and is now trying to fight in Africa. He's then reenergized by the love and support that he receives from his African friends and the children at the orphanage he runs.

While watching this movie you'll go through every extreme of emotion from joy to dread. Just watching how this guy, by all rights should be dead of Anytown, Pennsylvania, fights for these kids that no one in the world cares about. It makes you wonder that if he can do this with minimal support, what the hell is the UN doing in Africa?

In Machine Gun Preacher he plays Sam, a rough and tumble criminal who is hooked on drugs and upon getting out of jail finds out his wife has found God! She goes to church and supports him no matter what kind of trouble he gets in. I spent half the movie wondering if she was completely in love with him or just dumb. They say that behind every good man is a great woman and her constant support brings him to church where he finds the strength to finally turn his life around. He is Mr. Upstanding citizen helping others and suddenly running to East Africa to help rebuild.  Before you know it he has taken children in and all the kids know him. He comes home and builds a church and travels back to Africa to fight against Joseph Kony's slaughtering army.

Jerry does a great job as usual but like I said, I am a big fan. The story is interesting and at times horrifying even more so knowing it is a true story.  If all it does is entertain that will be the minimum. Hopefully it will draw more to know and hopefully fight against the onslaught of humanity going on around the world. So much innocence lost.

4679563,5,B005FITIF0,"Yes, I knew going into this film that it was based on a true story, but simply watching all the REAL photos and videotape of the REAL Sam Childers in action (back in the day, and quite recently too) I was blown away that Butler had nailed this guy's unrelenting perseverance to a tee! This movie is incredible, you can never take your eyes off of it, and whilst all the time you are waiting for Childers to take a bullet (especially when Kony puts a bounty on his head), there is never really a time when you think he can't survive all that he is given.

The film starts in Sudan in 2003 and shows a village being burnt to the ground, but not before the pilledging, and plundering, and raping, and killing of young and old - all brought about by (the now fugitive) warlord Joseph Kony. We then go back a ""few years earlier"" to Pennsylvania, where Childers (Butler) is getting out of jail. Met by his long-suffering wife, Michelle Monaghan, he soon gets back into his bad ways re: drink, drugs, whoring, and robbing and killing!

She has found The Lord since he was last away, he thinks that's funny, until one night he nearly kills a hitchhiker on the side of the road. Soon he joins her in Church, becomes re-baptised and slowly, but surely Childers takes on a whole new God-empowered persona. He builds his own church across the street from their new house, as now he has his own building contractor company, and when a visiting Pastor comes over from Uganda to tell of the troubles over there too, it's then he knows what he has to do.

And therein falls the last two thirds of this glorious film. Childers invests all his time and efforts into building an Orphanage in Uganda, one that gets burnt down the first time, but not the second. He tries to make the streets safe for the kids (that are everywhere, scattered after the Kony raids), and even joins in when it's time to fight the rebels - hence the term, Machine Gun Preacher.

At the end of the fim, which I won't give away, the credits roll and reveal that Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and 40,00 child abductions alone! And that, to this day, Sam Childers STILL fights for the children of the Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda.

4679566,5,B005FITIF0,"(Contains minimal spoilers, but not much more than the trailer shows)

Violence, Drugs, Alcohol, Obscene Language, and Sex. Just what every sold out, on-fire, Bible-thumping, Christian looks for when they want a good movie. Well, not exactly. When I first saw the trailer for Machine Gun Preacher my first instinct was, ""Great. Another lame attempt to make a Christian movie."" But as I followed a little closer, I began to see that this movie was going to be different--way different.  Machine Gun Preacher is a movie based on the life of Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler of the movie 300), a rough-around-the-edges former biker, former druggie, former convict, former woman abuser, former you-name-it. If you could conjure up something evil in your mind, chances are Sam Childers was involved in it. And the first twenty minutes of the Machine Gun Preacher film demonstrates this quite well. In fact, the movie introduces Sam as he is being released from prison and the very next scene shows Sam having sexual intercourse with his wife in their automobile (no nudity is shown). Next, we hear a battery of F-words uttered by Sam and then we see him belittling (and almost beating) his wife because she is no longer a stripper and has decided to change her life since she met Jesus. The next fifteen minutes or so of the movie can only be described as a hard-core, drug and violence filled drama that would send chills down the spine of every God-fearing Christian with any sense of morality. If I was to review just the first half-hour of this movie, I would say that it is absolutely unfit for anyone to watch. But thankfully that is not the end of this story.

As the movie unfolds a little later, something happens to Sam and he has an encounter with the Lord, is baptized, and his life begins to change. We see Sam living a very different Christian life and loving his wife and daughter like a Christian husband and dad should. Then the moment that changes the film's direction even more comes into play. A missionary from Africa visits Sam's church and Sam is so impacted that he decides to go to Africa himself and volunteer to help build shelter for victims displaced in the region's civil war. But Sam never imagined what he would see on his short journey in war-torn Africa; it is absolutely unnerving to watch even a fictional version of what really happened...

For example, Sam sees kids and women hunted down like animals for fun.

He sees lips cut off of children and body parts blown off by explosions.

He sees kids that were burned alive.

The movie shows Sam being visibly shaken by the human-connived chaos that surrounds him, and rightfully so. As Sam contemplates what he has just seen, he makes a decision that will change his and his family's lives forever.
Upon his arrival back to the US, Sam tells his wife that he believes God has called him to make a difference in Africa. She is reluctant but ultimately gives him her blessing. When Sam returns to Africa and finds that he can't help the incomprehensible situation there by simply preaching or teaching or building village homes, John Rambo (oops, I means Sam)--the Machine Gun Preacher--puts on his cape and begins moving into action--but in a slightly more controversial manner.

At this point, I won't give you any more adjectives to describe this film. All I can say is go rent or better yet, buy this movie. But beware; you may also be tempted to leave your life of comfort, grab your AK-47 and go kick some evil A%# (I mean booty--but if you can't handle reading an soft-edited A@%, then you definitely shouldn't watch this movie.)

I am a prison minister and I will definitely be showing this movie to the guys at the prison. I am confident that they will be impacted for Christ.",1339372800,4,3770,4.67420814479638

Despite any controversy Sam may be facing, this film stands on its own and stands tall.

The films portrayal of coming back to the states after seeing the horrors of humanitarian work is all too real. Myself and many of my friends have felt the same way and for those emotions played out by Gerard, we're spot on.

I, and many of my friends would have seen this in theaters but for some reason, it was apparently abandoned by Relativity due to lack of interest.  It pains me to think that films that are display this passionate faith, done by top notch actors and film makers could just fall by the way side.

It didn't quite feel real though and I never really got emotionally into, even though it was based on a real story and there were some graphic violent scenes that should have made me feel something...I don't think the acting or dialogue was that believable.  One example, the guy gets out of prison and his wife comes to get him and they make a point of showing how she doesn't smoke, drink, strip, etc. anymore...then cut to scene of her riding him in a car on a street with others passing by.  They seemed really bent on making sure we saw her in that light while at the same time playing up how she's found God and church and it was cheesy.

Not just the Sudan but thru out Africa people are at war with one another in the most horrible way.  It is sad that this kind of thing has been going on for years and yet people only sit up and take notice when the story hits Youtube or gets made into a Hollywood movie.  Hotel Ruwanda was a far better film.

As he visits relief camps in the Sudan, he is appalled at the attacks on innocent villagers especially the atrocities perpetrated on children.  He finds himself becoming more and more obsessed with saving as many children as he can.  He sells everything he owns,  depriving his own family so he can keep his orphanage going and take care of the children he has saved.

All of the performances were superb,  there is wonderful chemistry between Gerard Butler and Michelle Monaghan who plays Sam's wife, Lynn.  Butler brings Sam Childers to the screen in all his bold, tough glory but he also brings the emotion that drives Sam.

Gerard Butler was at his best and you could see how he put his heart into showing the adversity it represented.  What a shame that it was never given enough theaters to get it's message out to the public.  I saw it on my birthday at the Archlight theater in Hollywood and was stunned when I turned a corner into the theater and ran right into Mr. Butler.

4679581,4,B005FITIF0,"Machine Gun Preacher is one of those movies that sneaks up on you, grabs your heart, and doesn't let go. Going into this movie, I'm a bit embarrassed to say I not only hadn't heard of Sam Childers and his work over in Sudan and Uganda, but had no idea who Joseph Kony was, the leader of the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army). But I guess that is the point of movies like this-- to educate and inform people about very serious current issues going on in the world. As a blogger, a teacher, and the type of person that is not afraid to speak my mind, I knew before the end credits rolled that I would be reviewing Machine Gun Preacher and dedicating the post to the children of Uganda and Sudan and to spread awareness so that Kony's reign of terror will end.

Gerard Butler does a great job portraying Sam Childers, former drug dealer, heroin addict, motorcycle misfit whose first moments on the screen is him being released after doing a stint in prison. I like the fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat how Sam used to be--you can add verbally abusive to his wife and not much of a father figure to his daughter to the list. But after a life changing incident, he allows his wife to clean him up and take him to the church that helped her find God (she was also a former addict & stripper).

Now many may think this movie is ""preachy"" since it shows Sam being baptized and he later builds his own church--but I'm setting the record straight, this movie's agenda is not to ""convert"" or ""recruit"" people to Christianity. This is not a film in the fashion of Fireproof and Courageous. The solid R rating should attest to that. But Sam IS a born again Christian and the movie IS about his life, so of course it's going to play an important part of the film. I just wanted to clear the air for those people that may have been thinking about skipping the film because they thought Machine Gun Preacher was going to be ""preachy"".

I don't want to give too much away as far as describing specific scenes since I think this movie is much more effective by watching it with your own eyes, but let me say there are definitely some shocking moments when Sam is over in Africa. Children being maimed, tortured, burned, children forced to kill other children, etc. The one scene I will divulge that pissed me off-- as it did Sam-- was actually the scene where he asks a rich businessman who praised his work over in Africa, for $5,000 which would help keep the orphanage running for another 6 months. The man invites Sam and his family over to a huge, lavish party where he hands him an envelope. Sam excuses himself to the bathroom, opens it, to find a check for....$150 dollars! WTF?? Sometimes I forget how selfish and self centered people can be!

What kept me from giving this movie a complete 5 star rating was more a directorial/writing/casting issue. The first thing that bothered me was the time transitions or lack there of. In the beginning of the movie, there was a little blurb that popped up to let everyone know what year it was. The rest of the film is not so kind. I'm not saying every scene needed a little blurb to let me know that time had passed, but there were definitely a few awkward time transitions that confused me. Most movies that are based on true stories will say something like, ""2 years later"" or something to help the viewer acclimate to the time change. In this movie, one minute Paige, Sam's daughter, is 5 years old, then she is suddenly in her young teens. This wouldn't be a big deal but I had to rewind it because while everyone else looked the same, there was an older actress playing Paige. I think a little blurb stating that time had passed would have been helpful.

Another awkward scene is when Donnie, Sam's best friend, tries to take over his nightly duties as a father. It's sweet that while Sam was over in Africa, Donnie would keep an eye on Lynn and Paige. But there is just this part where Donnie is telling Paige goodnight, and she asks, ""Aren't you gonna read me a book?"" Followed by her saying her dad normally kisses her on the forehead and he can do that if he wanted to. Now this isn't the 5 year old Paige asking this. It is the 13-14 year old Paige asking. I work with middle/high school kids and...I don't know, I just felt that that particular scene was creepy and awkward. Not many kids that age that I know would ask their dad's friend for a kiss on the forehead. That's just my opinion!

My last issue is a small one, more like a goof. There is a scene where Sam is at the airport to leave for Africa and Lynn, Paige, and Donnie walk him right up to the departing gate. I think everyone knows that doesn't happen anymore, especially after 9/11.

Like I said, these are just minor issues I had. If you plan on buying Machine Gun Preacher, it is due out on dvd and blu-ray on June 5th. When you get your copy, make sure you don't turn the film off right away. While the end credits role, there is some real life photos and footage of the real Sam Childers, his close friends/freedom fights Deng and Marco, etc. For more information on how you can help get involved in the fight against Kony, the evil leader of the LRA, come check out my blog. I have a link on there that will take you to a site so that you can get involved. I am going to end this post with something the real Sam says:

""For me to sit here and give all kinds of excuses to make it right, I can't do. But what I want to ask everyone out there, everyone that has a child, everyone that has a brother, a sister: if your child or family member was abducted today, if a mad man came in, a terrorist came in, abducted your family member or your child and if I said to you I can bring your child home...does it matter how I bring them home?"" --Sam Childers

4679593,1,B005FITIF0,"Could have been a good story if you can get around the 40 some f-words plus countless other swearing and a sex scene that did not need to be in the movie (or any movie for that matter). This is the farthest from a Christian movie that you can get. It is fouled up so bad. Maybe they should have gotten Sherwood Baptist to film it. To sum it up....here is a quote from Plugged in Online:

Inspiring. Devastating. Heartbreaking. Disturbing. Revelatory. Graphic. Raw. Those are just a few of the words that spring to mind as I ponder how to sum up Machine Gun Preacher, a complex, category-shattering story.

On one hand, director Marc Forster (who helmed The Kite Runner, a similarly wrenching film) has served up a spiritually poignant story that evokes comparisons to the kind of movies Sherwood Pictures is making--movies like Courageous and Fireproof that unashamedly preach Jesus and show the difference He makes in someone's life. On the other, this deservedly R-rated film pulls absolutely no punches when it comes to hard-edged content: obscenity, violence, drug abuse and sex. In these areas, Machine Gun Preacher is much more akin to Schindler's List and The Apostle, both tales of similarly broken men desperately trying to find redemption in the midst of trying, sometimes brutal circumstances.

Forster says of his protagonist, ""The fascinating thing about [Sam] is that he is a very flawed character. He has been abusive to himself and to others throughout his life. Those are just facts. At the same time, he has put his life on the line to save hundreds and hundreds of kids. There is this conflict within the character that makes for truly interesting storytelling.""

""The movie definitely was not made for Christian people,"" Sam told me in a recent phone interview. ""I should say it was not made for religious people. I feel that every Christian person out there is going to want to hand tickets out. I think it's a great outreach. ... There's no way you can walk into the theater and walk out of the theater, and not be preached to in this movie. So it's like planting seeds. [The movie] shows a conversion. And it shows it in a raw way that most people in the world and of the world can relate to.""

He's dead right about one thing: Anyone who watches this movie will be forced to grapple with some pretty significant questions. How do we respond to evil? Can God forgive our most heinous choices? Is violent resistance in defending the innocent ever warranted?

But I'll add one more that's harder to answer than it at first seems: Is a violent, drug-addled and profanity-laced R-rated movie required to raise those issues?",1332720000,16,2642,4.745098039215686

It's a little dicey in the beginning and I was thinking maybe I shouldn't have brought my 15 y.o. daughter to see it with the violence, drug abuse, sex scene and cursing but it was his life and she's met Sam so she knows how he has changed.  It lets you see the atrocities being done to these people in other parts of the world and how Sam and others are helping them too.

4679596,5,B005FITIF0,"Machine Gun Preacher is intense and it will haunt you. Gerard Butler is nothing short of phenomenal. For the first time since I became aware of him, I stopped seeing Gerard Butler, despite the fact that I know what Sam Childers looks like. He just became the character.

The movie depicts violence with unflinching candor. It weighs the good religion can do against the bad that men can do and leaves the final judgment to viewers (and gives them credit for their intelligence and ability to do so.) And because I've been following all of this so closely, by the time the pics of the real Sam, (along with Lynn, Paige, Deng and the kids) came up with the credits, it felt like I was seeing a friend. I love the way the camera pulls up and away for the parting shot, leaving Sam standing amid the children on the desolate African plain until he ultimately becomes a speck on the landscape. It reminds us to keep the big picture in mind.

The first time I saw it, despite the fact that I was looking forward to it so much that I had purchased my ticket a full month ahead of time, my head was swirling with all of the negativity that I'd been reading in the week or so before it was released in Boston. Whenever there was a scene I'd read something about, all I could do was compare what I'd read to what I was seeing. It distracted me from fully experiencing the movie, not to mention left me wondering where the derision was coming from.

The second time I was able to just let it wash over me so that I could absorb it. I think it affected me even more that time, despite the fact that I knew what was coming. It's not something one (or at least I ) can shake off easily.

Without taking every dismissive remark I've read one by one or line by line, let me just tell you what I thought. I love the look of the film. It's got this grainy 70s quality to it that at times, coupled with the hand-held camera work, makes it seem almost like a documentary (more on that later) or a home movie. (There is one shot that I am completely enamored of, that comes about 2/3 in. It's a scene in Sam's church, after he's gone around the bend and there is a combined camera/sound effect that reflects the tension and the chaos inside of the man.)

The film opens with a scene of incomprehensible brutality and then quickly cuts to the seemingly more mundane life of a reprobate getting out of prison. Even as we bear witness to the brutal thug that is Sam Childers as he interacts with his family and wastes his life in a drug-fueled haze, the specter of that other scene hangs over everything and we wonder where and how the two will intersect.

Sam's life very quickly (in movie time) spirals downward to rock bottom. The majority of reviews I've read can't, or won't, even keep the timeline straight. Sam did not find religion and start his church. He found religion, a number of years passed and he went to Africa on a service mission and when he came back from his first trip he made plans to build a church and build his orphanage.

It needed to happen quickly. Did we really need to watch Sam shoot up in the bathroom of a biker bar more than once to understand who and what he is? By the time the catalytic encounter with the drifter occurs, we understand how bad he is. It is a testament to Sam Childers that he has the strength to reach out to his wife at that point and a testament to Gerard Butler's abilities as an actor that we feel his pain.
We also feel his confusion and trepidation as he sits in church, debating whether or not he's worthy of baptism and accepting Jesus into his life as his savior. The phrase ""nervous as a whore in church"" came immediately to mind.

Time passes and it becomes evident that Sam has turned his life around and has devoted himself to making a better one for his family. Whether or not this is because of God is almost irrelevant. It is certainly because he's kicked his drug habit and changed his ways. Anything that helped him with that is a good thing, no matter what you believe. Sam believes it was God. He also believes that God wants him to help others and he starts with his best friend Donnie. (Much has been made over the fact that ""Donnie"" is not an actual person. Let's not forget that it is a movie. Some things are embellished for dramatic effect, time is compressed, real people become composites. I think there's a lot of Sam and Lynn's unseen son in Donnie- a brilliant Michael Shannon-, who suffered a similar fate.) If you're watching a movie about the 100 Years War, it's not made in real time. Sam Childers is painted in broad strokes because otherwise it would have been a six hour movie. The quest to build the orphanage threatens to consume him. He neglects his own family, including daughter Paige (Madeline Carroll. It is to her credit that she manages to deliver the film's most predictable and ridiculous line with enough real emotion and depth of feeling that we buy it), and remains as difficult and self-destructive as he ever was. I don't think it was ever his intention for the African part of his life to overshadow his life at home. When he returned from that first missionary trip, he had enough energy and zeal for both.

With the orphanage, and his desire to save ""those kids"", Sam now has a new focus, or a new addiction. He believes he's found his purpose and he pursues it with blinders on. He's ""made it {his} struggle...{He's} the one that's gonna do it."" As Butler has said when describing the character he plays, ""It's about a man who fought his demons, but never banished them entirely."" It's easy to see why Sam latched on to those kids the way he did, aside from the fact that he has an addictive personality (much like the actor who plays him. And make no mistake, anyone who becomes an addict has an addictive personality, whether it's cigarettes, alcohol, drugs or sex. Addiction isn't about the thing that the addict is addicted to; it's about the high that the addict achieves from the addiction that hides or suppresses deeper issues. It fills a void.)

In truth, I think that there is probably another movie that was left on the cutting room floor and a lot of the problems that a lot of people had with the film could be fixed with better editing. There were some aspects that I would have liked to have seen more fleshed out, such as Lynn's struggle back home. We're asked to take her acceptance of Sam and his mission on as much faith as she apparently was. The scene with the phone call where Lynn is in the pristine grocery store at home while Sam wanders amid the chaos of a Sudanese town, after the LRA has burned down his newly built orphanage, says a lot about their relationship. Presumably Lynn hasn't been to Africa yet, she has no real idea of the conditions there or what Sam is actually going through, but she knows he needs it, needs to be there and needs to rebuild as much as the children do. That makes her fears and her despair for what it eventually does to him all the more poignant.

It's tempting to say that some of the scenes in Africa could have been tightened up or ask if we needed that many to understand the struggle. Ultimately I have to say, yes we did. Every one of them propels Sam along his road.

But I also feel that the majority of the people that didn't like the movie are all sounding like broken records. They are like a rock skipping over the surface of a lake (to REALLY mix my metaphors) refusing to go deeper and refusing to see what's really there. They all read like they made up their minds before they saw the thing. Even the responses to the review on the NY Times website called out the critic for trying to pigeon-hole the film (as well as trying to be clever) by reviewing it based on their expectations as opposed to what's on the screen*.

One of the movie's greatest strengths in my eyes is what is being called a weakness by many others and that's that it does not take you by the hand and lead you to conclusions. It lets you make up your own mind.

Any critic's opinion is still only their opinion and everyone is entitled to their own. The problem is that there are a lot of people who read these opinions and then their minds are already shaped before they've seen the film.

I don't think that I'm giving anything away when I tell you that there are a couple of lines in the film that, to me, sum up Sam's arc, at least in terms of the movie. Deng asks him what he's ""looking for in this place"". At the time, Sam either doesn't know or isn't able to articulate what we as an audience can guess, but Sam answers ""I ain't lookin' for nothin'."" Later, after he's opened himself up to his purpose, he tells William, probably because he thinks William doesn't speak English, ""I'm scared that one day I'll close my eyes to all a' this and let it be someone else's problem"".

William, by the way, played by Junior Magale, is just the most beautiful little boy with the most expressive eyes. His awe of ""the white preacher"" is writ large on his face, which makes his discovery that he can be of help to this man, that he is needed, so powerful. After four viewings, I still sob at their ultimate scene together.

Gerard Butler plays Sam as complicated as well as courageous. He's forceful and maybe even a little crazy. Butler is in virtually every scene and there is always something interesting going on. We have only to watch his face or look into his eyes to know where he is at any given moment. He takes Sam from humility to protectiveness to raging, out of control hostility and borderline psychosis and back again. This is Butler's movie all the way. If you don't buy his performance, you don't buy the movie.

I have to say, I love the score for the film as well. I was already a fan of Asche & Spencer and their soundtracks for two other Forster films, Monster's Ball and Stay. The music for Machine Gun Preacher is, for the most part spare and lean, acting as a thread that weaves in and out of the narrative without being intrusive (just as a good score should do), but it's also got some memorable themes and when it swells during the final shot, it moves me to the point that I have to remember to breathe.

There is a documentary in the final stages of post production on the life of Sam Childers. While many have suggested that that format would have better suited the life story of so complex a character, the irony is that without this film and the publicity generated by it, the documentary probably would not have the chance to be seen by anything resembling a wide audience.",1331424000,9,10541,4.3634046890927625
4679597,5,B005FITIF0,"Based on a true story, the movie opens with a brutal genocidal attack on a village, one where a child is being forced at gunpoint to smash his mother's head...but before that happens we flashback 2 weeks earlier. Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is getting out of prison. He was quick sex with his wife (Michelle Monaghan) in the car before they make it home to the trailer park. He is upset that his wife is now packing mushrooms and has stopped stripping, but not as upset as I was.

Within 5 minutes, Sam reaches a point in his life where he will either die, go back to jail, or find the Jesus he dreads. He opts for the lesser of 3 evils and goes to church with his wife. He finds Jesus, a bar of soap, shampoo, and a shirt with sleeves. When Jesus sends a tornado through central Pa., it created a construction business for Sam, however the only way he can stop chasing the rabbit is to save his buddy. The next thing you know, he is off to Africa.

Combining his Christian belief and bad boy past (which, believe it or not the movie downplayed) Sam decides he can help in Sudan and save part of it by building an orphanage (target) in a war zone. He discovers things are not that easy, even with God on your side. Sam becomes obsessed with Sudan to the point it effects his home life. The scenes have low level intensity.

This is an excellent film. It is well acted with mediocre editing. This is not a ""come to Jesus"" film, but the story can not be told without showing that aspect of Sam's life. Indeed, at one point the violence causes Sam to question his faith. The closing credits shows actual film of Sam and his family.

4679598,4,B005FITIF0,"Here is a great story about a real-life person and ongoing social issues. It is about a Pennsylvania biker and former alcohol/drug-addict ex-convict, who is converted to Christianity, goes to Uganda and South Sudan, and decides to dedicate his life to saving children, building an orphanage there. His name is Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler) and he intends to protect these children, some of whom are abducted by a militant group the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army), and he does so, no matter what it takes.

I will not discuss here the serious issue of ""child soldiers"" that has been around for many years, a topic that has been also taken up in such films as ""Johnny Mad Dog"" and ""Blood Diamond."" Director Marc Forster provides enough information for us to understand what Childers aka Machine Gun Preacher does to rescue the children in the social context of Africa and its political situations. The film includes several action set-pieces in which Childers fights back the attacking soldiers, but I think they are one or two too many. Violence is discreetly presented, but what is suggested is sometimes shocking.

Gerard Butler, charismatic as ever, carries the film throughout almost single-handedly. Audiences may either admire or dislike the character he plays, but either way they will be fascinated by his strong performance. Part shot in South Africa, the on-location photography is credible. Soulymane Sy Savan as Deng, a Sudanese telling Sam the harsh reality of his land is impressive.

But most supporting characters are underwritten. It seems the subplot of Sam's friend Donnie (talented Michael Shannon, wasted) is heavily shortened, and so does the back story of Sam's wife Lynn Childers (Michelle Monaghan), even though some (including me) may find her character more intriguing than Sam Childers himself. Kathy Baker as Sam's mother is almost non-existent.

Based on Sam Childers' memoir ""Another Man's War"" (which I haven't read), ""Machine Gun Preacher"" is an average biographical film with a powerhouse performance from the lead. But to really know this complicated character, perhaps we should read the book first.",1330646400,7,2141,5.197101449275363
4679599,4,B005FITIF0,"This is a tough film to review because our ""Machine Gun Preacher"" was a violent person in the opening scenes. I know there are many moviegoers who would be inspired by this film but they will have to endure that first half hour. I guess you can't see what our hero has become until you see what he has been, so this R-rated film contains gunfire, disturbing images, drug use and lots of profanity.

Real-life Sam Childers served as the consultant, which is a fictionalized account of his headstrong, passionate and unusual life. Childers was a biker, a felon, and a drug-dealing addict who became a Christian crusader dedicated to saving hundreds of children in the Sudan who, if they were lucky enough to survive, were handed AK 47s and forced to serve as soldiers. His mission to save children is no longer limited to one country. He has centers in several African countries, plus in the United States. (Google Sam Childers) I hasten to emphasize, Childers' endeavors are humanitarian, NOT religious. He says, ""You don't ask a hungry child who he worships.""

These actors portray real people:

  *Gerard Butler (""Phantom of the Opera"") is Childers. Butler does a masterful job showing us the arc of Sam's early violent life followed by his conversion to Christ, and then his rage at the treatment of the children in the Sudan.
  *Michelle Monaghan (""Source Code"") plays his wife, a former stripper named Lynn, who, in my opinion, is truly Sam's anchor. Without Lynn's tough love and staunch support, his efforts would have collapsed long ago.
  *Kathy Baker (""Seven Days in Utopia"") is Daisy, the ever-lovin' Mama who swapped the gun in Sam's belt for a Bible....
  *Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road"") is Donnie, the ne'er-do-well brother who can't seem to get his bearings. This Oscar-nominated actor is so good it's spooky.

Director Marc Forster (""The Kite Runner"") knows how to work with children so we know this inspiring story is in good hands. Script writer Jason Keller spent a year traveling with Childers and accumulating stories from his legendary life. This script compresses about 30 exciting years into a two-hour movie.

It is obvious that not only is Sam passionate about his work, but scriptwriter Keller too, has become evangelistic about helping the innocent victims of this senseless slaughter. I have asked Amazon.com to notify me when this DVD becomes available.",1326931200,14,2390,4.974874371859296
4679600,5,B005FITIF0,"I feel very fortunate to be one of the few people who was able to see Machine Gun Preacher in the theater, since it was not shown in very many places!! (For some UNEXPLAINED reason!?!)  It was an EXCELLENT movie........very moving, POWERFUL, thought-provoking, and well-acted by everyone.....especially Gerard Butler!  He absolutely nailed the character of Sam Childers.  He was not a very likeable person in the beginning, as he was just plain no-good....into drugs, crime, etc.  After a missionary trip to Africa, his whole focus changed into wanting to save the children from the LRA. It was an AMAZING transformation and one that really should be shared.  Although it does have parts that are sad to watch, it IS based on a true story and it does make people aware of the unimaginable atrocities that still occur around the world! I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so that I can watch it again!!",1325635200,30,904,4.769230769230769
4679601,5,B005FITIF0,"I'm giving 5 stars to the trailer.  The trailer advertised limited release.  All the money spent to produce this film and then limited release?  I live in the country in Texas.  I will have to wait and buy the movie to see it.  I read the book the movie was based on and  then bought more books to share with friends.

I saw a review that said the movie under performed.  Of course it would under perform on limited release!  Then we're stuck with the garbage Hollywood puts out the rest of the year.  Maybe it's just because the word Preacher is in the title.
