8198823,4,B000LOGY0K,"The subtitles were good except at the end, the last episode didn't have any. Overall though it was very good. Occasionally it was hard to read the subtitle since the subtitles were white and blended in with the background but this didn't happen a lot of times.",1270252800,,260,4.553191489361702
8198824,5,B000LOGY0K,"Wow, i looooooove this drama. One of my favorites. Jae Hae has excellent comedic talent. Han Chae Young has excellent chemistry with Jae Hae. Mongryong and his dad...man...they are so hilarious....hahahaha
You will laugh with mongryong and at the same time get annoyed with chunhyang for giving him so much pain.
anyhow, highly recommend this movie..its a light hearted comedy with a dose of drama.",1198022400,3,398,5.138461538461539
8198825,5,B000LOGY0K,"I totally agreed that this k-drama is worth the buying and one of the best k-drama i've ever seen. Han Chae young and Jae Dee were both excellent in portraying their roles as love birds who happened to in love at a wrong time. However, the ending was really satisfying....buy this one and you'll end up loving it.",1196726400,4,313,4.413793103448276
8198826,5,B000LOGY0K,So glad I found this. I'm not big on foreign TV series until I saw this. After I saw 1 episode I watched all of them......in 1 sitting. 17 hours strait. It was like a 17 hour crack addiction :). I only wish I could praise the TV here in the US the same way but I can't. Chun-Hyang and Mong-ryong are forced to get married because it is the only way the school would let them graduate after being caught in bed together (nothing happened between them but it looks bad in the public's eyes). This movie is all about bad timing with the two lover birds Chun-Hyang. There is way too much in the series to sum up in a paragraph but basically Chun-Hyang and Mong-ryong develop affairs and many times they have to choose between each other and they person that they are having the affair with. Take my word if you like genuine love stories it doesn't get any better than this one. Best I've seen,1194048000,3,888,4.229411764705882
8198827,5,B000LOGY0K,"This was one of the top 10 Korean Drama of 2005, constantly in number 1 spot and rightfully so.

But if you don't like mushy stuff this series isn't for you.. At times it is a bit excessively corny. However the story line is unique and worth watching.. With good acting by Jae Hee and Chae-yeong and almost everyone else.

The editorial review / product description is about 5% right.. The series was made by KBS (Korean Broadcasting System) not PBS. It is the modern day version of the Legend of Chun-Hyang. In this series Seong Chun Hyang (Han Chae Young) is a daughter of a poor cabaret singer. She is pretty, independent and the smartest girl in school. Lee Mong-ryong (Jae Hee) is the bratty son of the police chief, who's always in trouble. The two high school kids are forced into an arranged marriage due to a drunken night incident, where they slept in a same room, which led to a huge rumor and an uncomfortable situation. This is where the story begins.

I'm not going to get into the details and ruin the spoiler. But watch it you might like it. It's the ultimate chick flick with lots of twists and turns and tragedy and finally a happy ending. I absolutely loved the hilarious previous life and other korean drama parodies the series pulled. Like the legend, there's rich and powerful Byun Hak-do who falls in love with Chun-Hyang and manipulates Chun-Hyang to break up with Mong-Ryong. There's also Chae-rin who is Mong-Ryong's first crush who wants the couple to break up.

Another name of the series is.. Delightful Girl Choon-Hyang (or Chun-Hyang).. I wish Amazon could post trailers of the videos.. You can find the trailer on you tube I guess..",1177545600,12,1664,4.6305084745762715
