8202364,5,B000RRC0GS,"A pretty wonderful film of the great George Bernard Shaw play.

Both Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller are terrific in the leads, and this
production brings out both the fun and wit of Shaw's words, without
losing the sharp, complex, and sometimes paradoxical political and
social observations underneath the playful extrtior.

Dated in style, yes, and it could be argued Hiller is a bit older than ideal
for the character's innocence. And some of the supporting performances
are too stagy (although some are very good indeed).

But overall this is a lot of fun, and quite thought provoking, with a
nicely ambiguous ending.

Note: If the film itself is all you really care about, you can get the
Criterion's excellent transfer  in the Janus 'Essential Art House'
version for less money.  The only difference are the extras. (Criterion
also owns the 'Essential Art House' label, and puts out stripped down
versions of a number of films that way).  And in this case the only
notable extra is an interesting booklet essay by film critic David
Ehrenstein.",1345939200,,1048,4.920454545454546

George Bernard Shaw won a Best Screenplay Oscar for PYGMALION, an award that he reputedly disdained.

After brief runs in Austria and a German language theater in America, Shaw's ""Pygmalion: A Romance in Five Acts"" premiered on the London stage on 4/11/14. It starred and was partly inspired by Mrs Patrick Campbell, an actress of considerable talent who was known for using an affected accent whenever she performed. Her co-star as Henry Higgins, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree was the grandfather of David Tree. He plays Freddy Eynsford-Hill in this Leslie Howard-directed 1938 film adaptation. Viola Tree, who has a bit role as a social reporter, is David's mother.

SYNOPSIS--
While taking notes on lower class accents in a market square, professor of phoenics Henry Higgins (Howard) encounters and immediately bonds with Col. George Pickering (Sunderland), a man who's written a book on spoken Sanskrit. A friend tells flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Hiller) that Higgins is writing down everything she says, so she confronts him.

After reassuring the girl that he's not a cop, Higgins remarks to Pickering that if he wished to do so, within a few months he could teach this ""guttersnipe"" impeccable diction and pass her off as a lady at the highest level of society. He also tells Eliza that she'd be able to open her own flower shop if she spoke proper English. Pickering scoffs at Higgins' boasts and the two men wander off after the professor gives his pocket change to the perplexed flower girl.

Higgins has invited his new friend to stay at his Wimpole St. home. The next morning they're surprised to see that Eliza's come to visit, hoping to be taught to speak like a ""lay-dee."" Pickering bets Higgins that he can't do as he claimed the previous night and offers to pay all of Eliza's expenses. Higgins accepts the challenge and so the experiment begins.

8202367,5,B000RRC0GS,"This superlative, award winning film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play is as delightful today as when it was first filmed, nearly sixty five years ago. This ageless story, based upon Greek mythology in which an ivory statue of a maiden, Galatea, is brought to life by the prayers of its sculptor, Pygmalion, features a professor of linguistics, Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard), who takes a cockney flower seller, Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller), and bets that, within a matter of six months, he can turn her into a lady who can pass in high society without betraying her lowly origins.

Leslie Howard, wonderful in the role, is the quintessential Henry Higgins, playing him as an arrogant, aristocratic misogynist whose own mother (Marie Lohr) barely finds him tolerable. Henry makes his bet about his prospective success with Eliza with his friend, the kindly Col. George Pickering (Scott Sunderland), a wealthy gentleman who bankrolls the costs of Eliza's transformation from guttersnipe to royal pretender.

Wendy Hiller is perfectly cast in the role of Eliza, having a certain earthiness about her, which makes her so believable as the cockney upstart. Yet, she has enough of an incandescence about her, so as to make her believable in her transition from gutter to drawing room. Scott Sunderland is wonderful as Col. Pickering, the buffer between Henry and Eliza. Marie Lohr is excellent as Mrs. Higgins, Henry's exasperated mother. The scene in which Eliza has tea with Henry's unsuspecting mother and her guests is one of the funniest on the silver screen. Look also to a wonderful, comedic foray by Wildred Lawson, as Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle.

All in all, this is a film that has withstood the test of time. The precursor for the musical adaptation, ""My Fair Lady"", ""Pygmalion"" reigns supreme. Nominated for four Academy Awards and winning two, this is the definitive adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's play, sharp and witty. Deftly directed by Leslie Howard and Anthony Asquith, it is simply a magnificently acted, comedic film, and one that those who love classic, vintage films will enjoy. Bravo!",1094256000,,2121,5.142028985507246
