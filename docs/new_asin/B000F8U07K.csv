8119176,5,B000F8U07K,"I never miss an episode of Candice's show ""Divine Design"" and so this DVD is right up my alley.

And even if you're not a fan of Candice Olson and have never seen her show, you will LOVE this DVD.  It features her and her crew renovating kitchens and baths, and as usual, it's great to watch the whole process.

If you enjoy decorating, or just dreaming, you'll love this DVD.",1149033600,24,376,4.267605633802817
