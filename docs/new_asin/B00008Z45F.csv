1871074,5,B00008Z45F,"These movies are an instant classic. If you liked the original TV series, you'll love these spoofs. The acting is great and the characters are so believable. Fun for the whole family and very well done. Actually the Sequel is better than the first, but overall they both get 5 outta 5 stars. ""Far out and Groooovy!""",1216944000,2,315,4.543859649122807
1871075,5,B00008Z45F,I' a big fan of the original Brady Bunch series and watched them while growing up as well as watching re-runs again present day. The movie remakes were done well. The actors all looked very close to the original characters from physical appearances to the way they spoke and moved. The movies picked a bunch of the popular episodes and meshed them all in together into the movie on top of the main plots. They were a lot of fun to watch and are added to my collection of other Brady Bunch DVD's,1215820800,,494,4.32258064516129
1871076,5,B00008Z45F,Good family fun!  Very enjoyable spoofs!  Anyone who enjoyed the original Brady Bunch television series will enjoy the spoofs made of them as much.,1207353600,,147,5.083333333333333
1871077,5,B00008Z45F,"Now I normally despise remakes of old tv shows, but the Brady Bunch movies are different - they don't ""do the same old thing"" with updated sets and characters nothing like the originals...

...they are the original characters surrounded by an updated reality.

The movies are parodies of the tv show they pay homage to, but at themselves as well.  They are not a desire to modernize old characters that some dilettante dingbat thinks modern audiences would appreciate (hint, modern audiences DON'T), but the writers actually did something creative without losing the essence of the original characters.  They knew the charcters and how to fit the new style comedy.  They have the surreal spark that actually makes doing something with an old premise worthwhile.  And such a mix is a rare treat; that most tv-made-into-movies creators just cannot even begin to grasp.

The movies themselves are a handful of vignettes from original TV episodes; but warped with modern day society - including puns that would otherwise be deemed vulgar, come off surprisingly inoffensive because these characters are still in the 1970s and the rest of the world is in 1995 (or 1996).

Well, there are some differences - nobody expected the movie's writers to also incorporate the actual actors' behind-the-scenes moments into the movies as well; it has been said that the actors playing Marcia and Greg may have dated, so lo and behold the writers turn Movie Marcia and Movie Greg into doing it.  This is somewhat perverse, but because we all know it's a self-referential homage, the end result is more hilarious than vulgar.

Of course, there are the DVDs themselves - the 5.1 Dolby sound is terrific, and the visual looks colorful and crisp, even if there are some periodic artifacting defects.  Nothing major.  And it's in 16:9 enhanced format, so I'm not going to complain.

The DVD releases are solid, there's little that could be done to improve the quality, and it's a shame a third Brady movie was never made.  And it's a shame so many old-tv-to-movie shows are even given a first shot with their ""movies by numbers"" ineptitude.",1176681600,4,2117,4.926760563380282
1871078,5,B00008Z45F,"back in the day when jan was all like ""Marshs, Marsha, Marsha . . . it's always all about Marsha!"" it was great -

in the film you see the underlying Pschotic Break happening as the voice tell her what to do -

the new film versions of old shows bring in quality science -

what Lost in Space moive does to justify the classic timetravel paradox -

this here film does to explore modern thought on abnormal psychology

it's like the same entertainment we grew up with with all our education in human nature mixed in

finally the 60's and 70's have grown up with us noe having th skills to present a great story without spaceships on strings and see how a family can remain in there own personal timewarp",1166918400,,703,4.287878787878788
1871079,5,B00008Z45F,"I am a die-hard Brady fan.  The first movie is hilarious.  Perfect movie to watch on a rainy day or when it's so cold out, all you want to do is relive your favorite Brady movies in these funny satires.  In my opinion, the first movie is much better than the second.  However, there are a few funny parts here and there in the second.

Highly recommended!",1162771200,,355,4.2388059701492535
1871080,5,B00008Z45F,"I love this movie, but this review is not about the movie itself. It is about the review ""Brody ""Brodyman"" (Amity Island)"" wrote. It was complete and utter bull that needs to be taken off this website. Brody himself needs to be removed as well, looking at many of his other reviews, which are quite gross, creepy, and uncalled for. So those of you who want to know the truth about this movie, I suggest you buy it because it really is hysterical. But obviously Brody was talking about his own family bunch, because none of what he said was true about this movie.",1148947200,,562,4.413461538461538
1871081,4,B00008Z45F,"Shelley Long (as Carol), Gary Cole (as Mike) and Christine Taylor (as Marsha) were born to play these roles. The rest of the cast is great too (no-name Jan, Jennifer Cox, has some great lines and confused looks). Gary Cole nailed all of Mike Brady's mannerisms, voice inflections, and all around character to a flipping tee. Shelley Long was a great choice and she played the part of ever upbeat and quirky Carol beautifully. I couldn't have chosen two better actors to play Mike & Carol - these two performers knew their charactors like the back of their hands. For those of us who grew up in the late 1960's and 70's when the Brady's were on prime time TV - these movies are a great flashback. The Brady's are still stuck in their 70's time warp with all of America changing (1990's style) around them. The house interior and backyard scenes were just as I remembered them. While each of these movies are not deep or valuable as far as the material goes... the entertainment value in my book is still high. These 2 movies were just plain fun to watch and I found myself laughing out loud many times. The ""Sequel"" is equally good and just as funny. Cameos by most of the original cast and a few other stars including Michael McKean (Lavern & Shirley's ""Lenny"") and Davey Jones and The Monkees. DVD extras are minimal, but worth it on the low price alone.",1095379200,5,1355,4.489878542510121
1871082,5,B00008Z45F,"I personally think that these two movies were very very underated.  They were both a dead on spoof to the actual tv show.  I think the person who casted the actors for this movie deserves a huge award, they did an absolute wonderful job.  The second is actually a little bit better than the first.  My only dream is that they would come out with a third one, I belive that it is a dismal wish however since the second one came out a while a go, and there has been no talk about a third.  Do yourself a favor and watch these you won't be displeased.",1058572800,23,548,4.08411214953271

7988137,5,B00008Z45F,"When my brother told me to watch these movies, I thought, huh? You've got to be kidding. I grew up watching the series, but as an adult, I couldn't fathom watching it now. But these movies are great! All the actors have every mannerism of their character down pat, and the writing actually is pretty tongue in cheek regarding the series. You won't be disappointed!",1417046400,,364,4.615384615384615
7988138,5,B00008Z45F,"Wonderfully funny and often hilarious take on the iconic 70s family in a 90s world.
While this movie would be enjoyed by those on the outside, so to speak, to a regular watcher of the TV series, as so many of us kids of the 70's were, it is filled with great lines and references to episodes of the original series.  I say laugh out loud funny, and I don't use that phrase lightly.  Done campy but lovingly,
Sherwood Schwartz, the shows creator, had his hand in this production.  The actors are ""right on"" with their portrayals.  Especially Christine Taylor as the vain Marcia Marcia Marcia and Gary Cole as the advice dispensing Mike Brady.  Both very well done and yes funny movies.",1314230400,,684,4.528455284552845
7988139,4,B00008Z45F,"I enjoyed both movies and they played with errors or skips.

I would recommend it for purchase if you like the fun that will insue.

7988140,5,B00008Z45F,"If you grew up watching the antics of the Brady Bunch weekly, as I did, you'll love these two movies not only because they pay loving homage to the original series but because there are references to other Sherwood Schwartz shows as well.  And no, it's not always about ""Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!"", but rather the whole cast.
The actors portraying the Brady Kids are amazing in the ways in which they've nailed their characters every little movement and nuance.

You'll love 'em!",1259625600,,477,4.804878048780488

This is a great seller, great service, very fast shipping

7988142,5,B00008Z45F,"True to form, a campy movie X2!!!
Fun for the family, except maybe the line from Sam ""delivering meat"" when asked why he was there with Alice at night..

Just fun!!!",1223510400,,165,4.32258064516129
7988143,3,B00008Z45F,"The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel has its moments but don't expect a carbon copy of the t.v. version. The jokes are more crude and ironic and not wishy-washy and oh so polite. Shelley Long is perfectly cast as Carol Brady, her comic timing is impeccable. The rest of the cast are a little bit over their heads, Christine Taylor is pretty good as superficial Marsha though. I didn't care for the first film, the sequel is much stronger and funnier. A mixed bag for me but enjoy!",1221523200,,489,4.384615384615385
