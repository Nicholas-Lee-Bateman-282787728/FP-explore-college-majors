7922564,5,B00004TJJK,My 6 daycare kids love this series.  It's nice to have a good super hero that tackles things they'll actually go through in school.,1403308800,,131,4.458333333333333
7922565,5,B00004TJJK,"I have a 5 year old son who loves superheros. However these heros all have one thing in common, fighting. I found it very difficult to limit these videos from my son who loves them, and explain to him why these videos send  the wrong messages to him. In this video, the concept of fighting is  addressed with scripture and is presented by a man who I am proud for my  son to imitate. I love that the Armor of God is also addressed.  We've had  this video for 3 days and my son is so enthusiastic about Bibleman. It  helps that mom is approving too. My son is also sharing these scriptures at  school with friends when faced with similar ""fighting""  situations.  This is truly a Godsend for me.",963446400,7,693,4.269230769230769
7922566,5,B00004TJJK,"When I saw this video I was drawn to the fact that it dealt with rage. My 5 year old son has a bad temper (he inherited it from his fathers side, of course!) This video helped him to learn how to deal with anger, and is  enjoyable for children who do not know much about the Bible. A great video  to show for anger management in young children",961632000,7,343,3.9565217391304346
