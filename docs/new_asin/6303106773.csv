To see Duvall at his best, try ""Broken Trail."" A masterpiece of the West.",1158969600,8,241,4.1063829787234045
569758,5,6303106773,"I bought this movie because I'm a Duvall fan.  He is, in my mind, the American Olivier.  I watched the movie once and turned around and watched it again, immediately.  The setting, the interactions between Duvall's character (Old Soll) and those around him is an amazing window into a past era.  Convicts has elements of being almost a stage playj.  Convicts is a gem and another feather in the cap of our likely greastest living American actor.",1131408000,72,445,4.7272727272727275
569759,2,6303106773,"Strange stuff--Duvall rants, gibbers, and fires a shotgun into an empty closet. Haas watches, listens, and smiles a lot. The great James Earl Jones wanders in, scratches his beard and mutters to himself, and walks out again. If this sounds like your kind of thing, jump right in. But nobody's ever going to claim this is Horton Foote's finest hour.",1073174400,4,348,4.816666666666666
569760,5,6303106773,"THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE MOVIES THAT GOT LOST AND FORGOTTEN BECAUSE IT DIDNT HAVE SEX AND VIOLENCE IN STARRING ROLES.
A YOUNG BOY WHO JUST WANTS TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY HIS FATHER A GRAVESTONE AND KEEP HIMSELF IN CHEWING TOBACCO GOES TO WORK ON AN EAST TEXAS SUGAR PLANTATION AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. HIS BOSS IS CROTCHETY AND BARELY LUCID ROBERT DUVALL. DUVALL EMPLOYS PRISON CONVICTS TO WORK ON THE PLACE AND RULES OVER THEM WITH A WEAK BUT IRON FIST.
ALL PARTS ARE WELL PLAYED AND HORTON FOOTES WRITING IS GREAT AS ALWAYS.
THE FILMS SHINING MOMENTS ARE WHENEVER DUVALL IS ON THE SCREEN AS THE PHILISOPHICAL, RAMBLING OLD GEYSER WHO'S MIND IS RAVAGED BY AGE. THESE SCENES WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING AND WEEPING WITHIN SECONDS OF EACH OTHER.
DUVALL IS PROBABLY THE MOST GIFTED ACTOR WORKING TODAY. HE BRINGS 'REALNESS' TO HIS CHARACTERS THAT FEW OTHER 'PLAYERS' CAN MANAGE.
'CONVICTS' IS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PIECES OF QUALITY FLIM MAKING THAT OCCASIONALLY MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH THE LIBERAL PERVERSNESS THAT SEEMS TO INFLUENCE MOST OF WHAT MAKES IT TO THE SCREEN THESE DAYS.
ITS A GREAT LITTLE FILM.",1062201600,9,1116,4.67005076142132
569761,5,6303106773,"Robert Duvall is a direct descendent of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, according the IMDb.com movie database. After seeing this film, you may think Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at it's best.
One of my most favorite films. I wish the composer,  Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful scenery and music and ""all too-true-to-life,"" especially for those of us that live in, or have moved to, the South. This is a ""real moment in time."" Life moves on, slowly, but ""strangers we do not remain.""",1047081600,37,539,4.923076923076923
569762,5,6303106773,"'Convicts' leaves the viewer with a lot to think about.  This movie is recommended for those types who enjoy sitting quietly and watching scenes unfold as if watching through a window.  Robert Duvall's character is quite interesting and his portrayal conveys very well the mood of uncertainty that the boy's character must surely feel very strongly throughout his time at the farm.
I think it takes a viewer that finds pleasure in quiet thinking to enjoy this film as it takes some reflection on the viewers part to determine just what the story was and what it means to them.  There isn't a lot of action, but plenty to stimulate conversation afterwards.  The is one of the few movies I would want to watch more than a couple of times.
Movies with a similar quiet feel and are also very good:
'Where The River's Flow North'- Rip Torn, Tantoo Cardinal, Michael J Fox and Treat Williams.
'The Ballad of The Sad Cafe'- Vanessa Redgrave, Keith Carradine.

It was almost a complete zero;  even the makeup was poor.  The purple eyeshadow on Duvall didn't convey age as much as make him look like a grandpa closet queen.",1005436800,3,338,4.403225806451613

When the movie ended, I was left wonder--what did you just watch? I think Duvall should erase his name from the movie and hope no one else watches it. Poor writing; poor dialouge; poor acting; poor storyline.",1360886400,2,378,4.8307692307692305

570035,4,6303106773,"Not being a huge theater fan, I had never heard of Horton Foote until someone shared an article about him with me. The only film based upon his plays that Netflix streaming offered was this, so we chose it. And enjoyed it immensely. I think it would be a dry and exasperating play to read, but in the hands of two masters, Duvall and Jones, and a surprisingly effective kid, wow, what a treat. This is the story of an unhappy man losing his mind, and the oppressed, distressed and outguessed people around him, wondering why they are dependent upon him, and how their futures will shake out after his death.

Nothing startling, nothing exhilarating, just a tender tale beautifully photographed, with utterly astonishing acting. Duvall is amazing...he imbues this irritable and cantankerous grump with just enough humor and sparkle to make us like him despite his enormous offensiveness. And Jones is better here than in anything else I've seen. Understated and powerful, convincing and delightful. And the rest of the cast works perfectly. Well worth your time.",1351296000,2,1061,4.96067415730337
570036,5,6303106773,"I'm a big Robert Duvall fan probably because he's been selective with the stories, and this was definitely the case with 'Convicts.'  It's wonderful if you like period history, great acting, directing and cinematography, and enjoy being surprised by grand metaphors towards the end.  A young Lukas Hass, James Earl Jones and others made a great supporting cast.",1350259200,,361,5.206896551724138
570037,5,6303106773,"I rented this and found it very uneasy to sit through.  Days later, it still runs through my awareness, usually the mark of an extraordinary film.

Robert Duvall is flat-out exceptional.  Hell, all the acting was incredible.  Duvall's character, Sol, is reaching the end of his life.  The boy, Horace is just beginning his.  Sol, a Confederate veteran, runs a broken down sugarcane plantation in 1902 Texas.  After slavery ended he couldn't make ends meet and ended up paying the state $7/month for black convict labor.  They might as well be slaves, with hundreds of dollars in fines to pay off and Sol sending the state $7/month.  They spend years doing forced labor while living in a broken down barn with scant bedding or hygiene.  They basically live like animals.  The lucky ones get promoted to ""trustee"" after several years.  While they probably eat and sleep better as trustees, they're still bound to carry out every whim of the senile Sol.  If that's anywhere historically accurate, the post-slavery South was pretty cruel and depressing.

The boy Horace is working for $.50/month to save up to buy his dead father a headstone.  Only problem, Sol is either drunk or senile and never remembers to pay him.  The 2 other white characters, Sol's daughter and son-in-law, are about as drunk as Sol.  They spend their time sleeping or just passed out in the yard.  Sol likes to go ""huntin'"", basically drunk and shooting anything he imagines, scaring everyone in his vicinity.  The Black characters are basically stuck in the nightmare, depending on the drunk and senile Sol for their survival.  And they don't necessarily survive.  They're at his beck and command, as is Horace.  And for as much as Sol seems to like Horace, he can't remember his name, nor does he ever pay him.

I can't say enough about James Earl Jones and the other actors.",1311292800,4,1849,4.8
570038,5,6303106773,"Convicts is a play adapted to the big screen by Horton Foote, a Texas native (born in Wharton), who also wrote the screenplays for To Kill a Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men, The Trip to Bountiful, as well as the script for Tender Mercies. Convicts is a typical Horton Foote peek into the turn-of-the-century South. Although it is set in South Texas (in 1902), it was shot in Louisiana and faithfully captures the time and place. Robert Duvall's fine acting draws you in and paints a picture of a man who is struggling with dementia (the language is R-rated) and trying to remember better times. James Earl Jones and Lukas Haas round out an outstanding cast. Convicts is a well-written and acted setpiece. It requires your involvement, so if you are looking for the wild west or car chases, Convicts is probably not for you.",1309478400,4,820,4.662068965517242
570039,1,6303106773,"Absolutely, utterly and completely boring.  This has to be Duvall's worst movie ever.  The story line was about an old man who, it seemed, had lost his mind.  I kept waiting for a plot or something to happen, but there was nothing.  The only part that included ""convicts"" was in the first scene and then just an old man's rambling imagination.  Nearly every sentence contains ""G** damn"" in it.  The coffin scene was hideous.

Ok, I sat bolt upright, took my ginseng, B-12 and Acai berry and I still feel like falling asleep it is so dull.  This movie was a terrible.  Not worth watching even if you paid $1 for it.  So, if you have a hard time falling asleep, just pop this movie in, you will be out in 60 seconds tops....ZZZZZ!",1297900800,3,728,4.365671641791045

570125,4,6303106773,"I'm giving it four stars only because I don't think it's on the level of some of his masterpieces like TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL, or his adaptations of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and OF MICE & MEN, but it works so well that if you like Horton Foote, you won't want to miss it.
When you read the reviews, take into account the reviewers. The ones who dismiss it as boring will be bored by anything Horton Foote writes. His work is too subtle to be popular, so if you want a shoot-em-up Western like THE LONG RIDERS or Hollywood fare like SILVERADO, you won't get that here. This is a play, adapted beautifully for screen, filled with nuances and surprises that are for viewers who notice, or care to notice, such moments in life. Foote attracts great actors for his plays because he gives them the chance to do this kind of work that will hold up for generations and won't be tied to trends or formulas.
CONVICTS is in the same category as TOMORROW, 1918, ON VALENTINE'S DAY, COURTSHIP, LILY DALE, TENDER MERCIES, HABITATION OF DRAGONS, OLD MAN... wonderful screenplays that rely on an attentive and sensitive audience. I've seen every movie he's written, over and over, love them all, and wish the world could enjoy them like I do... but most people fall asleep.",1220745600,3,1249,4.530973451327434
570227,4,6303106773,"Robert Duvall, who was 58 when this film was made in 1990, plays a King Lear-like old tyrant in his 80s, more than half-demented, half-drunk, and fully armed. Part of Horton Foote's cycle of nine plays featuring a character, Horace, much like his own father, ""Convicts"" is of a different temper from his more bittersweet scripts (""Tender Mercies,"" ""The Trip to Bountiful""). Here the violence and brutality of the Old South is portrayed in a remote rural setting along the Texas Gulf coast on a convict farm, where the workers are no better than slaves, and though it is 1902, the Civil War seems still in the recent past.

Duvall is Soll, the owner, raving, confused, forgetful, paranoid. His scenes with his employees, Ben (James Earl Jones), 13-year old Horace (Lukas Haas), Martha (Starletta Depois), and a trustie Jackson (Mel Winkler) are rambling, circuitous and full of repetitions and questions with ""I don't know"" answers. It's a Faulkner story retold by Samuel Beckett. While there is much talk of death, dying, and killing, there are also moments of comic absurdity. Viewers eager for plot and action will be impatient with the theatricality of the dialogue and the scenes, but that's not what the film is about. They are all convicts, trapped in a dying world and going nowhere. Only the young Horace, with his education, his intelligence and humanity, and his knowledge of a modern world elsewhere will escape.",1216771200,7,1423,4.953974895397489
