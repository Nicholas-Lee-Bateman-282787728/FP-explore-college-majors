8641355,3,B00IDS1L54,"I love anything Lovecraft so when I heard this anthology had a ""Lovecraft inspired"" story in it I had to watch it. I liked it! The idea of found footage Lovecraft is great and the way they did it really worked well. Looks like it was shot on film and it has that authentic 30's look from when Lovecraft was supposedly in New Orleans. The other films were a mixed bag. Cordyceps Principle and Section 49 had a few slow parts but were interesting. Thing In The Shed was creepy enough and well acted. Blood Of A Saint is a live puppet animation and it is very funny, partly because of the cheapness of the puppets, but some of the writing is very good. 5 Miles Ahead was good enough. It had an old outer limits or twilight zone feel to it. Overall I'd say this is worth watching and better than some other anthologies like The ABC's Of Horror which might not be saying much.",1401926400,4,871,4.253012048192771
8641356,4,B00IDS1L54,"I really liked "" thing in the shed "" Great sound ,audio , quality and the effects . I loved the creepy black box. Not the usual anthology movie where there is a story which connects the other stories, but more like a collection of six short films. That's fine though because many of those connecting stories they make in other anthology movies are pretty bad.",1401926400,2,359,4.454545454545454
