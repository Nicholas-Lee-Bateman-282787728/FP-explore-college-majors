8201592,4,B00004RF17,"This is quite an exceptional video but the fact that one of the most exciting players of the last 10 years is COMPLETELY ignoered here is rather unacceptable. The Great Gretzky himself said that he might have kept playing a couple of years had he had the chance to play with Pavel Bure. Only that player. That is saying something...
But notwithstanding that, have people forgotten how he helped take the Vancouver Canucks to Game 7 of the finals in 1994? That unlikely playoff run alone would have been worthy of a feature here... That dramatic overtime game 7 breakaway goal against Calgary....not even shown during the closing credits! Unbelievable.
Don't mean to whine but...considering how all the other stars of the last era are so well covered here....
Aside from that, I absolutely loved the coverage of the 80's Oilers and all the old '70's stuff (Bruins, Flyers, etc)
Good job, just don't forget the Russian Rocket next time!",1001030400,3,934,4.84375
