2296954,4,B0009KA7AO,"I was sort of expecting this movie to be unfunny and dull after reading the reviews on amazon.  First off I think the made up character Jiminy Glick is hilarious.  In this movie he was not the only funny character.  His wife, kids, and the rude indian guy were also very hilarious.  Martin Short's blunt characterization of David Lynch is very amusing and realistic.  The interviews were probably the weakest parts of the movie. Some were good while some were lame.

This is a comedy spoof of David Lynch movies.  So if you know David Lynch movies you can then be prepared for this comedy to be a bit on the bizarre side.

The one-liners are fast and furious.  I had to watch this movie a second time just to get all the jokes.

This movie is goofy, fun and histrionic! It is on par with any movie done by the SNL crew or even Jim Carrey.",1156291200,3,838,4.280254777070064
2296955,3,B0009KA7AO,"This isn't a typically contemporary kind of comedy. During the first viewing I didn't laugh at anything until about halfway through with the lines ""so the girl next door is the red girl next door"" (referring to Meg Ryan being a communist) and ""fatty, fat person, bloat"" (when Jiminy is blocking a doorway some guy is trying to get through), and thought it's main saving grace was seeing Lindsay from Freaks And Geeks again, but it exists in it's own universe to some extent and it seemed funnier and more entertaining watching it a second time after I knew what to expect.",1156204800,,572,4.617647058823529
2296956,4,B0009KA7AO,"I love Martin Short and Jan Hooks, especially when these two lovable kooks team up. Martin and Jan have a special brand of humor that impressed me when I first saw them perform. The movie was very funny; my only criticism was about the ""cussing"" by all of the actors/actresses. If there wasn't cussing in the movie, it could be viewed and enjoyed by the entire family - young and old. Martin and Jan in their own right, are very funny without the cursing. In fact, I call them comedic geniuses. They have brilliant humorous ability and are very creative. I hope that Marin Short and Jan Hooks team up for another funny movie, and that the movie can be viewed by the entire family. Martin and Jan demonstrate natural talent. We look forward to the next movie - minus the cussing. They do not need that element in their movie. They are just naturally funny. We also love the characters Jiminy and Dixie Glick. The names alone, will have you laughing. I LOVED THE MOVIE OVERALL!
We love you Martin and Jan, and look forward to whatever you two geniuses have in store for us, your fans.
Your Fans,
Norma & Harry",1153267200,,1107,4.458128078817734
2296957,5,B0009KA7AO,"I first caught ""Primetime with Jiminy Glick"" on Comedy Central about a year or so back. It took me a few episodes to catch on, but Martin Short is amazing as this character. I suggest you start with ""Primetime"", but once you watch it, you'll love this movie. Written in old-fashioned Hollywood style, it is a strong storyline and cast of characters. Like most movies of its type, it doesnt take itself too seriously and is filled with hilarious laughs all the way to the end. It follows Jiminy's rise to fame through the Toronto film festival and a string of unbelievable events.

I have not seen a comedy this good in a long time!",1143504000,6,631,4.48695652173913
2296958,4,B0009KA7AO,"I've caught snippets of Jiminy Glick on Comedy Central, but I have never really sat down and watched the show for any length of time.  Still, this is Martin Short we're talking about, so I was fairly confident that Jiminy Glick in La La Wood would prove funny and entertaining - and it did.  The film's a little uneven as a whole, but it has several laugh out loud moments, and it maintains a decent level of humor from start to finish.

Martin Short created Jiminy Glick for his long-gone talk show, but Jiminy is best known for his Primetime Glick interview show on Comedy Central.  Let's say he has a unique interviewing style and let it go at that.  As the film opens, he's the primary entertainment critic in Butte, Montana - but he is all excited about his chance to attend the Toronto Film Festival and hobnob with stars that don't have second jobs in department stores.  It's a family affair as his wife Dixie (Jan Hooks) and twin boys Matthew and Modine arrive to live it up and schmooze with the stars.  Unfortunately, no one knows who Jiminy Glick is - but all that changes after he snags an interview with the incredibly reclusive Ben DiCarlo (Corey Pearson) who is there to showcase his new film Growing Up Gandhi.  Suddenly, Glick's the main attraction at the film festival and he lines up some pretty big names for one-on-one talk sessions, including Steve Martin and Kurt Russell.  There's only one problem - he fears he may have murdered a prominent actress while he was in an alcoholic haze.

This is a really funny movie.  Glick isn't my favorite Martin Short character of all time, but he's definitely one of Short's funniest creations.  Just about everything he says and does is funny.  As an interviewer, he just says whatever pops into his head, and some pretty weird stuff almost always comes out as a result.  Short almost steals the show away from himself, though, with his portrayal of David Lynch, who pops up from time to time to set the weirdly abstract stage for the murder mystery-like part of the story.  Short's Lynch impersonation is truly a classic.  I also have to say that Jan Hooks proved much funnier than I expected, as well; she and Short have really good comedic chemistry.

The film gets a bit racy in a couple of places, which undoubtedly earned it its R rating, and I don't see how that helps the film at all.  Even the crude jokes usually come off as funny, though.  I don't think you have to be familiar with Jiminy before seeing the film, but Glick fans will surely get more of a kick out of the movie experience and should definitely check it out.  Crude, shrewd, shallow - and funny.  That's Jiminy Glick in La La Wood.",1135814400,9,2670,4.520833333333333
2296959,3,B0009KA7AO,"I was so looking forward to this.  I love Martin Short and I love Jiminy.  But this was almost torturous to watch.  It had it's good moments, but it had an equal amount of bad moments too.  Dixie was not how I had imagined her and neither were the boys.  The interviews were about the only highlights.  I loved the Kurt Russell interview.  That was great (and just before the credits roll, there are some outtakes where Kurt is doubled up in laughter - that was funny).  I'm sorry if you don't agree with this review but I'm only being honest and I am a true Martin Short fan.  If I had a choice, I'd just rent this instead of purchasing it.",1130198400,12,641,4.188524590163935
2296960,2,B0009KA7AO,"When  it comes to humor Jiminy Glick is up and down. Glick isn't really funny, instead John Michael Higgins' eurojerk  character provides most of the laughs. The outtakes at the end are also great. If you give this movie a chance, you'll get some laughs (not many though)",1128384000,2,271,4.625
2296969,1,B0009KA7AO,I thought it was the Jiminy Glick Hollywood star interviews but it was a poorly plotted spoof and full of profanity unlike the usual Martin Short.  I would like to exchange it.,1442361600,,176,4.5

2296972,3,B0009KA7AO,I absolutely LOVE Martin Short's portrayal of the hilariously shallow Jiminy Glick. e.g. his interviews on Comedy Central are hilarious!  I just wish this story had not contain so much sexual innuendo and/or crudeness.  So unnecessary for such a talented comedian as Martin Short.,1425081600,,280,5.340909090909091
2296973,5,B0009KA7AO,"I didn't see this movie when it came out; it seemed dumb, but it's actually really great! It's funny on so many levels: it's smart and satirical and slapstick and just plain entertaining.
Watching Martin Short play David Lynch is so good I cried!",1422057600,2,246,4.613636363636363

2296980,5,B0009KA7AO,"This ""filim"" was made in the same vein as other comedies such as Airplane!, The Pink Panther, and This is Spinal Tap. It's not gross-out or full of actors who are trying too hard to be funny. The funny just comes naturally here.

Make sure you watch through to the very end - there are great cameo appearances by tons of stars, and poor, poor Kurt Russell - I couldn't stop laughing myself!

Watch and enjoy - you'll be glad you did!",1376611200,,433,4.2682926829268295

2296982,5,B0009KA7AO,"Never have I seen an impersonation of the great David Lynch so insightly and profoundly perfect. This movie is hilarious if you know how to laugh at the whole concept of the idiotic paparazzi obsessed culture we live in. Martin Short is a genius clown master/impersonator of more than four decades. Not to mention a truly huge heart of a guy who deserves all of the laughs he has dragged out of us all. A ""Tender Fella'"".",1358467200,3,421,4.48051948051948
2296983,4,B0009KA7AO,"This movie is presently available at a very cheap price.  Which is wonderful, since it was a very cheap movie.  The whole thing was filmed in about three weeks.  Roughly half of the dialogue was improvised in front of the camera.  Many of the crewmembers were monkeys.  The whole thing is just one big lark.  You can't really review a movie like this - it would be like reviewing a tub of popcorn.

I laughed a lot.  I grinned a lot.  I smiled a lot.  I ordered a pizza.  The script (such as it was) doesn't add up to a hill of beans.  Well, maybe a very small hill of lima beans.  But it doesn't matter.  Martin Short as Jiminy Glick is a riot.  The Glick character is a classic, right up there with Inspector Clouseau or George H.W. Bush.  Jiminy Glick should be appearing in a string of comedy laughfests, each one a little less amusing than the one before.  That should have been his illustrious Hollywood fate.  Instead, this movie may be the last time we shall ever be able to enjoy him.  I really hate that.

Cheap laughs.  That's what this movie is all about.",1283126400,2,1067,4.287878787878788
2296984,2,B0009KA7AO,"I like Martin Short. I like everything about him. I think he's a great singer and entertainer, he's smart, he's lovable, and he's apparently very funny because he's always cracking up the cast and behind camera crew. He and his style appeal to me, and I just like him.

But this movie just isn't funny. And Glick isn't funny. Short tries to carry Glick with the same funny speech patterns that carried Ed Grimley... ""I'm as doomed as doomed could be, ya' know."" Grimley and Glick use similar speech patterns. But that's not enough to carry this character or this movie.

Short says in the DVD commentary that they improvised most scenes with no or very little script, though his commentary partner calls him on that and disagrees with him and insists there was a script. Now that's funny. But anyway, as the Beatles learned when filming ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" hoping that people will be naturally funny and interesting doesn't work. You have to put some hard work and long hours into a polished script to get anything worth shooting. This movie (if there really was no script) again affirms that truth.

This movie features a lot of vulgar material and I think that was a big mistake. The larger plot and story and comedy style would have appealed to young people and families and Short sacrificed that entire viewing audience for the coarse material and it really doesn't add anything. I guess Short felt an R rating was what was needed at this point in his career.

Very little in this movie works. The boyfriend/manager character was the only one that was funny, yes he was over the top but at least he was actually somewhat funny. Glick is best when Hollywood celebrity Short shows through the character while giving a good natured ribbing to Hollywood giants like Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Kurt Russel (Hanks does not appear in this movie but Glick has interviewed him elsewhere to great results). The interviews that Glick does with Martin and Russel, and especially the deleted outtake footage of those interviews are the only thing that works in this movie.

The production and story were much bigger than what I expected. The plot explanation at the end is pretty good, creative, outlandish, unexpected, and funny. There's a part that was scripted. The movie has good production values, but what it needed was a script that actually contained some jokes.",1264809600,,2367,4.791666666666667

The story has flow, good plotline, great funny acting. All the events tie in together nicely from beginning to end. I actually saw the movie first and then watched his episodes and I have to say I like the movie a lot more although I love anythingg if it involves Jiminy Glick!
