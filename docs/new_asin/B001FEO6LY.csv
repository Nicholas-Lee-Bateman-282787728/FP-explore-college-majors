I think the leading actress Han Ji Min did a super job of acting and was the ""glue"" that kept the series very interesting. I have all four volumes but I was very lucky to get a top quality used vol 1 after I bought vol 2,3,4 at the same prices. Vol 1 has been out of print for quite some time and last time I checked it was selling for $300 plus, if your lucky to find one at all. Yi San has superb actors and has a great storyline that will make you cry, laugh, and want to wring some necks.",1395532800,,626,3.9291338582677167
