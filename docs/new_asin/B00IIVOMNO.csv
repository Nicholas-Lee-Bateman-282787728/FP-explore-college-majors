8642438,4,B00IIVOMNO,"Due to its picture and audio limitations, this 1964 performance of Verdi's Requiem is not likely to be the first one anyone pulls off the shelf. But its historical and musical significance counts for a lot.

For many, Grace Bumbry is the only singer here whose name will ring a bell. Only four years after her operatic debut, she expertly and passionately deploys her gorgeous voice. She's simply exquisite. The other artists may not be as well known but they've long been favorites of mid-century opera fans -- and for good reason. Each of them is excellent. Ilva Ligabue sounds lovely (and appropriately ethereal in the sustained pianissimo moment), Sandor Konya displays all the colors of his beautiful lyric tenor, and Raffaele Arie richly fills the lower vocal passages.

Carlo Maria Guiliani, from all accounts one of the kindest of conductors, may be the main attraction for some. He also doesn't disappoint, perfectly pacing the proceedings and always staying intensely engaged. In fact, sometimes he looks quite crazed! This music tends to invite fervor from the podium.

In short, this is a performance not to be missed. But back to those technical shortcomings, so viewer expectations are kept in line. The image, captured on black-and-white film, is grainy and coarse, as you might expect from a television broadcast of half a century ago. The image is 4:3 and has not been reformatted (that is, cropped) to fill 16:9 HDTV screens.

Surprisingly, subtitles are provided (thanks, EuroArts), although in this case the text adds little. It's the music that matters. And that brings us to the sound: PCM Mono and limited in range. When the massive Philharmonia chorus chimes in at the climaxes, there is some congestion. However, the ear soon adjusts, particularly as one is carried along by the captivating performance.

A CD of this event is also available (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Requiem-La-Forza-Del-Destino-Overture/dp/B0001Z4960/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Requiem / La Forza Del Destino Overture</a>), but I'd stick to the Blu-ray. Even though the image is subpar, it adds immeasurably to the sense of occasion. There's also a DVD release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Requiem-Sandor-Konya-Grace-Bumbry-Ilva-Ligabue-Raffaele-Arie-Carlo-Maria-Giulini-Philharmonia-Orchestra/dp/B000DZ95Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi - Requiem / Sandor Konya, Grace Bumbry, Ilva Ligabue, Raffaele Arie, Carlo Maria Giulini, Philharmonia Orchestra</a>), which curiously lists PCM Stereo as the sound. I have to assume that it's the same as the two-channel mono provided on the Blu-ray (of which I received a review copy).",1433721600,,2714,5.860759493670886
