7935604,4,B00005AQ9Z,Not a bad World War 2 film. It tells the story of the SS unit order to take and hold a bridge during the Battle of the Bulge. They run out of fuel on ammo but are still ordered to hold and pretty much just died in place. The movie is long on stupid sacrifice. A lot of black-and-white footage that appears to be German World War II era Battlefield footage has been spliced in as has some black and white film that looks new. The battle scenes aren't realistic although there is what appears to be fairly realistic equipment.,1508544000,,524,4.25

7935607,2,B00005AQ9Z,"The realistic scenes and authentic uniforms and equipment shown on the cover sleeve were the reason I ordered this movie.  But I was surprised and disappointed to see that the movie itself was not very convincing.  The acting was poor, the soldiers' equipment and vehicles were not correct in many cases, and the battle scenes left a lot to be desired.  I gave up watching after about half an hour.  If you want to see a couple really GOOD movies about German troops in World War II, watch ""Stalingrad"", ""Cross of Iron"", or ""The Downfall"" instead of this one.",1367366400,,559,4.616161616161616
7935608,4,B00005AQ9Z,"I found this one on Amazon. The story of a small unit of German soldiers, cut off behind the lines, out of fuel and ammunition, ordered to counterattack against overwhelming American force. It was filmed in and around an English castle by a group of British WWII reenactors.
I was amazed at the creativity of filmmakers who were restricted by British laws in the availability of guns and explosives, but still able to create an intense and realistic looking drama of men in war, abandoned by their commanders.
There was some decent use of computer animation to simulate Allied air attacks, and the action was occasionally punctuated by original and recreated German newsreel footage with heavily fake accented narration proclaiming the victorious advance of the Wehrmacht.
One critic thought the soldiers' uniforms look a bit too clean. But, then again, I know what reproduction uniforms cost, and those guys aren't going to roll around in the mud with them.
A genuinely moving and involving story, circumventing some of the technical problems of a gun-controlled environment, and using the limited budget and resources to best advantage.
I hope this will inspire other reenactment groups to produce their own videos.",1219104000,,1217,5.151515151515151
