8108526,4,B000EDWLLY,"I knew this would happen.  Josh Lucas's star goes stratospheric and his obscure early movies would get released on DVD.  Some people think this is amateurish and unfunny.  I laughed the whole time; see my review under VHS: for The Definite Maybe (which has long been out-of-print).  It's a pleasant little diversion, maybe not worth the current price, but hey.  If you like Josh Lucas, you'll like this one.  For someone who says in interviews that he has no comedic timing, he's a hoot and fairly adept at doing physical contortions and pratfalls.",1145491200,,548,4.838709677419355
