8517972,4,B007IUEDXK,"This Frontline production from Lowell Bergman is a compelling look inside of the phone hacking scandal now engulfing and inexorably eating away at News Corporation.  It's geared to introduce ""the story so far"" to American audiences.  As such, it introduces us to seminal characters beyond Rupert and James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks:

- Manchester solicitor advocate, Mark Lewis, whose doggedness and keen ear and eye has advanced the story as much as anyone
- MP Chris Bryant and his early role in uncovering police payola (and subsequent outing by Brooks)
- The Guardian's key role - long the sole voice in the wilderness, their vindication is now complete
- The New York Times' role in legitimizing the investigation

The story exploded once the revelations expanded past celebrities, royalty and politicians to teenage murder victim Milly Dowler.  After the Dowler penny dropped, every [non-News International] media channel picked up the scent in earnest.  It's this stretch of the Frontline story that is the strongest.  It's dramatic re-telling had me transfixed.

My only complaint?  At an hour, the story's too short.  I have no doubt that Bergman could go twice as long without any drop off in narrative or tension.  [Indeed, in Murdoch's testimony in front of a Parliament committee, we see Wendi Deng in the front row behind her man.  But never once is her name uttered, nor do we see her role that day's most shocking turn: R. Murdoch being attacked by a pie-throwing assailant and her spirited beatdown of the guy.  I realize that's slightly off point, but you can't discuss that day without making note of that event.]",1334966400,,1633,5.003703703703704
