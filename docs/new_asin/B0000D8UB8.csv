8212078,5,B0000D8UB8,"I BOUGHT VOL.3 OF ADAM ""PIT BULL"" HUTCHINS,""DIRTY STREET FIGHTING"" AND WAS SO IMPRESSED BY IT, I HAD TO BUY THE 5 VOL.SET! ADAM TAKES HIS TIME AND EXPLAINS EVERYTHING TO YOU ON HOW TO DO A MOVE AND WHY TO MOVE IN A CERTAIN MANNER. HE TAKES EVERYTHING SLOW AND EASY SO EVEN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF MMA PROCEDURES CAN EASILY PICK IT UP. I HAVE ALOT OF MMA DVD'S BUT BY FAR THIS IS MY FAVORITE!! IF SOMEONE WANTS TO LEARN MMA I SUGGEST THE 5 VOL.SET AS YOUR STARTER SET.YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!",1242432000,,494,4.103092783505154
