1477247,5,B00005JLY1,"Broadway -- The Golden Age is the finest, most complete document of its kind that I have seen. And I've seen just about every one. McKay's unqualified love of the era is potent. The added treasure, among many, is that he was able to capture so many of the original habitues of Broadway, and his timing seems almost Divine.

Leaving the theatre, I met a friend -- much too young to have known many of the personalities she met as she watched the film -- and she was exhilarated to have learned so much about a craft that she thought she knew much better than she did.

This is a gift and the soon-to-be released DVD will be in great demand, I have no doubt.

I hope that the sequel(s) will be as well researched and as lovingly produced.

1477248,5,B00005JLY1,"Rick McKay's ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" is a truly fascinating chronicle of one man's quest to memorialize and celebrate a Great White Way that is now little more than a distant memory.

The film features exclusive interviews with the most astonishing collection of Broadway legends anyone ever has (or ever will) assemble. Apart from being incredibly entertaining, these interviews are likely to constitute the world's single most important oral history of theatre in 20th century America. With any luck, scholars will be able to rely upon it for hundreds of years to come.

Buy this DVD!!!",1097625600,21,591,5.145833333333333
1477249,5,B00005JLY1,"I love this movie. I have seen it twice and can't wait for the DVD (but I wish it was offered on VHS, too!) to see it again!

What I really appreciated was that it is not just a story of Broadway, but a story of passion and struggle and persevrance. Everybody talks about how it is the largest cast of stars ever in one movie, but what it is most touching is that much of the movie is about before they were stars. How Carol Burnett and her room-mates shared a dress, how Robert Goulet stole silverware, how Angela Lansbury fought for the job in ""Mame"" and how Shirley MacLaine got her big break as the understudy in ""Pajama Game."" It made me believe that anything was - and IS - possible if you are passionate. I saw that someone wrote that it reminds you not to quit ""five minutes before your miracle."" Well, that's what this movie is - a miracle. And it is the ultimate ""feel good movie"" and when in history have we ever needed a movie like this more?",1097625600,22,954,4.184782608695652
1477250,5,B00005JLY1,"I SAW THE TRAILER FOR THIS MASTERPIECE ON APPLE.COM AND HAD TO SEE IT. I MISSED IT IN NYC BUT IT CAME BACK TO A THEATER ON 42ND STREET A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I GOT TO SEE IT. IT WAS ALL SOLD OUT AND THE AUDIENCE WENT APE. CLAPPING, LAUGHING, CHEERING & STANDING ""O"" FOR THE DIRECTOR AND TONY ROBERTS WHO TALKED AFTER. I HAVE ORDERED THIS DVD AND CAN NOT WAIT TO SEE ALL THESE GREAT STARS IN THIS FILM OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEN SEE THE YOUNG ONES LIKE ALAN CUMMING AND JASON ALEXANDER AND AUDRA MCDONALD THAT THEY SAID ARE ON THE DVD. HURRY UP! CHRISTMAS IS COMING EARLY THIS YEAR!",1097539200,18,580,4.008620689655173
1477251,5,B00005JLY1,"I saw this movie at a theatre in NYC and was completely dumb-struck with the truth and spirit of this film! It shows that Mr. McKay has an in-depth background in the world of entertainment. Not only in film, but in the foundation of Broadway, and the soul of the entertainment business and community.

This is proven by the fact that he reached so many famous stars from all over the world and that they came to him to be part of this movie as his idea was so magnanimous in its scope.

The resulting film is a mindful and heartfelt achievement representing the truth of the golden age of Broadway. It is the story of  a great passion that will connect universally with anyone who likes ANY form of entertainment - TV, Movies, Music, Stage, etc. - it is a must see!",1097452800,18,765,4.335664335664336
1477252,5,B00005JLY1,"I am a total ""Wicked"" junkie and thought the sun rose and set on Idina Menzel but I am now thinking I was born in the WRONG AGE! My parents took me to this film and I was totally against seeing it as I thought it was too corny for words but now I just SO INSPIRED. Part of me was way depressed after as I thought I had missed the greatest time in history, but now I am inspired to learn all I can. Elaine Stitch?! Ohmygod! How cool is SHE? I have now seen ""At Liberty"" (same director, Rick McKay?) like three times, too.

I have never sat on the edge of my seat for two hours like this. At the end I was crying my eyes out and then the AMAZING credits started with people singing and I found myself laughing with tears running down at the same time. These STARS are unbelievable.

This movie also makes me mad. Mad that it costs like $70 for cheap seats and $100 for top seats for ""Wicked"" or ""Hairspray"" and this movies talks about how 50 years ago cheap seats in the broadway theater were cheaper than going to the movies. How did THAT happen? I mean it is sinful.

What was totally cool is that everybody -- and I mean strangers -- were talking to each other in the lobby of the theater after. It was like we had all seen something magical. I had no idea until I read this other review (sour grapes, me thinks) that the director was singing the title song. I don't know how we would know, But, I am now even MORE impressed! I mean the singing was great. But, I didn't pay that much attention to it. But, I DID pay enough attention to the fact that he was a one-man-movie studio and made the whole movie himself. And he sang the title song too?! Whoa! You GO dude!

Only one request:  PLEASE put IDINA MENZEL in the sequel! THANX!!!!",1097280000,21,1735,4.106194690265487
1477253,5,B00005JLY1,"This film is absolutely wonderful. I first saw it in a theater and was stunned by the effect it had on me and the audience around me. I don't know when, if ever, I have experience an audience cheering spontaneously throughout a movie. And this was the middle of the afternoon on a weekday. At the end the audience stood and applauded. But, the DVD is even better. The archival footage looks beautiful on the DVD. Wonderful to see Angela Lansbury in ""Mame,"" Kim Stanley and Elaine Stritch in ""Bus Stop,""  Ben Gazzara in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" John Raitt in ""Carousel"" and the impossible footage of Laurette Taylor coming to life on camera. The footage of Times Square in color in the 40's was staggering. This is truly the closest one could get to get to getting in a time machine and going to the theatre 50 years ago.

I am not sure what I liked more: the amazing performance footage, the film of NYC back in time, or the interviews. To see & hear Shirley MacLaine, Jerry Orbach, Carol Channing, Julie Harris, Charles Nelson Reilly, Carol Burnett, Kaye Ballard, Bea Arthur, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Fred Ebb, Jeremy Irons, Alec Baldwin and I can't even tell you how many more telling these heart-felt stories is just moving beyond imagination. I felt like I was able to sit right with these people and have them tell me what it was like to be there.

I also saw the PBS series ""Broadway: The American Musical"" and was a bit disappointed. BUT, that may not be their fault. Perhaps it is because I saw this film first and it is not fair to hold PBS up to comparison. The PBS series is very ""officious"" and ""correct"" and feels a bit like a lecture. And that may be just what some people want in a documentary. But, I will take an opportunity to sit with 100 great stars who tell me how it really was and the chance to see them all finishing each others sentences, laughing and crying and remembering a time that is sadly only a memory. And showing me the actual perfomances to boot.

Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson says on camera on the DVD that it is so important that one filmmaker (Rick Mckay) did this amazing film on his own and preserved it all before it was gone. I can see why the man who created the Lord of the Rings trilogy was so impressed! And why the film has won like 15 Best Film Award. Don't miss it. Period.",1097280000,22,2338,4.380184331797235

1477380,4,B00005JLY1,"I have been a theatre enthusiast since I can remember my first show at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey. For my fourteenth birthday, I wanted to see a Broadway show which meant a trip to the city with my mother and sister. We got tickets to see Jim Dale in the musical, ""Me and My Girl,"" at the Marriott Theatre in Times Square, New York. It was my first Broadway show and an unforgettable memory. There were other Broadway memories from sitting in the audience to come.

This documentary reminds me of those shows that I was able to see. Sadly, Broadway has become quite expensive for the ordinary person. I have become interested in regional theatre where it is both affordable and offers high quality performances. I was lucky to see Jim Dale who replaced Tony winner Robert Lindsay. Jim Dale has become the voice of Harry Potter audio books and honored by the Queen and inducted into the Theatre Hall of Fame. I did get to see Neil Simon's ""Lost in Yonkers"" with the original cast including Tony Winners Irene Worth CBE, Kevin Spacey KBE, and Mercedes Ruehl with my theatre class. I saw ""Les Miserables"" twice and it is my favorite musical; ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with Marc Jacoby; ""Spamalot"" with Clay Aiken and Jonathan Hadary; ""Will Rogers Follies;"" ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Alec Baldwin, Jessica Lange, Amy Madigan, and a then unknown James Gandolfini; ""August: Osage County"" with Estelle Parsons, John Cullum, and Elizabeth Ashley in the cast; ""Guys and Dolls"" with Oliver Platt, Lauren Graham, and Mary Testa who appears in the documentary; ""Jackie"" play with Margaret Colin; ""Miss Saigon;"" ""Lend Me a Tenor"" with Tovah Feldshuh and Philip Bosco.

Due to financial reasons, I am unable to see any shows unless they're recorded. I am a firm believer in recording performances. Believe it or not, theatrical performances were televised for television. With our technology today, everything in the theatre should be recorded and preserved for the future. We would have unforgettable performances like Laurette Taylor and Katharine Cornell, the grand dames of American theatre. This documentary remembers the golden years where Broadway thrived and was affordable to the average person. There was something to appeal to everybody. This documentary reminds us of those years and yearning for another golden age of theatre.

Sure Broadway appears to be the theatrical capital of America but mainstream Broadway's purpose is to make money and profit. When the actors talk about the chandelier in ""Phantom of the Opera"" or the helicopter in ""Miss Saigon,"" they become somewhat vain and unrealistic about people's expectations. Since this documentary first aired in 2003, the cell phones have become a major obstacle in getting audience's undivided attention.

I bought this DVD for Bonnie Franklin and sadly she is not in this installment but an upcoming sequel in the works in 2016. I did see her in the ending credits about the second documentary. I enjoyed watching the Broadway legends interviewed and seeing rare footage of Katharine Cornell and Laurette Taylor. Tony Randall named his daughter after Laurette. I loved watching Elaine Stritch; Tovah Feldshuh; Barbara Cook; Elizabeth Ashley; Eli Wallach; Anne Jackson; Rosemary Harris; and more. There are plenty of familiar faces and you hope to see more in the upcoming documentary.

The DVD has plenty of extra especially the opening in Los Angeles, California and in New York City in the after parties at Sardis. There can never be enough of the Broadway memories and still not get enough.",1449100800,4,3576,5.013468013468014

And the truth about what happened to Shirley McLaine that fateful performance - from Shirley herself!

1477700,5,B00005JLY1,"""Broadway: The Golden Age"" (2004) gathers together a group of older Broadway luminaries (many of them now dead or ailing), and they bemoan the death of Broadway. The Golden Age was wonderful, but they say it's all over. The movie charts the Golden Age from about World War II up until about 1968. Except if in 2010 you look at the list of shows playing, Broadway is far from dead and is making more money than ever. It is true that we have practically no straight plays running, and that American drama on Broadway is, at the moment, moribund, but that's for a lack of outstanding playwrights.
When these old-timers talk about the golden years, they are really talking about their acting community and the creative people they grew up with. They are talking about how the economics of Broadway has changed, and how special effects, miking, and technical innovations have revolutionized Broadway.
To many of them Laurette Taylor (""The Glass Menagerie""), Kim Stanley, and Marlon Brando were the greatest actors they'd ever seen mainly because they were so natural and so unactorish. There's a lot of humor in this reminiscing, and it brings back many wonderful memories for me because I lived through this era. They emphasized the importance of touring in the old days. The big stars hit the road every summer and after successful runs on Broadway.
There's a lot about the hang-outs these stars frequented when they were climbing to the top: Sardi's, Gray's drugstore, Howard Johnson's, Downey's restaurant, the Automat.
Angela Lansdury describes how she connived with Jerry Herman to star in ""Mame"". To many of them the death knell of the American musical was ""Hair"". This is a documentary as much about generational differences as it is about Broadway as an institution.
You will recognize the scores of stars who are giving their opinions, and seeing them again is a delight: Charles Nelson Reilly, Carol Channing, Al Hirschfeld, Jerry Herman, Stephen Sondheim, Maureen Stapleton, Ben Gazzara, Hal Prince, Jerry Orbach, Carol Burnett, Gwen Verdon, and, oh, so many more.
Theater is live. What happens that one day is never seen again. In almost all cases we have no film record of the great Broadway performances. They are all lost forever. They are simply memories, and now we are losing the people who were there.
This a great movie of nostalgia for anyone who lived in that era or who wants to learn about it. The Broadway muscal is not dead, but the great American drama of that period is gone except on the printed page or in some inferior movie versions.",1284940800,3,2561,4.862700228832952
1477701,5,B00005JLY1,"It's a Great Documentary! The name of the film is Broadway: The Golden Age. It is specific to Broadway Shows or Broadway Shows that started out of town and moved to Broadway. Scott Miller says, in so many words, not to waste your time and save your money on an earlier posted comment. Scott Miller spends most of his career bashing the classics and praising the MUNY in St Louis. As a matter of fact, Mack and Mabel was destroyed when it played at the MUNY after successful out of town tryouts in LA, because the theater was too damn big and the actors had to scream to be heard. It never recovered until it was revived years later. The MUNY is no more interesting or special than other huge theaters that exist throughout the country. As for his comments about Irving Berlin: White Christmas, Easter Parade, There's No Business Like Show Business, Heat Wave, God Bless America, and Always, will remain entrenched in our popular culture long after the songs of Shrek the Musical, The Color Purple, and Light in the Piazza are long forgotten. Annie Get Your Gun is a classic - It might come off as politically incorrect or sexist to the PC police, but it was a solid, well constructed hit with great songs by Irving Berlin and a book by Dorothy & Herbert Fields. It is done in revivals, High Schools, Colleges, and Community Theaters for that very reason. It is universal. Hair on the other hand is also fun, but it is a nostalgic look at an era with references to things that are already long forgotten. Many of the musicals and revues of the thirties don't hold up for that very reason as well, but many of the songs are still remembered because they are also universal. ON BROADWAY, the golden age of the 40s thru the 60s existed because there were was an artistic movement that was part of the popular culture of the time. They had a plethora of well constructed books and scores that were universal and entertaining to the masses and discriminating critics alike. The original cast album of My Fair Lady sold millions of albums for a reason. Golden Age Musical like My Fair Lady, the King and I, Oklahoma, Guys and Dolls, Kiss Me Kate, Annie Get Your Gun, Hello, Dolly!, Fiddler on the Roof, Gypsy, Carousel, South Pacific, and Brigadoon will be revived as examples of a Golden Age, long after Caroline or Change is long forgotten. Candide was a flop when it originally opened, but it was still part of the Golden Age. There was indeed a Golden Age of Sondheim in the 70s (only Sondheim) , but it wasn't a cohesive movement that had anything to do with popular culture in general, and not other composer lyricist could create the kind of quality work that he did during that time. A Chorus Line, Chicago, and Pippin also appeal to many, but they are individual successes and do not consititue a Golden Age. There will always be great musicals created here and there, but a golden age did exist that will always be remembered as such from the early forties until the mid sixties. I left out plays. The plays of Tennesee Williams, William Inge, John van Druten, Philip Barry, Arthur Miller, Arthur Laurents, Clifford Odets, and Thorton Wilder coincided with the era of the great musicals that created a force that was THE GOLDEN AGE OF BROADWAY.",1259971200,2,3247,4.571183533447685

I rented it on Netflix and immediately bought it!  That's very rare for me.  I love Broadway and didn't agree with all the opinions in the movie (I think there are some wonderful shows on Broadway now, though very few original thoughts), but that's part of what makes the movie interesting!

I was particularly impressed by some of the stars in the movie.  Douglas Sills is one of my personal favorites and seeing Marissa Jaret Winokur and some other rare interview subjects really made me smile, as much as the typical favorites (Jerry Orbach, Bebe Neuwirth, etc.).

The simplest of all premises-find a couple of stars to tell you about when theatre was a living vital force.  Well those few stars became over a hundred and the rest as they say is history. And not just history, but an important historical document, living and breathing.  Find out what it was like when theate was a regular part of life, not just an ""event"" once a year.  Funny, sad, moving and uplifting.  Also Thrilling and invigorating.  Rick McKay's passion matches matches that of his subjects and it shows.  Not just in the way he treats his subjects, but in the way he and his crew tracked down rare and in some cases unseen footage(I'm thinking particularly of Laurette Taylor's screen test, and my jaw just dropped!)  People we've known in a certain way, we suddenly discover the breadth of their talent and it's just mind blowing.  It's kind of like live theatre's answer to ""That's Entertainment"", and to co-opt that films tag line ""Boy do we need it now!""  Anyone with even a passing interest in theatre, and certainly any acting student NEEDS this film And don't forget to check out the marvellous extras, and make sure you listen to Rick's insightful and moving commentary.

These are the stories from the people who were there.  These are the people who came to New York with talent and a dream and made that dream come true.

1477855,5,B00005JLY1,"BROADWAY THE GOLDEN AGE is a must-see for all serious admirers and fans of theatre.  Rick McKay spent several years tracking down and interviewing almost every surviving Broadway star of the Golden Age to share their entertaining, gripping and often very emotional reminisces.

Virtually everybody is included, with highlights being the late great Gwen Verdon (SWEET CHARITY, REDHEAD, CHICAGO, CAN-CAN, DAMN YANKEES), Jerry Orbach (CARNIVAL!, PROMISES PROMISES, CHICAGO) and Uta Hagen (STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE).

The film is peppered with juicy bits of gossip and info, with Shirley MacLaine, John Raitt and Janis Paige all recounting MacLaine's rise to fame following her historic job of understudying Carol Haney in THE PAJAMA GAME.  Angela Lansbury fighting tool and nail for the role of MAME and Lainie Kazan being replaced by one of her closest friends, Michele Lee, in SEESAW.

I almost fell out of my chair when rare filmed footage of Ethel Merman in GYPSY and Angela Lansbury in MAME flashed (all-too-briefly) across the screen, and howled with laughter at some of the jokes cracked by Elaine Stritch and Robert Morse.

This release should be a mandatory purchase for anyone who cares about theatre.  I was so moved by the end that I was speechless....I'm still speechless.  This is more than a documentary, it's a life-changing experience.",1105920000,140,1347,5.232558139534884

Since then, I have seen it in 5 theaters in 3 cities, and each time the audience laughed, and the audience wept, and the audience did not want to leave the Q and A with the filmmaker...this is because THE FILM IS MAGIC AND MR. MCKAY IS CHARISMATIC!

So NOW you should buy the DVD...you can see the film, and then see it again with Mr. McKay's commentary...from his living room to yours!

1477858,5,B00005JLY1,"This is an extraordinary film.  If you have even a passing interest in theatre-BUY IT NOW!

Unlike film, the theatre is an ephemeral art:  there for an instant and then, in the blink of an eye, gone forever.  Rick McKay has documented an oral history of those so bold to have graced the Broadway boards, even with the knowledge that time can ravage their creations to the realm of the forgotten.  He has committed to film a glimpse of one of the most vital and vibrant moments in the American Theatre, allowing us to not only compare it to our own, but to more importantly garner inspiration, hope, and Life from the stories of the past. I have to say, I cried four times watching this film...not in sadness, but because I was so awe-struck, so inspired.

Thank you Rick for your commitment and dedication to this project!

As for the inexplicable negative reviews on this site, let me say this:  It seems that every single negative review shares a common tone and voice.  The complaints issued in these postings seem to me to be the same complaint, thinly re-veiled and barely re-packaged behind a new sign-in name emanating from some new town...however obscure-for-authenticity's-sake said town may be!

1477917,5,B00005JLY1,"I think ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" is essential viewing for students of theatre and of the American arts in general, and certainly for any aspiring actor, director, designer or person who has found the theatre to be the source of inspiration, excitement, revelation, reflection, and consolation it can so often be.

I happened to watch ""CBS Sunday Morning"" today, on which there was a piece about the trend of musicals such as ""Mamma Mia"", ""Movin' Out"", and ""Good Vibrations"" which, though artful in themselves, amount to little more than thinly threaded

pastiches of music by one composer or performer/performers.  The feature noted the passing of the traditional book musical. . . the kind which ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" includes in its chronicle of New York theatre in the '40's and '50's, which was, indeed, a golden age.  As someone who makes his living in the theatre, and who arrived in New York just as that golden age was ending, I was touched and moved by Rick McKay's carefully wrought

recounting of the era through the words of the people who lived it. . .  who created it.  I was also particularly struck by the interviews with Jerry Ohrbach (also featured in ""CBS Sunday Morning's"" end of year tributes this morning), who recently passed away, and who was in the first live Broadway musical I saw:  Neil Simon and Burt Bacharach's ""Promises, Promises"", which boasted a chorus of women that included Ann Reinking, Baayork Lee, and Donna McKechnie, each of whom has made her indelible mark on the theatre in the years since then.

In addition, the audtition/screen test footage of Laurette Taylor alone was worth every penny spent (though truth be told, my DVD was a recent opening night present - but one I'd be happy to have bought for myself and fully intend now to purchase for others): I now understand what it is people have always tried to recount about their experiences seeing Ms. Taylor live on stage.  The footage included in the documentary is absolutely priceless.

But ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" is filled with such gems -- and is a masterpiece of compilation and editing.  One suspects some sort of sequel would be entirely possibe, and I, for one, am hopeful there will be one.  I was riveted from first to last.

Thanks to the producers of ""Broadway: The Golden Age"".  It is a valuable addition to the annals of our cultural history and heritage.",1104624000,23,2379,4.796568627450981

Anyone who enjoys theatre at any level will have an unforgettable experience watching this film.  It is obvious how much love Rick McKay has for his subject.  The interviews are personal and filled with emotion.  This DVD is one I will watch again and again.  I learned so much about stars  with whom I was not previously familiar.  I loved hearing about the star Laurette Taylor.  She had such an impact on  many better known Broadway legends.  Footage of Laurette Taylor and Kim Stanley is unbelievable.  I understand why they both are revered by so many actors. Three

1477921,5,B00005JLY1,"I saw this movie three times this summer but when I heard that Tower Records in NYC was doing a signing with the director and cast I couldn't resist going last week. I thought I had seen it all, as I am a director and teacher of acting, but I was stunned. The filmmaker, Rick McKay, didn't just come to sign, he brought Jane Powell, Carol Lawrence, Patricia Neal, Sally Ann Howes and to top it off he had Barbara Cook as a surprise guest - I mean does it get any better than this?

They didn't just sign either. McKay did a panel discussion for a good 45 minutes and then opened it up to questions from the audience - and what an audience! There were hundreds of people and they had to close part of the upstairs as people could hardly get off the escalator it ws so packed. And did I mention that it was cold and pouring rain? This movie seems to do something to people. A lot of free events in NYC tend to bring in people who have no idea what is going on and just want something for free, but a show of hands demonstrated that at least 3/4 had seen the movie in the theater this summer and the audience was full of ""groupies"" which made for great questions and made it very moving and very exciting.

I bought a bunch of DVD's and got them signed by the very gracious cast and director who signed and chatted personally with hundreds and hundreds of people patiently for well over another hour. When I left there were still people waiting and the game cast was still at it.

I came back on line tonight to buy more and have them sent as there doesn't seem to be any better present to buy someone than this movie. I still find it stunning that it is packed with over 100 stars, has gotten rave reviews (It just won the NYFCO Best Documentary!) and it is still less $ than any other Broadway DVD that I have seen. I hope they don't figure it out and raise the price! And hurry up with those sequels! We want MORE!",1103155200,13,1914,4.139784946236559

1477923,5,B00005JLY1,"Honestly, there's nothing better you could do with your time or money than buy this movie and watch it immediatly.

I'd heard glowing reviews of this movie, so as soon as it hit Chicago I was first in line, bringing a friend along.  The next day, I was back there again, with another friend in tow.

Myself, my friends, and everyone else I know that's seen this movie feel it is the most important documentary ever made about Broadway.  They say history is made by the people who lived it, and here--from his own personal passion--Rick has amassed the largest number of living legends ever to appear in the same film.  Rather than a bland collection of facts, this movie is filled with life and energy and stories--both silly and heartfelt--by the people who were actually there.  You can't beat Chita Rivera talking about the original production of WEST SIDE STORY, or Angela Lansbury and MAME, or countless others.

As you watch, you're simply spellbound by the love and dedecation that went into preserving these people on flim and more so, by the love and dedecation these legends have for Broadway stage.  Your heart aches to be there, with them, in all the glory and splendor they recreate from their recollections.

Quite simply, if you care about theatre in any way shape or form, this movie is required viewing.  And if you don't care about theatre, this movie will make you a convert to the magic that is live theatre.  Rick McKay is a saint of the performing arts and deserves entry into the theatre hall of fame for this movie, right alongside all the legends he interviewed.

The only thing you could possibly have against this film is that it's too short.  It's two hours, and when it's done, you want to sit for another two, and I imagine another two after that.",1102896000,14,1777,4.6210191082802545
1477924,5,B00005JLY1,This is not only far-and-away the best documentary I've ever seen; it's one of the best MOVIES I've ever seen. Rick McKay has gotten hundreds of Broadway legends to talk to him and his camera as though they had been friends for years--the anecdotes and memories spill out of them as if they had been waiting all their lives for this opportunity to pass on what they recall of their early experiences in the theatre. As perhaps they had! A great gift for anyone interested in the stage and the arc of the peculiarly American art form--the musical. Buy two--someone is certain to run off with your copy.,1102636800,13,601,4.574074074074074
1477925,5,B00005JLY1,"Rick McKay's film is amazing. Instead of following a predetermined script and asking the same old questions to the legends who were luckily still with us at the time they were interviewed, Rick asked the kind of open-ended questions that let us get to know about the performers and their experiences in a far more comprehensive way. I wished the film would never end, and it still feels like it needs an extra hour or two. The bonus features including the commentary track take several hours to get through and are all top notch. If you felt the recent PBS documentary left a lot to be desired - ESPECIALLY in regards to regular plays - then THIS is the film for you!",1101945600,14,667,4.475409836065574

It was wonderful- The feelings were real, the experiences were real, the dialogue was honest.  I felt almost like I was in the room with these legends- just chatting it up about their experiences.  It gives anyone who didn't get a chance to grow up with these legends an opportunity to gain some insight into the ""Golden Era of Broadway.""  If you are a true fan of theatre- there is no way on earth you wouldn't adore this film.  I would highly reccommend it to anyone!  I can't wait for the next one!",1101772800,12,597,4.333333333333333

After shaking hands with Kitty Carlisle Hart and saying Hi to the most recently departed Fay Wray, I was just amazed. It was an experience I will never ever forget. I also saw Miss Celeste Holm, Tommy Tune, Chita Rivera. It was totally wonderful! The film was excellent. I wanted to just sit there for hours and hours listening to what the actors and actresses had to say. Their stories were fascinating. Which is what a Documentary should be. Telling the story about what life was like. Giving the ""Inside Scoop"" I hope I will be able to see the sequel to it. Anyone who says this film is Amateurish obviously overlooks the fact that this film will be a classic and should receive an Oscar Nomination, if not the Oscar for best Documentary. Anyone guy who can go and interview over a hundred stars, has to be amazing.

Not only did Rick McKay do an exemplarary job photographing and editing this very important work, it complements the far more lavishly produced PBS Broadway series on a totally equal basis. This documentary shows us some truly rare and valuable footage, and does a wonderful job of getting a remarkably array of performers to open up and share their feelings about a special era. What more do you want, people?! The blending of vintage Times Square footage, the highly touching and informative looks at Laurette Taylor and Kim Stanley...beyond reproach. Ignore the inevitable cranks--this is solid, extremely well done and deserves every bit of praise it's reaping. And it ain't gonna be forgotten.",1101340800,14,819,5.074074074074074
1478008,5,B00005JLY1,"I love this DVD.  I already watched it several times.  I'm not one of those theatre goers who live in the past - I think the American theatre is alive and well with artists working today every bit as talented as any who ever came before them.  Having said that, there is no getting around the fact that the 40's, 5o's and 60's were Broadway's Golden Age.  The interviews here are treasures - Julie Harris, Uta Hagen, Jerry Orbach, Maureen Stapleton, Marian Seldes, Gwen Verdon, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Elaine Stritch, Ben Gazzara, Carol Burnett, Charles Nelson Reilly, Eli Wallach, Bobby Morse, Charles Durning, Tommy Tune, Carol Channing, Gena Rawlins, Harold Prince - these people are legends.  Stories and clips about Bob Fosse, Laurette Taylor, Ethel Waters, Tennessee Williams, Jerome Robbins, Kim Stanley - oh, I was transported to a very special time and place - you will be too.  I'm not nostalgic, though I appreciate the past.  This is an important document.  Buy this DVD - you will love it.",1101340800,13,1010,4.8654970760233915
1478009,5,B00005JLY1,"While viewing this film at a movie theatre we noticed that the audience was really getting into it.  Everyone in the audience watched every scene.  The editing and the interviews are superb! What a labor of love this must have been for the director, Rick McKay.  We knew that when the DVD was released that we had to acquire a copy.  We have friends all over the United States who have seen this movie and thru word of mouth it has become a cult classic in many ways.  For anyone into the ""theatre"" this is a must see movie.  And by all means acquire the DVD as it has so much more to offer than the movie, with a lot of extra footage. There are many movies that you need in your personal library and this is certainly one of them.  How Rick McKay got all of these talented entertainers to pour their guts out to him is remarkable.  It took him several years to produce this movie and it shows.  Now we can't wait for his next movie. We are buying this DVD for friends and family for the holidays.",1101168000,19,997,4.178010471204188

It does not intend to have a beginning, a middle and an end.  For those wanting a big time blockbuster action movie, this is not for you.  But for those ""theatre buffs"" out there, this is THE movie!  Who else but this director could have lined up all of these talented entertainers to share their stories with him? The movie itself is wonderful and then afterwards you get into more details as the director relates how some of the interviews came about.  This will certainly be a movie that all theatre people will have in their personal libraries.  We cannot wait to see the sequeal.",1101081600,18,910,4.63125
1478011,5,B00005JLY1,"First of all Mr. Miller has completely missed the point of this film. Mr. McKay's interviews with over one hundred of theatre's most celebrated and talented artists serves as a uniquely candid and unprecedentedly comprehensive look at a time in American history that will never be seen again.

With or without Mr. McKay's personal insights in the film, it stands on it's own as an important historical document that does in fact reveal never before seen footage and shares first hand accounts from the people that actually lived it; people who paved the way for the new generation.  One of the most important things this document provides is the opportunity to witness some of the most groundbreaking yet regrettably forgotten theatrical performers of this century. People like Laurette Taylor and Kim Stanley, who through their work decades ago are still influencing the new generations of actors, who sadly don't know they ever existed.

I do hope Mr. Miller will watch the sequel, Broadway: The Next Generation. If he does so, he will see that Mr. McKay does not see theatre as a dying art form, just a changing one.",1100822400,16,1119,4.91005291005291
1478012,2,B00005JLY1,"Well, I just got the documentary ""Broadway The Golden Age"" on DVD, and though there are some nice interviews, it's disappointing. Don't waste your money.

First of all, the central premise of the film is that the 1950s and 60s were the pinnacle of the history of American theatre and that where we are now sucks. So many of the people interviewed are long past their prime, and they spew out a long litany of gloom and doom about how awful the American theatre is now -- and they make the huge mistake of equating the American theatre with Broadway. When they were working, Broadway was it, but today there are thousands of professional theatres all over America, doing exciting work! And they act as if that doesn't even exist.

I think too many people forget how many utterly forgettable, mediocre musicals and plays opened (and quickly closed) on Broadway alongside the classics we all know now. And it's sad to me that these people who worked back then don't realize how thrilling the American theatre is right now (even though Broadway is no longer the center of that universe). And they forget that a big part of the reason it was all so magic to them is that they were KIDS fulfilling their dreams -- of course that was more magic to them than going to see a show today...

This documentary maker believes that HAIR was the beginning of Broadway's downfall. What a crock. To discount the Hal Prince-Stephen Sondheim masterpieces of the 70s, the Kander & Ebb masterpieces, the brilliant work of the 90s, the amazing surprises of the new millennium from the New Generation, seems to me to be nothing more than ignorance.

There are other disappointments too. The film maker really wants it to be about him -- he starts the film with a short bio of himself. What's that about? And there are a lot of minor factual errors in the film, like the assertion that ""Les Miz"" takes place during the French Revolution (it doesn't).

It makes me crazy that it's considered such a tragedy that kids today wouldn't be interested in an Irving Berlin musical. Of course they won't! We don't drive Edsels and we don't use Underwood typewriters anymore either -- why should today's kids have to love music from 60 years ago??? In 1950, kids would not have wanted to see ""HMS Pinafore"" -- why is that so tragic???

Like I said, I would not recommend this -- there was very little new info in it, and it just left me angry that all these people have so little respect for the theatre being created today...",1100649600,20,2492,4.576233183856503

As someone who did not have a good understanding of the Golden Age, I found this film to be exciting, funny and moving.  Mr. McKay explains his fascination with the great white way which began for him as a young boy. Broadway legends are interviewed and tell the story of their coming of age, while Broadway itself comes of age.  I highly recommend this film to both the Broadway novice as well as the Broadway familiar.

The PBS film is great for those who want a lot of historical info about Broadway. See them both. Satisfy your heart, spirit and mind !!

But without a doubt see Broadway, The Golden Age and feel inspired and enriched. It will remind you of what it means to follow your dreams. Enjoy!",1100390400,15,595,4.5092592592592595

Wonderfully edited, written, and directed by Rick McKay, this is a treasure chest of information about the  Broadway of the 40's, 50's, and 60's. It could not be more timely as so many of the stars have already passed away since Mr. McKay started this film 6 years ago. There is more than one hour of bonus footage that is brilliant.

It is an absolute MUST SEE for any fan of Broadway, and even passing fans will find themselves engrossed in the stories of Broadway shows gone by and stars trying their luck as unknowns.

Director Rick McKay clearly has a passion for the subject and this is what moves the audience and got the film made in the first place. How else could one man track down so many stars and get one-on-one interviews?

Especially considering all the extras included, this DVD is a bargain. Don't miss it.",1099785600,15,582,4.37962962962963
1478117,5,B00005JLY1,"I saw this film in New York in June and loved it then and I just saw a press screener of the DVD - it is amazing what the filmmaker has done. In addition to being incredibly entertaining as a film, this is destined to be an invaluable historic reference. There are dozens of interviews with actors giving us a first person account of Broadway's Golden Age by those who were there, creating it.

The DVD has at leat 30 minutes of interviews with the cast of the upcoming (I hope soon) ""Next Generation"" including: Betty Buckley, Jason Alexander, Doug Sills, John Barrowman, Cady Huffman and Daisy Eagan. There are also deleted scenes,  one has Marian Seldes on Katharine Cornell - I cannot imagine how this was not in the original film. The movie could have been twice as long and still held up. It's also fun to see the alternate ending on the DVD and the red carpet footage of the NY and LA openings. This is not a rental, you will want to own it and watch it when you want to be entertained, or inspired, or moved, or laugh. This film is incredible.",1099699200,25,1051,4.357142857142857

1478119,5,B00005JLY1,"Unlike so many quickly forgotten documentaries this sterling entry is a memorable experience, both educational and fun for anyone with whatever degree of interest/curiosity in the history of Broadway musicals and its Golden Age talent. Since so many of these celebrities are at the age where they soon might not be with us, it is a godsend to have their thoughts on their craft captured for posterity.

This is the type of film where one viewing is not sufficient to savor all the flavor and nuances of the star-studded personalities captured in interview by the filmmaker.",1099526400,19,573,4.96875
1478120,5,B00005JLY1,"Award winning documentary filmmaker Rick McKay, who made the definate profile of Elaine Stritch for PBS's ""Egg"" series, has created one of the most illuminating, exhilaring and memorable movies of the year.  After World War II America's great playwrights were writing their best plays, Ethel Merman was in her prime and talented aspiring actors and actresses flocked to New York to study acting with dreams of making it on Broadway.  McKay captures the heady period with brilliantly selected rare archival footage and intimate interviews with over 100 theater legends.

McKay is obviously knowledgable about theater history and show business lore and demonstrates a remarkable rapport with his subjects.

The interviews are charming, revealing and from the heart, and the actors certainly know how to tell a good story.  McKay has shaped the documentary into segments which address coming to New York, auditions, the impact on young actors of such unique theater stars as Laurette Taylor, Marlon Brando, and Kim Stanley (with exceptionally rare performance footage of each) the late night hangouts, and a myriad of others which zip by.  McKay brings to life a vibrant, magical world that has changed forever.

Unlike the PBS series ""Broadway The American Musical"" which was a conventional textbook-like TV documentary, ""Broadway The Golden Age"" captures the flavor of a unique period in American history (and reminds me of Jan Morris's wonderful book ""Manhattan '45"")in a highly original style.  It makes you laugh (especially at Shirley MacLaine's jest at her own expense), applaud (for John Raitt's ""Solioquy"") and cry (for a lost era and golden age).

What a perfect Christmas present!  It's what I'm giving this season.",1099180800,29,1723,5.301470588235294
1478121,5,B00005JLY1,"My wife and I saw ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" for the second time last night. It was at Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Theatre Festival and we applaud him for celebrating this film and Rick McKay! Wy wife is a musical theatre performer and I am an actor. We moved to NYC a year ago and have beeen out there auditioning. Our families think we are crazy and we now know what to get everyone in our family for Christmas to help them understand how great theatre can be - and how great a movie can be!

The movie theater was sold out and people were going crazy for the film. We didn't realize that the director Rick McKay was introducing the film, which was a great bonus. He also showed about 20 minutes of the footage from the sequel, ""Broadway: The Next Generation,"" which was right up our alley. I actually cried hearing Cady Huffman talk about Bob Fosse in that preivew. I gather that we are the first audience to ever see this footage and that there is even more on the DVD. Wow!

Another great surprise was that Ben Gazzara was there and he and Rick McKay did a talk back with the audience after. Rick McKay rules as an interviewer. Ben Gazzara totally opened up with him and McKay got great stories out of him. Then they signed books and stuff in the bar after. Amazing night.

But, this film is even better the second time. I can't wait to own it. It is just full of details and treats and fascinating rare footage. Ben Gazzara almost cried talking after about the footage in the film McKay found of Laurette Taylor. And seeing Gwen Verdon's last interview with this lost footage restored of her and Bob Fosse working together is so moving. The audience cheered at the high note John Raitt sang (Bonnie Raitt's dad!) and the rare footage of NYC and the stories of the passion of all these stars to just work on the stage. I enjoyed the PBS TV show last week, but they are so different. I think that tv show would be a good thing for my little brother back home to see in school. it is very useful. But, no one could understand the passion that makes great art seeing that one. This movie is just stunning. My wife and I talked aobut it all last night. And again today as we came on line to buy DVD's of it for Christmas. It is a true gift in more ways than one. Thank you for making it and keep them coming!",1099180800,29,2305,4.246013667425968

1478123,5,B00005JLY1,"It would be easy, perhaps too easy but all together appropriate, to sing Rick McKay's praises. We could say that ""he dreamed a dream of days gone by."" Or that he ""had a dream/a dream about you baby/It's gonna come true baby."" Or ""to dream the impossible dream "" It's only fitting that McKay's impossible dream came true, a dream that began while he was growing up in the '60s in Beech Grove, Indiana. As a child, he read and wondered about the neon lights of Broadway. He wanted to know about the so-called Golden Age of Broadway, when Carol and Gwen and Chita and Robert and Ethel and John and Angela and Alfred and other luminaries lit up the marquees; about the days and nights when a seat in the balcony cost less than a first-run movie ticket; about the plays and musicals that had people lining up before the Great White Way became such a fabulously famous, and too often colorless, invalid. Some people can be content, playing bingo and paying rent. Not Rick McKay. In 1981, he moved to New York, wishing for a theatrical future and hoping to document the past. Armed with a camera, a potent Rolodex and unbridled perseverance, he set out to find as many Broadway legends as he could to question them about one thing: Was there really a Golden Age of Broadway? And if so, what happened to it? He wrote letters. A few responded. One --- Gwen Verdon --- dropped by his apartment, where McKay interviewed her with his hand-held camera. (It became the final interview Verdon did before her death.) For five years, McKay persevered, interviewing whomever he could wherever he could, going to England to chase down Jeremy Irons, traveling nearly six hours by bus to meet Maureen Stapleton at her New England home --- and to be greeted at the door with ""Who the f--- is that?"" Whenever the money ran out, McKay hosted fundraising parties and sold his personal possession; his piano went for $1,700. He eventually ended up with 250 hours of footage that he edited (on the Murphy bed of his teeny apartment) down to the 111-minute documentary, ""Broadway: The Golden Age."" A valentine that's as historical as it is entertaining, Broadway pays homage to the parade that passed by ... and to those folk who are today passed by and to those who have passed on to the Great Green Room in the Sky. The flick is crammed with towering theatrical talents from the '40s through the '60s ... a veritable Playbill of four-star names, from A (Abbott, George) to Z (Ziemba, Karen), with a middle stage crammed with 98 more, including Julie Harris and Carol Burnett and John Raitt and Elaine Stritch and Shirley MacLaine and Angela Lansbury and Chita Rivera and John Raitt and Kander and Ebb and Comden and Green and Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim and ... well, you get the idea. But ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" is so much more than a talking-head talkfest of 100 sterling legends reminiscing about those 24-karat decades. The film's divided into several ""chapters"" (such as ""The First Time,"" ""Getting the Job,""  ""The Days of Out-of-Town Previews""), and McKay intercuts memories with music, rare archival footage, home movies, newsreels, videotapes and film clips and theatrical trailers. Some of the footage is exceedingly rare: I gasped when viewing Laurette Taylor in her 1938 screen test for David O. Selznick, the only existing sound film she ever made. I cried while watching Bob Fosse assisting his then-wife Gwen Verdon in a ""Whatever Lola Wants"" run through from ""Damn Yankees."" Ben Gazzara as Brick in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" mesmerized me in footage everyone (including the actor) was certain did not exist. The stories told are passionate and priceless. Some will break your heart. Some will make you weep. Others amuse, few annoy. The actors talk about first jobs, missed roles, big breaks, empty stomachs and emptier pockets, disappointment and despair, being hired and fired, hope and honor, famous co-stars (and sometimes bedmates), out-of-town try-outs and the days when performers didn't need microphones. They talk from their hearts and souls as only show folk do. Ben Gazzara talks about his alcohol-sodden affair with Elaine Stritch and muses (in a most loving way): ""You'd look at her and think, 'How much can one person drink?'"" Later, when most of the then-struggling artists remember the days of hanging out at Walgreens, Stritch barks: ""I never went through that drugstore period,. I went to saloons."" (Make sure you stay until the very end of the film: Stritch gets the last comment ... and what a doozy it is!) Marian Seldes cites Laurette Taylor, Kim Stanley and Geraldine Page as the theater's three finest actresses. Shirley MacLaine reveals that she became the first Broadway star to utter a certain scatological four-letter word on stage (when she dropped her hat during the now-legendary ""Steam Heat"" number of ""The Pajama Game) ... and how she survived on lemonade ... with the lemons, water and sugar, free for the taking at the Automat. Julie Harris openly weeps when she recalls seeing Ethel Waters on stage for the first time. Carol Burnett recalls how she and her three roommates had so little money that they shared a ""rehearsal"" dress whoever got the job paid for its dry cleaning. Some of the stories didn't make the cut (McKay is working on a sequel, ""Broadway: The Next Generation."")Here's one for starters: McKay remembers chatting with Charles Nelson Reilly. ""He told me that the night before our interview, he had watched Julie Harris in ""The Member of the Wedding,"" Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ""The Fourposter,"" Laurence Olivier in ""The Entertainer"" and Laurette Taylor in ""The Glass Menagerie,"" McKay recalls. ""Charlie said, `Those films are clearer than my tape of `All About Eve,' because they're up here --- and then he touched his head. That's what you must tell people `that they will never forget what happens to them in the theater.'""",1098057600,246,5882,4.8353174603174605
