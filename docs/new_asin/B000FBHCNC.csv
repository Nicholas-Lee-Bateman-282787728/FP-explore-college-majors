8120237,5,B000FBHCNC,Is one of the best movie I ever watch very good story,1410307200,,53,3.5
8120238,5,B000FBHCNC,"The book is not translated into English - so the best you can do is rely on the TV series.

The story has so many twists & turns, and the acting is so good - as the characters march along their perilous paths.

There is has no Western drama to match it.",1388102400,,253,3.8461538461538463
8120239,5,B000FBHCNC,This DVD was pretty hard to find.  This was the best price I was able to find and my order was processed very quickly.,1331856000,,118,3.9166666666666665
8120240,2,B000FBHCNC,I was not happy with this purchase. The sound system and picture was not good. I am not sure but the DVD from episode 36-40 did not look like the original but a copy. I was so upset that it was not good quality as expected. I was watching series on NetFlix but they were missing episodes 31-40 so I decided to buy it. It cost me more than $45 and it was not worthy it becasue of the quality.,1284336000,2,391,3.9
8120241,5,B000FBHCNC,"The Good:
This series just blew me away! Although this is only a TV series, the director seemed to have taken this to a higher level. The scenes are majestic, the music is memorable, and the costume design is simple but blends in with the earthly tones in the background. The actors and actresses are very comfortable with the characters they're portraying. They're good and believable except for Ren Woxing. He's sort of annoying when he laughs and he laughed too much. The series have intricate plots that flowed really well up to the end and there's a whole lot of character development and surprises along the way. There's also a lot of sword fighting action with a hint of fantasy, romance, and comedy.

The Bad:
My only problem is the subtitle. Sometimes the timing is off, or spelling is wrong.",1270080000,,801,4.680851063829787
8120242,5,B000FBHCNC,"Rented this series from netflix, but the last two sections were not available. So I purchased thru Amazon, and so glad that I did. Besides the scenery, etc the musical score draws you in. I may have to buy the entire series, one review that I read before ordering said it moved too fast to be understood, tis not the case.",1264809600,,322,4.295081967213115
