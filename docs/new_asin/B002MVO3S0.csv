8374110,5,B002MVO3S0,"This is the best live DVD from PC 69, The past and present album contains their most phenominal recently live concert in their home town in karlsruhe germany and david readman sounds more phenominal than ever on this one here. This DVD includes some of their other live concerts from their past including thier older classical 1992 live in japan with original singer andi deris (now with helloween) + all their music videos too.
And to tell you the truth I mainly got this DVD for the oldest rare size it up concert in japan which was thier first time they have released size it up on DVD which was impossible to find for a decent price.
Any way if your a long time fan of pink cream 69 then this DVD is a very special gift from the band to all their fans world wide.

Forget the CD the DVD is way better!

Trust me and get this DVD!
