1662307,5,B00005TPC7,Awesome movie. Brings you right back to February 1980. A must have for any hockey fans.,1015977600,5,87,4.5
1662308,5,B00005TPC7,"This is simply the most moving sports documentary I've ever seen.  Produced by HBO, this chronicles the journey of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team from unknowns to national heroes.
""Do You Believe in Miracles?"" follows the team from the tryouts in 1979 through the exhibitions they played, including the one against the Russians in Madison Square Garden, and finally, the triumph over the Russians and the Finns to win the gold medal.  It includes interviews with head coach Herb Brooks and several players, including team captain Mike Eruzione, goalie Jim Craig, and defenseman Mike Ramsey.
But the documentary also does an excellent job chronicling the feeling of America before and after the U.S. won the gold, including the low feelings after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and during the Iranian hostage crisis.  One of the most fascinating interviews in the whole thing is with Barry Rosen, one of the hostages, who didn't find out about the Olympics until returning home months later.
Of course the highlight of ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"" is the victory over the Soviets.  The documentary uses footage from the network telecast for the highlights, including the calls from Al Michaels (who is also interviewed here).  If you don't tear up when Eruzione scores or when Michaels shouts ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"", something's wrong.  The players reactions afterwards, even though this was done twenty years after the fact, are still very touching to watch.
Overall, I think this is one of those sports documentaries that transcends time.  Years from now, people will still watch this documentary and still cry when they hear Al Michaels utter ""Do You Believe in Miracles?"".",1015200000,27,1687,5.112727272727272
1662309,4,B00005TPC7,"This DVD was a little disappointing because there was too much focus on the hostage crisis of 1979, too much time devoted to personal interviews, and not enough of the game.

Should have made this a 3-star rating.",1014681600,8,213,4.605263157894737
1662310,5,B00005TPC7,"I was only five when the U.S. beat the vaunted hockey juggernaut from the U.S.S.R., but the memory is one of the most distinct that I have from my early childhood.  Of course at the time I couldn't appreciate the full significance of the victory, but as I've grown older I've become more and more impressed by what occurred.  This just wasn't a hockey game, it was great power politics played out on ice, and if you think otherwise, just watch this disc.
That's what makes this such an intriguing documentary, in addition to the expected player background and game highlights, and of course Al Michael's famous call, the state of the world in 1979-80 is examined.  What is revealed in the process is that literally nothing had gone right for the U.S. in the year leading up to the Olympics.  The Iran hostages, the invasion of Afghanistan, oil shortages, etc., etc.  Then, along came a group of college kids playing a sport that most Americans knew nothing about, and they started something amazing: people started getting excited about being Americans again.
For at least a little while, they were America's team, and the whole country's hopes and fears were placed squarely on their backs.  And lo and behold, they delivered in a situation where no rational observer would have expected anything but defeat.
Perhaps I'm being overly sentimental, but even if you're only interested in the hockey, this is a great disc.  The background material on the players, coach and the team as a whole is superb.  Moreover, the build-up to the Olympics is deftly handled; such that by the time the viewer reaches Lake Placid the tension is unbearable.
My only complaint, which I've seen in other reviews, is that the entire game is not included on the disc.  This is not a particularly long documentary, and there aren't any DVD bonus features, so there would have been more than enough room.  Ultimately, though, that's a small complaint about an otherwise superb documentary.  This is a must have for any hockey fan...or student of international politics!",1014249600,91,2046,4.850574712643678
1662311,5,B00005TPC7,"This story brought back a lot of memories.  As a lifelong hockey player and fan, I remember watching the game when it was first televised.  I was only 9 years old at the time, but remember the event as if it happened yesterday.
""Do You Believe in Miracles?"" does an excellent job of telling us why the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team's win was not only remarkable, but also why it was so important to our country.  You will want to watch it again and again.  Just be sure to keep a box of Kleenex handy.",1012435200,6,493,4.157894736842105
1662312,5,B00005TPC7,"I remember the game against the Czechs, visiting my sister at Ill. State, trying to get someones attention, anyones. The USA was up 5-2, then 6-2, it was incredible, final 7-3. The stadium was rocking to the chant of USA, USA, USA, louder and louder.  Then watching it on DVD, those memories flooding back as tears of joy, watching those awesome kids.  They beat the Russians, the best in the world.  But they needed to win that last game or no medal.  What memories, think I will watch it again.",1012089600,5,496,4.477777777777778
1662313,5,B00005TPC7,"This is seriously one of the best sports documentaries I have ever seen.  In fact, this inspired me to base a major oral history project (worth 90% of my grade) on it.  It gives great detail about the background of the game, stories most people never heard, and it's so well done you'll get chills just watching it.  This documentary was superbly made and it really showed why it was so much more than just a game.",1010620800,,414,4.35064935064935
1662314,5,B00005TPC7,"This is without question, the single greatest sports documentary to be produced by HBO Sports.  To a non-sports fan, born in the last 25 years, this event may seem trivial, almost meaningless in a time where the Cold War has melted, the Iron Curtain raised and the US and Russia allies.
But 22 years ago, in the shadow of the Cold War, with Soviet troops in Afghanistan, rising prices at the gas station, spiraling inflation and US hostages in Iran, things were anything but OK in the US and this docuemtenary superbly illustrates the dark times in the US and how a nation's spirits were lifted by a group of college kids who refused to give up.  They were led by a colorful ambassador of the game, whose own mind games united an amateur team and allowed them to take down a colossus of Russian professionals.
The documentary strings together interviews with former players.  Captain Mike Eruzione, Forward Mark Johnson, Goalie Jim Craig all chip in with memories and commentary, as well as Russian goalie Vladimir Tretiak and an Ex-Soviet sports journalist.  It's an exhaustively crafted piece, full of clips of practices, exhibition games and exhaustive research, all powerfully narrated to put the cherry on top.
Everyone remembers where they were the day the United States of America beat the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 4-3 at Lake Placid, NY.  This documentary bring chills up your spine, as Al Michaels screams that famous call ""Do you believe in miracles?  Yes!""",1010448000,21,1478,4.892
1662315,1,B00005TPC7,"With the space available on a DVD, why not put have the US-USSR game instead of just a documentary?",1010448000,7,99,4.2631578947368425
1662316,5,B00005TPC7,"In a time when athletes are nothing but overpaid babys playing sports that are too boring to watch comes this story of how a bunch of college kids to unite the country.  I have been a long time college hockey fan (Go Gophers!) and this story of how a coach from Minnesota built a team of amateurs that take on the worlds best, and win.  This story shows why we shouldn't be letting our cry-baby pro athletes into the olympics.  What pride is in the dream team anyway?  Watch this movie and you cannot help but agree there is something about beating the rest of the world and doing it with college kids.  Maybe someday our country will find the pride it once found that this story tells so well.",1009152000,9,694,4.3076923076923075
1662317,3,B00005TPC7,"Yes, I cried reliving the event, the top sporting moment of my time.  However, I found the nationalist angle a bit overdone in that individual player skills went unmentioned.  For example, the beast defender Ken Morrow, who the following year won a championship with the New York Islanders, isn't shown muscling Soviet forwards  Instead, we hear from the U.S press secretary held hostage in Tehran.  That members of the Soviet team won 3 cups with Detroit goes unmentioned. The gift penalty preceding the U.S.'s 2nd goal goes unmentioned.  At the time, my group said, ""Good call"", knowing our guys needed a little boost.  It was fair.

What I remember: the Soviets partied mightily when in New York, with pictures of them at Studio 54 in NY Post.  They were also rumored to have sex-romped their way through Lake Placid. They had no legs by middle of final period. I asked a neighbors uncle, a Hall of Fame Montreal Canadian, how our guys could win.  I don't remember his words, but he knew the talent and didn't think it far-fetched.",1491004800,,1034,4.731843575418995

1662337,5,B00005TPC7,"Just purchased and watched this and I couldn't help but think our country (and world) is in a very similar place now in January 2016. Maybe worse now in some ways! Just as in the late 1970's, our place in the world is in question. I think most Americans are weary and feeling very beat in recent years. 1980 was a year of renewed strength and patriotism for the United States. The U.S.A Olympic hockey team won gold and with that momentum - elected a true leader as president later that year. 2016 has a very similar feel to 1979. Although there is no winter Olympics this year, maybe some pride will come this summer in Rio; and All I can pray is that the near future proves that history repeats itself, and WE DO elect another winner (as in 1980) and do rise again to be the greatest nation on earth. We deserve it!",1454025600,,817,4.27741935483871

No team or individual in the history of sports has ever overcome greater odds than the 1980 U.S. Hockey team. Undoubtedly the greatest sporting event ever!. Arguably the greatest event of the 20th century. Maybe the American Revolution was greater. The movie 'Miracle' with Kurt Russell was also just as awesome.

People want to see not only the U.S vs the USSR the Miracle on ice game but all the other games.  NFL Films for instance released Teams greatest games.  For the Oakland Raiders it was the 3 Superbowls, and for The Cleveland Browns it was a game from 1980, one from 89 and one from the early 2000s.  The NFL Shows Classic Games on NFL Network,  yet some of the great games from the old days are left off.
The whole series of games from the 1980 Olympics should be included from the U.S. Team, people have these games I am sure on VHS some have probably transfered them to DVD.  Its time for these games to be shown somewhere.",1424304000,,789,4.124183006535947

but this storyline is so powerful and HBO does such a darn good job with this - it is my favorite sports documentary ever created. You will never get as powerful story line from a pro sports team and quoting Al Michaels from the video, ""the confluence of events was so extraordinary, it could never happen again"" pretty much says it all.

You get Live Schreiber narrating, with a little bit of heart string pulling, a good bit of humor and a huge dose of rooting for the underdogs who are also the ""good guys"" - well done",1389657600,,555,4.226415094339623

I remember Al Michaels' excitement in asking us if we believe in miracles. It was glorious then, and gives me goosebumps every time I hear it now.

This documentary takes you behind the scenes of that fateful game, and offers you some great insight on that team. If you are familiar with the movie, ""Miracle"", then a lot of this won't come as a surprise. That said, I particularly enjoyed hearing the Russians point of view of this event too.

A word of caution for parents: while 99% of this documentary is appropriate for kids, there are two F-bombs, and a G-damn in this.

In my opinion what really 'makes' the video is the fact that it includes interviews with some of the Russian players.  Getting their insights and what their team psyche was throughout that game and the Games themselves was fascinating to me.

I remember hearing that the U.S.A. had pulled the upset just minutes before taking the floor for a high school basketball game and having goosebumps during pre-game drills just thinking about it.  Anything seemed possible that night.  Even though I could barely touch the rim, I decided to try and dunk on a breakaway.  I took off and half way up I realized it was true--I could barely touch the rim.  I came down in a heap, felt the ball hit my head and then watched as it slowly rolled out of bounds.

Yes!"" line on television. Now, as an adult that's probably the only hockey moment that I always enjoyed remembering. Who knew that these 20 American college kids with different backgrounds would bond so well as a team. Not only to beat team Soviet Union, but taking home the gold medal and revitalize the hope of the United States in general. I liked the documentry and I'm glad to have it for a DVD collector's item.

I too agree with the most recent reviewers.  It an era where box sets and special editions of almost anything and everything seem to be available, it is really unthinkable that a box set of the USA Olympic Hockey Team's seven games to the gold is not available.

To put it in perspective, when you think back to all of the teams  (professional, collegiate, mens, womens, etc.) that played in the 20th Century as well as all of the seasons for all of those teams (i.e. 1972 Dolphins, 1927 Yankees) as well as all of the players who played on all of those teams as well as all of the individual acheivements of those who played on team and non-team sports alike and you realize that this team was recognized for the greatest athletic achievement in the 20th Century - all for a series of seven games over a two-week period and you can't help but wonder why in the world these seven games (420 minutes of hockey) haven't been produced to be seen in their entirety (and hopefully with some added special features).

With the NHL lockout now to be logged away as a dark part of hockey history; with the 2006 Winter Olympics a mere few months away and celebrating this as the 25 year anniversary of the Miracle on Ice, I can think of no better time to produce such as set.

Everytime something seemingly amazing happened I kept thinking, ""why did they have to Hollywood this up, why did they have to add Disney magic?"". I thought the story was good enough to stand on it's own without addind unnecessary drama. Well guess what...they didn't add anything. All that stuff actually happened. A goal really was scored in the last moments of a game to get them to the medal round, the coach really did make them skate in the dark after tieing inferior competition, the captain of the team really did almost get cut, Brooks really did disappear into the tunnel immediately after they won, etc. etc. IT'S ALL TRUE!! Reality out did Disney, now how often can you say that?

I won't go on about this being the greatest sporting moment in American history and one of the biggest upsets in sports history period because that is already a well known fact. What I will say is this DVD does an excellent job of putting the game in true context. The cold war, the gas problems, hostages, America having a ""crisis of confidence"". It also does a great job of conveying just how powerful of a team was Russia. It includes interviews with a few Russian players along with some footage of their domination (to put it lightly!). Just watching Vladislav Tretiak doing his stand up-get down drills gave me chills. That team was scary!

All in all this DVD does a near perfect job of wrapping everything up into an easily digestable documentary that shows you just how truly amazing of an event was the Miracle on Ice. I recommend this DVD to anyone.",1104537600,10,1691,4.540983606557377
1662480,5,B00005TPC7,"A great chronicle of those heady days in Lake Placid nearly 25 years ago. Everyone seemed to find something they liked in this improbable victory. For me it was the coaching job turned in by Herb Brooks. It may be the greatest coaching job in the history of sports.  Here are excerpts from an AP article about the late Coach Brooks which says it all:

Herb Brooks was behind the bench when the American Olympic Hockey team pulled off the greatest upset ever at Lake Placid NY in 1980, beating the mighty Soviets with a squad of mostly college players. That shocking victory, plus beating Finland for the gold medal, assured the team a place in immortality.

The young U.S. team was given no chance against a veteran Soviet squad that had dominated international hockey for years and had routed the Americans 10-3 in an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden the week before the Olympics.

On Feb. 22, 1980, the U.S. team scored with 10 minutes to play to take a 4-3 lead against the Soviets. As the final seconds ticked away, announcer Al Michaels exclaimed, ""Do you believe in miracles? Yes!""

It remains one of the most famous calls in history.

Brooks' leadership helped turn a ragtag team into champions. He had hand picked each player.

""You're looking for players whose name on the front of the sweater is more important than the one on the back,"" Brooks once said. ""I look for these players to play hard, to play smart and to represent their country.""

Interviewed years later on why he headed to the locker room shortly after the Miracle on Ice, he said he wanted to leave the ice to his players, who deserved it.

Players kept a notebook of ""Brooksisms,"" sayings the coach used for motivation, such as: ""You're playing worse and worse every day and right now you're playing like it's next month.""

But, before playing the Soviets, Brooks told his players: ""You're meant to be here. This moment is yours. You're meant to be here at this time.""

""He was ahead of his time,"" team member Ken Morrow said. ""All of his teams overachieved because Herbie understood how to get the best out of each player and make him part of a team. And like everyone who played for him, I became a better person because I played for Herb Brooks.""

Born in St. Paul, Brooks played hockey at the University of Minnesota, where he later coached from 1972 to 1979, winning three national titles. He was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990.

When Brooks decided to coach the 2002 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team at Salt Lake City, he was asked why he would return after writing the most improbable story in hockey. ""Maybe I'm sort of like the players -- there's still a lot of little boy in me,"" Brooks said. ""And maybe I'm a little smarter now than I was before for all the stupid things I've done.""

Brooks was the last player cut on the 1960 U.S. gold medal team, and unfairly so, the victim of favoritism by his coach. But he persevered, and played on the United States Olympic Hockey Team in 1964 and 1968. And when he coached the 1980 Olympic Team, he did not repeat the mistake made by his 1960 coach. It was difficult and painful, but he did the right thing selecting the players for his 1980 team. And as they say, the rest is history. Or was it really a miracle? That is left for each reader to decide for themselves.

In an interview at his White Bear Lake home not long before his untimely death, Brooks described to the Minneapolis Star Tribune about watching one of his favorite movies, ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""

""You know, Willie Wonka said it best: We are the makers of dreams, the dreamers of dreams,"" Brooks said. ""We should be dreaming. We grew up as kids having dreams, but now we're too sophisticated as adults, as a nation. We stopped dreaming. We should always have dreams. I'm a dreamer.""

1662486,5,B00005TPC7,"I still get chills just thinking of this video.  HBO really put together a masterful documentary.  This is a must see before the movie comes out on Feb 6th, 2004.",1073260800,2,162,4.366666666666666
1662487,5,B00005TPC7,"I was 12 when all of this went down...and a pretty naive 12 at that.  I wasn't a follower of politics and I hadn't even been to a hockey game (and the Flames were still in my hometown of Atlanta at the time) and had no point-of-reference for the sport...until the 1980 Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid.
With time I've come to appreciate what the late master coach Herb Brooks and his unheralded team of amateurs were able to accomplish...and it gets more impressive every year.  With hindsight I also appreciate the boost they were able to give the American collective psyche at a time when our leadership was in doubt (to put it kindly) at the international level and our domestic economy was floundering.  We had a focal point over which we could rally...and it didn't hurt that they happened to be a helluva team of hockey players that were able to hit the old Soviet Union where it really hurt.
But this video really tugs at the heartstrings of anyone who even remotely considers themselves a sports fan...the players from the team even today seem incredulous with the results of their efforts...and by the time Al Michaels utters his immortal line as the epic game with the Soviets concludes, the tears will be flowing freely.  Would it have been nice to have the US-USSR game included in its entirety as well?  Yes, most definitely...but the amount of action that is included is more than sufficient to convey the sense of accomplishment gained from the efforts of Eruzione, Craig, O'Callahan, Baker, Christian, and the rest of ""America's Team"".
Nowadays NHL players dominate Olympic hockey rosters, making the ice hockey gold medal Canada's to lose every four years; we'll likely never see a story like this one again (Salt Lake City 2002 drove this point home vividly) until the NHL gets over itself and allows the spirit of the game rather than its own need for self-promotion and sense of financial desperation to shine through.  Lake Placid 1980 proved what the Olympic movement was really all about...it's good to return to a time to show what the human spirit is capable of.  This documentary shows the best side of it all.",1069459200,4,2139,4.733870967741935
