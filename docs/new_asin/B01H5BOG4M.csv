8764767,5,B01H5BOG4M,"This recording of Measure for Measure is Dominic Dromgooles final production as the artistic director at the Globe.
Measure for Measure, like every other Shakespeares play, is designed to expose the audience to certain ambiguities. Dromgoole was able to masterly navigate through this rather convoluted storyline without making changes either to the text or to the original settings. It is quite ironic that some critics have complained that Dromgooles production left open too many questions and was not bent toward some political issues nor amended with Freudian-type touches. It seems that these critics have not grasped yet the fact that it is not up to the director to clarify these ambiguities. By removing them, the director would sterilize the entire play. As a result, the audience would be robbed of the experiences that are implanted in the play. In other words, the directors role is to expose the audience to these ambiguities and in this way trigger a spark of inspiration within the spectators minds. In this way the play may properly discharge its function. The spectators are supposed to leave the performance of Measure for Measure wondering: Why did the Duke of Vienna wait to the very end to disclose the details of Claudios rescue? What sort of trick did Lucio teach the Duke during their bawdy talk? Why Barnardine could not die while in his drunken sleep? How many dozen moons will the marriage of the Duke of Vienna last? What about a year and a quarter old Lucianus, the adopted son of Lucio? And what is going to happen to the just to-be-born Claudius, son of Claudio?
The beauty of Shakespeares plays is that the answers to all these questions are provided. The challenge for the audience is to recognize that the answers may be found in other plays of Shakespeares narrative. In this particular case, the answers to some of the above questions have been embedded in the story of the Duke of Vienna inserted in Hamlet, i.e., the sequel to Measure for Measure.
Dromgoole is one of a few directors who have been able to preserve the intended impact of Shakespeares plays. He understood that Shakespeares plays do not need any updating or modernization; their impact on the audience is most effective when they are presented in their original settings. He has not allowed himself to get entangled in peripheral aspects of the plot or any type of intellectual gymnastics. He has not used the plays to disseminate his personal or institutional agendas. At the same time, he has been able to use the available theatre techniques, music, costumes and props to make the plays engaging, entertaining and fun to watch. We will miss Dromgoole at the Globe. Lets hope that the next artistic director will be able to sustain and maintain this unique and incredibly valuable function of the Globe.",1476662400,23,2810,4.90546218487395
