196473,4,1578212308,"Who built the Pyramid of Giza, Stonehenge and many of the other amazing structures from the ancient past scattered around the globe? Were they the same beings that constructed the ""face"" on the planet Mars? Internationally known evangelical Christian and teacher Chuck Missler examines these questions and many more in this in-depth survey of one of the most provocative and intriquing subjects found within the pages of the Bible. What are UFO's and who are their occupants and what is their relationship to Biblical prophecy, fallen angels and demons?

Join Chuck as he takes us on an amazing journey through hyperspace, multi-dimensionality and the Bible where he exposes the greatest conspiracy and spiritual threat of our time!",1305849600,9,732,5.256410256410256
196474,4,1578212308,"A preacher tackling UFOs as a serious subject?  Keeping us interested in such an exotic, recondite subject for 2 hours?  How novel!  But he does it and shows his ability as a researcher and organized presenter.  He leaves out little (I still don't understand how the physical bodies at Roswell could be either Nephilim or fallen angels), but covers a lot of ground.  Although a bit dated, it has good, mostly-documented - both historic and current, giving Scripture references I'd never correlated before - info and shows conclusively that this is real and not the machinations of wide-eyed psychos.",1273190400,15,599,5.01010101010101

196476,5,1578212308,"I already have Dr. Missler's DVD on Romans that I used to facilitate a Bible study class at Pureheart Fellowship. My class and I thoroughly enjoyed Missler's teaching of the Word. I found his same thoroughness and insight into the Word in ""The Return of the Nephilim Update.""",1405987200,,275,4.75
196477,5,1578212308,"This is a great Christian perspective on a subject that the church seldom addresses, get this subject out of the closet!",1385942400,4,120,4.761904761904762
196478,5,1578212308,It is impossible to relate the true impact this information has had on my personal understanding of today's look to the future. This simply changes everything. Very well documented! It truly is amazing how impactful such information has been on me and the friends I have shared it with.,1374537600,3,286,4.857142857142857
196479,5,1578212308,Let's face it. Everything Chuck lectures on is outstanding. Try The Origin of Evil. Another oustanding Chuck Missler lecture that will turn you on your ear,1364688000,,155,5.0
196480,5,1578212308,Very interesting and thought provoking reading.  It was the first time I've read anything more in-depth that what there is about them in the Bible.,1362700800,,147,4.88
196481,3,1578212308,This video had a lot of information. I felt it was like three movies in one. It was more for Christians and it might be to weighty for universals.,1356393600,,146,4.068965517241379
196482,5,1578212308,Tons of info to digest. I had no idea that there was so much out there on the nephilim. A definate gotta see movie,1348185600,7,114,3.7916666666666665
196483,5,1578212308,"I am very interested in any information I can receive about the times we are living in.  Now I know that may sound strange to start a review on the subject of Nepilim with that remark but it is not.  As the world draws nearer and nearer to its final days we will hear more and more about these strange creatures, because they have a part to play.
In this outstanding DVD by teacher, Chuck Missler, you will be amazed at the information you will recieve.  He answers questions such as:  What's behind the UFOs? What does the Bible say about Nephilim and where in the Bible is it? What part if any will these creatures have in the last days?  Are people really seeing them now, or are the reports fake?  This man knows his business and he gives you the information in such an understanding way.  I sat in awe at what I was hearing and the proof of it. This DVD is outstanding and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is a must for everyone to have this information for themselves and for those they love. The clock is ticking and things are abut to change.  Great DVD!",1334016000,8,1069,4.257425742574258

7799165,5,1578212308,"It was an excellent presentation for those who have no understanding whatsoever of the subject to become familiar with it. I've been studying this subject matter for over 20 years and I pretty much knew everything that he was talking about already, but like I said, it is a good video to give to somebody who is interested in the subject matter with no knowledge of it.",1454889600,,369,4.522388059701493
7799166,4,1578212308,Chuck Missler is one of the earliest researchers to expose the Biblical truth on the Nephilim in our modern era.  The only reason I marked him down one star is because I would like to see an updated version of this video as it's 12 years old!  So much in the UFO arena has occurred that should be fused into the Biblical material presented within this video.  A must-have for those researching the Nephilim!,1442188800,4,407,4.472972972972973
7799167,5,1578212308,Good,1442016000,,4,4.0

7799172,5,1578212308,"The more I look at the UFO phenomenon, the less I believe in visitors from another planet, and the more I believe in the Fallen Angel theory. Missler lays it out clearly, throws in some science, and you don't need to be a Bible thumper to get what our Biblical ancestors were experiencing.",1413676800,5,289,4.471698113207547
