3546685,4,B001E6REP8,"I had never seen it, wife works at a Nursing facility in Peru, got it to show her staff who assist her, instructional, caring for people. I was glad to have seen it, understood right away. My wife has a ""Good Heart"", she took the message from her long ago viewing to heart. If you need to help people become sensitive to the human factors of care for aged in a facility, it was good. My parents did services on Sundays for old people, I often joined them. Aged, old, need emotional care as well. Examples in ""movie"" were worth the time to view, and purchase, our expense.",1390435200,,571,4.296296296296297
3546686,5,B001E6REP8,"I had used this film in my Anthropology classes in cross cultural examinations of aging and the problems created by the loss of extended family care in our culture. This film, coupled with experiences from my own life, clearly illustrates the reality of isolation faced by seniors needing nursing home care. It is too easy to lose the the human being that still lives inside of each individual left in similar environments.",1386201600,,423,4.888888888888889
3546687,5,B001E6REP8,"I have been looking for this film for decades after watching it in a class during my undergraduate studies.  It demonstrates to me there is always a connection no matter how difficult the forms of communication may be at the moment. The story reminds me of how often we make silly comments when visiting an elderly person (""is the food good here?"").  Actually, the senior just wants to be loved and have a connection made with the visitor as you see the eldest grandson attempt to do with his grandmother by remember special moments in their lives together. She is treated with dignity, humor, love, and respect by her grandson.  The rest of his family are the real losers in the film.  Our seniors have so much to teach us. They are really a blessing to us.",1335484800,2,758,4.510948905109489
3546688,5,B001E6REP8,I have interacted with many elderly people and their families.  I have used this film in workshops to help them better understand how to interact with individuals with limited capacity.  The message in this movie is beautifully communicated.,1316736000,2,241,5.315789473684211

3546690,5,B001E6REP8,"First saw this film in high school ('82-83) when my Health teacher showed it to us. I'd always enjoyed visiting nursing homes but it was films like this that led me to work in nursing homes thru college & major in long term care administration and then a career in nursing. I've always remembered the message of the film when working with elderly- that even if they can't speak or communicate clearly, we should always assume that they know- at some level- we are there & they have memories.  This film should be shown to all children and young adults and people going into the field of geriatrics.  Very happy to be able to purchase it!",1296518400,,637,4.482758620689655
3546691,5,B001E6REP8,"I have used this video for nearly thirty (30) years.  It is one of the best videos in teaching young people to visit older members in nursing homes or those that have become homebound.  It helps all ages to ""get off of self"" and into the minds of the one being visited.  I rate this video A+ in everyway. Get your hanky because I know you will be moved. No matter how many times I view this story--it always touches my heart.  I know it will yours as well. Get one copy for yourself and one to share with a friend.",1284076800,,514,4.0594059405940595

Searched for it a few years ago--my search lead to Amazon--
what a surprise. It is a classic--and despite the date of its creation
it is timeless--a poignant reminder of the cycle of life.",1483056000,,254,4.3125

8296852,5,B001E6REP8,"I have been using this film for over 35 years and was happy to finally have my own copy. While the film is from the 70's it's message is outstanding when having a discussion about the elderly. Since it is less than 30 minutes long, it is an excellent trigger film.",1397174400,,264,4.196078431372549
