4435694,3,B004NCOQVA,"Only part-way through the DVD, but must tell you that this is NOT the concert video I was expecting. There is quite a bit of amazing footage of the shows, some even in focus, and some in which you can even see Jimi's hands, but this is largely a documentary ABOUT the Band of Gypsies, heavily edited and voiced-over. I'll get back to you after I've watched the whole thing.",1302566400,3,373,4.3428571428571425
4435695,5,B004NCOQVA,"Take it for what it is as for quality of video. I like it allot! You will too if into seeing any footage of Jimi. The quality of video just goes with the feel of the 60s & 70s. Really good color & sound quality version of ""Stone Free"" in extras.",1460419200,,245,3.823529411764706
4435696,3,B004NCOQVA,Black and White Concert footage. This release is missing some of the best songs from the album. Of course my favorite is not here. They added a couple of forgettable tunes. Sad.,1454457600,,177,4.5625
4435697,4,B004NCOQVA,I've been a  Hendrix fan and this DVD is worth the $.,1442188800,,53,3.4166666666666665

4435700,4,B004NCOQVA,"Well made DVD.  Good documentary BUT centers on ""Band of Gypsys"" period (1969-1970) only.  Great musical shots!  Great show of Jimi's skill.  Buddy Miles plays major roll in this documentary.  Ends at Jan. 1, 1970 concert!",1426550400,2,222,5.055555555555555

4435702,4,B004NCOQVA,"This is the best and probably only footage of Band of Gypsys on film. The concert is why the hardcore Hendrix fan will want this. It's nice to see  Machine Gun performed live with the Gypsys. The bulk of this dvd is interviews and documentory that I viewed once and probably won't watch again,but the concert is well worth the purchase.",1408492800,,336,4.508196721311475
4435703,2,B004NCOQVA,i thought this was actual concert.,1404518400,,34,4.833333333333333
4435704,3,B004NCOQVA,"Well the concert is great!  While it is grainy black and white, the sound is excellent and you can see what is going on good enough.  Jimi is rocking shiz!  Just amazing!  5 stars all the way!  My only problem is that I never cared for Buddy Miles' singing (and he wasn't nearly the drummer Mitch Mitchell was).  Dude, it's Jimi's show...just play your drums and sing some backup.  He is okay I suppose, but Jimi is the superstar.

The documentary let us know that Jimi Hendrix was black!  Really?  I had no idea!  I am somewhat joking but that does seem to be the gist of the documentary moreso than the breakup with Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, the rapport amongst the new band with Buddy and Billy and how it was leading up to and directly after the 2 nights at the Fillmore East, their subsequent dissolving and then Mitch back with Jimi and Billy., etc.  I get that the fact that Jimi was getting more bluesy and had 2 black men in the group does indeed need to be discussed but it was really overkill.  Jimi seemed more about all people rather than focusing on an us and them attitude.  Please tell me about this show and what they were doing.  They talked about Buddy getting kicked out of the band for like 2 minutes at the very end.  His version and then some other folks version.  That would have been interesting if we could have gotten more insight into that situation.  What was the audience like that night?  How did Jimi feel about the show?  We just get a bunch of philosophical mumbo jumbo with opinions from a lot of people that didn't even know him and it was really boring and repetitive. 1 star is generous for the documentary.

So, 5 stars and 1 star...I will give it 3 stars overall.  I will never watch the documentary again.  I will certainly be checking out the concert again.",1388016000,,1806,4.373493975903615
4435705,3,B004NCOQVA,"It's the Band of Gypsys album poorly shot and and badly recorded. It's only redeeming value is that it shows Hendrix being Hendrix and playing Hendrix. Buy the album, play it, and let your imagination do the rest",1381795200,,212,4.605263157894737
4435706,4,B004NCOQVA,did not know much about this show. film quality ok but sound is great. get the cds too. enjoy this!,1373414400,,99,4.0
4435707,3,B004NCOQVA,This dvd is ok. But they should have shown more of the concert and less talking. Due to jimi is to great to mess up his music so maybe put out a total concert dvd.,1370390400,3,163,3.6857142857142855
4435708,4,B004NCOQVA,"Really good DVD, the only complaint that I have is; to many interviews with the band members and not enough playing.",1365120000,,116,4.571428571428571
4435709,5,B004NCOQVA,"An excellent DVD!  Thanks to other reviewers who directed us to the concert footage that was in addition to the documentary.  Of the music DVD's we've collected thus far, this one and the Band's ""Last Waltz"" are our favorites for length and quality.",1360800000,5,249,4.767441860465116
4435710,4,B004NCOQVA,Worth the money. Great addition to any rock DVD collection. Has some good songs form the era and it's great to watch!,1358726400,3,117,4.363636363636363
4435711,5,B004NCOQVA,"This DVD is part documentary and part concert film. The concert video is in black and white and shot clumsily as is a lot of 60's concert video.  But the remastered sound is outstanding, and the performances are stellar.  It's a great reminder of why Hendrix is Hendrix and what a thoroughly bitchin guitarist he is.

Even if you are not a Hendrix fan though, this is what a classic blues based rock band performs like, with players at the top of their game.

Get it.",1352246400,12,467,4.395348837209302
4435712,4,B004NCOQVA,"I've had Band of Gypsies on cassette since I was a schoolboy 20 years ago.  I played it non stop in every car I owned, until they stopped making cars with cassette decks - then I had to get the CD.  To this day if you get in my car, you're listening to Band of Gypsies.  End of story.
Finally decided to buy this DVD and I'm glad I did.  The documentary is really interesting, I'm ashamed to admit I never knew there was so much back story to the Band of Gypsies.  As pointed out in other posts, there is full concert footage in the extras so no one's ripping us off.
The combination with Buddy Miles gave Jimi a totally different sound to anything else he ever did, and the innate understanding between Billy Cox and Jimi is always a pleasure to observe.  It will always be my favourite Hendrix performance, and I'm grateful to this DVD for giving me a better understanding of the history around it.
Could have done without comments from Slash, but I dunno I guess they decided they needed a white guy?",1346371200,6,1003,4.28042328042328
4435713,4,B004NCOQVA,"I was pleasantly surprised by this video. I was expecting to see just the raw b&w early-generation Sony video.  It does include this.  Plus, it includes great interviews with Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, and Eddie Kraemer, among others.  Nice documentary that captures the excitement of the performances on 12/31/69 and 1/1/70 (my brother and I were there for the later show on New Year's Day). A lot of people have put down Buddy Miles' vocals; I don't agree. What they may fail to realize is that, on stage, he was a powerhouse drummer who added depth and strength to the total sound that Jimi was striving to create.  Listen to the other recordings of Machine Gun later in 1970 with Mitch Mitchell on drums and you'll see what I mean.  The DVD includes both the documentary (inspersing the b&w video with color interviews), plus, as a separate track, the complete original b&w taping.  Well worth the money.  Enjoy!",1332374400,6,913,4.7405063291139244
4435714,1,B004NCOQVA,"I am a professional guitarist and huge Hendrix fan. This DVD is terrible! They are always cutting away from the live footage to some person (Vernon Reid, Slash, etc) talking about Hendrix. . There is not one complete performance without cutaways. It is very frustrating. They even cut away during the solo of ""Machine Gun"", one of the awesome solos of all time. This DVD is a waste of money. There should be a DVD with just live Hendrix music... no talking.",1318291200,17,457,4.585365853658536
4435715,1,B004NCOQVA,"After waiting months for the release, a gathering of friends sat before the large screen, stereo cranked, fired up and ready. It was all down hill from there.
Interrupting Jimmy was bad enough, but the racist doing the interrupting have Jimmy crying in Heaven. So awful, I trashed it. They interrupted CHANGES!!!!!
How sick is that?",1315094400,7,332,4.946428571428571
4435716,2,B004NCOQVA,"I wanted a full Live DVD of the Band of Gypsies, so this was quite disappointing.
Should have read the details before I purchased, but I suppose my husband is happy for his birthday gift.",1313452800,3,187,4.371428571428571
4435717,4,B004NCOQVA,"This DVD title, ""Jimi Hendrix - Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East) (1970)"" was originally released in 1999.  In 2011 Sony Legacy re-released it with improved sound.  Even if you already own the original 1999 version you owe it to yourself to buy this new version, no matter what type of speaker system you have.

The original DVD release featured a very flat and unexciting audio mix on the concert footage.  The audio (of the 1999 version) sounds nothing like the, ""Band of Gypsys"" album.  This poor sound takes away from the enjoyment of watching the concert.

This new release (2011) sounds fantastic, in fact it sounds exactly like the ""Band of Gypsys"" CD!  This greatly enhances the enjoyment of watching the concert.

This new DVD also features a 5.1 mix for added depth.",1308960000,33,785,4.720588235294118
4435718,3,B004NCOQVA,"I thought there would be more music but mostly people blabbing about how great and significant Jimi was (like we don't know that already).
The few minutes of actual (poor quality) footage is still worth it (to me).",1307404800,6,214,4.657894736842105
4435719,5,B004NCOQVA,"""They don't know....""
Response from group, ""They don't know.""
Hendrix: ""Like I know.""
Response: ""They don't know.""
The ""call and response"" reminds me of Ray Charles. Hendrix smiles and continues the slow-paced blues number that opens the show: Band of Gypsys -- Live at the Fillmore East.

It was New Year's Day, 1970 and if you weren't there, you can be now.  On April 12, 2011, Experience Hendrix LLC and Legacy Recordings released an updated DVD: Jimi Hendrix: Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East).  In addition to eight live music tracks, also included is an 83-minute Bob Smeaton documentary.  The film features interviews with Hendrix and, for the first time, all four of the guys that played with him in The Experience and the Gypsys: Noel Redding, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, and Buddy Miles.  Viewers also see and hear his protege, Velvert Turner, producers, record executives, and engineer (Eddie Kramer) adding their memories.

The release of Jimi Hendrix: Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East) precedes the opening of the 2011 Experience Hendrix Tour on May 20 at the Las Vegas Hilton.  The EHT evolved from 1995's Jimi Hendrix Electric Guitar Festival to its present incarnation which features over a dozen artists including Billy Cox, Jonny Lang and Keb'Mo'.  Complete tour schedule is available HERE.

Velvert Turner discusses the differences in the three shows on that holiday weekend, talks about Miles Davis's interest in Hendrix and adds: ""He had to do that 'thing' that only Jimi could do, in rock and roll, which is play bass, rhythm and lead all at the same time. How did he do that?""

The new Legacy edition premieres exclusive bonus material not seen on other versions including black and white video footage as well as stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes.  Bonus tracks include an unforgettable performance of ""Foxy Lady"" and rarely performed live versions of ""Power of Soul"", ""Stepping Stone"" and ""Who Knows"".  This is an essential addition for Hendrix, guitar, and rock and roll fans.",1306281600,17,2021,4.982142857142857
4435720,4,B004NCOQVA,"It is tough to find good stuff on Jimi seeing that he was before the time of video cameras being everywhere, and the quality of some things is not very good. I liked this DVD. The footage of the Band of Gypsy's concert is not high quality, and it is black & white, but it is a historic moment captured by the film camera. There are some songs that didn't make it on the concert album. The sound quality is very good. If you collect all things Jimi, or are just looking for something you have never seen before, you should get this. It is worth the price.",1305072000,,554,4.138888888888889
4435721,5,B004NCOQVA,"Any decent Hendrix-fan has this in one way or another. BUT this re-release has a fantastic stereo and 5.1 soundtrack.

4435722,4,B004NCOQVA,"For those of you who have purchased the new Sony edition of this DVD, and watched both the main & supplemental material, myself & many others who own the older MCA DVD of this program want to know: Does the Sony edition differ in any way from the MCA edition(new audio mixes, additional video content etc.) ????",1302912000,3,311,4.473684210526316
4435723,5,B004NCOQVA,"Despite what other reviewers might say this is INDEED a concert dvd!  The documentary is the first selection on the menu but don't be fooled...there is an hour of concert footage in the ""second look"" title of the menu.  Here you'll find the concert performance and in my opinion it's stellar!!  There is two glitches where neither camera was recording..one in ""who knows"" and one in ""stop"" but that is really the only incomplete parts of the show, otherwise it's COMPLETE.

The footage is grainy, black and white bootleg type camera work but the audio remastering by Eddie Kramer is killer...crank it up and enjoy show, it's EPIC Band of Gypsys!  Jimi's playing at the zenith of his career and the musical collaboration between Jimi, Buddy Miles and Billy Cox results in a groundbreaking performance!  Anyone who knows this music, is a fan of guitar or Hendrix MUST BUY THIS!!

The documentary footage is awesome too...a lot of bang for your buck here!!!",1302825600,64,954,4.815950920245399
4435724,3,B004NCOQVA,"This is NOT the concert video. This is the same documentary ABOUT the Band of Gypsies as the 1970 one. anyways maybe the video is in better quality but it's ""NOT THE WHOLE"" Band of Gypsys concert as a pure straight concert. This still is a good documentary about the Band of Gypsies, but not the concert video everyone has been hoping for after these years upon years.",1302652800,5,368,4.426470588235294
8436602,4,B004NCOQVA,Worth the purchase for the newly remixed stereo and 5.1 audio by Eddie Kramer.  Can easily be extracted burned for an upgraded CD (or even DVD-A)  version.  Documentary is worth a viewing.  Complaints about the concert video quality are ludicrous - there was never any intention to release this as a film; be grateful for what there is.  Not for CGI kiddies!,1527552000,,358,4.709677419354839
