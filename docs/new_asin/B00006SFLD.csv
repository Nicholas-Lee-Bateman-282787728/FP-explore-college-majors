1792425,5,B00006SFLD,I thought that this was a feel good family movie and that every family should watch.  This little guy saved all the dogs when they did not have a home.,1312761600,2,151,4.033333333333333
1792426,5,B00006SFLD,"Relatively few people even know about this little gem of a movie. It's hard to go into talking about it without giving away the plot, but if you have trouble getting into the Christmas spirit or have forgotten what REAL Christmas spirit is supposed to be about, sit down and watch The Kudzu Christmas. The little smile it will leave on your face is what seeing love in action does. It's not just a kids movie, although my 7 year old niece talked about Mason, Gaitus and Radar for days after seeing it. Enjoy.",1198886400,7,508,4.414893617021277

7973043,1,B00006SFLD,"This movie was terrible.  I think I bought a bootleg copy!  I could hardly hear the sound and the picture was fuzzy.  For the parts of the storyline I could understand, it was a weak. I tried several times to watch it, but never made it through to the end. My sister who is a movie lover could not sit through this one either. Sorry Kudzu!  You didn't make the cut on this one for me!",1390521600,,384,4.0131578947368425
7973044,5,B00006SFLD,Great movie!  I watched this movie on a rainy Sunday.  It was a great family movie!  My son and I watched it together.,1387411200,,118,4.043478260869565

7973046,1,B00006SFLD,"This isn't a 'cute' movie for kids. Puppies cute? Yes, but the negative outweighs the 'cute'.
1) Mason (young boy) has such a negative attitude throughout.  Nina (mom) doesn't address the attitude saying 'that it's not acceptable; we need to stick through this together and make the best of what has come our way.'
2) At the new school there is bullying that is not addressed.
3) Mason in anger calls Mr. Stevens 'OLD MAN' disrespectfully.  This is not addressed either. Mr. Stevens had gone out of his way to befriend and help Mason with the puppies!
4) Teacher says, ""Clowns simply don't know any better."" (WHAT!) Mason gets an 'one hour after classes are out' but the 'clowns' get away with it.  Everyone knows what's right and wrong.  These students weren't toddlers.
5) Several times Mason says that he 'hates school'.

Not once was Mason told that his negative attitude and disrespect towards others is unacceptable behaviour.
The Kudzu Christmas sends out messages that I don't think any child needs to be encouraged with.
I do not recommend this movie.",1324339200,4,1060,4.834254143646409
