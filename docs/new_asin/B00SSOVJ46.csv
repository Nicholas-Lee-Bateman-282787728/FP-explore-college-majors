8699148,3,B00SSOVJ46,"It pains me to say anything negative about a Gilbert and Sullivan performance, especially one of my very favorites/  Good things first.  The performers have obvious love and respect for the work.  The chorus works very hard. The tempos are traditional.  The soloists are enthusiastic but here comes the big negative - you can't hear them.  I know they are working on a probably low budget but the usage of microphones is not a new concept nor a truly expensive one.  The voices simply are lost and to lose the Gilbert words is to lose half the joy of a G  & S performance. I am very familiar with the lyrics and so my ears seem to hear what is missing yet they are simply lost. The staging is interesting but if you don't know Princess Ida I fear that if you tested the waters with this you would wonder what all the fuss of G & S is about.  Please,  people who do these, mic your soloists and cast the best voices that you can, not your friends and neighbors who should not sing outside their own showers",1461369600,,1005,4.275132275132275
