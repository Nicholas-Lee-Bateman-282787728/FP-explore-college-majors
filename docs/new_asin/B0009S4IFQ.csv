2317402,5,B0009S4IFQ,"Nature of the Beast is the best thing Victor Salva has done, in my opinion.  The writer/director behind Powder and the Jeepers Creepers series has a little-known gem in Nature of the Beast.  The plot is simply this - out in the rural nothingness between Las Vegas and California two major happenings are continuously in the news:  Someone has stolen a million in cash from a casino, and someone dubbed the ""hatchet man"" is killing people all along the main highway in the same area.  Via what seems like fate, the characters of Eric Roberts and Lance Henrikson find themselves stuck together as they each know, fear and respect what the other is.  One of them is the thief.  One of them is the ""hatchet man.""  But who's who is what makes the film so great.  It keeps going back and forth making you constantly second guess yourself while they play a cat-and-mouse game with each other.  This movie is one of the best whodunnits and among the most influential films of its genre that I think has ever been made.  It's also about the best acting either of the leads have ever done.",1251676800,14,1079,4.515463917525773
2317403,5,B0009S4IFQ,"Nature Of The Beast was the Best Movie Ever!  Eric and Lance were Great together!  They had Fantastic Chemisty!

The Plot was Exciting....The Acting was Superb......The Pace was Fast and Thrilling with Sprinkles of Humor throughout the drama.  It kept you on your toes and curious to see what would happen next!

I absolutely LOVED THIS MOVIE!  Best purchase I've made in a long time!

I give it 10 Stars!!

Sincerely,

2317404,4,B0009S4IFQ,"Virtually unnoticed when released in the 90's, Nature of the Beast is surprisingly taut and suspenseful.  Directed by pre-Jeepers Creepers director Victor Salva, Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts provide solid performances in this tale of a salesman (Henriksen) who picks up a mysterious hitcher (Roberts) during a time when a serial killer is racking up a body count.  From this point on, Nature of the Beast becomes a taut character study, and you'll never see the film's twist ending coming.  Overlooked to this day as a suspense gem, Nature of the Beast finally makes it's way to DVD thanks to New Line, and it includes an insightful commentary by Salva.  Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a better than average shocker.",1124582400,17,741,5.0
2317405,4,B0009S4IFQ,"I recall renting this a few years back just because of the two leads (Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen) being teamed, as each are fine character actors, and the premise of a good, old-fashioned mystery/thriller.

As it turned out, this is a taunt little chiller with a great premise and even better ending.  I won't give anything away, but the ending is truly worth the price of admission.  Roberts and Henriksen are at the top of their game, and Director Victor Silva (pre JEEPERS CREEPERS) sets just the right tone.

I'm only hoping they come up with a few worthwhile extras to boot. A commentary by Silva would be a great bonus.

Top notch suspense.",1119916800,21,652,4.6347826086956525
2317406,5,B0009S4IFQ,"The movie kept my attention and I was sure I knew what was going on, surprise ending!  Both actors did an incredible job, Kudos!  If suspense is your thing be sure and watch  Nature of the Beast",961027200,5,194,4.1891891891891895
2317407,4,B0009S4IFQ,"Both Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts give incredibly menacingly performances. Good twist at the end.

I wrote this review years ago and since then I've watched it many times and each time I notice something new in both Lance & Eric's performances.  As a result, the movie has become increasingly taunt & scary for me. Both these actors are among the finest character actors living (got to give Lance top-billing, though--it continually amazes me how under-rated Lance is.) Lance is the only character actor I know that never looks the same and possesses that unique ability to change appearance to fit the role. How good can you get?  Just bought the DVD from Amazon...........very cool......

2317438,1,B0009S4IFQ,no werewolf in the movie though I was lead to believe there would be one so if u are looking for that type of flick don't get this mindless  tale of dullness,1411689600,,157,3.90625
2317439,2,B0009S4IFQ,"Nature of the Beast is predictable almost from the start and would have made an excellent 30 minute show on one of those series like ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" or ""Tales from the Crypt"". Not only is the plot more like a TV show, the production values are also pretty thin. Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen do a good job in the Acting Dept., but this just isn't worth the longer format",1409961600,,385,4.436619718309859
2317440,4,B0009S4IFQ,"Excellent acting by Eric Roberts and Lance Henriksen made this much better than the standard B and kept the tension tight.  Roberts really out did himself as a very villainous character doing his best to intimidate Henriksen at every turn.  For those who might guess the plot twist at the end, you will find it worth watching anyway.  Be aware they are not kidding with the R rating.  Roberts role alone will bring the R rating.",1401580800,2,428,4.592105263157895
2317441,5,B0009S4IFQ,"Great sleeper movie. I've lent it to several people and they all enjoyed it. As usual, great performances by Henricksen and Roberts.",1388448000,2,132,5.045454545454546
2317442,4,B0009S4IFQ,"Not my favorite,but a decent movie none the less. The interaction of Lance Henriksen's and Eric Roberts' characters,was what made the movie.",1355702400,,140,5.409090909090909
2317443,4,B0009S4IFQ,I have to say that the chemistry between Lance Henriksen and Eric Roberts is very very good. I enjoyed the storyline and how each actor portrayed their character. Nice twist at the end. Definitely worth the time to watch...,1348617600,3,223,4.743589743589744
2317444,1,B0009S4IFQ,"You may want to see this film, simply because both of the leading actors give wonderfully committed performances. Unfortunately, in order to produce a shocking ""surprise"" ending, the film's screenwriter blatantly misleads the audience for 90 minutes and then essentially says, ""Fooled ya!"" If you don't mind being manipulated and cheated by an incredibly shoddy script, go for it. But if you want a film that has some respect for its viewer's intelligence, you may want to look elsewhere. [The packaging also promised a Director's Commentary that was not included. No loss there.]",1344556800,,580,5.247311827956989
2317445,4,B0009S4IFQ,"I have always admired Eric Roberts and Lance Henricksen as actors.  That was all I needed to want to watch this movie. This movie is in my collection because of these two fine versatile actors. Eric Roberts and Lance Henricksen are better actors than some of the top actors today, in my opinion. Shame we all grow old so darn fast. Eric Roberts is the brother who was responsible for Hollywood picking up his sister, Julia Roberts, after her constant begging Eric to get her into show business. She later became a ungrateful hypocrite snob to her brother Eric after she became a leading high paid actress. I never really liked Julia Roberts.",1336694400,2,641,4.672566371681416
2317446,4,B0009S4IFQ,"I knew I would enjoy this just because Eric Roberts and Lance Henrickson are in it.  They are both superb actors.  The movie was a suspense thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat.  They both have secrets. Roberts manipulates Henrickson because he knows his secret.  But in the end (without saying too much), Henrickson gets the upper hand.  Very enjoyable!",1304294400,7,362,4.682539682539683

8066043,5,B0009S4IFQ,"Why is this movie not on blu ray? This was a nice, relaxing flick with a clich storyline and splattered with predictability and double twist at the end. I know that sounds bad, but all this makes for a happy accident of a movie. Plus makes for a fun watch. Lance Henerickson was in his prime with this role and Eric Roberts want a predictable third rate wanna-be  bad guy junkie who felt the need to advertise that he was the self proclaimed son of Satan and left no surprises to his character, but as I said, it was a fun ride and very little boredom. I would have cut out the creepy crawly store and lizard scenes because they were redundant and pointless, but other than that, I was pretty dang happy with this movie. Especially for a straight to video in the mid 90's. It was worth $3.00.",1485129600,2,792,4.28
8066044,4,B0009S4IFQ,Directed by a convicted child diddler this movie is actually very well done...it's part fight club part the butcher...for the price you can't beat it,1480550400,,149,5.0
8066045,4,B0009S4IFQ,"The unusual relationship between the two men, along with the quality of the acting and writing, make this highly worthwhile. Plotwise, it's clever, but painfully contrived. At heart, it's a whodunit, hiding critical info from the viewers in order to fool us; and the hiding is, in a number of cases, engineered to the breaking point. The most obvious example is when Eric tells Lance to go see the dopers in the van. The viewers are supposed to think that Roberts is the Hatchet Man, so the facade works fine. But if Eric knows that Lance is the Hatchet Man, he's setting the poor kids in the van up to be butchered. That's both out of character and pointless. Why would Eric do that? You have to look past a number of maneuvers which are specifically designed to mislead us and don't make sense when we know what's really going on. But the film's idea is still devilishly clever and the two characters are worth the ride.",1472601600,2,922,4.526946107784431
8066046,2,B0009S4IFQ,"My Negative appraisal has nothing to do with the movie. I was simply upset that the ""Commentary with Victor Salva"" that is painly labeled on the back cover was nowhere to be found on this disc. The DVD arrived in excellent condition, but none of the three available audio tracks were the promoted ""Director's Commentary"" track. I hope this bit of information is helpful to future prospective customers, especially if you're a fan of bonus features, such as ""commentary tracks.""",1465776000,3,477,4.975
8066047,1,B0009S4IFQ,Pretty bad movie-no real plot and it goes nowhere.  Acting by Roberts is good but he is hardly in the movie.  Lance hendriksen is the main actor and he would have been better with a decent plot!!!!!!,1461196800,,199,4.351351351351352
