6253816,2,B00I8OQ6US,"I love Naruto an iv been buying the seasons the day they came out, but this set was not at my local Walmart so I got on amazon to order it an I look at the price and its over $40 so I figured it must be some really good episodes for that price but..... Its not the entire set is fillers except for an episode on the end. I just don't see the point in getting a season of all fillers for this price",1404864000,10,397,3.6823529411764704

the sad part is that is only going to have one episode of the main story!
and that episode is the last one on this box set.",1404691200,,154,3.696969696969697
6253818,3,B00I8OQ6US,"All but the last 2 episodes in this set are filler episodes. now when box set 20 comes out in the fall, The best part of this series finally begins!",1404518400,8,148,3.966666666666667
6253819,1,B00I8OQ6US,"Not even going to review the content of the episodes, but the product itself.  I understand that die-hard fans of the series will be upset at my comments, you deserve better than this though.  $30 for this garbage presentation?  Since purchasers of this box-set aren't buying a digital copy, more effort needs to be put into the way these sets look.

The old Naruto sets had boxes, booklets, and beautiful box art.  Even the early shippuden sets came in boxes with separate jewel cases.  The presentation being used since set 5 is so plain and ugly that I must give a low score.

As a fellow fan of the series, I ask you not to respond with rage and anger.  We deserve better, especially after shelling out big bucks all these years.",1401753600,14,733,4.5

6253897,2,B00I8OQ6US,Same as what a lot of people have already said. You want me to pay 40 dollars instead of the normal 32 - 35. It is mostly filler episodes. Why am I paying 40 dollars? For the box art? Up to this point I have purchased every Naruto Shippuden instead of just watching it free on the web because I felt like the company was giving good quality and good quantity of episodes per box set. This has fallen off drastically. At this point I feel like they are stuffing my face with filler episodes I don't care about and recently they have even gone to two discs instead of three. This may be the last Naruto purchase I make unless Viz Media seriously changes what they are doing and I do not see that happening.,1406332800,9,704,4.1838235294117645
6253898,5,B00I8OQ6US,"This box set wasn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be, it was a little bit better than the previous box set. Naruto does not reach the same transformation that's on the cover, mainly this box set continues Naruto' s journey to the Land of Lightning. Only the last few episodes of the last disc has him reach his destination & meet the 8 tails Jinchuriki ( Killer Bee) & Naruto finally starts his training to control the 9 tails. He faces his dark half at the Island of Paradise, anyone who has beaten the game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 knows what I'm talking about.",1406073600,5,593,4.4
