The Chucklewood Critters shine in this adorable Halloween romp through a trailer park.  The music is fun and exciting...it always made me want to go throw on my costume and grab a candied apple.  The film focuses on the crazy adventures of Rusty and Buttons (woodland fox and bear respectively) as they try to join in on the holiday fun of trick-or-treating.  A heist unfolds around them, and it's the Chucklewood Critters to the rescue!  It's hilarious and speaks a language kids of all ages can understand.  No violence, no gore, no sex, not even any sarcasm....it's about time!
How much do I recommend this for children??  I recorded this off of TV when I was about 10 years old and wore the tape thin!  I enjoyed it so much (both then AND now) that I went to Amazon and bought the video so I could share it with my children someday.  Enjoy it all year round.",991008000,4,1115,4.619289340101523
