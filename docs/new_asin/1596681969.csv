8108448,4,1596681969,GREAT FOR BEGINNERS who want to learn cold connections.  Gives great basic info on how to make rivets.  Not very detailed but good info.,1415664000,,136,4.625
8108449,2,1596681969,"I think Susan was more interested in selling her book and this was a vehicle to get the word out.  As someone new to the realm of cold connections and jewelery making  I was expecting much more from Susan as she is so well known...however, perhaps after working in the field so long she didn't feel she needed to put forth the effort ... I've found since watching this DVD that there are much better videos, books and instruction on the market today.",1409616000,,450,4.409638554216867
8108450,5,1596681969,"This Susan Lenart Kazmer instructional video was terrific.  Clear instructions.  Excellent explanation of processes and how to use tools.  I immediately ordered some of the same tools she used, including a flex shaft motor, and I'm ready to try out some new metal jewelry techiniques.",1362182400,,284,5.266666666666667
8108451,2,1596681969,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  I found the instructor was not articulate and said ""Umm"" in almost every sentence, or she would begin a sentence but not finish the thought.  It would have been better had it been scripted instead of winged. I doubt I will watch this again.",1307232000,5,273,4.44
8108452,4,1596681969,"Basic riveting techniques, clearly demonstrated. Delivered by the artist in a pleasant, easygoing manner. My high school students enjoyed this video, and have been riveting away like mad! One thing to pick on... she does not wear any eye protection! Not a good example; they had to add a disclaimer. Still, a good video, recommended.",1304726400,,333,5.072727272727272
