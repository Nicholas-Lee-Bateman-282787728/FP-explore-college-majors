8104934,4,B000E372T0,"The DVD has some of the same footage and interviews as the TV version, but it has about half of the content they showed on the BIO channel. Still very good, I wish the complete version was available. I sent the BIO channel an email to request a copy from them and they replied with saying ""It is not available but it sounded like a great idea"" WHAT? Unless they show it again and someone records it this is as good as it gets for now. It is still very funny and worth buying the way it is.",1308182400,,489,4.0
8104935,5,B000E372T0,"I produced this documentary for A&E's ""Biography"" series. It was made with the kind cooperation of John Belushi's family and is a loving, non-scandalous portrait of a man whose talents were only beginning to be used. I'm proud of it, but A&E didn't give us enough money to include all the film clips from the broadcast version in the home video version, so be advised. The rare interview and home movie footage, however, are a real treasure.",1237420800,3,441,4.740259740259741
