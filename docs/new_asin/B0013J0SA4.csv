What makes this one different, I believe, is how thought provoking and uncomfortable this one makes us feel by the end.

I recommend this one be aired EVERY Veterans Day.  It really is a question that needs to be asked, ""What have we learned Charlie Brown.""

It would also be nice if it were to be offered in DVD.",1512432000,,373,4.4411764705882355
8251158,5,B0013J0SA4,"This is a great review of moments in history by the peanuts gang. Little known or remembered facts brought to us as only Peanuts can. Great information for the young crowd, review for the growing crowd & memories for the older crowd.",1511395200,,233,4.571428571428571
8251159,5,B0013J0SA4,"I remember watching this in school as part of the Memorial Day festivities I could not find this anywhere on DVD, so I gave up, bought a secondhand VHS copy from Amazon.com and had it converted to DVD.",1502236800,,201,4.315789473684211

8251161,5,B0013J0SA4,"I bought this video second hand for my son when he was a little boy.  He must have watched it a hundred times.  He always loved ""Peanuts"".  Now he is a grown man and a historian.  I know that Charles Shultz and this movie introduced him to his love of military history.  I still have the video tape.  I am a school counselor and I use it to teach young students to take notes as all the information is factual.  This is timeless.",1458259200,,429,4.096385542168675
8251162,5,B0013J0SA4,"For those interested, it is now out on dvd as part of the Peanuts Emmy Honored Collection.",1446336000,5,90,4.352941176470588
8251163,4,B0013J0SA4,"This is the most serious and solemn of the Peanuts TV specials, very poignant and touching, but it can still appeal to families, teaching children about war. It is well written and animated for it's time of release, and the use of actual war footage and Ike's speech adds more emotional layers. There's still room for a dash of Peanuts humor here and there as well.

PS This special needs to see a digital release!",1388188800,6,414,4.52
8251164,5,B0013J0SA4,"I first saw this way back in 1983, when it aired on CBS.  What Have We Learned shows the Peanuts Gang accidentally winding up on Omaha Beech in Normandy.  Linus tells the others of the significance of where they are, and they come away realizing what the impact of the wars were, and how important the sacrifice of the soldiers was. Standing among the field of red poppies, Linus then turns and asks, ""What have we learned, Charlie Brown?""

Although I was only 5 at the time it sparked in me the beginning of what would become my life long obsession with the Second World War.  This truly deserves to be part of a DVD or Blu-ray collection.",1367539200,11,640,4.398305084745763
