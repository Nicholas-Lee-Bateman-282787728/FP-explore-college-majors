661645,4,6303482201,"Dean Stockwell stars in this icky thriller, based on the infamous Leopold-Loeb murder case which shook Chicago in the 1920s.  Most of the film features Stockwell and cohort Bradford Dillman, as two wealthy, sadistic criminal dilletantes bound together in a twisted dominant-submissive homoerotic pact, which leads them to kidnap and murder a young boy in their neighborhood -- all just for kicks.  Dillman is compellingly grotesque as the ringleader who pushes Stockwell in violence and psychosis, and then delights in taunting the police behind their backs.  This prelude is tense and gut-gripping, horrifying, in fact, but the film loses impact after they are caught and brought to trial.  Orson Wells does a fine turn as the liberal lawyer who is brought in to defend them, and delivers a dazzling anti-death penalty speech, but the emotional  drama of the ending is strangely muffled... Somehow, Wells's character is brought in a little too late, and there's no real interaction between him and his loathesome clients.  The relevant points are made, but they don't resonate as effectively as the nauseating buildup -- Stockwell and Dillman remain unlikeable, yet their sickness and its philospohical rationalizations aren't dug into as deeply as they could have been.  The confrontation of the character's gayness (and their need to disguise it before the jurors) is fascinating, though -- even though the movie was made thirty-five years after the killing took place, the filmmakers make no judgement about the homophobia involved.  Anyway, as psychological thrillers go, this one's a doozy.",1058745600,5,1596,5.330677290836653
661646,4,6303482201,"A well done film about the true crime that shocked the US at the time it was committed, the murder committed by Leopold and Loeb. Two brilliant young men thought they were invincible and could get away with murder, but despite their brilliance, they became arrogant and careless. They declared their atheism and this was a factor in the film. Although they hired the famous Clarence Darrow in their defence, even he could not convince a jury to find reasonable doubt. Dean Stockwell is excellent in this early role, and SO young. And Orson Welles stars as the attorney who tries to defend the boys. The film tells the story of the crime and of the societal place of Leopold and Loeb and their families and does not really explore the nature of the relationship between Leopold and Loeb, which in more recent films (indie film Swoon) was explored in depth. The film is semi-fictionalised with different character's names, but the story of Leopold and Loeb is the blueprint.",982972800,4,972,4.757396449704142
661647,1,6303482201,"A case study of how fine performances in themselves can't guarantee a film. Sure, Welles is magnificent. Stockwell gives one of his better performances, and Dillman, today forgotten, suggests he's worth another  look.
  But the film is a setup, a not uncommon phenomenon in 50's  pictures dealing with social issues. For the first half we get a story  carefully composed to take all the sting out of a vicious murder--we never  see the victim or the crime either. Then we get the lengthy speech against  capital punishment, which must have been rousing at the time but sounds  pretty hollow after a half century of crimes that would have sickened  Leopold and Loeb themselves.
  The result is a broken-backed product  that doesn't even work as propaganda. They do them a lot better these days,  as Sarandon and Penn have demonstrated. If you need your convictions  bolstered, go to ""Dead Man Walking"". If you want Welles, stick  with ""Touch of Evil"". Let this one lie.",961632000,8,968,4.852760736196319
661689,4,6303482201,"Compulsion, 1959 film

The story begins in 1924 Chicago. Two young men burglarize a fraternity house. They nearly run down a man in the road. Artie gives Judd an order. (This shows their viciousness and depravity.) They have a plan to do another crime. (Are they too smart for their own good?) Judd believes in the writings of Nietzsche (he died of insanity). Artie brags about himself. Another student, Sidney Brooks, works for a newspaper. Tom Daly at the `Globe' gets news about a kidnapping. Brooks visits the morgue, a boy was hit on the head and drowned. Was this the kidnapped boy? Yes. The glasses found by the body do not belong to the victim. Judd also admires Plato (another sick philosopher). [Note Artie's behavior in the group!] Brooks gets stuck with a big bill after Artie ducked out. Judd and Artie rehearse their alibis. Will it work? ""Pride goes before a fall"" because it is based on self-serving assumptions.

Artie offers to help the police lieutenant investigating the crime. His advice makes trouble for some people. Artie's conversation shows his depraved personality. Judd also talks crazy to Ruth near where the boy was killed. These boys visit the stockyards where sheep are led to the slaughter. [Symbolism?] Judd is brought in for questioning. Can he explain how he lost his glasses? Judd mentions Artie Strauss for his alibi, so Artie is brought in for questioning on what he did. [This conversation is dramatic.] Reporters gather to ask questions. The chauffeur provides evidence that Judd's Stutz was in the garage that Wednesday! Prosecutor Harold Horne uses an old trick to get an emotional response from Judd, and a confession. Each blames the other. The famous Jonathan Wilk will defend the boys. He tells Art and Judd to say nothing to anyone. [Always good advice to a suspect as it prevents problems from false witnesses.] The defense doctors don't agree with the diagnosis of the accused (Artie is ""paranoid"", Judd is ""schizophrenic"").

Jonathan Wilk questions the two about their personal lives. In court Wilk changes the plea to ""guilty"". Wilk believes he has a better chance with the Judge than the jury. Psychiatrists testify about Artie and Judd. Wilk points out that the killing was senseless, an act of madness. Those who plead guilty to murder and were under twenty-one were given life in prison. Wilk asks the Judge to follow this precedent, he places all responsibility on the Judge for deciding the sentence. Wilk claims that harsh sentences create more crime. [Believable?] Wilk's speech is rhetorical. Would hanging Artie and Judd stop the killing? [No, but it would prevent them from doing it again, and that is why the death penalty has been found useful over millenia.] The ending is suitably dramatic.

This is a fictionalized version of a famous true crime that shocked America in 1924. Leopold and Loeb killed a young boy to show they were smart enough to get away with it (students of Nietzsche). Edmond Locard noted that every criminal leaves something at the crime scene, and takes something away. Writers like Upton Sinclair and William Jennings Bryan criticized the universities of America as teaching anti-democratic and anti-Christian beliefs. Many Robber Barons founded universities to give support and propaganda for the policies that favored Robber Barons. There is often a hidden agenda to many of their courses. Like other corporate employees, college professors do as they are told. Why do universities push writers like Nietzsche and Plato? To advance the corporate agenda of anti-democracy, which is not in the best interests of the students. Some might assume that the rich have no interest in attacking other people, yet the rich got that way by exploiting the common people.
Does the ""Artie Strauss"" character remind you of some co-workers or managers in your corporate environment? Or some current or past politicians? Be warned against them!",1476316800,,3919,5.033898305084746

The two accused University of Chicago students had kidnapped and murdered a 14-year-old in 1924 - just to commit a perfect trail. Leopold was a child prodigy who spoke his first words at four months, and was about to begin studies at Harvard Law; reportedly he had studied 15 languages and spoke at least five fluently recognition as an ornithologist. Leopold believed he was one whose superior intellect allowed him to rise above the laws and rules for the average, and convinced Loeb that he was also. Loeb had skipped several grades in school and had become the University of Michigan's youngest graduate at age 17.

Police found a pair of eyeglasses near the body - common in prescription and frame, they were also equipped with an unusual hinge that had been purchased by only three customers in Chicago - one being Leopold. Their alibi was exposed when Leopold's chauffeur told police that he was repairing Leopold's car the night of the murder - not available for joyriding.

661755,5,6303482201,"Compulsion is the fictionalized account of the crime of the century--the kidnapping and murder of a young boy by two bored and wealthy young geniuses--which led to the trial of the century in which one of the most famous attorneys ever argued for their lives. This is the film version of that book, which came out in 1959, the year after Nathan Leopold (aka Judd Steiner) was paroled and released from prison.

Having recently acquired an interest in Leopold and Loeb, and having read and reviewed the book Compulsion, it seemed only natural that I should watch and review the film with a critical eye toward seeing how well the book was translated onto the screen. I must say it was done very well.

We first meet Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and Artie Straus (Bradford Dillman) as they are gallivanting about in Judd's Stutz Bearcat and Artie tries to run down a drunken man who's walking down the road. This sets the tone, not only for the film, but for their relationship. Judd grabs the wheel and averts the potential murder, so Artie tells him to drive (keep in mind, it is Judd's car), and then orders him to run the bum down. Judd comes close, but at the last moment swerves, which angers Artie. To keep peace, Judd swears he'll do anything Artie wants. Anything. And although we don't know it yet, a murder is about to be born.

Martin Milner (later famed for his role in Adam 12, among other things) plays Sid Brooks (a fictional character, based on Meyer Levin), a fellow student at the university with Judd and Artie, and a fledgling reporter for the newspaper. Chance involves him in the case, and also his girl Ruth, who develops a relationship with Judd and later testifies at the trial.

This is a very faithful adaptation of the novel and captures the flavor of it very well. The cocksure attitude of the young geniuses who took the life of a young boy because they could, and to prove that such a thing could be done with great deliberation and no emotional involvement. We never see the victim, not even in the morgue, nor do we get a real sense of who he was. These things were not shown back then, too graphic. Today, I'm sure there would be a lot more gruesome scenes, but the film does not suffer for lack of them.

They came close to getting away with their crime, but a pair of eyeglasses was the crack in the facade that became the first clue, and that ultimately led to them. E.G. Marshall plays the prosecutor, Horn, who is determined to see these two boys hang for what they've done, despite their tender ages--18 and 19--and despite the fact that never has the state put to death anyone below the age of 21.

The boys' very wealthy parents hire the best attorney they can find--Jonathan Wilk (Clarence Darrow, in real life)--flawlessly played by Orson Welles. In a brilliant ploy, Wilk withdraws their plea of not guilty and changes it to guilty, with mitigating circumstances, thus eliminating the trial by jury. And despite the best efforts of the prosecutor, he does not plead insanity, as that would bring the jury back in. And as he explains to the boys' parents, he'd rather plead for their lives before one man, the judge, than twelve, in the form of the jury.

Welles' performance is riveting. Despite being very familiar with him as an actor, his persona disappears and he becomes Wilk/Darrow, and his very eloquent summation speech is some of his finest work. That is the hallmark of a great actor, when you stop seeing the man, and only see the character.

Although physically I thought the main characters were mis-cast, as Dean Stockwell resembled Artie more, and Bradford Dillman Judd, in terms of performance, they got the nuances of the characters down pat. Artie, the effervescent know-it-all who dominates Judd, and has to be in on everything, including ""helping"" the police with the case. The quieter, more introspective Judd, who allows Artie to control him.

What you won't see in the movie that isin the book, and what is barely hinted at in the film (and you really need to be looking for it to catch it) is the true nature of the relationship between Judd and Artie, namely that they were lovers. Any mention of what the book presents has been excised, probably due to the sensibilities of the times. I don't think it would have played well, and probably would have muddied the waters. Today? Another story altogether.

One comment on the opening music--although probably good for its time, now it sounded to me very 50ish and jarring, but perhaps that was the effect the composer was going for. It's jazzy and discordant, so maybe that's the right feel for two young men out of step with society.

Look for Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man) as Judd's bossy older brother Max. And a young Gavin MacLeod (Captain Steubing on the Love Boat) as Horn's assistant.

Also on the DVD were the theatrical trailer and a teaser and two trailers from other Fox films--St. Valentine's Day Massacre (Jason Robards Jr) and Murder Inc. (Stuart Whitman and Peter Falk).

One last comment on the film. As I said before, Judd was just beginning a relationship with Ruth Evans, who was Sid Brooks' girl, and I think that goes a long way to show his innate humanity, as opposed to Artie and his black book, his love 'em and leave 'em philosophy. There is a very intense scene between Judd and Ruth in the film.

On the whole, I was very pleased with the film, and highly recommend it.",1372464000,2,5427,4.6220145379023885
661756,4,6303482201,"The Jazz Age, the time, the decade or so, right after the war, World War I one if anybody is asking, was a weird time in America in some respects. That was the careless, crime-ridden ""war on alcohol"" age made famous by the like of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, especially the latter for his take on American upward mobility with his unforgettable character Jay Ganz trying to climb up the social anyway he could, no matter the body count, in The Great Gatsby. Of course that was fiction, fiction though that cut to the core, cut to the core like the film under review, Compulsion, was fiction although based on the infamous actions of Leopold and Loeb in Chicago in the 1920s.

Apparently our fictionalized lead characters here, Artie and Judd, two young men, boys really, from wealthy Chicago circumstances had spent too much of their spare time reading too many German philosophers, too much Nietzsche,  too seriously, especially those interested in creating a society led by ""supermen,"" the elite guided by no other criterion except pure rationality. No emotional attachments need apply.  And to prove that thesis, to try it out in practice, the pair crudely bludgeon some kid in park and depose of him in culvert after kidnapping him. They assume after such heroics that they have passed beyond the pale of mere mortals and have proven their superiority point. Except for the little problem of those damn glasses that Judd somehow left behind at the crime scene and that did them in posthaste. So from supermen they turned into, well, low- life cellmates in a trial for their lives.

While the drama here is driven for a while by trying to corral the pair, trying to dissect their weird motivations, the real claim to fame of this film should be as a rather powerful argument against the death penalty. Certainly the heinous crime they committed was in another age death-penalty worthy but as powerfully articulated by Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles), as their attorney, that barbaric form of punishment did nothing to deter the mad, the crazy and the socially isolated and offended against our evolving standard of civility. And so powerful was Mister Wilk's presentation that the judge actually gave both men life sentences. Life sentences to stew in their own juices over their views of the word and maybe change their perspectives around mere mortals.

661808,2,6303482201,"This is one of multiple films based on the Leopold and Loeb case. The film is basically done in halves. In the first half, Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman chew the scenery. Neither performance seemed very convincing. The problem of course is that given the times they can't really do it the way it would need to be done. The script also seems to tend toward making them more socially adjusted than they perhaps were. They are also being played older than perhaps they were.

The second half of the film is a set-piece where Orson Welles does essentially a long dramatic speech. Content apart, its impossible to deny the power of Welles as a speaker and actor. Its similiar to what he did in Moby Dick. But its disconnected from the rest of the film and as good as it is, it has a ""mailed in"" quality to it.

The trial itself is a farce. The judge plays it as if he is in the pocket of the defense. E.G. Marshall is a good actor, but he is not allowed to do anything. It would have been far more powerful to let him make an impassioned reply to the arguments Welles makes, but its not that kind of film. That Welles and his speech are so carefully protected weakens it considerably for me. They might well not have bothered giving anyone else lines during the courtroom scenes.

Additionally, the film somehow gives the impression that Darrow simply on a whim in court decided to change the plea to guilty without any consultation of his clients. That is just weird.

As with most things involving Darrow, the real case was a press farce. Two rich boys just happen to draw a judge whose pet cause is juvinile justice in a city which was not know in the first place for executions of the young and the predictable happend. Darrow's long political speech was more important in terms of press coverage for Darrow than it was to the case. The film also might have raised questions about Darrow's altruism and his reasoning for taking the case. Fees are one thing, but a national platform with daily press coverage is priceless.

The worst part of the film is the ending. Its not true to the real Darrow at all. Nor is the subsequent history of the two even mentioned. One is murdered in prison and the other is eventually released.

If you want to hear an impassioned speech against capital punishment, Welles does it about a good as it can be done. I think his argument was better and tighter than the original given by Darrow in court....at least from what I've read from extractions.

But there is a whole lot of uninteresting film to sit through to get to the speech.",1365379200,3,2570,4.45531914893617

Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman portray Judd Steiner and Arthur Strauss. I'd have to refer back to the documentary on Leopold-Loeb to work out which is which. Strauss is the dominant one, the one most nearly evil in the classic sense of the term. He's the one who wants to run down a drunk in the road just because he feels like it. Judd turns the wheel away, but also tells Strauss he will do anything Strauss tells him to, that he wants Strauss to lead and order him.

Some time is spent on the police work that went into discovering the identities of the killers, but it has the effect of showing that there is no effective defense on the facts, especially since both boys made confessions. OK, partly as accusing one another, but that matters little in such a crime.

Things look pretty much like an inevitable hanging when the boys' wealthy parents hire Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) to defend them.

661869,5,6303482201,"Magnificent thriller/police procedural/courtroom drama based on the infamous Leopold/Loeb murder case that took place in 1920's Chicago.  Two teenagers (Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell) kill a ten-year old boy to experience the thrill of it and to show their contempt for the rules of society.  In court they are represented by a famous lawyer (Orson Welles) who is known for taking on hopeless cases.  The lawyer chooses to focus, not on the guilt of the two (which is admitted) but rather on trying to keep them from receiving the death penalty.

The often erratic Welles gives one of the best performances of his career.  Especially effective is his long monologue at the end of the film in which he pleads for the judge to spare these obviously deranged boys.  Dillman is chilling as the leader of the pair of murderers.  The scene where he interrogates Stockwell while talking to a teddy bear is particularly effective.  Stockwell is the less interesting of the two, but he does a fine job as the weak, subservient accomplice to Dillman.  Most of the rest of the supporting cast, including E.G. Marshall and Martin Milner, is fine as well.  The one exception is Diane Varsi as the girl who comes to Stockwell's defense.  She is as stiff and wooden as a piece of lumber.  The trailer advertises her as ""Academy Award nominee for `Peyton Place'.""  One can only hope she did a much better job in that film.  Needless to say, she was not nominated for this one.

This must have been something of a controversial movie in its day.  Not only is Welles' monologue a scathing attack on capital punishment, widespread in the 1950's, but the homosexuality of the teenagers is all but stated bluntly.  The district attorney accuses Stockwell of never having a girlfriend, clearly indicating that Dillman was his boyfriend.  The master/slave relationship between him and Dillman is boldly stated in an early scene.  Pretty hot stuff for the 1950's!

That bit of miscasting aside, this is a taut, superb film.",1314403200,3,2005,4.8584070796460175
661870,4,6303482201,"""Compulsion"" (1959) was directed by Richard Fleischer (Soylent Green, Tora! Tora! Tora!, The Viking). This movie is based on the 1956 novel of the same name by Meyer Levin, which is based on the Leopold and Loeb trial. Artie Strauss (Bradford Dillman) and Judd Steiner(Dean Stockwell) kill a boy on his way home in order to commit the ""perfect murder"". Both were in their teens at the time and had very high IQs. The movie is a well crafted character driven film with good performances. I found it particularly interesting to watch a young Dean Stockwell, who would have been 23 at the time, after seeing him in more recent projects like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004) and as a recurring cast member in Battlestar Galactica (2006-2009).

Dean Stockwell's character, Juddsie or Judd, is excellently acted. The Artie character is as well.  The writing is wonderful.  The movie provides fascinating insight into characters who are well developed that portray amazing intellects, but, the tragedy is, they find no suitable acceptable outlet for their superior minds.  They disdain society, their families, and what they perceive to be intellectually inferior authorities - the police and the justice system.  After their mental sickness is extracted for display in the courtroom scenes, Judd recognizes his illness and seems desirous that he could have maybe overcome it to form a relationship with one girl who did connect with him, Ruthie.  These two, Artie and Judd, are pretty far gone and even after the court does show them mercy from the death penalty, they are incapable of gratitude.

661872,4,6303482201,"'Compulsion' is the brilliantly-performed film of a shocking event.  Two young men, after reading Nietsche and speculating on their own world-shaking intellects, decide to commit the perfect murder--a thrill kill.  They kidnap a young boy, murder him, dispose of the corpse, then toy with the police to lead them in the wrong direction and indulge their egos.

Of course, it all goes wrong...otherwise there would have never been a trial, books and movies.  The killers are tied in the cord of their own 'brilliance.'

This film, in fact, is two films rolled into one.  The first, and to my way of thinking the most interesting, film is the first...the story of the crime and the two murderers.  The second film starts abruptly on the arrest of the killers.  Orson Wells enters the movie as the ponderous, anti-capital punishment, defense attorney [Clarence Darrow in real life].  After first pleading 'Not Guilty', then observing the faces of the jurers, he abruptly changes the verdict to 'Guilty, with Mitigating Circumstances.'  This means that the jury must be removed and the case tried by only the judge.

On the other hand, should Darrow aruge an 'Insanity' Defense, a jury must again be empanelled.  Nevertheless, Darrow brings 'experts' to the stand who testify that the killers are mentally deranged and one killer is diagnosed as 'schizophrenic'.  Somehow the judge lets all these shenanigans stand [remember Judge Ito?] so, despite the bias of the movie/directors/producers/writers, we know the bias of the judge.  He WILL return life imprisonment verdicts i.e. no capital punishment.  Nevertheless, Darrow goes on to passionately argue the immorality of capital punishment...and...might I say, his speeches are impressive.

Still I downgraded this otherwise excellent movie from 5 to 4 stars because this is a film with a heavy-handed message, which is just another word for bias, prejudice and propaganda.  In that I am thoroughly sick of high school-dropout film makers preaching to the rest of the rest of us, I downgraded this one star and maybe should have downgraded it more.

So what is the 'message' and propaganda?  It's the same as Capote's 'In Cold Blood'.  No matter how heinous a crime, the death verdict is NEVER justified.  Why?  Because, ultimately, no one is really, REALLY, responsible for his/her actions.  The fault is that of mothers, fathers, society and/or environment.  Afterall, anyone who does anything awful can't be sane....can he?  If he's not sane, how can we execute him?

But I would turn this argument inside out.  If we...in an ultimate sense...are not responsible, how can we put ANYONE in prison?  Truly, it's not really a question of the death penalty, it's a matter of punishment.  If we aren't responsible, how is it possible that we can be punished?  Isn't it immoral?  Personally, I don't know, but do know this:  A society...any society...that acts as if the individual bears no responsibility, is finished.

661873,4,6303482201,"The Bottom Line:

A well-made film that follows the facts of the ""trial of the century"" Leopold and Loeb case fairly closely (while admittedly leaving out some of the more salacious details) and features several splendid performances, Compulsion is better in its first half than its long-winded courtroom drama conclusion, but it's still an interesting film that should appeal to people familiar with the case and neophytes alike.

661875,3,6303482201,"Loosely based off the truly heinous crime committed by the Loeb and Leopold boys, `Compulsion' is at times chilling and very effective; but still, there are moments (and even long stretches) where that affect wears off and leaves us with a half-hearted attempt at thrilling.

The film opens rather over-the-top and somewhat irritatingly as it introduces us to Judd Steiner and Arthur Straus.  Straus is the obvious ringleader, bossy and controlling, while Judd almost cowers to his every whim in hopes of approval.  Once the title of the film flashes across the screen these two actors (Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman) ease into their characters and actually pull out two very entertaining and realistic portrayals of sick young men vying for attention in all the wrong places.  When their determination to `experience everything' gets the best of them and they go too far (murdering a young boy) they find themselves working up a convoluted story in order to free themselves from speculation, but as their story unravels they are left at the mercy of a jury and the District Attorney.

Insert Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilk, the boys' lawyer.

The film is essentially two halves of one whole.  The first half is all about Steiner and Straus and their crime, while the second half is primarily about the abolishment of the death penalty.  Welles closing arguments in particular are an outstanding example in persuasion as he attacks the concept of calculated murder in any instance; even court ordered.  My problem is that the lack of focus leaves the films resulted moral rather unfinished.  It just doesn't mesh as well as it could have.  When you look at films like `Dead Man Walking', that tackled the same line of logic but with much greater results (due to a more eloquent and woven structure), you can see where this film missed the mark in areas.

The acting across the board is very good, especially from Stockwell and Dillman, who as I said really sunk into their characters.  That opening scene (""Hit him!"") was far too over-the-top, but once it was over the actors found their stride and stuck with it.  Much has been said about Orson, and I personally consider him one of the greatest actors of all time, and one of the greatest influences on cinema, but his performance here was a little stale for me.  In fact, the stand out supporting performance in my opinion comes from E.G. Marshall, who nailed the tough position of District Attorney Harold Horn.  Just look at his facial expressions as Welles is delivering his final speech.  Watch every word sink in.

Genius.

In parts this is a very well done film, and those parts make this more than worth checking out at least once.  Whether or not you decide it is worth revisiting is completely up to your perception of the film.  I like what it has to say, I just don't think it is as effective as it could have been in saying it.  Some very good acting saves it from falling completely off the map for me; but as far as legal thrillers are concerned, this same year sports `Anatomy of a Murder', which is a much better film all around.",1239840000,6,3103,4.717996289424861

Why should the cops link the glasses to him? It all inevitably leads to trial where an expert lawyer (Orson Welles) comes to their defense.

661938,5,6303482201,"The brilliant Orson Welles' eloquent and compassionate soliloquy as defense attorney Jonathan Wilk during summation at the trial of two adolescent boys accused of murder is the highlight of the movie ""Compulsion"".

This crime and courtroon drama is based on the 1924 trial of Loeb and Leopold, two wealthy and intelligent teenaged law students who killed a young boy in a ""thrill"" killing.  Bradford Dillman playing Artie Straus and Dean Stockwell playing Judd Steiner felt so smug and intellectually gifted that they believed they could commit and get away with the perfect crime.  Dillman the cocky leader of the two goaded the shy and introverted Stockwell into carrying out the demented plot.  Both boys had no real close friends and subsisted together in what had the looks of a homosexual relationship.

Straus and Steiner conjured up alibis for the time of the murder but were split up for interrogation by state attorney Harold Horn, with E.G Marshall excellently playing a typical role for him.  Marshall was able to trip the boys up and soon they were standing trial and facing the death penalty.

The boys wealthy parents hired Jonathan Wilkes, played by a jowly Orson Welles who was supposed to represent the legendary Clarence Darrow to defend the boys.  The superbly oratorical Welles shined brightly with his dialogue and stage presence.  By withdrawing a plea of not guilty he removed the jury from the decision making process.  The guilty plea with mitigating circumstances allowed psychological profiling to be admitted as testimony.  He was able to appeal to the judge whose job was to pronounce sentencing to overturn the death penalty and settle for a verdict of life imprisonment.

Director Richard Fleischer did a creditable job in presenting what was a landmark case In American jurisprudence.",1118275200,29,1817,5.122033898305085
661939,3,6303482201,"Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb were two intellectually gifted, extremely wealthy young men of 1920s Chicago--but they were also highly neurotic.  In 1924 their twisted relationship exploded into one of the most infamous crimes of the era: largely in order to demonstrate their supposed intellectual superiority, they kidnapped and murdered fourteen year old Bobby Franks.  But their ""perfect crime"" was not quite as perfect as they had thought: it quickly unraveled, and with the celebrated Clarence Darrow appearing for the defense the court case became as legendary as the crime.

The 1959 film COMPULSION, based on the Leopold-Loeb case, had a great deal going for it.  The cast was superior and included a Hollywood legend; director Richard Fleischer was a rock-solid craftsman; production values from cinematography to composer to costumer were in experienced and capable hands.  But the film ran afoul of two issues: censorship codes of the day, which effectively prevented a no-holds-barred re-telling of the case, and the fact that Nathan Leopold was still very much alive.

The result was a script that transformed Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb into characters named 'Judd Steiner' and 'Artie Straus' and which renamed Clarence Darrow 'Jonathan Wilk'--and which can only imply in vaguest possible terms aspects of the case that most find particularly fascinating.  With so much detail thrown out, the result is a film that divides into two rather awkwardly joined parts.

The first half of the film focuses on Steiner and Straus.  The cast is indeed exceptional, with Dean Stockwell and Bradford Dillman extremely effective and receiving memorable support from the likes of Diane Varsi and Martin Milner.  Still, it is more a matter of implication rather than specification, and even the crime itself is somewhat glossed over.  The second half of the film brings in Orson Wells as attorney Wilk and unexpectedly shifts focus away from the killers and their crime, leaving Wells to dominate the screen with a series of powerful speeches. The ending of the film is remarkably abrupt and fails to tie the film together.

When all is said and done, COMPULSION never quite manages to live up to its potential.  The memorable performances and stylish look of the film make it more than worth seeing, but any one who is familar with the Leopold-Loeb case will be disappointed--and even those who aren't will likely consider that one viewing is enough.  At present the film is only available to the homemarket on video in a pan-and-scan version that doesn't help it along.  Recommended--but only just.

661940,5,6303482201,"""Compulsion"" is a fine film, not least of all because of its theme music.  Something that has always bothered me is that the real Leopold and Loeb were 16 years old when they committed the crime, yet Dillman and Stockwell are obviously much older.  This is important because the judge rules for life in prison instead of death mainly because of their ages.  This is nitpicking, because they would have been hard-pressed to find 16-year-old actors, even though today's ultra-realistic films might have done so.

Wisely filmed in black and white, the film is quintessential 60's.  The homosexuality is only vaguely hinted at; this is proper as such things were not talked about at the time and wes not in any case essential to the film.  The boys' wealth and intelligence were, and Darrow knew that, with all their advantages, they were emotionally delayed. Welles's speech contains many passages from Darrow's original oration/plea.

The acting is first-rate, especially Dean Stockwell's performance.  E.G. Marshall gets a confession out of the two boys before they even get a chance to speak to an attorney (in these pre-Miranda days) which gives you food for thought ... would the boys have confessed if Darrow was present from the start (NO!)?

7848386,5,6303482201,"Compulsion is based on the 1924 Leopold and Loeb murder case. Two extremely intelligent, wealthy Chicago law students, Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and Arthur A. Straus (Bradford Dillman), feel it would be an interesting experiment to plan and execute the perfect murder of an innocent young boy. The murder is not shown, but it is described in detail. Defense attorney Jonathan Wilk (based on Clarence Darrow and played by Orson Welles), is hired by the boys families to defend them. Though the names have been changed, the films details are essentially factual and focus on the two defendants  one arrogant and intimidating, the other sensitive and introverted  who thought their superior intellect would enable them to pull off the perfect crime. The murder was referred to as the crime of the century.

Compulsion is compelling as a character study of two narcissists who feel they are above the law and hatch a lethal scheme to prove they can actually get away with committing murder. The dynamic between the two drives the film. They both bear a superior detachment from society, a superiority based on Nietzsches concepts of the superman. Theres also a strong suggestion of homosexuality which, in itself, was pretty daring for a 1959 film. They are simultaneously reprehensible and fascinating.

Director Richard Fletcher has crafted an intriguing adaptation of the Meyer Levin novel. Performances are uniformly first-rate, with Dillman and Welles especially effective. Dillmans Straus is clearly the brains of the plot with submissive Steiner going along for the thrill ride. Straus is the ultimate sociopath, a quality masked by affluence and arrogance. Welles Wilk has a lengthy speech during the trial, based on actual court transcripts, in which his character makes a plea for humanitarianism, hoping to spare Steiner and Straus from a death sentence. Darrow delivered a 12-hour summation. In the film, Wilks speech is ten minutes. The same case was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcocks Rope (1948).

Andrews Blu-ray Review: COMPULSION [1959] is one of several stage or screen productions based on the Leopold and Loeb trial. Other trial-inspired productions include Alfred Hitchcock's The Rope [1948], Tom Kalin's impressionistic black-and-white film Swoon [1992], and John Logan's play Never the Sinner [1997].

COMPULSION was the title of a fictionalized account of the Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. and Richard Albert Loeb trial, written in 1956 by Meyer Levin. The story concerns two wealthy Chicago teenagers, Artie Strause [Bradford Dillman] and Judd Steiner [Dean Stockwell], who kidnap and murder a young boy, become suspects because of glasses found with the boy's body, confess, and are defended by the brilliant lawyer, Jonathan Wilk [Orson Welles].

COMPULSION contains many other parallels to the real Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. and Richard Albert Loeb story, including Judd Steiner's (Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr.) obsession with the philosophy of Nietzsche, the theft by the boys of a typewriter used to type the ransom note, the inadvertent destruction of the boys' alibi by the Judd Steiner's family chauffeur, and the use of verbatim passages from Darrow's trial summation.

We first meet Judd Steiner [Dean Stockwell] and Artie Straus [Bradford Dillman] as they are gallivanting about in Judd Steiners Stutz Bearcat car and Artie Straus tries to run down a drunken man whos walking down the road. This sets the tone, not only for the film, but for their relationship. Judd grabs the wheel and averts the potential murder, so Artie Straus tells him to drive and keep in mind, it is Judd Steiners car, and then orders him to run the bum down. Judd Steiner comes close, but at the last moment swerves, which angers Artie Straus. To keep peace, Judd Steiner swears hell do anything Artie Straus wants and we mean anything. And although we don't know it yet, a murder is about to be born.

Martin Milner plays Sid Brooks, a fictional character, based on Meyer Levin, a fellow student at the university with Judd and Artie, and a fledgling reporter for the newspaper. Chance involves him in the case, and also his girl Ruth, who develops a relationship with Judd and later testifies at the trial.

This is a very faithful adaptation of the novel and captures the flavour of it very well. The cocksure attitude of the young geniuses, who took the life of a young boy because they could, and to prove that such a thing could be done with great deliberation and no emotional involvement. We never see the victim, not even in the morgue, nor do we get a real sense of who he was. These things were not shown back then, too graphic. Today, Im sure there would be a lot more gruesome scenes, but the film does not suffer for lack of them.

They came very close to getting away with their crime, but a pair of eyeglasses was the crack in the facade that became the first clue, and that ultimately led to them. E.G. Marshall plays the prosecutor, Horn, who is determined to see these two boys hang for what theyve done, despite their tender ages 18 and 19 years of age and despite the fact that never has the state put to death anyone below the age of 21.

The boys very wealthy parents hire the best attorney they can find in Jonathan Wilk (Clarence Darrow, in real life) and flawlessly played by Orson Welles. In a brilliant ploy, Jonathan Wilk withdraws their plea of not guilty and changes it to guilty, with mitigating circumstances, thus eliminating the trial by jury. And despite the best efforts of the prosecutor, he does not plead insanity, as that would bring the jury back in. And as he explains to the boys parents, hed rather plead for their lives before one man, the judge, than twelve, in the form of the jury. Orson Welles performance is riveting. Despite being very familiar with him as an actor, his persona disappears and he becomes Jonathan Wilk/Clarence Darrow, and his very eloquent summation speech is some of his finest work. That is the hallmark of a great actor, when you stop seeing the man, and only see the character.

One comment on the opening composed music, although probably good for its time, now it sounded to me very 1950s and jarring, but perhaps that was the effect the composer was going for. Its jazzy and discordant, so maybe thats the right feel for two young men out of step with society. Look for Richard Anderson [Six Million Dollar Man] as Judds bossy older brother Max. And a young Gavin MacLeod (Captain Steubing on the Love Boat) as Horns assistant.

One last comment on the film. As I said before, Judd was just beginning a relationship with Ruth Evans, who was Sid Brooks girl, and I think that goes a long way to show his innate humanity, as opposed to Artie Straus and his black book, his love em and leave em philosophy. There is a very intense scene between Judd Steiner and Ruth Evans in the film. On the whole, I was very pleased with the film, and highly recommend it.

Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. said that reading COMPULSION made him ""physically sick,"" caused him to feel ""terrific shame,"" and induced a ""mild melancholia."" He felt as ""if he were exposed stark-naked under the strong spotlight before a large audience."" He also complained that the book depicted the murder in sexual terms. Steiner saw the murder as a way to kill the girl within himself; Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. dismissed such a motive in his own case as preposterous. In 1959, Nathan Freudenthal Leopold, Jr. filed suit against the producers of the film COMPULSION.

Trivia: Because Orson Welles was having tax problems during the production, at the end of shooting his salary for the movie was garnisheed by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. This upset Orson Welles so much that just before he finished looping his dialogue in post-production, he stormed off the studio and left the country. All that was left to be looped was the last 20 seconds of his end speech in the courtroom. Incredibly, Editor William Reynolds fixed this problem without needing Orson Welles. William Reynolds took words and pieces of words Orson Welles had spoken earlier in the film, and pieced them one by one into those 20 seconds.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Signal One Entertainment brings us this classic film COMPULSION that has been digitally restored and remastered in 4K and offered up on Blu-ray in an encoded 1080p image that looks quite remarkable given the age of this 1959 film. The Black-and-White photography looks absolutely striking, with strong contrast and only the slightest hint of crush in some of the blacks. The restorative efforts have delivered elements that are largely free of any major cases of damage. Moments of softness come and go, and typical of the time and close-ups flaunt a diffused gauzy quality, but considering what the restorers had to work with, this is quite an admirable effort that rightfully honours this film noir winning film. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Special Feature: Richard Fleischer Guardian Interview [Audio only] [1981] [1080p] [2.35:1] [93:18] The Guardian Interview with award-winning director Richard Fleischer, is in conversation with Adrian Turner at the National Film Theatre in London on the 1st February, 1981. This recording exhibits a range of problems which are to be expected given the age and the nature of its production. In addition to those affecting the recording of the questions from the audience are often very difficult to hear. Signal One Entertainment hopes that these issues will not detract from your enjoyment of this historical important recording document. While the film COMPULSION is being presented to you again, we are informed by Adrian Turner that Richard Fleischer is in London because of his film The Jazz Singer had just opened in the cinema, and has kindly accepted an invitation to the National Film Theatre to do a question and answer session. We find out that Richard Fleischer has directed over 40 different films, which includes Fantastic Voyage [1966]; Doctor Doolittle [1967]; The Boston Strangler [1968] and Che! [1969]. We find out there is no mystery in his choice of films to direct, it is a fact that he will direct a film when someone offers him a job, but eventually it all boils down to Richard himself feeling the film is worth directing and one that audiences will want to go and see at the cinema, as well as hopefully is a commercial success, but most importantly Richard wants a script that is intelligently well written. Richard Fleischer praises the actor Orson Welles, but when it came to dean Stockwell, who says is a totally different actor who prefers the method style of acting, and of course Richard would approach each actor is a different way, but most importantly you must be a good listener and console each actor is all its foibles. We hear that when Orson Welles does his court appearance scene, Richard had only 10 days shooting time with this actor and had to get it right as on the 10th day Orson Welles was off to China and would not be delayed, so Richard used three cameras to get it all on film. We find out that Richard has done several films with the theme on murder and enjoys directing these types of genre, as he wants to get under the skin of the perpetrator and try and find out why perform these heinous crimes. But Richard is also a great advocate against Capital Punishment and most of those types of films to do with murder, the end result Richard want to achieve is that they are sent to prison and praises the British justice system of capital punishment being outlawed and that is why he wanted to direct the film 10 Rillington Place [1971] in the United Kingdom and of course with the brilliant actor Sir Richard Attenborough as John Christie. We of course find out that his Father was the famous cartoonist Max Fleischer, who was based in New York, who had great rivalry with Walt Disney, well once day Walt Disney phoned Richard Fleischer to come the Walt Disney Studio and offered him the job to direct the film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea [1954] and of course Richard was totally flattered, but insisted to Walt Disney that he must contact his Father so as to give him his blessing, which he did so very enthusiastically and of course gave him his blessing. But of course Richard asked Walt Disney why he was asked to direct that film, well Walt Disney was so impressed with several of his films and that is why he thought Richard would be ideal to direct 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and of course they breathed a sigh of relief as the film was a big box office hit, but at the time of the film being directed the Walt Disney Studio was in very serious debt problems. Adrian Turner comments on some of Richard Fleischers films are very violent, and especially by the critics, but Richard informs us that he does not go out to make a film for children and we are all adults and he also informs us whenever we turn on the Radio or TV for the news, there is much more violence happening in the world at one time and Richard would never go out of his way to direct an over the top violent film, because it is not necessary. Richard talks about directing the film The Vikings [1958] where Kirk Douglas was the Producer and Richard informs us that it was the most unpleasant experience in all his career working with Kirk Douglas and nearly pulled out of directing the film, as Kirk Douglas was acting like a spoilt Diva and because of this very bad experience, never ever wanted to work with Kirk Douglas again, because Kirk Douglas was always having constantly differences of opinions with Richard on how the film The Vikings should be filmed. Of course as we go through this very interesting interview, we get quite a few very interesting questions from the audience and the answers that Richard responds is totally fascinating and on top of that Richard Fleischer is a totally fascinating and interesting intelligent person and also has some more interesting opinions about the state of the film industry in general and especially the preservation of old classic films, especially the ones in colour, so that they can be viewed by future generations to come. But all in all, to not listen to this particular audio only presentation with Richard Fleischer will be a crime, as it has been the most joyous 1 hour and 33 minutes audio experience and definitely gets a five star rating from me.

Special Feature: Richard Fleischer Guardian Interview] [1994] [480i] [1.33:1] [76:42] The Guardian Interview with award-winning director Richard Fleischer, returns to the National Film Theatre in London on the 19th April, 1994. This video recording exhibits a range of problems which are to be expected given the age and the nature of its production. In addition to those affecting the recording of the questions from the audience are often very difficult to hear. Signal One Entertainment hopes that these issues will not detract from your enjoyment of this historical important recording document. But what is so nice with this particular interview is that we actually get to see this famous director Richard Fleischer in person, and once again doing some more question and answer session with the audience. At the start of this interview, we hear from Richard about his first meeting with Orson Welles before shooting started on the film COMPULSION and found out what a pain in the neck Orson Welles was and comments on how gross and overweight Orson Welles was and looked like a clown, without the circus costume. Well once again we hear about the 10 day shoot schedule he was only being allowed with Orson Welles, and on the 10th days shoot, Richard found out that there was too much noise from the three cameras on the recording, and wanted Orson Welles to go in the recording studio to do the post sync sound, but Orson Welles refused and walked out and got on a boat to China. So Richard thought this was a total disaster and an end to the film he had just directed, so his brilliant and very professional Editor went through all the recording of Orson Welles and found each individual words spoken by Orson Welles and edited it all together, to produce a flawless recording to replace the bad recording with the court scene, and Richard could not praise this very professional editor, but felt really vindicated, because he got one over Orson Welles. Before Richard got into proper filmmaking, especially with RKO, he was asked to make some short Flicker Flashbacks films, and goes into great detail about what they filmed and what the contents of the films contained and was under contract with Path News, where Richard did some directing, as well as do the screenplay and also did some commentary as well. Richard talks in depth about his involvement with the Un American Activity situation and how he nearly lost his job at RKO, but as you will hear that eventually it all got resolved and that nasty evil event in the American history finally faded away and Richard felt it shold never have happened, especially in a so called civilised society. Richard also tells us the story again with his meeting with Walt Disney in making the film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea [1954] and having to deal with the belligerent attitude of the actor Kirk Douglas, which Richard had now wish he had never had to work with this Diva actor, who was always taking his shirt off. Despite the negative atmosphere while making the film, but luckily they were very rare events and the interviewer asks Richard what type of genre film does he like to direct, as there has been so many different kinds of films he has directed, well again he very much likes crime and psychological films and talks about the film 10 Rillington Place [1971] and working with the brilliant Sir Richard Attenborough, which he informs us was the most enjoyable experience in his directing career. Of course once again we get quite a few question and answer session from the audience and again was totally fascinating hearing his very intelligent answers, and once again Richard Fleischer is a totally fascinating and intelligent person, who I could listen to all night long and of course to sum up this was once again a totally brilliant special feature and is well worth viewing and again gets a five star rating from me.

Special Feature: Orson Welles in the Courtroom Scene from COMPULSION [Audio only] [1959] [1080p] [1.33:1] [10:10] Here is the dramatic courtroom scene from the film COMPULSION, where Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilk, appeals to the court to spare the two accused teenage murders. The portrayal by Mr. Orson Welles is one of the screens greatest moments. The words are those of one of historys greatest criminal lawyers, Clarence Darrow. This recording was released by the Top Rank Records Limited  London on an Extended Play 45rpm vinyl record.

Special Feature: Lobby Cards, Posters and Stills Gallery [2016] [1080p] [00:59] Here you get to view 59 stunning Black-and-White and Colour images from around the world and to view each individual images you have to press the NEXT button on your remote control to advance the images you want to view.

Theatrical Trailer [1959] [480i] [0.78:0] [2:27] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film COMPULSION. Sadly the quality is atrocious and not up to the standard of the 1080p image of the film, but despite this it is a brilliant presentation.

PLUS: Here we have a brilliantly designed reversible Blu-ray cover by artist Graham Humphreys. Graham Humphreys is an illustrator and graphic designer based in London, United Kingdom.

Finally, when COMPULSION premiered at the 1959 Vannes Film Festival, it became one of those rare occasions where the best actor award was shared between Bradford Dillman, Dean Stockwell and Orson Welles won the Best Actor Award. Unfortunately the film was not a huge success, which is a shame as it is far superior to the Alfred Hitchcock film THE ROPE, and sadly COMPULSION faded away into obscurity, where it still remains to some extent, however this new British Blu-ray Release from Signal One Entertainment it has now been given a new lease of life and also for a new audience to appreciate this film noir classic from director Richard Fleischer and the sterling performances from the brilliant actors Bradford Dillman, Dean Stockwell and Orson Welles. Highly Recommended!
