2518816,4,B000EHN1NW,"Contrary to a previous reviewer (Ray ""History Buff""), Schaeffer never ""took back"" his evangelical views.  ""Crazy For God"" was the work of Franky Schaeffer, Francis' son who converted from evangelical Presbyterianism to the Catholic faith.  That book is condemned by pretty much everyone who really knew Francis as a hit-piece against his father.

But back to the sermon in this video. Hearing (or reading the transcript) today, we can see how right Schaeffer was - with his practically prophetic illustrations.  He illustrates in this speech the reality of why our nation has fallen so far.  And with the perspective of 27 years of recent history since this address, we can see that all he warned about is fully present in society.",1255910400,14,731,5.008264462809917
2518817,1,B000EHN1NW,"This is from 1982 folks. It is 2009 and America is still here and will remain here. Francis Schaeffer's newest book called ""Crazy for God"" admits that the christian right has mis-guided America and he claims that he and his father are partly responsible for the nomiminations of Bush Sr and Jr. and that they have been utter and blatent wrong choices for presidency.
The Crazy for God book is very powerful and Francis finally admits that the evangelical scene is nothing but cults of personality and many are riding that Jesus-cash cow all the way to the bank.
So any works by this man before his last is all rubbish and fear-induced, paranoia designed to cause christians to further divide this country as they have done in the last decade ever so sharply.
Francis just does not tell the truth in his former books even though it may seem like it is all good. He admitted it himself, just read Crazy for God.",1247529600,,909,4.548780487804878
2518818,5,B000EHN1NW,"This is a sermon delivered at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in 1982 by the seventy-year-old evangelist, apologist, theologian, preacher, teacher, author and activist, Francis A. Schaeffer. It was two years before his death from cancer in 1984. He was not a flashy speaker, but trades rather on reason, passion, and knowledge.

The message basically covers the material from his book, ""A Christian Manifesto"" (Crossway, 1981). Schaeffer argues that the secular humanist worldview is responsible for the loss of human value and religious freedoms in the United States. He claims that the Christian worldview will bring forth a different and better culture than a worldview that takes the ultimate reality to be impersonal matter. Schaeffer calls Christians to know their history and to know their Lord as the Master of all life, to use their political freedoms to counter the humanistic consensus in law and culture.

This is solid and stirring stuff. There was no bluff, no glibness, and no trivia in this brave and wise man. He saw the big picture, but did not revel in superficialities. His words are measured, but delivered with fire and light. May his tribe multiply in our day--twenty six years after he delivered this message, a day when abortion on demand is still the law of the land, when infants who survive abortions are left to die, when the infirm are left to die or actively killed (as with Terry Schiavo in 2005), a day when too many Christians are stupefied by conformist and apathetic ways of life that fail to honor Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

As Schaeffer once wrote, ""Oh, triune God. Shake the world again.""",1207872000,27,1634,4.934545454545455

8109767,5,B000EHN1NW,"It's hard to believe this message was delivered over thirty years ago.  It might have been delivered yesterday.  Francis Schaeffer warned us where our society was headed, and many of his predictions have come true.  I don't think he ever claimed to be a prophet, but in light of today's culture, this message sounds almost prophetic.",1414800000,2,333,4.910714285714286
