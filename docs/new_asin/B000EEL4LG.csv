8108794,5,B000EEL4LG,"My concern about this movie is why it is not on a DVD already.  The price for the new copy of VHS is laughable.

8108796,5,B000EEL4LG,I saw the ad on TV before this movie aired and thought it might be worth while to watch.  I was very pleased with this movie.  The writing is very good (nice dialog) and the cast are first rate performers.  This is a very fun family movie (if you can get your hands on it!)  Pop some popcorn and sit back and relax.  My only serious complain is that it is virtually impossible to find a copy of this movie.  I found a VHS copy somehow (now I see that you can only buy used copies and they are pricey!),1195084800,3,501,3.96
