8472970,5,B000ICLS8I,"The price of this DVD is lower than one of my private lessons, so I decided to buy it. I have taken private salsa lessons for two years and my instructor also taught me cha cha, merengue and bachata.  Cha Cha is my favorite dance of these four latin dances, but the clubs don't play enough cha cha music for me to practice--so I felt a cha cha video would be helpful.
This DVD has good instruction on styling, footwork, timing and also patterns that aren't too difficult--but good intermediate patterns.  I learned some new patterns and some new things about styling. The instructors are excellent dancers--the woman has a lot of energy and good styling.
This DVD is only 90 minutes long instead of the 2 hours listed on the cover.
This DVD was worth it for me--if you consider a private lesson costs $60 per hour.  There is enough material on this DVD for 5 or 6 lessons.",1297036800,,872,4.4375
8472971,1,B000ICLS8I,"This is about the stupidest video I have ever viewed. They spend more time introducing the segments, which are extremely short, than they do any actual teaching. Additionally, I want a dance video, not a video on personal hygeine, breath mints, and stating the obvious, such as ""please actually move when you dance, ha ha ha, and don't just stand there and move your feet back and forth, ha ha ha"". If I hadn't opened this video, I would send it back and get my money back.  Extremely disappointed.",1260230400,,498,4.595505617977528
8472972,1,B000ICLS8I,"This was one of the worst videos I have ever bought.  Most of the video expressed their thoughts on dance etiquette and misc information.  i.e.  they advised you to take a shower before one dances with their partner.  If you want someone to teach you dance steps, this is not the video for you.",1249862400,,294,4.388888888888889
8472973,5,B000ICLS8I,"Great instructions, good tips and just all around a great purchase.  If you are serious about the Salsa or just want to be able to get on the floor and move,  this is the DVD for you.  My husband and I love it, I'm  so glad I bought it.",1244505600,6,236,3.7551020408163267
8472974,5,B000ICLS8I,"A friend of mine recommended the Salsa Dance Bootcamp. I couldn't resist. I got it and jumped right in. It was great. I'm glad that she recommended it to me. Salsa Crazy has a lot of videos, and I've been trying them all out. So far, so good.",1211241600,3,242,4.0625
8472975,5,B000ICLS8I,I have a couple of the salsacrazy dvds.  This company has really mastered the art of clearly instructing dances and making it seem so easy to learn.  I took a lot of group classes that I struggled with.  So these dvd's have been so helpful.  Thanks so much salsacrazy!!,1210550400,7,269,4.428571428571429
