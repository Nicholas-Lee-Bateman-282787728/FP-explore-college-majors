4994359,5,B006JN8770,"To start off, I grew up watching the original Transformers. I have watched all the shows that came after. Robots in Disguise, Beast Wars, Beast Machines, Armada...I've seen them all. Through the good and bad. So one can say Transformers has a special place in my heart. Transformers:Prime is absolutley mind blowing. The story lines are amazing, character designs are spectacular,  the music score is simply beautiful, and the voice talent is second to none. Peter Cullen returns as Optimus Prime with Frank Welker also returning as Megatron including a special guest appearance from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson.

I don't believe in spoilers therefore you will get none from me. Transformers:Prime makes a for a great investment for children and adults alike.  You will not be disappointed.",1326672000,21,788,5.188976377952756
4994360,5,B006JN8770,"Transformers Prime is one of the best! I have been a transformer fan since the beginning in the 1980's and this takes me back to that time with how great of a series this is. This series is as good as any from the G1 days with amazing action and solid storylines from the first episode to the final episode. One thing I will agree with from another review is that I would have rather seen Ironhide in the series instead of Bulkhead,but maybe they will bring him into the action in season 2. Also I would have liked to see Bumblebee actually talk again,but this is a minor detail compared to how awesome an all around series Transformers Prime is. This series is a vast improvement over the earlier animated series with better looking transformers,characters,and quality overall. The main character transformers are amazing looking whether in robot or vehicle modes. Optimus has a G1 touch along with a new millenium look all wrapped up into one for a cool appearence all around. Megatron is menacing as ever with one of the best looks he has ever had that blows his G1 appearence away. Starscream has a new,more sleek appearence that is very cool as well. Ratchet has one of his best character appearence's ever with his classic G1 colors and usual staight forward personality. Bumblebee is as cool as ever with a sweet looking sports car mode that blows the earlier animated version off the charts. My favorite would be Arcee,which looks the best she ever has in any transformer series. Arcee has great storylines involving her nemesis Blackarachnia. Arcee faces personal demons and has some heart felt momments along the way while kicking some major ass all around. The human characters of Raf,Miko,and Jack compliment the series very well while intrigating into the storylines just as well along with their autobot counterparts. If you are a fan of transformers this is a great series for all ages whether you are just getting into transformers or have loved them since your childhood. Bottom line Transformers Prime is a 10 out of 10 DVD series that is a thrill ride with compelling storylines that will keep you in anticipation from episode to episode. I highly recommend Transformers Prime Season 1 to all transformer fans out there. Transformers Rule!!!",1326240000,36,2260,4.827319587628866
4994361,5,B006JN8770,"(This was written before the actual item was released; this review is about the show, not the discs.)

I watched Beast Wars and Beast Machines when I was young, but, after the Bayformers movies came out, I was really ready to give up on Transformers as a whole.  :(  Then, while staying at a friend's house (watching her 70"" HDTV with a much better selection of satellite channels than I had at home...), I saw a commercial for episode 14, ""Out of His Head.""  I was hooked on the animation.  I set my phone alarm to go off so I wouldn't miss it and dropped everything when the alarm went off.  Then I stayed up late to watch another episode come on later.  Then I went on YouTube and watched every episode they had posted (which somehow was skewed since I missed episodes at least three episodes, as I found, thanks to episode-numbering problems).

I can't wait to have all the episodes in Blu-Ray quality at my fingertips!!  It will be great to see it all in sequence.  Instant buy.",1325548800,5,983,4.411111111111111
4994362,5,B006JN8770,"Of all the series to come after G1, this one actually is good. The only thing I wish they would have done different was had Ironhide in this instead of Bulkhead. I hope they add more characters in season two (more regular transformer characters that is). The nods to G1 have been nice, and my son really likes this show. I had it recorded for him on our DVR, and that's all he ever wanted to watch. I got him Darkness Rising and the Complete G1 Series for Christmas, and that's what he asks to watch. Its nice to him enjoying the same cartoon I did as a kid. He has a hard time deciding which he likes better, the G1 or Transformer Prime. He was able to relate to TP better than other series since Peter Cullen is voice acting as Optimus Prime again. As soon as he heard his voice, he said ""dad, its Optimus Prime, but in a new form.""",1324944000,2,834,4.122699386503068
4994363,5,B006JN8770,"My first introduction to the Transformers phenomenon was with the Bayverse films - not exactly the best place to start. However, the characters intrigued me, and I explored the subject further.

I liked the look of Tf: Prime, but didn't expect to be able to see it. But it started showing on Cartoon Network over here in the UK in August 2011 - I was hooked from the start. Then CN stopped at episode 13, and just repeated the first 13 episodes over and over again. (Can you imagine how absolutely infuriating that is?) As it happened I was able to watch the rest of the series on Youtube before Hasbro stepped in and demanded they be removed (a stupid action as far as I'm concerned: there was no other way I'd have been able to see them. I'm buying the DVDs on the strength of the Youtube viewings and will be pre-ordering series two as soon as that's available), but I am really looking forward to seeing the whole series on the large screen of the TV from the comfort of my sofa.

The GCI alone is gorgeous and the designs amazing (I particularly like Starscream - very interesting and probably the most attractive of all his incarnations...) I love the Tf characters (especially Ratchet - gloriously grumpy!), and the generally understated feel to the series is wonderful. Along with the action (there is a lot of action, much of it quite violent) this is also the Transformers at home, what they do when not out saving the world. They are the heroes of this continuity, rather than being secondary to the humans - something that spoiled the films for me. This Optimus has a world-weary but still determined feel to him, and Tf: Prime Bumblebee is simply adorable. The Tf: Prime Megatron is magnificently, evilly threatening (makes his G1 counterpart look like a child throwing a tantrum, and is much more frightening than the film version), and Starscream - well, I can't help feeling sorry for him. Though his interactions with Knock Out are deliciously, darkly funny. I confess I would have preferred Ironhide to Bulkhead, but you can't have everything. Miko is also incredibly annoying. Fingers crossed she improves in the second series.

As a final note, the music is terrific!",1323993600,11,2187,4.690104166666667

4994366,5,B006JN8770,"I grew up in the 80's, when Saturday morning cartoons were worth getting up at 6am for and afternoon television was worth watching. I'm one of those people who don't mind telling you that most of what you find on TV these days and what kids have been reduced to watching is all absolute and utter crap. My brother who is about a year older than I am now has three kids of his own, so I get subjected to a lot of the crap that they're growing up with to the point where several years ago, I actually bought him The Thundercats on DVD for Christmas. His kids love it.

I was browsing Netflix, looking for something to watch before going to bed one night, probably about a month ago and I stumbled upon the Transformers Prime series. Naturally, I looked up the characters and, I'm not real big on the newer things that are coming out. The characters are usually a bit cheesy, things tend to be badly drawn and CGI today looks more like horrible claymation. I swear, most kids can do better with play dough. So, I thought since they still had the same guy as Optimus Prime, I thought, what the hell. I'll watch the first episode and see how it goes. OMG! It was awesome! I loved it and watched the whole thing. All three seasons and the little movie thing that they did to tie up lose ends. I was actually impressed by the fact that the CGI looks so good. And I loved that they stayed with the same guy who has been voicing Optimus since the beginning of Transformers.

What made me want to buy the series was the fact that I loved it so much It's definitely something that I will watch again. Many times and Netflix won't have it forever. But my mother doesn't approve of the crap that kids are watching today and she and my brother's kids had a nice discussion about how they're not going to be allowed to watch the Disney Channel anymore when they visit, because the youngest of the three is soaking up the negativity like a sponge and the other two are catching it all (trouble maker in the making).

This is something that the kids can watch on rainy days when they're here and can't go outside. And who could be a better role model for impressionable young minds than Optimus Prime?",1504137600,2,2184,4.309002433090025
4994367,5,B006JN8770,Loved it!!! I grew watching 80's Transformers. Yes it was cheesy but so was everything in the 80's. This series brings back the great voice talents of Peter Cullen & Frank Welker as Optimus Prime & Megatron in a new conflict with new characters. While keeping a lot of the old and familiar ones. It is a great show for old and new fans.,1503964800,,336,4.265625

******Possible Spoilers******
I have to admit when I first heard about this new series, I was skeptical. I hadn't been able to get into a Transformers series for a long time. And when I saw that the models for the characters looked a lot like the Bay movie versions, I was even more hesitant. Boy was I so happy to be wrong.

From the opening scenes I could tell this was something the creators had put some heart and soul into. When a character got killed off in a rather brutal way very early in the first episode, I realized the tone of the show was going to be a more serious one. And that was a welcome notion indeed.

As the show progresses you can tell everyone involved has a deep respect for the lore while somehow making this fresh and new. Peter Cullen and Frank Welker return to voice Optimus Prime and Megatron and it really lends weight to the show. You feel as if this war had been going on for a very long time. The rest of the voice cast is amazing and includes names that will be recognizable from other shows.

The characters are well fleshed out and develop along the way. The human characters had importance to the story, and never felt forced or overused to me.

The stylized CGI animation might take a little getting used to for some. It didn't bother me at all once I saw it in action.

I could probably go on and on, but I will just say again that as a longtime Transformers fan this show really hit all the right beats for me. I highly recommend checking it out.",1495411200,4,1674,4.231974921630094
4994375,5,B006JN8770,"Review by child of Mominator

I had watched a couple of Prime episodes on the Hub website and knew this was something special. I watched all of 1984 season 1 and this looked promising. I believe I had seen movies 1 & 2 as well. I got this as a birthday present and watched it the following night or so. My mom was going to bed and didn't plan on watching it with me but after the first 15 minutes my dad asked her why she was still out there. Mominators response, This is good!

My whole family sat down and watched the whole season together over a few months time and was in stellar shock at the end of the season. The cliff hanger was mind numbingly terrifying!!!!! Must watch!!!! Dont hesitate; Peter Cullen (the original Optimus Prime from 84) is Optimus Prime. Megatron is also voiced by the original actor, Frank Welker. Outstanding TV series, the plot for each episode is well done. The acting is astounding. The writing is phenomenal. The CGI is almost as good as the movies. Of course this is cleaner and safer for the whole family than the Bay-Formers.  If you love TF you definitely need to at least see this version.

Be sure to tell Hasbro Studios how much you love this! Use the picture to know how to contact them. Dont forget to ask when they are going to make another TF show like it! Make sure to ask about Transformers Prime Powerful Alliances!",1489017600,,1363,4.375494071146245

4994378,5,B006JN8770,"I found out about TP by accident. I take my 3.5yo son to the library every week and I check out dvd's for him to watch. TP was among several that we had watched and after that I was personally hooked, even though they were meant for my son to watch. I now own all 3 seasons in addition to Predacons Rising and wished there was more.

In short, Transformers: Prime, even though aimed at adults, does well with children and is an entertaining cartoon. The FX by Polygon Studios are top notch, the character development is excellent and the writing is great. I absolutely love the voice actors on the show and the different story arcs leave you wanting more. My favorite character has to be Starscream. Even though he's depicted as an evil Decepticon early on in season 1, he does bring a lot of comedy to the show. All hail Starscream! Definitely recommend.",1485475200,,855,4.480769230769231

.........
.........
.........
.........

I have never forgotten the day the moment I heard about this show's first airing. I read the cast listings and found out Peter Cullen and Frank Welker were coming in as the original voices. Since I was losing some hope on Transformers from Revenge of the Fallen (was in middle school at the time and my mother didn't want me watching that....I see why now it was awful), I want to give this show a shot. I saw the first 5 episodes when it first aired. Hearing the original voices and even some new voices in the show was something to behold. The story was pretty solid as well. From then on, I kept watching the new episodes whenever they aired till the day Predacons Rising aired.

POSTIVES: the stories and characters are what the Bay films should've had (YES especially the humans). The stories were easier to follow and the characters had personality and development. Even characters like the Con Troopers [Vehicons] had SOME identity than the Cons in the bay movies. The human characters were also enjoyable, or least more tolerable. Some of the humor was 50/50 and the script of the show was pretty good. The voice acting was incredible, including the guest actors like John Noble, Gina Torres, Clancy Brown, Dwayne Johnson, etc. Personal best truly goes to Frank Welker, for he is no stranger and was having a ball with Megatron's character. As for Peter Cullen....What more is there to say? He is still great as Optimus Prime. The animation is outstanding in later seasons (will get to more on that in the negative bit), that goes for both the characters and the backgrounds. The action of course was absolutely fun to watch. When the action gets good, it gets good. Especially between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Now, there is not much battles between them physically in the entirety of the show. But it might've done some good, because it gives us some build up and they get really intense (at least for me anyway).

NEGATIVES: One of the biggest issues I had in the show was, funny enough, the animation. I mentioned I would mention why in the positive bit, so here I go. In the first half of season 1, the animation is not horrific, but you can already tell that it is sometimes stiff and awkward (MOSTLY from the characters, both robots and humans). However, they do become more fluid and expressive eventually.  There were even some moments when the lighting and shadowing doesn't look complete. Speaking of lighting, there was one time when Megatron in the second episode had a fuzzy lighting in one scene. But the nest we see him, he is suddenly squeaky clean and shiny. Not that it is terrible. I just don't understand why they changed the lighting so quickly. After that, the lighting it either fuzzy and dim or reasonably shiny. Another big issue is the design of the characters. Don't get me wrong, it's not the wardrobe. It is, in fact the anatomy was created. I just think most of the human characters looks like new sets of plastic dolls. Course, you can argue that MAYBE that's the point so we could focus more on the Transformers....well, that's my argument anyway. It also might be the budget issues. Luckily, the animation problems only happen throughout at least most of season one. Even the backgrounds get better in the nest 2 seasons. It is not Square Enix quality by any stretch, but at least it looks pretty decent as it is from their budget. But I can also see why some people would be hesitant about it.

I also mentioned the humor of the show was 50/50. I noticed the humor is a lot better from the robots and not very much with the humans. Whenever some of the humans make a funny line, I personally think that most of them were quite cringing at times. There were also some minor puns that were a hit or miss. That's a brief complaint though.

One last complaint or rather a nit pick (SPOILERS), Optimus gets the star saber at one point in the show and Megatron wanted to get back in balance with him. So Megatron created a dark equivalent calling it (UGH) the ""DARK star saber"". I understand that maybe it's to prevent a copyright strike so getting close to a Star Wars weapon...but I KNOW there are better names for it.

FINAL VERDICT: This is the series that the Bay films should've had (despite that I still enjoy them). It had better stories, memorable characters with personalities and development, the action was fun, the voice acting was great, and the animation is amazing after the first season. I certainly recommend it to any Transformer fan.

The animation of Gen1 and the Unicron Trilogy are children of their times. There is NOTHING wrong with them but either you like it or you don't. I don't. In this version you will find bots with bodies the way I believe they truly wanted them. They appear life like in their movements. You can see the difference and individuality between characters clearly. The bodies do not appear clunky, over large, or out of place. There is a beauty to them.
I think this series is well suited to all ages though children may find the plot twists confusing. The voice actors are great and the characters are well developed. They developed a very humanness to the personalities of all the bots without taking away from the fact that they are bots.

The animation is well done, the kids don't over power the cartoon, how can you go wrong with Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime AND Frank Welker returning as Megatron!

It does borrow some elements from the live action Transformers films, but I think because its animated it handles some of them better. If I had one minor complaint, it would be that I would have liked to see a few more familiar (Autobot) faces, but despite that the characters they do have are very well done. I like some of the direction they took with the show in expanding on what G1 established, like the insecticons and predacons, etc, its a neat way to expand the mythos in a new but interesting direction.

4994473,5,B006JN8770,"Transformers: Prime is a sci-fi action show that premiered on the hub in 2011. When I heard that there was going to be a new Transformers show similar to the films (except without Micheal Bay tainting it), I had to watch it. It turns out, that not only is it similar to the films, but exceeds them in every possible way.

Unlike the films, Transformers: Prime's main characters are actually the robots. There are still humans- three kids named Jack, Miko, and Raf- but the main focus is on Optimus Prime and his team of Autobots. Of course, if they were going to make the humans the main characters of any version, it should have been this one. Simply put, these humans are the most developed (and overall likable) ones of the franchise. Even the robots (both good and bad) have much better characters than they have had previously.

The stories of the show are equally as good. Every episode is pretty much a 22 minute movie. The stories are very creative and reference previous shows. Whether the Autobots are fighting un-dead robots or trying to stop Unicron from destroying the planet, Transformers: Prime has always been able to come up with interesting stories. No Transformers show yet has had as deep of stories as this one has.

The voice acting is also spectacular. Transformers legends Peter Cullen and Frank Welker return to voice Optimus Prime and Megatron, and do it magnificently. The other actor are new, but portray the characters better than anyone else before. Steve Blum was perfectly cast as Starscream and Jeffery Combs really captures the grumpy but funny Ratchet. Even the humans have actors that deliver excellent performances.

Great characters, stories, and voice acting should be enough to make a show great, but the pros don't stop there. This show features the best animation of any cartoon show to date and has action scenes that always keep you at the edge of your seat. At this day and age where CG animation has pretty much dominated 2D animation in action shows, Transformers: Prime is one of the only shows that demonstrates why it should actually be CG. This animation is also complimented by the excellent action scenes, that are more fantasy-like than the movies.

Put it all together and you have what I consider to be the best cartoon show ever!

However once i saw the first episode i changed my mind alltogether. It appears that they finally woke up and decided to give us a good Transformers show the like i have never seen ever since Beast Wars Season 3! The show is darker than the previous incarnations but it keeps a balance with the light heated approch of B.Wars and Animated. There is also a quite delicious treat...Peter Cullen and Frank Weller are back as Optimus Prime and Megatron! Peter keeps giving a sense of wisdom to Optimus that i really have missed and Frank, oh boy, Frank performs a Megatron that you shouldn't take lightly. If you thought the original Megatron as scary, wait to see this one!
 and i was really impressed with the animation. Normally, i dislike CGI but this one is something special. And the storylines are freaking awesome!!! I will give you a small spoiler for the first season closing episode, they face Unicron but you will be blown away with what they came up for this version of the world eater.

4994478,5,B006JN8770,"The latest incarnation of the famous robots in disguise continues in Transformers Prime which debuted on The Hub in 2010 written by the writers of the live-action Transformers movies but if you were worried that this would be bad show then rest assured that Prime delivers!

The Story: The Autobots have been on Earth for years after fleeing the now deserted and war-torn world of Cybertron and undercover by the government led by Special Agent Falour and just as they were getting used to not seeing Decepticons they return under the command of Starscream while Megatron is MIA looking for an army. Team Prime is composed of Optimus, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, Arcee, Rachet, and Cliffjumper and caught up in this war are three kids named Jack, Miko, and Raff but when Megatron returns from his 3 year voyage things take a drastic turn for the Autobots...

Everything about Prime speaks volumes about how much the writers delved into the Transformers lore as well as some references to other series if you look hard enough. The CGI is fantastic for this show and is surprisingly well animated and flows smoothly! The designs for the Transformers are a blend of G1, movie, and original designs and the classic transforming sound is well intact here.

Prime takes a few risks by killing off one the members of Team Prime in the first episode to set itself apart and death is permanent in Prime so if someone dies they stay dead which really sets an atmosphere where anyone can die and that gets you invested in the show hoping your favorite Transformer will survive.

The human characters have been known to be a problem in past Transformers series coughcoughCybertroncough but here in Prime it's migrated to a degree and while they don't do much in the beginning episodes they start getting more active down the line with the exception of Miko and everyone has already hit on her for being the most annoying of the three and they're right but she starts to develop a friendship with Bulkhead so she's not TOO annoying but for this season she is (And she will be until Season 3).

4994493,5,B006JN8770,"I am a huge Transformers fan.
Comparing it to the other Transformers.
It seems like most versions of Transformers shows and movies have some element of a let down. The old series was awesome, but its dated and a bit cheesy. Beast Wars was okay, not into the animal thing as much and it was corny the graphics are hard to watch today, but I did like it at the time. The Unicron series was fun, but I didn't really like how the mythos played out and found some of it repative or also too cheesy. The live action movies were decent except for most of the humans, especially the main character. The story was shaky too and overall the movies seemed like they were trying harder to target teenage boys with sex and dirty jokes. The comics of the old days where much like the old show and when IDW took over (I know dreamwave came first) it was actually some of my favorite stuff. Great plot lines, excellent art, but hard to know what order to read it all in. The Cybertron videogames were awesome games and from what I understand are technically supposed to be in the same universe as the Prime series.

Transformers Prime takes the best of ALL of these and puts it together. The story is great and comes up with interesting concepts that help make the show not hurt it. Small details such as that they have finally found something perfect for Soundwave to turn into now that people don't use tape players anymore. A predator drone, that's just smart! The show makes lots of references to the Transformers mythos, especially the good stuff such as the history of characters on Cybertron. Something that has never really occurred on any other version of Transformers is I like the humans. I didn't think I would like some of the Transformers on the show such as Bulkhead, but I ended up liking him anyways. Its got good character development. The voice acting is perfect.
I stayed away from this show for too long because I wasn't sure I really liked the animation style, but after a couple episodes I started to really like the look and now I am like ""this just makes sense."" The Michael Bay Starscream might have the face of an angry mechanical woodchuck and the personality depth of a slug, but I cant help but love the style and look of Primes version.

I could go on and on about the reasons this show is exactly what Transformers should be. They have it right! If you have the slightest interest in Transformers or are a huge fan and haven't checked this out yet, don't question, just get it.",1373328000,,2493,4.452954048140044

Long Review: Wow. I don't even know where to start. This is, by far, the best Transformers series I've watched in a LONG TIME.
I grew up in the Armada/Energon/Cybertron generation. Armada was my favorite out of all of them, but as I look back now, I have to admit that the animation and overall crafting of the show was pretty bad. I still love it, childhood and all, but I couldn't help but think, 'I wish there was a better Transformers series. One that I could take seriously.'

Hasbro must have read my mind.

I stumbled upon this show thanks to a close friend's younger brother, who told me that I should watch it. I was hesitant when I heard that it was CGI, after the Energon/Cybertron fiascos...so I hemmed and hawed and put it off for a long time. I finally gave in, looked it up on YouTube, and watched a couple of episodes.

BOY was I wrong! I have NEVER been so wrong.

Transformers Prime is the story of a small band of Autobots on Earth, vastly outnumbered by the Decepticon army. Same story as always, right? In a way, but the writers mix it up and make it original and very enjoyable.

The main cast is small, with only six Autobots(Optimus, Ratchet, Bulkhead, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Arcee) and six main Decepticons(Megatron, Soundwave, Starscream, Knock Out, Breakdown, Airachnid), but I think that allows much more characterization and development. The voice acting is simply superb, with an all-star cast that was part of what sold me on the show. Peter Cullen(Optimus Prime), Frank Welker(Megatron), Steve Blum(Starscream), Sumalee Montano(Arcee), and Daran Norris(Knock Out) are the standouts for me, but I can't really play favorites. All of the voice actors do a smashing job of bringing their characters to life, giving them real emotion.

These characters are so well written and acted that you almost forget that they're aliens. They have such a human quality to them. It's as if the writers took the original G1 characters, found every single good quality(and bad, in the Cons' case), and multiplied it a hundred times over. Optimus is as heroic and noble as ever, and Megatron is just as evil and as you remember, perhaps even more so. Starscream is every bit as conniving, cowardly, and treacherous as he ever was, but with a slightly more sadistic spin this time around. Arcee(voiced by Sumalee Montano), the only female Autobot, is one of the ones they probably changed the most. Instead of just being there to be the ""girl"", Arcee is a tough, battle-hardened warrior with a rather tragic past. As corny as that sounds, it actually works quite well. You actually find yourself empathizing with the characters in this show, once again, because it's so well written. Ratchet, the Chief Medical Officer, is the grumpy, sarcastic ""Dr. McCoy"" of the Autobots, and has an amazing voice actor in Jeffrey Combs, of Re-Animator and Star Trek fame. His Decepticon counterpart, an entirely new character named Knock Out, is a vain, sly, smart-aleck medic who HATES getting his paint job messed up. He's like an evil cross between G1 Tracks and Sunstreaker. I could go on and on and list every single character, but I won't. You'll just have to watch the show. ;)

Even the humans are well crafted on this show. After Rad, Carlos, Alexis, Kicker, and all of the rest of the ""Unicron Trilogy"" humans, I was cringing at the thought of more annoying, whiny, useless humans. But once again, I was proven wrong. The three teenagers, Jack Darby, Raphael Esquivel, and Miko Nakadai, are actually not that annoying, and even relatable to some people, I'm sure. Humans are always necessary on a Transformers show, simply to provide a sense of scale, and these humans are very well portrayed, in my opinion. Some people might disagree, but you know. Diff'rent strokes and all that. (Whachoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?)

As I said before, the CGI was what made me put off watching this show for so long, but let me say this: Don't write something off without giving it a shot first. The animation is absolutely breathtaking. It has a smooth, almost cinematic feel to it, and the lighting is very realistic. If you get this, buy the Blu-Ray. I'm kicking myself for not doing that, and I'll probably end up breaking down and buying the Blu-Ray someday. But, that said, even in standard 720p, this show blows me away with how much detail is put into each robot model. The textures of each character's paint job are even slightly different: a touch of glitter on Arcee's finish, muted and smooth for Bulkhead, reflective and shiny for Megatron and Starscream, the detail is just ridiculous. If the 'bots get in a fight, they LOOK like they get in a fight. The textures change with the situation: A sword on sword fight is going to see a lot of scratches, while a brawl in a subterranean Energon Mine will kick up a lot of dust. Even the explosions look amazing on this show, and they aren't overused. (Michael Bay, I'm lookin' at you.)

Another thing about this show that surprised and delighted me was the fight choreography, and also the dark tone and the amount of violence. The bot-on-bot battles are just so fluid and natural looking, not too jerky and cartoony(ahem...TRANSFORMERS ANIMATED.). The interactions of some of these 'bots, particularly between Arcee and her Decepticon counterpart, Airachnid, are very dark and serious, sometimes even slightly disturbing, in tone. They have quite a history, to say the least. Some pretty dark and heavy stuff going on here, not like the shallow pasts of the G1 characters. But, baby, this ain't G1. This is one of the most violent Transformers cartoons I've ever watched. The brunt of the violence is taken by the Vehicons, the nameless Decepticon foot-soldiers, but still. These bots get blasted, blown up, stabbed, ripped apart, run over, shot, gutted, even BEHEADED. And when a character dies(yes, the potential is there), they die. They don't come back. They actually die. There's such an element of danger and tension in this show, more of a chance of seeing energon splatter than ever before. There have been times when I've been watching the show and I've gone ""Whoa, man. Did they just do that? They did!"" Of course, mind you, they're robots, so there's no actual blood, nothing overtly gory that's going to give your kid nightmares or anything.

The story of this show is also quite good. The Autobots have been on the planet Earth for some time, hiding out as, of course, robots in disguise. The Autobots are accidentally discovered by three teenagers, Jack, Miko, and Raf. Since the Decepticons would naturally target anyone perceived to be an ally of the Autobots, Optimus and his team take the three humans under their watch to protect them from harm, much to Ratchet's thoroughly amusing dismay. Megatron's plans are as evil as ever, just not quite as corny as some of his G1 schemes. He plans to raise an army of undead Cybertronians with Dark Energon to invade the Earth and conquer the planet. So naturally the Autobots have to stop him. Instead of one stand-alone episode after another, the whole story progresses with each episode, building up to an explosive season finale and a maddening cliffhanger that will leave you kicking walls in nerd rage if you don't already have Season Two on DVD. I did, so my walls were spared.

The extra features on this DVD include a ""Making Of"" special, several audio commentaries, a toy featurette, and a Season Two preview. The commentaries by the producers, artists, and voice actors behind the show are funny and informative. The ""making of"" special delves deeper into the creative process behind the show, and even gives you a tiny peek into the recording studio with the voice actors. The toy featurette is just that: a toy commercial, with the designers giving commentary. And the Season Two preview will make you question everything you ever knew about Transformers. Seriously, buy both seasons in a package, or you'll be ripping your hair out.

If you like Transformers, and aren't a G1 purist, this one's for you. Just keep an open mind! Don't be put off on how different some of the 'bots look compared to their G1 counterparts.

I'll stop there. I could talk about this show all day, but then you'd have no reason to watch it, now would you? So buy this DVD! You won't regret it.",1366070400,,8382,4.779696132596685

4994500,4,B006JN8770,"This is one of the best Transformers series to come out to date.
Peter Cullen is back as Optimus Prime, and Megatron is the near indestructable force that he was always supposed to be.
This series also draws from vertually all of the past Transformers series.
There's Vector Sigma and the Matrix of Leadership from G1.
Bumblebee and Optimus are clearly based on their movie counterparts, including Bumblebee's voicelessness and the reason for it.
Unfortunately, it also draws heavely from the Unicron Trilogy - my least favorite Transformers series (I was only actually able to get through ""Cybertron"" out of the three in that trilogy.)
From that they have the concept that Energon is found, not created (as in G1) and, worst of all, they have Unicron and Primus.

*** Spoiler ahead ***

I've always hated the idea of Unicron and Primus being some king of god-like entities, but ""Prime"" takes it one step farther (in a bad way) by making Unicron actually the Earth, and that life on Earth is an unintended creation of Unicron's. That idea was even worse than the idea in the first movie that all Earth technology was reversed engineered from Megatron. While I enjoy Transformers stories, the idea that mankind is completely dependent on them (in this case for our very existance) is insulting.",1364860800,2,1293,4.872727272727273
4994501,5,B006JN8770,I am a G1 purest. I hated the BayFormers. This is the best Transformers next to G1. The story line is great and it keeps you on your toes. If you have not seen it yet you will NOT be disappointed. PLUS NO FLAMES ON PRIME!!!,1360972800,,223,3.869565217391304
4994502,5,B006JN8770,"This review is written by a totally blind consumer.  So if you're looking for a review focussing on the visual aspects of this series, you might want to search for one of the former. Mine usually focus on plot and characters, so if you're interested just read on.

  I've been a fan of Transformers ever since I first saw More Than Meets The Eye, the amazing Generation 1 pilot, in the early 90's via blockbuster video rental.  And being a kid of the 90's, I got to experience Beast Wars and Beast Machines.  So I was very excited when I learned that The Hub was broadcasting this series.

  The voice talent is out of this world.  I'm thrilled to hear Peter Cullen reprising his roll of Optimus Prime as well as Frank Welker coming back as Megatron.  I'm sure the show is just as stunning in the visual sense.

  This show is for adults and kids alike.  I like the fact that it isn't a campy Transformers show.  I like the kids in this version.  They are by no means a type of comic relief.  The war between the noble autobots and the diabolical Decepticons is all too real for these youngsters.  Humans aren't portrayed as weak and incompetent as they were in other incarnations, however.  That's one of the things I love about this show.  The autobots and humans are working in tandem against the Cons.  They have to depend on each other in order to win the day.

  This isn't your basic oneshot episodic TV series either.  Each story furthers the overall arc of a season.  You learn more about each Transformer as the show progresses, as well as the war fought on their home planet of Cybertron which brought them to Earth.  This information concerning the past of each individual Transformer and the history of Cybertron is doled out in tantilizing puzzle pieces which always leaves the viewer wanting more.  And new characters are added to the show as time goes buy.  Need I say more?

  If you purchase the entire season, you'll of course get all 26 episodes as well as some audio commentaries.  And if you enjoy season 1, 2 is also available on DVD via amazon.com or amazon's video on demand.

  If you haven't experienced this thrilling series yet, you're really missing out.  At least purchase the first episode via amazon's video on demand and give it a chance.  I was hooked after pt. 1 of the pilot-- Darkness Rising, and have been ever since.  It's not every day one comes across a show with great writers, awesome voice talent, and very memorable characters.  This series is certainly one of those gems.  Here's hoping it lasts for at least 5 or so seasons.",1359158400,,2572,4.514161220043573

4994505,5,B006JN8770,"From the introduction of old characters to new friends, the stories start good and keep getting better.  Transformers have been known to throw kids into the mix, apparently the only people that Autobots can trust.  This time around, they are not annoying, and prove to be quite helpful.  Add in a few good adults, and we have a Human-Robot Alliance.

I appreciate the introduction of some human bad guys in this series that keeps both Autobots and Decepticons on their toes.  We learn early on that Hasbro is not pulling any punches.  Head will fly, and characters will die.  Not in the way that characters kind of die but not really.  These characters can really die.

Let us not forget that the two seasons have received a boat load of Emmy nominations and wins.  Good writiing, good characters, and a great flow from start to the dramatic cliffhanger.  You don't want to miss this one.",1357862400,,888,4.664516129032258

4994508,5,B006JN8770,"I have been a fan of Transformers for years, but I really started to love the series when Armada began back in the early 2000's. Since then, I have seen several of the other continuities that have been made, many of which I felt weren't too good. I got around to watching G1 a few years back, not long after Transformers Animated had ended. Through this, I understood some of the things that I have never picked up on in any of the shows, and understood several references made throughout the trilogy of films.

Transformers: Prime really hits home because it a mixture of the original series, the films, and the latest series of video games, while still living in its own reality. The characters are very well made, and portrayed. The animation is superb, and the action sequences are to die for. Although it is a completely CG (and very abstract) series, it is incredible, and is great for all fans of Transformers, young and old. New fans will appreciate the humor, connection to the films/games, and animation, while older fans will appreciate the callback to every single prior continuity, particularly G1.

4994529,5,B006JN8770,"As a child of the 80s I was pretty into transformers, and while I liked the first Michael Bay film, the franchise headed downhill fast. Sadly, the 80s show has not aged too well either- while it still has all the characters we loved, the animation is pretty inexcusably cheap. Transformers Prime is a great midpoint between the two, possessing all the bombastic action and production values of newer renditions of Transformers, but with the heart (and Peter Cullen and Frank Welker!) of the 80s cartoon.

There are concessions to it being a kids' show. The Autobots are saddled with not fewer than THREE teenage sidekicks, but the focus is rarely on the kids, and wisely remains on the bots. And for a children's program, Prime focuses an awful lo on revenge, torture, and straight up murder; presumable any violence directed at Robots is family friendly. It's not Devil's Due/EDW grim or anything though, and the end result is a surprisingly mature show for kids about robots that turn into cars. The overall mood is somewhat reminiscent of Batman: TAS, another kids' show adults could watch without shame.

This then is probably the best envisioning of Transformers presently available and possibly the best yet, a solid, crisply produced action show with just enough drama to make it a bit more than a glorified toy ad.*

PROS
-Looks really good (except the pilot, which is to be expected)
-Coherent plot arcs reward continuous viewing
-Great mix of new talent and classic TF voice actors

CONS
-It's a cartoon on commercial TV, so the episodes are super short
-Chris Latta is dead, and while Steven Blum does a great Starscream, nobody can truly replace Latta's unique portrayal of sniveling villainy.

Although still a kids show it has a much darker tone to the series than any of the previous series. I mean... transformers actually die! Something which never happened in the original series (aside from the 80's movie where... all of them die in the first 5 minutes). Part of what gives it the darker feel is the fact the Autobots are vastly outnumbered and even into the second season can't seem to find any more allies against the seemingly endless supply of bad guys.

Hearing both Megatron and Optimus with the original voice actors is still great and the visuals are quite good (although the quality from scene to scene can vary on this Blu-ray release).",1341273600,,837,4.617449664429531

4994561,5,B006JN8770,"It seems,there are as many Universes in which the Transformers exist these days and everyone already has their favorites. Each has a somewhat different beginning, although the characters are the same. This one seems to be a cross between G1,the movieverse, and Transformers Animated with more than a nod to each. Gone are the Witwickys and Sari Sumdac and enter Jack Darby, Rafe, and Miko, a new triad of child sidekicks. Special Agent Fowler seems to be the new adult supervisor in the mix. While there are a few downers,Miko is an adventure junkie, and Prime seems a bit more war weary, to be expected I guess after all this time, but I do miss the spark of humor he had from time to time in G1. Apparently, Primes do need to party, at least once in a while. What I find peculiar is that Bumblebee doesn't talk in words and yet Rafe can understand him.
Megatron and Starscream shine here however in flashes of brilliance and provide some of the best scenes in this series. Another pleasant surprise is the conflict between Arcee and Airachnid. At least they have improved on Ratchet as well, as he looks similar to his G1 image with all the temperment of his TFA counterpart. The storylines are much better and more up to date than I expected. Another good thing is that humans aren't always constantly depicted as ""damsels in distress"" all the time and that we can hold our own from time to time,and Silas is a half way credible earth villain to match Megatron.

4994564,5,B006JN8770,"""Transformers"", the popular entertainment franchise that many generations have grown up with, may it be playing with the toys or watching the animated series back in 1984, playing the video games or reading the comic books.

Needless to say, since the early '80s, millions have experienced ""Transformers"", especially in recent years with the release of film trilogy or the animated series which continues to air on television and of course, the many toys that continue to be popular with collectors and also children.

But within the last three years, fans have watched the animated series known as ""Transformers Animated"" becoming the latest ""Transformers"" animated series to be showcased on television beginning in 2007 and would last for three seasons through 2009.

Fans knew that there will be a newer version of the series coming out, but the question is what kind of series?

In 2010, the video game ""Transformers: War of Cybertron"" was released and was a well-received by gamers but also video game critics and it was revealed that the upcoming animated series would be set in the same universe as the video game.

And then by November 2010, Hasbro unveiled ""Transformers: Prime"", a CG animated television series which would air on The Hub and would first begin with a five-episode mini-series.  And with one season having now been completed in 2011, a second season is set to air in 2012.

And it's this latest series that has been creating a lot of buzz among fans and viewers.  With the CG animation and slightly darker storyline, the series would go on to win a Daytime Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation"" for background design and color design.

As many fans have waited for a video release of ""Transformers: Prime"" and because the series is CG-animated, many have hoped for a Blu-ray release.  And it appears that Shout! Factory has listened to the fans and are releasing ""Transformers: Prime - Season One"" on Blu-ray in March 2012.  The Blu-ray features  all 26 episodes including the 5-episode ""Darkness Rising"" mini-series.

VIDEO:

""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Anamorphic).  The CG animation for this film is absolutely wonderful as we can see details on the metal of various robots.  You can see scratches on the metal, the reflection of light and also glass windows and the reflection.  But one thing I want to add is that watching this Blu-ray release, there are details that I never saw on the DVD.  You can actually see particles, dust, smoke much clearly.  You can see scuff marks and even dirt on the robots much more clearer.

The keyword for this Blu-ray release is detail.  Having reviewed the original DVD version, having watched the series on television and now watching it in HD, the colors are vibrant, they pop!  The CG for mountainous terrain, buildings, sunlight, overall surroundings are just incredible for a television animated series.  For one, Polygon in Japan really did a fantastic job with the CG animation but most importantly, as the series progresses, not only does the series get better but there is also an improvement with the overall CG.

From Optimus Prime's glass windows on his chest showcasing reflections to Megatron's steel body and also the damage on the overall body of Cliffjumper (and even Optimus Prime during the virus episode), I was quite pleased with how this series looks!  But also the amount of detail that was put into this series.

Many TV Series tend to keep things within their budget, especially with the amount of time they have for production.  But I was quite thrilled to see how the quality but also hearing the enthusiasm of the staff (as heard on the audio commentary) in the production of ""Transformers: Prime"" and how they listen to their fans.

With that being said, I will say that the series does have its fair share of banding, so videophiles who are expecting pristine quality may be disappointed.  Fortunately, not enough to deter people, as majority of fans and children will probably not care.  Also, these scenes with banding are short and not long.  Typically seen during orange/red backgrounds primarily.

But overall, picture quality is very good.  Plenty of detail can be seen on Blu-ray and the clarity is outstanding but most importantly, black levels are nice and deep and colors are absolutely vibrant!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Transformers Prime: Season One"" is presented in DTS-HD MA 5.1.  For a series with this much action, I admit that I, personally was hoping to hear a more immersive soundtrack.  But while there are some ambience that can be heard through the surround channels, and some booms that can be heard at times, it's not as powerful or as immersive as I was hoping for it to be.  The lossless soundtrack does provide crystal clear dialogue and the musical score sounds incredible but the soundtrack does sound very good, moreso during the action sequences.

The voice acting is terrific and the fact that voice talent Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime) and Frank Welker (Megatron) of the original ""Transformers"" animated series are back for this series...Fantastic!

JUDGMENT CALL:

Is ""Transformers: Prime"" possibly the best ""Transformers"" animated series yet?  I know it's subjective for every fan that has grown up with ""Transformers"".  I grew up with G1 and I know friends who grew up with ""Transformers: Beast Wars"" and felt that was their best series ever.

But I know I'm among a small group of fans who have grown up with the series back in the '80s and still have admiration towards the various incarnations of the ""Transformers"" series, still buy the toys occasionally and are passionate about the storyline and how various studios treat the characters and to not stray too far of what fans have come to love about the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons

While the storylines of ""Transformers"" tends to change from series to series, the storyline of a battle between Autobots and the Decepticons still remains.  Especially between Optimus Prime vs. Megatron.  And as a father who has a child who is just as passionate as I was growing up with the series, I have to say that for me, ""Transformers: Prime"" is wonderful series.

By saying that, of course, G1 will always be true to my heart because I loved the amount of characters (especially the amount of toys produced) and several years ago, I gushed about how much I loved ""Transformers: Cybertron"" because of how many characters were integrated.

With ""Transformers: Prime"", I admit that I was weary at first because of the few characters featured.  Similar to ""Transformers: The Animated Series"", we had a core group of Autobots and Decepticons but I'm so used to more characters, the merrier.

Fortunately, as the series progressed, the series not only provided newer characters (even if they appeared in a standalone episode), but what I loved is the modern progression of the series.  There was a lot of thought that went into the series rather than just creating a series around the toyline.  For example, for the episode ""Predatory"", this was unlike any ""Transformers"" episode I have seen.  It was darker, but it fit the character of Airachnid.

For anyone who remembers her character, she has always been deadly and menacing, but this time around, we get to see how dark this Decepticon was in actually torturing the Autobots.  And how she collected the heads of those she killed, in a very ""Predator"" (for those old enough to remember the movies) way, as a form of trophy.  I admit that I was surprised that the writers were able to pull it off, considering that ""Transformers"" is watched by many youngsters.

But there are other stories that were crafted as if they were targeted towards the older crowd, but safe enough that children can watch it.

There is strong sense of quality with the writing for this series and by listening to the audio commentary for each episode, I was amazed.  For one, a lot of the people involved in the making of this series, grew up with ""Transformers"" and they appreciate and respect the series.  They also mention how fans have had some impact as well, so that is great that they do listen to their fans.  But when it comes to the enthusiasm, you tend to expect guys being more excited about a character but when you listen to the audio commentary, not only are the female voice talent excited, but also the female staff.  They were just as passionate and excited about what they saw onscreen and just mesmerized by various actions and so forth.

I loved hearing that enthusiasm and excitement shared by the staff and it extends to their work for this series.  And speaking of audio commentary, rarely do I watch an episode, listen to the commentary, watch an episode and listen to the audio commentary back-to-back, but with ""Transformers: Prime"", I was watching, listening and doing it for every episode with a commentary.  The audio commentary was fantastic and it's one thing to hear the crew and cast, but for ""Transformers fans, to listen and have Peter Cullen involved in an audio commentary track for an animated series is fantastic!

As for parents who are wondering, ""how old should my child be to watch this series?"".  Personally, I would say that as long as they older children, 7 or older at least.

For example, the first 5-10 minutes of the first episode of ""Transformers: Prime"" makes things clear that this is not the same type of series that many of us have grown up with.  This time around, robots...do get killed and destroyed in battle.  And while the humans will never be put in any major life threatening danger for a children's animated series, still, ""Transformers: Prime"" definitely has some darker elements.

In ""Predatory"", Airachnid sees a camper and looks at the person as her first prey.  In ""Speed Metal"", people are drag racing and their are some moments where you felt, wow...is someone going to die?  But of course, no humans are going to die in this series, but as for the robots, you will see death coming to a few.  So, parental guidance is suggested if you have a young child with you, otherwise, the series is quite safe.  And granted, parents may remind their kids to not follow the actions of the three human characters (ie. getting aboard freight trains, breaking into museums, etc.).

As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned for the special featuers, the audio commentary is fantastic.  A lot of information that a viewer can learn about the actual process of making the series.  While there are some banding issues during some scenes with a lot of red and orange, these scenes are very short and if anything, most people would probably not notice, but for those of us who review Blu-rays or videophiles who really look for it, then you will see it.  I do wish the audio was much more immersive in terms of LFE (subwoofer usage) and more use of audio (ie panning audio or surround sound usage) during the action sequences, but once again, that is me being picky.  Otherwise, the lossless soundtrack is still very good for a TV animated series.

And as mentioned earlier, the CG animation for this series is great!  Typically, there are a lot of shortcuts taken on TV series but the creators of the series definitely made sure there was a lot of detail on both the Autobots and Decepticons but also various objects and environments.  So, animation for ""Transformers: Prime"" was much more than I expected for an animated series but I admit, it is the most ambitious ""Transformers"" animated series yet but the crew managed to pull it off with great efficacy.

And as for the voice acting, the voice acting is wonderful!  I was surprised was how many big names they brought in to do voices for the characters.  Legendary Optimus Prime voice actor Peter Cullen and legendary Megatron voice actor Frank Welker (""G.I. Joe"", ""Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends"") are back.  They are joined by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (of WWE fame and ""Fast Five"") as Cliffjumper,  Steve Blum (Logan/Wolverine for ""X-Men"") as Starscream and Ernie Hudson (""Oz"", ""Ghostbusters"") as Agent Fowler.  But for any longtime ""Transformers"" fan, the fact that Cullen and Welker are back to do the voices for Optimus and Megatron is fantastic!

For those who purchased ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"" on DVD, it's important to note that the five mini-series episodes featured on this Blu-ray are five episodes and not the combined episodes that would make an uninterrupted movie which was featured in the DVD release.  Also, the special features that were on that DVD, are not included on this Blu-ray release.  So, for those who own ""Transformers: Prime - Darkness Rising"", you definitely want to hang on to it!

Overall, as a longtime ""Transformers"" fan, and as a fan who has appreciated every series, ""Transformers Prime: Season One"" is an enjoyable, beautiful and well-acted series.  While I know there are fans who have their preference of which season is their best ""Transformers"" series, as a fan and a father, I felt that the creators of this series did a fantastic job in creating a series that will appeal to the new generation of ""Transformers"" fans but also many of us who older but are still young at heart.

As for the Blu-ray release, I found ""Transformers: Prime - Season One - Limited Edition"" to be a fantastic release especially with the amount of content included.  If you are a fan of ""Transformers"" or a father who wants to experience the series with their children, I highly recommend ""Transformers: Prime Season One"" on Blu!",1336176000,8,16082,4.997367431365175
4994565,5,B006JN8770,"I've been a Transformers fan for my entire life and am a bit of a G1 purist. Despite that, I think this show is great and is what Generation 1 should have been. The writers take the best parts of the Transformers lore and create a consistent narrative while adding new elements of their own to the series. The voice work is great as well. Peter Cullen and Frank Welker return to voice Optimus Prime and Megatron, respectively. This is always welcome in my book. Steve Blum's work as the voice of Starscream is really well done too.

The art style of the show seems like it's somewhat inspired by the Michael Bay movies, but the robot bodies are much smoother. The people do look a bit cartoonish, but the rendering is very good. The robot bodies are highly reflective and you can see parts of the environment reflecting off them. I remember being impressed when I noticed that you could see the reflection of Starscream's arms on his chest. This show looks amazing in full 1080p. The ads in the beginning of the disc made me worry about the overall quality, but once you get to the episodes, everything looks great.

There are some things I don't care for. For instance, Bumblebee cannot speak. He makes beeps and other robotic noises to communicate. The Autobots can understand him, but you and the human characters (with the exception of one kid) can't. Soundwave doesn't speak at all. There are adult and child characters in the show. While they're nowhere near as horrible to watch as they were in Transformers Animated, I personally would prefer if they were cut back, specifically the kids. Don't get me wrong, there are some human enemies that are worthwhile and add some interesting conflict, but I prefer the drama in a Transformers anything to be focused on Transformers.

Despite those nit-picky items, this show is great and well worth watching for any Transformers fan. The visual quality of the episodes on the Blu-ray is great too. This was well worth my money.",1335571200,,1976,4.688760806916426

4994567,5,B006JN8770,"I first started watching this show on Netflix last week when it was added.  I cannot express how much I'm in love with this show.

The just got so much right in this show, it's hard to put it all into words.  It's beyond what I could have expected and I am totally hooked.  I'm even naming my next motorcycle Arcee because I love the character so much in this show! Haha!

This is must buy if your fan of Transformers.,1334534400,,342,4.622950819672131

4994570,5,B006JN8770,"I firat discovered Transformers Prime one day on HUB with the episode where the children get lost in a trans-dimensional phase shift during a Land Bridge accident. Watched a little bit of it and was a bit turned off by the kids and especially by the way they were animated.  (Too cartoony for my tastes.)  Then fast forward a few months later, and I turned it on again...ironically, it was the same episode!  But then I made an attempt to catch a different episode and what I saw was awesome and really showed the theme of the show.  I think it was the episode where Ratchet took his suped-up Energon and weent on a Decepticon butt kicking spree.  From that episode, I realoized that this wasn't just another dumbed dcown child-centric Transformers series that would get criticized by die-hard fans from G1 nostaliga.  Tranformers: RiD anyone?

Well, after hearing more about this series, and watching an episode here and there, I decided to take a chance on buying the Blu-ray set of Season 1.  And after having watched it, all I can say is EPIC.  The story lines and the character development, along with the Michael Bay-esk violence in the fight scenes was enough to sell me that Transformers Prime is the finest Transformers series...probably ever.  Yes, I'm even going over G1.  Sure, that was a cool seires in the early '80s when I was just 10 years old or so, with early '80s animation technology...God, that series looks bad todsy.  Hell, even Beast Wars from the late '90s is showing its age now.  Shame that series wasn't done today.  Could have been really cool in HD and higher definition graphics.

But anyway, I couldn't be happier with the way this series is turning out.  From the Michael Bay inspired character designs (hey, I like those...especially as they've kind of become canon to a whole new generation of TF fans), to the well choreographed fight scenes...I mean some of them are absolutely brutal.  The fight between Optimus and Megatron in ""One Shall Fall"" is nothing short of EPIC, and I seriously mean that.  Could have come straight out of the films.  And then the following 3-parter seasonb finale ""One Shall Rise"" about Unicron is also pretty EPIC.

Now then, one note about the PQ on the Blu-ray set itself.  For the most part, it's excllent.  Fine detail in the robots is very good.  See every speck of scratches, dents, dirt, etc. is clear.  But there's one big problem across the whole season.  Color Banding.  In environmental objects, you will see ""moving"" color bands creep across these objects.  However, this is most probably an issue with the source material, ie. CG animation.  For some reason, large areas of CG animation that isn't textured much, ie. skies, walls, etc. will exhibit this sort of banding.  It's just the nature of the beast.  It's somewhat distracting, but not to the point that it ruins the story.",1333929600,,2858,4.738336713995944
4994571,5,B006JN8770,"Got this, and was only recently able to work my way though it.  This is without a doubt the one of the best incarnations of the franchise I've seen in a long time.  The only let down was the supposed sneak peek at season 2, which turned out to be nothing more than Orion getting a Con brand.  But the audio commentary was top notch and the makimg of segments more than made up for that.  Seriously, if you're a Trans-Fan, this is the edition you want for Transformers Prime.",1333756800,,474,4.233333333333333

Prime re-does how the Transformers came to and fight on earth but in a way that is as fun as the 1980s with a very mature depth in its plot and characters.

My biggest gripe against Transformers series (since the late 90s) has been the human kids that have tagged along.  The first few episodes had me worried.  But as the season completed the kids involvement became believable and added to the robots personality development.

4994589,5,B006JN8770,"If you've got a bone to pick with Michael Bay and his live-action, senses-shattering (but not in the best way) TRANSFORMERS film franchise, then why not tune in to Hub's marvelous CG-animated TRANSFORMERS: PRIME? The first season is out on DVD. It's a better reimagining than Bay's own robots in disguise.

This incarnation plonks the Autobots in the desert outskirts of Jasper, Nevada, as they make do with a remote bunker as their base of operations. The series opens with the five-part ""Darkness Rising"" arc as our heroic 'bots deal with the Decepticons' reappearance after three years of hunkering down. A driven Megatron, returned from years spent in outer space, is obsessed with harvesting dark energon, that bent element which creates zombie Transformers (the 'con leader means to raise an army of these undead). Megatron's quest is a recurring sub-plot which pays off huge in the season finale. But to demonstrate that this series isn't messing about, an Autobot falls very early on.

Fans of the original animated series, as well as of the intervening iterations, will recognize the affectionate nods this show bestows. I don't know that TRANSFORMERS PRIME deepens the mythology as much as reshuffles it around some. But it does well in establishing the lore of this current continuity. The characters are well-defined; the cast is kept to a relatively small core number. The Autobot crew is composed of five robots, few enough that the writers are able to invest in solid character development. Each Autobot gets showcased. Heck, on the opposing side, even lesser 'cons like Knockout and Breakdown get their moment in the sun. Two memorable characters are introduced in the shapes of the sadistic Aerachnid (Gina Torres) and the snarky Decepticon medic (and drag race enthusiast) Knockout. But the old hands are still well represented. The cowardly Starscream is still scheming away. Everyone's favorite muscle car, Bumblebee, still channels R2-D2. Peter Cullen again lends his awesome pipes to the noble Optimus Prime. He's reunited with his longtime foil, Frank Welker who once more voices Megatron.

As is its wont, the franchise recruits children to the Autobots' cause. In the first episode, three kids - Jack, Miko, and Raf - individually stumble onto the existence of these 30-foot-tall bio-mechanical aliens, leaving Optimus no choice but to appoint three of his warriors to act as their respective guardians. I've always enjoyed the inclusion of humans as they act as our point-of-view characters. Except that the impulsive Miko is really irritating, always scampering off against orders and getting underfoot. The Autobots' allies also number two human adults: the Autobots' liaison to the U.S. government, Special Agent Fowler (Ernie Hudson), and ***SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THIS SENTENCE*** later, Jack's no-nonsense mom June Darby (Markie Post). I think a TRANSFORMERS show will always need humans, if nothing else, so as to establish a sense of scale.

The CG is amazing, a feast of sleek visual designs and thrilling robot-on-robot violence that is very well executed. In episode 4 of the ""Darkness Rising"" arc, there's a sequence in which the camera shoots from a human's P.O.V. while a robot melee rages on. This sequence really gets you a feel for how chaotic and scary a metal on metal scrap can be and how tiny and insignificant humans are compared to these giant battling robots. The stage direction of these combat scenes is exhilarating stuff. TRANSFORMERS PRIME treats us to storytelling that is rich and compelling and humorous and with an eye towards a grand scope. The majestic score only adds to the grandiose vibe. What's more, there's a clear emotional thru-line. The stories are darker and more violent than in past series. I love that the episodes tend to advance the overarching plot.

It's appreciated that the big bads don't simply consist of Decepticons. One of my favorite episodes is the hilarious ""Scrapheap"" which finds the Autobot headquarters infested with the metal-devouring Scraplets, touted by an apprehensive Ratchet as the ""most dangerous vermin ever to crawl upon the face of Cybertron."" It's massive fun watching these giant robot warriors turn into these jumpy, squealing pansies. The episode ""Convoy"" not only unveils the McGuffinish ""Dingus"" device (a prototype energy source) but also introduces M.E.C.H., a human mercenary organization headed by the opportunistic Silas (Clancy Brown, in fine sinister form). In my opinion, all the episodes are terrific, with this season bookended by the epic ""Darkness Rising"" and ""One Shall Rise"" arcs. ""One Shall Rise"" concerns the doom prophecy long ago proclaimed by the Cybetron Ancients. As the dreaded Chaos Bringer awakens from its eons of slumber, freakish global catastrophes threaten to devastate the world. Time for the Autobots to roll out. The ""Oh hell no--!!"" cliffhanger ending is frustrating but in a good way. In fact, the DVD set's 19 seconds of the Season 2 Preview had me wailing for Season 2 to arrive already (thank Primus it's already here). TRANSFORMERS PRIME has to be considered the best series yet in this long-enduring franchise. And I love Arcee.

4994591,5,B006JN8770,"""Transformers: Prime"" is the latest computer animated television series detailing  the millennia-long conflict between factions of a race of ""autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron,"" the Autobots and the Decepticons. These  beings have the amazing ability to transform themselves into different mechanical forms. The Autobots are led by the noble Optimus Prime, while the Decepticons are lorded over by the tyrannical Megatron. ""Transformers: Prime - Season One"" is a 4 DVD or Blu-ray set collecting all 26 episodes of the show's premier season.

""Transformers: Prime"" is also part of a multi-media franchise that dates back to 1984. Inspired by Japanese toys, the Transformers concept would eventually encompass not just toys but television series, comics, video games, movies and more. Over its almost 30 year history, the Transformers franchise has created a massive mythology for its ever growing cast of robotic and human characters. The complex challenge the creators of ""Transformers: Prime"" faced was continuing the dramatic adventures of the Autobots and the Decepticons with new stories that paid homage to the established mythology, while furthering the saga with their own distinctive vision. This endeavor also had to appeal to a fan base that reached back nearly 3 decades. Yet most significantly, ""Transformers: Prime"" had to entertain a new generation of potential Transformers enthusiasts from a target audience of 6 to 11 year old children.

While this reviewer is too mature to critique this series from a young person's perspective, I can offer my impressions of ""Transformers: Prime"" from the point of view of someone who can remember the days when the first Transformers series (now called Generation One or G1) debuted on American television in the early 1980's...and I can say sincerely, I love this show!!

Season One of ""Transformers: Prime"" sets a serious tone from its premier episode, ""Darkness Rising (Part 1),"" even as it introduces the audience to revised versions of robot characters long a part of the Transformers mythos. The centuries-long war between the Autobots and the Decepticons has ravaged their homeworld of Cybertron. As the series begins, the characters reside on Earth, ""robots in disguise,"" hiding among humanity in the forms of common automobiles, aircraft and motorcycles. But the struggle between the Decepticons and the Autobots remains a life and death conflict even on another planet and this is shown in a very violent way as the series' first story unfolds. Robotic life is lost as the ancient animosity escalates once again, and unsuspecting humans become participants in the bitter battle between the alien forces of good and evil.

""Transformers: Prime"" offers a great deal to appeal to fans of the popular franchise and its history. For this reviewer, a major plus is the show's voice cast. Across the board, they are excellent; but first and foremost, special mention must be made to Peter Cullen, the man that gives life to the heroic Optimus Prime, and Frank Welker, the actor who makes the evil Megatron sound so insidious. This dynamic duo were the original voice creators of these characters from the first Transformers TV series and ""Transformers: Prime"" marks the first time Mister Cullen and Mister Welker have worked together on the animated mythos since those long ago days almost 30 years ago.

Mr. Cullen's contemporary interpretation of Optimus Prime reveals a leader who has become older and wiser...yet a leader who is also burdened with the legacy of the ages-old conflict between his fellow Autobots and their adversaries, the Decepticons. Over the millennia, Optimus has become an iconic figure of nobility within the Transformers universe and in the Transformers fan community. This persona has come to be revered by many fans as an embodiment of the heroic ideal. But it has also come to be criticized by fans who find the heroic status of the Autobot leader, and Mr. Cullen's vocal characterization of Optimus Prime to be boring. This particular Transformers fan stands firmly on the side of those who admire what Optimus Prime represents: the compassionate comrade, the noble warrior and the inspiring leader...and as voiced by the gifted, distinctively deep tones of Peter Cullen, Optimus Prime makes the ultimate robotic good guy look and sound cool!!

Mr. Welker brings a modern malevolent vocal characterization to Megatron, the evil master of the Decepticons. Gone is nearly all of the bombast of the tyrannical robot of Generation One. In ""Transformers: Prime,"" the mego-mania of Megatron's ambition remains, but Mr. Welker gives his performance a sometimes more subtle temperament; which makes it just as menacing. His brutal nature still reigns supreme, however, and those who cross Megatron are right to fear his wraith, including those who serve him. A continuing subject of his volatile personality is Starscream, the Decepticon leader's untrustworthy and conniving second in command, played with devious delight by Steve Blum.

An interesting character dynamic between Optimus and Megatron is also touched on in the early episodes of ""Transformers: Prime."" On more than one occasion, the series writers have Megatron speak about his ancient adversary in almost respectful terms. During a particularly intense battle scene in (what I consider an all-time classic) ""Darkness Rising (Part 4),"" Megatron actually compliments Optimus, stating he's ""still at the top of your game!"" Then in the concluding episode of ""Darkness Rising (Part 5),"" the leader of the Decepticons remarks, ""Optimus Prime never disappoints..."" Prime himself is shown reflecting on his long relationship with Megatron in the episode ""Masters and Students,"" wondering what might have been if they hadn't become enemies over the many millennia. I found this to be a refreshing and enriching take on these 2 characters, words and thoughts that added nuance to who these warriors were.

The stand-out character in ""Transformers: Prime"" for this reviewer is the Autobot warrior Arcee, who has been totally redesigned for this version of the Transformers mythos. Arcee is a no-nonsense soldier deeply scarred by the long war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, but a true comrade in arms to her fellow battle-hardened compatriots. She transforms into a sleek, powerful motorcycle, and it is in her vehicle mode that Arcee first attracts the attention of the teenaged human, Jack Darby. Their relationship begins very reluctantly but as the show progress, the bond Arcee and Jack develop becomes a highpoint of the entire series. The characters are wonderfully played by Sumalee Montano (as Arcee) and Josh Keaton (as Jack Darby). It also doesn't hurt that Arcee is no longer colored pink as in her early incarnations but rather a beautiful gleaming blue in her robot and motorcycle forms...which is my favorite color!

The computer graphic imagery of ""Transformers: Prime"" is darkly dramatic, displaying the serious ambiance of the series. The robotic characters have a sleeker design sense than in past Transformers shows (Well, except for Bulkhead!) As this is a story of war, the viewer can see the effects the clash of metal fists have on metal bodies: scars, scraped paint (skin?) and scuffs mark the characters, adding to the reality of their constant war-time existence. It is a nice touch done by the series' character designers and animators.

""Transformers: Prime's"" young human co-stars, Jack Darby, Miko Nakadai, and Rafael ""Raf"" Esquivel, are traditional cartoon based in their design, a wise move when it comes to animating the human form with computers. The human figure can oftentimes be perceived as looking too mechanical in computer animation. This problem would only be compounded in a TV series centered on robotic characters. Fortunately, the interplay between the show's human and robot characters works, strengthened by the writing and the vocal talents of the special cast of voice actors.

Finally, the quality of the ""Transformers: Prime"" series is heightened even more by the music composed by Bryan Tyler. Mr. Tyler was given the opportunity to write an orchestral score for the series, a rare thing for an American animated cartoon, and he created a soundtrack that is worthy of a big budget feature film. This reviewer is happy to report that Mr. Tyler's music for the series has been released on CD.

To conclude, ""Transformers: Prime"" is a high quality production that is an impressive new chapter in the Transformers mythos. To fans of the Transformers saga and to animation in general, I give it my whole-hearted recommendation.

Long live Optimus Prime!!",1331856000,4,8670,5.272463768115942

Although advertised as a children's cartoon, the overall them is darker and deeper. The writing is quite clever - the episodes that were not 100% essential to the plot did not feel like fillers either.

Characters are well developed with a rich backstory while still paying homage to their G1 roots.

Would recommend this series for any viewer.

-Hope season 2 proves as powerful as this season.

4994593,4,B006JN8770,"I'm a longtime fan of the transformers since the original show in 1984.  I have seen most of the diff shows since then like beast wars, beast machines, cybertron etc etc.  I had never seen this particular TF show prior to getting this dvd set but i heard alot of good things about it so i took the plunge and bought the 1st season.  I think it's just fantastic to hear Peter Cullen and Frank Welker reprise their roles from my childhood and they still sound great, as all the other VA's do a fine job as well, i just wish bumblebee talked, im not a fan of the mute movie version that hasbro seems to prefer these days.  I like most of the characters fine especially Megatron and soundwave in particular( a couple i wish had gotten more screen time but if i said more it might spoil things).  I'm not crazy about the designs on some of them as they come across as tinker toys in appearance.  I was particularly surprised by the 3 human kids in the show as i was expecting to hate them as most of the kids in prior tf cartoons are downright annoying and whiny.  I think these 3 kids are the best thing since spike and sparkplug(though miko gets on my nerves a bit at times)

I don't regret my purchase and think it's a fine series, it's addicting as one episode leads to another and has that you just can't watch one episode feel going for it.  I'm defintely looking forward to season 2's release. I still don't think it beats the 1980's series myself but that's personal preference.",1331424000,5,1481,4.298561151079137
4994594,5,B006JN8770,"Although I wasn't really a big fan of Transformers: Animated, I was surprised when I heard that Hasbro was already giving the Transormers franchise yet another reboot for TV. Hasbro has been on a real roll lately with their TV re-launches of classic franchises on their new network ""The Hub""-- everything from G.I. Joe to My Little Pony has been getting another shot on TV, and the results thus far have not disappointed-- and in many cases, they've surpassed their G1 counterparts. While many in the TF fandom insist that the original version is still the best, in my opinion Prime surpasses it. The characters feel a lot more three-dimensional, the writing and voice acting is a lot less campy, and the animation is gorgeous-- and until recently, I would have been hesitant to say that about a CG animated TV show. Between this, Clone Wars, Kung Fu Panda and the upcoming Green Lantern series, CG animation on TV is definitely proving itself a viable medium.

If you want a smartly written action show with the explosive action as Michael Bay's movie trilogy, this show is for you. It's got a little bit of just about every incarnation of Transformers somewhere in there, all stirred up with a few new ingredients of its own. If you have kids they're going to love it, and if you are a fan of the franchise or animation in general you will probably love it too.",1329609600,,1363,4.632231404958677
4994595,5,B006JN8770,"This series is awesome! I was a huge fan of the original Transformers series and over the years have kept tabs on the additional shows that were added to the body of work which is the Transformers, including beast Wars and now Prime, and from what I can see and from what I have experienced, Prime tends to pull together the best in all of them. If you have never seen Transformers Prime but are a fan of the Transformers then this set is for you. Filled with the entire first season of the series, you will get your fill of the Transformers in their glory and I know that you will love every minute of it! Great animation and plot will also transfix you throughout the entire 10 hours of the Blu-ray! This is a must have for any true fan!",1329004800,,739,4.211267605633803
4994596,5,B006JN8770,"I stumbled across TF:Prime while watching a new channel one day and thought ""what the heck. Why not"" I am a HUGE fan of the original series (G1) and grew up watching the Autobots and Decepticons wage their war across my TV, comics, and living room floor. I was not too sure I would like the animation style of the series based off the commercials I saw... but then I watched the pilot episode and was hooked! The stories are great! The characters are well done and entertaining. The whole series keeps the feel of the originals while creating a fresh start for a new generation of fans. I would like to see more Autobots arrive to balance out the growing number of Decepticons, but the underdog feel is good and lends a more heroic quality to the characters.
I would give the series a 10 out of 10 for season one. I loved the season finale and am eagerly awaiting the start of season 2!",1328313600,3,886,4.343373493975903
4994597,5,B006JN8770,"I had tried to watch the new version of the G.I. Joe cartoon, and felt that I miss the more dramatic older version. And  yes I am being tongue-in-cheek. The original was corny, no one ever got hurt, and well now that we know that we have won half the battle. So little thought it seemed was put in the new version, it was too cartoony. but I mean that in a bad way. So when I heard there was another version of Transformers, I started to cringe, I wasn't too impressed with Beast Wars. Though it was great CGI and had some great stories, overall I didn't really get into, and felt as if I was watching a totally different cartoon, other than the great Transformers. of Course G1 wasn't perfect, but for the day it was released it was awesome, great stories (even though it seemed like a great way to sell the toys) it was as if, they knew they'd sell toys but didn't want to be caught doing a 30 minute commercial so they actually gave it great story lines and characters you'd care about. With beast wars it just didn't seem very transformer-ish. It just didn't seem to create the same drama and pathos as the original. It would be the same if we find out the once and all powerful Optimus transformed into a teddy bear and Megatron transformed into strawberry shortcake. This is Transformers not barbie and friends, why so cutesie? If I seem a bit elitist and bitter, it's because I loved the original so much (as well with the theatrical movie) that I just feel if you're going to revive an old franchise you need to show proper respect. One wouldn't replace the original cast of the Godfather with the women from Golden Girls. True they were great and funny, but they aren't on the same page as mobsters. So I feel with transformers that transforming to animals was a bit much. I also felt Voltron made little sense when they switched from vehicles to lions. But, maybe It is just me. maybe everyone else totally loved Beast Wars and to a new generation (my goddaughter and her brother were first introduced to Transfomers with BW, this was probably their favorites. Next they will probably be reviving Tranzor Z. They've already weirded me out with Thundercats. So I went ahead and DVR'ed this series, figuring if it sucked there's always the delete option. However, I found myself totally intrigued by th is incarnation. of course I caught it halfway in the season, and on an HD channel even sucky shows can seem better than they are. But, this show was great just based on stories/characters. Just like the original. I was skeptical about a female transformers. They've always been such a boys club. However, she's great too, she's not just thrown in there to have a female character either, she has a rich back story, and an interesting relationship with the kids. I do not understand why there aren't more mainstream characters though. Like one reviewer said we may get rewarded later on. Bulk Head is a better character than I thought he would be by far. I didn't know why they got a lesser know to be a story driver, but it works. Ratchet seems like a no-brainer even though he's not one of my favorites, I did like some of his story lines in the comics. I would have rather seen them without a medic and have someone who has to wear many hats, fumbling about (but not comically) trying hard to make things right but not having the medical background. Though since they are Robots maybe I should say mechanical. I also wish Bumble Bee would talk again, why was he mute in the later movies, after he started to talk already? Who cares, the movies were just eye candy, both with Megan Fox and the Robots/Special Effects/CGI. The picture on this series is stunning. I do love how they hold on to some older narratives from the past yet giving it a whole new direction, such as working with the government. I'm also glac that they show everyone as ""human"" The female isn't a girl in distress or a token  female she has a great story arc as well as having great skills/ You wouldn't expect a motorcycle to kick ass the way she does. She is pretty much the Biker Babe of the group. She can hold her own with the boys, and yet have a sensitive interaction with the kids, and the mom. I am also glad they added more humans, the three kids give you more room to move/grow than with just say Spike and his dad. Oh and I hate cliff hangers, lol especially when I was able to watch these episodes in a row on my dvr having to wait for season two sucks. But it's worth the wait that's for sure, I love the job they did, it looks and sounds great, and I don't feel that i'm watching some retro 80's throwback, where people of today pretend like they know what itw as like growing up in that time. I have no complaints about this series (though I'd like to see more main characters...I am glad at the ways they introduce the ones they do show. My only gripe, and this may be because it is a cartoon so no one can get as seriously hurt as in the movies, I think there are way too many decepticons for this small group to fight against. We see hordes of generic decepticons but in reality the sheer numbers would overwhelm them no matter how skilled they are. That being said this is definitely one of those cartoons that children would love, and appreciate, and makes adult children even happier. No matter how much cartoons say they aim for a younger audience, in reality they tend to reach the older ones more. We just sometimes use the kids as an excuse to watch a cartoon. With so many animated shows on (remember when the only time you'd see animation in prime time is when Charlie Brown would have a new special?) it's easy to just dismiss this as another movie/toy tie-in, but this is no cash in attempt the characters and story lines are genuine and will keep you interested til the end. So I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves great action and characters and of course I recommend it to anyone who is into animation. This is a definite must see.",1328054400,,5958,4.40562613430127
4994598,5,B006JN8770,"Transformers: Prime is one of those rare shows that are targeted at children but made with the adult fans and collectors in mind. The show cherry picks the very best from the diverse canon of the Transformers universe and blends them in with its very original storys and style. This is easily the best TF series since Kenner & Mainframe were brought together to reboot the (at the time) failing Hasbro property with 'Beast Wars' three seasons of the best character driven story telling the Transformers franchise has seen up until the arrival of TF: Prime.

8499657,5,B006JN8770,"(My daughter wanted to leave a review, and here it is.)
Alright! Since I thoroughly enjoyed and watched this show, I thought itd be nice to write a review for it. Beware of my possibly biased opinions!
First of all, I was very happy to receive the full disk set earlier than they had said it would be coming. It was quite a beautiful surprise, but at a bit of a cost. The plastic on the DVD case looked like someone had booped it with a pencil once or twice, but of course that didn't ruin the overall condition of the DVDs. Im just a bit of a perfectionist and was a little dismayed to see it had been mishandled before even reaching my home. I enjoyed the way the disks were set up in the case; easy to find and decorative. If you're looking for a specific episode you don't have to pop it into the DVD player unless you don't know the episodes name. They have the episodes listed in order inside the DVD case. The DVD menu is simple enough, and even if there were rather few bonus features, you won't be able to find them elsewhere. Theres some footage of a few of the voice actors being reviewed, some clips from a convention the Transformers Prime team attended, and a making of video if I recall sharply correct.
As for the overall show, I find that for the most part it appears to be specially crafted for early teens and up. I would give it that rating primarily because of the violence and maybe the few hidden adult jokes. So about that, there is quite a lot of violence, but since this is taken place in the middle of a war for Earth it is definitely to be expected. Still, even I was a bit surprised at a few of the sadistic acts in it; most on the Decepticons side of course(the majority of it was Starscream abuse- <:]).
I wouldnt recommend this for younger children who haven't been exposed to some content along these lines before. They may get a little blown away or frightened by all the uh.. Energon shed. But even then, it isn't unheard of for entire families with kids ranging from all ages to sit down and enjoy it together. My own younger siblings 5-9 seem to really enjoy it a lot even with all the violence and whatnot. We used to have a special night where we would play our Transformers Prime disks during the week and theyd jump around and yell in excitement, haha. So regardless of what I rate it, it is ultimately up to the parent if they want their kids watching the (cool) stuff.
Moreover, I guess I wouldnt recommend this to any die-hard fans of the early original series. This show is very very different and has come quite a ways away from what it used to be, so if you're stuck in the past you may have a hard time embracing the future here. But with all its hidden surprises, if you're just curious I assure you it will be worth your time and money~
Ive enjoyed and relished in every episode so far since I bought it, and I will keep rewatching it and rewatching it for as long as it remains in our household and maybe even after then. Honestly, Transformers Prime is altogether a really great show. Even a.. Show of the ages perhaps~?
So whether you're into Transformers or just starting out, this is a good series to pick up for the binge-watching.",1513382400,,3187,4.2868988391376455
