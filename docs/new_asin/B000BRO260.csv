A high-priced item, but well worth the tab for Natalie fans, or someone who can relate to the crises depicted by the 'inmates'.",1456185600,,315,5.3

8091585,5,B000BRO260,"Natalie Wood is fantastic in this well written TV movie. Mental breakdowns, alcoholism, marital problems, issues with mom... this movie covers a lot of ground in just over an hour and a half. It easily could've been a total downer, but Natalie Wood makes it entertaining and thought provoking to watch. How did she not get an Emmy for her performance in this one??",1369008000,,364,4.703125

8091587,5,B000BRO260,"Burt Brinckerhoff's exceptional made-for-television movie ""The Cracker Factory"" based upon the Joyce Rebeta-Burditt book of the same name offers a phenomenal performance by the late, great Natalie Wood. Natalie Wood shines as Cassie Barrett, a suburban alcoholic housewife who's in and out of the local hospital mental ward. She gives a rare look into the turbulent life of a wife and mother who suffers from depression, alcoholism and slight mental difficulty. Wood's Cassie Barrett is a spunky, bright individual looking for answers as to why she can't seem to handle her own life, while others do. Wood is warm, witty, intelligent and adds a special glow to this perceptive film.",1131840000,12,682,5.209090909090909
