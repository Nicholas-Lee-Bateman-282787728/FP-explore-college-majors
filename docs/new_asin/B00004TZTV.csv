7923304,4,B00004TZTV,"The film shown on this Amazon page is a drama about a twelve year old boy (David Arnott) raised by a single mom (Goldie Hawn), who happens to be a stripper, in Key West in 1969. It's a well-made film with good acting, but nothing special; it grabs your attention to the situation, but never really resolves it very insightfully.
Most reviewers here have mistakenly written about the 1949 Burt Lancaster film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criss-Cross/dp/0783213115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criss Cross</a>&nbsp;which takes place in Los Angeles, not Key West.
So which is this, the Goldie Hawn movie, shown, or the Burt Lancaster film, as described?  I guess I'd give both 4 stars, but would like to know what I'm buying!",1164412800,,766,5.660869565217391
