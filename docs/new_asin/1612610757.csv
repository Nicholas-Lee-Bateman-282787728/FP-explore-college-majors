8324494,4,1612610757,"I had my high school juniors and seniors read The Jesus Creed for Students this Spring as a text for our Biblical Ethics course. The book and the course were complementary, since both used Jesus' Sermon on the Mount as a base text. I'm grateful to Paraclete Press for sending me a complimentary review copy of the companion resource: The Jesus Creed for Students DVD, which features brief segments in which Scot McKnight summarizes and comments on key points of each chapter in the book.
Like the book chapters, each video section is succinct, pointed and challenging. At about 5 minutes apiece, they are a good length for reminding students of the key concepts in the chapter and launching a class discussion, but they don't dominate a whole class period or do your teaching for you.
My one disappointment is that some of the video sessions basically repeat the content of the book chapter, with little else. Others, however, take a fresh angle or add something beyond the book's content. These are the more useful.
The content of both the book and video is excellent. McKnight's deep understanding of the text is presented with precision and clarity in a voice that is accessible and enjoyable for young people. I heard numerous positive comments about the book from my students. (There's a more detailed review of the book on my blog at [...].) And this supplementary video is a great tool for engaging those students who groan about reading, but readily engage with visual media. Thank you Scot, Chris, Syler and Paraclete Press, for producing these resources that meet the urgent need for materials that are theologically informed, thought-provoking and accessible to young adults!",1337385600,2,1686,4.96113074204947
