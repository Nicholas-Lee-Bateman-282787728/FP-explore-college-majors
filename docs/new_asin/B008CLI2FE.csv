This DVD is a great collection of six episodes perfect to get kids in the Halloween mood and Fall.  I am sure though we will be watching this far past Halloween!  The episodes are wholesome and appropriate for preschoolers, with lessons such as working together, responsibility, patience and more.  It is not scary either, just fun and exciting for any Thomas, Bob or Fireman Sam fan!

8526796,5,B008CLI2FE,"For any child that enjoys Thomas the Train, Fireman Sam or Bob the Builder, this is a great compilation of Halloween/spooky themed episodes that all will enjoy. This is out at a perfect time of year when you can simply sit back and enjoy the episodes while getting ready for Halloween. Saying this though, the episodes do stand on their own and can be watched at any point during the year too. If your kids are already fans of these shows, I highly recommend this compilation, as it was definitely a hit with my youngest!",1348185600,,521,4.494736842105263
