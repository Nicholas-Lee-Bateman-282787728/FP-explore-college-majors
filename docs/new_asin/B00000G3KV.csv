1215987,5,B00000G3KV,"This video is excellent.  It teaches a good message about forgiveness.  I love the dance that Bob and Larry do to entertain the customers.  Also, I love it at the end of the movie when Larry keeps saying,  ""Bamboo.""  That is so funny!",960336000,,234,4.348837209302325
1215988,3,B00000G3KV,"The second video in the series, this VT ep didn't quite reach the quality that later videos would reach.  I imagine this is because the authors were still new at making movies.  The first half of the video, about the grapes of wrath, has no plot whatsoever and is merely a lesson.  It is not  presented in a very interesting way.  The second half, the gilligan's  island parody, was much more amusing and presented better music and a great  message in a fun way.  It still wasn't as good as the others, but it was  decent.  The Forgive-o-matic sequence really made me happy.  I loved that  part a lot.  A good movie, but if you're looking to buy the best in the  series, this isn't it.",956361600,2,685,4.333333333333333
1215989,3,B00000G3KV,"This one, of all the Veggie Tales videos, tends to get in your face more than the other titles in the series. It's still lots of fun, especially the Gilligan's Island spoof, but the charm of the Veggies has always been their  unusual way of teaching their lessons without preaching.  This one is a lot  more ""Brady Bunch"" than anything else, with Dad Asparagus doing a  lot of sermonizing in the first segment.  It's not as funny or clever as  the rest, and the ""Forgive-O-matic"" sequence just isn't a good  substitute for the usual ""Silly Songs with Larry"" segment that  almost all the other videos have.  It's still heads and tales over the  other stuff on the market, but I won't be re-watching this one the way I do  the others, and when I do I'll fast forward to the ""Larry's  Lagoon"" portion and skip the first two parts.",944092800,2,827,4.476510067114094

1216232,5,B00000G3KV,"The very first Veggie Tales, and I think I enjoy watching it more than watching the new ones.  The graphics are so goofey and it's got good jokes, but it teaches good lessons, and isn't afraid to mention God.  It seems Big Idea has been a little commercialized lately.",1324598400,,268,4.448979591836735
1216233,1,B00000G3KV,"I love VeggieTales. My kids love VeggieTales. We got rid of this video.

Many people have mentioned that this video is one of the worst animation-wise. They also mention that the stories are not as exciting. These things are true but the main reason to pass on this video is the lesson. The video repeats, over and over, ""if they say they are sorry, and really mean it, you should forgive them."" This is not right. We are not supposed to be going around requesting apologies and determining sincerity before we forgive.

Now, it is important to note that forgiving does not mean that pretending that nothing is wrong. Using the example of another reviewer, if a woman is abused by her spouse she should work on forgiving the spouse, whether or not he apologizes and is sincere. She should also not continue to allow herself to be put in that situation, whether or not he apologizes and is sincere. God wants us to move past areas where we've been wronged with forgiveness instead of resentment but we are not to be stupid either.

This VeggieTales is wrong on both counts. It focuses on doling out limited forgiveness and then that forgiveness forcing you into staying in a potentially hurtful situation. Pass on this video.

The other VeggieTales videos are great (if not a little too dumb for adults.) If you are looking for a great tool in moral development try Adventures is Odyssey. There are videos but mostly some REALLY GREAT radio shows. My husband and I listened to them growing up and still enjoy Adventures Odyssey time.",1320796800,5,1532,4.684014869888476

1216257,5,B00000G3KV,"VeggieTales are without a doubt the most wonderful shows my children own.  They teach my children wonderful values.  They are very entertaining to watch; both for kids and adults alike.  The pre-schoolers in my class at church stay absolutely glued to the episodes.  My own teen children are still fond of them (they have been watching them since childhood), and my husband and I enjoy them too.  This particular set, ""God Wants Me to Forgive Them?"" is my favorite of all of the VeggieTales.  It has many funny, memorable lines, that my family have been quoting for years.",1271289600,,572,4.785714285714286

1216294,5,B00000G3KV,"Sorry to hear the previous buyer got a damaged copy. They should return it instead of giving the movie a bad review. This was a wonderful illustration on forgiveness. It shows how kindness and forgiveness can change the hearts of others and how good it feels to forgive, even when we are hurt. It is just another fabulous Veggie movie!",1134086400,12,335,4.6
1216295,3,B00000G3KV,This DVD was so scratched up that the second-half would not work. It just skips.,1128297600,,80,4.4
1216296,5,B00000G3KV,"This was a very funny video.  I liked the story of the Grapes of Wrath.  The  part where Jr. Asperagus says, ""Sure I forgive them for calling me Beanboy and telling me I have peas on my head, but now they're making fun of my name and laughed when the pole almost knocked my head straaaaaight off and then the truck tipped up and threw me in the SAND!""  Larry's Lagoon's funniest part is when the professor makes a helicopter out of bamboo and they sing the forgiveness song with a talking tree.

My son who is seven asked me to post this review.  He's a big Veggie Tales fan.  I really like them too.",1116806400,,600,4.165217391304348
1216297,2,B00000G3KV,"This is one of their earlier efforts, and it's clear they were still finding their feet, so to speak. The music is excellent as always, but the writing just doesn't measure up. Both segments are preachy and not very funny, with awkward comedic timing and pat, contrived dialogue and situations. With the ""Gilligan's Island"" spoof they overreached themselved, as they just didn't have the computer power available to them to satisfactorily render some of the effects they were going for. Roman Catholic and Orthodox parents will probably object to the gratuitous shot at the sacrament of Confession that occupies the space between the two segments. It's almost worth seeing for the introduction of Pa Grape, but since his personality undergoes a complete transformation in later videos you don't lose much by not seeing him here. This one's very missable, which is too bad because it's trying to put across a lesson that's absolutely central to the Christian message.",1044748800,2,966,5.120253164556962
1216298,5,B00000G3KV,"This is a wonderful movie especially for young children. There are two stories in this video, including ""The Grapes of Wrath"", which is about sort of a hick family that is very rude that Junior Asparagus sets back on the right track. The other story is Larry as ""Gilligan"" and Bob as ""the Skipper"". They use their real names in the story, but it is obvious that these are the characters they are supposed to be portraying. The whole video is about forgiveness (obviously) and how God can work in your hearts, even when you are very little.",1034208000,6,539,4.510204081632653
1216299,5,B00000G3KV,"Come on... you know you'll laugh.
This is far more than a parody of Gilligan's Island, but a tool to teach your children about forgiveness. Some messages need reinforcement more than others, and forgiveness is one of them.
Better than any sugar-coated message, ""VeggieTales - God Wants Me to Forgive Them?"" is excellent for parents and babysitters alike.
CCD and Sunday School teachers also will find this useful for getting an age-old lesson across.
I fully recommend this video.

1216300,2,B00000G3KV,This disappointing video suffers both from the comparatively crude animation and slow pacing of the early VeggieTales work and from two boring stories. My children reach for this VeggieTales video far less than they reach for any of the others in our collection.,988934400,,262,5.116279069767442
1216301,3,B00000G3KV,"This is not one of the best VeggieTales Videos [as mentioned in previous reviews, it is an early one - they just keep getting better!].  It is still a very funny and entertaining video though, and we just adore the whole VeggieTales series at our house.
However, in place of the Silly Song with Larry in the middle segment, Big Idea has an ""Infomercial"" for the ""Forgive-O-Matic"".  Many Catholics, including myself, feel that this is actually intended as a slight against the Sacrament of Reconciliation [Confession].  It is a mis-interpretation of the meaning of the Sacrament, and could be confusing to young Catholics.  I'd be prepared as a Catholic parent to use this video as a great stepping off point for discussing the beauty and meaning behind Reconciliation - that way you can still enjoy a funny video with the kids and not have them subtly brainwashed while you do it.",975542400,10,880,4.80794701986755
1216302,4,B00000G3KV,"This is a very good early VeggieTales.  They didn't quite hit their peak  yet with this one.  They do 2 segments instead of one larger segment.  In  between there is no song, but the Forgive-o-matic section is still good.  It's just no Silly Song.
This is a very good lesson for kids.  When  someone asks for forgiveness, give it to them.  I would note only one  thing.  A person who is truly sorry will do more than say he or she is  sorry.  That isn't mentioned in the video, but I also think it is an  oversight.  However, I have to keep in mind that it is geared towards kids.  Big Idea is trying to get the general message across, which they do very  well.  The parents need to be around to make sure the message in their head  doesn't become one of cheap grace.  We don't want our kids coming up to us  asking forgiveness when all they really want is to get out of trouble and  they genuinely aren't sorry.  But, as I said, this is more of a note than a  critique.  I highly recommend the video.",966816000,5,1001,4.1421052631578945
