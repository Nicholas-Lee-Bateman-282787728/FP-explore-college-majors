3683761,5,B001LIYCDG,"This DVD, which I got with an Amazon gift card, was easy to find, in great, like new condition aside from a little wear on the outer slipcover, a good value, and was shipped with the other DVD I got on the same card in great time. I'm pleased.",1265846400,2,243,3.979591836734694
3683762,3,B001LIYCDG,"Haven't watched the special features, but the BluRay + comic book will certainly go over well on Xmas.  Unfortunately the digital copy offer expired in November, and I really wanted that or a standard def disc so my kids can watch it in the car.  That means I'll have to fork out another $10 for a standard def disc... hope I can get a partial refund from the vendor to cover it.",1261008000,4,379,4.25
3683763,4,B001LIYCDG,I originally bought this sight unseen.  I loved it immediately.  Anything STAR WARS will usually go well with me.  I also liked the comic book and exclusive artwork.  I bought one for my nephews birthday and he immediately took out the comic and started reading.  He was happy with the whole package as well.,1249344000,5,308,4.62962962962963
8318206,5,B001LIYCDG,"Great movie and series. Very cool booklet of artwork and extras. plenty of special features on the disc as well.

One TINY little annoyance is the discs packaging. There is an ugly little corrugated cardboard insert that's meant to keep the disc flush with the booklet and outer sleeve. Would have been nice to have something a little nicer looking to fill that gap, but still 5 stars for sure.",1448409600,,394,4.628571428571429

8318211,3,B001LIYCDG,"I liked the tv series, just getting around to watching it. My only complaint is that i was shipped a spanish comic. my fault for not inspecting sooner. Other than that it was as described and shipped in good shape",1327968000,,213,4.35

8318213,5,B001LIYCDG,"The extra cost involved with the movie is completely worth it for the collectible book you get in the package.  I won't even deduct a star for the crappy packaging everything comes in-a sleeve with the jewel cased movie, the book that won't even fit in a regular sized DVD case, and a piece of cardboard because the sleeve is too big for just the movie and the book-WTF?????  No point in reviewing the movie, you're not reading this for the above product to find out if it's good, there's too many other versions of the movie available for cheaper.  A warning about the packaging, but if you're in to geeky things to collect and show off to people that might care, spend the extra money and find your own way to store the book.",1317513600,6,727,4.37037037037037
8318214,4,B001LIYCDG,"In the computer animated feature film, ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"", the way is paved for the Clone Wars TV series by introducing Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to his new Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, a young girl who is as strikingly spirited and independent as himself. Through the course of the film, the pair, along with R2-D2, Obi Wan-Kenobi, Yoda, Padme Amidala, and other friends, including an army of Clone Troopers, battle with Separatists, negotiate with Hutts, and take on droids and Sith warriors alike, all on a mission to save Jabba the Hutt's baby son, Rotta, from mysterious kidnappers. It's a thrilling adventure story that does a great job setting up for the TV show. However, I don't feel it quite does enough to separate itself from the show, storywise or in terms of quality, to feel like it ever belonged on the big screen. Nevertheless, it did go there, and I bought a ticket. I don't regret it, but I did feel like I was watching a TV show pilot the whole time. A GREAT LOOKING TV show pilot, though.

As on the show that followed this film, the visuals are excellent, even if I personally prefer the traditional animation of the previous Clone Wars TV series. The designs here were based on those old puppet TV shows of the 60's that they were spoofing in the movie ""Team America: World Police"", which took some getting used to in Star Wars. Padme is hotter in 2D, but she still looks great here, as does Ahsoka, and it is just cool to be getting new Star Wars stories in animated format. I always wanted to see them make more Star Wars films using animation (though my dream was 2D animation and stories following Return of the Jedi). The voice cast here is awesome too, and Sam Jackson and Christopher Lee even returned to voice Mace Windu and Count Dooku. That's pretty cool! Plus, it's no wonder Ahsoka's voice is sooo yummy. She's voiced by hotty-hot hotty Ashley Eckstein, whom I was already familiar with from her previous television work. You'll enjoy ogling Ashley in the bonus features. As for the story itself, it's more kid-aimed than previous Star Wars features, but not without adult qualities all together, and it's a lot of fun thanks to the new characters like Ahsoka and Ziro the Hutt, but much like with the TV series, there are times I am prone to zoning out when it is just a lot of battlefield action. That sort of thing has never held my attention well, which is why it's a little disappointing for me that once George Lucas finally got back to making Star Wars stuff, it gradually became all Clone Wars focused. I am more interested in rebels and bounty hunters, and princesses and Wookies (and Ewoks; Yes, I love Ewoks). But, Ahsoka and Padme provide enough eye candy to keep me interested in this new branch of the Star Wars phenomenon, and this film is definitely a great introduction and was better than some of the episodes I have seen so far. I have a lot of catching up to do though.

The bonus features are pretty great here. You get a commentary with video, a memory game, a bunch of deleted scenes and trailers, a production gallery, and some great behind the scenes webisodes and featurettes. Much of it seems to be focused on promoting the TV show, but this movie is not far removed from the show, so it kinda works. Now, if you're like me and got the 2 disc gift set with comic book, here's the deal with that. The second disc, as far as I can tell, is just a digital copy. I never use those myself, but I hear it is already expired. Besides a different cover though, you also get a really nice little graphic novel from Dark Horse comics. I used to read their Star Wars stuff all the time when I could afford comics! I haven't gotten to read this one yet, but the art looks good. Oddly, the cover is rough textured rather than glossy, but besides that, it is a fine quality 92 page book that I could totally see being for sale on its own along with the further volumes (which DO sell on their own under the title, Clone Wars Adventures). I wouldn't mind eventually getting the books that followed this promo copy (I do have one of the post-Jedi series that came out simultaneously, and one of the short-lived Indiana Jones Adventures). Anyway, the set is a nice buy and nice way to give this as a gift, though I guess the only extra you're getting is the book since I hear the digital copy is expired. Depending on the price, you might just as well get the movie-only version. I do recommend a Star Wars fan pick this up though. It's worthwhile, especially if you like the TV series.",1315612800,5,4540,4.468674698795181
8318215,5,B001LIYCDG,"Good time.. surprised that I liked this as much as I did.  Love the TV series too.. and this theatrical movie kicked the show off..  If you are looking for the TV show pilot.. this is it.  If you know a kid who watches the TV show.. they should have this movie.

Gave my nephew the comic book that came with this edition... he's 9.. he loved it.",1309046400,,345,4.029411764705882
