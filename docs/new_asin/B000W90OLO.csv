8221718,1,B000W90OLO,"The only thing likeable is some of the scenery. The worst thing has got to be the falooky story of chasing 15 million, the dwarf, the skeletal guy and the hombre gordo -- my version is in Spanish. I do not want to hear this film in English. A tired flick from the start without grace, without reason and without interest. Nobody comes off well in this film -- and I'm a fan of Dale Robertson's, who is passable as the hero of this non-movie. Watch it if you have a copy in Spanish, like I do.",1517961600,,492,4.082474226804123

8221725,4,B000W90OLO,Dale Robertson stars in this  Spy drama.  While  it doesn't  compare to James Bond it is and entertaining movie  and includes one of the  female  stars from Thunderbolt. I recommend it.,1403308800,3,185,4.774193548387097
8221726,4,B000W90OLO,Gotta say that the interrogation scene with the lead female character was one of the big reasons for watching this one.  From what I've heard the Amazon scene has been shortened (as it has in most copies -- particularly in the US).  The longer scene is of interest to fans of the damsel-in-distress kind of movie.,1379721600,,313,4.571428571428571
8221727,3,B000W90OLO,"There is a lot of action in ""The One Eyed Soldiers"", an obscure but enjoyable European spy movie, but very little sense. In fact, none at all. It is like someone had a bare outline for a potentially interesting thriller but neglected to fill in any of the connecting dots.",1357948800,,272,4.46
