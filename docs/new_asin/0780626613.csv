Still when bad guys strike again, randomly bombing buildings, Jackie's reinstated to Jackie's former position- until Jackie gets kidnapped and tortured.",1037059200,,289,5.170212765957447

Police Story the best ever made to date as JC would agree.

The fight in the playground was completely awesome and the ending fight wasn't too bad  either.  A must see for Jackie Chan fans.",963187200,,261,3.980769230769231
32656,4,0780626613,"One of Chan's better films.  It has only 3 fight scenes(restaurant, playground, warehouse) but each is progressively bigger and better than the previous one.  I liked the glass-wearing bad guy who keeps trying to kill  Chan, but gets beaten up every time he tries.  But Maggie Cheung as  Jackie's girlfriend was a bit hard to take, and so was the romance subplot.  Overall, really good, but not in the best or elite Chan films.  But go  ahead and get it.",950400000,,454,4.5875

32679,2,0780626613,"I love this show, this is what police work is really about! Police Story follows stories written by LAPD SGT. Joseph Wambaugh, who was a police officer and detective in the 60's and 70's with the LAPD. Shows focused on the real lives of the officers at work and away from work, bringing a more humanistic take on their lives and their careers. Sadly, I wanted to love this release and I have been waiting 6 years? since Shout Factory released season 1. Season 2 has some ok story lines but not as great as season 1. Sadly, Shout Factory puts a disclaimer on ALL DVD's stating that these are the best sources used to make a transfer to DVD. I have no idea what they did to season 1, it looks amazing! Season 2 on the other hand looks horrible. The video quality is so bad that you can see the changes in quality right before your eyes! When scenes go from light to dark, you see the lack of quality.

Stop whining about the quality or companies like shout factory or timeless media & mill creek will not release them at all! I love old tv shows but do not expect blu ray quality. I'm just happy to be able to watch them again at all! Be happy we can go back in time and enjoy great nostalgic memories.",1503705600,2,403,4.113924050632911
32682,3,0780626613,"Great to have finally received the second season of Police Story but as some recent reviewers have mentioned,the quality of this DVD set falls short of the season one set. I have only watched the first episode so far and have quickly skimmed through many others. I can concur that the picture appears quite faded and running time for each episode is just over 46 minutes (cut down about four minutes) except for the extended last episode. The Columbia/Sony fanfare in the closing titles looks around early 1990s and maybe this is the best quality masters Sony had available for Shout Factory. Or, maybe there was no real effort to put together a complete and restored version.
If the first episode is anything to go by, the story lines for the rest of the season should still be good but the quality of the actual DVD set makes me feel that a price of well under $20 would more realistic. If the rest of the available masters are of the same quality then could be an opportunity for Mill Creek Entertainment to release them instead. Minus one star for picture quality and another for incomplete episodes.",1503705600,6,1104,4.637755102040816

32685,2,0780626613,"After waiting 6 years (since 2011 when Shout Factory released Season One of Police Story), I eagerly purchased this item on the first day it became available (August 15, 2017). I have several other dvd products from Shout Factory and, up until now, they have never disappointed.

As soon as I put in disc one of Season Two, the following message comes on the screen:

""The following episodes of Police Story were mastered from the best available video sources.""

This message is on all 6 discs and it's a flat-out LIE in the first place. Why? Because Season One of Police Story was wonderfully mastered and those episodes (as common sense will tell you) are OLDER than the episodes of this season by one full year (the 1973-1974 television season). The fact that the first season episodes were so clear in both picture and sound yet these second season episodes are extremely inferior to season one in both picture and sound quality is ample proof that Shout Factory was too cheap to remaster the original NBC episodes. If any episodes were to be of poorer quality, it would be older episodes because they are....older!!

Therefore, the above-mentioned message wants the viewers of these discs to actually believe that the entire second season of Police Story is not as ""well-preserved"" as the first season. Nonsense. And that's not the worst part........

THE WORST PART is that each and every one of the episodes on the 6 discs of Season Two are the ""syndicated"" versions of Police Story and not the ""complete"" and ""uncut"" episodes that were presented on all of the discs of Season One!!! This means that 4-5 minutes of each episode is missing! When this season aired (in the 1974-1975 television season), one-hour shows were approximately 50 minutes in length (with approximately 10 minutes of commercials). As time went on, one-hour shows became shorter in length in order to increase the commercial time (so, for example, today's one-hour shows are approximately 41 minutes in length with approximately 19 minutes of commercials).

Now....you may ask.....""What happens when a tv station broadcasts an old tv show like Police Story?"".....well, sad to say....the stations do not reduce the commercial time so that people can enjoy watching the full episodes as they originally aired, oh no, that would be too generous. Instead, they keep the same commercial time as shows airing today but remove several minutes of the old tv show episode to make it fit into the length of the modern one-hour tv show.

The Bottom Line: So what you get here is 45-46 minutes of a 50 minute show (the sources of these videos were taken from a time when commercials were longer than they were in 1974-1975 but shorter than they are now in a one-hour time slot). Since one is currently unable to watch the episodes from when they originally aired on NBC in 1974-1975, it's almost impossible to know for sure what scenes were removed from every episode. Maybe there were some very significant scenes removed which added depth to some of the characters. Unfortunately, we may never know.

Also (while Season One came with a nice, blue pamphlet inside the dvd case describing each episode), Season Two lacks any pamphlet but includes the episode descriptions and air dates (very cheaply) on the back of the DVD cover slide! So if you want to read what all of the episodes are about, you have to take out the 1st and 6th discs to read them. I give this product a 2-star rating because ""any Police Story episodes are better than no Police Story episodes.""

Since I had to wait 6 years for this deceptive release, I will not hold my breath for the release of other great tv shows (e.g. Toma, The Name of the Game, Hec Ramsey), at least not from Shout Factory.",1503100800,7,3736,4.7708978328173375

32689,5,0780626613,"The following is the episode guide for season 2 of Police Story originally aired in 1974 -5, an outstanding anthology series with an incredible lineup of famous guest stars.

************************************************** Update August 28 2017 **************************************
As some other reviewers have noted, these are the syndicated (shortened) versions of these episodes. This is a situation similar to the later seasons of Barnaby Jones, that were released last year, where many of the episodes were the syndicated (cut) versions. And like that series where the video was not remastered, I find the video quality  of this set to be still quite good, a 7.5 out of 10 .The storylines are quite interesting, and there are a lot of Famous stars from the past, that makes this set a worthwhile  purchase.

directly related pressures on their personal lives.

I placed the very first  review ( or plea to have the show released)  for Season 1 .back in October 2009 and
it was  finally released in September 2011 after many others also were asking for the show to be released.
Now we have had to wait another 6 years for this second series. I hope Shout Factory (who do a great job
of releasing these great old shows)  will release the rest of the seasons in a much quicker time frame.
I note season 1 now has 141 customer reviews and still holds a 5 star rating which relates to how good
the show is.

In the meantime  whilst waiting 6 years I have seen other great old police shows which I can recommend -
The Streets of San Francisco, Hunter, Crime Story, Kojak, The Untouchables, Naked City, The FBI,
Hawaii 5 O, Walker Texas Ranger , Policewoman, Harry O, Adam 12, The Mod Squad, Baretta,
The Rookies ,Swat ,Nypd Blues.and I have to mention The Fugitive even though it is not a police show.

Tom Ku's employees from the first film are bothering him. The real bad guys in Police Story 2 are a bunch of money hungry terrorists who are setting bombs off in shopping malls! Jackie Chan was given a larger budget and he uses Hollywood style pyrotechnics to blow up shopping malls and buildings! Maggie Cheung is back as Chan's suffering girlfriend May. The Hong Kong version of the film is longer and it has a couple of vulgar gags! There's a lot of bone-crunching action in this movie. Bad guys fly out of windows and the camera follows them as they smash into the ground! Chan leaps onto a bus, flips over a sign, and flies through a window! Police Story 2 has its share of 1980's paraphernalia. Men and women wear neon colored clothes and puffy hair. The scene where guys on a playground try to beat up Chan was neat! Chan leaps onto the hood of a jeep in the nick of time before it crushes him into the wall! Chan once tried to reject the use of computer generated imagery in filmmaking, but after The Tuxedo(2002) and The Medallion(2003), he's jumped on the bandwagon. I love Police Story 2 and it's better than some of Chan recent movies.",1308096000,2,1285,4.4491525423728815
32710,4,0780626613,"Sequels in the 1980s and early 90s tended to be retellings of the original story.  Sure, time had passed between the events of the first and second films and screenwriters would make a reasonable attempt to make obligatory mention of what happened the first time around, but largely sequels were designed to give us more of the same.  The 80s/90s, if I have my chronology correct, were before the Lord of the Ringses and Pirates of the Carribeanses, movies that tried to string a single narrative through multiple films.  The definition of a sequel and remake were dangerously close during this era of movie history.  Ghostbusters 2 made the gang once again face an influx of supernatural activity in New York, leading to yet another climax where a giant creature walks the streets of the city; Predator 2 transplants the same plot into an urban location; Die Hard 2: Die Harder, apparently afraid the audience will not realize the similarities between the first and second movie, takes immense pleasure in having characters point out how much the movie's events have in common with the original film, as if to say, ""Hey, remember that movie you really liked, Die Hard.  Well, this is a lot like that.""

 Apparently Jackie Chan doesn't like to hit the reset button because Police Story 2 not only deals with the fallout from the first film, but makes these consequences an important, if not always central, part of the movie.  In fact, the opening title is translated as Police Story, Part 2.  I think the ""part"" subtitle tends to class up the place.  It's a way for the filmmaker to tell you that he's not in it for the money.  He just wants to finish the grand narrative he began with the first one.  As if to remind the viewer of the eyeball searing awesomeness of the original, Police Story 2 begins with a montage of the greatest hits from the first film set to the rousing ""Police Story Theme.""  We then pick up the story in what appears to be mere days after the events of the first film with Ka Kui Chan facing repercussions for going rogue.  While Chan's superiors, Superintendent Li and ""Uncle"" Bill, chastise him for his violent, impulsive means, they still respect him as a police officer and the ends his unconventional actions result in.  Both have convinced the higher ups that Chan should not be ejected from the force.  Instead they demote Chan to traffic duty.

 While directing traffic, Chan is confronted by the villains from the first film, Chu Tao and his lawyer John Ko.  Because he has contracted a terminal illness that gives him less than three months to live, Tao was granted a compassionate release by the Hong Kong prison system.  Ko proceeds to harassed Chan and his girlfriend May by rolling up to their apartment and issuing barely veiled threats.  Later, he makes good on these threats when he unleashes a handful of henchmen conveniently proficient in Kung Fu on Chan and May in an empty park at night.  In addition to worrying about enemies out of the past, Chan must also contend with blackmailers who are threatening to blow up buildings owned by some corporate conglomerate unless they cough up ten million dollars.

 Police Story 2 improves on the original in at least one area: the character of May.  In the first movie May served as the irrationally jealous girlfriend and occasional point of comic relief.  Unfortunately, this meant the outrageous action was often sideswiped by dubious humor and stereotypes that were more than a little offensive.  In the sequel, May is allowed to be a fuller character whose grievances are legitimate and feelings for Chan are reciprocated.  May is introduced to the story when she thoughtfully brings Chan water while he is on duty directing traffic in the scorching heat.  At times May becomes subject to a disproportionate amount of abuse, whether she has been capture by the film's villains or whether Chan's forgetfulness causes her to spend over ten hours in a jail cell (long story), but unlike in the first film, at least her affection for Chan is mutual, which provides the inevitable damsel in distress routine with actual dramatic weight.

 As is the case for most Jackie Chan pictures, Police Story 2 boasts some mesmerizing action sequences, including Chan dodging billboards while surfing the roof of a bus and a phenomenal fight in a school playground.  This is the second Jackie Chan film I've seen that makes use of a playground to stage action, and it's a fitting metaphor for the kind of mental and physical play required to choreograph Chan's brutal ballet.  Just as children transform parts of a playground into whatever their imagination requires of it--a swing might be used belly down to simulate the flying feats of a superhero or a slide might be climbed in reverse to mimic ascending the Himalayas--Jackie Chan transforms everyday urban ephemera into elements of a coliseum arena.  Just as much as his swift choreography, Jackie Chan's knack for incorporating every day objects into his set pieces have contributed to the success of his films.

 While the action doesn't quite reach the delirious heights of the first film (very few films do), Police Story 2 improves on all of those areas in-between.  The humor routinely hits the mark (even if there are a few wide swings), especially a bit where Chan gives a rousing speech where he wishes the villains would take his life instead of those of innocent civilians, which his bosses both immediately steal verbatim when facing the higher ups.  As Chan and his investigators attempt to uncover who's behind the bombings, the movie relies more heavily on the genre of police procedural rather than the original's use of Dirty Harry's rogue cop archetype.  Police Story 2 may lack some of the discipline of the first film--the dueling plots (semi-spoiler alert) never fully entwine at the end--but it nevertheless offers up vintage Jackie Chan at the height of his popularity as a Hong Kong action star.",1307836800,3,5955,4.829556650246305

32712,4,0780626613,"As night follows day, box office smash hits will get their bigger-budgeted sequels. But while POLICE STORY 2 is bigger, it isn't necessarily better. It's actually a terrific film. I'm just saying it's not as good as the first. But it's definitely worth a look, especially if you haven't seen the 122 minute long version. If you've only seen the much edited international release, then you haven't seen the real thing. Either way, Jackie Chan is still singing that theme song.

For his reckless actions in the first POLICE STORY (demolishing a squatter village, wrecking a mall, holding the police superintendent hostage, etc.) Detective Chan Ka Kui (Jackie) of the Royal Hong Kong Police is demoted to traffic duty. But when the mob boss he had arrested (again from the first POLICE STORY) is released from prison - because apparently he only has three months left to live - Ka Kui and his girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung, getting more screen time) become targets of the mob boss's vengeance. But that's only one set of thugs. Ka Kui also ends up tangling with vicious bomb extortionists and taking on that tiny little formidable deaf-mute martial artist whose only mangled uttered words sound like ""Abba, abba."" Detective Chan Ka Kui persists in being a loose cannon, and I'm astonished that in the next sequel he isn't demoted to the permanent assignment of getting cats out of trees.

Jackie's trademark slapstick is toned down as his character maintains that incredible intensity for the most part. There are those running gags with the guy whose glasses kept getting cracked and also with Uncle Bill's toilet issues. Even more than the first movie - which to me sort of echoed the Dirty Harry flicks in tone - POLICE STORY 2 is immersed in the police procedural, to the extent that the middle third of the film tends to drag a bit. This is when Ka Kui joins the maverick Special Tactical Unit which specializes in undercover work. In the surveillance sequences, Jackie is relegated to a supervisory position. At times, he's not even in the heat of the action.

Seems to me that Jackie Chan has a misstep only when he wanders across the pond into Hollywood. Part of it is culture, part of it is that in Hollywood Jackie doesn't have as much say in the film-making process, and that's cost him. In the confines of Hong Kong, Jackie Chan is the absolute master of his domain, and he knows his public. In Hong Kong he gives the people what they want. Not as good as the first, POLICE STORY 2 still contains moments which blow the roof off.

Jackie Chan tried to top himself in this one. The first POLICE STORY was noted for the sheer amount of glass shattered. One of this sequel's calling cards is the number of explosions. For the final bang at the abandoned factory, Jackie, wanting it to be as memorable as he can get it, hired the best Hollywood pyrotechnics crew to stage the effects. At the time, for a Hong Kong flick, the result was impressive. The fight scenes are predictably awesome, and Jackie and the goons he takes on look convincing trading punches, and the full contact stuff looks like it hurts. If you go by the DVD's bonus segment featuring the stunt crew, it really did hurt. Maggie Cheung was injured in the head while running thru a series of falling steel frames, and if you notice, from then on, after that stunt, a body double plays May and you never do get another close-up shot of her. The best action sequence is the skirmish at the park playground, although the one in the restaurant isn't at all shabby. I also dig the sexy cop girl unit and the not exactly genteel method the girls apply in questioning the suspect.

The Dragon Dynasty's DVD release has the following special features: audio commentary by RUSH HOUR director Brett Ratner and Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan, a Brit who knows more Hong Kong action cinema trivia than perhaps any sane man should; ""Celebrating the Sequel"": a conversation with Brett Ratner and Bey Logan (00:08:25 minutes); rare alternative outtakes (00:03:15); POLICE STORY 2 Location Guide - Bey Logan walks us thru a tour of location scenes from the film (00:12:18); ""Stunts Unlimited"": members of Jackie Chan's famous stunt team talk about performing the crazy stunts for the film, and they manage to convey a sense of just how hard and dangerous their job is (00:33:32, with English sub-titles); and the Hong Kong theatrical trailer and the US promotional trailer.",1275868800,5,4433,4.729624838292367

There girlfriend who always does silly things, still did silly things, and is still constantly complaining about jackie.  Jackie himself still played a nice guy, who has to save the day doing amazing stunts.  The film even ends with the same song playing over outakes as was in the first.  Overally, it was a entertaining flick, just not that unique.  If you liked the first police story, you'll probably be happy.  If not, there's nothing to change your mind this time around.",1259884800,,733,4.584615384615384
32715,3,0780626613,"""Police Story"" wasn't my favorite Jackie Chan movie, but nobody can deny that its action, humor, and stunts were enough to raise anybody's eyebrows. Alas, much of what made the original film memorable has been undone in the sequel, to the point of there being almost no comparison between the two. It's still a pretty good action film by most standards, but nonetheless a disappointing follow-up to one of the genre's most appreciated masterpieces.

The story: the returning Ka Kui (Chan) is still a policeman, but the exploits of the previous adventure have gotten him demoted from hero to zero. On top of this, the villainous Mr. Chu (Chor Yuen) has been released from prison and promises to make life miserable for him and his unstable girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Mood-for-Love/dp/B000065R29/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Mood for Love</a>)...all whilst the police department is faced with a case involving the theft of $10 million from building tycoons by demolition-savvy terrorists.

The movie switches between an action vehicle and a police thriller more than once, with wire-planting and surveillance scenes taking precedence frequently. Frankly, I don't watch a Jackie Chan movie for stuff like that, and when it starts going on for half-hours at a time, I start losing interest. Granted, it all comes back to some good martial arts scenes, but for the most part, the film takes itself a bit too seriously (the original also did, but at least it could make up for it on a more regular basis). The only non-action aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was the continuation of Jackie's and Maggie's onscreen relationship, which peaked in a hilarious scene where Maggie shouts Chan through a shower room filled with naked, embarrassed policemen and corners him in a bathroom stall. Besides that, there's less physical comedy from Jackie, and that's not cool.

I shouldn't complain too much, though. There is a lot of cool action to fall back on...it's just not as cool as that of the original. Chan has four hand-to-hand fights: the first one against Chu's thugs in a restaurant, and while still entertaining, it's nothing we haven't seen from Jackie before (although there is a cool move where he breaks an open drawer with a man's face); the next is a more inventive follow-up fight in a park where Chan takes on an even larger group of attackers wielding metal sticks. He then has a brawl with two CID agents that's too short to warrant interest, but the movie ends on a high note with Chan taking on the three terrorists in a fireworks factory; this one includes the vast majority of the film's stuntwork (comprised of Chan the bad guys falling from very high places) and a rather impressive fight between Ka Kui and Benny Lai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Strike-Force/dp/B00008XRV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Strike Force</a>) as a deaf-mute pyromaniac.

Dragon Dynasty did a reasonably good job with the special features of this release, though they apparently shared all of the good stuff with the prequel: included are two Cantonese audio tracks and one English track in which Chan does not do his own dubbing, feature commentary by Brett Ratner and Bey Logan, a 33-minute tribute to the Jackie Chan stunt team, alternate outtakes, a location guide, and a Ratner/Logan interview...but no personal words from Chan himself. This uneven comparison shows that even Hong Kong has its problems with having sequels live up to their predecessors, and not even director Chan could shatter that stereotype. If you're a fan of Jackie's, you'll already own this, but newcomers to Dragon Dynasty should start somewhere else, regardless of the name recognition.",1242691200,,3808,5.299668874172186

32720,4,0780626613,"The first Police Story is arguably one of Jackie Chan's finest pieces of work, containing everything a good Jackie Chan film should have and then some.  Though an improved sequal is just about impossible with a film of such calibur, Police Story 2 ends up being about as good as a sequal can get.  Though the story is not as tight this time around, and I honestly felt a little bored about 2/3 through the film, there was still enough humor, action, and fun characters that made this all worthwhile.

Most of the same characers from the first film return, and then there is a new group of guys who basically bomb public buildings for ransome.  Jackie Chan begins the film fighting off his old enemies from the first film, and eventually deals with the new guys, who make you wonder if they have some connection to the other goons.  The plot was pretty engaging at first, but eventually slowed down until an explosive finale that is worth the wait.

Poilce Story 2 contains some of the most memorable action fight scenes from a Chan movie in my opinion.  There are 3 that really stuck out - the restaurant near the beginning, the playground fight at night, and the 8 minute spectacular final fight in the warehouse.  What I like a lot about the action, is not only that there is some serious choreography going on, but Jackie takes hits and gets hurt - he is not invincible.  If you stick around for the end credits & blooper reel, you can clearly see that a lot of injuries took place on the sets of this film.

Dragon Dynasty was very smart to bring Police Story 1 & 2 to dvd.  For years it was only availbale on vhs, and not the easiest film to get your hands on.  The original dubbed voices, if you are used to them, are gone in the Dragon Dynasty versions.  Not that it really matters too much, but I actually enjoyed the original dubbed voices that gave the movie a less serious feel than the newer voices.  In the end, this movie just rocks.

The villians are as despicable as you would expect a group of terrorist bombers to be and you'll definately be looking forward to them getting there heads kicked in by the end.  All that being said, sequels are suppossed to up the ante and be bigger and better... that doesn't happen here, but how could it?
