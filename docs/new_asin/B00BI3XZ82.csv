8568825,1,B00BI3XZ82,"What's wrong with this DVD?  Let's see... to start off, it's the same recording that was released as ""The Jeff Beck Group"" not that long ago; you know, the one with the wrong line-up on the case (the DVD has a picture of Jeff Beck Group #1 w/ Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, etc., when in fact it's footage of Jeff Beck Group #2 w/ Max Middleton, Cozy Powell et al). The next problem is the that this copy lists a song that isn't even on the disc (""She's a Woman""), which is actually why I wanted it in the first place. Finally, the sound is poorly synched.  If you want footage of these guys with these songs, get the original and pass on this lump.",1390521600,3,641,4.12
