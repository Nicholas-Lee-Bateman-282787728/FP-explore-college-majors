8420555,3,B004AO0HNW,"This particular title is the same disc that was released a few years ago (2006 I think)under the title Under Review:Neil Young.  Documentary with several interviews of ""Neil scholars"".  Some live footage but only stuff that is already available.  Nothing new for any Neil fan who has followed  his career, but if you have just discoved his genius, or are a casual fan it should be informative to you.",1303948800,20,400,4.753623188405797
