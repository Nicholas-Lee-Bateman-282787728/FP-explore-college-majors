7866345,3,6304234686,"We know how this remake will go right from the start as the film opens on a curvy blond in way too little clothing out for a jog.  She ignores the warnings of a strange character who tells her some of the bugs are on the warpath.
Just after her demise, the same man delivers a bunch of wasps to a shady doctor operating out of what looks like an alley.  We then jump to a model with puffy eyes who is actually the owner of a skin-care company.  She must face the fact that she is not as young and beautiful as she was.  As investors begin to maneuver for a takeover, she gets a second chance with the shady doctor's wasp serum.
Now a raving beauty (well, her eyes aren't puffy anymore, at least) she takes full control again of her company, her staff, and her love life.
All looks well, but... guess what?  Right, she turns into a giant killer wasp when she needs to (or is angry or exited or having sex or...).  But in the end the tragedy works itself out as she realizes she can not go on in this way.
Silly silly sill but a lot of fun.  The morph effects as we see her face go from model to mandibled is worth it.  The giant wasp is also really funny.  Ever see a bug in a bustier?  Great b-movie that is surprisingly better than the original.",1059523200,3,1246,4.069672131147541
7866346,2,6304234686,"I would have thought that if you were going to remake a Roger Corman film that the idea would be to improve on the original.  This would be fairly easy to do because the 1959 original of ""The Wasp Woman"" was a laughable Corman quickie, but this 1995 effort fails to clear even that low hurdle.  The story remains the same: Janice (Jennifer Rubin) not only runs a cosmetic company, she is its model.  But Janice is not a kid any more and in her quest for eternal youth and beauty she use a potion created by mad scientist Dr. Zinthorp (a slumming Daniel J. Travanti) from wasp hormones that is supposed to rejuvenate skin.  The immediate affects are wonderful as Janice returns to major babe status, but there are some serious side effects, mainly paranoid delusions and turning into a giant wasp creature.  However, this is the sexiest looking giant wasp creature you have ever seen, once you get past the cheesy makeup.  The end result is that you can pretend ""The Wasp Woman"" makes the argument that people should not judge women by their looks, but even that rather obvious position seems superfluous in the context of this Showtime film (although the wasp woman's way of teaching men the errors of your way will certainly have male viewers squirming big time in their seats).  Besides, you will spend most of your time trying to figure out how come Janice's clothes are not completely destroyed by her changing back and forth into the titular creature.  Jennifer Rubin is a good looking woman, but if you happen to be near TriBeca in New York City you can go see her at Grace restaurant where she is the current hostess instead of wasting time with this film.  ""The Wasp Woman"" was also known as ""Forbidden Beauty"" as if erasing the connection to the original Corman film would somehow enhance this one.  Go figure.",1049587200,2,1819,4.62111801242236

The character MORPHED into a wasp?  That was a waste of time.  Very unrealistic looking wasp.",963360000,,255,4.478260869565218
