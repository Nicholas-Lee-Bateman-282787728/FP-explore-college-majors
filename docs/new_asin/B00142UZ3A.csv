8254139,4,B00142UZ3A,"This Alliance release - which is all region so it works on US DVD players - gets so close to being a definitive collection but then makes one tragic mistake.

We get the original Prom Night and the remake in their widescreen aspect ratios, enhanced for 16x9 TVs. The picture for the original Prom Night does look worn out as it always has on other releases, so an upgrade to the Blu-ray is totally worth it unless you just want a single purchase to have all the movies in your collection. Prom Night remake is the unrated version, which is a plus (although this film is also available on Blu-ray). Prom Night III and IV on separate discs are an upgrade from the previous 2-on-1 release. They are both in their original full frame aspect ratios as they were when released on VHS way back when, and Prom Night III is indeed the more gore, more nudity cut - although it only runs 16 seconds longer than the edited version of the film previously released on the 2-on-1. The uncut version is often listed as being 97 minutes long compared to the edited 95 minute version, but I think that may just be inaccurate info that got spread in the Internet age.

And finally, there's the big disappointment here. If you already have The Prom Night II DVD in its 1:85:1 presentation, enhanced for widescreen TVs, you'll want to keep it, for here they've included a full frame cut of the film! And it's not from the original negative, it's actually cropped from the widescreen version. It's pretty mind boggling that they would do this with a near perfect collection, especially since the widescreen version has been available before.",1490054400,2,1619,4.598615916955017

8254142,5,B00142UZ3A,"I was online looking for a movie that I hadn't seen in years, Prom Night 2: Hello Mary Lou and Amazon just proved once more that you can find almost anything on Amazon!! I was just going to get the second movie but I saw this box set with the Original Prom Night with Jamie Lee Curtis, Prom Night 2; Hello Mary Lou, Prom Night 3: Last Kiss, Prom Night 4:Deliver us from Evil and the 2008 remake of Prom Night which I didn't know was in it. While it is true that the the 2nd, 3rd and 4th really have nothing to do with the original movie the 4th(which I had never seen and in fact didn't know there was one) as less to do with the original than the 2nd and 3rd one do, it was really dumb!! But It was just really awesome to see these movies again and to get them at such a great price, also it said that I wasn't going to get it till like 13th of March and I received it on Saturday Feb. 23 so Way To go, exstreamly Happy.",1361664000,5,921,3.878306878306878
8254143,4,B00142UZ3A,"Prom Night, one of the keystones in the Slasher sub genre, came out direct from Canada and took the movie going public by storm.  As all things in a horror movie, three sequels and a remake soon followed.  Combining all these very different installments in one convient collection, this box set is a terrific space saver for any Prom Night fan.  Just keep in mind that most of the movies here are transferred from a VHS print and not original vault materials which is the only reason I'm deducting a star.

Prom Night: Chapter One is a simple revenge story.  Four youngsters cause an accidental death of a classmate during a game of hide and seek.  As it would have it, six years later the senior Prom just happens to fall on the anniversary of the accident and now someone is out for revenge and the four kids responsible will get more then just the crown. Tonight maybe a night to remember, but for some it'll be a night to die for.  This movie may have flown under the radar had it not been for a strong performance by Scream Queen Jamie Lee Curtis in her post-Halloween fame.  The print itself is pretty bad.  It was taken from a PAL video so the music and sound have been sped up.  The screen is very dark and at times it difficult to clearly make out what is going on.  Those of you with Anchor Bay's OOP edition (the best one around, IMO) or even the later Echo Bridge edition (it's the one with Jamie Lee on the cover holding an ax in her bouquet) may want to hold on to your copies.

Hello Mary Lou, Prom Night 2:  This is the first sequel to drop the whole simple masked killer and go with a supernatural revenge story.  In 1957, Mary Lou Maloney was accidentally set on fire by a scorned lover and killed before she could be crowned Prom Queen.  Thirty years later, her old trunk is opened by plain Jane Vicki Carpenter and her spirit is unleashed.  Taking over Vicki's body and seeking out justice for her death are just a few things Mary Lou has to do before going to her prom.  While being a Carrie ripoff, Prom Night 2 is still a really fun sequel.  The print is pretty good except it too suffers from being really dark at times and the colors overall are a little washed out.  MGM finally released this sequel in a much more polished print and in widescreen as well so fans may want to either hold on to their copies or buy it flat out.

Prom Night 3: The Last Kiss proves you can't keep a bad ghoul down with Mary Lou escaping from Hell and returning to her favorite hunting grounds of Hamilton High.  This time around she takes a shinning to dorky med school hopeful Alex and even helps him get further ahead.  But when her methods prove to be a little extreme, Alex breaks it off with her all together.  Too bad there's that old saying Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.  This is the reason you want this set. Back when Artisan originally released this sequel, they released it in the form of a badly worn transfer.  And, much to the loathing of Prom Night fans, the print was edited for television.  This copy restores all the footage from the R-rated cut. The finger cutting is here as well as all the nudity.

Prom Night 4: Deliver Us From Evil ditches the supernatural element as well as the comedy scheme in favor of a more serious slasher installment.  1957 was a bad year for Hamilton High. Not only did it watch its Prom Queen go up like a Roman Candle but two more students were butchered by a crazed priest.  After he was caught and put away, he escapes 30 years later to the former monestery he once called home only to find its now a summer home being used by four teens for a private After Party.  It's a good thing he brought his tricked out crucifix knife to teach these filthy whores a lesson in the Wrath of God.  The print is pretty good except for a little color fading and it's the same transfer Artisan had used for theirs.

Prom Night (2008) totally forgets the whole series and goes with a simple stalker flick.  Three years ago, Donna witnessed her whole family murdered by an obsessed teacher.  Now, as she spends her Prom with her boyfriend and friends, she has no idea that her nightmare is about to return as her former teacher escapes from the mental ward and is now at the very hotel where the prom is being held.  The transfer is perfect and is in its original R-rated (our Unrated) form.

Make this a night to remember and get this set.  Personally, I wouldn't pay over $25 if you can help it.  I got mine off eBay.  Good luck if you go that route.",1359244800,3,4504,4.291469194312796
