8599559,5,B00DZTUX28,"The Witnesses interviewed by Mark lane in Rush To Judgment - and used practically verbatim by Oliver Stone in JFK - speak much louder than any other evidence subject to discussion and controversy over the years. Once you've heard their conviction of a shooter firing from behind the fence on the grassy knoll, there is no doubt of a conspiracy in the assassination of JFK. NONE.",1396656000,,378,4.742424242424242
8599560,5,B00DZTUX28,"Two films on dvd's showing the early days of JFK assassination research,they are...
1. Rush To Judgment.....Mark Lane takes you through his investigations with
  interviews from eye witnesses to the assassination. See Orville Nix say his film
  had frames missing when returned by the FBI,Ruby stalking Oswald,eye witnesses
  who were never called by the Warren Comm,how Dallas police were always given
  free booze by Ruby in his club and so much more. A ground breaking film released
  in 1967 with very good picture and sound quality considering it's age.
  I saw this film on British tv during the 80's and it inspired me to find other info
  about that day in Dallas. The information in this film is still valid today and should
  be seen by everyone who wants to find the truth about 22/11/1963.

2. New Revelations Twenty Years Later.....In this film you can see an interview with a
  member of the Warren Comm. who has doubts about the evidence presented to them.
  The backyard photos of Oswald deemed fake by a British expert,the part played by
  the Mob in the assassination,how the CIA had photos of another Oswald in Mexico.
  There are many interviews with pro Castro Cubans,anti Castro Cubans,FBI agents,
  former CIA  and many others who all have information about a crime committed by
  a Lone Nut a.k.a. Lee Harvey Oswald. The picture and sound quality are only fair
  but you forget that when the evidence is revealed.

  Overall an essential DVD for those wanting to see how the JFK Assassination was
  investigated by individuals and not the American Government in the early years.",1379203200,2,1602,4.865168539325842
8599561,5,B00DZTUX28,"I don't have this particular set, but I have seen these films and they do offer must-have evidence that the murder of JFK was a coup in the US.  It also interviews murdered witnesses who saw proof of a conspiracy during the the assassination.  I highly recommend these be seen to understand the full range of the conspiracy.",1375488000,4,324,4.568965517241379
