1759061,1,B00006HAYQ,"This has got to be the worst movie EVER!  The writer threw every cliche in the book into this plot and failed miserably.  The performances by Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan were adequate but they didn't stand a chance with the horrific writing and editing.  The premise was that two people meet in New York at The Plaza while planning their weddings to other people.  He is a cop on a leave of absence and she is a school teacher.  They apparently live in a suburb of NYC, so why would they both need to incur the expense of staying at The Plaza.  In one scene, Anna - the school teacher, goes into Bulgari of all places to buy a gift for her maid of honor.  What school district does she work for that she could afford to shop in Bulgari?  Also, there are several scenes with her maid of honor and his best man where both obviously live in NYC.  Why, again, would the two main characters stay at The Plaza when they have close friends and family that live in New York?  The side plot involving the maid of honor and the best man meeting in a bar was strange and had no purpose.  All in all this movie was so lame it made Duece Bigalow look like an Oscar nominated film!",1044144000,8,1177,4.209821428571429
1759062,5,B00006HAYQ,"I thought this was a throw back to the old days. I enjoyed being able to watch the film with my kids who are teenagers and my wife and not have to feel uncomfortable about the typical bathroom humor you find filmmakers lowering themselves to do inorder to get a cheap life. It was a touching little film, fun moments and it sent a nice message. Mostly what I enjoyed was the fact that even in a genre that has been done a thousand times the writer thought of a unique way to bring the two stars (Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan) back together at the end. If you are not a cynical person you will love this film ... if you are I suggest renting one of those teem movies that have toilet jokes, sight gags and charachters that don't exsist in real life.",1044144000,28,757,4.227586206896552
1759063,5,B00006HAYQ,"I saw this movie on the television and I just had to buy the DVD.  I am such a sucker for romantic movies like this because we all know that in real life, do you think such a thing will ever happen to all of us?  Anyway, this is the sort of movie which you want to watch over and over again with your girl friends and be in tears together.  Yes, I was in tears during that Central Park scene when she parted from him.  And... Michael Vartan....  I am totally in love with him.  A true romantic leading man!  Yes, this movie is predictable!  yes, it is corny!  Yes, it is such a fairy tale but you still have to watch it!!! it will just melt your heart away. This movie is up there in my list of romantic movies like Four Weddings, While you were sleeping & Jerry Maguire.",1040601600,8,771,4.019736842105263
1759064,5,B00006HAYQ,"this movie may be pradictoble, and chessy bu it had the fine michle vaungh- i mean vartan who is in the show i am OBSESSED with, so it was soooooooooo worth it!",1038268800,4,160,4.03125
1759065,4,B00006HAYQ,"This is the second film I've seen where Vartan is the leading man. He again completely delivers and is probably this film's greatest joy.  The plot is nothing earth shattering but it is a good vehicle for him.  He checks into a hotel to plan his wedding and meets a woman who is there to do the same.  Problem is that they are both scheduled to marry two rich but total sharks in the corporate world.  She is a teacher and he is a policeman on leave of absence for a failed hostage negotiation.  So they are really not in synch with their intendeds.  Thus, they start falling in love with one another as they plan to wed these two other people.  There is also a cute supporting role couple, the best friends of each of the leads.  I really enjoyed it.

1759066,4,B00006HAYQ,"The plot is formulaic, the dialogue is cheesy, almost cringe-inducing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I'd definitely class it as a ""chick flick"" but one that men won't mind seeing either.",1034985600,,194,5.0625
1759067,4,B00006HAYQ,"Michael Vartan, (not Joseph Baldwin as stated in the other review), is excellent in this film. OK so it is a chick flick but get the girls round, open a bottle of wine, sit back and enjoy the man that is Michael.",1033948800,3,212,4.071428571428571

1759095,3,B00006HAYQ,"Four conflict lost romantics in the cynical big city! Super cool premise: two fianc&eacute;s of other planned spouse shop around two for wedding accoutrements. Natasha and Michael stay at the same hotel - the real Plaza! Olivia and Michael R. are would be fiances who meet up in local ginmill.
Natasha is excellent, with her exotic smile and her statuesque frame. She's a grammar school Teacher. Michael is an ex NY cop who quit and turned to writing. With the downbeat personality of the character, one can see why he would be frustrated in the previous role. His acting is flatter than a pancake. One would think he was law enforcement in Mayberry not the Big Apple.
His buddy is Michael Rispoli, the real deal, part Pacino, part Chris Farley. a raging alchoholic, he still manages to stick to the job. OLivia is his *love*...anyway they met once in the abovementioned bar....
(look for ex Del-Ron Lorraine Mazzola in a small role as a upscale wedding planner!).

Movie actually a nice flow for about the first half, then begins the long drag to the end. Too much self analysis and blah, blah, blah.
Get it for many pleasant moments in a real life location...and for Natasha. She's fabulous.",1437868800,,1193,4.735576923076923

1759146,4,B00006HAYQ,"I really enjoyed the story, but there were a couple of spots that seemed really silly. The more I thought about it the more I wanted to believe that the part where the couple went to check out a band for Charlie's wedding was necessary. It showed that the two of them could enjoy something so stupid whereas that probably would never have happened with the people they both were engeged to. Also, the part where Charlie recognized the man on the street who had fallen on hard times and Charlies could still take time to stop and speak to this man. It would have shown Ana that Charlie had real character and concern for other people, as he did in his position as a law enforcement officer.",1382140800,,689,4.390625

1759150,4,B00006HAYQ,Vartan is the prince of romance. His presence made Alias one of my favorite TV shows and this movie one of my favorites. It is old-fashioned in the sense that it is non-explicit but it's cute and enjoyable. Vartan is just always convincing as the lead in a romance.,1378339200,,265,4.428571428571429
1759151,1,B00006HAYQ,"Maybe I had high expectations for this movie, but it was extremely boring. The story was unrealistic, the characters did not have chemistry, and the story line was slow-moving. The cover even has Natasha Henstridge with long hair and in the actual movie it's short! I won't ruin the movie for you, but skip it.",1377561600,,310,4.654545454545454
1759152,4,B00006HAYQ,"In spite of being a bit too subdued in spots, this movie has a good premise and does it in a tasteful way. The idea is that an ex-cop who lives with a successful publisher has to go to NY alone to start wedding plans while his fiancee is off in Europe. While there, he accidentally bumps into a good-looking woman who is essentially in the same situation. They end up striking up a friendship as they go to different locations to make plans together. While they have an obvious attraction, they they keep it clean and don't really cheat on their fiancees, even though doubts start creeping in about their upcoming weddings as they find they have a lot in common. Not to spoil the ending let me just say that it turns out happily without any ugly things happening to the fiancees. The actors do a good job in this movie and create likable characters although in some cases, they are so reserved that it takes a bit of air out of the plot. This isn't a classic romantic comedy but it is serviceable and provides for a nice viewing experience.",1374624000,,1040,4.393782383419689

It's about a man and a woman who are planning their separate weddings (their partners are too busy).  They meet and fall in love.

I was not very happy with the condition of the DVD.  It was very dirty, like if someone ate something greasy before they handled it.  It was all scratched up.  The only reason I'm keeping it is because it cost me only $1 and it works.  But, I have bought dvds for $0.98 that were in mint condition.

  In addition to these two scenes, Charlie's best friend is an alcoholic, who says he spends almost every night at a bar (he announces he is sober by the end of the movie)and there are many scenes where alcohol is consumed, both at bars and restaurants.
  There are also times of saying the Lord's name in vain- I cannot recall if there is any swearing though. There are other references to sex (beyond the first item mentioned).
  Finally, near the end of the movie there is a scene which might be scary for children- it is of a young girl on the ledge of a building who is contemplating suicide because her parents are divorcing. She does not go through with it though because Charlie talks her out of it.",1280275200,5,1031,4.428571428571429

1759185,5,B00006HAYQ,"I've read thousands of books and seen hundreds maybe even over a thousand movies.  There are classics to be sure, but only a few basic plots, most of which surprise us only when we're very young and just starting life's journey.  (Everything else is a twist or variation on one of life's themes and plots.) I know which books and movies are classics for me. This one is not a classic but a variation, but it's TOTALLY enjoyable.

I've gotten to the age where reading is more problematical than watching movies, so I choose the latter. Something I've observed is that restrained behavior, as that between our hero and heroine, can be just as exciting and satisfying, perhaps more so, as actual physical, explicit lovemaking, which incidentally is usually done rather poorly on screen because most of the time actors are faking it.  I don't find restraint in this film to be a fault.

So much takes place in the minds and hearts of the characters in this film ... but, even in one weekend, one can see signs on the faces of the lead actors that things are happening with this couple that lead to an outcome neither had intended in the beginning.  Doubts about their impending marriages were already there, but it took a chance meeting to begin to bring those doubts to the fore.  Hesitancy, shyness, fear of rejection or something else resulted in their not getting in touch with each other for a year.  So what if the circumstance that ultimately brings them together is sort of predictable, their reunion is still wonderfully sweet and real.

These are actors who use their craft to work from their interior beings, emotions and thoughts, to express what is inside in a visible yet subtle way.  They do not go over the top, constantly overacting, overdoing, which is one way of acting quite prevalent today, perhaps because the teenage public (the majority of moviegoers, so I'm told) want that kind of drama or comedy.  Who among us has ever experienced something like ""The Wedding Crashers,"" a way-over-the-top film if there ever was one?

I liked ""It Had to Be You"" because it was warm, sweet, funny, perhaps even because it was predictable in its ultimate outcome (maybe because chance has played such a large part in friendships and love in my own life).

I had never seen Michael Vartan before and was very impressed with how he made the most of the slightly pedestrian script ... genuine, sincere, restrained, seemingly at the beginning not so much a man in love as one resigned to the course of events to which he was committed.  Natasha Henstridge had even a more difficult character to portray ... someone who at the beginning is a constricted person who has yet to know herself, is waiting to come out as the funny, fun-loving person she really is.  That part of herself begins to emerge in the two days she and Michael Vartan's character spend together.  He realizes fully how he feels about her and cancels his plans, but she cancels her plans without quite knowing what she feels toward him. At the end and after a year there is a catalyst that does what any good literary catalyst does (I won't spoil this for those who don't want to know the ending before they see it on screen).

This is an entertaining film, not a deliberate attempt at making a movie classic.  It can be enjoyed in the company of any member of the family of any age who can forego a preference for horror, sci-fi and fantasy for an hour and a half.  Perhaps it could have been better if the production values of a high budget film had been applied.  But there would be, even then, professional critics, even some of our other part-time opinionators, who tell us of its shortcomings.  I prefer to be influenced by my fellow movie watchers who have enjoyed something ... because I'm one of them, and though my tastes can be just as refined and highbrow as anyone else's at times, I love both mashed potatoes and Lyonnaise potatoes.",1202947200,11,3915,4.620490620490621

1759201,3,B00006HAYQ,"While I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, the script for this film plods and the story is so predictable that it actually was a bit tedious.  That's not to say that the romantic aspects of the film aren't also enjoyable, because I did enjoy the film -- it just took me about 5 times to sit through the DVD.  Michael Vartan from the Alias TV series fame has been in several romantic comedies like ""Never Been Kissed"" (1999) & ""Monster-in-Law"" w/ Jane Fonda & Jennifer Lopez (2005).  Vartan is an interesting actor.  Born in Paris, he began his early film career in French-speaking films.  He has a charming boyish sincerity that plays well, even in this DVD.  Natasha Henstridge came to attention in the Species series where she played in all three of those movies as well as in ""The Whole Ten Yards"" & ""Bounce.""  The plot is predictable with the two fiancees each planning their weddings solo & then discovering that they've fallen in love.  Olivia d'Abo, who is the daughter of Michael a'Abo from the rock band Manfred Mann, plays Vartan's wealthy fiancee that eventually gets dumped.  The coincidences in the movie are a bit too numerous, pointing like neon signs to the ending where Vartan's Charlie Hudson & Henstridge's Anna Penn fall in love.  This is a nice evening's entertainment, particularly if you really enjoy the romantic comedy genre.  While Vartan & Henstridge do well enough, they still can't surmount the material.  Enjoy!",1172016000,18,1439,4.804878048780488

1759203,4,B00006HAYQ,"I read all the reviews of this movie before writing mine. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I've watched it at least 50 times and it makes me cry each time. I know, I'm a hopeless romatic and probably a total fool, but this movie is so sweet. I think Michael Vartan (!!) and Natasha Henstridge have chemistry that works in this movie. I also like the subplot of Henry and Tracy and them not knowing their best friends are the ones who are getting married to people they are not suited for. Maybe the writing and editing are poor, I'm not educated to comment in that area, but the movie is funny in many parts, depicting typical New York snobs such as the salesperson at Bulgari. The fact that they fall in love during the weekend they are both planning their weddings to other people is a fun twist. They do ""the right thing"" by not being together until they break up with their respective intendeds. Unlike most real life. Maybe love at first sight isn't smart or lasting or whatever, but remember - IT'S A MOVIE! It's for entertainment value, and I feel entertained each time I watch it. I like the music and wish I could find the soundtrack to buy. I have watched this movie with two of my guy friends, and both of them cried, although not as much as I did. The part that always gets me is at the end when they are in the park, pretending to fly to Europe and then she says she can't do it. Notice the look on Michael's face as the camera fades away...then the song...""have you ever loved somebody so much it made you cry?"" Yes, I have. Yes, I do. Enjoy this movie for what it is, fun, romantic, with a (thankfully) happy ending.",1152748800,74,1617,4.270358306188925
1759204,4,B00006HAYQ,"This is really not a bad movie. True, the script isn't the greatest thing and it is predictable, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. The plot is interesting, the situation is heartbreaking and the acting is pretty good. The problem this film has is that it is both a chick flick and a drama and it can't seem to decide which it wants to be. If you think you can live with that, then I recommend it. If you don't, then don't buy it. All you basically need to know about the plot is that two people, Anna and Charlie, meet the weekend they are both planning their weddings and they fall in love. And, of course, we all know what happens at the end, but all in all, it is still a pretty romantic movie.",1100131200,15,701,4.086956521739131
1759205,1,B00006HAYQ,"After becoming Michael Vartan's devoted fan, I began looking for any films which would enable me to receive a dose of visual stimulation. Luckily I have Alias to fall back on to erase the filthy residue this horrible movie has left on Vartan's image. I completely agree with one of the viewers who mentioned that the movie is composed of a flimsy and predictable plot and a very sour dialogue. The characters were painfully one-dimensional. The Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf have more chemistry than Vartan and Natasha. Most of the time my skin crawled at the cheesy moments and fake displays of emotions. I was embarrassed for the director and the actors and wished that some force would  save it somehow but to no avail, it just plummeted with a nasty squeal.

There are plenty of horrible romantic comedies, as well as really delicious ones. The pitiful thing is that movies like this atrocity give chick flicks such a bad reputation. ""Roman Holiday"" was a great romantic film which transcended genders, men and women equally enjoyed the magical film, great acting, engaging plot, juicy dialogue and intense chemistry. But then movies such as this one come along, and anyone with a craving for something magical just rejects the possibility of a romantic content with style. The only consolation was Vartan's good looks for an hour. However if that is your goal watch the 3 seasons of Alias, he's a lot more fun to watch and to listen to. Stay away from this terrible movie, lifetime channel offers similarly idiotic movies for free.",1099180800,8,1550,4.801498127340824

To be honest I was quite disappointed in this movie.  The script is so old and has nothing new to offer.  The only redeeming quality was Micheal Vartan and even he couldn't carry this movie.  He had nothing to play off of and it clearly showed since the movie went straight to video... So I would say skip it, unless you are a huge, I mean HUGE fan of Michael Vartan and just want to see him for an hour an half.",1076198400,13,538,4.047169811320755
