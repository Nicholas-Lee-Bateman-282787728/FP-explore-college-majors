8463768,3,B005AZHQJI,"Known in its native Germany as 'der Hexer,' 1964's 'The Ringer' is a fun little mystery based upon the book by prolific British writer Edgar Wallace ('King Kong,' 'The Door with Seven Locks') and stylishly directed by (West) German Alfred Vorher ('Dead Eyes of London,' 'The Zombie Walks'), who helmed several campy Wallace adaptations (a.k.a. 'Krimis') during the '60s.  The story, set in England, involving murder, a white-slavery ring, an unidentified avenger and, of course, Scotland Yard's finest, is suitably convoluted and often is played for laughs, though not to the point of distraction.  It's also loaded with quirky characters, rich sets complete with secret doors and booby traps, and lots of curvy dames and harmless sexual innuendo (think Bond films of the period).  The crisp black-and-white cinematography shows rather well on this disc, presented in widescreen, with only a few defects and some infrequent ghosting evident.  Be warned, however, of two things:  1) the Video Dimensions release is a DVD-R, a format which may not be compatible with all players; and 2) this is an English-dubbed version, and both the translated script and the voiceover talent are about as bad as it gets (the good news is this actually heightens the camp factor, if you're receptive to it).  A handful of Wallace/Vorher movie trailers constitute the extra features.  Film earns 3 1/2 stars, downgraded a tad for the DVD-R and overdubbing issues.",1336867200,7,1445,5.175965665236052
