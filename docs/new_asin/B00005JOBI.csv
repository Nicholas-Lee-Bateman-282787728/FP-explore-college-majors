Michel Piccoli is at the peak of his considerable acting powers as the domineering older brother, with Anouk Aimee as his  sister.  The bond between them has always been based on the idea that she is emotionally so fragile, so barely able to function in the world, that he must take care of her in the way that you would a disabled family member.

In fact, his existence is so wrapped up in this caretaker role that when a new nurse, hired to help with his sister, announces that she and his sister are going on an outing -- a trip to the shore -- he tries to put a stop to it with an alarming vehemence.  Eventually his sister has her way, and it leaves her brother so lost, so absolutely unable to figure out what to do with himself in her absence, that he takes his own life within minutes of her departure.

The final shot of the film, in one continuous take, is so daring, so psychologically compelling and so stunning, I've never forgotten it.  Let's hope a DVD release is coming!",1194048000,,1077,4.301980198019802
