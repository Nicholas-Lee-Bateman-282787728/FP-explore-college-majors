2417530,4,B000BITUES,"The information in the documentaries is very interesting. However, Mr. Burns adds some
of his own oppinions to each documentary that are not relevant to the history of the
subject. An example is The Statue of Liberty documentary has comments about
slavery in it.",1358121600,,262,4.9772727272727275
2417531,5,B000BITUES,"Like ""The Civil War"" and ""Baseball,"" the documentaries in this set resonate with a sense of history only a documentarian sensitive to the reflection of the past upon the present can bring to his prjects.  The story of the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is a moving tribute to the sacrifices never thought of when traversing that singular achievement is alone worth the investment.  These are the kinds of presentation that inspire further investigation and learning.  This is a set worth having.",1356134400,10,500,5.073170731707317
2417532,5,B000BITUES,"""The Shakers"" has to be about the best, high-quality documentary one could ever hope for.  The Shakers interviewed are engaging and warm to the max.  The shots of Shaker buildings are nothing but breathtaking.  I tend to think that, were I not Roman Catholic, I would have checked out this wonderful society.",1335571200,5,308,4.884615384615385

2417534,5,B000BITUES,"The photography, the honesty and the dialog are simply excellent.

I watched it over a 3 day period and then watched it again.

I loaned it to a home school situation that kept if for a month.  They passed it around and I ended up losing two of the disks.  Who knows - no one offered to replace them.

It is a great set.  AS soon as I get over being angry, I need to order another set!",1286841600,14,385,3.871794871794872

2417537,4,B000BITUES,"This Huey Long documentary is one of Ken Burns' early films before the success of The Civil War.  Back then Burns stayed on the straight narrative instead of turning his stories into polemics on race.  This one gives a clear picture of the rise and fall of a megalomaniacal power hungry politician who used the fears of the poor in Louisiana to build a dictatorial empire in the state. Like a character in a Greek play his hubris made him go too far until a single unknown citizen, related to a politician Long was attempting to destroy, assassinated him. If you're interested in the story of Huey Long this is the documentary to watch prior to viewing the great film All The King's Men or reading the novel by Robert Penn Warren.",1461715200,,730,4.5227272727272725

2417547,5,B000BITUES,"As an engineer I really appreciated this video on the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. It really is an engineering marvel.  It was a struggle to build the structure without the modern tools we have now. The head engineer who designed the bridge had an interesting history as well. Really well done.

At any rate, I'm sure there were no dinosaurs living in the United States during the time the United States has been the United States.

The film provide a great deal of history and insight into the evolution of the electronics industry and consumer entertainment from the earliest radios to the advent of television.  There are many other contributors to the evolution of radio but Ken Burns zeroed in on the three men who were most responsible for developing the technology and the demand for technology by the public.  5 Stars.,1426464000,5,456,4.973684210526316

There was some interest in the construction, but few illustrations. About half of the program was mostly interviews with folks who simply appreciated the beauty of the bridge.

2417688,5,B000BITUES,As always  Ken Burns does a great job of making history interesting. I had the chance to meet Ken Burns last month and he talked about his first film Which was the Brooklin Bridge. He did not invision the long series of films that he has come to make. Watch it and see his earlest work and then watch his current work. Many things are the same and many thingshave changed or developed,1418947200,,384,4.260273972602739

2417691,5,B000BITUES,"I used this as a Movie Review selection for my Louisiana History college course. The other choices were both versions of ""All the King's Men"" which didn't interest me as they were fiction. My movie review got me a grade of 100...Ken Burns did an amazing job! The intro was a HOOK, lol! Hipopalowrom and Lowpopahirom had me rolling! Seeing his sister talk about the 'log cabin' was priceless, and the collection of old Cajun people who defended him was just brilliant! Betty Dodd talking about everyone wanting to KILL him ""but of course nobody did...but we all wanted it to happen"" omg! Ken Burns made a history biography into almost a reality show gossipy-OMG show and even though he was forced to include some obligatory history facts, he counters them with jaw-dropping wth's all over the place! A documentary that will keep you AWAKE! This made me wish Huey was alive, even though he had obvious characteristics that could be construed as self-serving, he did more for the state, and even the country, and it was obvious that regardless of his ""tactics"" some of the people slammed, he dragged illiterate, impoverished Louisiana up out of a state of pity to a state of envy with our new roads, bridges, LSU teaching hospital, LSU's band, our new state capitol....what a powerhouse this man was! And even managed to take down huge corporations...no one else has ever been able to accomplish what he did, and Ken Burns made me wish he was here today, I'd rush to vote him in! His legacy is everywhere. I think he WAS a king, and the comparison to Hitler and Mussolini and Caesar, well...he did care about the poor and he didn't just make empty promises, he DID something about it. I think he would have been a fabulous President and the country would have been better off. Sorry for rambling, this documentary is obviously worth watching, if it's making someone young care this much about him and what he did (I'm a college student) :)",1416960000,11,1936,4.680351906158358

2417705,4,B000BITUES,"There's very little that I can say negatively about Ken Burns.  I believe that he is the de facto American historian laureate, and it is clear that many years from now, the repository of his work will continue to enlighten, entertain and inform viewers for many years to come.  In this series, which contains some of his earliest works, we see the Burns Style in development.  His early style is personalistic, his aim is to not only tell history but to delve into the personalities of the people who made history and were effected by it.  From very early on, he collaborated with David McCollough, whose style is similar, and was possibly an influence on the then-young cinematographer.
  My criticisms are few: the treatment of the Brooklyn Bridge is in my opinion half-history and half schtick, the second part taken up with the portrayal of the Bridge in art and movies, with a cameo appearance by of all characters Bugs Bunny.  It contrasts as rather lightweight in comparison to the ""Civil War"" or 'The Roosevelts.""  The rest of the series, though I may not have picked the same topics, was comprehensive and highly satisfying.  The series is in standard definition, and the films looks their age, with a 'patina' that suggests age.",1416528000,,1238,4.80188679245283

2417708,5,B000BITUES,"As am amateur student of Louisiana history and having recently read several books on Huey Long, I found the program fascinating. As Long's son pointed out, Huey gave the people what they wanted but the confusion as to his status as a dictator is because people confuse the mechanics of a democracy with the spirit of a democracy. The people got what they needed and wanted without the proper form of obtaining it. The legislative process was bypassed. Burns covered many aspects of HPL's life and of his death. I did object to him referring to Dr. Carl Weiss as the assassin. There is to this day uncertainty and a lack of physical evidence to say that Carl Weiss was the shooter. A good sequel to this program would be to research how Long's legacy to this day has a large influence on the politics of Louisiana and how FDR's policies were modified in order to blunt Huey's impact on national politics.",1415923200,,903,4.580246913580247

2417737,5,B000BITUES,"Seeing ""Ken Burns"" in the title is a red flag for me indicating genius.  His use of historical documents and photos, pertinent interviews and professional actors used for the voice work, lead to masterful work.

2417756,2,B000BITUES,"While I'm a great fan of Ken Burns, I must report that this series is most disappointing.  I'm not exactly sure what the problem is, but in the ""Shakers"" episode, for example, at least half the time of the episode is a series of ravishing countrysides in his characteristic zoom and pan.  The problem is these are empty buildings and scenery  and there's relatively little about the Shakers themselves.  It felt like he could tell the story of the Shakers in about 15 minutes and all the ravishing countrysides are just filler.  As his recent ""Roosevelt"" series shows, he can do much, much better that this.",1412380800,,607,4.688679245283019

2417869,5,B000BITUES,"Viewing 'America' in its entirety confirms that Ken Burns was the right choice for the 2013 John Steinbeck Humanitarian Award, given to Burns last week in San Jose, CA. Bravo for three decades of American achievement!",1387497600,,217,5.055555555555555

2417872,5,B000BITUES,"Ken Burns is amazing. He has given us so much and has so much more to give us, I'm sure. I watched the segment about the building of the Brooklyn Bridge. I was captured by the story, the engineering , and the people involved. The bridge is indeed an icon and I am proud to come from the city that calls it home. I highly recommend this series.",1385510400,,343,4.0588235294117645

2417876,5,B000BITUES,"The title is a little strange even though each film in the series is about America and Americans.  It is more a compilation of six of his documentaries thrown into one series and it had to be named something!  Beside that, each film is another Burns masterpiece and cover a decade of his work from 1982 - 1992 and you can see his work progressively improving with each documentary. The film on The Congress should be mandatory viewing in our school systems!",1382400000,,457,4.560975609756097
2417877,5,B000BITUES,Great documentary about America. I love history anyway. I learned things I didn't know about the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge.,1381449600,,139,5.086956521739131

2417901,4,B000BITUES,Very dense and really went into the history of the three men who pioneered the radio back in the day.,1379980800,,101,4.1
2417902,5,B000BITUES,Ken Burns has revolutionized documentary filmmaking. Ken  Burns America is a great collection of several diverse topics that define aspects of America and allow you to take part in history. I love it.,1379808000,,200,5.0606060606060606

2417904,5,B000BITUES,"This is another in a long line of extremely well done documentaries by Ken Burns. I learned, and was entertained at the same time. Highly recommended !",1378252800,,151,4.62962962962963
2417905,5,B000BITUES,"This series is easily watched, as it covers a single unique facet of Americana in each episode. Most of these intriguing bits of history were either not at all covered in school, or were covered in a much less interesting manner. Burns makes it clear - truth truly is stranger than fiction. Great storytelling, and great perspective on why we must never take out amazing country for granted.",1377129600,,391,4.764705882352941
2417906,5,B000BITUES,"The films that make up the 'America' series by Ken Burns are nothing short of brilliant ... There isn't a film maker today who comes close to comparing to what Ken Burns' films bring to their audience, documentary or otherwise...",1375142400,,229,4.75
2417907,5,B000BITUES,"We watched this before a visit to Brooklyn, and it was a great introduction to the years of hard and very dangerous work of building the Brooklyn Bridge. It is also a reminder of a different time in America, when we were building the best infrastructure in the world.",1373500800,,267,4.469387755102041
2417908,4,B000BITUES,In depth history and presentation on some of the most relevant elements of America and being an American. A great time spent for all ages and backgrounds.,1371945600,,154,4.7407407407407405
2417909,4,B000BITUES,"All of the sujects are interesting but, for me, it was worth buy just for the Huey Long biography, which is wonderful.",1369785600,,118,4.409090909090909
2417929,5,B000BITUES,"This collection is a must have for any fan of Burns' epic documentaries ""The Civil War"", ""Baseball"" and ""Jazz"".  This is a collection of his earlier works made in 1982 - 1992. Both ""The Brookline Bridge"" and ""Statue of Liberty"" are great viewings prior to a trip to NYC. In true Burns style, they are meticulously researched with great images to keep it interesting. Burns has a knack of showing the appropriate image or film clip at just the right moment in the narration.

Having been made almost 30 years ago, these documentaries are not as technologically sophisticated as his more recent work but that adds to the charm and creates some great archival expert commentary. In ""The Brookline Bridge"", for example, there are comments from a very young David McCullough and the late Lewis Mumford.",1367107200,,797,4.852941176470588
2417930,5,B000BITUES,I would watch anything produced by Ken Burns. In-depth and entertaining. Enlightening and uplifting. Watch it. It beats mindless TV like a drum.,1366416000,,144,5.304347826086956
2417931,5,B000BITUES,"Another great documentary by Ken Burns. It was all very interesting subjects, and kept my attention. Its definitely worth watching.",1364515200,,131,5.6
2417932,4,B000BITUES,"While not all topics are as riveting as those covered in his early series' he remains a great documentary filmmaker. The topics shed light on lesser-known areas of American history, such as the building of the Brooklyn bridge and installing the Statue of Liberty.

I'm always better for having watched a Ken Burns film.",1364515200,,319,4.907407407407407
2417933,3,B000BITUES,Repeats too much within the program.  Too  much useless filler.  Subject is very interesting but it is a yawner.  Save your money,1363392000,,129,4.7272727272727275
2417934,4,B000BITUES,"I like movies of Ken Burns. I am an immigrant and these narratives were discovering for me the many sides of American History.
Thank you",1362700800,,136,4.48
2417935,4,B000BITUES,"The Huey Long film is excellent, worth the purchase price alone.  Empire of the Air is a fascinating study of broadcasting pioneers who are laregly forgotten now.  The Shaker film is quaint.  Brooklyn Bridge is vintage Ken Burns and the Statue of Liberty film is ok.  Thomas Hart Benton's biography is interesting, but not really to my taste.  The Congress film is intersting to a point, but tries to cover too broad a subject---too many years, too many personalities---to really do any of them justice.  It would have made a good mini-series.",1360108800,,543,4.8478260869565215
2417936,4,B000BITUES,"I showed this to my high school students and while I enjoyed it and the documentary was excellent, it was pretty slow and boring for teenagers.  I don't recommend it for schools.  It is a history of Congress, not as much an overview of how Congress works.  If you want to learn about the most powerful branch of government, you will certainly do that by watching this video.",1359590400,,374,4.470588235294118
2417937,5,B000BITUES,"I am only reviewing the one episode called Empire of the Air.  That is the only one I bought in this series so far.  It was a great episode on the inventors and entrepeneurs of radio when it was first getting off of the ground.  It focused on three people in particular.  If you want more history on the early days of radio I recommend reading the book called ""Hello Everybody! The Dawn of American Radio!""  The documentary and book compliment each other without duplicating information.

What makes Empire of the Air so good is that we hear and read quite a bit about the ""Golden Age of Radio"" which covers mostly the 1940s-50s, but we don't hear much about radio starting up in it's infancy and all of the guess work among the early radio pioneers as to how this medium would be used.  Anyway, I have yet to see a bad Ken Burns documentary.  They are always 5 stars!!!",1358985600,3,870,4.3602484472049685
2417938,5,B000BITUES,"After watching Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" I turned to this 1990 breakthrough masterpiece to try and better understand the tragedy that ultimately redefined the substance of our country. The Civil War was a shocking, horrifying undulation that touched every life on American soil and redefined the struggle for equality worldwide that has never been equaled in its prevail. As national treasure, historian Shelby Foote, explained in episode after episode, this war simply remade us. Ultimately, it changed us profoundly. Prior to the War, politicians referred to the collection of territories, by saying the United States ARE. Post-War, with the union reunited, the rhetoric changed to the United States IS.
Something to remember right here, right now.",1358726400,,746,5.552631578947368
8086998,2,B000BITUES,"Love Ken Burns, but this is the weakest series he's done.  I think.  In any case, this is not ""America"".  Heck, the ""Shakers"" have nothing to do with America.  It's a cult.  You can safely skip this one.  Sorry Ken, but you missed on this one.",1526083200,,243,4.173913043478261
8086999,3,B000BITUES,"You lost me at Jefferson had no malanto children. Not only was this well documented at the time but, by Sally's DNA along with her descendants, has revealed those children he kept in the basement were his. I enjoy PBS but, Be Frank.",1516492800,,232,4.4186046511627906

8087005,5,B000BITUES,"Nobody does American history like Ken Burns, and these seven documentaries are more evidence for that. My favorite is Empire of the Air.  A history of radio in America. The idea of invisible waves traveling for miles through the air, bringing the news or a symphony orchestra through an electronic box on my tabletop and then out into the living room as sound? It still has a mystical quality to it, these hundred years later.",1481241600,2,426,4.68
