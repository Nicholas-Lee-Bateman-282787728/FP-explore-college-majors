8684666,5,B00ORNW0F4,"I watched the original and these must be even better, what an AMAZING series...  I watched this series with my wife.  By disk three we were pulled in so deeply we watched these non-stop and we were swept away.  We watched these with the English subtitles,  I'd watch these over and over, even in the so called, poorly master editions from the 80's (I have a 4K up-conversion player and am watching on a 4K screen) but these new digitized editions would be spectacular.

We watched the Krishna series as well.  We've watched that series several times and have absolutely loved it each time.  The subtitles in English keep you with the story but the music and acting in these series is absolutely phenomenal.  Some scene draw energy from the stage and these are not a waste of time like the 100 million dollar ethical and moral failures.  We loved these so much we just bought the Shirdi Sai Baba Series as well.",1500076800,4,910,4.533742331288344
