Filmed in the summer of 1998, in the streets of Miami's tough Liberty City section, this documentary tells the story of three innocent young people who were victims of shootings and explores the resulting grief and crisis experienced by the community. A co-production of Court TV and the Miami-based Television News Group, the program was written, directed, and produced by Rob Feldman. ~ Alice Duncan, All Movie Guide",1104019200,,603,5.494623655913978
