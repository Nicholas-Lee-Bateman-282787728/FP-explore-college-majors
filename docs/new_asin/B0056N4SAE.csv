8459790,5,B0056N4SAE,Incredible film. Inventively made. It drew me into the world of people and is done in such a cinematic way it's hard to believe the voices are real. I have never seen anything like this.,1514678400,,186,4.3428571428571425

8459794,4,B0056N4SAE,A unique way to document a story about damaged people.  The director uses various techniques to tell the story of the young playwright.  It can be hard to watch because of the story but it's original and seems to capture the characters successfully.,1417564800,,249,4.767441860465116
8459795,4,B0056N4SAE,"I admit I didn't know much about Andrea Dunbar before this; I watched it because of reviews and award-recognition. It's certainly powerful and disturbing, and all involved do not hesitate to show life as it is, in a most dismal and unforgiving locale. It's a very clever format, using Dunbar's words and experience to portray life on the ass-edge of the UK.

""The Arbor"" is often hard to watch, and I admire it for the unflinching grit portrayed by actors and director. We have a situation that is prevalent in an area of the UK that has produced many artistic prodigies, but none as simple and unassuming as Ms. Dunbar. The differences among the 3 daughters are well defined, and I can't imagine how their bleak existence could be more powerfully displayed.

Not pleasant, but definitely worth a look. The artistry is definitely complete and intact. I watched this last weekend, and it still resonates. A lesson for those who think they're at wit's end: Write a play.",1350950400,,968,4.755952380952381
8459796,3,B0056N4SAE,"Interesting. Certainly an unusual way to make a film and it works surprisingly well but, really, I wasn't all that engaged most of the time. The scenes from the play ""The Arbor"" performed in the park were pretty cool, though.",1323820800,2,225,4.65
8459797,5,B0056N4SAE,"This tells the life story of UK playwright Andrea Dunbar, who was
discovered at a very young age in the British housing projects known as
'The Arbor' where she wrote about the alcoholism and family decay she
watched around her.

The film uses two extraordinary devices, both of which I found
off-putting at first, but had great impact by the end.

First, scenes from Dunbar's plays are staged in the open lawn areas of
the real life Arbor, so we see a fight taking place in a living room at
night acted out on the grass in broad daylight (with a couch and other
living room props sitting there surreally, watched by - presumably -
the neighborhood people still struggling under the same conditions. At
first this just seemed distracting, but over time, it helped bring home
that Dunbar's works represented real people, real lives, real pain.

The second, even odder and more audacious move, is to have all the
interviews with the real participants acted out by professional actors
lip-syncing to the recorded words of the real people. Again, the was
distracting for the first while, but eventually it lead to the film
feeling simultaneously dreamy and like a memory, and in some way more
'real' than if the actors simply used their own voices.

A very moving film that doesn't always work, but his heroic enough in
it's bravery that it more than overcomes the occasional missed step.",1318896000,3,1383,4.75
