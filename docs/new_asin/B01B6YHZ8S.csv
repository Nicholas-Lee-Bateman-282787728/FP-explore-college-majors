8749477,5,B01B6YHZ8S,"Obviously, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just think a minute, those of you who castigate this film and its direction. Let's place the blame where it belongs, on the ""Hollywood Suits,"" as they call the big shot executives who really control how a film will appear in its final version. Johnson, Gardener, and Borgarde all made an emotional and artistic commitment to this film at its inception. This is obvious to anyone with even a touch of cinematic sensitivity when viewing the film. The underappreciated Ava Gardner, Dirk Bogarde, and director Johnson were forced to reshoot many of the scenes, which made Gardner livid. The powers-that-be insisted that she come across as a Hollywood sexpot, rather than as the earthy prostitute who clearly experiences a spiritual epiphany after falling in love with the disillusioned priest character played by Bogarde. The film portrays souls in crisis, not your typical Hollywood garbage depending on sexually provocative women and shallow men to create the usual clichs",1479600000,3,1019,5.144578313253012
8749478,3,B01B6YHZ8S,"the script is too badly written for the talent to make a believable sense for us to care.  it is difficult to not care for the talent of ava gardner, dirk bogart, joseph cotton, etc. but the director managed",1477440000,2,207,4.3076923076923075
8749479,5,B01B6YHZ8S,"I love Ava Gardner, but this pro Fascist film has to be fast forwarded whenever the sympathies of the screenplay writer invade it.

Ava is great as is Bogarde..beauty overcomes this beast of a script.",1472083200,3,200,4.714285714285714
8749480,3,B01B6YHZ8S,"According to Dirk Bogarde's memoirs, he was an emergency replacement for Montgomery Clift and Clift may have been the lucky one. As handsome as Giuseppe Rotunno's photography and Nunnally Johnson's direction are, neither they nor the combined talents of Ava Gardner and Bogarde are enough to lift Johnson's anti-Communist/wannabe-inspirational script out of its own fulsomeness. As Bogarde recollects it, Johnson started out filming in the deglamorized style of Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio DeSica (and DeSica has a meaty supporting role here) but MGM blew a gasket after seeing the rushes and ordered four weeks' worth of material re-shot. Out went Gardner's torn stockings and in came the Sidney Guilaroff hairdos. Gardner and Bogarde were poleaxed but they finished the film like professionals. Also along for the ride, as a one-eyed foreign correspondent, is Joseph Cotten, in a role that contains a nod to ""Citizen Kane."" (""What do you want me to do? Invent a war?"") The B&W cinematography has a gray haze that I don't recall from Turner Classic Movies airings but that's a small consideration in a DVD that is mainly for Bogarde and Gardner fans rather than the average cinephile.",1469404800,7,1189,5.197916666666667
