8426967,5,B000LAZDQK,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!! I bought it for like 7 bucks at a store like 3 years ago, popped it in, and had the best butt and leg workout ever! It gets straight to the point and has you doing a series of uncomplicated squats and lunges and by the end of the workout leaves you feeling a great burn. I misplaced it and went crazy, so I searched all over the internet trying to find it (couldn't remember the name) and when I saw it here on amazon I was over joyed! BUY THIS! do it 3 times a week and you will see and feel results! I never write reviews but had to give this DVD the praise it deserves.",1392249600,,601,3.894308943089431
