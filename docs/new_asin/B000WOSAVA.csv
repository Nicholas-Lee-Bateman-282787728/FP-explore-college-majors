2988702,5,B000WOSAVA,"I purchased this last week and it is the best exercise DVD/tape that I have, which is about 15+.  I love it and can do all the moves.  It's easy to follow and I feel great after.  I like being able to customize the workout.",1202515200,3,223,3.911111111111111
2988703,5,B000WOSAVA,"I absolutely love Kathy Smith's workout videos and bought this one and was not disappointed. She does a short workout (about 4-5 minutes), and then comes a 20 minute cardio workout, then a 10 minute upper, 10 minute lower and a 5 minute cooldown.  I am used to doing much 'harder' cardio workouts from her but this one concentrated on working your core, which is meant to strengthen your core and abs, not just give you a sweat.  By the end of the 20 minute cardio, I was sweating (just not as much as I'm used to).  Her upper and lowers were 10 minutes each and that was a little on the short side for me.  I'm used to doing a 20 minute upper and 20 minute lower, which I feel is more beneficial.

If you have 50 minutes to spare, this is a great all-over body workout that does cardio, upper and lower along with a warmup and cooldown.  My favourite DVD from Kathy Smith is her ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight Volume 2"".

I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is looking for an all-in-one workout.  If you're looking for more of a complete workout, then go for her aerobics and do 40 minutes of that along with one of the workouts on Lift Weights to Lose Weight Volume 2.",1198368000,59,1174,4.233183856502242
2988714,4,B000WOSAVA,"I have a few of Kathy Smith's traditional workout dvds thanks to recommendation from Amazon reviewer.  I've had to change to Pilates from more traditional workouts because my back is still recovering.  This entire workout routine covers all the bases, except make sure you've seen a real Pilates dvd before doing this one.  I'm still fairly new at it.  Bought 3, returned 2 - well thanks Amazon for offering me 46-79 cents free return.  Bought 2 more & returned 1.  I tried to read review as best I could if they would work for me - downward dog, ugh!  please, some of them used that move every few minutes!  At least this dvd does not.  Keeping this one along with Denise Austin's Shrink you Fat Zones and her dance one too.  This dvd does not cover anything about Pilates, just references it which is fine since it is not my first one.  Nice because you can do entire program or select from 4 individual routines if you don't have time for entire:  warm up, weights/strength, cardio, stretch (she calls cool down).  Note, even the warm up gets your heart up.  I only had to slightly modify 2 positions and only unable to do 1 (so I just replaced it with another movement).  I am still recovering from herniated disc and am being very overprotective.  After successfully doing this program I might try some of her other routines, just the modified/lower impact versions which she does touch on in this dvd as well (she does a more thorough job of lower impact options in her more traditional workout dvds) but she does offer a few.  She does OK describing the different moves and when to start them, not great, but better than many.  The first go round I had to stop & go back to catch 2 of the moves, but it was not an issue so I'll know them next go round.  She does do quite a few repetitions but I have no problem with that, the moves are effective starting with the basic and then she adds arms.  Music is again OK, not bad again better than many.  I would have liked a bit longer option for strength/weights, it was short so I'll make sure to use another dvd with more weights tomorrow.  Nice addition to mix things up a bit to avoid boredom.  Enough trouble trying to stay motivated.",1433980800,,2191,4.4089775561097255

2988717,5,B000WOSAVA,I love this video!! The 20 minute cardio workout is intense and works up quite a sweat! The upper and lower body pilates segments are also top notch. I have had a previous video from Kathy Smith and literally wore it out from faithfully viewing it. I use this video on the 3 days a week I don't go to the gym. Its a great supplement to my weekly routine. This video would also be a good choice for someone who doesn't want to go to a gym but wants results at home.,1406505600,,464,4.0

2988719,4,B000WOSAVA,"I feel great when I am done with this workout. Long, lean, worked and relaxed. Great instruction, easy to follow, she makes you want to do it over and over. Not the hardest workout I own, right up in the top 24 that I go back to again and again. Silly to say this is three workouts in one though. Do the whole thing.",1386806400,2,316,3.953125

2988723,5,B000WOSAVA,"I really enjoy working out with this video. It has a variety

you are burning calories while enjoying yourself with her and her group.",1362441600,,254,4.204081632653061
2988724,5,B000WOSAVA,"Kathy Smith has been a favorite for many years. This was my first Pilates DVD, and I'm hooked on the wonderfully relaxed feeling when session is finished. Great for those unable to do high impact any more.",1359158400,,205,4.5675675675675675
2988725,4,B000WOSAVA,"Quite a few people complain about the aerobic portion of this DVD. I can't figure out why, as it is in the description. I like it! I have several Ellen Barrett DVD's and this one is more challenging. I useit when my back is going to cooperate with a higher impact workout.",1327449600,,272,4.25
2988726,4,B000WOSAVA,"This DVD has 3 separate routines - 20 min Cardio, 10 Arms/Chest and 10 Lower Body - you do all three with the warm-up and cool down or mix and match.  The 10 minute segments are challenging.  Kathy Smith is well known and has lasted so long in this business for a reason.  I use this DVD in conjuntion with her ""Tummy Trimmer"" DVD as well.  I'm really glad that I bought it!",1313452800,,374,4.082191780821918
2988727,5,B000WOSAVA,"I had never attempted Pilates before I bought this DVD. I wasn't even sure what it was but I know people who love it. I was surprised just how easily I could get into it. My fitness level is very low so I wanted something that I could do that would challenge me but not kill me!

This Pilates DVD works your core and stresses elongating your muscles for a toned body. Another great feature is the ability to select which parts you want to do that day for a specific workout. I am able to do the arms easier than the legs because I have more weight to lift with my legs but I definitely feel good about my workout every time I do the DVD.

If you want to have a good, short and effective workout, this is the one to buy!",1303689600,2,719,3.986111111111111
2988728,4,B000WOSAVA,"Let's be honest. What first interested me in this workout was the Amazon price. At only $5.99, I thought, what the heck. Well, it was a great investment. This workout is perfect for a lighter day. But, don't be fooled, it is an effective workout. It was hard enough that I felt challenged but nice for a day when I don't want too much exertion. It is a wonderful addition to my workout rotation. And, I love being able to program the chapters.",1274572800,2,443,4.349397590361446
2988729,5,B000WOSAVA,I ordered this to add to my collection of pilates dvd's for my workouts. This makes an excellent addition. Well worth the money.,1271203200,,128,4.608695652173913
2988730,2,B000WOSAVA,"The first ""Cardio"" portion is sort of dance routine. Not pilates, which I feel is misleading as it was not mentioned in the product description. The second half is pilates but they are short segments. I did not want a dance routine with this DVD and I feel kind of ripped off. I am really glad that I did not pay full retail price.",1267056000,5,331,4.1875
2988731,5,B000WOSAVA,"At first I thought this DVD would be too ""easy"" for me. I was surprised at how much I felt the muscle fatique the next day.
It seems innocent enough..starting out with knee bends then waving the arms side to side to engage the obliques...it gets harder from there.
The ""dance"" part is a series of leg lifts, plies, lunges, gravevines with leg lifts, and always arm movements to go with them.  I did sweat a bit--not a lot, but I did get pretty warm.  (Say a 6 1/2  out 10)
The mat work was perfect for me. I liked the leg and ab section especially. I felt it the next day.
I only do this DVD every few weeks, but I am enjoying it more each time I do it ;-)",1248220800,8,656,3.9545454545454546
2988732,5,B000WOSAVA,"It's a great workout that doesn't over exsert but still  works up a good sweat. I have always been a Kathy Smith fan and with getting older, I don't need a workout that's going to stop me from working out the rest of the week because I can't move from tired and sore muscles.  This is perfect.",1243036800,,293,4.12280701754386
2988733,4,B000WOSAVA,"This is the workout you need for those days when you want to exercise, but you don't want to feel like you've been hit by a bus afterwards.  Know what I mean? :-)  It's ""nice,"" to put it plain and simple.  It feels really good and is just challenging enough.  If you do it giving your best effort, you will feel worked from head to toe.  Do focus on the advice Kathy Smith gives about your form because that really adds to the results.  When I come to the upper body section, I use 3 lb. weights, whereas in other workouts, I can do 5lbs. at least.  This workout targets the muscles you are trying to get at, so you have to go a little lighter!  But when it's over, you'll feel great!",1240272000,,684,4.090225563909774
2988734,5,B000WOSAVA,"This is my first Kathy Smith purchase. I've rented one of her dvds in the past but I didn't like the style of that particular video. Well, I'm so glad I decided to pick this one up! Kathy is a fabulous instructor, and I rank her right up there with Denise Austin (my absolute favorite). She is constantly offering insight on how to keep perfect form for each exercise.

The set reminds me of the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. The music is very Cafe del Mar. The cardio workout has no jumping so it's very easy on the joints. Some of the reviews made it sound like a dance workout, which I was not looking for. It's actually very fast-paced standing pilates with some jazz-inspired movements. All-in-all, it's an elegant routine that is simple to follow yet very engaging and fun.

Next was the toning portion. The upper body workout was basically Pilates with weights. That's a very challenging combination! The lower body workout really isolated the core. My muscles were sore all over by the end of the dvd, but it was such a pleasant experience that I was already looking forward to doing it again.

I'm so glad I found such an intense workout that is also so much fun (usually it's one or the other). Kathy Smith has got herself a new fan!",1236643200,2,1241,4.482300884955753
2988735,4,B000WOSAVA,If you love classic jazz dance then this is for you.  It's easy to dance through like a classic jazz dance warmup but with the benefit of core training and a little booty sculpting too.  Is it tae-bo?  No.  It's chill but intense and you just feel good afterwards.,1231545600,,264,4.326530612244898
2988736,5,B000WOSAVA,"This DVD really works your core through a cardio/pilates mixture that starts with a warm up than targets your upper and lower body workouts with a very nice cooldown to close it out.  I found the sections to be a real good length for me since I am stil early on in trying to workout, so as a beginner to cardio and toning I liked it.",1230940800,2,333,4.045454545454546
2988737,5,B000WOSAVA,"I really like this workout with it's emphasis on Pilates principles.  After experiencing back problems for the past few months, I have found this workout to be very beneficial.

The workout assumes a basic knowledge of Pilates: using your core muscles.

The cardio section is fast and moderately challenging.  The upper body section is great, I have noticed a definite difference in my arms, even though I was lifting heavier weights before I started with this routine.  The lower body section is also challenging.

I have purchased many Kathy Smith workouts over the past 14 years, and this is one of my favorites.",1221004800,,615,4.922330097087379
2988738,4,B000WOSAVA,"I'm not normally a big Pilates fan, but I do like Kathy and thought I'd give this a go to mix up my current routine.  It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.
I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to.  You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time.  There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that.  With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat).  I really like how you can play this in any order.  Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.
Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results.  I certainly felt this for a day or two afterwards.  Can't wait to try this for my second time.",1219104000,6,982,4.327868852459017
2988739,5,B000WOSAVA,"I agree that the cardio is a lttle dancey, but it is easy to follow and a good workout.  The pilates was intense, but not too intense.  I felt the burn afterwards.",1213833600,3,163,4.0625
2988740,5,B000WOSAVA,"I do a lot of Leslie Sansone workouts, so the cardio on Peel Off the Pounds was a really nice change -- low impact, no complexity, nice jazzy music.  You can make it as dancey or athletic as you like.  Kathy follows up the cardio with some nice muscle conditioning pilates moves for the entire body -- again, nothing too difficult, but definitely enough to know you've been worked.  Highly recommended for beginners,  beginner/intermediates, or intermediates (like me!)",1211068800,16,469,4.9743589743589745
2988741,4,B000WOSAVA,"I really like both the workouts and the format of the DVD.  My previous workout videos had all been on VHS, so I was happy to see that with this DVD, you can pick and choose from the warm up, cardio, upper/lower body pilates and cool down to make as lengthy or as brief a workout as you would like.  For someone who had not worked out for almost 4 years (pregnancy, baby, etc.), I found the cardio to be more than adequate.  I would say that newbies (or those as out of shape as I am!), this will be a challenging workout that you can grow into.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the cardio was ""dancey"" because it was, and I find it challenging to do mambo type dance steps.  That's the only reason I've given it a 4 instead of 5.",1205107200,10,738,4.027397260273973
2988742,3,B000WOSAVA,This workout is fun but not very intense.  The pilates standing and mat sections are much better than the cardio section.  It is good for a day when your muscles are tired but you still want to work out.  It is hard not to like Kathy Smith no matter what she does.,1203120000,20,264,4.038461538461538
2988743,2,B000WOSAVA,"She is a little dancy in the aerobics part, which i am not into, but it is a good aerobic workout for me. The pilates part is good, but not spectacular.",1202601600,13,152,3.935483870967742

3223228,5,B000WOSAVA,"At first I thought this DVD would be too ""easy"" for me. I was surprised at how much I felt the muscle fatique the next day.
It seems innocent enough..starting out with knee bends then waving the arms side to side to engage the obliques...it gets harder from there.
The ""dance"" part is a series of leg lifts, plies, lunges, gravevines with leg lifts, and always arm movements to go with them.  I did sweat a bit--not a lot, but I did get pretty warm.  (Say a 6 1/2  out 10)
The mat work was perfect for me. I liked the leg and ab section especially. I felt it the next day.
I only do this DVD every few weeks, but I am enjoying it more each time I do it ;-)",1248220800,8,656,3.9545454545454546
3223229,5,B000WOSAVA,"It's a great workout that doesn't over exsert but still  works up a good sweat. I have always been a Kathy Smith fan and with getting older, I don't need a workout that's going to stop me from working out the rest of the week because I can't move from tired and sore muscles.  This is perfect.",1243036800,,293,4.12280701754386
3223230,4,B000WOSAVA,"This is the workout you need for those days when you want to exercise, but you don't want to feel like you've been hit by a bus afterwards.  Know what I mean? :-)  It's ""nice,"" to put it plain and simple.  It feels really good and is just challenging enough.  If you do it giving your best effort, you will feel worked from head to toe.  Do focus on the advice Kathy Smith gives about your form because that really adds to the results.  When I come to the upper body section, I use 3 lb. weights, whereas in other workouts, I can do 5lbs. at least.  This workout targets the muscles you are trying to get at, so you have to go a little lighter!  But when it's over, you'll feel great!",1240272000,,684,4.090225563909774
3223231,5,B000WOSAVA,"This is my first Kathy Smith purchase. I've rented one of her dvds in the past but I didn't like the style of that particular video. Well, I'm so glad I decided to pick this one up! Kathy is a fabulous instructor, and I rank her right up there with Denise Austin (my absolute favorite). She is constantly offering insight on how to keep perfect form for each exercise.

The set reminds me of the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. The music is very Cafe del Mar. The cardio workout has no jumping so it's very easy on the joints. Some of the reviews made it sound like a dance workout, which I was not looking for. It's actually very fast-paced standing pilates with some jazz-inspired movements. All-in-all, it's an elegant routine that is simple to follow yet very engaging and fun.

Next was the toning portion. The upper body workout was basically Pilates with weights. That's a very challenging combination! The lower body workout really isolated the core. My muscles were sore all over by the end of the dvd, but it was such a pleasant experience that I was already looking forward to doing it again.

I'm so glad I found such an intense workout that is also so much fun (usually it's one or the other). Kathy Smith has got herself a new fan!",1236643200,2,1241,4.482300884955753
3223232,4,B000WOSAVA,If you love classic jazz dance then this is for you.  It's easy to dance through like a classic jazz dance warmup but with the benefit of core training and a little booty sculpting too.  Is it tae-bo?  No.  It's chill but intense and you just feel good afterwards.,1231545600,,264,4.326530612244898
3223233,5,B000WOSAVA,"This DVD really works your core through a cardio/pilates mixture that starts with a warm up than targets your upper and lower body workouts with a very nice cooldown to close it out.  I found the sections to be a real good length for me since I am stil early on in trying to workout, so as a beginner to cardio and toning I liked it.",1230940800,2,333,4.045454545454546
3223234,5,B000WOSAVA,"I really like this workout with it's emphasis on Pilates principles.  After experiencing back problems for the past few months, I have found this workout to be very beneficial.

The workout assumes a basic knowledge of Pilates: using your core muscles.

The cardio section is fast and moderately challenging.  The upper body section is great, I have noticed a definite difference in my arms, even though I was lifting heavier weights before I started with this routine.  The lower body section is also challenging.

I have purchased many Kathy Smith workouts over the past 14 years, and this is one of my favorites.",1221004800,,615,4.922330097087379
3223235,4,B000WOSAVA,"I'm not normally a big Pilates fan, but I do like Kathy and thought I'd give this a go to mix up my current routine.  It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.
I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to.  You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time.  There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that.  With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat).  I really like how you can play this in any order.  Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.
Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results.  I certainly felt this for a day or two afterwards.  Can't wait to try this for my second time.",1219104000,6,982,4.327868852459017
3223236,5,B000WOSAVA,"I agree that the cardio is a lttle dancey, but it is easy to follow and a good workout.  The pilates was intense, but not too intense.  I felt the burn afterwards.",1213833600,3,163,4.0625
3223237,5,B000WOSAVA,"I do a lot of Leslie Sansone workouts, so the cardio on Peel Off the Pounds was a really nice change -- low impact, no complexity, nice jazzy music.  You can make it as dancey or athletic as you like.  Kathy follows up the cardio with some nice muscle conditioning pilates moves for the entire body -- again, nothing too difficult, but definitely enough to know you've been worked.  Highly recommended for beginners,  beginner/intermediates, or intermediates (like me!)",1211068800,16,469,4.9743589743589745
3223238,4,B000WOSAVA,"I really like both the workouts and the format of the DVD.  My previous workout videos had all been on VHS, so I was happy to see that with this DVD, you can pick and choose from the warm up, cardio, upper/lower body pilates and cool down to make as lengthy or as brief a workout as you would like.  For someone who had not worked out for almost 4 years (pregnancy, baby, etc.), I found the cardio to be more than adequate.  I would say that newbies (or those as out of shape as I am!), this will be a challenging workout that you can grow into.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the cardio was ""dancey"" because it was, and I find it challenging to do mambo type dance steps.  That's the only reason I've given it a 4 instead of 5.",1205107200,10,738,4.027397260273973
3223239,3,B000WOSAVA,This workout is fun but not very intense.  The pilates standing and mat sections are much better than the cardio section.  It is good for a day when your muscles are tired but you still want to work out.  It is hard not to like Kathy Smith no matter what she does.,1203120000,20,264,4.038461538461538

8224584,5,B000WOSAVA,"Kathy Smith's ""Peel off the Pounds Pilates,"" is one of the best Kathy Smith workouts I've ever tried. It has a jazzy soundtrack and the moves seem inspired by modern dance. The Warm Up is five minutes and includes shoulder rolls and leg stretches. Next up is the Cardio Workout which is quite challenging for a beginner as it has a lot of footwork to learn. So don't be surprised if it takes you a while to learn the steps. It is high energy. You will perhaps recognize things like the V-step. I felt this section was very well choreographed and fun to follow.

Next is the Upper Body workout with weights. This is a ten minute routine in which you will do push ups and plank. There are some advanced balance challenges while on all fours. Think lifting an opposite arm and leg and balancing.

The Lower Body workout is ten minutes with a traditional pilates floor format. I recognized single leg stretch and leg circles. There are very few modifications in this workout and there are some advanced exercises for a challenge.

The Cool Down is only five minutes and mostly consists of stretches for the legs. Not enough time is spent on stretching for the core and arms. I would have liked this segment to have been ten minutes. I was ready to really stretch out. But I suppose they were trying to keep this to 60 minutes total. So maybe just do some of your own stretches as the credits roll.

Overall I felt this mostly in my core, like it was tightening and toning. I have a feeling I'm going to be sore tomorrow! I really enjoyed this and felt I did get a full body workout.
