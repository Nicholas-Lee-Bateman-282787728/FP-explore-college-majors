200825,5,1598038990,"We really need to go back to basics of cooking again. With all this fast food and instant TV dinners, the quality of health of the human being is deteriorating. I would not go to the extreme of the ""slow food"" philosophy, because, although it has its merits, it ends up becoming very snobish because only Ancien Regime people could afford to get all those original pristine materials and the sophisticated chefs to cook for them. But if you go back to basics you can prepare very tasty, nutritious and healthy food yourself for you and your guests.",1395273600,8,548,4.6020408163265305
200826,5,1598038990,"Great get off the ground instructions. Describes equipment and food terminology. This series with Chef Bill Briwa will give Martha Stewart a challenge.

At first it seems a little strange as you are expecting more of a documentary style. What you get is a full fledged chef that challenges you to experiment.

I am going though the series for a second time to see what I missed while thinking at the time he was demonstrating.",1390176000,19,426,4.666666666666667
200827,5,1598038990,"I acquired this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved it.  The Great Courses Series, regardless of the topic are extremely thorough and well done.  I was very happy to find this multi-disc set at a bargain price.  The shipper was extremely quick with this order as well, and it arrived in plenty of time for the holidays despite the late order.  Thanks!",1389225600,18,361,4.424242424242424
200828,4,1598038990,"I am only up to lesson 4, but I can say that the chef is very good, explains things very well, speaks well into the camera.  I had sent another course back due to the professor being horribly boring.  This chef/teacher is very good.  I can't give it 5 stars only because I wish it had more close-ups.  He'll be showing you something and you can't see it right away and then there will be a close up, but just briefly.  The one thing I absolutely HATE about this course is it has graphics that are so distracting--boxes and stripes of red, tan, green stripes that keep zooming in and out of the frame.  You really have to be able to ignore these.  I'm working on that, but it's not easy.  I truly don't get why they would do graphics like that instead of just putting it on the screen discreetly.  It's a nice basic course from what I can tell.  The first lesson about taste vs. flavor was pretty boring but it got better in #2.
**Update--I am on DVD#2 now and have really learned a lot.  I can't say enough about Bill Briwa, I think his name is.  He really explains things very well.  I hope he comes out with another course, in more detail.  I would buy it.  Still dealing with the graphics but they have been a bit less it seems, the farther on I've gotten in the program.",1378944000,39,1274,4.185185185185185
200829,5,1598038990,"Gives you all the basics and the chef that teaches you is very relaxed, down-to-earth, and relateable.  He explains things clearly and gives lots of demonstrations.  Enjoyable to watch and easy to follow.",1373500800,23,204,5.151515151515151

7800023,5,1598038990,"I mostly use my microwave-convection oven rather than my stove, but I wanted to get a brief refresher on how to cook on the stove.  Master Chef Briwa does an excellent job of explaining the physics and chemistry of cooking--and the craft aspects involved.  Many of the lectures involve French cooking and terminology, but there are also many recipes from Asia, South America, and other parts of Europe.  Most dishes combine meat with vegetables for a ""balanced"" diet.  Even different wines are discussed.  Recommended.",1482278400,,518,5.119047619047619

7800025,5,1598038990,"This was the first of The Great Courses that I tried - I actually bought this on a physical copy on 4 DVDs instead of streaming the video. The DVDs which came with an accompanying hardover coursebook, which was basically an outline of the material covered.

First of, Chef Bill Briwa (the course instructor) is knowledgeable, relatable, and amiable. The approach here is not a ""follow the directions in the recipe"" approach, but more of a culinary technique approach, using taste, touch, smell, and sight to cook. This might be a little off-putting to amateurs at first (it was for me), but stick with it - your first kitchen experiments might be disasters, but you will learn more about flavor balance and cooking instinctively eventually. There are 24 lessons here, of varying lengths, and they really are more like lessons rather than lectures. Chef Briwa is obviously an accomplished cook, and I really liked his craftsman-like approach to cooking. I plan on watching these a couple more times from the beginning, hoping to pick up some of the things I might have missed the first time around.

I would also strongly recommend picking up an additional companion book, like The America's Test Kitchen Cooking School Cookbook if you are just starting out, since it's also highly visual and will fill in a lot of the gaps from these DVDs. Highly recommended.",1454889600,4,1359,4.878787878787879

7800028,5,1598038990,"Four and 1/2 Stars.  Very well done. Chef Briwa takes you thru the essential fundamentals of a trained chef. I was very pleased with his presentation and the skill set he builds. Great emphasis is placed on developing abilities (including tasting skills, wine pairing, equipment, spices, sauces and stocks, ingredients, etc..), rather than on specific recipes. Chef Briwa does use many complete dishes/recipes in his presentations. I took the half star because of a few too many digressions into Thai dishes that struck me as excessively sweet, and tertiary at best to the rest of the course.

I also ordered the hardcover book, which is more of a guide thru the course than a cookbook. I have used it several times and am happy to have it. It saved me the tedium of note taking while viewing the lessons.",1438560000,9,805,4.784172661870503
