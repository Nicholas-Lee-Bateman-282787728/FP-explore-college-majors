This box set comes with 122 episodes, the movie, tons of extras that I still havn't gotten through, and not to mention a bobblehead of both beavis and butt-head. If you're a true fan of Beavis and Butt-Head then Mike Judge's genius box set will satisfy you.",1278547200,3,332,4.370967741935484

The extras are amazing and offer great behind-the-scenes info.  Not to mention the bobble-heads are not to be missed.  A must-have, one-stop collection.",1271376000,2,277,4.956521739130435
