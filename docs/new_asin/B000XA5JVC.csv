8227544,5,B000XA5JVC,"Harry Manx needs to be experienced.  Drenched in two ancient traditions--the blues (African music) and raga (indian) -- he mixes both worlds, lap steel blues on his six-string and Hindustani slide on his Mohan vena. On some numbers, he blends the two styles, which may upset purists, but will open the ears of anyone willing to give a listen.  His journey, told in the interview sections,  is an impressive one from the street to the ashram to the street to stage and studio. Kudos to the Grossman guitar workshop for capturing his story and songs on film.",1469923200,,556,4.711340206185567
8227545,5,B000XA5JVC,"Great guitarist.  Wonderful arrangements.  New twists on some old songs.  Unfortunately Harry doesn't seem to get much to where I live (Washington, DC area) so this is the next best thing.  The nice thing about this DVD is that Harry spends some time introducing the songs and his arrangements.",1451520000,,294,4.938775510204081

8227547,5,B000XA5JVC,"Harry Manx is fairly new to me - only known of him in the last couple of years so I've been in 'catch up' mode! If you are a fan then this DVD is 'hard to resist' and is really a must have! Not only is the music great but the man is interesting and informative. He talks about life, himself, music and the instruments he plays. A real nice guy!",1383350400,,344,3.859154929577465
8227548,5,B000XA5JVC,"At first, upon realizing that the disc was not an instructional DVD, I was disappointed, but after viewing it all the disappointment vanished. I have watched it several times and truly enjoy the production, plus they show enough close shots to allow anyone who
is interested in learning some of the tunes to pick them up fairly easily.
The Guitar Artistry of Harry Manx is aptly named",1377648000,,384,4.746268656716418
8227549,5,B000XA5JVC,"Last year at an Arts Presenters conference a friend said to me ""You must see Harry Manx perform!"". Harry was just performing a 20-minute ""showcase"" and I set it on my schedule. In the short 20 minutes Harry engaged the audience with most unique style of guitar playing - and beautiful instruments to boot! Literally a world traveler, this Canadian singer/songwriter/musician spent 25 years living in Europe and 11 in India before coming back to North America. Originally a blues and rock player, Manx became fascinated with Indian Ragas and became a Master of the Mohan Veena (a 20-string instrument, played like both a Sitar and a Guitar.

I immediately seeked out Harry's CDs and love them all. Then I found this DVD. If you are already a Harry fan (or as he often says, ""in the Harry Zone"") and you haven't seen this 90-minute video, than it's a must. If you are new to Harry, check out some music samples on Amazon and then get this DVD. Producer Stefan Grossman invited Harry to come to his New York studio in 2007 and -using high-quality camera (with lots of close-ups) - he let Harry play a variety of instruments, sing a variety of songs and introduce each one, giving an oral autobiography in the process.

I'm not a fan of Indian and sitar music, but love the blues and any talented guitar picker. But Harry is not playing Indian music. He is playing acoustic folk music on an Indian-inspired instrument. The only thing missing here is Harry on banjo (and he has a beautifully decorated one. Maybe he left it home. And - with the video - you'll see Harry's unique lap style of playing.

Anyway, Harry will probably make you a fan, as he did me, in just a few minutes of listening - or watching - time. Big thanks to Grossman for making this DVD available!
