8347460,4,B001WAKUKW,"I bought this DVD because I couldn't find any other DVD overview of Iceland anywhere after searching the web.  I am planning a trip to Iceland and this DVD does an excellent job of taking you through each region of Iceland and showing you the sights. The regions are neatly divided into chapters and a map at the beginning of each chapter to orient you .  The narrative was informative but at times was drowned out by the awful music.  Unfortunately some of the most annoying selections were repeated in the video.  A word of advice:  Don't buy the other Iceland's Favourite Places that only cover one region.  They are all covered in this comprehensive video for the same price as the regional DVD's.  I would recommend it, but turn the volume down.",1342137600,10,750,4.593984962406015
8347461,1,B001WAKUKW,"this video is a collection of uninspired tourist snaps with terrible image quality (high definition is mentioned on the cover, I think not); it is an effort to make a boringdocumentary about such a fascinating country, but yes, this is it! no more!",1325462400,2,248,4.790697674418604
8347462,4,B001WAKUKW,"I ordered this DVD as a gift for geologist friends who told me they would like to visit Iceland sometime.  I watched it before I sent it to them to make sure it had enough depth that a geologist would be interested in seeing it.  The DVD gives extensive views of natural and cultural features all over Iceland.  The views were amazing to me who has never been there.  Now I want to go to Iceland myself!  The filming was excellent and shows features a scientist or a layperson would really like to see.  The DVD was somewhat crude in how it was set up to move around within the DVD like to go back and see things again or pick a part to look at.  However, the excellent views made up for any technical difficulty in navigating the DVD.",1264550400,8,735,4.207142857142857
