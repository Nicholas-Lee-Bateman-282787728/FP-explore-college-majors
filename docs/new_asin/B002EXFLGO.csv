Tuva Novotny plays Jonas's girlfriend Camilla who has become tired of the deterioration of their relationship since his father's death. Starting out playing a moaning child in the Swedish nightly soap Skilda V&auml;rldar (Swedish version of Australia's Sons and Daughters) in the late 1990s, Novotny now seems to play the girlfrined role in Danish films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Time-for-Love-2009-Simon-Malou-Ingen-planer-om-krlighed-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Denmark/dp/B003VHUHLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Time for Love (2009) ( Simon & Malou ) ( Ingen planer om krlighed ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Denmark </a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Truth-About-Men-Sandheden-om-mnd-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Denmark/dp/B005DUNW48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Truth About Men ( Sandheden om mnd ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Denmark </a>]).

The next morning following their meeting Jonas discovers Louise dead.
An ingenious film which kept me guessing until the end, Kandidaten is just over 90 minutes long. The time spent watching this flew by.
Viewers of recent Danish drama acquisitions in the UK will recognise a few faces in this piece. Swedish actor David Dencik (Those Who Kill /&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood/dp/B0040Y5K8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood</a>) plays Michael, Jonas's drinking friend.

Henning Valin (soon to be seen as policeman Jesper Andersson in The Bridge) plays another policeman, and Iben Dorner (Sanne - Borgen / Benedicte - Those Who Kill) pops up as a legal assistant.

If he is as good in that as he is in this, it will certainly be worth a watch!
Kandidaten is entirely in Danish with English subtitles and is co-production involving Danish TV2 produced in 2008. Extras on the disc include brief introductions to each character (in English) with a trailer for the film and a short teaser.

8368434,4,B002EXFLGO,"""Kandidaten"" (""The Candidate"") is a 2008 Danish thriller about a young lawyer Jonas Bechmann (Nikolaj Lie Kaas ""Angels & Demons""), whose father was killed in a car accident one year ago. Jonas still believes that the death of his father, a defense attorney for the feared crime lord, is really a murder, and Jonas is determined to investigate the ""case"" no matter what it takes, even though his relationship with his girlfriend Camilla (Tuva Novotny) gets strained.

Then one morning, after spending a night with a young woman Louise (Laura Christensen) Jonas met at the bar, he wakes up in a hotel room where he discovers the dead body of the woman. He doesn't remember what happened the night before. And he soon learns that someone might have been watching him all through the night.

The thriller feels slightly Hitchcockian, as it is paced well with a lot of twists and turns. The acting is very good, the editing is tight, and the film keeps you guessing until the end though I am afraid that not many mystery or suspense fans will find the conclusion as ingenious as the filmmakers think. In short, entertaining as it is, the film would leave most viewers with the impression that - well, what should I say - the characters' motives or decision-making processes are not very convincing.

""The Candidate"" is like a skillfully-made puzzle. You may be fascinated with the process of solving it, but once you see the whole picture, there is not much that would impress you.",1296432000,,1476,4.7578125
