After the intro, the breakdown of the warm-up, the warm-up itself is just 5 minutes.  What kind of warm-up is that. Maybe when I do the routine, I'll change the rating.",1169424000,,268,4.541666666666667

8129534,4,B000G8P1VY,"I am a beginning dancer and just can't get enought quality DVDs to work on outside of class.  This is fun and I was able to pick up the routine pretty quickly.  I like the warm up, it is challenging but not so hard you get frustrated.  I like the dance routine she teaches. There is one routine and then she starts with the partnering.  I would recommend this DVD but I only do the first half hour.  This has helped me to gain confidence because I have to repeat things many times before I get it.  The Broadway Dance Center DVDs are challenging and fun.",1159056000,3,554,4.179245283018868
