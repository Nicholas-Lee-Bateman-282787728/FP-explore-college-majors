7077015,5,B00V7ORQIM,"I really enjoyed this show when I watched it in Japanese online, but owning it presented a more crisp quality that my internet connection couldn't handle. The english dub was pretty good, and a nice addition to the set. The whole set is packed with various items, but most importantly (for me) the soundtrack.

Only issues I really had with this set was Sentai Filmworks continuing to interchangeably use yellow and white subtitles (for the Japanese), and the inability to disable subtitles on the blu-ray. The price was a little high on this item, but other than that, I have no complaints.

The No Game, No Life Collector's Edition is a solid collection, but if you're just a casual anime fan like me, then the standard blu-ray or DVD will still give you what you need at a more affordable price point. This particular set was definitely meant for hardcore fans of the show, but if you're wanting to go hardcore, this is the set for you!",1438214400,,939,4.616766467065868
7077016,5,B00V7ORQIM,I haven't bought the blue ray yet i'm planning on doing so and so should you! IMO one of the greatest anime I have ever seen so vibrant and fun! Fans show your support so we can get a season 2.,1438128000,,193,3.731707317073171
7077017,5,B00V7ORQIM,Excellent.,1438128000,,10,10.0
7077018,5,B00V7ORQIM,"One of the Best, if not the Best anime series I've ever seen. This is by far one of my favorite shows and is something I could watch over and over again without getting bored. As for the comments about ""lacking on the plot"" or having the plot ""fall short"" I'm not seeing it. The premise is fairly simple and easy to follow yet due to the nature of the ""rules"" involved (which is an integral part of the story/show itself) it becomes complex and interesting/more intriguing as the story progresses with great character designs/developments and the story line really builds up towards the end where it's left completely open and making you want to immediately have a second season. I would recommend this show to anyone who's bored with predictable protagonist character models and a lack of imagination when following a story line and would encourage those who want to see something unique, mentally stimulating, and cleverly delivered/written to give this show a watch, you will not be sorry.",1438128000,6,992,4.841176470588235
7077019,5,B00V7ORQIM,"First off this review is not based on the series itself, just in the packaging and presentation.

Just thought I would bring this up real quick. Now I haven't actually gone through the entire anime series yet, but I would just like to point out that the Collector's Edition (5 disc) contains the TV-14 version rated for violence and dialogue, or at least that is what it says on the back of the actual blu-ray and DVD cases side the box. The collectors box it comes in states TV-MA on the bottom for sexual situations, and most likely nudity. This is false, or at least it was in the one I got. Perhaps it was a packaging mistake, I don't know. I ordered the regular 2-disc version (which actually shows a picture of the back cover where it states TV-MA) to compare the two versions, but will not get that til later this week. It doesn't bother me either way, I like the extras you get with the collectors edition in any case. Just thought I would forewarn anyone who wanted the TV-MA version that they should avoid the collectors edition if they don't care for the extras. If anyone else got a collectors version that actually did contain the MA version feel free to respond, but as far as I know it does not. Thanks!",1438041600,5,1218,4.389380530973451
7077020,5,B00V7ORQIM,Can't wait till season 2 comes this fall,1437523200,,40,4.125
7077021,4,B00V7ORQIM,"First, a warning.  If you like complete plots as I do, this show ends in the middle and, as of now, there are no plans to produce a followup season.

I thought the show was really great while it lasted.  Sora and his much younger, possibly adopted, sister Shiro are geniuses, shut-ins, and gaming legends.  Online they call themselves Blank and they never lose.  They think nothing of going on 5-day gaming binges and living off of junk food.  One day, they beat a player at a game and receive a mysterious email about a world better suited for them, which they click on.  It turns out they defeated the god of games from another dimension and he transports them to that dimension.  In the other world, physical violence is not allowed and all conflict whether between individuals or between nations is resolved by games.  The world contains 16 different races, each with their own territory and ranking.  The humans or ""imanity"" as they are called here are dead last.  Sora and Shiro set forth on a campaign to restore the lost glory of the humans and the fun ensues!

The siblings are tactical geniuses and they use a lot of statistical, probability, mathematical, and scientific knowledge to win their games.  If you're not careful, you might actually LEARN SOMETHING from an anime show!  <shudder>

Now, for a bit of a complaint:

Apparently light novel series are big in Japan and often an anime is commissioned to adapt the first part of the series in order to increase interest in the books.  There is usually no plan to continue the anime past the point they were commissioned for and leave off.  As a result, there are a lot of anime series that just ""end in the middle"".  Some, like this show, end at a reasonable stopping point where nobody is missing, captured, possibly dying, etc.  Others just end on a cliffhanger.

I am curious why the American anime companies seem to inflict so many of these partial shows on us.  Is it because there are just not enough complete shows for them to license?  Not enough shows they think would be interesting to American audiences?  Are these shows cheaper to license and import?  There is frequently no English version of the light novels available here, so the fans of the series are just left hanging not knowing what happens after the anime ends.",1436140800,13,2299,4.645161290322581
7077022,5,B00V7ORQIM,"This anime is absolutely fantastically amazing. It's fun, it's cute and it's really really smart, not to mention the art direction is absolutely gorgeous. The second I finished this show I pre-ordered the collector's edition. Let's hope they actually follow through and make a second season for this.
It has only 12 episodes so it's not very long but the ride is sweet one.

This might very well be my favorite anime of all time, up there with FLCL and Kill la Kill.",1435104000,2,466,4.614457831325301

7077025,5,B00V7ORQIM,"The show was great and had me wishing it was longer or that there was a season two. The art style is pretty different from a lot of anime out there right now which is partially what attracted me to the show in the first place. What kept me was the storyline though and I very much look forward to No Game No Life: Zero (Whenever that comes out). I think the blu-ray version looks a little more washed out or dull in all honestly. I don't know if that was intended, but it's pretty hard to tell the difference between blu-ray and dvd in this show. The relationship between two of the main characters was a little creepy if you ask me though.

The collectors edition includes some art card, playing cards, stickers and poster(s). All in all I",1508284800,2,740,4.285714285714286

They use a lot of brighter colors and a unique mixture of colors to make it a beautifully made show. The comedy in this show is there I still laugh after watching it all the time. its a very intellectual show that uses logic and predictions to over come the opponent.

7077036,4,B00V7ORQIM,"I loved this anime. I watched it three times online,  twice subbed and once dubbed. It's a pervy anime and very NSFW, so be aware of you are watching in public somehow, or at work, or have someone that may come in your room and judge. The collector's edition was something I felt like I wanted for appreciation. The anime has beautiful artwork. Only complaint I have with the actual edition is that the sealant on he box came ripped (no damage to outer box) and the deck of cards look a little poorer in quality, as well as their box being damage :/ I'll get over it but it's still something that hurts collectibles like this. I can't tell if it was damaged during shopping or if it was re-sealed and was damage before shipping. I won't complain more than that. I'd say if you enjoy the anime, go for it. If you are iffy on it, then go for the normal blu ray",1491264000,,858,4.2
7077037,5,B00V7ORQIM,This is just amazing and I just loved everything that comes in the box how ever I am not to fond of the print outs there but really have many good pictures of the anime (unless you like the lewdish ones) It would have been more satisfying if they were concept art or some form of the pre-finished works.,1490572800,,303,4.1525423728813555

7077041,5,B00V7ORQIM,"This is a series that is definitely worth checking out and a BD that is very much worth getting. The one thing that will be hit or miss for people is the art style. I think it adds a fair amount of uniqueness to the show, but I can understand some that aren't a fan. Luckily you can tell simply from the box whether you can enjoy the art style or not.

There is a lot of value in this BD. You get the 12 episodes spread over two discs. There is also the option for the English Dub or you can go with the original Japanese audio with subs. The extras are pretty outstanding for an anime series collection. They've included six animated shorts (little 2-3 minute long scenes). Also included are the Japanese commercials for the show. A common but welcome inclusion is the clean (no text or ads) opening and ending sequences. But, the biggest thing is the really rare inclusion of the Japanese audio commentaries. I've almost never seen a show where these were included in the English release. Unlike regular movie commentaries the voice actors are staying in character and mostly ignore the episode that is playing. The commentary though is pretty fun and entertaining and covers 6 of the 12 episodes. They are worth watching for the comedy and some interesting character insights.

In the end I think this is a show worth getting. There is a lot of value with the extras and the show looks really good. The story and characters worked for me as well. I certainly enjoyed it and hope others will as well.",1478736000,5,1502,4.478102189781022

This release is pretty bare bones, and fair for the price. The disc art looks good, but that's all you really get. There's no art cards or inserts in the case. The subtitles are yellow, and there are no major problems with the translation. The dub is good, but really changes Shiro's (the small white-haired girl) voice.

If you have not seen this series I highly suggest you give it a try.  The main characters although act silly at times.....they do it on purpose...so that you cant see what they are truly planning.  This series is only the first part of the light novel series it is based on.  And I am hoping more Animes are made.

The dubbed version is average and in my opinion takes away from the expirence and feels out of place. Thankfully they have a subbed option to all dub-haters out their.

7077097,5,B00V7ORQIM,No Game No life is an amazing anime with some mild fan service. The writing style is comparable to the pop science fiction writer Timothy Zahn who created the most popular expanded universe books for Star Wars (Thrawn triology and Outbound Flight among others).,1445126400,,261,4.954545454545454
7077098,5,B00V7ORQIM,"Great CE item for fans of the show. I did an impulse buy and bought this before even seeing the anime, and the gamble paid off. The box is nice and shiny and hold everything in it. It comes with BluRay and DVD which is always convenient. Its also brings 3 discs which make up the soundtrack including original songs (with instrumental versions) and BG music, only downside is that the intro and outro are not included on these discs. Theres a box within the box that brings all the extra goodies which is really what makes it a CE worth getting.

The anime itself was really entertaining. I started on a Friday evening and by Saturday evening I finished and was sad that there was only 12 episodes. If they make another CE for season 2 (if there is a season 2) I will most definitely be purchasing.",1443830400,3,798,4.355704697986577

7077100,4,B00V7ORQIM,"I really liked this show.  I don't know why, I just did.  It's not an anime that will make you think but it's enjoyable.  I wanted more when it came to an end and isn't that usually a sign of a good anime?  I do hope that there will be a season 2.",1443139200,,247,3.6037735849056602

7077103,5,B00V7ORQIM,No game no life was one of the best anime from its season. The charm of this show isn't the story but seeing how Sora and shiro remain ten steps ahead of everyone else.,1441670400,,168,3.9705882352941178
7077104,4,B00V7ORQIM,"This is one of those shows where the enjoyment of watching isn't seeing IF the protagonists win, but rather seeing HOW they win. Unfortunately, the story is woefully incomplete, covering only 3 volumes of the novel series and only 2 of the 16 races of this fantasy world. With that said, it was fun while it lasted. There is some nudity; not porn mag-explicit, but it does include an underage girl with convenient censoring from steam and/or poses (in addition to two adult women with obvious breasts).",1441670400,4,502,4.781609195402299
7077105,5,B00V7ORQIM,"Beyond amazingly funny and quirky; you simply cannot help but enjoy yourself from the first episode through the last. This series is an absolutely necessary addition to most any collector's shelf, and truly not one to be missed. Do yourself a favor and buy it now, then watch immediately upon arrival. Even if this series is SOMEHOW, still unknown to you at this point, I have no reservations in recommending NG-NL!

I honestly cannot fathom anyone who does not thoroughly enjoy themselves, all the way from the opening scene through the final credits rolling. It's just one of those rare series that is basically.....well, basically flawless.",1441238400,2,643,5.066037735849057

7077135,3,B00V7ORQIM,"Funny series, but a flawed release because of a terrible decision by Sentai Filmworks that has forced me to subtract stars.

The subtitles are locked to the Japanese audio with no toggle for English Audio+English Subtitles. There are only two options, Japanese Audio+English Subtitles, and English Audio with No Subtitles. You cannot enable the subtitles with the English audio in any way, so anyone that has hearing problems or would like the subtitles on has to use the Japanese audio.

All attempts to change the audio and subtitles via remote when playing are locked and return ""This action is Prohibited"".",1439942400,38,610,5.09
7077136,5,B00V7ORQIM,"This series is fantastic. I like to describe it as the happy and smarter counterpart to Death Note. Death Note was all darkness, betrayal, murder and outsmarting others (just because they were geniuses it was always cool to see them outsmart each other but there was no real believability their). NGNL is extremely colorful, happy, overcoming adversity and making friends, everything is a game, and outsmarting others with legitimate logic, math, etc (and they usually explain how they got to that conclusion so you feel like you're actually learning). NGNL is one of my favorite anime series and I just had to preorder this bluray. The CDs have lovely artwork on them of Sora and Shiro both having their own disc. I also was surprised to find an english dubbing on here and it isn't that bad. Some voice actors aren't the best so you may still prefer the Japanese version, but I rather like Sora's english voice.",1439510400,3,913,4.784810126582278
7077137,5,B00V7ORQIM,"Y'know how you watch a mystery or game show and the protagonist reveal a secret they kept hidden for a long time and win the game or solve the problem.  Well this is the opposite the two main protagonists will wave the game winning piece in front of your face the entire time and you'll never even know it was there. It was amazing, they turn the biggest turning point in the games into a move so simple, you won't even notice. such clever and careful planning, great humor, and a decent amount of fanservice",1438646400,,508,4.347368421052631

8709462,3,B00V7ORQIM,It's an O.K. show but I could do without all the strategy explanations when they play their games (get's old quick). I did like the background colors that have a rainbow effect (unique to this show) and the main characters are very likeable but the expected adult level rating comes up short and not quite as good as Cat Planet Cuties or Queen's Blade Rebellion!!,1522886400,,363,4.6
