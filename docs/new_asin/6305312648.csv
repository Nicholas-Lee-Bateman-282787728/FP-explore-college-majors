To think that ""The New Zoo Revue"" is available after all these years! Thank goodness for video and the human desire to make a profit from old properties like this show! Well, it sure took long enough! Several tapes are now available, and the price is reasonable.
The two episodes on this tape are, to be honest, a bit more dated that I remember. Doug looks like a cross between Eugene Levy on ""SCTV"" and Weird Al Yankovic! His outfits are straight out of a used car salesman's attic trunk. Emmy Jo is stylin' as a turn of the decade go-go girl. And Freddy Frog looks kind of like a mashed pillow with a mouth.
The PC crowd will grimace at the very un-PC role models (like ""helper"" Emmy Jo, and ""Southern Belle"" Henrietta Hippo, who wants to continually stuff her face with food).
Undoubtedly, there will be those who say the show is unfit for today's youngsters (that just tells you who grew up in a too-strict home, didn't get the cool toys they wanted, and still haven't come to grips with it).
Yet, in the very opening scene, we have Charlie the Owl stepping into his Victorian birdcage elevator and decending to ground level, which will zap you right back to 1972, early morning, wearing plaid pajamas, a bowl of Fruit Brute or Cap'n Crunch cereal by your side in a Harvest Gold or Olive Green plastic bowl, and ""The New Zooo-ooo Review, Comin' right at you!""
It's pure innocence... and just plain fun, whether you recall the show from your youth or not!",978998400,2,1480,4.485185185185185
