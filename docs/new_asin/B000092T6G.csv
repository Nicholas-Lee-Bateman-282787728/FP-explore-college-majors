7988634,5,B000092T6G,"This is a gem of a movie, featuring a young Joan Plowright and an aging Laurence Olivier. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as an addition to my growing collection of Olivier's performances. It is amazing to couple it with ""The Entertainer"", the first collaboration of these two artists; acting of this caliber never ages!",1405468800,2,313,4.9245283018867925
7988635,5,B000092T6G,"I purchased this because I had just seen Joan Plowright in the title role of Mrs. Palfrey at The Claremont.  I had no idea what the story line was and had no expectations.  I was hoping for more of the superb abilities I had seen her bring to the screen from that beautiful film and I was not disappointed.  I was completely mesmerized by yet another brilliant portrayal of a very different type of woman than that I had just seen.  The acting prowess of Ms. Plowright is truly enormous and I wish we, here in America, had much, much more of her films and plays to watch. Her nuance is delectable and every word and gesture fairly bursts with a talent we don't often see in our American actresses.  In fact, all the actors in this piece are superior, right down to the waiter at the restaurant in which the opening scenes take place and from which she extends an invitation to tea to a bevy of guests.  Laurence Olivier plays, Sir Joseph. her older, wiser, witty and subdued husband clearly nearing the autumn of his life and she the eccentric, dramatic and dipso-maniacal ""Lady"" Pitts, who is a combination of Auntie Mame, Queen Isabella and Lady Chatterley  The young Polish man she entangles in her brandied web, Ernest, is played very deftly by Clive Arindell.  To him, she is Daphne to his Apollo and is the woman he is enamored of.  Youth also has its privileges this is one tea party that is even a bit madder than that of Alice. A story, not to be missed.",1399075200,,1463,4.408921933085502
