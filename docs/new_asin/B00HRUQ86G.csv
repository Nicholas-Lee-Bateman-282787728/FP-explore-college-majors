A Noir that somehow has been underrated. Effective and absorbing, this one will capture yur attention. Don't miss it!!!",1458518400,3,312,4.777777777777778
8635028,4,B00HRUQ86G,"This DVD from VCI contains the 1952 Film Noir that appeared as a double feature on an earlier VCI release but this time it is a stand-alone.  At the beginning of the feature it states that it has been restored by Kit Parker  Films (one of the companies in VCI's catalog) in 2005. The print image is sharp through most of the 84-minute running time though the contrast gets a bit light in the last 10 minutes or so. (Not a big deal). There some ""hum"" throughout that might not have been able to be removed without altering the sound.  VCI though to add readable subtitles to the film though I didn't need them. The Screen aspect is the standard 1.33:1 with black bars on either side on flat screen TVs.

Now to the film. It is an interesting piece of film noir with the sexy British actress Diana Dors as a clerk in a bookstore who comes under the influence of a recently released felon who convinces her to seduce her boss.  NO, I'm not really giving any spoiler here - I hate ""spoilers"". All the action I just listed happens in the first five minutes and sets into action the real story.

Now I do believe in truth is advertising and so I do want reveal a few things about the packaging. For one both the front and back of the DVD pkg says ""Starring Diana Dors"". Well, when the opening credit rol, you won't see her name until after all the other lesser-known actors (except maybe George Brent) are listed. It then says ""Introducing Diana Dors"". That's because she was at the beginning og her career. The front of the package has two images of DD. One is a small photo and the other is ""poster graphic"" of DD in either a two piece swimsuit or - more probably - a bra and panties. Do not expect to see Ms. Dors in this outfit or even see a tight blouse or cleavage.  It's not there. And Ms. Dors is only on screen for about 60% of the film.

Despite the somewhat misleading cover art, I still enjoyed the film and glad I saw it. If you like Film Noir you'll certainly like this.

There are no other ""special features"" on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
