1640874,3,B00005OKQL,"It can be a bit confusing if you haven't seen tekno-man (at least when watched in Japanese).  Not all the old characters names are mentioned, so you are left wondering who they really are.  The character Yumi Francois is the typical air-headed squeeky girl cluts who just happens to be one who gets all the power.  If she was not in it I would find it a much better show to watch.  It improves when Dead-end enters the story, but it has an anty-climax in only being 6 episodes long.  The creaters could have really taken this places.  Pitty. :/",1032998400,,544,4.39
1640875,5,B00005OKQL,"I first saw Tekkaman Blade in 1996 when it was released edited on UPN (under the name of Teknoman). I only found out that tekkaman blade and teknoman are the same quite recently. I bought Tekkaman Blade 2 on video right away. IT IS THE BEST ANIME EVER!!! It has a cool plot, cool characters, and SWEET mechas. (the tekkamen) If you are an anime or sci fi fan, then BUY THIS right away! You will not regret it! TEKKAMAN BLADE 2 IS THE BEST!! other animes reccommended: Neon Genesis Evangelion

1640876,5,B00005OKQL,"I had this series on VHS for a long time, but before I could get the DVD the publisher went under and new copies were next to impossible to find at a fair price.  And much to my surprise, the dub version is also on this disk.",1385942400,3,225,3.7872340425531914
1640877,3,B00005OKQL,Back and the 90s I seen this as a kid. But seeing it now well.... nostalgia Is the only thing its good for.,1367280000,,107,3.6956521739130435
1640878,2,B00005OKQL,"The series expand from the first generation of Teknoman, which was really good.  The problem is that it is very short.  Their biggest enemy is one Teknoman that defeated Blade and it concentrates on that one person.  There is a lot of room for improvements.  Seen it once and 9/10, I won't see again, it's more of a Japanese film with this one.  Characters are goofy and do goofy stuff which didn't have that in Teknoman.  If you're a Teknoman fan, go for it, but if you love Teknoman with a good story, to hell with this one.",1279238400,,526,4.316326530612245
1640879,2,B00005OKQL,"All the characters in this anime are a bunch of annoying **icks, particularly Natasha.  The original Tekkaman Blade, you felt the characters, you understood them, and the story was so deep.  Tekkaman Blade II is nonsense, it's just more mech battles and about a military tekkeman academy.  There was little point in why they were fighting other than your typical revenge, save the world crap.  It gets repetitive, a lot of the characters become **icks especially Star, who makes a return as cheif of the tekkaman academy.",1234051200,,521,4.954022988505747
1640880,5,B00005OKQL,"Ok since I've read the other reviews I thought I write one, and make things a lot clearer.

First off the reason why Tekkaman Blade 2 is so different from Teknoman is because it's the original UNCUT version. And since it's the original version - all of the character names and even the title is different.

Teknoman as most people would call it was once on UPN many years ago. Teknoman is a awfully EDITED version of Tekkaman Blade. Tekkaman Blade is the original title. Also many names of the characters were changed for the edited version. When Tekkaman Blade was edited to Teknoman- many footage was edited out. This ruined the show. Tekkaman Blade wasn't ment to be edited.

Tekkaman Blade 2 stayed to the original, and is by far 100 % better then Teknoman. Or I should say Tekkaman Blade and Tekkaman Blade 2 are better then Teknoman.

Sadly there is no way to see Tekkaman Blade (Teknoman) uncut. So there's only Tekkaman Blade 2.",1117584000,8,936,4.586826347305389
1640881,5,B00005OKQL,"For those of us who saw ""Teknoman"" on UPN 11 years ago (yes is has been a while), or the original Tekkaman Blade, Tekkaman Blade II comes as a great addition to the series. I highly recommed it to anyone for their anime collection (especially for fans of Guyver and Evangelion).",1115942400,,278,4.470588235294118
1640882,1,B00005OKQL,"I read the reviews about this but since I am a die hard fan of Teknoman or Tekkaman Blade, I thought, it just could not be so bad. However I was wrong. First of all, it is not the same producer who made Teknoman, meaning the drawings are off, and the caracters do not feel the same. What is even more disturbing is that in Teknoman, you get to know the caracters as Blade and as Star, where as in this DVD Star is going by a different name and Blade is constantly referred to as D-Boy, which is not a very manly name at all. They should have taken the names from the original series, even though those names were not the original Japanese names but in translation - who cares? Those names we were used to. Apart from that, Blade hardly shows up and then there is no longer any emotional conflict of any sorts. Something that made the original series so special. A few highlights are Dead End and David but even those two cannot really bring up the rating. All in all, the first impression of this DVD was pink. There are way to many colors and the most dominant one is pink. How can you have pink in an action / drama anime?
Just simply, please even though you might be curious just like me and a die hard fan of Teknoman, please resist the urge to buy this. It is definitely not worth a cent.",1076457600,2,1293,4.155378486055777
1640883,3,B00005OKQL,"Probably best known to Americans as TEKNOMAN(one of the first anime series to be broadcast on an American network), this 6-episode OVA takes place 10 years after the original TEKKAMAN BLADE television series. The alien forces of Radham have begun another assult on Earth. Now however, a whole division of Tekkaman fighters have sprung up ready to defend the world with their amazing power armor. One recruit into this new army is Yumi, a mechanic who accidently acquired the awesome power of the Volteker Reactor. But with rivalries within her fellow fighters, the advancing alien hordes, and the return of the original Tekkeman, Yumi has her work cut out for her. The animation here is a little better than the original TV series, plus it doesn't suffer from all that awful ""edited for television"" butchering job UPN did. It doesn't hurt if you have seen some of the TEKKAMAN BLADE series, or even TEKKAMAN KNIGHT(the original anime), but there is still a good amount of action and fun to make most anime fans hungry.",1051315200,,1018,4.85632183908046
1640884,5,B00005OKQL,"I love this movie, It is one of my all time favs!",1033430400,,49,3.1666666666666665
7948714,3,B00005OKQL,"Back in the day younger me thought this was cool as could be. I loved the suits. Tekkaman was awesome. It is amazing how one's perceptions can be so much more vivid and then you re-watch older works a few years past a decade later and find it just doesn't hold up to those memories.

My modern opinion is that this had potential, but I can see why this didn't get an extension beyond a six episode OVA. It does come across as having been rushed to production. There are dialogs and interactions that are just annoying and cringe-worthy to watch, yet some things were oddly interesting in comparison. Based on lacking character development. they seemed to have wanted this to be a dragged out series initially but had to compact into a six episode OVA for whatever reasons. This could have been a lot better with a full six additional episodes to fill in development and story progression.

I kind of wish that there was a modern reboot. The closest we have received in recent to this review was Gatchaman Crowds, Casshern Sins, and soon Infini-T Force project -whenever they finally get around to releasing that.",1501632000,,1112,4.6395939086294415
