8171397,4,B000MRNWT2,"I deliberated between 5 stars and 3 stars because the sound and picture quality is Terrible, but the idea behind this production is just so glorious. Before watching it, it's important to understand that this is a half-hour made-for-tv production filmed over 20 years ago to introduce children to both the story of Swan Lake and the idea of a story being told through dance. It is not a full scale technical production nor is it a substitute for seeing the full ballet. Compared to the Bolshoi and Royal, the dancing itself is very lackluster.
The Swan Lake story is framed and interjected with a secondary story where a grandfather tells his granddaughter the story of the swan queen on a wintry evening before a crackling fire. This frame story, along with the actual production/film quality is very dated and so comes off pretty mediocre, but it's clear that the grandfather's narration is to help young children comprehend the story itself.
The Swan Lake part of the story is where the genius glimmers through the inferior sound and film quality. They actual film it outside at night on the shores of a lake surrounded by mountains and trees. They cut back and forth between the dancers on a portable dance floor at the lake's edge and the dancers in the forest and in the lake itself. Going back and forth is more confusing than clarifying I think to the story, but the ideas behind this production are so lovely I enjoyed all of it in spite of the deficiencies. They significantly streamlined the story and the dancing to make it as simple as possible, and the only set was the lake itself and the surrounding forest. The other reviewer said that the cinematography and lighting were poor and shot from too far away to always see the dancers clearly, and while elements of this are true, I would argue that the cinematography, while dated and nowhere near the HD clarity we're now accustomed to, is the best part of this film. Some of the shots are close ups of the dancers, and some are sweeping panoramas that show the lake and forest beneath a night sky and the swans dancing by the water in true scale. Unlike your typical ballet where the lake is merely a backdrop painting or a set piece, the lake here is almost a character--it's real and it's vast and the dancers can interact with it. The spotlight on the swans during the night scenes make them absolutely glow, and the wide shots that show them dancing beneath the moon at the water's edge are pure magic.
I sincerely hope someone decides to remake this now that better equipment and technology are available because it's truly a brilliant idea.
Bottom Line: If you're looking for a full Swan Lake ballet or a crisp picture or crystal sound, this isn't it. This is more a curiosity, and if you're a collector like I am, this is worth owning simply for the ideas and the experience of seeing the Swan Queen and Siegfried actually dance on the shores of a moonlit lake.
**I've attached a few stills taken from the video. The quality of the actual film is better than the attached (for example you can see their faces and more detail), but not by much. The ideas and the atmosphere are what make this super short film worthwhile.",1458691200,,3193,4.593695271453591
8171398,1,B000MRNWT2,"File this one under ""live and learn"".  This production of Swan lake was performed by a state ballet.  And it was awful.  I had purchased it for my pre-teens to watch but decided to throw it away and re-order.  This time I selected one performed by the Kirov company and it was great.  So be careful which production you purchase. If it's marked with ""part of cultural collection"" it doesn't mean that it's good.",1403827200,,411,4.5
8171399,2,B000MRNWT2,"Let me start this review by saying that I am not a dancer and have no ability to critique the dancing in this video. What is problematic is the cinematography. There are scenes shot from such a distance you can barely see what is happening on stage. Other scenes are so poorly lit, it is difficult to see what the dancers are doing.",1183334400,6,332,4.285714285714286
8171400,5,B000MRNWT2,"I purchased this video to show my 4-1/2 year old before we took her to her first professional ballet company performance of Swan Lake.  The video told just enough of the story to spark her interest, it held her attention, and she actually followed the story line.  I know she enjoyed the ballet even more - and paid better attention - because of having seen it. The film itself is somewhat dark and a little dated, but my daughter certainly didn't care.  This video accomplished exactly what I needed it to - and, she still wants to watch it!",1016323200,5,542,4.454545454545454
