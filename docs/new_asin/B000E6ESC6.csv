2502133,5,B000E6ESC6,"The third season of RS is just as good as the previous two. I am loving it! I only wish there were more extras--at least this time Brosnan, Zimbalist and Roberts are all interviewed.",1145577600,2,182,4.382352941176471
2502134,5,B000E6ESC6,"Mystery and film lovers were delighted when Remington Steele returned for a third season. This stylish show filled the void for those fond of the light mystery and romance Stanley Donen had brought to the big screen. Season three was fun in the extreme, offering lovers of sophistated television all the fun they could handle.

Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were back in September of 1984 and so was the opening theme by Henry Mancini. The season opened with a bang on the French Riviera and before the season concluded the attractive stars would become involved in cases that would take them from Ireland to the Island of Malta.

Steele's references to classic films reached new heights when three huge stars from Hollywood's golden age appeared in ""Cast in Steele."" There was an episode  where Laura had to travel to Ireland to help Steele recover his memory, and another which took place at a baseball camp. ""Steele in the Chips"" was a wildly fun episode involving the formula for a no-calorie chocolate chip cookie.

Guest stars like Lloyd Nolan, Geena Davis, Jean Smart, Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Lamour, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Stephanie's dad), and Michael Constantine, who appeared in two episodes, added flair to an already great show fans had grown to love.

""Remington Steele"" was never about the guest stars, however, but rather Steele and Laura themselves. Brosnan was terrific as the debonair man of mystery with a somewhat shady past and Stephanie Zimbalist was truly wonderful as the founder of the detective agency that couldn't get off the ground until she invented Remington Steele. The anticipation of their romance kept viewers coming back each week just as much as the mysteries.

Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. One could say they were our generations Nick and Nora Charles. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura.

Here are the cleverly titled episodes from season three: STEELE AT IT - LOFTY STEELE - MALTESE STEELE - SECOND BASE STEELE - BLUE BLOODED STEELE - STEELE YOUR HEART AWAY - A POCKETFUL OF STEELE - PUZZLED STEELE - CAST OF STEELE - BREATH OF STEELE - LET'S STEELE A PLOT - GOURMET STEELE - STRONGER THAN STEELE - HAVE I GOT A STEELE FOR YOU - SPRINGTIME FOR STEELE - STEELE IN THE FAMILY - DICED STEELE - NOW YOU STEELE IT, NOW YOU DON'T - ILLUSTRATED STEELE - STEELE IN THE CHIPS - STEELE TRYING - STEELE OF APPROVAL

There are only a handful of shows in the history of television so beloved by fans. ""Remington Steele"" was a reminder to us all just how enjoyable and entertaining it can be. You always felt good after watching an episode of ""Remington Steele"" and now you can do so at your leisure with the complete season from 1984. It was a very good year for TV.",1144108800,34,2998,4.708015267175573
2502135,5,B000E6ESC6,I'm so glad that the release dates between each season isn't taking forever. I have bought the first 2 seasons and passed them on to friends to watch. We have all enjoyed watching this great show with our kids and not having to fear them seing the kind of graphic violence and gore that so many shows feature today. I've just pre-ordered season 3 and I am really looking forward to enjoying it. I'm really hoping they will also release the further seasons of Hart to Hart in as timely a fashion. Hart to Hart and Remington Steele are two classic T.V. shows I remember fondly from my childhood. It's so great having something for the whole family to enjoy avaliable at last. Now if only they'd release Scarecrow and Mrs. King on DVD.,1139097600,34,732,4.470149253731344
2502136,5,B000E6ESC6,"The debonair ex-con-man and strait-laced detective return in the third season of ""Remington Steele."" This smart, funny detective series was one of the last of its kind, wonderfully odd and full of sometimes all-too-realistic crimes to be solved, and this season solidifies its tight storytelling.

During a trip to the Riviera, Laura (Stephanie Zimbalist) decides to go the distance with Steele (Pierce Brosnan) at last -- only to have him enmeshed in a web of blackmail, murder, and a precious dagger. Needless to say, that puts a damper on her romantic plans. Questions about his past crop up again when he turns up in Ireland, suffering from amnesia, after trying to discover his origins.

But Steele's past isn't the only thing on these detectives' minds: a no-calorie cookie, a dead body that has to be kept hidden, restauranteurs trying to kill a savage critic, teenage pickpockets, baseball camps, obnoxious neighbors, Maltese treasure, and three aging movie stars ask for help in finding out who is trying to kill them.

The comedy is still firmly in place: There are sinister plots centering on murder, embezzlement and Steele's attempt to redeem a teenage pickpocket, who reminds him of himself many years before. But woven in those is plenty of barbed humour, such as corporate bigwigs scrabbling on the floor for a fat-free cookie.

Having gotten a solid formula in the second season, ""Remington Steele"" chugged along with more odd mysteries. Okay, few of these mysteries resemble real crimes (a comic strip inspires attacks on the cartoonist?), but they are often funny, witty and intelligent.

We only get a few hints about Steele's past -- he may be from Ireland, but not much more than that. In one episode, Daniel Chalmers ropes Steele into an old scam, where Steele pretends to be the new Duke of Rutherford. Steele's reaction to this shows how far he's come, and how honest he's become over time.

At the same time, Laura has become more sensitive to his murky past, and his attempts to overcome his criminal past. Sure, Zimbalist and Brosnan disliked each other in real life, but they had electric chemistry in many of these episodes. And Mildred (Doris Roberts) gradually becomes less of a maternal figure, and more of an equal to her younger cohorts.

This season also has returning characters like Daniel Chalmers and Rocky Sullivan, and several new ones like Mulch, a bumbling entrepreneur who is always seeking the Big Moneymaker. Virginia Mayo, Dorothy Lamour and Lloyd Nolan also appear as themselves in one episode, and appear to be having lots of fun.

The third season of ""Remington Steele"" is steele solid and entertaining, with more exploration of the mystery detective, and quite a bit more comedy.",1137283200,79,2731,4.986813186813187

2502253,5,B000E6ESC6,"In his pre-James Bond days, Pierce Brosnan took on the character of gumshoe  Remington Steele. In this third season of the popular TV series, Steele investigates and solves more crimes with help from boss Laura Holt (owner of Remington Steele Detective Agency). Sparks fly between this dynamic duo before,during,and after they eventually solve each crime. It is easy to tell that there is a real connection between them as they flirt with each other as they investigate each caper! As the old saying goes, they don't make them like this anymore! Thumbs up from me for Remington Steele!",1380844800,,585,4.969387755102041

2502279,5,B000E6ESC6,"Season three should have been it, while the chemistry is great. You can tell that everybody expected this to be the last season, it ends with Laura in Remington's apartment. Only it's empty, like season one and two. There's plenty of action, actually. Season three Mildred Krebbs gets to do more in this season, they were trying to get around and really show off Los. Angeles. Now they had introduced a character earlier, Major Descoine, I found it to be a shame that they never gave him more than two episodes, because he really stole the show. As I've said before, a great season. The chemistry is there, and some more of Remington's past is brought to light. And seeing as how Pierce almost Got to Play James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"", they expected this to be the last season. But the fans wanted more of Remington Steele, and soooooooo. They got it.",1373328000,,859,4.584415584415584

2502281,4,B000E6ESC6,I had the complete set of this series but the third season was stolen. I purchased this as a replacement and it doesn't quite match the others. The previous format had separate cases for each disk with a synopsis of each episode on the back of its respective case. This one has all the disks in one box and there are no synopses. Makes it difficult looking for a specific episode.,1361318400,,380,4.366197183098592

2502284,5,B000E6ESC6,"Watching Stephanie and Pierce in action was just one of the joys of this series.  Being a woman, I was enthralled with the fashion parade on this show.  The costumes designed for Stephanie were just gorgeous.  My eyes were dancing through every episode!  I always came away feeling like I'd been on vacation!",1358208000,,308,4.754716981132075
2502285,5,B000E6ESC6,"I got this product on sale, so the price was well within my budget.  In fact, I was able to buy the entire series.  The delivery time was exact, and the shows are unforgettable!  I got this a present for my aunt who grew up watching the dashing Pierce Brosnan and the elegant Stephanie Zimbalist match wits as they solve mystery after mystery.  Watching these shows brought back such great memories for her; she loves it.  I, on the other hand, am very glad to have given her the means to enjoy watching a show that had brought her much joy.

This set is a great gift for any mystery fan, particularly those who like some adventure and romance mixed in with the mystery.  I think that the main characters for this show might have been the prototype for shows like Castle and Bones where the main characters match wits with realistic and well-written dialogue as well as wise humour.

Whether you get this set on sale or not, it is definitely worth every dime.",1358121600,,959,4.44
2502286,5,B000E6ESC6,I had never heard of Remington Steele until a couple months ago and I fell in love with the story!  I was watching seasons 1 and 2 for free on Hulu until select episodes weren't available in season 3.  This is just what I was looking for.  The cheapest I could get for it was right here at Amazon. ;) It comes with commentaries and extra interviews and things that are really fun to watch as well. :),1357948800,,400,4.102564102564102

delightful advertures.",1354665600,,111,4.55
2502321,5,B000E6ESC6,This is the only one in the series I have bothered to buy and that was because of the superb Nancy Stafford episode Man of Steele.  Nancy steals the show from what is always a good cast.  Of course Pierce went on to be a very good James Bond and Doris Roberts was tops in the Raymond series.  She still pops up in films stealing her scenes.  Makes you wonder what ever happened to Stephanie Zimbalist.,1352332800,,401,4.2368421052631575
2502322,5,B000E6ESC6,"I am a big fan of the Remington Steele series.  After watching it for a long time while it was still showing regularly on TV, I began taping it to VHS when I found channels re-running it.  I had a lot of tapes.  I then discovered Columbia House had it on VHS, so I bought a couple of those.  They were a waste of money.  When I started seeing old shows come out on DVD, I started looking for my favorite.  I am very happy with the entire set which I have had for awhile now.  Seasons 1 - 3 are excellent as everyone here knows.  Seasons 4 & 5 which came bundled for me are worth it for the fans.  Definitely watch all the other seasons first though.

Remington Steele Seasons 1 - 3: Excellent show
Remington Steele Seasons 4 - 5: Very good

Remington Steele is Steele Red Hot after all these years! (I couldn't help myself.)",1326067200,,824,4.119496855345912
2502323,5,B000E6ESC6,"Hardly any tweaks were needed for Season 3, as the show rolled along like a well-oiled machine. Laura & Remington still struggled with their double-edged business/romantic relationship; and actress Doris Roberts had, by now, settled comfortably into the Mildred Krebs role by showing her comedic flair as well as the tough & tender duality of her character. The season began with a typically stylish episode (""Steele At It"") as Remington returned to a bit of his past as a thief, stealing a jewel-encrusted dagger for a friend...and in true screwball fashion, managing to get Laura & Mildred involved! This was truly the peak season for the show as the cast & crew cooked up some very diverse & entertaining plots. ""Second Base Steele"" had Laura & Remington posing as ball players (Laura, a natural; Steele, hopelessly inept) to catch a killer; ""Steele Your Heart Away"" had Remington revisiting his Irish roots...and getting amnesia (a deftly fine comic performance from Pierce Brosnan); ""A Pocketful of Steele"" had Remington (once again) brushing up against his past when he befriends a young pickpocket (remember the curly-haired, impish child star Meeno Peluce?); ""Blue-Blooded Steele"" reunited Steele with his old pal, the charming con Daniel Chalmers (Stephanie Zimbalist's real life father Efrem, reprising his role) in a royal caper which infuriated Laura; ""Lofty Steele"" had someone tampering with Laura's digs to find a hidden treasure (they went as far as throwing Laura in a padded cell at a mental hospital, just to get her out of the way; BTW, a terrific performance from Ms. Zimbalist); and even Mildred took the spotlight in ""Hounded Steele"", finally revealing her personal life (poignantly) outside the office. There were familiar faces galore passing through the agency. Some on the verge of stardom (John Larroquette, Geena Davis, Jean Smart, Judith Light), and others legendary (Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford...and from my fave ""Cast in Steele"": Dorothy Lamour, Lloyd Nolan & Virginia Mayo).
And that's just a handful of the episodes I remember well---but honestly, they're all good.
As usual, 20th Century Fox did a fine job packaging these episodes. Included is the dandy featurette ""Steele Trio"", profiling the three cast members & their characters.
Like Steele reminiscing about old movies, this DVD set brings back fond memories!",1297382400,,2350,5.252659574468085
2502324,4,B000E6ESC6,"I already had the set of DVD's for Remington Steele season 3, but side-1 of disk-1 made my DVD player vibrate and make a strange noise.  I figured it was a manufacturing defect, so I bought this new set of season-3 in a different package. Strangely enough, the new side-1 of disk-1 does the same thing - it makes my DVD player vibrate and make noise just like the other disk. There must be some special pattern in the track recording that makes the head in the DVD player work extra hard to follow it. Side-2 has no problem, so it is not balance a problem with the disk itself. We like Remington Steele a lot, so we replay all the disks for all 5 seasons many times.",1288656000,,666,4.203125

I also read that some of the music in other episodes has changed, but I didn't notice it myself.  Steele Trying was incredible in its original airing and the A&E reruns, expressions all timed to match the music, now its nothing special and occasionally the expressions seem stupid as they are out of context.

Laura is always the one who finally solves the crime, which as the only official private eye she should, but Steele offers class and mystery himself as well as expertise as a successful cat burglar. This is Pierce Brosnan before fame and Bond, and it proves that he is worthy of following in Cary Grant's footsteps as both a romantic lead and a competent comedic actor.

I even used to lie and say I had never seen it if it was a repeat.  In college, the best gift I got were VCR recordings of these shows from A&E that my mother made for me, actually pausing out commercials.  When the DVDs were given to me by my husband I thought I was in heaven.  I was right.  These are so wonderful!  I can watch them over and over and they fit in so nicely with every other Brosnan DVD I own.  I love it when I have an excuse to curl up in front of the TV now!  If you have ever enjoyed Remington Steele you should absolutely buy these in a second!  The quality is great, the shows have no grainy qualities, and they are so much better than my worn out video tapes!",1162512000,,808,3.8780487804878048
2502376,5,B000E6ESC6,"SEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots.  All around a great opening season for a classic show.

SEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments.  The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.

SEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons.  It's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting.  The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.  Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual ""Gumshoe"".  It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons.

The good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them.  I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I've seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4 & 5), even though I have not yet watched them (I'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).

One MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc.  One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax.  It's too bad that they don't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD's for years of non-skipping enjoyment.  The same disc didn't have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States, but still skipped from time to time.

Overall Show Rating: ***** (5 Stars)

Overall Disc Rating: *** (3 Stars)",1157932800,5,2023,4.593314763231198
2502407,5,B000E6ESC6,"Season 3 finds the beloved couple detective show reaching new heights . . . and unforunately a handful of lows!  There are no major changes to the format or cast this year.  The only change is that the pair are now finding themselves in many more exotic locales than just L.A (2 out-of-town in San Fran and Vegas, and 6 out-of-country in Mexico, Malta, Ireland, and England).

As I said, there are a few misfires in this season, including what may be the most annoying and embarrasing episode of the series, STRONGER THAN STEEL, in which Laura tries to clear the man who played a super hero on TV during her childhood.  The whole Atomic Man bit with its weak attempt to recreate the then burgeoning sci-fi / comic convention craze just comes off as a laughable spoof, and among so many fine episodes, it sticks out like a sore thumb.

Also painful are episodes that include athletes (Whitey Ford and Micky Mantle) and actors (Dorothy Lamour, Virginia Mayo, and Lloyd Nolan) playing themselves.  Nothing is worse than actors or athletes trying to ""be themsevles.""  The one with the actors is particularly bad, as it is obvious they pulled these three out of retirement with a giant wad of cash - it is clear the actors think the script is rubbish (and it is, with some of the LAMEST lines given to them) and as such they put NO effort into their lifeless roles.  The athletes - well, there is a reason they are swinging bats instead of winning oscars!!

But, these few low points aside, there are also some FANTASTIC episodes, such as Steele's bout with amnesia in which he becomes a movie-trivia spouting fool while trying to remember why he is in Ireland - the pair trying to protect two clueless singing-telegram girls - Steele being attacked by cooks who think he is a ruthless restaurant critic - and Steele trying to reach out to a young street pick-pocket, in whom he sees the child he once was.

But two episodes this season stand out as ""all-time best"" candidates.  The first is DICED STEELE which chronicles Steel attempting to bankrupt a suspected thief at a game of cards to lure him into betting the merchandise he stole.  Of course, Steele LOSES the game AND the $150,000 dollars the insurance company loaned him!  This sends the two off to Vegas to try to recover both money AND merchandise.  Meanwhile, a relentless investigator from the insurance company stumbles upon Steele's shady past, and thus we are introduced to Norman Keyes, who would return several times in season 4, always nipping at Steele's heels!

The other stand-out is STEELE IN THE CHIPS - an episode co-written by Zimbalist herself, and so nearly a screw-ball comedy that the network was hesistant to air it for a long time.  It concerns several people going to lethal means to procure or destroy the recipe for a 1-calorie chocolate chip cookie, and includes an extended chase in the end taken straight from the playbook of IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD!  This episode also brings us an early glimpse of Geena Davis (sporting a nice eighties-style Tennis outfit!!)

Season 3 was definitely the show at its zenith.  While many great episodes are still to come in Season 4, they just never were quite as good as they were here!  Buy and enjoy!!",1156464000,3,3230,4.653169014084507
2502408,5,B000E6ESC6,"A brilliant & literate, show with great acting by Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan.  The stories are wonderfully written and the directors excellent.  Ms. Zimbalist and Mr. Brosnan have a wonderful chemistry and are great foils for one another.  Brosnan's ability at physical comedy is unsurpassed.  Ms. Zimbalist's bravery at doing everything is unsurpassed.  The two can act and make interesting choices in everything they do.  Michael Gleason created a great show with great characters.  This is my favorite show and I wish they could have done more of them.  I must admit the only disappointment was the last episodes in Season 5 when they brought in Jack Scalia.  It wasn't worth Pierce Brosnan's loosing the 'Bond' role and the writers lost their way about the lead characters relationship and conflicts.  I wrote a better last screenplay called ""Steele Dreaming of a Holt Christmas,"" which was funny and left everyone in tact, including Efram Zimbalist, Jr. as Daniel Chalmers, a terrific character that we were cheated of.  I can't say enough about the intelligent and brilliant leads, producers, writers, directors, stunt people, camera people, costume and set designers and all involved in this unsurpassed comedy/drama.  Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant!  Buy it at once and enjoy over and over again.

Thank you.

2502409,4,B000E6ESC6,"As has been pointed out, there is a scarcity of extras, and the Tony Bennett song in ""Steele Trying"" is missing. However, there is one more musical problem; the missing music in ""Springtime for Steele."" The credits open with the character Rocky Sullivan singing the words of ""Hooray for Hollywood,"" but that's not the music. Although the show had the music for ""Hooray for Hollywood"" even in syndication, it's been replaced on the DVD with a horrible tune with the wrong tempo that actually fights against Rocky's singing. It's painful to listen to it!

This is a terrific DVD set. The only reasons I can't give it five stars are the lack of extras, the missing Tony Bennett song, and the missing ""Hooray for Hollywood"" music. I wish they'd been as successful in getting all the music rights as were the producers of the ""Moonlighting"" DVDs.",1153872000,6,841,4.760273972602739

2502411,5,B000E6ESC6,"The only thing I didn't like was that the Tony Bennett songs in the ""Steele Trying"" episode were replaced with one song by some other singer.  The reruns of the show that aired on A&E in the 90's had the original songs (so why not the DVD) and each had lyrics that reflected what was happening. I had no where else to complain about this as the FOX TV on DVD site appears to have no forum.

Not sure, but I also think that pocket watch did not play the correct irish tune in the ""Steele Your Heart Away"" ep, it should have been - When Irish Eyes are smiling

Otherwise the show is excellent as always.",1149379200,5,601,4.119658119658119
2502412,5,B000E6ESC6,"I thoroughly agree with the many reviewers who have praised this release and Remington Steele in general. I've been watching TV from its early days in the 1950s through the present and am convinced that Remington Steele was as good as general audience TV gets. No its not Shakespeare, but I don't think that most of us who watch TV really want weekly doses of Shakespeare. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and third seasons (as well as later seasons not yet available on DVD) even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. If you are a fan of Remington Steele you've probably already bought the DVDs of the first two seasons and you'll love this third season too. If you've never seen Remington Steele or have forgotten how good this show was, please do yourself a favor and get this DVD set now. And, like so many other Remington Steele fans, I beg the studio to give us the remaining seasons on DVD as quickly as possible.",1146960000,8,1248,4.65158371040724
2502413,5,B000E6ESC6,"There should be separate star ratings for dvds--one rating for the show itself and one for the dvd special features. I can't bear to give the third season of Remington Steele any less than 5 stars, but the dvd special features have a lot to be desired.

The show itself is as delightful as ever. The witty banter and clever but light-hearted mysteries that characterized the series are all back in full force in the third season. And the writers continue to string us along with Laura and Mr. Steele's relationship, as Steele's attempts to entice Laura into a romantic vacation are constantly thwarted, often by Laura's own fear and skepticism. Although the pseudo love affair is a bit of a tease, the show continues to charm me as much as it did when I was an adolescent.

A few reviewers have mentioned that RS goes on location a lot in this season, which is usually a sign that a show is jumping the shark. However, that is not the case with this season. The on-location episodes are some of my favorites, especially the ones in Las Vegas and San Francisco. And the show continues to stay grounded in Los Angeles despite a fair amount of traveling. (As I recall, when the show finally did jump, the episodes were on location.)

My only complaints about the Season 3 dvds are related to the special features. The set includes three featurettes-""'Steele  Trio' Revealing Character Profiles,"" ""The Baking of Steele in the Chips,"" and ""Steele Michael""-and three episode commentaries: Michael Gleason, Doris Roberts, and writer Jeff Melvoin on ""Diced Steele""; Michael Gleason and writers John Wirth, Brad Kern, and Jeff Melvoin on ""Now You Steele It, Now You Don't""; and Michael Gleason and Stephanie Zimbalist on ""Steele in the Chips.""

The problem is that none of the people interviewed or doing commentaries has seen the show for 20 years. This is certainly understandable, but why don't the producers of the dvds give them a few episodes to watch ahead of time to jog their memories so they will have more intelligent and interesting things to say? This lack of preparation is especially a problem on the episode commentaries because none of the people commenting have seen the episodes they're supposed to be talking about, and they can't follow the plot at the same time that they're talking. So it ends up with commentary that has almost nothing to do with anything going on on the screen. Also, Michael Gleason tends to tell the same stories over and over again, so if you have the Season 1 and Season 2 dvd sets, be prepared to hear anecdotes for the third, fourth, or fifth time. And the #1 sin of dvd commentaries-the repetitive praising of actors-gets committed over and over.

Not that the special features aren't worth watching. The featurettes are pretty interesting. It's nice that they were able to get all three of the actors for interviews. And the commentaries have a few interesting tidbits if you can stand to sit through all the rambling. One very nice treat is that we get to hear a lot more from Stephanie Zimbalist than in previous season sets, particularly in the commentary and mini-feature on the cookie episode, which she co-wrote with a longtime friend who later went on to be hired as a staff writer on the show. I have to admit that, despite my childhood crush on her, I never thought I would like SZ much in real life, but on the commentary she is quite charming and has a lot of interesting things to say. There is also another guy (can't remember which one) on the ""Now You Steele It, Now You Don't"" commentary who keeps trying to steer the conversation toward something relevant and occasionally succeeds.

I just wish they would put a little more thought into it if they're going to bother doing the extra features. It would also be nice if they addressed some of the issues and challenges they faced putting the dvds together. For example, all the music they had to cut. Also, I wonder why they chose to put the episodes on the dvd in the order they were aired instead of the order they were filmed. The current order removes all continuity from the development of Laura and Mr. Steele's relationship. I know the fact that I care about that makes me a big geek, but hey, geeks who sit around watching dvd commentaries are their audience, and they should be aware of that.",1146268800,11,4308,4.66798418972332

My only complaint is this -- the San Francisco ep. from season three, ""Steele Trying,"" is missing the original Tony Bennett tunes.  I understand that those music rights must have been very costly, but it's such a loss.  The original music was elegant, fitting, and sublime.  The replacement is just schlock.",1146096000,9,508,4.781609195402299
2502416,5,B000E6ESC6,"Season Three was the best season of the show.  Why?  Because of all the locations they filmed in that year.  Episodes were shot on the Riviera in France, on Malta, England, Ireland, Mexico, San Francisco and Las Vegas.

All this extra expense made the show even classier.

Steele's mysterious past plays a larger role in this season than before, as he is often seen trying to unravel the story of his own life.

The humorous episodes play very well in this season, especially ""Steele in the Chips"".

I won't on more about the show itself, because I've said it all in my reviews of the first two seasons, but I highly recommend Season Three even above the others.

As for the dvd's, my copies are in top shape, and they have some very interesting behind the scenes stories once again.

8106748,5,B000E6ESC6,"Remington Steele was a charming detective show where a rogish mystery man, Remington Steele (Piers Brosnan) unwelcomely inserted himself into a detective agency owned and run by a very sharp lady, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist). Holt, unsure that clients would warm to a female detective, had set the agency up with the premise that a man (Remington Steele) actually owned it, but was never around. In the first episode, Piers Brosnan discovered this dodge and assumed the identity Holt had created for her non-existent ""boss"".

The general bent of the show was that Steele's street smarts often trumped Holt's technical expertise in solving cases, although they mixed it up enough so that the viewer generally didn't know who was on the right track. Steele and Holt often had conflicting takes on the ultimate solution of a case.

By season three, Holt's original partner and secretary were history, and Doris Robert's had joined the cast as the firm's secretary. She often performed more of a role in investigating a case than your normal secretary would. By this time, the burgeoning but sputtering romance between Steele and Holt had picked up considerable steam.

This was the role that kept Brosnan out of the James Bond movies for quite a few years. He would have had the two movies that Timothy Dalton ultimately performed in, plus there was a break of several years then until Brosnan actually did appear as Bond.

This was one of our favorite TV series of all time. It's got mystery plus lots of light comedy and romance.",1489190400,,1533,4.9073359073359075
