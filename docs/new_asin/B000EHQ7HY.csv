2518733,4,B000EHQ7HY,"Kevin Noland makes a fine debut in both writing and directing this colorful, insightful, low-key exploration of the age old Apollonian Dionysian conflict.  For a first film, despite some minor technical glitches (overexposed photography at key moments, a soundtrack that eats the dialogue before it is audible), Noland proves himself a keen observer of life, of philosophy, and of character studies.  He is definitely an artist to watch.

Chris McKinley (Joshua Jackson in yet another fine performance) has just finished college and is ending his summer holiday in Spain with only three days before he returns to an important corporate position in the US. He is traveling with two friends, Ryan (Timm Sharp) and Michelle (Ruthanna Hopper) who are lovers, and they end their holiday in Pamplona, Spain just as the festival of the bulls is happening. Chris' backpack is stolen and with it his passport, credit cards, all semblances of civilization..., and he plunges out of despair into the wildness of the running of the bulls.  He meets two important influences: American expatriate bar owner Riccardo who spouts forth 'live for the moment' concepts, and the beautiful and intoxicating  Adela (Leonor Varela) who embodies all that is fascinating about the beauty of Spain.  The four young people set out on a hike to fly fish, carouse, and live with nature, and this excursion into Spain's gorgeous countryside affects the foursome: Ryan and Michelle decide to part ways and Chris and Adela...well, the story has a fine ending!

Noland respects the viewer and offers his tale of discovery with minimal dialogue, some terrific music, exciting footage of the running of the bulls and bullfights, and some hallucinogenic views of nature.  Both Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela light up the screen.  Ruthanna Hopper (Dennis Hopper's daughter) not only acts well, she also has been part of this project since its inception, is one of the producers, and adds a credibility to the story.  So despite the occasional technical flaws, this is a little film of joy, a celebration of discovery the important facts of living.  Grady Harp, May 06",1148947200,12,2132,5.097701149425287
2518734,5,B000EHQ7HY,"Anyone who travels internationally will get it, those who don't travel may miss the internal combustion of excitement this movie brings to the viewer.  Director/writer Kevin Noland's first feature depicting the pensiveness of a young graduate on his first trip abroad to Spain truly captures the raw emotion and confusion that come with choosing life's path, or letting life's path choose you.",1143763200,19,393,5.338709677419355

Kevin Noland is a superb Writer and Director.  The casting was perfect!

2518737,2,B000EHQ7HY,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Americano/dp/B000EHQ7HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Americano</a>&nbsp;is one of those movies that should be tailor made for me.  I've been to Spain several times, I love traveling, and coming of age films definitely interest me.  I am also more forgiving of slow moving films than most.  I love to watch characters and story elements unfolding beneath the surface.

And yet this movie left me wanting so much more.  Instead of slow, imperceptible character changes, we have one-dimensional characters whose motivations are not portrayed or conveyed convincingly, if at all.  The pacing of the movie is brutal.  Rather than a slowly developing drama we get a painfully slow film that feels much longer than it is.  When you consider the star power and talent of this cast, that's pretty disappointing.

There are some positives.  The camera work is actually really nice.  And the cinematography really does convey the feeling of Spain and all of the excitement of the *Running of the Bulls* made famous by writers like Hemingway.  All of the actors seem very capable for their roles.  But at times their lines seem in need of re-writes and a few of the takes could have definitely been re-done.

*** MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD ***

Joshua Jackson plays Chris McKinley, a college graduate trekking across Europe with his friend Ryan, played by Timm Sharp, and Ryan's girlfriend Michelle, played by Ruthana Hopper.  The journey is set up as a ""last hurrah"" before Chris has to return home to his stereotypical *dream job*.

There are early signs of predictability in the writing.  Chris idiotically gets his backpack stolen with all his crucial documents, which is the kind of easy plot element travel movies are made of. Of course they go to see a bull-fight and there is an extremely forced argument about the brutality of the event versus the tradition.  If you think bull-fighting is brutal, why would you purchase a ticket to go to a bull-fight?

Then things take a turn from the predictable towards the cliche as Chris has a beautiful Spanish girl fall into his lap.  Adela, played by Leonor Varela, is a character that is not really fleshed out well with lines, but the actress does give her believability. Yet it's never really convincingly conveyed why Varela's character would even be attracted to Jackson.  It's difficult to see what, if anything, she sees in Chris.  It's hard not to think her instantaneous desire for him is little more than the gratuitous conceit of an American writer.  Contrary to popular belief, foreign women are not lustfully waiting for the American men to arrive.

Dennis Hopper's role of Riccardo reaches an even baser level of cliche.  The expatriate American who has somehow acquired a club in the heart of the city seems to have nothing better to do than schooling young Americans on the ways of the world.  Excessively flowery and vague riddles are soon to follow.

We are supposed to believe that these romantic characters cause Chris to rethink his life. Yet even with all his talents, Joshua Jackson cannot convey those subtle changes in a character that is written with the dimensions of a blank sheet of paper.

We are also supposed to believe that Chris actually starts to re-think his plans of returning home for his career versus staying on to take the *road less traveled*.  Yet I'm sure you can guess the end of this very predictable tale.

At one point, Chris stops to watch a street performer and stands there smiling dumbly.  Then without warning, he erases the smirk from his face and moves on.  This scene would be forgettable except that it sums up the sentiment I had with this movie as a whole.  I can kind of smile at the entertaining yet unoriginal story, yet long before it was over I was ready to move on.

I really think there might be a very good film hidden in there, but to get to it you would probably have to edit out a few characters and do some major re-writes on certain sections.  I understand the reasons for including the best-friend and girlfriend characters, but they simply don't have enough good lines to warrant inclusion in this story.  In fact they have several poor scenes that weaken the movie instead of strengthen it.  Cutting those characters by itself would have gained this movie an additional star.

It's difficult to know how much talent Kevin Noland has based upon this debut.  The easy conclusion to draw is that he may have bitten off more than he could chew.  Perhaps if he would have focused on directing and had a dedicated screenwriter, they could have cleaned up his script a little and added more character development to support his plot line.

As with most films, I actually subjected myself to multiple viewings of this just to see if there was something I wasn't giving them credit for.  While this film does have some nice features about it, by and large it is not very effective.  I would not be opposed to watching bits and pieces of it were it ever to air on TV, but this is not a film I can recommend purchasing.

Joshua Jackson does well enough with what he is given, but Varela is the real stand-out.  None of it is enough to overcome a story that is not convincing and characters that are as wooden as Riccardo's teeth. Some re-writes or deletions could have made the character development more convincing.

This movie may be worth seeing if you love photography and scenic vistas of Spain.  Otherwise, the pacing is so slow that it's hard to really enjoy this movie.

2518738,1,B000EHQ7HY,"Joshua Jackson and Leonor Varela did a good job with what they were given, which was basically a film that lacked a plot. This film was painful to watch. The storyline was boring boring boring. I could not wait for it to end. The scenery is beautifully and the cinematography is not bad, but the plot is pointless.",1202774400,,314,4.431034482758621
2518739,4,B000EHQ7HY,"I saw AMERICANO in the theater (it played for exactly one week in a small art-houre here in NY, and there was absolutely no advertizing in the local media) and now have bought the DVD. To be sure it will not be everyone's cup of tea. It does not have much of a plot, true - but then again neither does Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME. What we have are a series of vignettes hung around the vestigal plot of: confused, naieve American boy (Jackson) meets clever, world-wise, and a slightly wild & eccentric Spanish woman (Varela). The chemistry between Jackson & Varela is real. I think as a romantic comedy it works quite well, and I thnk it's a great film for couples to watch together - preferably by candle-light, with some wine and some tapas snacks on hand. Tim Sharp & Ruthanna Hopper were fine as the ""comic"" couple played against the serious (Jackson & Varela) couple. I'll admit the Dennis Hopper character was a bit of a problem: his portentious oracular pronouncements (""Be wary!"") were a bit hard to swallow. But that's a minor complaint. The cinematagrophy was first rate; the sights & sounds of Spain, of the drunken blow-out that is the running of the bulls are captured quite well indeed. What, for me, made the film completely worthwhile was the presence of beautiful Chilean actress Leonor Varela. She is a fine actress, has proven herself a first rate dramatic actress (the recent INNOCENT VOICES), and now has shown herself to be also a first rate comedic actress. Her fans will want to own this film.",1157068800,5,1521,4.6162361623616235
2518740,4,B000EHQ7HY,"I agree with another reviewer - if you've been there you will get it.  I was in Spain this summer and went to Pamplona and did El Camino de Santiago.  I can see why the lack of an exciting storyline or a twist can disappoint many used to Hollywood cinema.  In the words of Adela, ""Nothing is as predictable as Hollywood"".  This movie is genuine, except for the gorgeous woman.  The footage is excellent, especially the running of the bulls.  I wish they would have shown more of El Camino.  But this movie is not meant to close the loop, just show us the questions that arise in all of us.",1155686400,8,589,4.252252252252252

2518742,4,B000EHQ7HY,"Americano was a very enjoyable movie. A fun, funny and sensuous trek through some of Hemingway's old haunts. It reminded me of my collage days. I immediately wanted to head to Europe and hike through Spain, Italy, France or Croatia. In life sometimes we have to make a decision we will regret later in life . . .

2518743,1,B000EHQ7HY,"Although the running of the bulls was interesting, the torture and killing of one of them was pointless and barbaric.  Since the plot or storyline was a big fat zero, it was meaningless to have included the scenes.  The characters behaved stupidly and were not believable.  The one star is for the scenery and photography.  Sorry, that's the best I could do.",1154304000,2,358,4.725806451612903
2518744,1,B000EHQ7HY,"Movies are always more enjoyable when they have plots.  Unfortunately, this film doesn't have one.  There is no exposition, no drama, no tension (except between the minor characters, not the main ones), no rising action, no conflict, no resoluton of conflict, and no climax.  In one scene, a patron of the club ""Americano"" steals the main character's journal, which is stuffed into his belt in the small of his back.  The main character retrieves it by following the thief into a back room where the club owner played by Dennis Hopper offers him a stiff drink, as if they are old friends.  The main character does not find this to be in the least bit odd and takes the drink.  The theft of the journal has absolutely nothing to do with any of the previous scenes, nor any of the following scenes in this lifeless screenplay.  The film simply moves on to the next meaningless scene.  In one of the few scenes that triggers a viewer's hope that a real plot might emerge, Hopper's character encounters the main character in a urinal.  Hopper looks at him, wags his finger, and warns (for no apparent reason), ""Be wary.""  Is this a hint that some twist will save the film?  Nope.  Nothing happens.  When the end mercifully arrives, the main character decides whether to return home or to continue his stay in Europe.  But there are absolutely no indications that he has been wrestling with this decision.  The movie can be summed up as:  People go to the running of the bulls; main dude meets a babe; they all go to a bull fight; they all go drinking; they all have dinner; they all go swimming; they all go camping; they all go fly fishing; they make love; they go their separate ways. Movie ends.  The biggest intellectual challenge from this film is trying to stay awake to the end.  The actors do a fine job; too bad they are given so little to convey.",1151366400,5,1852,4.51051051051051

Hemingway fans will appreciate and relate, others might not get it. Very relaxing and pretty funny in some spots; youll feel like you're along for the trip. Wish it was on Blu-ray, but the overlooked indies never seem to make it. Btw, if you're easily offended say by, the traditional running of the bulls recreated with pit bulls and midgets, you should probably still watch it!",1522195200,,530,4.53125
8109731,5,B000EHQ7HY,One of my favorite meandering movies. Music is amazing and it really tapped the culture of Spain with actual bullfighting. Technically one would not rate this wandering plot line as poor but that's what the plot line is trying to get across and does with the wandering path the main characters take. A great movie to put on if things are too hectic in ones life. It always soothes.,1506556800,,381,4.536231884057971

8109736,3,B000EHQ7HY,"I give away a few things, so don't read this if you hate spoilers. This movie gives the viewer a good feel for the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, as far as the ever-present nature of the crowds, activities, etc. But, unfortunately the movie overall is listless and meandering. Leonor Varela is marvelous, vivacious, and sexy. She saves the movie. The other acting, apart from Dennis Hopper, is blah. Ruthanna Hopper starts to come alive and then disappears. Joshua Jackson is like a puppy being led everywhere but with no drive of his own. Very little character development. Story line of Americans traveling through Europe forced to make some decisions at their trip's end is good and had potential. But, it was portrayed without conviction. And, give me a break, people in their 20's are alive and passionate with each other. They just don't walk away from a passionate relationship to go walking for a month alone because somebody tells them to. Unbelievable! In real life, the young dude could not have been pried from his new Spanish girlfriend. And, she would not have let him go. With a little more background or character development or twists, this could have been a great movie. But, I have watched it and will now probably give it away. Next time, I will believe the IMDB rating.",1404259200,,1295,4.76

The story is great. The writing is great. The scenery is beautiful. The ending is surprising and powerful and beautiful. The actors and cameraman actually ran with the bulls to get that scene. The Spanish culture depiction is realistic.

This movie is a masterpiece and unbelievably underrated and under-popularized.",1289779200,2,487,5.012345679012346
