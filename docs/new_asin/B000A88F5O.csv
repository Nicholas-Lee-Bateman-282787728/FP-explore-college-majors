8076149,1,B000A88F5O,"I suspect that the folks who wrote the scripts for this thing are the same people who produced the DVS's Amazon is selling us.  Neither the plots nor the DVD's are completed.  The stories lines are left hanging with nothing approaching a logical conclusion.  For instance, our heroine hotel owner and our heroine gunsmith are kidnapped and held in a cabin.  Most of our heroes show up, shot em up, but they let the bad guy ride away never to be heard of again.  They also have our  heroine gunsmith ""gut  shot"" lying, dying on the ground.  No resolution here either.
When they send out the DVD's they have a nonsensical system of sticking the order of the episodes in some order set by a coin toss?
This is a second rate series presented to us in a third rate set of DVD's.  It is a rip off of a great Pulitzer prize novel, and the best TV series ever made.  We did not like it, and we don't rent pigs.",1431820800,2,902,4.222222222222222
8076150,1,B000A88F5O,"The Lonesome Dove Series is confusing and can make you spend extra money or purchase DVD's that you already have.  For example.  I purchased Lonesome Dove, Complete Series, Volume 1.  So when I ordered The series Vol 5, I thought it was a continuation of The complete Series Volume 5, but in actuality it is the 5th series of the Lonesome Dove Complete Series, Volume 1.

I am looking for Lonesome Dove, Complete Series, Volume 2",1413936000,3,429,4.605263157894737
8076151,5,B000A88F5O,"Lonesome Dove the series  was one of the best westerns that I have ever watched.  It was a little confusing in relating this series to the other parts of the story because in the other parts (Lonesome Dove the movie and Commanche Moon) The characters are played by different persons.  All in All, I highly recommend ""the series"" and found it necessary to buy all of the entire set.",1203897600,3,381,4.492753623188406
