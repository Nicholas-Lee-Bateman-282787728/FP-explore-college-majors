8216006,2,B000V02Y9E,"THIS DVD IS GREAT TO SEE THE OLD CADILLAC COMMERCIALS AND ROAD TESTING AND DEMOSTRATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT CADILLACS BUT THATS ABOUT IT. THE PICTURE AND SOUND OF THIS DVD IS TERRIBLE. THE SOUND IS VERY LOW NO MATTER HOW HIGH YOU TRUN UP THE TV AND THE PICTURE THROUGHOUT THE DVD IS HARD TO SEE(BLURRY,TRACKING OFF, AND TOO BRIGHT AT TIMES. YOU WOULD EXPECT FOR OLD FOOTAGE TO HAVE BAD SPOTS WHERE THE PICTURE WOULD BE OFF BUT, THATS WHY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REMASTERED. NOT WORTH THE MONEY IN ITS CURRENT STATE BUT IF THIS DVD WAS CLEANED UP IT WOULD BE A GREAT BUY. GOOD INFO PICTURES,& FILM FOOTAGE, BUT TOO HARD TO SEE AND HEAR.",1312761600,,629,4.294117647058823
