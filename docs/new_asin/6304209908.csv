808092,5,6304209908,"Of all the works of Ken Burns that I have in my library, ""The West"" in my opinion is his masterpiece to america. The only problem that I have with this film now is that it is still not available on DVD. Mr. Burns? We are waiting.",1049500800,6,229,3.893617021276596
808093,5,6304209908,"This is the best documentary I've ever seen.  Peter Coyote's narration is wonderful.  The skill with which the story of the westward-moving Americans is interwoven with the tragic story of the displaced Native Americans is truly amazing.  The beautiful scenery of the western U.S. is intermingled with photographs from the past.  Despite having learned the history of the West every year in school growing up, I learned many new things watching this documentary.  It's definitely worth watching.",1034467200,18,495,5.376623376623376
808094,5,6304209908,"So where is a DVD release!??  Unique, amazing, massive project thoroughly documenting the expansion of the United States into the vast territories of the American WEST. Brutally honest, sympathetic insight into the fall of the many Native American peoples... some of the material is painful, sometimes bleak, but an absolute MUST SEE for any feeling person with even a passing interest in the history of America. Outstanding photography and the classic Ken Burns look & feel (executive & senior producer), but with director Stephen Ives' own insightful point-of-view. This series ranks right along side Burns' ""Civil War"" in scope and depth, IMHO. See it anyway you can, then demand the set on DVD! (DVD not available at this writing).",1029196800,4,735,5.176470588235294
808095,5,6304209908,"With all the years of American History we got shoved down our throats, none of it made an impression on me like this documentary series.  I borrowed this boxed set from a friend, and together with my son, got a history lesson I'll never forget. It makes me ashamed to be a white person in America (at least I can console myself with the fact I'm only second generation).  It's been a while since I viewed it, and would love to own it.  The slaughter of the Buffalo, along with the indigenous people was mind boggling.  The information about the South Western territories was facinating.  One cannot retain so much information in one viewing and it is something that can be viewed over and over again.  When the price goes down, I'll surely add it to my video collection.",992217600,5,770,4.503597122302159
808096,5,6304209908,"I absolutely adore ""The West"".  I have been watching this indispensable film repeatedly since I received it a month ago, and its impact deepens with each viewing.  Man, I wish I had a voice like that of N. Scott Momaday!  I would listen to him read a grocery list.  Anyway, I can hardly write anything about this documentary that has not been written, but I do believe it to be a mesmerizing and terribly enriching experience.",979171200,6,426,4.565789473684211
808097,5,6304209908,"Much like the other great documentary ""The Civil War"" this superb retelling of the story of westwards expansion by Americans and the effects on others already there eg the native Americans and Mexican Californians, is profound. Through biographical sketches taken from the lives of ordinary people as they lived their often hard lives we see the humanity and struggle as well as the worst aspects of human behaviour. The music is ideally chosen representing a reality which captivates as well as the narration itself which also achieves a sense of place and time for the photographs and the interviews with historians and others throughout. There is no better documentary yet made which displays so thoroughly accurately and with real style as it truly was.
I bought the CD of the music because of its beauty. This is a must have video, hopefully its also available in DVD.",975974400,7,873,4.945578231292517
808098,5,6304209908,"Photography breathtaking.  Music spellbinding. The story riveting.  This documetary should be mandatory viewing in every American History class.  True history here - not the whitewashed watered down, self serving  glorification of the conquest of the untamed West.  Here is the story of  America at its genecidal worst; ruthless, murderous, calculating, and  devestating.  And yet this same story shows unimagineable beauty, heroics,  love, and the enevitability of change.  This is undoubtably one of the  most fair tellings of what happened to the West and the people who took it  from the People who loved it.  See it, feel it, and continue to think about  it.",928022400,29,663,5.25
808193,2,6304209908,"While I am not finished watching this, and may not...  I would agree with the other reviews that state that this is Ken Burns only with the name on the box, it only wants to be.

My basic complaint is with the quality of these DVDs, they are just one notch above VHS.  There is jitter in a lot of the moving pans that is just so distracting when you have higher expectations for a PBS production.

I got this at it's all time low price, and now the normal price is much higher.  I would recommend 90% plus of purchasers pass on this.  Maybe used could be worth it?",1511049600,,564,4.081818181818182

808197,5,6304209908,"Never has so much history been in one place as this DVD on the early years of our America. But at times it is very sad to hear and read our history as to what was done to our native Indians. I  am ashamed to say the least. Price is the most I have ever paid for  DVD, but for all the hours of teaching it is worth every cent and would pay even more knowing now what was given. Buy this and pass it on it will always be enjoyed in the years to come with the many photos and story's.",1501459200,,481,3.7058823529411766
808198,2,6304209908,"Also disappointed as others have said, with way too much emphasis on settlers dominating Native Americans as they pushed Westward. Like the documentary stated at its opening -- there's plenty of shame to go around to all peoples in our history of expansion. Stories of invasion and conquering are not unique to the North American continent.  But cruel reality is that might determines ""right."" More importantly, the fact that stories of Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp are often embellished does not negate the fact that these men existed  but are not mentioned at all. Nor are entire states like Arizona, and New Mexico. Nine hours of documentary slogging thru commentaries by academic ""experts"" and a musical theme of 7 repititious notes may drive you a little crazy.  I somehow waited 20 years to see this documentary but wish I had waited another 20. Thank you Amazon, for making this available to Prime members for free, because I wouldn't have wanted to purchase this one.",1498435200,2,975,4.8969696969696965

The historians are in the class of the wonderful educational ones used in the epic Ken Burns film: The Civil War. I suggest that if you have that, you might want to see that before this one. Although this shows some of the things that led to that war, this shows what was going on in the parts of the country that were ""out west"".

We should all be thankful to the filmmakers for taking the time for making such a great film. And the product was delivered ahead of schedule in great shape....",1469664000,3,326,4.803571428571429
808328,3,6304209908,"This film was produced by Stephen Ives in the Ken Burns documentary style.  (Burns was the ""Executive Producer.)  It was done in 1996, roughly half way through Burns' documentary career (as of this year, 2016).  It exhibits both the strengths and weaknesses of the Burns style.  Weaknesses include a severe need of better editing - it's some 25% longer than will really hold your interest. It's also somewhat uneven.  For example it goes into interesting detail about the evolution of the conflict between the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes, against the white settlers and the US Cavalry.  But it doesn't end the story, it just stops.  It doesn't describe (or even mention) the Battle of the Little Bighorn, apparently assuming everyone already knows about that.

On the other hand, it does present a wide sweep of a critical part of our history.  And a real strength of this documentary is the detailed and sensitive way it presents the process of how the white settlers (putting it bluntly) really screwed American Indians. Most folks know that in general, but not necessarily in specifics.  You need to understand this if you're a US citizen.

Note that having been produced in 1996 it's a full screen video, not wide screen and does not include subtitles. Also note that the documentary Burns produced a year later, ""Lewis and Clark"", is a significantly better documentary.",1469491200,6,1392,4.982683982683983

I realize most Americans have been deceived by our childhood history books, and this series seems to want to balance the truth by showing all the negative actions by the white settlers who headed West any any cost. I quit watching after episode four.  I felt the documentary wanted to convey there were no good people who settled in the West. I was depressed and disgusted after watching this. Were there any good people who had good motives for settling in the West or were they ALL greedy SOB's who stole everything from the Native Americans and Mexicans? The photographs featured were repetitive and dismal. Did they all represent the people in the story or were some just old photos from the West?  I thought the best part featured were the historian's commentary. I only wish the visuals matched their words.",1458950400,9,930,4.63030303030303

808406,5,6304209908,"Wonderful long form documentary. This does give more time to the Europeans than Indigenous history but is more even handed than most historical documentaries. This is similar in all regards to Ken Burns more famous ""Civil War"" docuseries.",1454803200,6,238,5.2894736842105265
808407,1,6304209908,"When it comes to the west, there are two sides of the story told. On one hand you got the John Wayne kind of story. Our cowboy or pioneer hero is out to conquer the west, and the indian is presented as a nuisance; an obstacle to be overcome. On the other hand, the white man is presented as racist monster that took the indians land, and destroyed his cultural identity and way of life. In reality, the truth is in the somewhere in the middle. That said, if you are looking for a documentary about the Oregon trail, homesteaders, outlaws and lawmen, the gold rush, indian fights, all the things that come to mind about the west, you'll be disapointed. While some those things are discussed, mostly its about how horrible the white man treated the Indian. In other words, they take the second approach I mentioned. Now, It can't even be disputed that American government treated Native Americans terribly. That is not my problem. My problem is the heavy handed approach this documentary takes to pound into your head that the white man wronged the indians. That is part of story, and shouldn't omitted, all I ask is for balance. In every episode theyll start talking about something interesting, like a man heading to California to take part of the gold rush, or some lady heading to Oregon to spread the gospel, and then its back to the injustice commited against indians. It gets old quick. All the atrocities the indians commited against whites are omitted here. Is it supposed to be ok that they mutilated men, women, and children because that is their culture? This noble savage crap is just that: crap. Also, lets just pretend Indians didn't massacre and subjugate each other before the white man got here. They all smoked peace pipes and hunted buffalo in complete harmony before that despicable white man came along and took their land. PLEASE. They oversimplify a complex issue. These were two completely different cultures that couldnt, and wouldn't, understand each other. Both were equally capable of meeting the other with atrocity or compassion. Again, I'm not saying whites didn't wrong the Native Americans, I'm just saying there needs to be balance.

So, if you want to watch 12hrs of liberals patronizing Native Americans, then this is for you. If you want a fair and balanced view of the west, look elsewhere.",1454630400,20,2327,4.774193548387097

808410,3,6304209908,"I just finished watching this documentary on Netflix. While the series is entertaining and informative, it does suffer from a one sided perspective on the history of the West. There is ample evidence given about the injustices that the Native Americans faced but they are not placed in context. While we hear over and over about broken treaties and slaughters,  very little is said about the wars that Native Americans fought against each other. Surely a documentary that claims to tell the story of the West should have told the story about the terrible wars and slavery that existed amongst Native Americans tribes. If someone that did not know anything about the West  saw this , they would beleive the myth that Native Americans lived in peace before white men arrived. The segments on the Gold Rush, the plight of the Mormons and the Cowboys are in my opinon great and appear to be treated fairly. This is a good series, I plan to use segments in my classes but it is not great because of the reasons stated above.",1450137600,7,1019,4.655555555555556

808574,3,6304209908,"Okay, I don't usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to give my opinion on this. Firstly, I am an historian and have studied history for many years. I really like Burns' documentaries, but below I'm going to list some observations and let you decide how you feel about the documentaries that Ken Burns creates.

1) I researched the political interviewees: every person interviews who holds or held political office is (or was) a member of the Democratic Party. This is true for ALL of Ken Burns' documentaries.

2) Burns fails to leave out violence perpetrated by the Comanche tribe. (Such as the Parker Raid in TX). The Comanche were a nomadic tribe and held territory nearly from Canada to Mexico in the west. They were extremely hostile to other peoples (including neighboring tribes like the Apache's). They were so aggressive that they essentially kept the Spanish from expanding into the southwest. The Comanches ruthless and would often raid school houses and murder children for no apparent reason. Again, these things are left out of the documentary yet they are very important for a full understanding on the development of the American West.

3) The documentary leaves out the full story regarding Custer's last stand. The U.S. Government/Army did not sanction Phil Sheridan or George Custer to ride into the Black Hills. The President (U.S. Grant) understood the Black Hills were sacred to the Indians and did not want to provoke them.

4) President U.S. Grant is portrayed by Burns as an Indian hater. This could not be further from the truth. U.S. Grant was wholly on the side of the Indians and invited them often to the White House for talking. Grant often times tried to convince officials to do whatever they could to benefit the Indian Tribes in the west. He worked very hard to keep peace between whites and the Indians.

BUT... Grant was a Republican, so maybe Burns didn't feel like giving him credit? Grant was an outstanding President but history has treated him very poorly because of the corrupt people who surrounded him.

5) This is a personal one: I would have liked the last episode to touch on the Hetchhetchi Dam, Hoover Dam and the Dust Bowl (and the poor farming techniques that led to the issues.)

This is a good documentary, but it should only be used to help develop interest in the topic of the American West and American History. Do your own research and create your own opinions!",1429056000,16,2425,4.800959232613909
808575,3,6304209908,"Using photographs, beautiful color scenery of the west, and historical narration this film series seeks to document the development of the American west from early Indian times through the 19th century.  As an emotional presentation of one view of history the series is quite successful.  However, as an objective and balanced view of history, it is a failure.  The series seemed fairly authentic and balanced through Disc 3.  However, Discs 4 & 5 took a subtle but very definite skew to the left, not because the events portrayed were untrue, but because of the political bias and historical revisionism that often taints PBS productions.  A great deal of the history of the west was completely omitted.  All balance was abandoned in favor of a liberal political bias that overemphasized all the wrongs committed by the Americans, omitted their good deeds, and presented little or nothing about the depredations of the Indians.  For example, Discs 4 & 5 dealt repeatedly with Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce in the NW because his story engenders the most sympathy.  On the other hand, there was absolutely nothing in the whole series that dealt with the Comanches and the Apaches in the American SW.  The fifty years of Indian conflicts in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona from the 1830s to the 1880s received almost no mention at all in this series, while (for more PC emphasis) the injustices done to the Mexican inhabitants received generous coverage.  The Comanche chief Quanah Parker, and the Apaches Cochise and Geronimo were never mentioned at all, while the photographs and quotes of Chief Joseph were used ad nauseam.

I knew many basic details of the history  the Gold Rush, building the transcontinental railroad, and cattle drives  but experiencing the personal stories with the amazing photos and voices from the past evokes poignance and irony that do not go away.  And sadness.  I grieved again the tragedy of the blacks and the natives, plus the Hispanics and the Chinese, and newly grieved the loss of the buffalo, experiencing as never before the nobility of this animal.

808834,3,6304209908,"Overall I benefited from seeing the great sweep of American history in a few hours of film.  I was amazed to realize how recently all of this occurred.  I'd like to know what role Ken Burns played, if any, besides putting money into it.  It carries tremendous weight, having his name on it, because he has a reputation for honesty.  Is the degree of accuracy in this video worthy of his name?
I was appalled by the degree of ruthlessness, deceit and racism in American history. And though some reviewers have pointed out that the end result of this film is to make you hate what Americans did, feel that Custer had it coming, and want to give the land back to the Indians - what would actually help besides just saying ""this film is PC"" is to provide more accurate information, or a link to more accurate information.  If this film is grievously biased, if this *isn't* the real story, what is? And I don't mean correcting a fact here and there - I mean the substance of the thing. Are the one-star reviewers saying that the cavalry didn't massacre the Indians, men, women and children? That the US government did live up to its treaty obligations? That the Indians started the Indian Wars?  That the people who killed off Northern California's Indians - acorn gatherers and other peaceful types - were justified, and not just out for their land?  It's one thing to provide generalized criticisms, another thing to provide the truth of the matter if this is false. (And one reviewer felt his review said something by just mocking Momaday - pure ad hominem, without a word of substance to the criticism.)
If this isn't the real story of the West -- what is?  Nobody here has to any degree provided that, and I've read all the reviews to date.  And if no one can do so, then I'm left with the conclusion that ""The West"" is essentially accurate as presented; and that the strength of the American pioneer character, the multitude of immigrants who came to the USA at the beginning of the 20th century with nothing but hope and faith and guts, built America on land that had a short time before been wrested ruthlessly from the people who lived here. America has a lot to change in its own national character - including a lot of racism - before it has the moral authority to fulfill its destiny of leading the nations to a just and peaceful world. It is deeply shocking to see how consistently Americans and the American government got it wrong, acted with supreme arrogance and cruelty, in treatment of the original people here.",1390003200,10,2526,4.558498896247241

808838,5,6304209908,"I'm finishing this series for the second time (just finished Civil War again too). It's fascinating, especially for a Californian like myself - est. 1850, baby.

There is so much history gripping the heals of the Wests American character: our love of nature, development, innovation and expansion. The difficulties of creating railroads bisecting an enormous country across countless rolling hills, seas of grass and jagged mountain spines.  Intimate journal excerpts guide the viewer with personal accounts of, say, how the country was so enthusiastic about the gold rush, how that brutally unforgiving prospect of being a gold miner translated directly into populating the western seaboard with incredible haste and established the great American monolith of the West: San Francisco.

The series is unflinching for describing how early Americans treated its natives. The deplorable and disturbing stories of how, for instance, American horsemen murdered native women and children with relentless impunity, echoing the harshest passages of Cormac McCarthy's ""Blood Meridian (Evening Redness in the West)"". It isn't so dark to be unpalatable, although a strange unwaveringly bleak underbelly underscores The West with eyes on manifest destiny and the saddest truth: previous generations stole this land, they murdered and are responsible for the deaths of vast established, sustainable cultures. They ruined our wildernesses with great dispensation in the name of progress, blasted literally from the nozzle of water hose mining, railroads foisted on the backs of hard working Chinese men, the beleaguering dredges of the Civil War spilling all the way to the left coast.

I love the stories about the cowboy and how the first gun laws were fostered in Wyoming, of all places, a resistant blow-back to the drunken lunacy of cattlemen fresh from the drive, pockets filled with pay and reckless with abandon.  This series goes through so much detail and through so many historic accounts, it's impossible to cover it all. Though it's highly edifying and worthy of the 12+ hours it will take to get to end, the following of Chief Joseph's legacy alone will make you feel like he should bare the tender we reserve for our presidents.",1388620800,2,2229,5.3210227272727275

These stories fostered the imagination of every American kid who got a cap pistol and holster for Christmas.

808913,5,6304209908,"I am English and have  had the good fortune only twice to visit the great country of America, once to the Seattle area and another time to Maryland and bordering States.

As my own country has its own rich history I have never considered the history of the American West except what I have seen in cowboy films and the odd documentary but this series is something else.

I just watched it on PBS America and was spellbound: the photography, the narration, the anecdotes and stories of the myriads of people of all different nationalities that shaped the West, all totally enthralling and utterly moving.

This documentary has really fired my imagination about the history of America and the Western frontier and the settlers, immigrants and native Americans that shaped it - and I am now hungry to find out more.

Absolutely captivating.

However, it has made me all too aware of parallels between the way Indians and subsequent waves of immigrants were treated - and I am not pointing the finger at any one ""race"" here... I don't do pc... however, here in England, we are undergoing something similar in terms of being forced into a minority, our own culture and cultural needs disregarded. Just goes to show that this process is continuous. Will there ever truly be peace and integration in the world?

Not while mankind needs to be tribal and to feel it belongs to a particular group... and I am NOT criticising this. It is human nature - as it is in the animal world.. the need to hunt in packs and stick together and defend your territory.

Unfortunately this whole upheaval, constantly shifting tribes, infighting and outfighting, wars and battles, will always be with us. Anyone who thinks there will ever be such a thing as world peace is living in a fool's paradise.

And while ever the Left try to foist upon us the idea that it can ever be any different, those of us who inhabit the real world know it will never be.

Personally I would love to inhabit a world where people co existed in peace and harmony, more than anything I would love to achieve that state.

This series shows us it can never happen... however it is a testament to the courage and fortitude of all those who fight for their existence, their families and for posterity.

As you can see, this is truly a documentary that provokes thought, more, I think, than any other I have ever seen, including the ones produced by my own country, which are often renowned.",1376265600,5,2439,4.62037037037037

809074,1,6304209908,"Well, I looked at the one star reviews before purchasing and thought they were blowing hot air. However, $60 later I find myself agreeing with them.

The West according to Ken Burns, is a revisionist history which takes the phrase ""politically correct"" to mean ""selective historical moments to be presented in a totally biased way"".

Getting away from the ""pc"" issue, the film is ""choppy"" in the extreme with no seeming connection between the 'events' being presented. If you like your history presented 'chronologically' (as I do) then this fails in the extreme.

Now I know the liberal/marxist pc colors Ken Burns wears I will avoid anything else by him.

One final point - before all you pc-ers start flagging this review down please appreciate I understand events do not occur in a vacuum, and that there is more than one side to a story - however, if you're honest you'll admit that more than one side was not given.",1329696000,46,921,4.7375
809075,5,6304209908,"The West may be distantly fronted by Ken Burns but it is more artistic and possesses more of an edge than any Ken Burns' work. Steven Ives collaborated with Burns on The Civil War and Baseball but this documentary is Ives' own.

No matter how much you may have studied the period the series covers you will either find astonishing surprises or fascinating fresh elements to stories you already knew. You will find where Larry McMurtry got his inspiration for Lonesome Dove and hear from the last people for whom this era is living memory.

Some viewers express annoyance of course regarding the documentary's depth of detail regarding the fate of people who had been here prior to the arrival of Europeans. As former Texas Governor Ann Richards notes, this has been a fate shared by countless conquered people throughout human history. Given Western values the destruction of a stone age culture by a deeply acquisitive technological one would be a foregone conclusion. Certainly the tribes of the British isles in Boudicca's time ultimately fared no better under the succession of invaders beginning with the Romans. Difference is the amount of detail we have about the annihilation of North American tribes as well as information about their culture. For Americans, it is our history. We cannot and should not deny those moments when we forsook our primary ideals. And this happened many times and not just to aboriginal tribes. We would certainly be disturbed if Germans today knew nothing of Hitler.

But The West ultimately isn't about victims. It is about events and consequences in circumstances unique in human history which will likely remain unique until such time as we journey to the stars.",1321228800,12,1702,4.985915492957746

809168,5,6304209908,"Ken Burns' work is always first rate.  I own most of his work on DVD, and The West plays second fiddle to none of them.  Rather than taking the safe, politically correct road, demonizing European settlers while glorifying the Native American cultures, he paints a balanced picture.  Whites were responsible not just for atrocities, such as deliberately exposing Native American tribes to smallpox via infected blankets they sold them, but they brought some amazing good things, like railroads and telegraphs.  And the Native Americans were not all innocent children of the Earth, victimized by the incoming white settlers.  To quote one of the Native American historians from the film (who is Native American herself,) they did some ""pretty terrible things"" themselves.  There was good and there was bad, and both white and native cultures perpetrated their share of each.  Burns does a superb job of bringing this out without taking sides.

As with all his projects, productions values are off the charts.  The photography alone is deserving of awards.  The music is gorgeous, and compliments the exquisite photography.  The dialogues weave seamlessly between narration, authority guest speakers, and excerpts from journals, diaries, and other source records of the period.  When all is said and done, this may arguably become Burn's Magnum Opus.  It ought to be required viewing in public schools, and I can think of nothing on film that would be more worthwhile for a family to sit and watch together, especially if there are children.  In particular, have them pay close attention to what it means to make a gift of a horse.  There are lessons in this poignant story we can all learn from.

809172,3,6304209908,"Ken Burns Presents: THE WEST is narrated by Peter Coyote and written in part by Geoffrey C. Ward. As with other Burns documentaries it has an impressive roster of voiceover actors.

First aired on PBS in 1996, this eight-chapter overview of the area now defined as the western United States obviously attempts to readdress traditional histories by entirely omitting gunslingers and outlaws and favoring all others over WASP males. Thus, it's well-intentioned and compelling as it stands but is a flawed and incomplete work..

809289,4,6304209908,"This series on the old west is a must have for any old time wranglers out there that still are interested in, and or long for the days of cowboys, cattle drives, and beans and bacon.  Quite honestly, one does not have much of a choice these days in locating a DVD collection about the old west.  Most of what's available today pertaining to that era is based on novels, and fiction.  This very authoritative, visually exuberant series is well done, and very interesting throughout despite its very obvious slant toward making all white men the bad guys, and all Indians and other blood thirsty war parties slaughtering settlers and what not simply misunderstood and having no other choice.  Despite its very obvious bias, its still a most powerful and immensely entertaining documentary on a fascinating, but unfortunately all but forgotten time in our nations history.  One thing that should be cleared up however, is that this is NOT a documentary directed by Ken Burns like the Civil War collection that this series bears a strong resemblance too in design.  Ken Burns is merely the producer.  Adding Ken Burns' name to this production adds some  heavy authentication and quality to the production for all those that are familiar with his superb Civil War series.  Although it is in no way up to par with that collection, it is still a series well worth your time and money in these days of the vanishing prairies of yesteryear..",1248048000,9,1432,4.788617886178862
809290,2,6304209908,"Although interesting, The West did not even begin to match The Civil War by Ken Burns.  I personally thought too much time was devoted to the Noble Savages.  Much singing of the Indians was evident but absolutely nothing to explain what the singing was about.  There was no coverage about the outlaws and lawmen of the West.  I think that at least some information regarding this aspect of the West should have been included.

Overall a somewhat disappointing product.  If I had it to do again, I would not purchase The West.",1247184000,31,525,4.6521739130434785
809291,5,6304209908,"I recently purchased this DVD set/documentary from Amazon, even though I read the single negative review first.  I have learned to sense invalid positive or negative reviews, particularly when they stand out vis a vis all the other reviews, and the reviewer who criticized this documentary was simply totally in error, as to his facts and comments!

This is an absolutely beautiful documentary, and it meets all of Ken Burns' own directoral standards, and more. But of course this would have to be the case, just in terms of basic logic, since Burns put up the money for this project.

The criticism of Peter Coyote, and of those interviewed in this documentary, couldn't be more invalid.....Coyote's voice and demeanor and attitude are all perfect for this project and I cannot imagine anyone else matching the high quality of his voice-over comments.

The experts interviewed throughout this film, are the best in the world when it comes to the history of the West (including J.S. Holliday, the premier historian/writer of California gold rush history).

As for the negative reviewer's criticism of the ""panning"" of some of the photos, this panning movement is done with the same high quality that Ken Burns provided when he directed his other documentaries, and is only used in specific cases, where the photograph gained value-added by the technique.

This is such a beautiful documentary set, and is done so professionally and with such sensitivity and skill throughout, that it would be a shame if any of you who are considering purchasing ""The West"" DVD set, failed to acquire this wonderful documentary, because of a single, off-the-wall, inappropriate, and invalid review.

But then the above comments are simply my opinion, and you the reader of these reviews, will have to judge for yourself.",1242345600,101,1803,5.070945945945946

809293,2,6304209908,"I am surprised people can't get their facts straight surrounding this particular series: Ken Burns didn't write it, Ken Burns didn't direct it, it is ""Presented By"" meaning some cash was exchanged and the venerable Mr. Burns was able to tack his name onto the proceedings. This series was directed by Stephen Ives, and written by Dayton Duncan & Geoffrey C. Ward. This fact becomes eminently clear after about 30 minutes worth of footage & realizing, ""Wow, these guys really wanted to emulate the Ken Burns style and failed miserably."" The story is brutally long & brutally boring, whilst simultaneously evoking not empathy for its Native American subjects but an unfortunate casual contempt at the constant PC-run-amok tone that permeates the entire program.

The narrative is carelessly chopped up & regurgitated between heaping helpings of ""oh, don't you feel bad for the poor Native Americans"" and ""don't you see how horribly our government treated the Native Americans?"" and ""oh goodness, don't you just want to give back Oklahoma to the Native Americans?"" I find it amazingly ironic that a series meant to evoke pride along with sympathy for a people ends up alternating between brutally boring and brutally grating. Peter Coyote doesn't have the most pleasant voice for narration, so the proceedings are hobbled by that fact. And that's before you get to the ""historical experts"" and various presenters: the strangest cast of outsiders, cast-offs, and weirdos ever assembled in a historical documentary. Please don't mistake me for some sort of shallow frat-boy, but every time N. Scott Momaday appeared on screen I immediately busted out laughing at his creepy stentorian tone mixed with his used-car-salesman approach to spinning tales. Some of the other folks (Native American women in particular) were downright frightening.

It is difficult to do much more than evoke pity in a documentary this long because the consistent recourse of said tribes was to withdraw back into their ""sacred medicine"" and ""spirit journeys"" which to modern ears just sounds infantile and silly. So during passages where the authors are attempting to emphasize the difficult plight of the Indians, you're attempting to keep a straight face. Every once in a while they will drop events of actual historical significance... done poorly. It doesn't take a movie critic to immediate tell that this is NOT done by Ken Burns, it is done by people imitating Ken Burns BADLY.

And speaking of The Man himself, i l-o-v-e-d The Civil War, i l-o-v-e-d Jazz, and Ken Burns' Baseball is hands-down the finest TV series ever made about anything (as a baseball fan, i might be biased,) but The West was a series that i actually dreaded watching. I had to watch every episode to get the whole feel, but in addition to inspiring fits of laughter at inappropriate times, i fell asleep at least twice. If The Civil War, or Jazz, or Baseball is on then i am at full attention and enraptured. With The West i feel like Sally Struthers is going to bust in the room and demand i pay some Lakota woman's college tuition for the sins of my presumed forefathers. It's enough to make me wince.

I'd love to know what people think is so great about this series because I think it's unfortunate trash. Right down to the grainy new-age landscapes they use as backgrounds & the ripped-off attempt at Ken-Burns-style slow-pans across grainy photos (note to filmmakers: it helps if the photos are interesting & actually assist in telling the stories instead of just panning for panning's sake.) Westward expansion is usually underrepresented in the history books, and once in a while you will get a nugget of interesting info, but if you came here looking for history you will be sadly disappointed. BUT, if you came here for unintentionally hilarious melodrama, told by scary shut-ins and presented with pointless grainy photos & bad new-age visuals, brother you came to the right place! Personally, i will watch no more forever.",1212710400,72,3986,4.989473684210527

DVD ~ Peter Coyote
When some people use the word ""documentary"" they seem to imbue it with an expectation of total objectivity--as if one could eliminate all traces of cultural experience from one's makeup and discover a shining path of ultimate ""truth"" simply by the act of becoming a filmmaker. Nonsense. We are all a product of our times and of the culture in which we were raised and educated. Documentaries are always, always, always selective. There is no such thing as total objectivity, either in writing or in filmmaking.

That said, this is an enormously valuable effort to sift through an extraordinary cross-section of materials and condense them into 12 and 1/2 hours of very viewable, enlightening and often extremely moving stories. Yes, that's right, I said ""condense"". The documents available on the history of the West literally fill many museums, and unless you plan to spend every waking moment of your life from the time you learn to read until the day you die as a serious scholar of western lore, you will never gain a complete knowledge of the subject. This is an outstanding effort to provide a distillation of the sense and feel of the west from the earliest days of indian tribal inhabitation to the passing of the frontier. To have even attempted that feat in a 12 and 1/2 hour presentation took courage and imagination. Although I have often grumbled to myself about Ken Burn's relentless imposition of an over-stylized montage technique on the presentation of his documentaries, I have nothing but astonished admiration for his accomplishment in crafting this mini-series. Bravo.

Yes, yes, it doesn't tell the whole story of the West. Yes, it is selective. And, yes, there are other things that could have been included. C'mon guys, quit sitting back like Monday morning quarterbacks and griping about what is missing from this presentation. Think about what he WAS able to accomplish! He captured a sense of sweep, a sense of the development of the frontier, and an extraordinarily vivid impression of the cultural, religious, social, economic and racial collisions that occurred in this vast space over a period of a couple of centuries. Good grief, what do you want, blood? If he had never made another movie, this series would still have placed him in the pantheon of American documentarians. No one is claiming that this is the only document you need to expose yourself to in order to achieve perfect understanding of the history of the West. But it's certainly one absolute requirement for inclusion in any attempt to understand the subject.

For any collector of Western memorabilia and lore, for any teacher who wants to enrich a class in American studies, and for anyone at all who simply wishes to gain a sense of the West in our history, this is a must-have set of dvds to add to your collection. It should be available in every school and public library and rerun regularly on PBS. It's the best thing Burns has ever done--the Civil War series notwithstanding--and those who chirp like little toads that it should have been better are welcome to make an effort to direct and produce a version that improves on it. Don't hold your breath until that happens.

Now I'm about to suggest a bit of social heresy in this day of 30 second commercials and infinitesimal attention spans. If you really want to gain the ultimate impact, try total immersion. Choose a rainy or snowy Saturday or Sunday, lay in a goodly supply of your favorite food and drink, lock the door and turn your phone off (!), and then do a total viewing immersion. Watch the entire series from beginning to end in one marathon day. And by the way, treat yourself to some solitude. That's right, do it alone; spend one day watching this without having to pay attention to the needs or attitudes or reactions of a viewing companion. Let it surround and soak into your senses. Embrace the barrage of images and sounds. Plunge headlong into that amazing collection of stories about people and places and events. It will change you. You won't come away with total recall of details, but you will achieve a new sensory and intellectual appreciation of our history that is geometrically greater than watching it piecemeal with days or weeks intervening between the episodes. Later on, after some time has passed, you can go back and view it again in the self-contained capsules; that time through, you will absorb the detail. Go ahead, try it. Challenge your mind.

Well done, Mr. Burns! My hat is off to you. And thank you PBS for reminding us that our brains are for thinking.",1206662400,244,4586,4.807351077313054

809357,3,6304209908,"This series is very entertaining, which is certainly an achievement. However, political correctness does pervade it as previously noted. You can see this right away in the first episode. For example, it points out as false the notion that native people lived in harmony with each other before the white man's arrival, but then it fails to condemn the natives' wars with each other, or even to treat them negatively. Rather, the ""warrior traditions"" which included beheadings, mass slaughters, brutal subjugation and conquest, war for war's sake, ethnic cleansing, enslavement, and other savagery visited upon other natives, are treated as simply that, traditions somehow worthy of our respect. How about those exalted ""Dog Soldiers"", basically the natives' equivalent of the SS. Are we too politically correct to condemn immoral acts simply because they were done by people of color to each other? Are we too immature to view the natives as anything more complex than the white man's victims? Isn't it disrespectful or racist or patronizing to treat these wrongs as acceptable just because they weren't done by Europeans? Is the idea ""they were ignorant savages, they didn't know any better""? Does anyone believe that? What's the message here?

There are also some glaring inconsistencies. For example, in the first episode, we are told that the natives were not all the same: different groups had very different languages, customs, habitats, governance, religions, etc. However, we are then told throughout the series that ""the Indian"" believed this or that or did this or that. Often this is said on screen by someone who has native ancestors, as if he or she is speaking for all natives. Does this make sense?",1165190400,76,1712,5.136200716845878
809358,5,6304209908,"Ken Burns 'West' was just what I as a resident alien wanted to see , after trying to find some comprehensive history of this region. The documentary puts everything in perspective with some memorable quotes 'One man's exploration is another man's home' , 'It is North for the Mexicans, South for the British Canada, Home for the Native  people, West for the Americans'. But it is the 'West' that has attracted people from around the world. The dispossession of the Native Indians is indeed tragic. Most literature on this phase of history has been one-sided with each seeing themselves as a victim. This documentary is not judgemental, but lets us meditate over all the facts in a hope some of the wrongs won't be repeated.
People have flocked to the West via sea routes, overland routes, railroads, freeways, and air route. Having landed here via the air route, I chuckle when some American tells me that I am brave to be here on my own. The 'West' is a story of few extraordinary successes that has enticed so many people hoping to replicate that success. The letters of the unsuccessful gold rush pioneer to his wife, the struggle of the couple to make it in a ranch in the mid-west are tragi-heroic.

809364,5,6304209908,"Growing up in the Midwest, I thought ""The West"" was Hopalong Cassidy, Randolph Scott and John Wayne ~ nevertheless Westerns or B-Westerns captured my interest and I became addicted to what it was like from the very beginning of the West!  Here is a wealth of history collected within the realm of centuries, put down on paper by Geoffrey C. Ward and Dayton Duncan ~ directed by Stephen Ives and presented by Ken Burns on five discs, as we take the journey westward bringing together all races, nationalities and religions striving for a new land and freedom for all her people.
Never have I witnessed such openness in the telling of  the triumphs and tragedies of America's westward expansion ~ it took more than 75 historians on this project to make it right.  Right from the git go we have Episode One(The People/Bonus DVD Features), Episodes Two & Three (Empire Upon The Trails/The Speck of the Future), Episodes Four & Five (Fight No More Forever/The Geography of Hope) and Episodes Eight & Nine (Ghost Dance/One Sky Above Us) ~ featuring some of the most beautiful photography of our country.  The entire collection covers the period of 1800 to 1915, wonderfully narated by Peter Coyote (whose voice sounds very much like Henry Fonda).
This is one of, if not the best documentaries on ""The West"", I've ever seen.  Been collecting Time/Life leatherbound books on the subject for years ~ Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell books and paintings ~ plus bronze of ""The Mountain Man"", ""The Rattlesnake"" and ""Comin' Through the Rye"" by Frederic Remington.  Ken Burns ""The West"" on DVD is something I will cherish the rest of my life ~ will pass it on to my children and grandchildren, so they will know this is the way it was moving WEST!

Try to get interest up for remainder of DVDs, but family leaves the room when I suggest trying the next DVD in the series.

How America developed the most advanced technical, medical, industrial, and economic democratic Republic is sadly absent in this series of The West.",1512604800,,396,4.838235294117647
