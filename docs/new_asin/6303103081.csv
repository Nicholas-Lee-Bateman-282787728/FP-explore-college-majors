559770,3,6303103081,"For my money, Anthony Hopkins as Hitler beats his movie rivals into a cocked hat.  Good backup from convincing portrayals of Borman and of Goebbels, although the script does not really reflect the villainy of any  of the trio as they contemplate death a little too calmly in the Bunker.  Albert Speer gets off very lightly in this movie as the minister hero who  plans Hitler's murder and torpedoes his scorched earth policy. There are  some factual errors which are unfortunate as the movie poses as a semi  documentary.  Eva Braun's brother was almost certainly shot for treason,  not hanged, and it is untrue Hitler never left the Bunker after January  1945 - he visited the Oder front in March. The film's emphasis on  electricity and water shortages in the Bunker actually enhances the movie's  theme that Hitler's vision of empire is shattered.",934329600,6,850,4.874125874125874

559873,5,6303103081,"Anthony Hopkins was once asked how he prepared for his performance as Adolf Hitler in the Fuehrer Bunker in the final days, and he said that he based it off an extremely annoying uncle he had.

The uncle must have been a very nasty character indeed, because Hopkins doesn't impersonate Hitler...he inhabits the role, and won the Emmy Award he so richly deserved for this movie.

I'll let others argue over who is the better Hitler: Alec Guinness in ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"" or Hopkins in ""The Bunker,"" or Bruno Ganz in ""Downfall,"" but all are outstanding, handling the same subject in different ways.

This is film has a slightly different focus, looking a bit more at the various characters trapped in the Fuehrer Bunker with their deranged boss, most of whom were stuck there by duty and happenstance. For duty: the telephone operator, the maintenance man, Hitler's secretaries, cooks, and maids, the various generals and aides, who took down and passed on his increasingly insane orders. For happenstance: Hitler's fawning acolytes, like Joseph Goebbels and his whole family (who meet a ghastly fate), the crawling and creepy Martin Bormann, the slightly rational Albert Speer, and the bizarrely devoted Eva Braun.

Seeing these cutthroats and poltroons in the final hours of the Third Reich, as Hitler's demented dreams all come crashing down on their heads, makes you realize just how Nazi Germany's real evil was how it put the very worst people at the head of state: men and women without honor, without compassion, without empathy, without humanity, and let them and their bloodlust, kleptomania, paranoia, and greed loose upon the world, checked only by the massive force and determination of their enemies. Someone said that ""A Police State is one where the police are criminals,"" and Nazi Germany was surely that, and ""The Bunker"" shows how it collapsed of a combination of its own failures and its enemies.

And it reminds us of something better: Gandhi's words that ""All tyrants must fall.""",1422403200,,2006,4.994011976047904

559925,4,6303103081,"TV movies generally lack atmosphere, and this one is no different. But it is very authentic in its
depiction of the characters and events. The odd thing about it is that its principals represent a
strange gathering of movies and TV shows: Martin Bormann is the intrepid detective from The Day of the
Jackal, Goebbels is from The Boys in the Band, Albert Speer (the closest thing the show has to a
protagonist) was Jean Valjean in a TV Les Mis, Eva Braun comes from Rich Man, Poor Man, and there is
even a very young version of the future Inspector Foyle (Michael Kitchen). The main reason to watch
is Anthony Hopkins, who gives a stunning performance as Hitler, varying from awkward chumminess to
shrieking paranoia and, finally, numb acceptance of the most deserved doom in history. Viewers
who are unfamiliar with these events can add a star to my rating, for the narrative is sure and true.",1355097600,2,893,4.658227848101266
559926,5,6303103081,"I got Bunker because I wanted to see how Anthony Hopkins would handle the character of Adolf Hitler.  I really didn't expect to be so blown away by the authenticity he brought to the role.  For me, Downfall was the best version of the same movie I'd ever seen.  Sniff.

In a way, though, Downfall didn't provide the actors with enough room for interpretation.  Bunker is slower, allowing for more focus on the characters.  It's like seeing all the GOOD books you've read about Hitler, come to life.  When you read Mein Kampf, you see inside the mind of Hitler, and Hopkins transforms that book, it seems -- into the man you see onscreen.  I can't otherwise describe his portrayal.  You just have to see it.

I got the VHS tape of Bunker, not the DVD, so I don't know what else the DVD has on it, but I'm sure it's better.  The VHS played crisply on my Toshiba 19L4200U, which I also got here at Amazon.  (Man, that TV makes old VHS tapes play like DVDs.)

Really.  If you're interested in this period you MUST see the superior performances in this film.  Many well-respected Brits and American actors round out the cast, every one of them well suited, with a great script, acting and superior direction and camera work.  This is a film to watch many times over.

My only criticism is that the film is too short.  This would have been a great cast to turn the production into a longer mini-series.",1351123200,,1396,4.429133858267717
559976,1,6303103081,I like Anthony Hopkins and enjoyed him in films like The Bounty which itself was not a great film remake and in Silence of the Lambs. He seems unsuited for this film in his portrayal of Adolf Hitler. Perhaps I was somewhat disappointed in this film after watching the better portrayal of Hitler's last days in the movie Downfall. So if you enjoy movies about Hitler and Nazi Germany then I'd recommend leaving this film buried in the bunker and watch the well done Downfall.,1347926400,2,474,4.588235294117647

559979,3,6303103081,"Pluses: - I enjoyed watching Anthony Hopkins descend into ever deepening madness as Hitler. You can actually feel a little sorry for the guy when he says 'the war is lost'.
  - The film was very well researched
  - Piper Laurie does a chilling turn as Magda Goebbels insanely planning to kill her own children, all the while acting she was planning this heinous murder for the greater glory of the Reich.
  - Great supporting cast of folks wondering if they can survive, especially Von Bulow and the 'blond guy who repairs everything' and is the last to see the Goebbels children alive. (sorry blond guy, i can't remember your name or the name of the part you played!, but since nobody else has mentioned you! ...). Its kind of touching after Hitler's death when these people say goodbye to each other. You can see that they don't think much of their chances. BTW I don't care that they're British or American. They're have an ""Everyman"" quality.

Minuses  - i understand that Hollywood movies need a protagonist, and I'll leave aside the whole debate about Speer's repentance, but Richard Jordan's pontificating as Speer wears thin after awhile. Some of this material could be cut.
  - the 1980's made for TV production values , cheesy score (never heard the original), generally overblown tone.
  - Cliff Gorman is an absolute disaster as Goebbels - i don't care that he doesnt LOOK like Goebbels - but he plays the part like early Sylvestor Stallone , like a goomba. his constant leering and triumphal stares are grotesquely stupid... did Goebbels not show a SINGLE unhappy emotion during the entire last ten days?. Even if Goebbels acted like this, Gorman can't pull it off. And Goebbels/Gorman has a LOT of screen time. Negative one star, maybe two for this performance alone.",1318204800,,1781,4.784313725490196

559981,2,6303103081,"The Bunker - HBO's 1980 made for TV attempt at the telling of Adolf Hitlers last days is really only saved from receiving less stars due to one Anthony Hopkins.
Mr. Hopkins is, as always, superb and his portrayal of Hitler as a man descending into utter madness as he orders that his country be 'Scorched' and demands that his treacherous generals are sought out and strung up by the neck is nothing short of brilliant.

But... The film is, in general, somewhat of a let down. Yes, it's true that are a number of other British actors in the film some of whom have played German military officers before but at least in those movies they spoke with German accents and looked the part. The look and 'feel' of some of the characterisations here are almost farcical. Doctor Morell for instance (played by British actor John Sharp, a Yorkshireman), he looks like the Tetley Tea man from the TV adverts. Totally wrong for the part.

However, most of the major characters here are played by Americans and this is another tremendous drawback for the whole film. Germans do not speak with American (nor British) accents. Even Anthony Hopkins can speak with an accent but this was not taken advantage of. Richard Jordan plays a passing role as Albert Speer and looks somewhat the part at least but he is American. I have nothing against this but he could've been brilliant had he been coached (along with all the other actors) in using a German accent. Better yet, it would've been good to have had some real German actors in there to give a more genuine feel to the whole project. I think probably the only actor to sound even a little foreign was Michael Lonsdale. He played Martin Bormann. You can't tell me that there were zero German speaking actors living in the USA and that none were available at the time of filming. No - It's typical really of American film makers to go down this road and ruin a perfectly good story before it even gets launched. Do they think the American public cannot interpret a foreign sounding accent for themselves? That they have to use 'American' accents for everything? The actors may as well have been chewing gum to make the audience feel even more at home. -  Imagine say, Pearl Harbour being remade where all the actors spoke with, perhaps, Australian accents.... It cannot work can it?

The farce doesn't end there. Another reviewer stated that Goebbels (Cliff Gorman), 'looks and acts like someone who just wandered in off the set of 'The Godfather'' - and he's absolutely right. Put him in a slightly different coloured trench coat, pull the collar up and stick a Fedora hat on his head and he would've been just that. Incredibly, and this is totally beyond me, Piper Laurie was chosen to play Magda Goebbels. Why for heavens sake? She wanders around the set with that silly smiley face as she systematically puts her children to death. It's insane. Talking of the children... What about the scene where they are all lined up along one side of the long table in the Reich Chancellery Mess Hall? - They're like the Von Trapp kids from the 'Sound of Music', I half expected Julie Andrews to come on singing 'These are a few of my favourite Things' or something. This, I would say (IMHO) was probably the worst scene of all and should most definately have been consigned the cutting room floor. The film quality isn't that great either. TV film budget I guess.

I have not yet seen The Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich starring Bruno Ganz but from the reviews I have read and the fact that it is in German, sounds like it out performs this HBO offering by a long way - Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a look see if you at all interested in the events that took place in the final days of Adolf Hitler in his Bunker - But, it could've been so much better.",1309824000,3,3806,4.526162790697675
559982,5,6303103081,"I can understand why Sir Anthony Hopkins won an award for his portrayal of Adolf Hitler.

559983,1,6303103081,"I'll just say that Hopkins' version of Hitler is so ridiculous that no other argument is necessary to give this film one star. But I'll add a few things: the lengths at whic the film goes to pertray Speer as a 'good guy' is baffling; the character of Goebbels looks and acts like someone who wandered off the set of 'The Godfather'; Goebbels' wife goes about preparing the death of her kids with a smile on her face, as though planning a picnic; the dubbed scene where Hitlerjugend sing (open their mouths) is the most ridiculous thing ever seen in any film that aspires to portray a major historical event. And what's with the lighting? At times it seems like watching a sitcom. Ridiculous, tedious, utterly pointless.

The movie shows the personalities of the Nazi leadership and bunker staff as the end got closer and closer for the Third Reich. Delusional, hysterical and vengeful Hitler displayed signs of psychosis and medical issues due to the failed assassination attempt the previous July. His entourage displayed delusional behavior as well, some of them believing military success against the Allies was still possible (although this did not include the senior generals there) and others jockying for political power even as the area the Nazis controlled continued to shrink.

The quality of the dvd is NOT very good at all. I'd almost say it looked like a bootleg but it is an HBO Home video release. And it's not all that old really but I'm guessing HBO just didn't put very much money into the production which probably is why the visuals and audio is as bad as it is.

All in all, there's no way I'd spend more than a buck on any of these that are at my local dollar stores.  Amazon has way too high prices on most of it's media and what can be a 30 dollar item one day, can change to 5 bux the next day. Huge markup.

I put it in when I got home and I was glued until it concluded.  You know when you find a movie special when you miss something or some dialouge and you rewind it just to make sure you didn't miss something.  I am 29 years old and not a big history buff or anything, in fact I find a lot of war subjects really boring.  This movie however was way different.  First off it wasn't Guiness is was Hopkins...I probably should have read the box....whom really portrayed the character in a personable light.  I'm not saying you can sympathize with this dude but most movies and people portray him as a crazed psychopath and really Charles Manson like and thats not accurate.  The movie was a mini series that was aired back in the early 80's adn thus you have the made for tv movie feel....from the early 80's.  I think however that the way the scenes and storyline were contrived were very amazing to where the viewer will feel slightly drained afterwards like they were also on a slow decent.  The dialouge was good and someone one here complained about the soundtrack but you rarely pay attention to it, especially with Hopkins dominating screen presence.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has ever been interested in what the final days of Hitler were, its not 100% accurate but its pretty close, with Hitlers twitching and shaking more apparant until he simply doesn't care anymore in which he has a nervous breakdown.  The set is made as the actual bunker was made, yeah I wikipedia'd everything.  The best part of this movie is that like I said it gives you the feeling of the whole scenerio as if you were right in the room with good direction and good screenplay.  Only downer is some scenes you wanted to have more depth did not, such as Hitler and Brauns time together...then again I guess behind the door no one saw so they did not speculate.",1247702400,2,2037,4.4144385026737964
560048,3,6303103081,"This was a 1981 CBS mini-series produced for network TV. The production quality is fair. The interior shots of the Bunker and Deiter's office have a ""stage look"" to them. I do like the fact that it shows the ""Courtyard of Honor"" and inside the ""New Reich Chancellery."" Events are shown from different points of view and film shifts back and forth between them. The main characters ""followed around"" are Hitler, Speer,  Bormann, Eva Braun and the Goebbels family.

Sir Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hitler is good overall, showing him in different moods and settings. There still is an element of theatrics at times, through scenes of yelling and gestures and movements for dramatic effect. These dramatic elements following what is generally shown in the footage of Hitler's exaggerated speaking style, and assumed to be his same mannerism in most all circumstances.

Hitler is generally shown to be a shell of his former self. One flashback that does work is the one that goes back to a pre-war birthday party given by Hitler for Albert Speer. It shows the energetic and charismatic Hitler to contrast his portrayal at the end. I applaud the fact that this film shows Dr. Morrell and provides scenes of his treatments/injections as to Hitler, which none of the other three bunker films do. The film does a good job of showing Bormann and his influence with Hitler and power he obtained.

However, the film is too sympathetic to Albert Speer. Some of the other actors' portrayals are unconvincing, such as those of General Keitel, General Jodl, and Goebbels. Further, several of the actors have English accents. Some of the real characters are left out of the film: such as General Krebs, General Burgdolf and General Weidling. Further, the scene showing the death of SS General Fegelein is not accurate but neither was the information provided in the book, ""The Bunker.""

The film is not as graphic or as realistic as ""Downfall"", but one has to remember that this film was done for American network TV in 1981.  Of course, there are some inaccuracies and license that was taken to dramatize events and move the film along. In the end, it holds up well overall. I would rate the four bunker films:

1) Downfall
2) The Bunker
3) Hitler: The Last Ten Days
4) The Death of Adolf Hitler (the worst)",1246060800,26,2294,4.792405063291139

Even if you have seen 'downfall' this movie is well worth seeing and thinking over. Hitler was a human man driven by many factors  and he was not insane but he was merciless and evil.  He was also power mad and in this movie we see the shell of a man near the end of his life as his cruel dreams of empire are finally destroyed.  This is a great movie and is well worth owning.

Gehenna is my best guess.  Hitler, his blushing bride, and the entire Goebbels  family all stay  to perish with their demi-god  and they give their tragically trappped children cyanide, like most of the other poor souls caught in Hitler's  personal psychotic flame-out.  It's not terribly intense or rippping at all, just a whimpering end to history's most  exptreme abuse of political power, and our closest call to being ruled by the devil. Only passing references to the Holocaust.",1224201600,3,865,5.233576642335766
560101,5,6303103081,"Before Downfall, there was The Bunker.  Nearly the entire movie is watching and listening to Hitler speak about the events at the end of the war.  He goes from joy to dispair to suicide in only a few days.  It is interesting to see a historical figure in such a situation, with many of his actual words being quoted.  We know much about what Hitler did and said near the end because so many of those who were with him were extensively interviewed by Allied intelligence.  Not an action adventure, not even much of a war movie, but an excellent portrayl of the events leading up to the end of the war in Europe.",1220659200,3,610,4.315789473684211
560102,4,6303103081,"The Bunker is one of those movies it seems everyone would find fascinating.  Anthony Hopkins, as always, is excellent.  I can find nothing to criticize about the movie, because the settings and characters seem authentic, the script intelligent and realistic, the (true) story fascinating, and no noticeable flaws distracting the viewer from the plot.  I think the actress who played Eva Braun was considerably prettier than the real person, otherwise, could find nothing that did not ring true.  Watch Adolph unravel along with the 1000-year Reich.  See Speer sag as he tries to thwart Hitler's most deadly plans.  It is a great movie.",1216425600,2,635,5.116504854368932
560103,4,6303103081,"This film was powerful in depicting the final days of Hitler.  Eva Braun was not what I had an envisioned.  She was classy and appeared to love Hitler very much.  She came to the bunker for the purpose of dying with him as did the family of one of his top aides.  That was hard to watch.  As usual Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance, and appeared to have studied films of Hitler to portray his body language, etc.  At times when he was in a rage, it was hard to understand what he was saying.  The problem I had with the film was that Hitler was portrayed as a pathetic figure who had not accomplished his goal of destroying the Jews and world domination.  One finds oneself almost pitying him and forgetting the monster that he was.  The film was well worth watching, and gave some interesting insight into Hitler's last days, and the manner of his death.",1216339200,,862,4.371069182389937
560104,3,6303103081,I haven't seen the whole thing yet but what I've noticed so far is that it lacks tone and atmosphere.  I've seen more tone and atmosphere in an episode of Private Benjamin or Bosom Buddies.  Downfall is a better depiction of this subject matter.,1185753600,3,245,4.545454545454546
560105,3,6303103081,"Based on James O'Donnell's ""The Bunker"", this movie attempts to recreate the last days of Hitler. On the positive side, the sets are excellent and the movie covers most of the major events that took place, although not always in the correct order. On the negative side, Anthony Hopkins' performance is decidedly two-note: either apoplectic or catatonic. He did not accurately portray the charismatic man who was able to charm, inspire and hypnotize his followers until the very last. Hopkins either screams or stares blankly into space. Also, the movie gives us a Goebbels who sounds like he's straight off the boat from Brooklyn, a Goering who reminded me of Colonel Klink and a Col. Von Below who minces about like he just stepped out of La Cage aux Folles. Who knew that the Nazi hierarchy was so gay friendly?! Speer is over-romanticized and there are several scenes which I don't recall from history, such as Goebbels' dinner party in the Chancellery. This movie just didn't do it for me. It seemed like this movie was so intent on covering all the bases that it forgot to be dramatic. Its impression is more of a Bunker highlight film than a story employing dramatic tension and buildup to achieve climax and resolution. Still, any attempt at dramatizing the Bunker days is worth viewing.",1177718400,9,1294,4.833333333333333
560106,4,6303103081,"Anthony Hopkins is a fine actor who puts in another good performance. The movie itself is what it is a 1980's TV drama about insane people in an insane regime, who started a world war,then destroyed themselves in the end",1175040000,,220,4.525
560107,4,6303103081,"I have to give the dvd version of the Bunker only 4 stars, since someone, for some reason, has changed the movie's soundtrack from the original. To hear the original score, which adds a great deal to the overall feeling of the film, you will have to secure the vhs version.

As for who captures the ""real"" Hitler better, some like Guinness, some Hopkins, and some Bruno Ganz, who is remarkable in Downfall. I think they all manage to capture something of a person who was something of a stranger to even those closest to him.

Plus, Downfall is a German-made film, and it's interesting to see Hitler through the eyes of a subsequent generation of Germans. Compare Ganz's role in Downfall with his excellent performance in Wings of Desire. Just for fun.",1150675200,50,752,4.646616541353383
560108,4,6303103081,"This version of Hitler's last days begs comparison with the earlier production with Alec Guinness.  Hopkin's Hitler comes across as weaker, less strong, but it is a careful study nonetheless.  The production is top quality, although the supporting cast is a bit weak.  The actor who plays Goebbels over does it a bit, while Speer is given a more sympathetic portrait than he deserves.  The perspective of this movie is larger, as it covers the entire three month period of Hitler's life in the Bunker.  At times a little slow, the movie is less dramatic than its earlier counter part with Guinness, but it is a worthwhile version anyway.  Hopkin's Hilter starts to grow on you after a while, while his performance lacks the force of Guinness it is still a careful study of a dictator/madman in steady decline.  Buy both versions of Hitler with Guinness and Hopkins and you will have a fascinating study of one of the world's most infamous leaders of the 20th Century.",1058400000,8,967,4.754491017964072
560141,4,6303103081,"Anthony Hopkins is absolutely riveting as Adolf Hitler.  He captures all of Hitler's mannerisms, quirks, and facial expressions.  My only complaint is that he doesn't use a German accent.  The production is poor, and there are some flaws in the story.  For example, Albert Speer is made out to be almost a hero in the film.  It has been proven that there was actually no assassination attempt made by Speer.  The guy who plays Joseph Goebbels is horrible, one of the worst acting jobs I've seen.  But overall the acting is great, and the performance by Hopkins makes this movie worth owning.",1058313600,8,591,4.735294117647059
560142,5,6303103081,"Based on James O'Connell's best selling book, THE BUNKER is one of most accurate depictions of the last days of Adolf Hitler.  I would place it second only to the more recent DOWNFALL.  Sir Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs, Nixon, A Bridge Too Far) was awarded an Emmy for his portrayal of Hitler.  Considerable research was put into the book and that same detail transfers to the screen.  The sets of the Chancellery, Bunker emergency exit and the Bunker itself are extremly detailed and could double for historic photos of the actual sites -- albeit with the rest of Berlin's skyline missing.  The late Richard Jordan (The Secret of My Success, Gettysburg) contributes a strong performance as Hitler's Armaments Minister Albert Speer -- one of the few surviving senior vistors to the Fuehrer Bunker during the last days of Nazi Berlin.

I was surpised by the high quality of this production when I first viewed THE BUNKER on television in 1981.  In the 1990s I bought the VHS copy. By that time I was a little more critical of the film having read much more on the subject.  If this film has any heroes it is Albert Speer.  The debate about Speer's intent during those final weeks will rage forever.  Still he was one of the few senior members of the German government who survived the war to tell his version of the tale.  At the very least Speer's character interacts with most of the major characters in the film and as such serves as a sort of tour guide.

Recently I bought the DVD copy.  Great to have a more resilient copy of THE BUNKER.  My solitary two criticisms of the DVD version is first that it does not appear any attempt was made to clean up or other wise digitally enhance the quality of the image.  It is basically the VHS tape on DVD.  Second was that the original ominous synthesizer music soundtrack was removed from the DVD version.

Some have compared this film with THE LAST TEN DAYS OF HITLER.  THE LAST TEN DAYS is a good film until contrived scene between Hitler and Braun toward the end of the film.  Both are good films, but I recommend you read the original books as well.",1050192000,10,2109,4.517150395778364
560143,4,6303103081,"Despite its production and acting, I must agree with James O'Connell (who wrote the book that led to this movie) that this is the most accurate description of what happened in Hitler's bunker that anyone will know, especially since the witnesses are mostly dead.
""The Bunker"" depicts Hitler precisely as he was in his last days - a drugged, drooling hypocondriac divorced from reality and obsessed with destroying his own people. While Guiness' portrayal of Hitler in ""The Last Ten Days"" may be better acting, Hitler was really a wreck during the last days, and any neo-Nazi today would do well to watch this to discover exactly how their ""Fuehrer"" ended his days.
Of course, Albert Speer's assassination attempt has now been debunked by recently-released aerial photography of the bunker, and exactly when the ""chimney"" was constructed over the air duct goes against Speer's claims. But O'Donnell died more than a decade ago, and this movie was made in the early 1980s. Neither party could have known this when the film was made.",1044576000,5,1030,4.959537572254336

I found the movie entertaining and shocking to see a englishman play Hitler. that english accent shows through. but the worst performance was by Cliff Gorman playing Joseph Goebbels (You will see what I mean) This Tape is a must for any fan of Hopkins. But Im giving it a 3 out of 5 as there is a Better video out there called ""The Last 10 days of Hitler"" it tells the story a little better.",1036022400,,565,4.053571428571429
560145,2,6303103081,Those who have read the book will be very disappointed in this movie adaptation. The movie ends long before the book and the movie totally dismisses the infamous breakout of the bunker personnel after the Hitler/Braun/Goebbels suicides. This was the really new material that could have made this movie much better than the Alec Guiness version (Hitler: The Last Ten Days). An excellent movie could be done on the breakout and the lives of those involved immediately after the Russian pillage of the bunker.,1012780800,9,506,5.035714285714286
560146,2,6303103081,"Much of this movie focuses on the supposed, 11th-hour contriteness of ""good Nazi"" Albert Speer.  In spite of having caused the death of tens of thousands in forced labor camps as Germany's Minister for Armament and War Production, Speer escaped the hangman's noose and went on to prosper after the war thanks to his skills as a spin master.  This movie, like the book it's based on, uncritically casts Speer as the hero that he wasn't. Hitler, on the other hand, is played by Anthony Hopkins as a totally one-dimensional character.  The most enduring mystery about Hitler is why millions of people fell under his spell.  Hopkins's portrayal of the man as nothing but an overbearing, nerdish brute offers no answers.  His performance pales in comparison to that of Alec Guinness in ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days."" Mr. Guinness uncannily captures the multifaceted aspects of the dictator's personality; the ruthless villain as well as the charismatic, nurturing cult figure.  The supporting cast in Guinness's movie  (in which only passing mention is made of Albert Speer)is also far superior to that in ""The Bunker.""
Although Guinness's movie does take some historical liberties not found in ""The Bunker"" (e.g., the fictional character played by Simon Ward), for my money, ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"" is the better movie.",989020800,13,1317,5.069444444444445
560147,4,6303103081,This is one the best films that have ever been made.  Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hitler was effective and convincing.  The film had a lot of suspense and action.  It kept me entertained throughout the whole film.  It was not a weak or depressing movie at all.  I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I think that it's worth watching.,978825600,3,336,4.610169491525424
560148,4,6303103081,"Anyone who was ever curious about what the last desperate days of The Third Reich were like needs to see this film. I recently read Cornelius Ryan's book The Last Battle which is about the battle of Berlin in early  1945. The movie is so faithful to the book I would not be suprised if it  were used to produce the screen play. Mr. Hopkins as one would expect does  a masterful job of portraying the doomed dictator in his subterranean  labryinth. The supporting cast is up to the task, actors look very much  like the people they are portraying, uniforms and personalities are  correct. Where history does not provide answers this movie thankfully does  not conjecture (for example the fate of Martin Borman and the disposal of  the bodies of Hitler and his wife Eva) but follows the facts as well as can  be acertained.  Hitlers violent mood swings are documented as well as every  other story about what went on in the bunker to include; quack doctors, Eva  Braun, the Goebbels family, Guderian, the political treachery of Himmler  and Goering, astrological predictions, preparation for suicides and rape by  Russian soldiers. Scenes of outright madness such as decorating The Hitler  Youth with medals while the Russian forces are blocks away blasting ever  closer add to the feeling of lunacy. The scene where the bunker secretaries  share tea and crumpets with Der Fuhrer is memorable as is the wedding  reception scene, they make you think more of an execution rather than a  celebration. Several explosions but no real combat scenes. I would have got  this on DVD had it been available, but the VCR version is of fine quality.  This is a great movie especially if you are a WW2 or history buff.",956534400,107,1702,4.7406143344709895
560149,5,6303103081,"Back when I saw 'Nixon' I thought ""Hopkins doesn't look like him"" and that mere fact spoiled the entire movie for me. Two days ago I was watching 'The Bunker' and my initial reaction was that same one. But  as the story unfolds, Hopkins not only resembles Hitler, he becomes Hitler!  All of the dictator's mannerisms, gestures, antics and tics are  there,  carefully woven with an eye-for-detail into what may very well be Sir  Anthony's best performance to date. Every other actor doing the part just  mimics Hitler's numb stupor, sudden outbursts of rage and endlessly boring  conversation, but Hopkins' portrayal is far more sinister for he humanizes  the monster by exposing him for the miserable nerd he really was (the scene  when he clumsly dances in front of Eva Braun's camera is an acting lesson  in itself). After watching the movie, one asks how did this wreck of a man  ever came to power in a nation such as Germany? What did all those people  ever saw in him to be blindingly shepherd into national suicide?
It's  true the film has poor production values. One would hope HBO had invested  in it the same resources it did for Robert Duvall's 'Stalin'. And yes,  Richard Jordan's Speer appears far more heroic than the war criminal  deserves to be remembered (although there's no evidence to say he acted  otherwise during his stay at the bunker), and true, some minimal historical  details are overlooked. Nevertheless, if you are a WWII buff, or if you  just want to see an above-average TV movie, don't miss this one. Far  superior than Alec Guiness' failed 'Hitler: the last ten days', and more  historically accurate than Derek Jacobi's 'Inside the Third Reich'.
