The ending will knock you out.
Film years ahead of its time. If your a Twilight Zone fan,you will love this film.
They made worse B Movies than this.
Edward Norris will probably be best remembered as Mickey Rooneys gangster brother,Joe in Boys Town.",1332806400,,523,4.515789473684211
8010942,3,B0001DMXJW,"The Electric Prunes were great, weren't they? Y'know, David Axelrod produced a bunch of their stuff. None of the above have anything to do with this film, being school children at best when it was made, but the song makes for an interesting juxtiposition. Edward Norris stars as an engaged socialite who is fatally wounded in a car wreck. His family is good friends with one Doctor Clark, who specializes in returning the dead to life...in theory. Well, Doc, here's your shot, don't blow it. He doesn't, but something unusual happens as Phillip (Norris) awakens and resumes his daily affairs. Seems at the very same time he was revived, a notorious gangster named Panino is executed, and his soul winds up in Phillip's body. Phil proceeds to hook up with Panino's old flame, take over his gang, and finally gets set up by one of them after he kills his brother. The police chase him back to the family mansion for the great unmasking. But a greater unmasking awaits, a cop out ending (no pun intended) to send the crowd home happy. I kind of liked TMWTL, finale notwithstanding, and Norris plays the gangster bit well. It's nothing to break your back to see, but worth a shot if you find it in a dollar bin or on one of those classic movie channels.",1152403200,,1249,4.580357142857143
8010943,3,B0001DMXJW,"Phillip (Edward Norris) is a young, well-to-do banker's son who gets killed in an auto accident. At the exact time of his death, a nefarious killer is zapped in the electric chair. Prest-o! The two switch places, due to a transmigration of souls, and you can guess the result. Phillip becomes the leader of a notorious gang of robbers (after gunning down the old leader), and starts a crime wave of massive proportions. I loved this movie all the way to the end, when the whole thing was ruined by the ""it's all been a bad dream"" twist, which I consider to be a cheap trick on the viewer! I took away one star for this tiresome gimmick...",1152057600,3,638,4.415254237288136
