7877252,2,6304801491,I don't know who still uses VHS but that's what this guy sells.  Also its not the super bowl game - very misleading - I'll never use this guy again,1424736000,,147,3.9
7877253,2,6304801491,"After reading all the reviews and scanning all the videos, it seemed that this was a must have for any Bronco fan. Unfortunately it's  just another highlight film of the year leading to the Super Bowl win. It doesn't really do justice to their season and the video quality is poor. There's no DVD option and the tape is copywritten so you can't have anybody transferred to it DVD. Don't buy it is not worth it. shipping was slow, IMO quality is marginal at best.",1424649600,,462,4.435294117647059
7877254,5,6304801491,"Still reeling from the loss of Super Bowl 48, but this brings back WONDERFUL memories and emotions for us long-time/die hard Broncos fans.  They removed all the commercials and half time nonsense so it's only about a 45 minute tape, but I love that they concentrated on the game!",1393372800,,279,4.6938775510204085
7877255,5,6304801491,I LOVE THIS VIDEO! It's got everything from season highlights to the Super Bowl! The best part of the video is Harry Kalas! AWESOME JOB!,1382054400,,136,4.48
