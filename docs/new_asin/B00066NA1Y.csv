8039283,5,B00066NA1Y,"Here are the JKD inner-workings taught on 4 dvds.  I have studied Wing Chun, Wu Wei Gung Fu, Jun Fan & JKD from the ""names"" and in my opinion you will learn more useful information from Sifu Patrick Strong's DVD series than you will paying hundreds of $$$$ on ""concept"" training fees and association dues.

If you want your own ""JKD"" I'd suggest that you start with Sifu Strong's DVD series then find a Wing Chun Sifu and a western fencing instructor and then enroll yourself in their classes in order to fill your cup.

Matt Hatmaker's Western Boxing & Craig Gemeiner's excellent Savate & La Canne DVDs would help one fill-out one's personal ""JKD"" art...

FYI:  I originally owned Sifu Strong's instructional series on VHS but lost them to a hurricane.  I think so much of this JKD instructional series I purchased it again in DVD format.  I only wish with Sifu Strong would put out more training info on DVD...",1322265600,4,912,4.592592592592593
8039284,5,B00066NA1Y,Hardcore Bruce Lee fans will find this series extremely enlightening. Strong is a thorough teacher and at times seems faster than Lee. He has been training more years than Bruce did.,1264377600,4,182,4.903225806451613
8039285,5,B00066NA1Y,"I study JKD in Denver. This DVD set is excelent. It is deeper than just technique. It is an education in Bruce Lee's physiology for speed,power and infighting. It also has some nice ideas for training drills. Mr. Strong communicates the ideas well. I love the basic mind set on ""none-intention"" and ""my instinct is to hit him."" If you study JKD, you sould get this set. If you don't study JKD, you should get this set.

  I can't wait for more materials from Patrick Strong.",1142985600,4,474,4.488372093023256
