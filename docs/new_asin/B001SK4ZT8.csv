8339930,5,B001SK4ZT8,"Enjoyed these three 8-part series when they aired on the BBC from 2006 to 2008 and they were just as entertaining again on dvd.  These light-hearted, often humorous dramas describing the goings on in 5-star London hotel have an expertly cast staff with many guest star patrons.  There is some sex, moderate language, reference to drugs and a little violence but, overall, they're just interesting, entertaining stories.  These are PAL/region 2 format, there are subtitles and a 'play all' option.  Series 4 is also excellent.",1444176000,,525,5.141176470588236
