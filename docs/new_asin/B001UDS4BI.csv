3798117,4,B001UDS4BI,Good show and good for birthday fun for the kids.  We have watched it several times since their birthday this year,1398384000,,114,4.428571428571429
3798118,5,B001UDS4BI,We let this run on a projection screen and let it play during my daughter's Abby themed birthday party.  We also watch it before attending parties so we can remind her what the day is all about.  Great video.,1394236800,,208,4.3076923076923075
3798119,5,B001UDS4BI,"I saw this episode one day on Sprout and it had my toddler and I moving & grooving, clapping and singing.

3798120,5,B001UDS4BI,"My daughter only watches this DVD around her birthday. This year she went to open it and it was cracked in half! So, we came on Amazon, ordered her replacement, got it in two days, and she was happy as a clam. It was brand new, in perfect condition. Helped her enjoy her birthday!",1332547200,,280,4.203703703703703
3798121,4,B001UDS4BI,"The 4 star is not due to quality, but due to the fact that one mom can only watch so much Sesame Street! Cute show as always. Great learning experience",1324598400,,151,4.066666666666666
3798122,3,B001UDS4BI,"It is true that there is a lot of old material in this film.  Too much live action and my little boy really likes the parts with Elmo and Abby in it.  The birthday song was kinda fun, but we don't watch it very often anymore, so I can't remember what else I didn't like!",1260576000,2,270,3.890909090909091
3798123,2,B001UDS4BI,"My 2-year-old doesn't like the repackaged Sesame Street material that makes up so many of these Elmo videos (the exception being Elmo's World, which she loves).  So, videos with 5 or 10 minutes of new material and then lots of old Sesame Street stuff makes her more whiny than happy.  This video falls into that category.  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because she does like the Elmos World part.  Instead of this, I recommend Abby in Wonderland which is FANTASTIC.",1244851200,7,467,4.590361445783133
