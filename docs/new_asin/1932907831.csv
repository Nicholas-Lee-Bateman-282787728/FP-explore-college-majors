203163,5,1932907831,"This film is a beautiful journey into healing the physical body and enhancing the spirit in the process.  It is a visual mastery that explores one man's quest for answers that apply to all of us with regards to life and how we live.  It is also about mentally, spiritually and emotionally preparing yourself for what comes next.  It is about embracing what is and finding peace.

203172,1,1932907831,"Oh no, where do I start...? My husband and I are seasoned psychonauts though we have never tried ayahuasca. We were looking for an informational-documentary-type video that shows the history of ayahuasca. We were also interested in seeing how it's made, how it's used, the effects, etc. Sadly, this video gave us NONE of that, and I mean none. This video is poorly done with terrible sound quality with no subtitles. It basically takes you on a small tour through the region where some people are still known to make their own ayahuasca, but didn't show anyone making it, consuming it, or even explain the effects or anything. The entire video is done in Spanish (because that's where they are) but with someone constantly translating to English. They really should have had the Spanish in there with English voice overs during editing, or perhaps use subtitles, anything. But had they done that we would have only had a 15 minute movie.

On top of all the general disappointment, we hung in there, expecting to see this crew actually doing ayahuasca and document the effects and spiritual journeys. But no, none of that either. They show us the scenery as they go deeper into the jungle to find a spot to do it, but never do it on camera nor talk about it afterwards. To make matters worse, they had someone do their own little soundtrack that consisted of one very annoying (and loud) song over and over and over again. It was like fingernails on a chalk board. It was annoying. But again we endured hoping to see something interesting.

About the only interesting tidbit was seeing Pablo Amaringo's art work. And even then they teased us by saying he did some amazing piece for them, but they weren't allowed to show it on camera and they could only look at it once a year themselves. Doh! They didn't show much of his art, so if I were you, I'd Google Pablo Amaringo. You would yield better results.

It lacked everything we were interested in. It had 2 awards listed on the front and we later had a good laugh about those. They were insignificant, little known awards in some discreet location. Save yourself some time and money and just YouTube ayahuasca.",1320451200,8,2161,4.651832460732984
203173,5,1932907831,"You get a glimpse of two fascinating worlds here, the deep Peruvian jungle and the ""door of perception"" that is Ayahuasca, as well as an encounter with an even more fascinating human being in the person of filmmaker and star of this documentary, Michael Wiese.  There's no effort to doll up the reality of the experience, and so it comes through with an even more profound and lasting impression.  Anyone interested in either anthropology, the psychedelic experience or remarkable men should see this.",1319414400,2,501,5.024096385542169
203174,5,1932907831,"Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms is a beautiful and deeply moving testimony.  It raises many critical questions for humanity at this time in history.  Filmmaker Michael Wiese approaches this unutterably rich and complex realm as a visionary master offering a gorgeous tapestry on fire with luminosity and imbued with a palette of human emotions and experience that is quite dazzling.  Wiese's wisdom born of his own artistic and literary creativity, and his courageous penetration of this often terrifying realm, allows one to discover through this lens of committed integrity the true potentials of the nature of human consciousness.  This film is an unforgettable experience.",1317513600,2,690,5.481132075471698
203175,5,1932907831,"There are ""more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,"" Hamlet says to his college friend. Did the tormented prince mean Horatio needs to get out more, stretch his realm of possibility; believe the unbelievable; test the plausibility of what he wants to tell him?  What Michael Wiese wants to tell us about is an ancient ritual that has become the latest drug fad.  Friends of mine traveled to Florida for the weekend special, but it's best to go to the source.  So many charlatan Shamans out there, you know.

It's called Ayahuasca. It's an ancient ritual for divination and healing.  The ritual produces hallucinations and a direct connection to the heart, soul and consciousness of Planet Earth, Gaia herself. Seriously. Plants talk to the seeker and after you puke a bit more, the planet herself talks directly to the seeker.  She has a special message for each of us.

Michael Wiese shares his personal journey into the jungle to experience first hand what this is all about.  A Shaman, an ancient ritual and this psychedelic concoction (recipe of two plants harvested fresh and cooked up) release demons, offer visions and a one on one session with the consciousness of Planet Earth.

The fact that he got his equipment - and footage - in and out of a dripping rain forest is a feat in an of itself. The film certainly took me somewhere I'd never been before, and if it's all true then everyone in Washington needs to do this ritual so they'd can stop arguing about whether Global Warming is happening or not, and quadruple auto minimum mileage standards. Gaia - the primordial mother of all -  is screaming at us and so far not enough of us are listening.

Thank you, Michael, for making this movie. Safe journey everyone.  Indeed.  What has my philosophy dreamt of lately?  How about yours?",1317081600,2,1835,4.7115987460815045

203177,5,1932907831,"This movie treats the gradual immersion of a western filmmaker into the spirit world.

Filmmaker Michael Wiese sets out on a quest. With a companion, he enters the Amazonian basin carrying with him the names of shamans and artists, all strangers to him. He seeks them out, and they minister to him by treating him with ayahuasca, a pharmacological psychotrope blending the barks, seeds, and leaves used to purge and heal bodies and invoke spirits. By itself, no element of ayahuasca cures bodies or spirits or induces visions. The potion works by activating what is dormant and potential within all its ingredients.

To awaken what is dormant and potential within is, in fact, Wiese's goal for this movie. The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms documents Wiese's search for health, meaning, and wholeness. It constitutes a chapter of his archetypal story.  Stories that people pass from one another tend to retell different stages of a single story. Someone sets out on a journey. A stranger arrives somewhere and transforms himself while he transforms the place of his arrival. In this movie, Wiese both sets out and arrives.

Wiese tells the story of his journey to the sacred in shots that convey, immediately, the faces, the artworks, and forests and villages around him. He tells his story, too, in the explanations passing from shaman to viewer through the voice of his companion. Translating the words of shamans, the companion seems to confer those words as blessings onto viewers of the movie. So the utilitarian need to translate from Spanish or Quechua into English helps achieve the deepest goal of this movie, which is to express the joy of the inexpressible.",1316822400,6,1683,5.0
203178,5,1932907831,"A film of power, poetry and beauty.  It makes the Ayahuasca ceremony accessible and explains its importance.

The film includes interviews with a shaman and rare shots of an actual ceremony in the Amazon jungle. It also includes scenes from before and after the ceremony, which I especially enjoyed.

Before the ceremony Wiese filmed his fellow travelers as they journeyed by dugout down the Amazon river.

After the ceremony, Wiese visited a local open-air market where commercialized Ayahuasca ""blends"" are hawked to tourists and locals alike. The harsh contrast between the serious Ayahuasca ceremony, and the dusty marketplace with bags of ayahuasca stacked high is shocking.",1316736000,2,679,5.377358490566038

It's a journey of spirituality that allows us each to get a glimpse of what 'reality' truly is. I found it stirring and profound. Michael's experience of consciousness is amazing. For me, I found that Mother Earth, has given him her heart so he may heal and that is the most wonderful gift of love that anyone can receive. It invites you to want to learn more and to truly be aware of your surroundings, live in gratitude and offer only love to EVERYTHING. We truly are all connected and this film shows us exactly how. It is very moving. A must see for those who are on their own spiritual journey - watching this film will instantly bring your awareness to a much higher level. Thank you, Michael.

Through Michael Wiese's personal exploration, we are transported into a world where the mystical and the day-to-day merge and miracles are commonplace. If only for the educational and entertainment value as travelogue this film would be worth seeing but this film is so much more as it explores the physical, psychological and spiritual healing properties of ayahuasca.

7801606,2,1932907831,"As I will be traveling to Peru later this year, I was looking for travelogues and I saw that this one had five stars and was only a little over an hour long. I was trying to convince a friend to watch it with me so the short length was a bonus.  The fact that it was about shamanism and alternative cultures also fit the bill, as it was close to Halloween and I thought it might be kind of a spooky tale about witch doctors in the Amazon. It was not to be!

This documentary begins with an American couple who go to the Amazon area of Peru in order to take a special psychedelic concoction only available from certain men who call themselves Shamans. (The Americans are on some sort of spiritual quest that is never quite explained.) It appears that the movie is filmed on an inexpensive handheld camcorder. That would certainly be excusable if the content of the movie was in anyway interesting, but unfortunately the story and editing is as amateurish as the videography.

The movie has four main characters. The American couple, the Shaman, and their translator.  The translation is one of the first problems.  Although I don't speak any more Spanish than I learned years ago in high school, I was able to understand the Spanish speaking Shaman better than the English speaking translator who most of the time just mumbled over the Shaman, making it impossible to understand what either was saying.  Occasionally, the movie would throw in a subtitle, and I wished that they had used subtitles throughout rather than the translator.

But, that turned out not to matter much, as the dialogue was boring and repetitive. Way too much of the movie was spent listening to  the Shaman talking (not showing!) about how he would make the concoction they would eventually imbibe (although, that is also never shown.). Almost all of the rest of the movie finds him singing. His songs are not pleasant and it  sounds like he is influenced by a lot of bad pop radio.  Eventually they leave the city and take a trip down a sadly deforested and rather ugly stretch of the Amazon, with Don Shaman singing his psuedo-pop song for a good twenty minutes of the movie, or more!  My friend and I finally muted the sound on my television.

By the end of the movie, nothing has really happened, and if you are looking for a movie about alternative realities or a nice travelogue of Peru, I would skip it.  There is one scene where they go visit an artist who has indulged in this psychedelic potion many times, and his art and the explanation of what he has painted is rather interesting.  Because of this, and also because this was a good background movie to have on while my friend and I chatted and played with our iPads, I give it two stars.",1382659200,,2725,4.5234215885947044

7801610,5,1932907831,"It all starts with a simple discussion. The next thing you know, you're off to the Amazon rainforest in South America, drinking a tea made from a psychoactive plant and taking part in an ancient ceremony intended to heal and open the realms of consciousness. That's what happened to filmmaker Michael Wiese as he was searching for a cure after being confronted with a serious disease. Michael knew the universe was co-conspiring to aid in his mission and he, his translator and wife were off, embarking on a mysterious and deeply personal adventure.

The Shaman and Ayahuasca on GaiamTV.com follows these three on a thought-provoking journey, providing unique personal perspectives, majestic and stunning visuals of Peruvian surroundings, and wisdom from a famed shaman. It also piques the viewer's curiosity: What does this psychoactive elixir taste like? How does it feel to be whisked away to other realms and connected to the cosmos? How does it feel to return to reality? Here are a few of the most shining moments from this fascinating documentary:

The Shaman knows
Don Jose Campos, the internationally-known Shaman, graciously and sincerely walks Michael and company through his homeland, and shows just what goes into having a proper ceremony, including the blessing of the tea. Viewers can sense his passion and commitment to this sacred, ancient ritual. It's also important to note that ayahuasca should never be casually ingested and should only be taken under the care, guidance and supervision of a skilled Shaman who concocts, blesses and administers it; the brew is extremely powerful and mind-altering.

Ayahuasca in art
Speaking of mind-altering, legendary painter Pablo Amaringo is also featured. It's worth watching this documentary if only to catch a glimpse of this man's awe-inspiring works that express on canvas some of the many visions and worlds he entered while drinking ayahuasca everyday for 10 years.

Courage and confidence
Shaman Don shared the most important lesson that his teacher, Don Solon, passed on to him - the true definition of confidence: ""A deep sense of trust in oneself, faith in the process of being present and being courageous and optimistic."" Not only is it a lovely definition of the word, but it's the overall message of the documentary; confidence is applied and interwoven so deeply and on so many levels. One needs confidence to be open to learning about this spiritual sojourn. One needs confidence to go through with the experience. One needs confidence to expect the unexpected during this highly unpredictable journey.

Wanderlust starring Jennifer Aniston and her ayahuasca trip it is not, The Shaman and Ayahuasca offers viewers intense magical clarity into every component of this unique ritual. Delve into a world of deep spiritual development with The Shaman and Ayahuasca on GaiamTV.com.

7801611,5,1932907831,"The Shaman And Ayahuasca by Don Jose Campos is a beautiful book and DVD filled with so many insights from this enlightened Soul from the Amazon. This book and the DVD is so special it is really difficult to express in words. Don Jose Campos clearly states ""that books are ok but the understanding of Ayahuasca will not be in words...the spirit of Ayahuasca will come to you through my intention. My energy for this is what a Shaman does. He transmits energy and healing through his songs, through his presence and with the help of Spirit called Icaros."" We learn about the healing power of the Ayahuasca, how it has been used by Shamans from the Amazon for many years, and we learn about our connection to all life. This book and the DVD will take you on a wonderful journey. The book reads like a poem and it feels like a song.  The DVD adds a beautiful dimension to the book. It has such a calming healing feeling about it. It is a book that you can read again and again and each time you will learn something new. I read the book first and then I watched the DVD and they both are truly amazing.  This is such a wonderful project produced by Michael Wiese from Divine Arts Media.

The interviews show the dedication to healing and respect for the plants that is at the heart of authentic ayahuasca medicina.  It was a pleasure to hear Don Jose singing some of his icaros, talking about the plants, and giving his views on the commercialization of ayahuasca.  The interview & artwork of Pablo Amaringo was a pleasant bonus.

Authentic ayahuasca ceremonies such as those conducted by Don Jose are serious journeys into healing and are not intended for psychedelic pleasure trips.  There is little to observe outwardly, much to see inwardly.  I'm glad director Michael Weise chose not to sensationalize this plant medicine & Don Jose's work with staged ceremonies and trippy hallucinatory graphics, but instead just stayed with the basics and, especially, the deep humanism of Don Jose.",1324166400,4,861,5.294117647058823
