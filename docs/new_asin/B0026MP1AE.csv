3854458,4,B0026MP1AE,"Frank Krueger, Sarah Thompson and Chad Everett star in this 2009 stylistic black drama about a hit man, Frank, who is contracted to carry out an unusual job. When 'The Man', the city's crime boss discovers he is terminally ill, he enlists Frank to carry out his own assassination. But 'The Man' is selfish and jealous and does not want his love interest to live if he is to die. But that means that Frank is to kill his lover .. and so he must alter the job. Action-packed, different and filled with dark humor. I liked it.",1351468800,,523,4.346938775510204
3854459,1,B0026MP1AE,Barely watchable.  Don't be deceived by the fake rave reviews.  Obviously written in an effort to attract the unsuspecting.,1296864000,,123,5.421052631578948
3854460,5,B0026MP1AE,I loved this film. Its a different take on the an indie action film. It feels very noir. I loved all the cameos from peple like Michael Madsen and this is sadly the last film David Carradine did- but he is great in it. Fun action scenes and a great new indie stars are in this film,1279756800,,281,3.9473684210526314
3854461,2,B0026MP1AE,"its is only when you stop in the supermarket to have a sneaky look in the 'bargain bin' that you discover gems like this.  the director must have a few favours he can call upon as the cast, at first glance, is top quality, espcially for independant movie.

this film is so bad its hard to watch, but you just cant drag yourself away from the screen.  the script is straight out of tarrantios trash can.  the characters are from his recycling bin.

this is like an airplane stle pisstake of pulp fiction or kill bill but i don't think they were joking.  previous reviews referred to david carradine nailing his scene - the tiger stripe silk gown is cetainly a classic - and we are left wondering what happened to previous guy who, in order to claim a favour, had to screw his pet dwarf, roland.

watch if only to see how bad it can get.",1258588800,3,835,4.280254777070064
3854462,5,B0026MP1AE,"Break is a film noire that you don't see much any more.  I IMMEDIATELY have to point out the genius of casting Chad Everett in the mob role.  Wow --- ah, we were left wanting a LOT more.  Frank Kruger -- pure star quality and nails all aspects of his role.  He truly grabs the screen.  I am STILL trying to figure out the David Carradine scene -- but Carradine amazingly works complete credence into a bizarre charachter -- he nails his last role and then some.  Bottom line, a great flick that frankly works a retro (almost sadly forgotten) way of telling a story, which was and is a total delight to see come together on film.  Director Clebenoff seems to continue breaking through where others dredge up the same ol same ol.  Totally entertaining movie.  BIG thumbs up.  Director Clebenoff is building an exciting path and vision --- this guy is the real deal. I/we wanna see more.",1254528000,,884,4.46875
3854463,5,B0026MP1AE,"BREAK is more than an action film - the characters are all great with Michael Madsen having a fetish for fat women, Chad Everett as the twisted crime boss, a bodyguard who only speaks in haikus and David Carradine having a little person as a pet on a leash. This movie is a lot of fun!",1247443200,4,285,4.107142857142857
3854464,5,B0026MP1AE,"This stylish flim has a great cast of crazy charaters played by Michael
Madsen, Charles Durning and the late great David Carridine.  Check it out!",1247443200,3,146,4.84
8353162,3,B0026MP1AE,"Great weird soundtrack, bad acting and unrealistic fighting.  Very little of David Carradine, but what you get is strange and marvelous.  One odd, but watchable flick!",1527724800,,167,5.384615384615385
8353163,5,B0026MP1AE,"I originally saw Break in Seattle at a festival in 2008 and I must say I'm glad I did. It was one of the only films at the festival with some good names and I was particularly interested in seeing it because I've been a Madsen fan for a long time, although I typically don't expect much from his lower budget projects. I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot more out of this film than the usual Madsen action movie. Madsen actually plays a supporting role (and gives a great performance) alongside some other really great actors like David Carradine, Charles Durning and the girl from Angel. The movie is a bit misleading at first, starting as more of a crime drama/love story, then halfway through morphs into a killer action flick with the introduction of Xin. The fight scenes are some of the most creative I've seen in an indie. There's so much going on in this movie in terms of characters (there's a lot) and side stories (there's several) and genres (crime/drama/action/dark comedy - and those are just the ones I picked up on) yet it all just works. I'm glad to see this movie finally being released and I would definitely recommend watching it if you're up for something original and fun.",1523923200,,1198,4.550925925925926
8353164,5,B0026MP1AE,Kept my interest. No multitasking.,1481241600,,34,6.0
8353165,2,B0026MP1AE,"""Noir-crime-drama,"" yes; ""comic book come-to-life,"" is an overblown description, like saying nobody in it did cocaine! These actors, save for one or few, are so overrated, it's a sin. When a hitman gets glorified, for the ten-millionth time, you have to have caught on, to not expect any more than a two-star experience from this movie.",1474761600,,336,5.017857142857143

8353167,3,B0026MP1AE,"Let me start by saying that I normally do not care for B-movies or self consciously stylistic films.  In fact, I seldom ever watch one straight through, sometimes quickly going catatonic or usually, hitting the jettison button and looking for another.
The acting, fight scenes, script and camera work were all solid B-movie quality but the plot had some promise with twists and turns I did not expect.  AND, I might come back and watch it again in the future to refresh the image of the over the top creepy degenerate that Carradine plays.  I know he was a somewhat more than passable actor but even he delivered his lines in a halting, unreal manner which leads me to believe it was a device of the director to develop... ?...  atmosphere?  Whatever, I can not define it.
I gave this movie 3 stars based on it holding my interest enough to watch it all and the inexplicable way it held my attention-- some of those involved with this film were doing something right.  Maybe the video comic book works better for me than I thought but it is not Sin City!  Try it out, it is worth your while if you do not terminate it quickly.",1467676800,,1126,4.436893203883495
8353168,3,B0026MP1AE,I almost gave it a 4. It had a good ending and left me wondering if she had poisoned him as the movie faded away. What killed it at the beginning was one of the big stars being poisoned and then David Carradine kissing the anti-hero.,1467244800,,233,4.086956521739131
