2701775,4,B000LC3IDS,"I thought this would be a fluff movie for a weekend.  But when I rented it on Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised at how a realistic a look it gives to Hollywood and the agent most particularly.  Not in a demeaning way, but rather in a very practical way.  I did not know much about an agent, and learned much about the industry and those that run it.",1376956800,,350,4.117647058823529
2701776,5,B000LC3IDS,"great underrated movie, insightful and funny. Plus its old, so its cheap ;) we should all keep diaries and keep track of what goes on in our lives",1371859200,,146,4.25
2701777,1,B000LC3IDS,"The running joke on the 'Mallrats' DVD commentary was that not even another Ben Affleck flop like 'Phantoms' would dare list 'Mallrats' on the back of its case for fear of being associated with the Kevin Smith film. 'Man About Town' can safely take the distinction of being the worst Ben Affleck movie that nobody should ever want to be associated with. This film is so bad it makes other Affleck flops like 'Paycheck' and 'Gigli' look like 'Good Will Hunting' by comparison. Among this film's numerous crimes is the utter wasting of a talented cast that includes Rebecca Romijn, John Cleese, Jerry O' Connell, Gina Gershon, Bai Ling and Kal Penn. Writer/director Mike Binder, who appears as Affleck's friend in the film, is a much better actor than director. He gives himelf the only real laugh in the movie after he grabs a fire extinguisher and goes after an actor who has stormed into his office to complain about some insignificant detail.

Jack (Affleck), a once successful agent, is devastated to learn that one of his only clients, a T.V writer (Adam Goldberg), is sleeping with his wife (Romijn). His other client, a self centered actor (O'Connell) is ready to fire him and seek new representation. Jack's partners (Gershon, Penn and Binder) want him to put aside his personal feelings and keep the writer as a client since their business is going under. To help sort out his feelings, Jack takes a journal writing class presided over by a snooty professor (Cleese). At first Jack isn't sure what he's trying to write about and it takes him the whole movie to realize he's trying to figure out what went wrong with his marriage. He wants to find out who he really is and how his childhood with an abusive dad, who he's now caring for, affected him growing up. Enlightened Jack comes to the life changing revelation that he's imperfect. But before Jack can sort all this out his journal is stolen by a fellow student (Ling). She plans on releasing all of Jack's true feelings about his rich clients to the media unless he pays up. Her motive has as much to do with money as pride - Jack refused 12 of her screenplays over the years.

The most painful moment in this film involves Affleck, after getting his two front teeth knocked out, wearing blindingly white buck teeth and doing his best Tom Cruise impression. There's also a charmingly racist scene later in the film that finds Jack and his office mates, who all take kung fu classes together, squaring off in an alley against Ling and her family (who not surprisingly run a Chinese restaurant). This film is shockingly bad. The only thing not shocking is that it was dumped on DVD. This is Affleck at his absolute worst. You actually feel embarrassed for him as you watch him ham it up in painfully unfunny scene after scene. The DVD extras are for masochists only. There's 11 more excruciating minutes of Deleted Scenes, 3 featurettes and a humorless gag reel. Surprisingly the featurettes don't include appearances from Affleck or director Mike Binder. At least they had the good sense to sit those out.",1208217600,3,3068,4.711359404096834
2701778,1,B000LC3IDS,This is a confused and rather dreadful movie. The only person who emerges with any credit is Rebecca Romijn - who could have a real future if she is given the right roles.,1206144000,2,171,4.212121212121212
2701779,5,B000LC3IDS,"This is truly a thought provoking movie that you need to PAY ATTENTION TO....think about it...he goes to a class to learn how to write his ""Journal"" and he really dos not know WHO he really is...just WHAT he is..his job, his possessions,etc...he starts thinking about his life, and he realizes that all the people surrounding him..at work,etc...are the same way..no ethics,no morality,no compassion,just concerned about making the big bucks regardless of having to lie,cheat,etc to get that...Going to the class makes Ben start thinking about what IS really important in life. WATCH IT . GREAT MOVIE !!",1203984000,12,602,5.153061224489796
2701780,2,B000LC3IDS,"This movie was very weird and I really didn't know if it was a drama or a comedy. The acting and story are OK. I guess it shows, I wasn't really impressed by this movie,but it was an OK watch. If your bored and want to see it, rent it.",1188000000,5,235,3.72
2701781,3,B000LC3IDS,"Affleck seems to be in just about every film under the sun nowadays.  I felt like this show was somewhat similar to the film ""Bounce"" that he co-starred in with Gwyneth Paltrow.  This film tries showing a go getter in a corporate environment whose life is falling apart around him.  Rebecca Romjin co-stars as his wife Nina, and her character adds a lot to the drama, which also includes a journal belonging to Jack (Affleck) being stolen and used against him.  Many great actors and this story was somewhat interesting, but in the end it is just one of those campy films you could enjoy on a Sunday afternoon.",1173744000,12,610,4.568807339449541
2701782,1,B000LC3IDS,Is a meaningful movie possible that tries to be both at the same time? After watching this you will only feel what a stupid movie because it self destroys any seriousness.,1172793600,2,171,4.548387096774194
2701786,4,B000LC3IDS,"A little quirky but wonderful too.  It kept me interested and watching.  Not the usual movie about Hollywood.  Good story, good acting, especially Gina Gershon and Ben Affleck, although Rebecca Romain can really act too!  I loved the storyline with John Cleese and his method of teaching.  Very cute.  It's entertaining.",1507420800,,320,5.176470588235294
2701787,2,B000LC3IDS,Yuk!!!,1505952000,,6,6.0
2701788,5,B000LC3IDS,Really funny! The perfect guy gets the perfect girl and has the perfect job. Things go wrong and the perfect girl cheats gets dumped and the perfect job goes wrong because the girl cheated with someone hooked to the perfect job. Sounds confusing but it really isn't. It's all part of what makes the movie hilarious! Who knew Affleck had these comedy chops?,1486166400,,356,4.666666666666667
2701789,3,B000LC3IDS,"The movie is actually fairly entertaining, even if silly at times. The ending however is really, really farfetched. Then again, this is supposed to be a romantic fairytale, so a perfect husband can probably forgive his cheating wife ... in a fairyland.",1466899200,,252,5.023809523809524
2701790,1,B000LC3IDS,"I couldn't get through more than about 30 minutes. Such irritatingly uninteresting people. Oh yeah, and the movie crawls at a painfully slow pace.",1458345600,,146,5.125

8160802,3,B000LC3IDS,"It's ok if you're in the right mood. I actually enjoyed the slower parts that were introspective. The scenes that involved action were not very well done.
It has some good ideas, but lots of first grade self awareness.
I did get through it.",1511395200,,240,4.4772727272727275
8160803,1,B000LC3IDS,Just terrible.,1510876800,,14,6.5
8160804,2,B000LC3IDS,"One of the most rambling movies I've seen. Whoever lied and said it was a comedy is odd so maybe my review should be railing against whoever labels movie genres moreso. This was farfetched and depressing. The main character wasn't all good but definitely didn't deserve the string of crap that happened to him either. I didn't care enough about any of the characters for anything that happened to matter really because they were all jacked up. I guess the point was to make them complex or something, but their motives were so shallow. And anyone who's taken care of a relative with alzheimers knows that rheir confusion isn't that funny really. A couple of good points were when he talked about visualizing success and manifesting that reality. And the ending pulled the whole mess together at least. But not in a romantic comedy happy ending way, moreso in a Gone Girl type way where you're just like yeah I guess they may as well. Maybe the slow pace and sappy soundtrack made it feel really heavy as well. The actors individually are cool though so I'm glad they all have a large other body of work.",1510531200,,1103,4.604060913705584
8160805,3,B000LC3IDS,"interesting exploration of the conflicts of ""work"" vs ""home"" only vaguely related to the purported wholly Weird situs.",1510531200,,118,5.611111111111111
8160806,3,B000LC3IDS,I think they were going for quirky and they accomplished that.  There's a quirky story behind every patient in the insane asylum.,1510272000,,129,4.863636363636363
8160807,1,B000LC3IDS,"Terrible movie!  Bad plot, way too long.  Yuck!!!  I would give it zero stars if possible.",1508630400,,90,4.5
