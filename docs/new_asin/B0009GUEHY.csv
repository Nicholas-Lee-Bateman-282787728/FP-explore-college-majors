8060326,5,B0009GUEHY,"To appreciate the film one has to know many details of history. Gance presents a compressed lesson telling an immense story with an economy of means. A number of incidents are not shown directly but are related through Napoleon's reactions to them; they show Napoleon's personality but one has to know the historical background. Gance's direction brings out the best out of many actors. The realistic depiction of a myriad of characters is extremely compelling and convincing: Koutouzov, Alexandre I of Russia, Pauline Bonaparte (who says petulantly to Josephine: ""You deliberately wanted to seat me in a chair which would clash with my gown!""), Josephine, Talleyrand, Joseph (and the rest, of whom Napoleon says ""what a family and that's not even all of them!), William Pitt, Robert Fulton, General Weyrother (very well played by a bony Jack Palance) and above all, Napoleon.
Mondy's portrayal, with its many details, is magisterial and gives us a full and believable picture of the person. Napoleon commands by his intelligence, and his force of will, his instanteous clarity of vision, translated into immediate action, (which must be an extremely rare combination) with a lot of temperament, but also humor. Mondy is the most realistic and believable portrayal of Napoleon by any actor because you see Napoleon thinking and cutting through psychological illusions to arrive at the most effective military decisions. Mondy also resembles closely Appiani's portrait and a string of others of the period 1805.
Gance himself speaks through through the Grognard played by Michel Simon who tells Napoleon ""I have been observing you for a long time, since the bridge of Arcole, to see where your crack pot ideas would lead."" The premature attack, against orders alluded to in the picture, may be a reference to Gance's black and white film. If it had been delayed a few years and appeared in color with sound it may have been a greater success. The Grognard's other comment about whether the dead soldiers in Hell will be crying ""Vivre l'Empereur"" is a skillful touch. As is that of Koutouzov, in a kind of waking dream sequence, making a sign for Napoleon surveying the scene after the battle ""I leave these unfortunates [the dead and dying] to your mercy and compassion."" Napoleon takes off his hat as a presentiment of respect for the most competent adversary at this battle and in the future.
The arrival of Weyrother at Austerlitz presenting the plan of battle seems to be based on the description in Tolstoi's War and Peace. The use of foreign languages, Italian (""scuzzate, padre"" to the Pope), The Pope calls him ""commediante"" which means actor on a stage. ""Commediante Io? Napoleon yells. Russian, English, and German in some of the scenes adds to the feeling of authenticity which appears throughout the film. The scene where an Austrian says to Weyrother ""I don't understand Russian"" and then a Russian says ""I don't speak German"" and everyone is happy and relieved when Weyrother says ""I am sure no one will object if we speak speak French"" is precious, but cut from the English shortened version. William Pitt going along with the secret plan (""I did not hear that"") to use the Duc d'Enghien in a plot to overthrow Napoleon and his subsequent disavowal when it fails is a commentary on Machiavellian politics.
The strategic considerations of the battle itself, where everyone around Napoleon fails to understand the reasons for his actions (and Napoleon's comment: ""one bad [enemy general] is worth two good ones"", and the misguided comment, which could have wounded Napoleon and shows the pressure under which his genius found itself ""I have never seen such an indifference to a loss of soldiers"" is very poignant. There is such a wealth of information in the film, along with the artistry of presentation, a feast for the historian and informed consumer, that it has to be one of the greatest films of all time, which unfortunately, is way above the heads of the mass public. The English language version cuts a number of scenes from the French version; the most important cut is when De Segur describes the coronation of Napoleon in words to the assembled palace staff of cooks and servants. He is in front of a large size rehearsal mock up of coronation proceedings with statuettes. Few people could have seen the actual coronation; that is why Napoleon commissioned the largest painting ever to be made by J-L David. But this is the way the common people, who were illiterate and would not see the paintings either, knew the coronation, from oral accounts. Gance plays one of the rapt servants listening to De Segur's description. There are also many other cuts, small and large, and the French version is doubtless itself considerably cut down from what what was filmed. The missing portions would have made the version that we have easier to understand. Of course, what is cruelly missing is an original language French version with good English subtitles, and a commentary explaining the background.",1494115200,,5017,4.980929678188319
8060327,4,B0009GUEHY,"This is a decent transfer of the Abel Gance film, entirely watchable, dubbed. Yet, like most transfers I've seen, it is heavily cut (40 minutes cut, only slightly over two hours remain). The  story line, of course, is heavily Francophile and favorable to Napoleon. Jack Palance is miscast as the Austrian commander, but the battle scenes are handled well enough. Still, it's something of a classic...and worth a look.",1481241600,,417,5.043478260869565
8060328,2,B0009GUEHY,The quality of the image is terrible!! The flyer of the case and the image on the DVD disc are very suspicious to be a mediocre copy from a basement manufacture. Not recommend to purchase.,1456099200,3,188,4.4
8060329,5,B0009GUEHY,"The Battle of Austerlitz DVD is a very copy of the original film.  The picture quality is good considering it a transfer of a 1960's era film.
The movie is dubbed and there is no option for the original French or even a subtitled version.  But for the price it is a fine DVD.",1452556800,,275,4.074074074074074
8060330,2,B0009GUEHY,"The quality of the scenario and the environments depicted are not of the quality realized by the producer of the film Waterloo.
Rod Steiger  (NB) and Christopher Plumer (W) make amazing impersonation of those two huge characters,  a greater effort to the reality of the scenes in Waterloo, I find that the film of Austerlitz a disappointment and should be re done by a producer that will consecrate a closer exactitude of all the movements of the campaign that culminate with  a grandiose final battle. Emphasizing on the tactical movements orchestrated by this military genius: Bonaparte!
By the way i have both films at home.",1434499200,,627,4.9523809523809526
8060331,4,B0009GUEHY,Good condition movie and packaging. I was looking everywhere for a copy and they supplied it without a problem. Thank-you.,1271030400,,122,5.15
8060332,5,B0009GUEHY,"This film was made by the French director Abel Ganze in the late-1950s. All subtitled in english, but it is interesting to note that the Russian commanders speak in their native tounge. Orson Welles has a very small part as Robert Fulton, the American inventor, who tells an incredulous Napoleon of his idea for steam-powered ships. Also a wonderful cameo performance by Jack Palance as General Buxhowden.

 The film covers the period from Napoleon's coronation as Emperor on December 2, 1804 up to the end of the day of December 2, 1805. It is truly remarkable how closely each of the actors resemble the people they portray. The films' attention to historical detail is equally remarkable. The battle scenes are very well done, and one has a sense of actually being present at the Battle of Austerlitz.

For the average viewer, this film may seem to drag in places (it runs about 3-hours), but for the serious Napoleonic history buff, I cannot recommend this film too highly.",1123459200,13,977,4.838323353293413
