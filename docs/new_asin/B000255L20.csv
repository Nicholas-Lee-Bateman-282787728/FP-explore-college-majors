8022357,2,B000255L20,I love movies LIKE this and I love the restaurant in LA but this movie was LAME.  The story was hard to follow. They kept adding characters that were insignificant and just stupid. The acting was bad and amateur. The scenes were off balance and I was not laughing 20 minutes into the film although it's supposed to be a comedy so I took the DVD out. Wasted my money on this one but did not want to waste any more time watching.,1399248000,,427,4.144578313253012
8022358,1,B000255L20,"The film starts in 1978, In NYC the numbers racket is going out of business because the state is starting a lottery. Down on his luck, numbers runner Clyde Coltrane (Glenn Plummer) gets a call from LA. His friend Roscoe (Anthony Johnson) is in trouble. Clyde joins Roscoe who owns a restaurant and the mafia some money. Clyde plans to make the restaurant profitable and bail out Roscoe, however the only thing they have is chicken and flour.

The humor is worse than juvenile. For instance a blind black man is given the name ""Eyeballs"" (Kristian Bernard). He believes he is an Italian. Another barrel of laughs is a customer in the restaurant who stutters. The hired help talk about women as if they are Cheech Marin.  I didn't laugh while this comedy was playing. The jokes didn't work. Not even a good spoof of African-American film.

As I was watching this fiasco & travesty I was already thinking how I didn't want to have to take out my time to log on to do a review because I find it tedious & time-consuming, but I was so disappointed, disgusted & appalled I just had to do the review & warn others of this foolishness. I read some of the other reviews to see if someone out there was empty-headed enough to like this crap & I see others are just as disgusted as I am and no one gave it a good review & believe me no one should.  This movie was all over the place with pointless & senseless commentary & scenes that were not relevant to anything whatsoever, nothing in this movie added up. It's as if they sat down & thought of every stereotype & act of buffoonery they could think of when they wrote this script. They had ridiculous mob & drug B.S.; pimp hairdos; the usual sistah neck popping & lip twisting; had a brotha stuttering; had farting scenes; spoke of boogas, basically they just had a script comprised of B.S. I am absolutely appalled that Glen Plummer; Clifton Powell; AJ Johnson & Clyde Jones who was an exec. producer would even be a part of such B.S. These guys are old enough & have been in the industry long enough to know we as black people are trying to get away from ridiculous crap like this. Bottom line, they should damn well know better than to humiliate themselves & the race with some B.S. like this!",1334966400,,1450,4.231046931407942
