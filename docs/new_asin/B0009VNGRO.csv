2325109,3,B0009VNGRO,"I love Tony's Power Half Hour bun video. So I couldn't wait to try his Ab burner. But I was disappointed. I thought I would be sore and feel pulled tight the next day as I have with other Ab workouts, but I didn't feel the burn. I love that Tony realizes you need to burn the fat around the middle and not just tighten the muscles. He did include cardio for this purpose but I think I needed longer periods of time engaging my ab muscles to really get a burn. I am sure some people would really welcome the cardio segments because it is a break from the burn.",1294704000,2,559,4.045045045045045
2325110,5,B0009VNGRO,"When getting this, please remember that this is one of the first BB workouts...There's no glamour and such, and Tony does come off sounding a little corny, although he is upbeat and trying to keep it from being boring--which it isn't. It's constant moving and switching of routines and they WORK...The bottom line is THEY DO WORK.

I couple these with my TJ workouts for a more challenging routine and it works. He starts with a warm up, standing ab routine and then it's the floor...Take things at your own pace and fitness level and you'll be alright. I'm also going to be doing Power 90.

Again, these routines work. I own the set on 1 dvd. You will see results...Just don't let the ""corniness"" get to you. Like I said, he's just trying to keep things upbeat and stay enthusiastic.",1231891200,11,784,4.553191489361702
2325111,5,B0009VNGRO,"I've been working out with this video every other day. for 3 weeks now, and my abs are forming and developing nicely.. Thank you Tony Horton and thanks to your crew.. i know i will have my six pack real soon. and most of all my back doesn't hurt. im getting fine as ever.....THANKS",1225497600,6,281,4.222222222222222
2325112,5,B0009VNGRO,"I have the complete Power Half Hour set (all included on 1 DVD) and these are tough little workouts!

The Ab Burner combines Cardio circuits w/ Ab circuits.

This combination makes sense because since there is no such thing as ""spot reduction"" of bodyfat, truly you need to actually burn calories to lose fat all over, then the ab work you do has a chance of actually being seen.

Of course you have to eat cleanly as well as workout or there's no way  most people will ever see results, but from the workout end of things, this program (and the others in the Power Half Hour Series) really delivers!

If you get this, be prepared to work hard. It's short but it packs a LOT of punch!",1180742400,23,684,4.3125
2325113,4,B0009VNGRO,"I own this workout and was shocked to read a bad review on it! Everyone's different, but I have done tons of workouts, and I found the quality of the workout good, and Hortons demeanor nothing short of enthusuastic and infectuous - refreshing after some workouts where they're barely moving! This is a great ab workout, even for the seasoned workout vet. I'd recommend it highly.",1147824000,12,379,4.757575757575758
2325114,3,B0009VNGRO,"The video (DVD version) is grainy, with poor sound. Coupled with Mr. Horton's goofy demeanor, it seems like an amateur production. The workout itself is tough and fast-paced, as advertised.",1145318400,5,189,5.333333333333333

2325118,1,B0009VNGRO,I am not sure how to review - I did not read carefully to see it was VHS - so I could not use. Gave it away.,1424044800,,108,3.037037037037037
2325119,5,B0009VNGRO,"Oh my goodness! I am so glad I bought this dvd, Tony Horton is an amazing and engaging instructor! I am seeing results and have only been doing the work out for about a week and a half..I cannot stress enough how much I love this work out!",1413936000,2,239,4.0
2325120,4,B0009VNGRO,"Efficient half hour workout -- aerobic and abs rolled into one.  Good when you don't have a lot of time.  Typical Tony Horton -- repetitive comments and a not a huge variety in the exercises, but good results if you stick with it.  Turn off the sound, put on some music, and you're good to go.",1383955200,,293,4.196428571428571
2325121,5,B0009VNGRO,I had the whole Power Half Hour series on one dvd. It got broken and I loved it so much that I wanted to get them individually! It is a great target workout and perfect for days when you can't get to the gym or outside for a run!,1365379200,,229,3.693877551020408
2325122,5,B0009VNGRO,"Quick half hour to get you started and is a great workout.  I haven't had it long so I can't say about results, but I do feel sore the next day.",1363824000,,144,3.6451612903225805
2325123,3,B0009VNGRO,"The video is definitely used. It skips about 5 minutes of the dvd, which in a workout dvd is kind of a big section. I'm a little upset that it skips, I have to pause my workout just to sit and rewind up until the part it skipped.
i knew the dvd was used, but i wish they would have written it in the description.
The workout itself is great and the item shipped quickly",1353024000,,369,3.933333333333333
2325124,5,B0009VNGRO,This is a killer ab workout.  This workout is not for the faint of heart.  It is also a great cardio workout.  I love this DVD.  I do it 5 or 6 times a week. Worth every penny that I spent.,1346112000,,189,3.5365853658536586

8067481,3,B0009VNGRO,"I found this workout to be on the boring side and with too much repetitive movements.  Tough workouts can be fun.  This wasn't.  Also, Tony has one move he just repeats and repeats.  It's being in a squatting position and jumping around 180 degrees.  I don't think this is an especially effective movement for people wanting to strengthen their abs.  Plus, it was repeated soooooo many times, that one of my knees was sore afterwards, even though I have no knee problems. And, yes, I was landing lightly on my feet.  I gave this review 3 stars because overall it's a good workout.  But, there are newer and better ones out there, and that will be more enjoyable to do.",1468368000,,668,4.508333333333334

8067484,2,B0009VNGRO,I love You workouts...have some from their beginning... But this was a little bit more I can handle.. I was rear ended last year and  my knees have not been the same.. So the high steps.. bending at the knees is not for me right now.. But I'm getting stronger and may be able to tackle it..but not now,1460332800,,301,4.101694915254237
