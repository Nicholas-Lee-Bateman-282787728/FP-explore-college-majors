2633024,5,B000HC2LGW,"Enjoyed getting to relive all the Looney Tunes memories.  It is a good value for the price.  For those of us who don't want to invest in the Gold collection or can't afford it, it is a good alternative.  Enjoyed Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Bugs and the gang.  Has plenty of toons to keep the kids busy for a while, and plenty for an adult to watch.  The two dvds contain 28 cartoons.  Was very pleased with this purchase!",1201392000,6,416,4.269230769230769
2633025,5,B000HC2LGW,Great stuff for the Bugs bunny fan.  Lots of good old cartoons.,1178668800,4,63,4.25
2633026,4,B000HC2LGW,"I have the Golden Collections Volumes 1-3.

They are all fine sets. A little less of the prime era 40's- 50's classic cartoons' as the series continues on each release.

 Sure, you'll get filler as Warner is going to mix some to make more volumes. As long as it's reasonable, that's business.

 The inclusion of a full disc of Speedy Gonzales- is not useful to me. A single cartoon would have been fine. A wasted DVD in the full set.

 Would have liked more Daffy Duck. More Bugs/Daffy War Era too.

 The 2 disc Spotlight with many good Bugs Bunny will do the job this time.",1163376000,27,574,4.339622641509434
2633027,4,B000HC2LGW,"I panned the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume Four since it contained an anusually large portion of useless Speedy Gonzales toons. I was pleased to find that all the 40s-mid 50s jems of that collection to be contained in this Spotlight Collection. It was nice to be given the choice. Whoever chose the ""picks"" for the Spotlight Collection did a pretty good job. A star removed for not including 8 Ball Bunny, Southern Fried Rabbit and Plane Daffy.",1161734400,16,453,4.82051282051282
2633028,5,B000HC2LGW,"I'm glad to see that volume four will be coming out in the same schedule as the other sets have been. It's going to take ten years to get all of these box sets out and it's pleasing to see that the studio is sticking to a routine schedule in getting them to us.

I understand everyone's frustration with too much or too little variety in these box sets. But volume four, just like any of the other volumes, on it's own is not the entire collection. Once all ten box sets are released (as they announced they'll release), we'll then have the whole collection. Like a disc is part of the box set, here the box set is part of the collection.

For this reason, I believe the themed discs and packaging are perfect the way that they are. It takes so much time to digitally restore each of these cartoons, months in fact, that it's taking the studio years to do it. But once all of it comes together in the end, I believe this will be one of the greatest DVD collections of all time. Just give it time and the whole picture will come together. All the discs will be organized and arranged in certain themes. It'll be beautiful. Good job Warner Bros. Keep it up!",1159574400,12,1155,4.245454545454545
2633029,5,B000HC2LGW,"I bought the first 3 golden collections, but this time around there are no Tex Avery cartoons included and only two Bob Clampetts. Luckily, this cheaper collection collects both Clampett cartoons for half the price. And personally, I doubt I'll be able to stomach an entire disc of Speedy Gonzales. Yepa! Yepa! You no like-a my cartoons, gringo?",1157328000,17,345,4.9655172413793105
2633030,3,B000HC2LGW,"With aninimated cartoons going the way they are today, we definitely often forget about what made a great cartoon from the past. While so many people are interested in cartoons like Spongebob Squarepants, and The Fairly Oddparents, many have forgotten about the great from the 40's and 50's like Tom & Jerry, Droopy, and especially the Looney Tunes from Warner Brothers. It has been a definitive shame that so many have not seen these great gems for the past. That shame has also been shown with Warner's release of their smaller Spotlight Collection DVD's highlighting as alternatives for their acclaimed Golden Collections. Now, there is another one and this one misses the mark it got away from last time.

Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 4, takes a step back to the smaller collection of Looney Tunes gems, that delivers half of the best gems from their upcoming Golden Collection Volume 4. The move is a dissapointment, especially compared to last year when Warner Brothers wisely made the smaller collection, into a pair of great movies: Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie, and Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie 1,001 Rabbit Tales. The collection still consists of several great cartoons, mostly from Bugs himself in cartoons from Sahara Hare and the Mark Twain parodied Knight-Mare Hare, which was loosely based on A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. Although there are other great gems here too from Go Fly A Kit, and Dough Ray Me-Ow as well, but not enough to tackle the funny bone.

All in all, the Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection is not bad as a sampler, for anybody who either can't afford the bigger Golden Collection Volume 4, or just hasn't seen any of these great classic cartoons from thepast. Still, I would much rather insist you buy the Golden Collection Volume 4 when it comes out in November. That is all folks.

I would highly recommend if you are wanting to buy the entire spotlight collection that you get them in a bundle they are normally cheaper that way. Also each of the collections do have an episode that over laps here and there. Even if your not a collector its a good collection to have.

2633232,5,B000HC2LGW,"I think today's cartoons are horrible. So when I realized these were available, I ordered several different Looney Tunes collections. Now when our grandson comes down to visit and the weather is bad, he has some GOOD cartoons to watch. He enjoys them, as much as I did when I first saw them as a child.

2633234,4,B000HC2LGW,"I enjoyed this Spotlight I think more than my little son, but then he is not even two. He does watch some Looney Tunes and so this will be good when gets a bit older. He likes the opening theme song to each cartoon and dances. The first disc has more of Bugs and the other has a variety of cat tunes. So disc one is a little better I think.

(I own the first three Golden Collection but didn't think half of the 4th volume was something I'd enjoy, hence, I bought this Spotlight version.....and don't regret it.)

Bugs Bunny is almost as good, and then you have Slyvester, Pussyfoot, and the mice Hubie and Bertie.....but if you love these old Looney Tunes, this disc is worth it for Dodsworth, alone.",1266883200,6,529,4.813186813186813
