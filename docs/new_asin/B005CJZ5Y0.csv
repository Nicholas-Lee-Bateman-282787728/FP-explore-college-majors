8465511,1,B005CJZ5Y0,"A disappointing video of a seminar given somewhere.  I had hoped for a vibrant video given directly for the DVD watcher.  Mr. Rollnick takes a long time to warm up, asking about people in the audience who aren't seen by the DVD watcher.  He also refers to written material not available to the DVD watcher and there are long silences as he interacts with the live audience.  We already had poor videos for the training of motivational interviewing, this is just another poor and boring training material.  I wish there was an MI movie that was interesting for staff training.  Can I return this?",1408665600,3,595,4.673076923076923
