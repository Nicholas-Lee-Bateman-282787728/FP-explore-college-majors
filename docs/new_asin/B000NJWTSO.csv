2771125,5,B000NJWTSO,"I own Biology 101 and it's an excellent overview of life on this earth.
Wes Olson has a knack for presenting information in an easy to understand and remember format.  He is interesting to watch and listen to and the his occassional sprinkling of humor keeps things light.  This is not an indepth study, but the careful, logical presentation of the basics make you want to know more. I highly recommend this series to families with children.",1207526400,16,441,4.714285714285714
2771126,5,B000NJWTSO,"I found the material (DVD and booklet) excellent. I would encourage students to follow the booklet's advice and read additional books to fill in areas more completely. I used the additional textbook from Apologia Education Ministries ""Exploring Creation with Biology, 2nd edition"" - [...] but I feel that Biology 101 could stand on it's own with supplemental reading.",1207526400,11,367,5.344827586206897
2771127,5,B000NJWTSO,"I am grieved to see a bad review of this product. This study is taught from a creationist point of view and that is not hidden, they also take the logical step in presenting biology in order of creation. This does not undermine the facts, information and education presented in the DVD, it supplements it.  It is a wonderful tool to teach Biology to students. We have been using it as part of a Co-op for high schoolers and it is excellent. All of the students are coming away with an excellent education. [...] gives an outstanding summary of the product and how to use the DVD series.
I enjoyed the DVD so much, I wrote to the company hoping they were working on an entire science series.",1207526400,32,690,4.390625
2771128,5,B000NJWTSO,"Our whole family enjoyed this program which consists of multiple DVD's and a workbook that backs up the video content and includes chapter quizzes. The content is logically presented, well photographed and includes some humor  to keep it all flowing. When my kids were in school we'd haul it out once a year to review and enjoy the material again. This aids in teaching the younger aged kids that may not have gotten it all the first time. This repetition is one way that these educational DVD's can really benefit the users.

If you are looking for heavy Darwinism, this is obviously not going to be the program for you. The content is scientific and current, but it is framed within a Christian creationist perspective. For some families this may be all your children would need for a middle or high school level biology curriculum. For others it would be a good, fun and educational introduction and you could follow with more advanced texts as needed.

We used Wes's Chemistry course too and it was excellent.  Id definitely recommend it as well.",1207526400,9,1050,4.752747252747253
2771129,5,B000NJWTSO,"An informative, fact-filled overview of biology from a creationist perspective. Suitable and engaging for all; family viewing. It is instructive, and gives literal meaning of Latin names, basic diagrams etc;
it is delivered in an informative, retainable and engaging manner. Guide book and quizzes enforce and support the content. Extremely well presented and instructive. Enjoyed immensely by all!!

2771130,5,B000NJWTSO,"Our family really enjoyed Biology 101.  It was very well done and filled with information that held our interest.  My husband and I learned along with our 13 year old.  It even captured the attention of our 4, 3, and 2 year olds with all the beautiful video.  I highly recommend this to any one with or interested in a biblical world veiw. It's a great supplement to any library, but especially of those who homeschool.  It was well worth the money and will be watched over and over again in our household.  I, too, hope Wes Olson produces more of these quality, educational video.",1207526400,6,581,4.485714285714286
2771131,4,B000NJWTSO,Biology 101 was very well done and quite interesting. I'm glad I bought the set. The man who did the series didn't overwhelm you with a lot of scientific facts and he made things pretty easy to understand. The set that I bought came with a printed study guide and this was very helpful for referring back to. I'm hoping he does another series in chemistry or something.,1207440000,7,369,4.4411764705882355

2771133,5,B000NJWTSO,"Smart, entertaining, visually compelling, and educational -- at a great pace. This series made learning interesting and fun for our kids and relaxing and enjoyable for Mom and Dad. Highly recommended!",1192665600,19,200,5.483870967741935
2771184,1,B000NJWTSO,"Believing in something does not make it true.  Faith has little to do with science.  If you want to believe in something that's great.  Now prove it!  That's science.  Believing in something does not make it true or false.  Words in a book do not make it true or false.  A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not ""guesses"" but reliable accounts of the real world.  Is there a single entity that created everything?  Probably not.  Is there an advanced civilization that came here to earth and genetically designed us?  That is much more plausible but still not fact.  It is much more probable that ""God"" is a relative term based on the comparison between us and a much more advanced civilization that to us would be Godlike.",1415836800,3,909,4.8311688311688314

2771186,1,B000NJWTSO,Science deals with the natural world.  Science does not acknowledge the supernatural. It is very sad that people indoctrinate their children with things that are not true.,1366243200,6,171,5.333333333333333
2771187,5,B000NJWTSO,"Wondeful seires that the whole family will enjoy AND learn from. If you, as a parent had a skethcy education, this will help! Yes, it is from a Biblical Christian perspective so if you are afraid of that then don't buy it.",1337299200,5,222,4.309523809523809
2771188,5,B000NJWTSO,"We have been using this curriculum for our 15 year old during the current school year. It has been a nice surprise for a student who  has no interest in science and was dreading the study of biology from a textbook.

I looked at this set and thought about it for several months before purchasing, because I wanted to be sure it would be:

1) interesting
2) easy to follow
3) a full credit course for high school
4) NOT a textbook

I must say it's more than I hoped for! We printed out the guidebook and put it in a 3-ring binder for extra study. We also follow the suggested extra activities to make it a complete course (library books, videos, field trips, extra studys, etc.).

The DVDs are wonderful, and very entertaining on their own. My other children, ages 3, 6, and 11 even sit and watch them with their older sister. Wes uses a great blend of easygoing personality, humor, and science according to the days of creation to present a video series that is exactly what this Christian homeschool mother was searching for.

The guidebook provides a great recap of the material presented in each section of the DVDs. Each section has a quiz at the end, which my daughter really enjoys! The added suggested work is right along the lines of unit study/living books-type learning. No boring textbooks!

This set is good for your science loving student because it will pique their interest for more! It's great for the non-science lover because it provides a required high school course in a very enjoyable way.

The bad reviews on this product are solely based on their theological differences. If you don't believe God created the world in 6 days and that all of science originates with creation, then, NO, this product is not for you.

If, however, you do believe in God and creation and that all life stems from Him, you will be more than satisfied with this curriculum.

I am even more excited now that I know a Chemistry 101 has been produced and Physics 101 is on its way!",1325635200,50,1978,4.530898876404494
2771189,5,B000NJWTSO,"Wes Olson's presentation of Biology is creative, funny, inspiring, and informational.  My children laughed so many times and were totally immersed in the subjects presented.  His visuals are vibrant and ""real world"".  His settings are specific to what he is teaching.  No boring textbooks!!!  You actually see what he is speaking about.  Let's face it, we are mostly a visual culture anymore.  My children love books, but this seems rare.  Seeing the subject engages more of the brain and makes the learning more effective.  Excellent for all families, home schooled or not.  If you want to stir the hearts of your children to want to know more about the world they live in, this is definitely part of the answer.  Good news!!!  Wes Olson just released Chemistry101 and it is Superb!!!  Both of these are a must have.  I am so thankful I bought them.  My 11 year old excitedly picked up the Periodic Table of the Elements and boasted about knowing what it is all about after watching just part of Chemistry101.  He couldn't wait to watch more.  Great Job Wes and team!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chemistry-101-An-Overview-of-God-s-Chemical-World/dp/1450785085/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chemistry 101: An Overview of God's Chemical World</a>",1318809600,7,1285,5.541237113402062
2771190,4,B000NJWTSO,"I watched these DVDs over and over when I took a Biology class at NorthEastern IL University and I got an ""A"" at the end of the semester!!!  Hows that for a DVD thats made for Grade School and High School kids?!!
Growing up, I was never really good in Math or Science classes, so I avoided taking these classes in college.  But these DVDs really helped me understand the subject and took out some of the fear.
Watching these DVDs never bored me, in fact I watched it over and over because it got me fascinated.
I highly recommend these DVDs to parents who have kids in Grade School, High School, and even College whos having a hard time understanding Biology and are scared of it.
These DVDs will explain it CLEARLY and SIMPLY for them.",1307577600,32,736,4.364963503649635
2771191,5,B000NJWTSO,"I love this curriculum.  It is so interesting and is taught from a view I believe in.  My daughter is currently using this for high school.  It is very well designed and the videos are very interesting.  It draws the student in and they don't dread doing Biology.

Thanks Wes for delivering such a fabulous product for those of us that want something different and not so textbooky!",1294876800,8,382,4.5588235294117645

2771193,5,B000NJWTSO,"We used this product for the last school year and it is wonderful.  My kids really enjoyed each segment and asked to re-watch it frequently.  The segments are so vivid and beautiful and the information is complete and easy to learn.

My kids would watch each segment and prepare a mind map of the lesson.  Later  they would narrate what they had learned.  All of them did very well with the quizzes that complete each lesson.

All in all it was a very delightful class and the kids are looking forward to Chemistry 101.",1242172800,5,519,4.457446808510638
2771264,1,B000NJWTSO,"Shouldn't this have been titled ""Theology 101"" ?
This obviously has as much to do with Biological science as Paris Hilton has to do with Astrophysics. A clear attemp at bringing about confusion in order to facilitate easier indoctrination into a religious belief system.
If you want to learn Biology, study Biology from an actual Biology teacher, or Scientific DVD series.",1241308800,14,372,5.114754098360656
2771265,5,B000NJWTSO,Purchased for our Private school science class. My daughter and her teacher both raved about it. It really helped make genetics more interesting and understandable to her and her class. thanks!!,1234915200,8,194,5.290322580645161
2771266,5,B000NJWTSO,"When I first ordered Biology 101 I was skeptical.  How could a DVD presentation of boring Biology 101 really help my students.  All I can say now is ""I only wish I had it when I was in High School"".
  This presentation is excellent from the beginning to the end.  The presentation clearly refutes the theory of evolution and makes no apology for God being the Creator of all things.  Having said that though, the series is not ""preachy"" but rather a systematic view of species and the way that they live in their form and function.
  I will be using this for a larger class setting of home schooled students and am confident that they will know more about Biology in the 9 week session than spending a full year in the class room reading books and listening to an instructor.
  If you want a great Biology Course look no further - here it is!",1233705600,18,842,4.339743589743589

2771268,1,B000NJWTSO,"These dvd's go against science itself, it's another way of stating ""faith does not need any explanation or testing for the simple reason that it is faith"". I strongly discourage you from buying this product for your children, they will hate you later in life and they'll be absolutely right. God might even strike you down for it.",1230508800,11,330,4.706896551724138

2771270,5,B000NJWTSO,"We used this curriculum with our 7th grader.  I had really run out of ideas for science to fit her learning style.  This was an answer to prayer.  She actually started liking science this year.  The unfortunate part is I don't think there is anything out there, which could even compare.  I am going to try Accelerated Christian Education DVD.  I hope  Wes Olson comes out with another quality program for the remainder of her scholastic career.

The whole family was so fasinated by the content causing us to watch it for evening entertainment.",1209772800,10,545,4.723404255319149
2771271,5,B000NJWTSO,"What a great idea!  It's easier to watch a DVD than to sit in front of a textbook, and it wasn't monotone or dull.  We really appreciate its Biblical view, organizing living things by the days of creation.  Biology101 keeps things moving and is pretty entertaining, too!  It's really easy to follow, and you come away with a clear understanding of how everything fits together into the big picture.  Everytime we learned about a different living thing, a screen appeared which showed at a glance how the new concept fit into the big picture.  It was colorful and interesting.  Bravo, and thank you!  Here's your entire Biology course!  You won't be disappointed.

This is a great DVD for anyone looking for biology from a Christian-creation perspective.  I easily give it five stars.  I would love to see this company publish Physics and Chemistry DVD's.",1207872000,7,854,4.854166666666667
2771272,5,B000NJWTSO,"Biology 101 is a wonderful, easy to understand and assimilate overview of Biology. Our family enjoyed this interesting series immensely and found it very helpful. This systematic, yet digestable approach is very refreshing for Biology students who are overwhelmed by the tediousness of learning the difficult subject matter. Biology 101 presents the material in a manner that is easily grasped and remembered. This would be an excellent series to embark upon before, during, or after your child takes High School Biology to enhance understanding. This also can be used as a full High School Biology course if the 114 page Guidebook, which is included on Disc#4, is followed (we had the Guidebook printed out at office supply store inexpensively).

But Biology 101 was not even remotely rigorous: more like an armchair visit to the zoo. That was OK for our purposes though, as my son wanted a break from the hard work, and an easy overview of Biology, but if you want something more meaty for highschool, this is not it.

Not very in depth and, while I believe in God as creator and that science and the Bible work together very well, I would have liked to have seen some evidence to be presented... not just a ""believe it because I said so"" approach.  I knew that this curriculum takes the young earth view of creation before I purchased it, I would have expected more in the way of scientific data and the actual study of life than the author's opinion without sufficiently backing it up scientifically.  By no means is this a complete high school level (or even middle school) curriculum, so if that's what you're after, look elsewhere.  I was expecting that for $65 I would be getting something more complete, but this was definitely not worth the money in my opinion.  If you have the extra cash and want a video supplement then maybe this is right for you.",1424304000,9,904,4.521472392638037
