8028386,2,B0002KPIC8,"A lonely housewife unknowingly has a one nighter with her best friend's killer.  Obsession, stalking and death ensue.  Before you can say that's all there is, that's pretty much all there really is.  Standard story lines apply: adulterer's guilt and fear, spouse's anger and disbelief, killer's mother fixation, etc, etc (you get the idea).  Lead performances range from decent enough (Corbin Bernsen, Claudia Christian) to over the top (Nicholas Celozzi, or I should say `over kill' since he plays the killer).  TV B movie quality.  Ron Perlman has a small role as a Detective and gives his character some nice quirks (it wouldn't surprise me if they weren't scripted and he did them simply to entertain himself). Buy it cheap for one of those on hand ""rainy day"" movies.",1104278400,5,772,4.945736434108527
8028387,2,B0002KPIC8,"This is a pretty good mid-budget film about a married woman played by Claudia Christian who has an affair with a looney-tune. She suspects that not only is the crazy-man is stalking her but that he has been killing other women. Ron ""Hellboy"" Pearlman shows up as the detective investigating the murders.

The movie is fairly interesting and has an interesting cast: Corbin Bernsen as the husband and Dick Van Patten (remember ""8 is Enough""?) as the family friend. But then the movie commits hari-kiri at the end in a way that makes the whole exercise a waste of time. Too bad.

At least Claudia C. looks really good in this film.",1100476800,5,629,4.607142857142857
