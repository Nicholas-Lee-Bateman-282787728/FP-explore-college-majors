8275325,5,B00005QART,I don't know why but at many internet sites this tape is being labeled as part of the DBZ Babidi saga?? Tha Babadi saga has 4 tapes and they're all out...we have to wait till december 18th for Majin Buu saga. Anyway after a long hard tournament we have come to the finals. Little Goku has surprised everyone and made it to the finals to face the mysterious Jackie Chun. Jackie swears he isn't Master Roshi and hell Oolong and Yamcha even see Roshi in the stands watching right? Haha! What ensues on this tape is a great battle pitting teacher vs. student. Is little Goku destined to go on and win his first attempt at the tourney title of is expirience and wisdom enough to guide Jackie Chun past his pupil and to the title. Great fight and it gets a little silly(Goku uses his tail as a propeeler at one point) but it's great action and it will have you on the edge of your seats waiting to find out who the winner will be! And Bulma's there too!,1002153600,,947,4.237569060773481
