3000630,4,B000XCZGVS,"Robert Stone's ""Oswald's Ghost"" (released on DVD on January 15, 2008, by PBS Home Video) is a documentary film that I enjoyed very much.

It's filled with an abundance of archival film footage surrounding the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, with some of this footage belonging in the ""very rare"" and ""never before seen"" drawers (at least as far as my exposure to JFK assassination footage is concerned). Details about some of these rare clips are discussed later in this review.

The 82-minute ""Ghost"", a part of PBS-TV's award-winning ""American Experience"" series, swiftly and efficiently takes the viewer through the ""four dark days"" in November of '63, when America lost its 46-year-old leader in Dallas, Texas, after two of the three gunshots fired by Lee Harvey Oswald found their mark and ended the short life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

Director Stone (who also produced and wrote the film) tells the still-fascinating tale of those four days in Dallas through a combination of the previously-mentioned archival film and video clips and recent interviews with several authors, newsmen, historians, and assassination researchers (such as Dan Rather, Edward Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Norman Mailer, Robert Dallek, Hugh Aynesworth, Gary Hart, Priscilla McMillan, and a few others).

There's a general anti-conspiracy and ""Oswald Acted Alone"" feeling that permeates the film, but ""conspiracy"" talk is woven into Mr. Stone's film many times, by way of some of the new interviews and older news footage.

We hear Mark Lane, Josiah Thompson, and Jim Garrison (among others) giving their opinions about how a grand plot took John Kennedy's life in Dealey Plaza.

So, although filmmaker Robert Stone is a believer in the ""lone assassin"" scenario (and admits as much point-blank during an interview that's included as a bonus on the DVD), ""Oswald's Ghost"" lets the conspiracists have their say (or at least a few of them anyway), which makes this a film, IMO, that shouldn't necessarily be deemed totally worthless by hardline conspiracy theorists, nor by most of the members of the ""Anybody But Oswald"" club.*

* = Although, having stated the above, author and long-time conspiracy advocate&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-J-Groden/dp/0140240039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert J. Groden</a>, after seeing a special preview of the movie in November 2007, was quoted as saying that the film is ""a horrible, horrible piece of crap"".

And Mr. Groden is even shown on camera a couple of times in the film, and not in an especially bad light either. He also gets some air time in one of the DVD's special features.

So Groden's vitriolic reaction to the film has me shrugging my shoulders in bewilderment a tad bit.

My favorite quote from ""Oswald's Ghost"" is this one by soft-spoken author Priscilla McMillan:

""He {Lee Oswald} had done very difficult things in his life, and he'd done them alone. Anybody who thinks that he wasn't capable of planning something and carrying it off alone....is wrong.""

McMillan is unique to the ""JFK"" world in multiple ways. In addition to being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marina-Oswald-s-biographer/dp/0553119567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marina Oswald's biographer</a>, she not only interviewed Lee Oswald personally in Russia in 1959, but she also knew and worked for a young Senator from Massachusetts named Jack Kennedy in 1953.

McMillan, therefore, is almost certainly the only person in the world who had personal contact with both JFK and his assassin.

There's a very good short and to-the-point observation made by Edward Epstein in the film too -- ""After forty years, none of the {conspiracy} theories pan out.""

Perhaps films like ""Oswald's Ghost"" and Vincent Bugliosi's hefty but magnificent 2007 lone-assassin book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reclaiming-History-The-Assassination-Of-President-John-F-Kennedy/dp/0393045250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Reclaiming History: The Assassination Of President John F. Kennedy""</a>, can reduce (by at least a few notches) the ridiculously-high percentage of people in America who still believe that a conspiracy existed to kill JFK in Dallas.

The percentage of conspiracy believers is approximately 75%, as of the latest Gallup poll, taken in November of 2003.

--------------------------------------

Here's a selected sampling of some of the rare video and film footage (plus some rarely-heard audio clips too) that is scattered throughout ""Oswald's Ghost"":

>> Some vivid color film clips of President Kennedy's flag-draped casket on its caisson during one of the weekend's solemn processions through Washington, D.C.

>> A brief color clip of President Lyndon Johnson placing flowers on JFK's grave, filmed sometime after Kennedy's funeral (probably in 1964).

>> There's a fantastic 1966 black-and-white BBC-TV excerpt of Mark Lane arguing with Warren Commission counsel member Arlen Specter about the controversial Single-Bullet Theory. David Belin of the WC can also be glimpsed briefly in this clip.

>> 1991 behind-the-scenes footage, in color, on the set of Oliver Stone's blockbuster movie, ""JFK"". A portion of an interview with Director Oliver Stone is included here too.

>> Rare 11/22/63 audio excerpts from the Dallas Police Department radio tapes (recorded just after JFK was shot).

>> Audio recording of a drugged Perry Russo (""star"" witness for Jim Garrison at the Clay Shaw trial in 1969). (This is a howl too.)

>> A segment from CBS-TV's 1964 news special, ""The Warren Report"", which aired the very day the Warren Commission's 888-page final report was made available to the public (September 27, 1964). B&W.

>> Marguerite Oswald, LHO's mother, is featured in a black-and-white news clip that's not seen too often. It includes the hilarious statement made by Marguerite at the cemetery as she was visiting the grave of her murdered son. Yes, Marguerite was distraught over her son's death, but this comment she made at the cemetery is just simply hysterical (there's no other way to define it):

""Lee Harvey Oswald, my son, even after his death, has done more for his
country than any other living human being.""

Hugh Aynesworth gets in a good jab at Marguerite's expense during this film too, when he said: ""Oswald's mother, Marguerite, was one of the weirdest people I've ever run into.""

>> There's also a B&W film snippet from a news conference with lawyer Mark Lane sitting next to his new client, Marguerite Oswald.

>> Jack Ruby, Lee Oswald's killer, can be heard in an audio recording made in 1966.

>> Two LBJ audio clips -- one of them has President Johnson talking on the phone with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 29, 1963 (the very day that Johnson created the Warren Commission to investigate JFK's murder).

The other clip, from September 18, 1964, features part of a telephone conversation between LBJ and Commission member Richard Russell, as they discuss the assassination and the soon-to-be-released Warren Report.

--------------------------------------

The number of old video/film clips that can be found in ""Oswald's Ghost"" (and the rarely-seen nature of some of these) puts me in mind of another good documentary centering on the same subject,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Murder-Of-JFK-A-Revisionist-History/dp/B000BT96PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Murder Of JFK: A Revisionist History""</a>, an award-winning film that was made in 1999 and released on DVD in February 2006.

""Revisionist"", like ""Oswald's Ghost"", is a worthy film for avid collectors of JFK-related programs too, mainly for the large amount of historic 1960s-era video and filmed material that it contains.

And a third Kennedy documentary film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Days-In-November/dp/6301969308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Four Days In November""</a>, is yet another movie that earns high marks in the ""vintage film footage"" category.

In fact, in my own personal opinion, the Academy Award-nominated ""Four Days In November"" (which was released in theaters in late 1964, less than a year after the assassination) is the cream of the crop when it comes to films or TV programs associated with the JFK assassination. I haven't seen it topped by any other movie or television documentary yet.

--------------------------------------

DVD BONUS FEATURES:

Three items are on the ""Special Features"" menu of the ""Oswald's Ghost"" DVD. Here's a quick look:

1.) ""A Visit To Dealey Plaza"" --- Now here's something that ought to appeal to conspiracy-thirsty people. This bonus, filmed in Dallas' Dealey Plaza (probably in 2007), consists of 9-and-a-half minutes of non-stop, mile-a-minute JFK conspiracy talk.

For the first seven minutes of this torture, we're treated to some nut who is perched up on the Grassy Knoll in the Plaza, armed with a thick notebook full of assorted conspiracy-flavored tripe.

This guy has got his conspiracy spiel down cold, I've got to give him credit for that, as he rattles off one unprovable theory after another, including everything from soup to nuts it would seem (much like Oliver Stone's ""let's throw in the kitchen sink too"" approach to the case).

Yes, it's torture to sit through to a degree....and yet this man (a Mr. Russell) is strangely compelling and easy to listen to at the same time, despite the ridiculous position he is taking regarding how the assassination of the President occurred.

And, yes, sure enough, Mr. Russell even believes that ""Umbrella Man"" was part of the covert plot to kill Kennedy....and he also believes that the ""three tramps"" were a major part of the murder plot too, including the fable about one of the tramps being E. Howard Hunt.

The tramps, of course, have since been fully identified as just that--tramps--and not conspirators, but tell that to Mr. Russell, who you can no doubt find on the Knoll this very minute, peddling his pro-conspiracy wares.

The final two-plus minutes of this bonus feature focus attention on famous researcher and conspiracist Robert Groden, as he gives one of his many talks to the visitors of Dealey Plaza.

Groden has set himself up a stand for selling his assassination books and goods in a nicely-shaded area on the steps that lead up the Grassy Knoll on the west side of the Plaza.

Bob doesn't talk quite as fast as our other conspiracy theorist featured in this bonus supplement, but his theories are just as preposterous and unsupportable by the evidence (of course).

Mr. Groden, for the trivia-minded out there who might not know this, was born on November 22. He turned 18 on the day of JFK's death.

So, coincidences CAN, indeed, occur. And do. ;)

~~~~~~

2.) ""The Zapruder Film And Beyond"" --- This 22-minute DVD add-on supplement is a ""talking heads"" piece, with various of the participants from the main feature (plus Louis Stokes, the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassintions) providing a dialogue about Abraham Zapruder's infamous 26-second home movie, which shows JFK being shot and killed in full color.

There's some other general ""conspiracy vs. no conspiracy"" discussion included here as well. This is pretty basic stuff. My favorite part of this bonus is when Mark Lane talks about how he took a copy of the Zapruder Film off the desk of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and then arranged for 100 copies of the film to be made and distributed ""everyplace"". <chuckle>

~~~~~~

3.) ""Interview With Robert Stone"" --- This interview lasts almost 16 minutes. Among other things, Stone talks about how he was able to unearth some never-before-seen film footage connected to the events of 11/22/63.

I think the best comment in the interview is when Mr. Stone says: ""The mantra in making the film was always, This is not a 'whodunnit'...this is a 'what the whodunnit has done to us'. That's what it's about.""

All three DVD bonus programs are presented in Anamorphic Widescreen format (1.85:1), with Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio.

FINAL ""GHOST"" ANALYSIS:

There's nothing really super-extraordinary or shocking or ultra-spectacular about ""Oswald's Ghost"". It's just a good, solid, well-constructed documentary film on the death of America's 35th President.

I suppose some people who viewed this movie wanted some kind of ""new evidence"" or heretofore-undiscovered revelation to be unveiled by Robert Stone within this film. Alas, that's not to be. And that, in my opinion, is mainly due to the following fact: There is nothing ""new"" to be unveiled concerning the way John F. Kennedy died on November 22, 1963.

JFK was shot by a lone loser named Lee Harvey Oswald. And that lone loser who hated America and its ""representatives"" just happened to own a cheap mail-order rifle and he also just happened to work in a building that overlooked the very last portion of President Kennedy's motorcade route through Dallas.

The combination of things I just mentioned above was a lethal combination. And it's also, whether you want to believe it or not, a combination of circumstances brought about by nothing except pure garden-variety coincidence and happenstance.

Lee Oswald's very own brother, Robert, said pretty much the same thing during an interview a few years ago:

""It is my belief--my conviction--no one but Lee was involved--period. .... He had problems at home. He had problems on his job. He was completely frustrated about what was going on around him. This is not EXCUSING what he did. This is UNDERSTANDING what he did. He wanted to be somebody. And this opportunity came about coincidental. Nothing planned. Nothin' organized. It HAPPENED that way. It's one of those happenstances of history."" -- Robert Oswald; 2003

So, if you want to watch a well-made, non-sensationalistic documentary about President John F. Kennedy's murder and the events associated with it, you'll certainly want to pick up this DVD.

If you want sensationalism and lots of complicated and impossible-to-pull-off conspiracy plots, then I'd suggest opting for the 1991 movie ""JFK"" (helmed by that other director named ""Stone"").

3000631,1,B000XCZGVS,"Robert Stone's new documentary, Oswald's Ghost (PBS), is another attempt by the establishment media to obscure the facts of the Kennedy assassination. Stone shows us Oswald's face a million times, gives the floor to grandfatherly authorities who claim ""no new evidence"", and smears conspiracy theorists in a series of slick hypnotic sequences. The passion and work of these independent researchers is nowhere seen in this visually adroit but ahistorical, lopsided, propagandistic defense of the Warren Report.

In the 1970s, it was revealed by government investigation that the CIA had 400+ ""assets"" working in the US media. One wonders how many assets are ranking propagandists and content gatekeepers in the much expanded US media today, including PBS.

Caesar was not assassinated by a lone centurion; he was attacked by senators. When a nation inherits the mantle of empire, as the US did after WWII, the stakes are raised and the power much coveted. When Kennedy fired Allen Dulles and planned to dismantle his powerful CIA, which had begun to overstep its directive, they went after him. They brought in ""defector"" Oswald conveniently as a patsy, gave him FBI ties to keep Hoover at bay, sent a crew to Dallas, removed Kennedy's usual security detail, and shot him in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.

What has turned this simple conspiracy into a 44-year-old ""haunting"" is the media's continuing collusion with the government in the subsequent coverup: muddying the waters with countless phony conspiracy theorists who introduced false leads (LBJ did it! the Mafia did it!) to the discredit of the research community; maintaining a 44-year blackout on so much evidence that has come forward; dancing around the facts and treating the American public like children, for some irrational fear that they should learn the truth and actually participate in democracy. Oswald's Ghost merely extends the coverup.",1200441600,10,1913,5.2655737704918035
3000632,2,B000XCZGVS,"Not an investigation and no new insights here, but true to the title, this is a look at the lingering presence of the mystery of Oswald and the assassination that will forever link him with JFK.

The implied conclusion (big surprise) of this PBS broadcast film is that Oswald acted alone but that we are not psychologically able to grasp that fact since recent polls suggest 70% of Americans think otherwise.

None of the big lingering mysteries of that day are explained or explored.  Are there high tech forensics that can be used today to look at the event?  Not touched on.

Only the varying opinions of those involved as newscasters or lawyer and authors.  Some glaring contradictions are not followed up like Dan Rather's incorrect original description of the head-snap of JFK after seeing the Zapruder film.  Rather is interviewed for the film but not asked that question even though it is pointed out in a vintage clip.

And has anyone done stress analysis audio tests on Oswald's recorded vocal denial of any involvement in the assassination?

Some of the vintage footage is especially sharp.

3000656,4,B000XCZGVS,"""Oswald's Ghost"" combines fascinating new archival footage with a different and unique approach to the JFK assassination. It makes for a very interesting documentary by director Robert Stone. It contains more of Lee Harvey Oswald's public appearance after his arrest and prior to his death than I have seen in any other documentary.

Stone, in an interview that is part of the bonus feature, explains what makes this documentary unique in substance and narrative compared to other documentaries and books about the assassination.  This documentary is not about ""Whodunit.""  It is how the assassination negatively affected public opinion about our government and its credibility long after November 22, 1963.

The JFK assassination, followed by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King in 1968, the deviousness of LBJ in conducting the Vietnam War, and the election of Richard Nixon have all been woven into a historical narrative over time that produced a cynicism about our government that continues to thrive today in the American public at large.

Stone doesn't advocate or necessarily believe this narrative. Tom Hayden, a former SDS founder, comes closest to expressing the narrative. Stone more importantly demonstrates that perception often becomes reality, rightly or wrongly. Those reviewers who have spent time making ""ad hominem"" attacks on the various people interviewed are missing the point.

This an even-handed documentary featuring the some of the most recognized names associated with the JFK assassination and the subsequent radical student movement: Mark Lane, J. Edward Epstein, Norman Mailer, Tom Hayden, and Gary Hart.

Epstein, who published one of the first conspiracy books is a very interesting interview throughout.  His book was overpowered by Mark Lane's ""Rush to Judgment"", but he is one of the most prominent JFK conspiracy buffs. Epstein does not concede that Oswald was a lone gunman but he does express an opinion that is a forceful argument for the lone gunman theory.  At the end of the documentary he notes that after forty years none of the conspiracies have been proven.

Mailer's commentary borders on the poetic and reminds us of the beauty of his written prose.  He provides the most eloquent vision of the whole affair and quite rightly is the person to sum up the meaning of the specter of Oswald's ghost.

As stated in the documentary, people generally have a very hard time accepting the fact that the death of  a charismatic young person like JFK can die  at the mundane hand of a lone, lunatic gunman. There is a natural human tendency to believe that the death of such a prominent and charismatic person must be the result of a larger conspiracy.

The death of Princess Diana and the seemingly interminable investigations and conspiracy theories regarding it is symptomatic of the same feeling that has driven the JFK conspiracy hunts for forty years.  It is a feeling that
a beautiful, almost fairy-tale like princess could not have died in something as mundane as a traffic accident.

You will be missing a very interesting and significant addition to the JFK assassination history if you miss this documentary.

Note to all the conspiracy theory reviewers:  I do not work for the government, I am not CIA or army intelligence. I am not part of the continuing ""cover-up."" I was not the one on the ""grassy knoll"".  I have never tried to profit from JFK's assassination.",1217894400,3,3438,5.094474153297683
3000657,3,B000XCZGVS,"Oswald's Ghost is not, on the surface, just another documentary on the assassination of John F. Kennedy seeking to prove one theory or another.  Yet while the film ostensibly is not on the whodunit but that question ahs done to us, Oswald's Ghost has a definite bias in it.  But even if on disagrees with this interpretation of the facts, there is still something to be watched here.

Director Robert Stone seems to have done his homework. His interviews cover many proponents of both sides of the argument. He also goes a step further to present unseen or rarely seen / heard materials including news clips and the actual Dallas police recordings. Stone also chooses to employ some interesting visual techniques in the film as well. For example there is the whirlpool of Oswald and Warren Commission images at the start of the film,  the (apparent) black hole of conspiracy books, and the positive / negative effect on stock footage during the playing of the recording of Perry Russo's sodium pentothal questioning.  These make the film visually interesting and watch-able, even if one doesn't agree with the facts as presented.

Thus the film's fault lies in its bias. While Stone does offer the conspiracy theorists plenty of screen time to defend their views and for the most part I'll admit the film is pretty even handed.  Yet in the last few minutes of the film, Stone seems convinced that the mystery is solved and has been for nearly forty-five years. The film then proceeds to essentially say that independent researchers (that is to say conspiracy theorists) have led the public on a wild goose chase of truly epic proportions.  Stone takes the viewer from a fair-minded look at the how the specter of the Kennedy assassination looms over America to a biased attempt to prove Oswald acted alone in the assassination.

Would the film have been better without this bias? That's hard to say, really. I suspect that one's own opinion on the topic determines how one interprets the film. While one can argue over the factuality of the film, it is visually striking in its presentation as if to shock and awe. At times fair and at times biased, Oswald's Ghost is not for all tastes.  But for anyone interested in the assassination, the film should be seen.",1203465600,5,2261,4.789203084832905

3000659,1,B000XCZGVS,"I was very disappointed that this film was shown within the American Experience films which I've always regarded as a fine program of historical value.  However this film was exceptionally biased especially when it presented its conclusions which had vey little supporting evidence. The producer also spent a lot of time trying to ridicule conspiracy proponents such as the piece on Garrison. It did not explain the single bullet theory (because scientifically it can't be explained) and spent the last 15 minutes presenting its conclusions without presenting opposing views.  Another attempt to whitewash history of the Kennedy assassination . How about a film which presents all the evidence and have a detailed scientific analysis of the data such as the autopsy records for Dallas doctors versus DC doctors, physics of the single bullet theory, acoutic evidence of the shooting,. And find someone who could repeat the assassination (shooting duimmies) from the book repository building window in the time sequence in which the assassination occured using the weapon or replica which Oswald was proposed to have used.",1201305600,12,1120,5.357954545454546
3000660,1,B000XCZGVS,"To me the most irritating thing about the movie is what I call ""genre creep"" (It is a relative of the late 1970s tax term bracket creep)

It starts out saying that its purpose it not to takes sides in the debate between LN's and CTers: its supposedly noble purpose is to show the delibilitating effect on the American ""left"" (Note that the rightwing doesn't seem to NEED such paternalistic gatekeeping)

And the aim is to keep it that way.  It does not surprise me that Stone aims his film at left liberals.  That is where there has been a history of gatekeeping operations (witness Encounter magazine, before you scoff) And no this does not mean that Stone was a willing collaborator in a dinisinformation campaign.  Who knows where along the chain of decision making that allowed this film to be seen by millions the disinformation came in.  And no it cannot be said with certain that it was conscious disinformation. Yet the Encounter's focus on a similar left-liberal firewall strategy<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cultural-Cold-War-The-CIA-and-the-World-of-Arts-and-Letters/dp/B000OVLNK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</a>&nbsp;to prevent further left curiosity about the CIA suggests it, as does the new book called The Mighty Wurlitzer about CIA domestic front groups.

Just how many American experience films to you see THAT ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES FURTHER PERSUIT OF A TOPIC?  The timing is understandable, what with Harvard University Press about to publish David Kaiser's PRO-CONSPIRACY ANALYSIS and with Jeff Morley of the WaPost offering similar evidence in his new book Our Man in Mexico about the CIA Station Chief in Mexico City Win Scott, things are getting pretty desparate  for the Lone Nutters.  Their only solution is to dissuade the younger crowd by saying ""conspiracy theory"" and saying flying saucers as per the X-files formula that is finally wearing away.

Then it proceeds to give ""both sides of the story"" using outdated sources for the CT side.

Then, while clearly having won its own match-- umpired by itself it denies that any match occured at all and the intention was just to investigate a debilitating psychological state.

This is what is so gutless. It gives an biased point of ""both sides of the story"" and then denies it had any intention of passing judgement. This might well be what disingenuous means.",1201219200,14,2445,5.286821705426356
3000661,4,B000XCZGVS,"The above title is a paraphrase of film maker Robert Stone's own explanation about what compelled him to make this seductive and oddly unnerving documentary.  He says it at the end of his 16 minute interview which is part of the bonus material on the newly released DVD of 'Oswald's Ghost'  The film itself is not so much about who did or did not kill JFK, although Stone comes out, on the wings of some beautifully cadenced articulation from Norman Mailer, with a plausibly reasoned narrative that shows Oswald was far more intelligent, educated, motivated and therefore capable of soley killing one of the most popular presidents of the century than most of us would ever care or dare to suspect. But whether or not this may sway your JFK conspiratorial or anti conspiratorial belief system, his real aim is to look at the nature and actual necessity of the conspiracy theory itself, something which all the anti-establishment and pro establishment theorists never seem to have done

JFK's assasination was a national trauma rivaled only by 911, but what made it most appaling was millions of people like myself, then in high school, had to witness the subsequent assasination of prime suspect Lee Harvey Oswald by some Dallas saloon operator on national live tv.  The impact of those four days is immeasurable, but Stone should be applauded for exploring what this meant to a decade, a generation and ultimately an entire society to the present day.

His film is not able, nor motivated, to cover all the narratives, let alone all the angles of the most common narratives that spun out of those days on our collective political subconscious, but his sharp film making and archive footage research skills project us into a realm where we get an uneasy sense of the anger, anxiety and paranoia that the assasination and its twisted aftermath took us through  - virtually to the edge of a kind of national psychosis.

I first saw the film in a theatre and whether you have seen it there or on The American Experience, there is still something to be gained from watching the DVD with its bonus material.  One segment, titled ""A Visit to Dealey Plaza"" has a feeling that we are watching a 19th century side (I am tempted to say freak) show, where a fast talkin' barker spins a whole cloth conspiracy rant that lassoes Nixon, LBJ, J Edgar Hoover, Howard Hunt, Lamar Hunt and Woody Harrelson's dad altogether in a book of pictures and headlines that we can neither see nor read. He wraps it up as few can do outside of Texas with "" As they say at Hallmark: We Care Enough to Send the Very Best, and We Sure Didn't Hire any Amateurs to Kill our President"". Hysterical stuff, except that many people, myself included, have tended to believe all or most of it at some point or another, and can still be easily swayed, even after watching Oswald's Ghost several times.

The fingering of LBJ as conspirator (who sealed off the investigation being done on him soon as he was sworn in) is interesting because in Stone's film, former White HOuse reporter Robert Dallek describes LBJ as one establishment official who didn't swallow the Warren Commission's finding, and became sufficiently paranoid enough of theories involving Castro and the Soviets that he became delusionally obsessed with showing his prowess in Vietnam.  There's one not so oft cited glimpse at how the events and our need to make sense out of things that don't add up effect not only our thinking, but our history.  Stone makes an even stronger observation at the end of his interivew when he talks about how the belief by 70% of our population that Oswald did not act alone has impacted how we think even of today's historic presidential election.  So many people younger people that he has talked with in the lasst year or two who are not old enough to remember 1963 believe all the parties are the same, that they are all corrupt, that no one tells the truth, and therefore why participate, why vote?  This sort of 21st century malaise is not something that Robert Stone was able to explore deeply in Oswald's Ghost, but perhaps more than anything, it justifies a title whose legacy only seems to grow more unsettling through time.",1200700800,9,4193,4.727397260273973

Oswald's surrogate father, Charles ""Dutz"" Murret, worked as a bookie for Carlos Marcello's organization in New Orleans, but when he was interviewed by the Warren Commission no one bothered to ask him about that. Ruby was clearly connected to Mafia leaders such as Giancana, Roselli and Trafficante.

3235127,4,B000XCZGVS,"Robert Stone's ""Oswald's Ghost"" (released on DVD on January 15, 2008, by PBS Home Video) is a documentary film that I enjoyed very much.

It's filled with an abundance of archival film footage surrounding the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, with some of this footage belonging in the ""very rare"" and ""never before seen"" drawers (at least as far as my exposure to JFK assassination footage is concerned). Details about some of these rare clips are discussed later in this review.

The 82-minute ""Ghost"", a part of PBS-TV's award-winning ""American Experience"" series, swiftly and efficiently takes the viewer through the ""four dark days"" in November of '63, when America lost its 46-year-old leader in Dallas, Texas, after two of the three gunshots fired by Lee Harvey Oswald found their mark and ended the short life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

Director Stone (who also produced and wrote the film) tells the still-fascinating tale of those four days in Dallas through a combination of the previously-mentioned archival film and video clips and recent interviews with several authors, newsmen, historians, and assassination researchers (such as Dan Rather, Edward Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Norman Mailer, Robert Dallek, Hugh Aynesworth, Gary Hart, Priscilla McMillan, and a few others).

There's a general anti-conspiracy and ""Oswald Acted Alone"" feeling that permeates the film, but ""conspiracy"" talk is woven into Mr. Stone's film many times, by way of some of the new interviews and older news footage.

We hear Mark Lane, Josiah Thompson, and Jim Garrison (among others) giving their opinions about how a grand plot took John Kennedy's life in Dealey Plaza.

So, although filmmaker Robert Stone is a believer in the ""lone assassin"" scenario (and admits as much point-blank during an interview that's included as a bonus on the DVD), ""Oswald's Ghost"" lets the conspiracists have their say (or at least a few of them anyway), which makes this a film, IMO, that shouldn't necessarily be deemed totally worthless by hardline conspiracy theorists, nor by most of the members of the ""Anybody But Oswald"" club.*

* = Although, having stated the above, author and long-time conspiracy advocate&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-J-Groden/dp/0140240039/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert J. Groden</a>, after seeing a special preview of the movie in November 2007, was quoted as saying that the film is ""a horrible, horrible piece of crap"".

And Mr. Groden is even shown on camera a couple of times in the film, and not in an especially bad light either. He also gets some air time in one of the DVD's special features.

So Groden's vitriolic reaction to the film has me shrugging my shoulders in bewilderment a tad bit.

My favorite quote from ""Oswald's Ghost"" is this one by soft-spoken author Priscilla McMillan:

""He {Lee Oswald} had done very difficult things in his life, and he'd done them alone. Anybody who thinks that he wasn't capable of planning something and carrying it off alone....is wrong.""

McMillan is unique to the ""JFK"" world in multiple ways. In addition to being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marina-Oswald-s-biographer/dp/0553119567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marina Oswald's biographer</a>, she not only interviewed Lee Oswald personally in Russia in 1959, but she also knew and worked for a young Senator from Massachusetts named Jack Kennedy in 1953.

McMillan, therefore, is almost certainly the only person in the world who had personal contact with both JFK and his assassin.

There's a very good short and to-the-point observation made by Edward Epstein in the film too -- ""After forty years, none of the {conspiracy} theories pan out.""

Perhaps films like ""Oswald's Ghost"" and Vincent Bugliosi's hefty but magnificent 2007 lone-assassin book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reclaiming-History-The-Assassination-Of-President-John-F-Kennedy/dp/0393045250/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Reclaiming History: The Assassination Of President John F. Kennedy""</a>, can reduce (by at least a few notches) the ridiculously-high percentage of people in America who still believe that a conspiracy existed to kill JFK in Dallas.

The percentage of conspiracy believers is approximately 75%, as of the latest Gallup poll, taken in November of 2003.

--------------------------------------

Here's a selected sampling of some of the rare video and film footage (plus some rarely-heard audio clips too) that is scattered throughout ""Oswald's Ghost"":

>> Some vivid color film clips of President Kennedy's flag-draped casket on its caisson during one of the weekend's solemn processions through Washington, D.C.

>> A brief color clip of President Lyndon Johnson placing flowers on JFK's grave, filmed sometime after Kennedy's funeral (probably in 1964).

>> There's a fantastic 1966 black-and-white BBC-TV excerpt of Mark Lane arguing with Warren Commission counsel member Arlen Specter about the controversial Single-Bullet Theory. David Belin of the WC can also be glimpsed briefly in this clip.

>> 1991 behind-the-scenes footage, in color, on the set of Oliver Stone's blockbuster movie, ""JFK"". A portion of an interview with Director Oliver Stone is included here too.

>> Rare 11/22/63 audio excerpts from the Dallas Police Department radio tapes (recorded just after JFK was shot).

>> Audio recording of a drugged Perry Russo (""star"" witness for Jim Garrison at the Clay Shaw trial in 1969). (This is a howl too.)

>> A segment from CBS-TV's 1964 news special, ""The Warren Report"", which aired the very day the Warren Commission's 888-page final report was made available to the public (September 27, 1964). B&W.

>> Marguerite Oswald, LHO's mother, is featured in a black-and-white news clip that's not seen too often. It includes the hilarious statement made by Marguerite at the cemetery as she was visiting the grave of her murdered son. Yes, Marguerite was distraught over her son's death, but this comment she made at the cemetery is just simply hysterical (there's no other way to define it):

""Lee Harvey Oswald, my son, even after his death, has done more for his
country than any other living human being.""

Hugh Aynesworth gets in a good jab at Marguerite's expense during this film too, when he said: ""Oswald's mother, Marguerite, was one of the weirdest people I've ever run into.""

>> There's also a B&W film snippet from a news conference with lawyer Mark Lane sitting next to his new client, Marguerite Oswald.

>> Jack Ruby, Lee Oswald's killer, can be heard in an audio recording made in 1966.

>> Two LBJ audio clips -- one of them has President Johnson talking on the phone with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 29, 1963 (the very day that Johnson created the Warren Commission to investigate JFK's murder).

The other clip, from September 18, 1964, features part of a telephone conversation between LBJ and Commission member Richard Russell, as they discuss the assassination and the soon-to-be-released Warren Report.

--------------------------------------

The number of old video/film clips that can be found in ""Oswald's Ghost"" (and the rarely-seen nature of some of these) puts me in mind of another good documentary centering on the same subject,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Murder-Of-JFK-A-Revisionist-History/dp/B000BT96PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Murder Of JFK: A Revisionist History""</a>, an award-winning film that was made in 1999 and released on DVD in February 2006.

""Revisionist"", like ""Oswald's Ghost"", is a worthy film for avid collectors of JFK-related programs too, mainly for the large amount of historic 1960s-era video and filmed material that it contains.

And a third Kennedy documentary film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Four-Days-In-November/dp/6301969308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Four Days In November""</a>, is yet another movie that earns high marks in the ""vintage film footage"" category.

In fact, in my own personal opinion, the Academy Award-nominated ""Four Days In November"" (which was released in theaters in late 1964, less than a year after the assassination) is the cream of the crop when it comes to films or TV programs associated with the JFK assassination. I haven't seen it topped by any other movie or television documentary yet.

--------------------------------------

DVD BONUS FEATURES:

Three items are on the ""Special Features"" menu of the ""Oswald's Ghost"" DVD. Here's a quick look:

1.) ""A Visit To Dealey Plaza"" --- Now here's something that ought to appeal to conspiracy-thirsty people. This bonus, filmed in Dallas' Dealey Plaza (probably in 2007), consists of 9-and-a-half minutes of non-stop, mile-a-minute JFK conspiracy talk.

For the first seven minutes of this torture, we're treated to some nut who is perched up on the Grassy Knoll in the Plaza, armed with a thick notebook full of assorted conspiracy-flavored tripe.

This guy has got his conspiracy spiel down cold, I've got to give him credit for that, as he rattles off one unprovable theory after another, including everything from soup to nuts it would seem (much like Oliver Stone's ""let's throw in the kitchen sink too"" approach to the case).

Yes, it's torture to sit through to a degree....and yet this man (a Mr. Russell) is strangely compelling and easy to listen to at the same time, despite the ridiculous position he is taking regarding how the assassination of the President occurred.

And, yes, sure enough, Mr. Russell even believes that ""Umbrella Man"" was part of the covert plot to kill Kennedy....and he also believes that the ""three tramps"" were a major part of the murder plot too, including the fable about one of the tramps being E. Howard Hunt.

The tramps, of course, have since been fully identified as just that--tramps--and not conspirators, but tell that to Mr. Russell, who you can no doubt find on the Knoll this very minute, peddling his pro-conspiracy wares.

The final two-plus minutes of this bonus feature focus attention on famous researcher and conspiracist Robert Groden, as he gives one of his many talks to the visitors of Dealey Plaza.

Groden has set himself up a stand for selling his assassination books and goods in a nicely-shaded area on the steps that lead up the Grassy Knoll on the west side of the Plaza.

Bob doesn't talk quite as fast as our other conspiracy theorist featured in this bonus supplement, but his theories are just as preposterous and unsupportable by the evidence (of course).

Mr. Groden, for the trivia-minded out there who might not know this, was born on November 22. He turned 18 on the day of JFK's death.

So, coincidences CAN, indeed, occur. And do. ;)

~~~~~~

2.) ""The Zapruder Film And Beyond"" --- This 22-minute DVD add-on supplement is a ""talking heads"" piece, with various of the participants from the main feature (plus Louis Stokes, the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassintions) providing a dialogue about Abraham Zapruder's infamous 26-second home movie, which shows JFK being shot and killed in full color.

There's some other general ""conspiracy vs. no conspiracy"" discussion included here as well. This is pretty basic stuff. My favorite part of this bonus is when Mark Lane talks about how he took a copy of the Zapruder Film off the desk of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and then arranged for 100 copies of the film to be made and distributed ""everyplace"". <chuckle>

~~~~~~

3.) ""Interview With Robert Stone"" --- This interview lasts almost 16 minutes. Among other things, Stone talks about how he was able to unearth some never-before-seen film footage connected to the events of 11/22/63.

I think the best comment in the interview is when Mr. Stone says: ""The mantra in making the film was always, This is not a 'whodunnit'...this is a 'what the whodunnit has done to us'. That's what it's about.""

All three DVD bonus programs are presented in Anamorphic Widescreen format (1.85:1), with Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio.

FINAL ""GHOST"" ANALYSIS:

There's nothing really super-extraordinary or shocking or ultra-spectacular about ""Oswald's Ghost"". It's just a good, solid, well-constructed documentary film on the death of America's 35th President.

I suppose some people who viewed this movie wanted some kind of ""new evidence"" or heretofore-undiscovered revelation to be unveiled by Robert Stone within this film. Alas, that's not to be. And that, in my opinion, is mainly due to the following fact: There is nothing ""new"" to be unveiled concerning the way John F. Kennedy died on November 22, 1963.

JFK was shot by a lone loser named Lee Harvey Oswald. And that lone loser who hated America and its ""representatives"" just happened to own a cheap mail-order rifle and he also just happened to work in a building that overlooked the very last portion of President Kennedy's motorcade route through Dallas.

The combination of things I just mentioned above was a lethal combination. And it's also, whether you want to believe it or not, a combination of circumstances brought about by nothing except pure garden-variety coincidence and happenstance.

Lee Oswald's very own brother, Robert, said pretty much the same thing during an interview a few years ago:

""It is my belief--my conviction--no one but Lee was involved--period. .... He had problems at home. He had problems on his job. He was completely frustrated about what was going on around him. This is not EXCUSING what he did. This is UNDERSTANDING what he did. He wanted to be somebody. And this opportunity came about coincidental. Nothing planned. Nothin' organized. It HAPPENED that way. It's one of those happenstances of history."" -- Robert Oswald; 2003

So, if you want to watch a well-made, non-sensationalistic documentary about President John F. Kennedy's murder and the events associated with it, you'll certainly want to pick up this DVD.

If you want sensationalism and lots of complicated and impossible-to-pull-off conspiracy plots, then I'd suggest opting for the 1991 movie ""JFK"" (helmed by that other director named ""Stone"").

3235128,1,B000XCZGVS,"Robert Stone's new documentary, Oswald's Ghost (PBS), is another attempt by the establishment media to obscure the facts of the Kennedy assassination. Stone shows us Oswald's face a million times, gives the floor to grandfatherly authorities who claim ""no new evidence"", and smears conspiracy theorists in a series of slick hypnotic sequences. The passion and work of these independent researchers is nowhere seen in this visually adroit but ahistorical, lopsided, propagandistic defense of the Warren Report.

In the 1970s, it was revealed by government investigation that the CIA had 400+ ""assets"" working in the US media. One wonders how many assets are ranking propagandists and content gatekeepers in the much expanded US media today, including PBS.

Caesar was not assassinated by a lone centurion; he was attacked by senators. When a nation inherits the mantle of empire, as the US did after WWII, the stakes are raised and the power much coveted. When Kennedy fired Allen Dulles and planned to dismantle his powerful CIA, which had begun to overstep its directive, they went after him. They brought in ""defector"" Oswald conveniently as a patsy, gave him FBI ties to keep Hoover at bay, sent a crew to Dallas, removed Kennedy's usual security detail, and shot him in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.

What has turned this simple conspiracy into a 44-year-old ""haunting"" is the media's continuing collusion with the government in the subsequent coverup: muddying the waters with countless phony conspiracy theorists who introduced false leads (LBJ did it! the Mafia did it!) to the discredit of the research community; maintaining a 44-year blackout on so much evidence that has come forward; dancing around the facts and treating the American public like children, for some irrational fear that they should learn the truth and actually participate in democracy.

None of the big lingering mysteries of that day are explained or explored.  Are there high tech forensics that can be used today to look at the event?  Not touched on.

Only the varying opinions of those involved as newscasters or lawyer and authors.  Some glaring contradictions are not followed up like Dan Rather's incorrect original description of the head-snap of JFK after seeing the Zapruder film.

3235153,4,B000XCZGVS,"""Oswald's Ghost"" combines fascinating new archival footage with a different and unique approach to the JFK assassination. It makes for a very interesting documentary by director Robert Stone. It contains more of Lee Harvey Oswald's public appearance after his arrest and prior to his death than I have seen in any other documentary.

Stone, in an interview that is part of the bonus feature, explains what makes this documentary unique in substance and narrative compared to other documentaries and books about the assassination.  This documentary is not about ""Whodunit.""  It is how the assassination negatively affected public opinion about our government and its credibility long after November 22, 1963.

The JFK assassination, followed by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King in 1968, the deviousness of LBJ in conducting the Vietnam War, and the election of Richard Nixon have all been woven into a historical narrative over time that produced a cynicism about our government that continues to thrive today in the American public at large.

Stone doesn't advocate or necessarily believe this narrative. Tom Hayden, a former SDS founder, comes closest to expressing the narrative. Stone more importantly demonstrates that perception often becomes reality, rightly or wrongly. Those reviewers who have spent time making ""ad hominem"" attacks on the various people interviewed are missing the point.

This an even-handed documentary featuring the some of the most recognized names associated with the JFK assassination and the subsequent radical student movement: Mark Lane, J. Edward Epstein, Norman Mailer, Tom Hayden, and Gary Hart.

Epstein, who published one of the first conspiracy books is a very interesting interview throughout.  His book was overpowered by Mark Lane's ""Rush to Judgment"", but he is one of the most prominent JFK conspiracy buffs. Epstein does not concede that Oswald was a lone gunman but he does express an opinion that is a forceful argument for the lone gunman theory.  At the end of the documentary he notes that after forty years none of the conspiracies have been proven.

Mailer's commentary borders on the poetic and reminds us of the beauty of his written prose.  He provides the most eloquent vision of the whole affair and quite rightly is the person to sum up the meaning of the specter of Oswald's ghost.

As stated in the documentary, people generally have a very hard time accepting the fact that the death of  a charismatic young person like JFK can die  at the mundane hand of a lone, lunatic gunman. There is a natural human tendency to believe that the death of such a prominent and charismatic person must be the result of a larger conspiracy.

The death of Princess Diana and the seemingly interminable investigations and conspiracy theories regarding it is symptomatic of the same feeling that has driven the JFK conspiracy hunts for forty years.  It is a feeling that
a beautiful, almost fairy-tale like princess could not have died in something as mundane as a traffic accident.

You will be missing a very interesting and significant addition to the JFK assassination history if you miss this documentary.

Note to all the conspiracy theory reviewers:  I do not work for the government, I am not CIA or army intelligence. I am not part of the continuing ""cover-up."" I was not the one on the ""grassy knoll"".  I have never tried to profit from JFK's assassination.",1217894400,3,3438,5.094474153297683
3235154,3,B000XCZGVS,"Oswald's Ghost is not, on the surface, just another documentary on the assassination of John F. Kennedy seeking to prove one theory or another.  Yet while the film ostensibly is not on the whodunit but that question ahs done to us, Oswald's Ghost has a definite bias in it.  But even if on disagrees with this interpretation of the facts, there is still something to be watched here.

Director Robert Stone seems to have done his homework. His interviews cover many proponents of both sides of the argument. He also goes a step further to present unseen or rarely seen / heard materials including news clips and the actual Dallas police recordings. Stone also chooses to employ some interesting visual techniques in the film as well. For example there is the whirlpool of Oswald and Warren Commission images at the start of the film,  the (apparent) black hole of conspiracy books, and the positive / negative effect on stock footage during the playing of the recording of Perry Russo's sodium pentothal questioning.  These make the film visually interesting and watch-able, even if one doesn't agree with the facts as presented.

Thus the film's fault lies in its bias. While Stone does offer the conspiracy theorists plenty of screen time to defend their views and for the most part I'll admit the film is pretty even handed.  Yet in the last few minutes of the film, Stone seems convinced that the mystery is solved and has been for nearly forty-five years. The film then proceeds to essentially say that independent researchers (that is to say conspiracy theorists) have led the public on a wild goose chase of truly epic proportions.  Stone takes the viewer from a fair-minded look at the how the specter of the Kennedy assassination looms over America to a biased attempt to prove Oswald acted alone in the assassination.

Would the film have been better without this bias? That's hard to say, really. I suspect that one's own opinion on the topic determines how one interprets the film. While one can argue over the factuality of the film, it is visually striking in its presentation as if to shock and awe. At times fair and at times biased, Oswald's Ghost is not for all tastes.

And the aim is to keep it that way.  It does not surprise me that Stone aims his film at left liberals.  That is where there has been a history of gatekeeping operations (witness Encounter magazine, before you scoff) And no this does not mean that Stone was a willing collaborator in a dinisinformation campaign.

He says it at the end of his 16 minute interview which is part of the bonus material on the newly released DVD of 'Oswald's Ghost'  The film itself is not so much about who did or did not kill JFK, although Stone comes out, on the wings of some beautifully cadenced articulation from Norman Mailer, with a plausibly reasoned narrative that shows Oswald was far more intelligent, educated, motivated and therefore capable of soley killing one of the most popular presidents of the century than most of us would ever care or dare to suspect. But whether or not this may sway your JFK conspiratorial or anti conspiratorial belief system, his real aim is to look at the nature and actual necessity of the conspiracy theory itself, something which all the anti-establishment and pro establishment theorists never seem to have done

JFK's assasination was a national trauma rivaled only by 911, but what made it most appaling was millions of people like myself, then in high school, had to witness the subsequent assasination of prime suspect Lee Harvey Oswald by some Dallas saloon operator on national live tv.  The impact of those four days is immeasurable, but Stone should be applauded for exploring what this meant to a decade, a generation and ultimately an entire society to the present day.

His film is not able, nor motivated, to cover all the narratives, let alone all the angles of the most common narratives that spun out of those days on our collective political subconscious, but his sharp film making and archive footage research skills project us into a realm where we get an uneasy sense of the anger, anxiety and paranoia that the assasination and its twisted aftermath took us through  - virtually to the edge of a kind of national psychosis.

I first saw the film in a theatre and whether you have seen it there or on The American Experience, there is still something to be gained from watching the DVD with its bonus material.  One segment, titled ""A Visit to Dealey Plaza"" has a feeling that we are watching a 19th century side (I am tempted to say freak) show, where a fast talkin' barker spins a whole cloth conspiracy rant that lassoes Nixon, LBJ, J Edgar Hoover, Howard Hunt, Lamar Hunt and Woody Harrelson's dad altogether in a book of pictures and headlines that we can neither see nor read. He wraps it up as few can do outside of Texas with "" As they say at Hallmark: We Care Enough to Send the Very Best, and We Sure Didn't Hire any Amateurs to Kill our President"". Hysterical stuff, except that many people, myself included, have tended to believe all or most of it at some point or another, and can still be easily swayed, even after watching Oswald's Ghost several times.

The fingering of LBJ as conspirator (who sealed off the investigation being done on him soon as he was sworn in) is interesting because in Stone's film, former White HOuse reporter Robert Dallek describes LBJ as one establishment official who didn't swallow the Warren Commission's finding, and became sufficiently paranoid enough of theories involving Castro and the Soviets that he became delusionally obsessed with showing his prowess in Vietnam.  There's one not so oft cited glimpse at how the events and our need to make sense out of things that don't add up effect not only our thinking, but our history.  Stone makes an even stronger observation at the end of his interivew when he talks about how the belief by 70% of our population that Oswald did not act alone has impacted how we think even of today's historic presidential election.  So many people younger people that he has talked with in the lasst year or two who are not old enough to remember 1963 believe all the parties are the same, that they are all corrupt, that no one tells the truth, and therefore why participate, why vote?  This sort of 21st century malaise is not something that Robert Stone was able to explore deeply in Oswald's Ghost, but perhaps more than anything, it justifies a title whose legacy only seems to grow more unsettling through time.",1200700800,9,4193,4.727397260273973
3235159,2,B000XCZGVS,"In 1991, Hollywood director Oliver Stone presented a visually stunning but ultimately disjointed analysis of Pres. Kennedy's assassination in his film, ""JFK.""
Now documentarian Robert Stone has also lavished viewers with an array of rare and spectacular visuals while totally eschewing any real search for the truth.
PBS owes it to America to re-examine the JFK murder and its cover-up in a more objective manner. Simply follow the separate paths of Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby and see where they lead.
Oswald's surrogate father, Charles ""Dutz"" Murret, worked as a bookie for Carlos Marcello's organization in New Orleans, but when he was interviewed by the Warren Commission no one bothered to ask him about that. Ruby was clearly connected to Mafia leaders such as Giancana, Roselli and Trafficante. The Mafia was working with CIA agents to kill Castro, and Oswald had a myriad of contacts with both pro- and anti-Castro Cubans, U.S. military intelligence, KGB, FBI etc.
The plot thickens.
Check out the work of historians Peter Dale Scott, James DiEugenio, Lamar Waldon, David Scheim, John Davis and Larry Hancock, to name a few.
Robert Stone's documentary was slickly produced, but poorly informed.

8227905,4,B000XCZGVS,"In 2008, PBS broadcast the documentary ""Oswald's Ghost,"" by Robert Stone.  Lee Harvey Oswald may well be the most mysterious public figure of the Twentieth Century.

Mr Stone here elegantly puts forth his conclusion about the catastrophe, abetted by Norman Mailer, Dan Rather, etc.  But of what value is any conclusion regarding the accused assassin of President Kennedy?  The lies told for a half-century about this man and the assassination are apparently endless.  Even recently, books have arrived purportedly about Oswald that are patently fictitious.

One key to Oswald is his birth and upbringing here in New Orleans.  The morbid atmosphere of the city has given birth to great figures as well as troubling figures.  In words caught by recorders in the police station in Dallas following his arrest, one can hear Oswald pronounce ""asked"" as ""axed,"" as in various local dialects.  The grandiosity combined with abject failure seem to be a familiar character flaw in the Deep South.  And while Oswald was apparently intelligent, he was perhaps dyslectic, leading to a constant frustration.

Oswald has now often been portrayed in the cinema, and this reviewer believes the finest example is that of Jeremy Strong, in ""Parkland"" (2013), since, as I recently wrote, ""he is inscrutable and somewhat fey.""  We will never know the secrets of this ambiguous man.

The original score for this documentary was composed by Gary Lionelli, and is exceptional.  Nevertheless, toward the end of the film, the ""Lacrimosa"" from Mozart's Requiem is heard, in the recording by Riccardo Muti.  It is an extraordinary choice, and we can reflect on the text:

Filled with weeping will be that day
When from the ashes shall arise
The guilty man to be judged.
Therefore, spare him, O God:
Merciful Lord Jesus,
Grant them rest.",1498953600,,1809,5.081355932203389

8227912,2,B000XCZGVS,"This film about the Kennedy asssasination starts out well but fails to live up to its promise.  The second half of the film seems to ignore the evidence discussed in the first half.  For example, the Zapruder film and other evidence which is touched on in the first half is ignored in the second half.  For example, it discusses the glaring contradiction of Dan Rather's incorrect original description of the head-snap of JFK after seeing the Zapruder film, which suggests at least two directions for the shooting, hence the involvement of at least two gunmen. Rather is gently interviewed and not asked whether he had rethought his earliest statement in light of subsequent evidence.

The hastily tacked on conclusion is largely narrated by CIA apologist Norman Mailer, who manages to ignore a lot of evidence.
 Not an investigation but more an attempt to reposition Oswald at the center of the JFK assassination.  Too many other more in depth examinations have suggested otherwise, and this film, unsuccessfully for me, attempts to redress the balance.

I'm giving this film 2 stars because its enhanced Zapruder footage is especially clear compared to many previous films, and also some of its interviews are enlightening.  But really a far better, 4.5 star exploration of the assassination is the History Channel's 2 DVD ""Men Who Killed Kennedy,"" which is far more faithful to the evidence it presents.",1391817600,,1406,5.0562770562770565

The interview with Robert Stone, the filmmaker is the best. We couldn't stop laughing at this nitwit. He is clueless of his own subject matter. He doesn't even believe a conspiracy existed. What a moron. But then here is PBS putting this on with all the fanfare and credentials of the American Experience. Hey, maybe they should be defunded.

""Oswald's Ghost"" is a polished, glossy history of how the conspiracy theories started and why. The film doesn't provide any new answers. Instead, it seeks to understand why controversy still swirls around the Kennedy assassination 45 years after it was allegedly solved.

That search for answers has been an important chapter in American History, and thus ""Oswald's Ghost"" is a welcome addition to the American Experience series.
