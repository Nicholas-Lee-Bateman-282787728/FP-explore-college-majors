I am waiting. And I am waiting for the next seasons of Fantasy Island as well. These great shows need to be available for those of us  who would prefer some of the older, fun and well done shows over the stuff that is unwatchable and not worth turning on the TV for nowadays.  I could watch the Love Boat and Fantasy Island (AND Love, American Style) over and over and never be tired of the episodes. They all were so funny with classic comedy and drama that were pitch perfect and so well produced, (Aaron Spelling, of course!).

Bring on the next seasons, PLEASE! VERY SOON!  We need them!",1405814400,2,867,4.354037267080745

3874457,5,B0028SVY3E,"If romance, a few laughs and lots and lots of T.V. and movie stars float your boat, then ""The Love Boat"" is for you.

In this second half of season two, Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Doc (Bernie Kopell), Isaac (Ted Lange), Julie (Lauren Tewes) and Gopher (Fred Gandy) join forces with a multitude of celebrities in several cute, litte stories within each hour-long episode.  Joining them in the Acapulco Lounge are:  Gilligan Island's Tina Louise, Martha Raye, the handsome Lyle Waggoner of ""The Carol Burnette Show,"" ""All My Children's"" Debbi Morgan, Lisa Hartman of ""Tabitha"" and ""Knots Landing"", Raymond Burr, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Leslie Nielsen, Peter Lawford, Reggie Jackson, Cyd Charisse and many more.

Stories feature Gopher's trouble with his parents- played by Ethel Merman and Bob Cummings, Charo returning as April (who does a guitar/song/dance number to a strange but entertaining disco version of ""The Love Boat"" theme-I kid you not), and my favorite - Julie's high school reunion.  Get out your leisure suits for a boogie wonderland, because this particular episode goes disco crazy and has some funny and inexcusable dancing going on.

There are 12 episodes here of great quality.  These shows make you unwind and relax.  They're care-free and fun.  I hope they release more of these!!",1344211200,6,1303,5.137440758293839

THIS SHOW MUST HAVE DONE MORE FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM IN THE 1980'S THEN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. EVERY WEEK THE PACIFIC PRINCESS TOOK US TO EXOTIC PLACES SUCH AS GREECE, THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, ITALY, AND ACALPULCO. AND MOVIE STARS I HADN'T EVER SEEN BEFORE WERE ON LOVE BOAT. PEOPLE LIKE CYD CHARISSE, LILI PALMER, AND ALEXIS SMITH. EVERYBODY WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. THE FOOD LOOKED SO DELICIOUS. AND THE CREW JUST SEEMED TO BE HAVING THE BEST OF TIME. THE SHOW WAS HILARIOUS, WELL WRITTEN AND VERY FUNNY. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE SHOW WAS CANCELLED. IT PLACED A VOID IN MY SATURDAY NIGHT VIEWING. THANK GOODNESS FOR DVD'S THOUGH.

This set includes the legendary double-length show (""A Good and Faithful Servant / The Secret Life of Burl Smith / Tug of War / Designated Lover""), which stars all three members of the Mills family acting dynasty - Sir John Mills, Hayley Mills and Juliet Mills.  In the show, Hayley is a famous model and the object of fantasy for Gopher (Fred Grandy).  It's a real highlight from the season.

Former stowaway April Lopez (Charo) makes her return to the Pacific Princess - this time as a professional entertainer; and we also get to meet Gopher's parents...played by none other than Ethel Merman and Bob Cummings!
