It shows what Christian worker's go through to reach these wonderful people. it is a very hard country to work in. The movie is well worth getting for any Christian person.",1372032000,,270,4.313725490196078
8151010,1,B000JJS8TW,"I bought this DVD for my World Literature class, thinking it would be a good introduction to Hinduism and its effect on the culture and literature of a nation.  What I got was ""Hinduism is nothing but Satan's playground"" through and through.  As I cannot show this to my students and can't return a viewed copy, I wasted my money.",1205280000,2,330,4.483333333333333
8151011,5,B000JJS8TW,"In ""India Face To Face"", filmmaker Jon Wood takes you to various towns and villages in India. Not to fancy resorts or the high-cast people, but to the sidewalks and slums where thousands of Indian's live every day.

Each of the nine shows has a different theme, but all emphasize the fact that more people live below the poverty line ($1.08 a day) then we would like to realize, and also how desperately they need to be introduced to their Creator, and freed from the bondage of useless rituals and penances.

While this DVD may not appeal to non-christians, or to those looking strictly for Indian culture, it did appeal to me, because as a christian, I find it inspiring and refreshing to see people spreading the good news of salvation in foreign lands.

It is, in my opinion, very educational and eye-opening, and it really challenges you to take a closer look at how most of the world lives, and what you are doing to help them.
Check it out, it's worth it.",1201132800,,962,4.517241379310345
8151012,1,B000JJS8TW,"This is Christianity pushing itself in India's face.

The entire so-called ""documentary"" is about a Christian missionary who goes to India to convert those poor stray injuns (praise jesus, hallelujah!) and save their wicked Hindu souls.

This film is so backwards in its view of India I was left with a sour taste in my mind for days afterward. This is such a horrible representation of the Indian people and culture.

Christians, Quit India!!!",1191542400,6,444,4.972972972972973
8151013,1,B000JJS8TW,"This movie is about christianity being pushed down the throats of some Indian people and ridiculing their Hindu beliefs while trying to ""sell"" them on new-testiment born-again christianity. (reminds me of the Jesus Camp nutjobs) It even has a obviously staged ""christian exorcism"" attempting to scare the locals and to convert them into being born-agains. The deceptive title would make one think they are buying a documentry about India. Instead you get a bunch of christian nutjobs trying ram their beliefs down the Indian peoples throats and yours too, if you watch this garbage. This is a prostylzing christian movie. A deceptive product, like the people whom produced it. Dont waste you money",1174867200,8,697,5.176991150442478
