8326517,3,B001J0ZGTU,"this dvd reviews 15 classic hurricane games dating back to when it all started the 1983 championship game. the commentator on the dvd does a good job telling the story for each game and putting them in to perspective, such as what the teams record was at that point whether they were underdogs or favorites etc  before showing the highlight clips. BUT the highlight clips for each game though are very short probably about 3 minutes i expected a lot more actual football highlights for each game. and many of these games you can watch 9 and 10 minute highlight clips of on youtube. so to me there should have been more bang for the buck",1315526400,,636,4.482758620689655
