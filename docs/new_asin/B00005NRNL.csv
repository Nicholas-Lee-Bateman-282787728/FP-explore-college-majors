7947705,4,B00005NRNL,"This movie is good entertainment. It's about a movie executive who wakes up  on the beach one morning after heavy partying and it seems that he committed a serious crime the previous night, but he doesn't remember anything. He makes a deal with some stranger who promises to take care of everything without it ever coming out, but as it turns out, this comes with a price, because, well, as they say: you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours... Anyway, the plot is OK, although not perhaps the greatest, but there is enough suspense to keep you watching. What I like: the leads, Nicholas Lea and Holt McCallany; Jason Priestley's directing (I think the close-ups were all in the right places and very well done); the perfectly fitting soundtrack; the visual impact. Somebody has written in his/her review that the pace of the movie was slow; well, I didn't find it slow. The twist at the end is great. There is a moment at the end (the struggle between the leads) when the viewer actually guesses what is going to happen, but the final outcome is a bit unexpected. All in all, well done, I think.",1326499200,7,1098,4.573604060913706

Well this movie is just like that it just treads along. But lets get to the nitty gritty of the story: Nicholas Lea (Dustin)is a movie executive,who is partying into the wee hours of the night with a bunch of bimbo type blondes in the back of a limousine with a bunch of his buddies. In a drunken stupor he decides to get out with one of them to take a stroll on the beach. What follows is your usual frolicking,kissing and stuff. Fast forward to the morning and our hero is wokened up by a homeless man named Minnow (Holt McCallany) with the woman lying several feet away seemingly dead. Minnow tells Dustin that he witnessed Dustin kill the woman in a fight but not to worry he would take care of the body if Dustin takes care of him. But all this is insidiously stupid to me! for why would you give someone so much leverage for a potential blackmail!! which predictably is what follows, Minnow gratiates hisself to Dustins rich life style enjoying his clothes,car,girlfriend,(Kari Wuhrer)thru all this Dustin through investigation finds he's been shammed. The victim of a cruel con now angry he plans revenge,without giving up to much of the ending I will just say it ends ironically. But what gives this movie little suspense is the basic personality traits of the main characters Dustin appears gutless and minnow appears far from menacing or intimidating and as far as Kari Wuhrer is concerned you wonder why he'd have her for a girlfriend anyway. and if you want to buy this dvd thinking she's showing her bod she isn't. This movie doesn't thrill you in any way! in my opinion just a so-so movie that could've been better.",1197504000,14,1791,4.582554517133956

I have changed my opinion of Jason Priestly from pretty boy 90210 to talented director and not so bad of an actor.  And if you're a fan of Nicholas Lea, you must have this.",1096156800,12,261,4.395833333333333
