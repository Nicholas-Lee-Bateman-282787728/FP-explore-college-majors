8094371,2,B000BYRCHO,"Back when I was a teenager with raging hormones, I thought 2069: A Sex Odyssey was an entertaining and funny film. When I saw that the film was released on DVD, I purchased it for nostalgic purposes. However, I was somewhat disappointed when I discovered that this version was edited. If you want a copy of the original film in its entirety, do not waste your money.",1463529600,,366,4.477611940298507
8094372,2,B000BYRCHO,"This movie was made before 1974.  Which mean the porn was very, very, soft.  Sexy female alien landing in german town get to have sex with the native.  Sounded good, but I have to watch a slap-stick comedy of old men chasing haft dress women in the barn, bar, police station etc...  I can't say this is move you would want to see.
""Run virgin Run"" had to some gag with no alien.",1238371200,3,378,4.136986301369863
8094373,4,B000BYRCHO,Next to Flesh Gordon this is a classic of early 70's softcore schlock cheese! Great soundtrack and decent production values for its kind of film- this is one of the better obscure b movies with some vintage sexy 70's girls. Its like Barbarella with more nudity! For the price its a steal!,1185321600,6,288,4.5576923076923075
8094374,3,B000BYRCHO,"I remember fondly seeing 2069: A Sex Odyssey during the early morning hours on Cinemax. For those not old enough to remember in the early days of premium cable channels most of their late night early morning program was comprised of foreign erotica. Emanuelle was quite a star on these channels. Now it is filled with modern soft-core comedies that fail in their attempt to even evoke a genuine chuckle.

This DVD is packed as a double feature, much in the same way these films were originally shown in drive-ins throughout the country. While many claim this movie is ""so bad it is good..."" the movie while poorly dubbed and of course incrediblu actually delivers some good laughs. Yes the movie is outlandish and yes compared to todays standards it is a poor quality but compare it to todays erotic films just a couple of minutes of dialog connecting scenes of formulaic sex and usually a non-existent plot (see Busty Cops 2).

The movie is mildly erotic by todays standards and much of what occurs is implied not shown, but it still beats the stuff that is run in the wee hours today. However; the redeeming qualities are there it is funny, the plot while outlandish serves for some excellent comedy and erotica, and is actually very well shot. For an example this erotic comedy actually contains a wacky but well shot motorcycle and ski chase.

The downside it's been edited, and the scenes I recall that were edited in this version were really nothing that needed to be cut. The original film showed no hardcore scenes. The most ironic twist in all of this is the company included the original trailer of 2069 and the trailer does include a brief glimpse of one of these cut scenes. The transfer itself is actually very good quality wise, the audio is quite clear but tends to fade in some scenes this could have been helped by including a subtitles option. It is unfortunate you have to raise the volume to hear a sentence and then frantically lower it as the next scene blows out your eardrums.

Run, Virgin, Run is another film from the old Cinemax days and it holds up well against my memory. While it has a wacky plot (One guy in a town of hundreds impregnates and satisfies ALL the women) it doesn't have the same sly one-liners or innuendos of 2069. As a solo it can't stand on it's own but as a double feature with 2069 it works.

This DVD also features original trailers of other films as well as radio spots played over a woman stripping and showering. These are an added bonus as the trailers show some fine examples of European Erotica and Sexplotation films of the 60's and 70's.

I wanted to give this a 3.5 but due to the 1-5 system it had to be a whole number. I could not warrant giving this a 4 because it was not the original of the film and the audio fading issue. Yet it is a solid piece of European Erotica that I would recommend to fans of the genre.",1170201600,14,2877,4.4600760456273765
