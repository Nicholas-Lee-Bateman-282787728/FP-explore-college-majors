646793,2,6303451489,The Blue Lagoo,922924800,,14,4.0
646794,3,6303451489,"This is the travelogue version of the venerable novel by Stacpole. It's the sort of movie to make you want to buy a ticket for a tropical holiday. Think of it as soft porn in the sun.
The young Shields plays the part of a girl marooned on a deserted tropical island, with the gorgeous hunk of Chris Atkins as the boy marooned with her. At the time of marooning, the kids are quite young so the movie inserts the character of Leo McGuigan (famous as Rumpole of the Bailey) to nurture and guide them.
Years pass in paradise, the old guy dies, and the kids grow up. Lots of flesh show as they sport on the beaches. Shields and Atkins show their buff bodies to good advantage. In one notorious scene, Atkins sits naked in Shields' lap as they slide down a waterfall, displaying all of his goodies.
The kids discover sex, do it as much as they can, and have a baby. Talk about Adam and Eve!
The bad guy shows up as a pearl fisher, who exploits Atkins to dive for the pearls without knowing their value.
Eventually the kids, and their young son, get rescued. But at the end of the movie, they return to their island paradise.
Gorgeous photography, equally split between flesh and scenery. Good for a cold winter's night, what with tropical scenery and sexy bodies to warm the viewer's heart.  END",882489600,8,1290,4.397489539748954

647141,4,6303451489,"Watched this years ago and I still enjoy seeing it. It was quite risque for 1980. What I love about the movie was the children's naivete as they aged. Some scenes are very well done . . . no speech, just the camerawork. There were certain inconsistencies, the most obvious of which was the children's clothing. Brooke Shields is 6 feet tall, and there's no way that her clothing would 'magically' grow in size to fit her. I don't think there were adult sized clothes in the trunk, but I could be wrong. Also, there was the issue of how Chris Atkins kept his facial hair shorn. Other than those two oversights, it was an excellent movie.",1521158400,,636,4.444444444444445

647286,5,6303451489,"I  love  this  movie.  It  all  starts  out  when  the  ship  that  they're  on  with  the  boys  Richard  father  who  is  the  girls  Emmeline  uncle  mysteriously  catches  fire.  &  they  have  to  abandon  ship.  &  because  of  the  smoke  which  becomes  pretty  thick  creating  a  fog  they  become  separated.  &  end  up  with  the  ships  cook  paddy.  They  arrive  at  an  island  where  they  think  they're  alone.  But  there  are  strange  native  people  which  stay  clear  &  make  they're  presence  there  seem  like  your  imagination.  Strangest  of  all  was  these  native  people  didn't  tend  to  patrol  the  island,  or  else  these  2  couple  would  of
 had  it  a  long  time  ago.  All  that  was  witnessed  that  one  night  was  seeing  what
 happens  when  one  of  the  tribe  members  goes  against  the  rest  of  them.  Some  kind  of  sacrifice.  They  were  told  not  to  go  to  the  other  side  of  the  island  where  suspicious  things  happen,  not  to  them  but  something  that  could  spell  bad  luck. Richard  calls  them  the  drum  people.  Not  quite  the  right  name  for  them.
Anyways  in  case  none  of  you  are  aware,  the  couple  that  end  up  together  &  fall  in  love  have  sex  &  then  a  baby  are  actually  related.  Cousins  the  way  I  remember  it. &  over  a  period  of  time  they  learn  lessons  about  life.  All  sorts  of  lessons.  You  take  for  example  one  of  them  is  in  a  bad  mood,  because  there  is  a  part  when
one  of  them  tells  a  lie,  then  the  girl  wants  some  private  time,  ends  up  cutting  her  foot  on  a  rock  while  swimming  in  a  pool  surrounded  by  rocky  cliffs.
They  grew  up  there  after  accepting  the  fact  that  they  may  never  be  rescued.  &  if  either  one  of  them  sees  a  ship  it  was  Richards  idea  to  get  attention  so  they  could  leave  the  island.  The  only  question  is  are  they  serious  about  getting  attention?  I  never  knew  for  sure  whether  or  not  they  wanted  to  stay  being  happy  on  the  island,  or  leave.  (Swiss  family  Robinson)  was  a  different  story.  In  the  end  we  learned  the  family  was  happy  there  for  sure.
This  movie  is  very  confusing.  Perhaps  they  do  care  too  much  about  their  loving  relationship  then  they  do  about  getting  some  ships  attention  &  being  rescued.  I  couldn't  figure  it  out  for  myself  even  if  I  wanted  to.
Perhaps  they  had  their  own  fears  of  being  discovered  by  the  drum  people.
&  they  make  the  most  out  of  life.  15  years  go  by  after  having  to  abandon  the  ship  with  the  cook  who  teaches  them  stuff,  &  knows  a  little  bit  more  about  how  to  survive  then  you  might  expect.  You  would  have  thought  that  he  wasn't  anything  more  then  a  mean  drunkard  after  trying  to  spank  the  kids  for  seeing  nude  people  in  a  magazine  just  before  abandoning  the  ship.
There  were  all  sorts  of  questions  they  were  asking  each  other.  None  of  them  really  had  the  right  answers.  The  music  in  this  movie  is  just  right.
&  the  water  is  beautiful.
After  drifting  away  from  the  island  which  they  made  their  home  they  are  picked  up  from  the  girls  uncle  &  the  boys  father  who  must  have  spent  an  awful  long  time  looking  for  them.
At  this  point  they  had  already  drifted  far  enough  away  from  the  island  that  there  was  no  point  in  going  back.
The  sequel  to  this  movie  is  called  (Return  to  blue  lagoon).
&  it  raises  a  few  questions  for  me.  Did  Richard  &  Emmeline  request  to  be  returned  to  the  island???",1489190400,,3732,4.2885906040268456

Point is, nudity is completely unnecessary and surplus to the story.  It seems it would arouse a pedophile pretty readily, and that's not something we'd want to encourage.",1476316800,3,340,4.827586206896552

647619,1,6303451489,"Blue Lagoon is 90 minutes of basically delightful things (children growing up on the beach, beautiful nature photography, a young couple working through their strange new attraction to each other, etc), followed by a 10 minute ending sequence so unbelievably sad it undoes any feelings of romance.

The plot also gets tangled up themes that are way too sober for the ""stranded in paradise"" movie that we signed up for: human sacrifice, living in fear of being murdered, man's inhumanity to man, needful suicide.  Yuck.  Even the romantic parts are so shot through with fear and frustration (bickering way past the point that it's cute, being terrified of these strange movements inside her tummy, etc.) that it gets a little hard to really sit back and buy into it.  Lacks the joy and innocence of Paradise (1982) imo - that's right, the Blue Lagoon ""ripoff.""

The ending completely disrespects the audience.  They end up adrift in the ocean and forced to choose between watching their baby die or group suicide via poison berries.  So what if they get rescued at the last second - I still had to sit through the agonizing scenes of this terrible choice.  Great job realistically depicting the worst choice a parent can ever be faced with, though!",1452211200,,1247,4.849056603773585

647623,5,6303451489,"This movie is timeless and was released the year I was born. It makes me sad that we don't make movies like this anymore. Everyone is so caught up with trying not to offend meanwhile sweet beautiful stories and visuals are not created anymore. Especially the kids and teens being fully naked on camera, it would be rated XXX in today's world because people have lost their minds. So glad to own this digitally on Amazon and to see it still available. I wish more of these were available from digital providers like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu etc... I appreciate the simplicity of it. Just a young pure love store without any perversions.

Maybe I'm crazy but all the stuff that's been going on over the last 2 1/2 decades with sex and nudity taking over the internet, tv, yet people want to make sure they are 18 because heaven forbid they are 17 haha. Where did common sense go? Where did we lose our tolerance and appreciation for beauty go? Everyone is screaming tolerance while becoming more and more intolerant. Tolerance as long as you agree with me, right? crazy!

This is an amazing, well produced and sadly lost genre of movies that I appreciate greatly. You can just in vision the kids just running around butt naked on the beach and swimming and just having a blast, right?  It's pure and real. So that's my review ;) haha  Maybe the next generation of film makers will start breaking through these walls we built and bringing us all back to reality and common sense.",1447027200,4,1473,4.568181818181818

647758,5,6303451489,"I just love this movie.  I know it may not be what some would call a 5-star movie, but it is to ME.  I saw it at the theater when I was 18, and have always been a big fan of Brooke, being in the same age group. Back in 1980, I thought it was so romantic, and I so wanted to be there with them.  I have thought of it often through the years, and recently saw the remake on Amazon, (which was... ehh).  So of course I had to rent this one to share with my daughter.  She didn't like it much.  I guess today's youngsters aren't as innocent as we were.  :-(  This is simple, like a fantasy of what if... very satisfying.  The movie itself was so beautiful, just visually stunning, and actually explores some very basic concepts that you've always wondered about like what if you didn't know anything about sex, and love, and babies, and what would happen if no one ever told you these things or corrected your childlike notions?  A lot of things I would have done differently, like the island natives, and how they lived their entire lives there without them knowing about them (which, I'm glad, because let's keep this a happy movie), and the whole uncle part was sort of unbelievable.  but those were just some floating details that they had to marginally skim over.  Simply concentrating on the main focus of this movie, it is a beautiful fantasy, and I stick by my 5 stars!  Definitely going to buy this movie to keep forever.",1444176000,,1426,4.315789473684211

Their mentor is a colorful character who provides them guidance for several years until he finally dies. The two children fight and play,  grow close, and eventually explore a sexual relationship. Though both are understandably confused about her pregnancy, they both welcome the child as it is born. Although initially wanted to be rescued, eventually the two accept their home on the Island, and even turn away from a potential rescue at one point.

That is, the two main characters are portrayed as teens, lost at sea and finally landed on an uninhabited island. They spend their days without benefit of clothing and some marvelous swimming scenes are of both two children and then two very young adults swimming in the nude. In some way it is a most beautiful story of two children who have to grow up into young adulthood having no connection at all to life in the real world. It is a fantasy but the interaction between Emily and Richard is wonderful to behold. Their coming to find themselves as sexual beings is very precious. It is sexuality seen as the gift of God it is meant to be. It also shows how boy and girl naturally grow in their affection for each other that leads to romance. The scenery is awesome and adds to the overall beauty of the story line. If you can get past the nudity in parts, you will enjoy watching this fantasy. I had to remind myself at times that these two children were left alone when they we very innocent little children.

648360,1,6303451489,"Going through some old music, I came across Basil Poledouris's ""Love Theme from 'The Blue Lagoon' (Emmeline)"" which was quite beautiful and I longed to see the movie again.  I had never seen the 1949 original with Jean Simmons and you know what they say now about remakes, but I had forgotten I had already seen the 1980 remake in the theater and did not appreciate the music as much nor even Nester Almendros's usually breathtaking cinematography and, of course, concentrated on the kids, Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, what everyone then went to see it for.  I forgot that they were not nearly as good as Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, Franco Zefferelli's young thespians when he made ""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1968 and they could really act and it was Shakespeare.  Brooke Shields went on to things, nothing weighty and Christopher Atkins soon after went off into the sunset already.  The second time watching this unfortunate story was murder.  Poledouris's music should have been heard more.  But watching it again has illustrated for me a lot of what is wrong with Hollywood then that our society has learned from awful popular movies especially the complete oeuvre of its director Randall Kleiser from ""Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" to ""Honey I Blew Up the Kids"" with the only real ""credit"" being 1978's ""Grease"" based on the stage musical.  It was commercial but carefully built its appeal to older audiences.  What that had surfaced after ""The Blue Lagoon"" in the commercialism was in 1982 with ""Summer Lovers"" which was all current songs on the soundtrack and what seemed like all future Cameron Diaz movies with Peter Gallagher as reigning beefcake (even somewhat androgynous) with the most simple plot or lack of it with those interchangeable titles, any title as good as any for just a copyrighted idea masquerading as a script or any Jennifer Aniston movie today.  Careful, V., she's stretching her acting range to play an (it doesn't add this word, but it's coming into the mix) ""aging"" stripper, or should I call it by its new politically correct word, ""a cougar.""  Anything to make the stultifying lack of entertainment and talent today more acceptable. (Anything with ""friends"" in the title or anything in the title ""friends"" do in their everyday life so we can sell it like a commodity like toothpaste and toilet paper).  I don't think there will be much future for a lot of these movies once new abominations can serve as landmarks when the new generations must look back on what it has wrought and maybe the really good things will be appreciated again even more.  Restoration should be the thing of the future.  Based on a 1903 novel by Henry DeVere Stacpoole, but more like Demi Moore's ""The Scarlet Letter.""  Color.  Columbia Pictures.

648470,5,6303451489,"I bought this film not knowing what I might find but after a few minutes in I found the most delightful film about two children who knew absolutely nothing TRUE about life. Their father, Mr. Lestrange (good name for him btw), told them nothing true about life. Babies from cabbage patches, etc. They had only a fairly good vague concept about God but a little knowledge is dangerous which it was in their case. They even fell for the idea that an idol was God. Oh how horrible! Anyway, this is the sweetest movie I have watched in a very long time. I love the ocean scenes, the Pacific shots of the sky and cocoa-palms. It all makes for an enchanting two hours. I have watched it over and over and hope to watch it again and again. I bought the sequel it would not load so I got a refund but I will review it for what I did see of it.

Chris and Brooke do a marvelous acting job in this. It was so believeable that I just know they are really living their parts. They are innocence at it's best and the nude shots are so well done that you don't feel creepy or weird while watching them do whatever life brings them. It was all so well done that it was all so sweet as it could be. Again, not much creepiness anywhere in this film except for the headhunter scenes which I could have done without. I read about Robinson Cruso and so it took me back to those awful parts in that book. But, that was soon forgotten when a sunset appeared or a shot under the ocean took my mind off the gruesomeness of life. There is darkness in life but this movie lets one take a trip to a Pacific Islands and leave all worries behind for a while and just dream about being there. I watch it for that reason. It takes me away from the mundanness of my day and I am swept away. I love it!",1377907200,12,1768,4.095100864553314

648558,5,6303451489,"I realize that many people may not agree with my rating here, at least if what you want is raw sex and a fast moving drama.  If that is what you desire, then this movie is not for you.  But if you are a sensitive person with feelings, and would like to see how it may feel to be able to live life without all the judgments and distractions of our modern society, then this drama may appeal to you, as it did with me.  It is an interesting phenomenon, when we are able to experience what is essential to understanding life in an environment where God's beauty shows through, it touches something deep inside of our heart as if to say, ""This is how God meant us to be and live!""  Is the acting perfect? No.  Is it a triple A picture?  Probably not.  But what it is may reach your heart in a way that most other movies simply cannot do.  Why?  Because it really shows everything in such an innocent and simple way that it becomes real; it shows things that in many ways are taboo in our society ... such as both the male and female bodies, but without being offensive in any way; learning about sex and having sex, while making it a beautiful and touching; and learning about the interactions and feelings of each other, which in the end results in caring and love for one another; and lastly, having a child and growing close as a family.  Simple?  Yes.  But touching, nevertheless.  Interestingly, I had a similar experience in my own life where, for the month that I spent with a cousin of mine in native bungalows in Bora Bora and Moorea (near Tahiti), we found that that simple something in this heavenly world of Polynesia can truly bring you closer to each other and to God.  We actually discovered an almost indescribable spiritual unity while swimming and living in this same kind of environment as is seen in this movie.

648563,5,6303451489,"I was 14 when this film came out so it brings back wonderful memories of being a teenager and experiencing romance with a cute girl  for the first time. Sure some of the dialogue is a bit corny but you must remember these kids were shipwrecked when they were young so their knowledge about life in general and vocabulary would be somewhat limited. Brooke Shields looks stunning(duh!) though only 14 when she filmed this in '79, and Christopher Atkins(just 18 himself) does a good job as well considering this was his first film and he and Brooke are on screen alone for 3/4 of the movie. All the nudity that some critics and detractors have complained about over the past 33 years looks perfectly natural and beautiful. The human body is nothing to be ashamed of and if you grew up in the lush Fiji tropics like Richard & Emmeline you'd be running around butt naked most of the time too. :)

What I cherish most about this film is how these kids discover the changes you go through from child to young adulthood on their own. Most of us had parents or relatives to teach us these things. Richard & ""Em"" rely on their inner feelings and stereopticon photographs to try and make sense of it all. It's confusing, frustrating, scary and exilirating all at the same time. There's something very poetic and tender about growing up in a world away from civilzation with no violence, hatred or societies pressures and expectations. It's just the laws of nature and each other.

The great thing about movies is you can love them for different reasons for example: Jaws(primal fear of the ocean),The Godfather trilogy(ultimate saga about family,revenge,sacrifice and consequences),Aliens(brilliant pacing and relentless action),Goodfellas(inner workings of mob life), Braveheart,Ben-Hur & Lawrence of Arabia(epic scope in storytelling), Annie Hall & Manhattan(honesty and complexities of relationships), just to name a few. TBL may not be on that same level but it does take me back to those days of youthful imagination and discovering girls weren't so ""icky"" after all like few films can, and for that reason alone it's one of my favorites. It connects with me emotionally each time I view it.

The recent Blu-Ray release from Twilight Time/Sony looks fabulous on Blu-Ray with it's original film grain in tact and no digital manipulation. The exotic sounds of wildlife and the ocean really come to life in dts-hdma. The discs features include an isolated musical track, short but vintage making of featurette, 2 excellent audio commentaries from Brooke & Chris and various teasers/trailers. Also have to give a big thumbs up to the wonderful score and beautiful cinematography. If you're a fan of the film then you can purchase without regret.

Plus, shipping and handling costs, of course, only taking it to about thirty five dollars.

So, if you decide to buy this from their website, just make sure that you make it clear that you don't want to be billed until the day that they ship it to you.

The beta boy probably wouldn't get any sex at all from the girl, unless he killed the alpha boy (like in ""Lord of the Flies""?), which would promote him to acting alpha boy.

648623,5,6303451489,"Yep, I really did just say that. The Blue Lagoon is a perfect film. It stands alongside Raging Bull, Wild Strawberries, and the true titans of cinematic greatness as certainly the most surprising entry in that particular canon.

It's a shipwreck movie, which is certainly a dubious gimmick in narrative. Almost all shipwreck stories suck, because it's such an obvious impetus for a writer to go native and force personal beliefs into fictional reality. Lord of the Flies is the most popular example of this, and what an unwatchable (or unreadable, as the case may be) story that turns out to be. It relies on ""allegory"", which is a French word meaning ""angry man rants for audience of whoever will listen to him"". Not good art.

This story, however, takes the shipwreck story into the far more interesting and beautiful direction of stripping away socialization from its characters and allowing them to develop (both narratively and biologically) in a spirit of pure individuation. It concerns itself with how human beings behave instinctively, and hinges these concerns on observable reality (which is the only basis that counts with this sort of thing).

It's sexual in ways only French films are supposed to be able to get away with, chauvinistic in ways only Italian films are supposed to be able to get away with, and amoral in ways only indie films are supposed to be able to get away with. Why is this not already considered a landmark art film?

The cinematography? It's Nestor Almendros' finest work, and that's saying A LOT. The music? Good. The acting? Believe it or not, serviceable. The ending? There's room for interpretation, but if you subscribe to the interpretation of it that I hold, it's one of the most beautiful and poignant endings in all of cinema.

In short, if you've happened upon this review in ignorance of the film in question, scroll up the page and buy this movie. Unless you're looking for a film that realistically depicts the nature of being on a deserted island (which this film unapologetically overlooks in its pursuit of making a film that realistically depicts the nature of being a human being), you're going to like The Blue Lagoon A LOT.",1316649600,4,2180,4.849462365591398

***SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT AS I GO OVER THE STORY, SEE BOTTOM AFTER THE END SPOILERS MARK IF YOU WISH NOT TO SEE SPOILERS***

This movie chronicles the lives of Em and Richard, who in the beginning of the movie are on a ship en route from Boston to San Fransisco with Richard's father, who is also Em's uncle. The children are likely about 7 or 8 years old at this time. At some point after the ship comes around the southern tip of South America, a fire breaks out on board, and in the confusion the two end up in a lifeboat with the ship's cook, Paddy Button. They try to get as far away from the burning ship as possible because there is blasting powder on board, which they know will cause an explosion.

As the ship goes down, a fog rolls in, and the boat with Em, Richard, and Paddy are becomes separated from the other boats, including the one containing Richard's father, and they are carried away in the boat with the tides.

After a day or two stranded in the boat, they wake up in sight of a deserted island, and paddle to it. On the island, they find fresh flowing water, and a bounty of fruits. They have landed on a true paradise.

Over the course of the next year or so (it's not made clear exactly how long, could have been longer than a year, could have been less), Paddy teaches the kids all kinds of things about how to survive in their environment, how to catch and cook food, how to tie knots and use bamboo and other natural resources to build a safe shelter, teaches them that not everything is for eating (the ""never wake up"" berries), declares that the law is never to go to the other side of the island, where he stumbled across a sacrificial altar and knew it had been recently used, teaches them how to keep track of the days, how to build and maintain fire, and all other kinds of things that an experienced seaman such as himself could pass on to them.

Unfortunately, however, Paddy goes out into the water one night, drunk (they found a barrel of rum on the island first day they were there), and the children find him the next morning dead (they don't fully know the meaning of dead, however) on a nearby island. Em requests that she and Richard get away from the home they had with Paddy. It was just too hard for them to be there without him. So they pack up what little they had and get in the rowboat, and settle on a beach just around from that and still on the same island.

The years go by, and Em and Richard have grown to the beginning of their teenage years. In that time, that have built themselves a magnificent home and have utilized everything they ever learned from Paddy to live well. They are in excellent physical condition, yet their minds are still that of children in many ways, having nobody but themselves after the death of Paddy.

As they grow, they argue a lot. They face hardships that temporarily split them up, and another that brings them closer together than ever before. They develop a true, real, strong, natural love for each other, though they don't know what's going on with that, along with other things they are going through as they enter puberty, as they have never had these things explained to them before. As they fall deeper in love than ever before and begin to explore it as well as themselves, they discover sex, and use it as a pure expression of their love for each other, true and natural.

Em becomes pregnant but again doesn't have a clue what's going on with her, nor does Richard. At one point he questions her love for him because she's no longer interested in sharing their love physically, but she tells him that it just hurts right now, and doesn't know why. But she assures Richard that she does really love him, more than ever, and they can do it again when she feels better. Then she tells Richard to feel her tummy, and he feels the baby kicking, though neither one of them knows what's going on.

So the night comes that Em finally gives birth, and don't know why or how this baby came, but they instantly fall in love with it. They become excellent parents to young Paddy (named after their old mentor, of course), and stay on the island for about another two years with him, a very happy family, full of love at it's purest.

One day Em requests Richard to take her back to where they lived with Paddy. She wants to see it again. So they get in the boat and row around to the other beach. It is pretty run down, their old hut is in ruins, and Richard found a small raft he once made for Paddy as a present in the bushes, beaten and battered. While looking around, they don't notice little Paddy putting some of the ""never wake up"" berries into the boat. Richard continues to have a look around, but Em gets into the boat with little Paddy, and they drift out a little into the water.

Em appears to be nodding off when Paddy throws one of the oars overboard. She wakes up and tries to grab it but can't, and calls Richard for help. He comes running, then swimming, towards them but as he is about to reach the lost oar, a shark shows up. Em throws the other oar at the shark to get it away from Richard as he pulls himself into the boat. They try to paddle back to the oars with their hands but the currents are just too strong, and they are stranded in the boat yet again, this time with little Paddy.

After a day or two, they wake up to find Paddy eating the ""never wake up"" berries and become horrified to find that he's swallowed some of them. Their loves shows itself strong, and Richard divides the remaining berries and both him and Em eat some. They kiss each other and huddle up as a family on the bottom of the boat.

After a few hours or possibly a day, a boat shows up with Richard's father on board, who after all this time still believes them to be alive, still looking for them wherever they may be. When he finally finds them, he learns that they are not dead, but merely sleeping. Then roll end credits.

The ending, in which ever way it can possibly be interpreted, is, at least to me, so sad in every way. However, I like to think of them being too close to death to save them and that they did die shortly after. As sad as this ending also it, it is much happier to me than the alternative, that they are ""rescued"" by Richard's father and taken back to society, where there's no way they'll have a place to fit in, and never again see their one true home, their island. I just wanted them to be able to stay there happily forever on that island, undisturbed by anything or anyone else, and was so sad when they got lost at sea in that boat away from their island. The only downside in any possible outcome would have been, what would there have been for little Paddy when he got older? Nobody for him to fall in love with, etc. But still, the ending I envision, with them dying shortly after being found, while still so sad, is probably in the same time the happiest ending (unless they had lived in their paradise for an extra few years and enjoying it a bit more before dying).

***END SPOILERS AND STORY REVIEW***

So all in all, this is in one go the most beautiful, as well as a sad, story of two children who grow together and fall in love in paradise. Not that I dislike my current life, but if I were given a choice, perhaps in a next life, to choose my own destiny, it would be the one the main characters in this movie had, without a doubt. To grow up away from society and all of it's negativism, to live a life so pure and beautiful and undisturbed by anything or anyone, with the greatest, strongest, most natural, purest love that can be found anywhere in an absolute paradise setting. Ah, to dream!

Also, don't let the nudity discourage you. This is a fantastic movie. Only the prudes really look down on the nudity in this movie. From beginning to end, many emotions go through you along with the characters, excellently complimented by a gorgeous soundtrack. I highly recommend ""The Blue Lagoon"" to everyone, especially to those who like to dream. WARNING, however, it can be depressing to watch too, just because you wish so much that it could have been your life.

One more thing, to those who say the acting is bad, I think it's fine. Keep in mind that they are supposed to be playing young teens with the minds of 8 year old children, because that's about how old they were when they first landed on that island. So they still played and talked a lot like children, while also eventually growing up and maturing in their own way. I think it was excellent. This is by far my new favorite movie. A thousand and one stars, if I could give it so many! Enjoy!",1284854400,8,8906,4.280451574569222

648712,4,6303451489,"I found this film most poignant.  These poor children are all alone.  They have no tribe, no collected wisdom, no relatives to help them.  Plus they have been cruelly misled in their childhood.  The setting is paradisial but the film does not gloss over the bewilderment the two kids feel.  They are so ignorant, more ignorant than any native could be, and yet also ""pre-programmed"" with plenty of lies about sexuality and life.  They are ""clueless,"" helpless and pitiably vulnerable, in short, so alone.  Loneliness is not a normal human condition. The two kids don't know what is happening to their bodies or to their feelings and intellects and both Shields and Atkins skilfully represent in acting their characters' troubles.  I think that people are wrong to censure Shields's acting.  The two kids bicker, not knowing why, and then feel sad.  I could not help comparing the scenes of conflict here to the fictionalized sexual scenes in Robin Baker's *Sperm Wars,* which are less notable for sexual stuff as for the pathos of how men and women get along, or don't.  This film is ""soft porn,"" true.  I don't speak moralizingly---I enjoy decent porn---and as soft porn, this film is as soft as a kitten by 2009 standards, and all in good taste. Skinny-dipping.  That's as innocent as apple pie.  But the characters' bewilderment, and Fate, combine to bring the film to a tragic ending which affected me.

648715,5,6303451489,"The lush beauty and splendor of a South Pacific paradise is vividly captured in this version of Henry DeVere Stacpoole's 1903 novel. Two small children and a ship's cook survive a shipwreck and find safety on an idyllic tropical island. Soon, however, the cook dies and the young boy and girl are left on their own.

Days become years and Emmeline (Brooke Shields) and Richard (Christopher Atkins) make a home for themselves surrounded by exotic creatures and nature's beauty. They learn to cope with the bewildering variety of physical changes that come with adolescence and as they begin to mature, their childhood affections lead to a sensitive and more profound love and the birth of a child as the years pass as Richard & Emmeline both grow into tall, strong, and beautiful teenagers blossoming into Manhood & Womanhood while surviving on a remote paradise living in a hut & spend their days together skinny-dipping, fishing, swimming, and diving for pearls and begin to fall in love with each other, but is emotionally stressful for them, due to their lack of education on human sexuality & intimacy are able to express their physical attraction for one another.

The truth of the matter is this flick was shot in Jamaica & on a privately-owned island in Fiji called Nanuya Levu, whilst the blue lagoon scenes were filmed in Champagne Bay, Vanuatu and this DVD bonus feature, Brooke Shields states that a lot of her nude scenes were done by older body-doubles, especially since Brooke was only 14 years old when she did this movie, but Brooke also explains to us that she did plenty of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her ta-tas.

This drama flick that was theatrically released in the Summer of 1980 also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I saw THE BLUE LAGOON on HBO for the very first time back in November of 1981 which was a year later from its theatrical release along with the fact that I was living in the Imperial Valley and was 8 years old in the 2nd grade at Rockwood Elementary School in Calexico, CA and living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time.",1226275200,5,2096,4.65945945945946
648806,1,6303451489,"This film was such taboo when it was released, and it still is today when you think about it.  I remember when I was younger my parents flipped when they caught me watching this on cable television, like it was an adult film or something.  What is titillating as a young kid is borderline ridiculous (or really just plain ridiculous) as an adult.  Honestly, I can't for the life of me understand why anyone wanted to make this movie.

The film is a remake of a 1949 British film (I have not seen it but I just might since it is labeled as `classier' and this trash could have used some class) and it follows two cousins (kissing cousins) as they are left destitute on an island after the ship they are on explodes.  They are washed ashore with a crewman named Paddy who soon winds up drunk and in the water.  In other words; he dies.  This leaves the two youngsters, Emmeline and Richard, to fend for themselves, and they do this for years.  The movie follows them growing older and as they age they start to notice one another and soon the film becomes nothing more than a perverse look at two kids falling in love.

The film is not helped by the two young actor's lack of talent.  I won't say that Shields hasn't developed some acting skill but here neither actor can make the material palatable.  Each of them can't seem to get a handle on their characters and maybe this is due to the fact that the script paints them as helplessly ignorant and ridiculously childish.

Sure, they have been separated from the world since they were young (not `that' young though), but are we really expected to believe that they don't know what a skull is or that they have never seen a pregnant woman before?

The film comes off rather tasteless as apposed to being a character study.  In a way this reminds me of `Showgirls', which was another one of those films that the director rallied behind trying to make it seem as if it was much more than simple trash.  This is not a smart movie, nor is it an effective film.  Director Richard Kleiser and writer Douglas Day Stewart should have intentionally strayed away from the obvious in order to build an air of longing the viewer.  If they had focused on the mental state of these two characters instead of their physical appearance then maybe this film would have morphed into something interesting and intelligent.

The end of the film (which in itself is also a stretch) is tender in its own right and actually touched me a little, but to be honest it was not enough to warrant any respect.  As we watch these two characters make their way through life we don't feel as much for them as we do for the poor actors who portray them, for no actor should have to list this film of their rsum.",1221523200,7,2728,4.398406374501992
648807,4,6303451489,"The Blue Lagoon  DVD

In 1980, when this film was released, there was quite a bit of controversy, most of it ill-founded. There were complaints about incest, but the two children are not brother and sister: Emmeline clearly addresses Arthur Lestrange as Uncle, while Richard calls him Father, so the closest they could be is cousins, and the use of Uncle may have been conventional (indicating guardianship) rather than literal. There were complaints about showing a 14-year-old actress nude, but they used body doubles for all of the nude scenes (Brooke Shields spends some of the commentary pointing which body double was used for which scene).

The plot is fairly straightforward. A man, Arthur Lestrange (William Daniels), is taking two children, Emmeline (Elva Josephson) and Richard (Glenn Kohan), from Boston to San Francisco by sailing ship around the turn of the century (the date is not specified). Because the Panama Canal doesn't exist yet, they must travel right down to the bottom of South America to get around. After rounding the bottom, there's a fire aboard - something that is a serious concern, but in this case it is worse, because it is in a hold containing blasting powder, so the passengers are rowed away from the ship. In the confusion, the children are separated from Arthur Lestrange; they end up in a boat with Paddy, the ship's cook (Leo McKern). To make things worse, a heavy fog rolls in, the ship blows up, and they are adrift by themselves.

Luck (and the scriptwriter) is with them, and they awaken within sight of an island. They are very fortunate to discover that this island has fresh water, ample fruit (bananas, papayas, and coconuts, amongst others), and is generally a tropical paradise. Paddy shows them various useful skills, including the construction of a hut, and collection of food, before dying. Now two fairly young children (I'm guessing they are under ten years) are alone. Years pass, and Richard (now Christopher Atkins) and Emmeline (now Brooke Shields) are coping fairly well with the basics of feeding themselves, but they are going through a variety of traumas as their bodies change. Matters like Emmeline's first period are not glossed over - it's easy to see how terrifying that could be for a young girl with no idea of what is happening to her. Emotionally, the pair are still children, and they squabble and tease one another just as children do. There are a series of events (nope, I'm not saying what) that split them apart, then bring them back together. Yes, they do learn about sex, and that is also handled sensitively - it could have come across as pornographic, but it doesn't, it comes across as tender and caring. The consequences are handled well, too. Bear in mind that these children, back on the ship, were still at the ""cabbage patch"" stage of sex education...

Providing you have a broad enough mind not to be scandalized by the nudity (which is utterly appropriate to the setting), this is a sweet love story set in a tropical paradise, a study of innocence, with enough drama to add seasoning.

Recommended For fans OF Brooke Shields(of Calvin Klein blue jeans fame) and love stories.

What about Chris?  That's why I originally saw this movie and enjoyed watching. Very few films show male frontal nudity and it got more sterile as the years have gone on. Treated as complete taboo.
Maybe I'm alone in this?

648811,5,6303451489,"One of my cheesy favorites. This is a great movie to rent with your girlfriend/boyfriend on a rainy day. Nice little story, cute and funny subject matter, and pretty faces as stars. Brooke is absolutely gorgeous in this film. She actually gives a good performance as a stranded teen on an island growing up with her childhood friend. The story focuses on their maturing emotionally and physically, and eventually their love for each other. Definitely a must see. Classic 80's!",1187827200,,476,4.9625
648812,3,6303451489,"I was only 5 when this movie came out, and had no idea of the controversy it created until seeing it as an adult.  The controversy it created was enough to generate box office returns and made this into one of the most well known modern classics.  And yet, for me, it left many things to be desired.

Brooke Sheilds and Christopher Atkins play Richard and Em, two kids who are the only survivors of a ship wreck on a desert island.  They are rescued by the ship's cook, a man named Patty, who manages to provide them with just enough survival skills (food, shelter, etc.), not to mention social and language skills to survive once he dies suddenly.  Being isolated and knowing nothing of the outside world, they will, naturally, go through puberty and somehow fall in love without really know what's going on.  They also have a baby, completely neive what to do with it and how to care for it, but, somehow, as primative people do, survive.

There is much implied that isn't said in this movie.  Richard and Em just might be cousins.  They are practically naked throughout the entire movie, and made a million people cry ""kiddie porn"" (although he did use a body double for some of the more reveiling scenes showing Brooke's 14 year old breasts).  The special features are good, where Brooke and Chris recall each and every scene with all the amusing anecdotes that an experience like this would entail.  How embarrassing for Atkins to say that he was so short next to Shields that he had to wear lifts in scenes where they were walking side by side.  It was mostly about the lush setting, making Fiji probably the most romantic honeymoon spot for years to come.  It's hard to argue with a beautiful island place like Fiji.

Still, this is a movie about happiness, innocence, and getting back to nature.  That's what we all want, living in paradise and free of the evils of the world.  Enjoy it for all its innocent passions it envokes.",1185235200,4,1936,4.5520231213872835
648813,4,6303451489,"Blue Lagoon is not a blue (raunchy, erotic, etc.) movie at all. It is an interesting examination of the scenario it presents. I have never understood why the critics all rate it so poorly. And I don't even understand why almost everyone scorns the dialogue, and the acting. It all seemed reasonable and realistic enough to me, given the ages of the protagonists (not the actors). What's the matter with the carpers? This is a fine and beautiful movie, much better than lots that are rated higher.",1176940800,10,496,4.712643678160919

648815,3,6303451489,"**Possible spoilers**  In this infamous movie, Richard and Emmeline land as children on a remote island with the gruff but loveable Paddy. Not long after Paddy shows them the basics of survival, Paddy dies and the two youngsters are left all alone and forced to fend for themselves. Nature takes its course and it isn't long before the teenaged Emmeline becomes pregnant. What are the fates if these three? It would be all too easy to conclude this is a tale of morality, funded by a religious conservative group and filmed to warn kids and their parents about the dangers of sex before marriage, the price of ignorance and the importance of parental involvement in a child's life. A pregnant teen with no job, no health insurance and an unemployed husband, forced to live off the charity of others. Get thee to a nunnery. Yet I am going to go against the grain on this one and say that I don't think that was the purpose behind this film. If the goal was to serve as a warning, then why is there a happy ending even though there is no repentance? Certainly they must be made to pay for their sins?! This blatant effrontery and refutation of providence very obviously signifies an exercise of free will and desire for base pleasures. These children experience puberty in a very innocent and natural manner, without all the social stigmas and peer pressures that normally accompany this period of life. In this way, the film resembles a documentation of human development and a social study. Plot aside, the acting is not especially good, though it would be difficult for most of us to deliver some of these lines with a straight face. Not a bad film, just not all that great either.",1158278400,11,1682,4.625418060200669
648900,2,6303451489,"Blue Lagoon was a commercial success but due to the terrible acting and the cheesy storyline, the movie did very bad with the critics.

I personally loved the beautiful scenery - the ocean and the islands - it really does make the movie worth seeing.  And Brooke Shields was just about the most gorgeous girl to look at when she made this movie - this is why the movie was a commercial success.  Though Brooke's acting was just terrible, she was so beautiful to look at that no one cared.  Now Brooke is trying so hard to become a serious actress.  She tries and tries and tries... however though she has improved somewhat, she just is not a good actress.  I just watched Bob the Butler and throughout the movie her efforts to try so hard to act well made it that I just couldn't see her character.  Brooke Shields trying so hard to act was all that anyone could see.  However this doesn't for a second take away from her great beauty and sweet nature.  She is a very nice person and a very lovely woman.

So if you haven't seen Blue Lagoon, see it if you just want to get lost in the beauty of nature and Brooke Shields.  Otherwise you'll just laugh at this movie.",1154822400,4,1165,4.298165137614679
648901,4,6303451489,"When Blue Lagoon came out in the theatres, I was 17, and my parents refused to allow me to see it. It wasn't until I was 29, married and had cable that I finally watched this contraversial film.  While I still think it more appropriate for the actors to have been 18 years old, rather than 14, due to the mature themes and nudity, this is not your hot and sweaty sex movie.  You can get that from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and just about any daytime/primetime TV, these days.  What the story is about is 2 cousins, eventually left on their own, trying to survive in an Eden-like paradise, with the innocence of children and the natural curiosities that adolescence brings on.  They love, gently and affectionately, they have a child, they are content.  When a ship nears, they make a mutual decision to remain on the island and not try to be rescued. In a word, they are complete.  While the acting overall was pretty pathetic, and the script trite in many places, there were some poignant moments; Em ""meeting"" God and laying flowers at his feet so they would not make Him mad and would go to Heaven.  Richard contemplating the bleached skeleton of Paddy and realizing his own eventual fate, as well as that of Em and his son. The mutual decisions not to be saved, as well as saying farewell to each other after eating poison berries, when accidently drifting out to sea. One cannot but be heartbroken when they are found asleep, rather than dead, because there will be no place in society for them.  They belong in paradise, and the director should have let them die. Even the music becomes sad rather than jubilant. Scenery gorgeous, a beautiful score, acting fairly bad.  So, why do we keep returning to Blue Lagoon?  Because wouldn't we all like to be marooned on a gorgeous tropical island with our perfect love and be left to live simple and fulfilling lives in paradise? 5 stars for the idea, 2-3 for acting, so gave it a 4.",1149811200,17,1931,4.507163323782235
648902,2,6303451489,"The action and dialog of this film are easily one of the worst ones I ever have seen. The plot is highly improbable, the form how the lifes of these two kids develop impossible. The behavior of the two defies all logic and is a bad transplant from what somebody who seemingly never lived through adolescence nor ever read a book about it believes to be adolescent behavior to an idyllic south sea island. The admittedly very good photography cannot save the moment nor let the viewer forget the stupidity of the movie itself. This is compounded by the total acting incompetence of Brooke Shields - and she isn't even good-looking enough to forgive her for her ineptitude.",1140998400,4,671,4.694915254237288

648904,3,6303451489,"The Blue Lagoon is pure fantasy from start to finish.

When the ship that they are traveling home on, it catches on fire.  Two lifeboats are launched.  On one are a boy, a girl and the ship's cook (Leo McKern).  The other contains the other adults.  The lifeboats are separated.  The children's boat drifts and finally lands on an island.

The cook does his best to bring up the children and teach them to survive.  Eventually, he dies and the children are left alone.  They eventually grow up and become Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins.

This film is one long morality play.  What if everyone was innocent?  What would happen?  Is procreation learned or natural?

This film is more beautiful than great.  Nestor Almendros' cinematography is just stunning.  It is one of those films that is better to look at than listen to.

648905,5,6303451489,"i saw this movie for the first time when i was 14 back in 1988

and i have loved it ever sense. it's about a boy named richard

(christopher atkins)and a girl named emmeline(brooke shields)who

are sailing to san francisco with richard's father but then the

ship catches fire and every one has to escape, the kids escape

with a man named paddy. they come to an island where they live

with paddy until he dies and they have to live there alone and they wait for the day when they are rescued, they grow up together on this island and as they grow and change they begin to have feelings for each other that they don't understand(like

every teenager does) and they learn about love and sex and then

emmeline gets pregnant and then they have to learn about parent-

hood. it's a wonderful love story for young adults to watch (but

not for any one younger than 14.)

some people thought that this movie was pornography and maybe for that time it was for some people but it's actually a beauti-

ful story about growing up and falling in love. the people who

thought it was pornography only saw that it was a 14 year old girl running around an island naked but what they didn't know was that most of the time it wasn't brooke it was an 30 year old

body double. this movie is a wonderful movie, i learned so much

from this movie when i was 14, i learned about love and yes i

learned about sex but watching this movie did not make me want to run out and have sex it made me want to fall in love. i had

such a crush on christopher atkins after seeing him in this movie, i thought he was such a hotty ( i still do) and brooke was ok too.

i think every one would love this movie but of course they would

have to see beyond the nakedness and look at the story to really

love it.",1126656000,10,1780,4.119186046511628

Subsequently,Kleiser directed HONEY,I BLEW UP THE KID which was a sequel to HONEY,I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The 1991 sequel to this film,RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, was a box office disappointment. In the summer of 1980 when this film was theatrically released,other hit movies from then include URBAN COWBOY and THE BLUES BROTHERS.

648908,5,6303451489,"I'm no longer a kid these days.. But(...)I actually watched The Blue Lagoon almost every day for about a year or more. It was that good. For a person who loves nature, who dream of being free from the horrors and oppressions of modern civilization, this film can be an inspiration and an oasis; a positive influence of lustfulness, beauty and innocense that we so rarely find on concrete sidewalks. As a kid, i was also inspired to ride my bike to the sea as often as i could,  wading into the water and swimming for hours at a time.
 Did this FILM really do this to me? Well, I believe that these actions were already in my interest and in our human nature. The joy of being close to nature, feeling your feet touching the bare ground.. Eating fragrant fruits, enjoying your own body, for a few moments seeing the world through the turquoise haze of sea water. I must say that this is a very HEALTHY inspiration, and it never ceased to influence me.

Brooke Shields is so fantastically beautiful.

These two young main characters..  live out what most young people would want from life, without the constant and unjust accusations from their parents, teachers ...

They are naked at times, like anyone would be in an island like this (footage took place on Turtle Island, Fiji),in a natural and beautiful way. And their love is sweet..

They wear beautiful clothes and the whole scenery is as beautiful as Brooke. :)

However, it is quite obvious that the author of this story has not lived a life away from civilization himself; a few occurances seem unlikely to happen among people who have lived half their life in a paradise.

Does this affect the beauty of this story? No, it does not.

Love this film.",1122940800,4,1708,4.552287581699346

649010,4,6303451489,"In 1980, when this film was released, there was quite a bit of controversy, most of it ill-founded. There were complaints about incest, but the two children are not brother and sister: Emmeline clearly addresses Arthur Lestrange as Uncle, while Richard calls him Father, so the closest they could be is cousins, and the use of Uncle may have been conventional (indicating guardianship) rather than literal. There were complaints about showing a 14-year-old actress nude, but they used body doubles for all of the nude scenes (Brooke Shields spends some of the commentary pointing which body double was used for which scene).

 I'd guess that opinion about this film polarises into about three camps. There are those who are shocked / scandalised (let's hope they don't buy the DVD and be shocked and scandalised all over again). There are those who are titillated by the nudity (such a shock for them to learn that they are looking at a 30-year-old woman, rather than a 14-year-old!). And then there are those who can see past all that to the sweet, innocent love story that the film is really all about.

  The plot is fairly straightforward. A man, Arthur Lestrange (William Daniels), is taking two children, Emmeline (Elva Josephson) and Richard (Glenn Kohan), from Boston to San Francisco by sailing ship around the turn of the century (the date is not specified).

  But there is some great extras too..There are 2 different commentaries that you can listen to while viewing the film..1 is with Christopher and the other one is with Brooke..Wish they would have had them together instead of separate..Both comm are very fun to listen to..And the memories they share are priceless as well..They try to make you feel like you were there with them..Listen to both mostly the Brooke one *which of course is my fav*..
  I wish they would rerelease this in the theater coz to see it again on the big silver screen would be the ultimate..1980 was a year of 2 movies like that ""Windwalker"" and this movie..Filmwork at its finest..Get this dvd and relive the Magic..If you never seen it get it and be introduced to a 1980s movie that set the decade..And meet Brooke at Midnight In The Oasis..I Know I WiLL..",1078617600,8,3224,4.60801393728223

  The two actors playing their characters of ""Em""and ""Richard""as two overgrown children. Who play and they are unable to understand
the changes in the world around them
  Ms. Shields'character is also having trouble accepting Mr.
Atkins amour for her. And Mr. Atkins wants only to leave the
island and return home to San Fransico,Ca.
  When Ms. Shields almost dies from a bite from a rockfish.
 Mr. Atkins takes her to a alter,used by some canibals for
their evil rituals and pleads with the lord to save his cousin.
 Ms. Shields recovers from the bite and it isn't long.
Before the pair are swimming nude and making out in a quiet,
little cove with unrequited joy.
  There is no real plot here and the acting is none exsistent.
The main attraction of ""Blue Lagoon"" is Mr. Kleiser's filming of
the lush,tropical surroundings of Fiji and the rapport between
Ms. Shields and Mr. Atkins.
  Hence.
  ""The Blue Lagoon""is good..if you want to see Ms. Shields'
character making love to Mr. Atkins'""Richard"" and seeing
these two take a skinny dip either into a tropical pool
or into the waters of The South Seas?
  But..if you're looking for a meaningful story?
  Believe me..you woint find it here.
  (This film also features camo appearances by William Daniels
and The Late Leo McKern..Despite what one reviewer of this VHS
Print of ""Blue Lagoon""has stated. Mr. McKern's character of""Paddy
Button""was not the grandfather of the two kids..(Who were not
played by Ms. Shields and Mr. Atkins..they were played by two other actors).Mr. McKen played a gruff but kindhearted galley
who was also stranded with the kids).",1067126400,4,1841,4.870967741935484
649131,5,6303451489,A very nice enjoyable movie with young Brooke Shields when she very first started acting besides Endless Love this is a good film it is about a young woman and a young man getting stranded on an island and having to stay there for a couple of years and they learn to stick it out and they learn how to survive and adapt on the island this is good film I would reccommend anyone who likes Brooke Shields to buy this video I am not a big fan of hers but this is a great movie and I really did enjoy it!!!!,1067126400,4,503,3.9411764705882355
649132,5,6303451489,"When my wife and I first saw The Blue Lagoon we both agreed that it was a fascinating movie of two young children stranded on a deserted island with no one to help them survive, but themselves after their grandfather died. As they grew they learned to love and respect each other, to work together to survive. One of their greatest pleasures was swimming, and because they didn't have the luxury of having bathing suites they swim nude. As they matured towards adulthood they discovered that their bodies were changing and eventualy innocently discovered what sex is between a male and a female. The most moving part to us was that they didn't understand she was pregnant but successfully gave birth to a healthy son that they both deeply loved. Instead of being based on sex, as some say it is, the story is really based on having to learn to survive, on love and respect for each other.",1062892800,7,888,4.591194968553459
649133,5,6303451489,"The Blue Lagoon is a true classic, never have I seen a film shot as beautifully as this one. It is a true story about natual love, the discovery of one's self, their bodies, their confusing feelings for one another as they hit man and womanhood. This film deals with a lot of issues- growing up on their own on a deserted island, their sexuality, masterbation, menstration, sex,parenthood. This film is wonderful. Never have I really seen a film that's not set in civillisation but is so entertaining for one but the story is just beautiful, and Brooke Shields as Emmeline and Christopher Atkins as Richard are fantastic. The musical score is truely beautiful and makes me feel a range of emotions. The first time I saw this film I was so fasinated by it, and was about the same age as the characters so I could relate to some of the emotions they were going through, the confusion of everything. Anyone thinking about buying this film-Go for it- You woun't regret it. As for the fans who have loved this film throught out the years, it was worth the wait. The Extras on the DVD are excellent. The two commentaries are very informative and I love listening to the Brooke Shields track and hearing her insight about the film and that time the film came out. It's also interesting looking at her own personal photo album and the featurette from 1980 is very interesting. This film will always be one of my favourites.-Brooke Shields is just beautiful and is one of the best actress' of her generation.",1045958400,28,1499,4.597014925373134
649134,5,6303451489,"There couldn't be a more beautiful movie than this one. It completely shows the way of human nature. When discussing philosophy and how some things work in this world, I refer to this movie so much. What is so true about the movie is that everything that happens in it is natural, innocent, and pure. Some might disagree with the content of the movie, well if someone can't handle nudity, they shouldn't be watching it.(that includes children) If you feel that it is appropriate for a child then let them see it. I first saw this movie at the age of 12 and thought it was a touching story. Some people might say that it's a dirty movie with it's sex scenes, but the beauty of the movie is that it was a natural experience where they weren't having sex to ""do it"", but because they loved each other, and that's more beautiful than anything.",1044576000,14,839,4.419354838709677

about 2 children that get shipwrecked near an island. Time goes by
and they jump ahead 10 or 12 years when they are arond 20.(by the way the children made the island there home)The two are always fighting but soon they fall in love without knowing it. They have a baby and stay on the island for about 2 years with the baby.

649138,4,6303451489,"This film has been hailed as a classic story of first love. Others view it as an example of mainstream child pornography. I prefer to air on the side of it being a classic. The film is the story of two young children who are shipwrecked together. It isn't long before they discover what makes boys different from girls and begin experimenting with sex. Eventually they concieve and Brooke's character bears a child. They face all sorts of hardships before the surprising ending (I won't spoil it). It's a fact that Brooke is dresssed rather scantily throiughout most of the film and she and her beau have several nude scenes (mostly underwater). Unlike today when they use 18-19 year old actors to play teens, Brooke was about 15 when this was filmed. Some like it, others don't.

Right now, I'm can watch this moving again and again, as it leaves the innocence feeling after the titles go off. Acting is good, so is the set up, so is the camera shots. I think this movie should be bought just because.
I think it is great and i guess, it reminds me of being 12 every time I watch it.",980553600,3,466,3.9157894736842107

A refreshing movie with very little violence. And the sex in it is done very beautifully and is fine for preteens/teens to view.",971049600,4,389,4.492957746478873

Really, I was just in love with Christopher Atkins!  I remember a  lot of it going over my head.  I would ask questions about what on earth  was going on but no one was going to tell me just yet.  It was fun to watch  it later on when I knew the facts of life!
Brooke Shields was so  beautiful - what happened to her? (catty, I know) Christopher is as cheeky  and boyish as ever.  I can't believe this is available on DVD!

7847211,5,6303451489,"The Blue Lagoon was never meant to be a deep, intellectual film full of implied allegorical might or with a complex plot. It is about what many young people fantasize about in their own lives; at least back when it came out. I was a teenager when this came out and we always used to argue about with whom we would like to get stuck on a deserted tropical island and for the most part, this had been brought to the big screen for all of us. For some, including myself, the sight of Brooke Shields running around in her skimpy attire stoked the fire of teen yearnings and my wife says the same of Christoper Atkins. Brooke was the one of the most beautiful girls we had ever seen at our age and the movie really tickled our funny-bone.

The acting is childish and novice to some, but remember that they were marooned on the island as small children and essentially were stuck in a state of arrested adolescence. The scenery is lush and tropical and the handmade home on the beach was the thing of young dreams. Reward yourself with this silly, but sentimental film about the carefree days of youth.

The world of The Blue Lagoon--the world of two children who become a young woman and man depending upon each other--is real.  The simple survival nature of the marine life and the seemingly flippant weather wonderfully support the couple's experience through loss and laughter, frustration and kindness.  This is innocence, not naivete, and oddly, in a remarkably satisfying way, I experienced as much of living while watching this film about innocence, as I've experienced through any other piece of art.",1523664000,,558,5.390804597701149

7847219,4,6303451489,"Bear with me, but I've always felt this movie was a bit underrated. It's been panned for the wooden acting of Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins, but they're SUPPOSED to be teenagers stuck in the minds of the children they were when they washed up on the island. If you take away their childish voices and dialogue, there are actually quite a few nice acting moments here. Yes, there's always been a few scenes that made zero sense - such as Brooke (Emmaline) not instinctively knowing that her baby would suckle on her breasts. What did she think that milk was for? And I certainly never bought that they would wait until they hit puberty before having sexual encounters - most children ""play doctor"" starting pretty young. But if you can overlook some of that, it's a charming movie with gorgeous scenery. Some will gripe about the teenage sex, but its done tastefully - almost too tastefully. What teenage girl looks so happy and fulfilled after her first sexual encounter?

Worth a look alone for the beautiful scenes of the island (Fiji), the animals, and the glossy magazine-cover bodies of the two young leads. Has there ever been a more stunning teen than Brooke Shields? Doubtful this movie would get made today as the country seems to have moved back to the Victorian era in regards to sexuality.",1522540800,7,1309,4.741228070175438
