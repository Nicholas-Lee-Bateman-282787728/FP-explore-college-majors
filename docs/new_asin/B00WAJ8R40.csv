7127537,5,B00WAJ8R40,how can you beat this collection?,1454630400,,33,4.666666666666667
7127538,5,B00WAJ8R40,"Fantastic value! This 3 movie set is exactly what I was looking for. I was interested in purchasing just one of the movies that are included and then I saw this ""set"" for the exact same price as ONE of the movies! It comes in two discs (Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day on Disc 1 and Stripes of Disc 2) if that matters to anyone. Excellent purchase for the movie collector!",1442793600,4,371,4.314285714285714
7127550,1,B00WAJ8R40,I bought this collection primarily for Groundhog Day. Yet when I tried to play it (on multiple DVRs) Ghostbusters is the ONLY movie that will play :-( Is it a defective disc or is there some magic menu item I'm missing?,1519344000,,219,4.365853658536586

7127553,5,B00WAJ8R40,Love all three of these films. We will watch Groundhog Day in the midst of summer just because it is so fun. One of our favorite Bill Murray movies. We purchased this simply for Groundhog Day but how can you pass up Stripes and Ghost Busters too. Great deal. Awesome comedies.,1518220800,,276,4.431372549019608

7127604,4,B00WAJ8R40,"Please note; my review reflects the DVDs themselves and NOT the films. All three movies are great. What you get is 2 discs. Disc 1 is a Dual-Layer DVD with Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day. Movies only, no extras. Each one in a little over 4 gbs; the standard single-layer format. Disc 2 is a Dual-Layer with the Extended Version of Stripes and all its original extra material.  Not bad, especially for the price. The only thing that would have made it better would have been: 3 Dual-Layer discs with proper transfers and extras for all 3 movies.  But if you are that picky...get the BluRay discs (right?). A nice set of Bill Murray classics!",1469232000,7,640,4.605263157894737

8712649,5,B00WAJ8R40,"Three all-time favorites all on 1 DVD. Yes, they show signs of the genre in which they were made but - who cares!!! I would recommend these if you are looking for some laugh out loud yucks for something that you don't really have to pay close attention to.

Original Ghostbusters is awesome and Groundhog Day is an all-time favorite! I haven't seen Stripes in many, many years but it has it's moments too!",1532390400,,405,4.472972972972973
