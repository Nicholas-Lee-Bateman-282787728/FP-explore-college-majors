An unidentified man introduces Jim Peron. He speaks for 20 minutes about how Ayn Rand affected his life, and why he went to her funeral.  The original introducer asks if anyone else wishes to speak, and a few people from the audience come up with no introductions and tell of how Ayn Rand changed their lives.
