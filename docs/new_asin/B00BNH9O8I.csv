5658987,5,B00BNH9O8I,"I like it when a director makes some spiritual truisms come to life in artistic, visual settings. At the very least, the script-writers and story-writers spent some time to do a small PART of their homework! I applaud 97% of the points raised in this wonderful movie of motherly love from beyond the grave!

First of all, here's 1 scene I did NOT like about this movie: some people in the writing team obviously have an anti-Catholic bias. If they had spent their time reading up on their own Protestant American history (America was never colonised by Catholics but by genocidal Prots who massacred the native American Indians - who, in turn, returned the favour by cursing them!), they would know for a fact that Prots used the violence of state to rip native American Indian children from their parents and forced to live miserably in Protestant boarding ""schools"" which were no better than Communist re-education slave labour camps. WHY does this movie show a Catholic nun being murdered and have men dressed as priests, along with a sheriff, chase an innocent mother through the woods and force her to take her own life? The writers and director could have easily used a SECULAR STATE orphanage in this movie, but no, they just couldn't resist dressing those actors and actresses up as ""Catholics""! IF not for scenes of those pretended Catholic characters, I would have given this movie 5/5 stars!

IF the writers of this movie had the common sense to even pick up a Catholic book and the read the history of exorcisms in the Catholic Church, then common sense would tell you that NO real, Catholic clergy would EVER allow such a tragic death of a mother to be conveniently ignored as this movie suggests! The violent hauntings as seen in this movie would NEVER happen IF the dead mother was laid to rest according to Roman Rites! But, of course, who can read the mind of anti-Catholic movie writers? FYI, blame the Prots for today's hauntings in the country. The lead actress' exclamation sums up the broken Prot society of today's America: ""Thank god (sic) I'm NOT pregnant!"" Take a look at scene 1 of this movie on the breakup of the family and the murders - all very Protestant traits from an atheistic Prot American society - lovers of guns, violence and family breakups!

OK.... Now's here's what I like about this movie:

(1)

The ""grounding"" technique used by Annabel the surrogate mother with her youngest adopted child is 100% right. This brief scene reflects reality. The technique will ground and still a Sensitive person who has an over-exposure to the spirit world. When performed by someone who radiates love and care, the technique works in bringing the afflicted person's spirit back into her own natural earthly body.

(2)

Yes, the Mama character does exists in reality! But, they're very rare on this earth. Don't go finding them out of curiosity. If you display aggression, you the human will be attacked. This is true.

(3)

Mama is NOT a malicious demon as some would rashly judge her to be. A demon from Hell CANNOT empathise or love a human, much less a human child, let alone raise a child in human chronological time.

Mama was / is a human spirit who, in reality, would come back with OTHER entities who in turn would probably do much more damage to living humans.

(4)

This is a tale of a mother's undying love for her child.

The last scene of this movie is most beautifully crafted! I love it!

The final fusion and transformation of the characters is totally beautiful and reflects a spiritual reality that cannot be usually expressed in ordinary human words! The writings of Catholic mystics could give you a glimpse of this fusion principle, and to experience it while retaining your own individuality and human Will is not easily describable in ordinary human language. The last scene in this movie reflects a spiritual reality and I absolutely love it! At least, the director got this one spiritual reflection correct!

The profoundly AWESOME ending that had sections of the cinema audience APPLAUD in grateful thanks! I always like a memorable ending to a movie!

This review will be edited further in due time.

Chastain's character was hard to warm up to but ....... well I don't want to spoil it for you.

5658989,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama (an excuse to critically discuss horror)

The horror genre has an unusual history in the cinematic world. Unlike traditional genres like comedy and drama, horror films seem aimed at a slightly more specialized market. And yet, with this specialized market, one would expect more diversity in the content, but history has revealed that this is not the case. Studios that release horror films seem to pray on popular cultural fads and then, most likely due to inexpensive production costs, let loose clone after clone after clone until these films eventually become less lucrative. Take a look at how many films follow this storyline: a mother notices some strange behavior in her child or around the house. She tells her husband, but her pleas fall on deaf ears; she must simply be imagining the pots and pans all stacking themselves all over the kitchen. Eventually, the husband witnesses something he can't explain and (hesitantly) agrees to contact an expert or specialist in strange behavior who is found on the Internet. Chaos ensues. The expert dies trying to help, one or more friends of the protagonist become victims, and it ends right where it started with a tiny difference that ties everything together. This form of formulaic market saturation as a business model may keep the genre alive, but it has also lessened its reputation. There's no doubt that horror films have the potential to affect an audience more than any other type of film since audience reaction is basically the watermark for success (consider those film trailers that do not show clips of the film, but rather show a packed, darkened theater of people wildly reacting to some outrageously scary moment).

Now, I am actually a horror fan and will concede that some of the greatest films are horror films (The Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, Frailty - look it up-, Jaws). However, the worst film of nearly every year is also a horror film (intentionally or unintentionally). Consequently, I am always wary of cinema that resists progress to idly make money off of spent franchises that are too cheap, production-wise, to give up. They make you want to cry for your...

Mama is the latest demented fable loosely attached to Guillermo del Toro, regardless of the relentless name dropping that advertisements display. Del Toro did produce, but his influence ends there, and thus, Mama is not Pan's Labyrinth. Mama begins with a catastrophic series of events that result in two young girls being abandoned in a strange cottage in the woods where they will live for five years before being discovered. Exposition sweeps us through a bizarrely simplified adoption process where the girls' uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is permitted to raise the girls in a state funded research house in order for the girls to be continuously observed by a psychologist. At this point, most of the stereotypical formula laid out previously proceeds.

Mama is written and directed by Andres Muschietti who bases it off of his own short film, also called Mama. Fundamentally, the story is not incredibly strong, and leaves the viewer with some noteworthy qualms, but Muschietti clearly understands where the few strengths of his story exist and manages to create a couple good scares. Additionally, he adds some fresh complexity to the film by writing Lucas's girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain), as a bass guitarist in a punk band who is apprehensive about having children and settling into a housewife role, but suddenly finds herself doing both. Muschietti also makes another honorable choice in that he tells a ghost story where the revelation of the ghost itself is not the object of the film. He, instead, introduces the ghost early and uses it as his chief form of tension building; that and the kids. The kids are creepy.

Mama is what it is. It raises no bars, but it holds a reasonably heavy one somewhat steadily in place. Expect the upcoming months to offer at least four more ""clones"" of this film as this fad works its way out. Then it should be smooth sailing... until it all starts over again in September.

5658990,3,B00BNH9O8I,"You might be wondering what acclaimed actress Jessica Chastain (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is doing in a goofy-named horror flick.  She's actually in good company with award winning stars like Nicole Kidman (""The Others"") and Naomi Watts (""The Ring"" 1 & 2) to name a couple.  Here Chastain plays Annabel, a Suzi Quatro-like bassist in a punk rock band, complete with short dark hair and tatted up arms.  She is the main squeeze of Lucas, a starving artist type played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, perhaps best known as the incestuous prince on ""Game of Thrones.""

The story begins with the twin brother of Lucas going on a killing rampage that includes fellow workers and his wife.  He takes his 2 young daughters out into the country with similar intent.  Before he can commit the deed a mysterious apparition intervenes.  Five years later Lucas is still trying to find out what happened to his brother and nieces.

Ultimately found, the girls have somehow managed to survive but are little more than wild animals.  Director Andres Muschietti manages to provide enough suspense to keep viewers on the edge on their seats using quick cuts and lighting.  At the same time, he also resorts to the usual ""gotcha"" moments complete with a jolting sound effect.

Annabel is the main focus in the story however as the girlfriend who reluctantly has to take over child care duties after Lucas is hospitalized thanks to an induced fall down a flight of stairs.  Chastain is excellent in the role and proves her dramatic range.  ""Mama"" is an above average horror film that relies on suspense rather than gore for chilling effects.  For me the ghostly presence's transformation to a CGI manifestation in the final act was unnecessary and changes the tone of the film somewhat.  Still this is a pretty scary ghost story and worth a look.",1358899200,45,1815,4.828478964401294
5658991,4,B00BNH9O8I,"""Mama"" (2013 release; 100 min.) introduces us to two girls, ages 3 and 1, who are kidnapped by their crazed dad (who has gone off the cliff due to the financial crisis). After an almost fatal car accident, the girls are abandoned by their dad in a remote cabin in the woods. Fast forward 5 years later: in a miracle, the girls, now 8 and 6, are found alive in the same cabin but they are almost savages now, in particular the youngest one. (Don't ask how they managed to survive on their own for 5 years...) The girls are given into the custody of their dad's brother and his girlfriend Anabelle (played by Chastain), while also still being treated by the psychologist. For Anabelle, a free spirit who plays bass guitar in a local rock band and is heavily tattoed, it is a difficult transition. On top of that, the girls have invented an imaginary (or is it?) guardian, Mama. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is the second weekend in a row that I catch Jessica Chastain, and this time her character couldn't be more different from the one in Zero Dark Thirty, also visually (from long red hair to short coal-black hair). Chastain has risen in a matter of just a few years to the very top of Hollywood. I loved her last year in ""Lawless"" and in 2011 in ""The Tree of Life"" and ""The Debt"". Here again her performance outshines everything else, including the special effects. To be honest, it is unlikely that I would've even gone to see this movie if Chastain were not in it. As to the 'horror' aspects of the movie, they were mostly derivative (yet another take on the ""spider"" walk outtake from the Exorcist, for example) but it all worked quite nicely. After the movie was over my initial reaction was that this was more about mother-like care for kids not your own than a true horror movie.

This movie was executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro who seems to have a knack for these types of movies (Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, Splice, etc.). Finally, it's a shame that they weren't able to find a way to get that Genesis song ""Mama"" (a hit single from their 1983 self-titled album) somehow into the movie or at least for the closing credits. Oh well. Meanwhile, if you are on the edge about seeing this movie, come for the horror and I will guarantee you'll stay for Jessica Chastain.",1358553600,,2421,4.462753950338601
5658992,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama is a good semi-creepy horror movie about two young children who spend five years alone in the woods and are later found and adopted by their uncle (the Kingslayer actor from Game of Thrones) and his wife (the always great Jessica Chastain in full goth mode, trading in her trademark red hair for black and sporting tattoos). Of course, something the children call ""Mama"" comes home with them and thus the horror begins. Maybe a little too much CGI used, but most of it looked okay. All in all, this is a well made ghost story that packs a few scares and has good acting throughout.",1358553600,56,586,4.485981308411215
5658993,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Good acting, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow...we have a winner!  This movie is nothing epic nor did it have the best scares I've seen in a while, but it's a horror movie that ""works.""

First time feature director Andrs Muschietti  (writer/director of the short film Mam) does a solid job with atmosphere and ""creepy.""  The story gets moving when two orphaned girls are discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods after five years somehow surviving on their own (now they're about 9 and 7 years old-ish).  Their eyes are cold and scared yet somehow predatory, their hair and skin far beyond wildly filthy, and their movement is so unnatural that it reminds me more of a Silent Hill monster than an animal.  More disturbing was the degeneration of their oral skills with the exception of whispering ""mama.""

Much to my surprise, the maternal poltergeist Mama was not a kept mystery.  Mama, her appearance, what she's capable of and her relationship with the girls are all presented to us right away.  So when the feral Victoria (Megan Charpentier; Resident Evil: Retribution, Red Riding Hood, Jennifer's Body) and Lilly are taken in by uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), the movie doesn't rely on us wondering when Mama will pop up and reign terror on the new foster parents.  Instead we watch the girls maintain a secret relationship with Mama while remaining emotionally distant from Lucas and Annabel.

But once their child psychologist and the new parents catch on to Mama's presence, simply a psychological manifestation or even a home invader by their perception, Mama feels threatened.  And once the girls begin to open up to the doctor or feel affection for their new parents, Mama gets pissed!  So we find ourselves not only nervous when we're ""normally"" nervous in these movies (e.g., walking in dark halls, opening the ajar closet door, looking over your shoulder to see what the girls are looking at), but we're also nervous when things wouldn't normally be unnerving...like when we see Annabel desperately hugging a thrashing Lilly, who starts to find the embrace comforting...I wonder if Mama is watching.

What's interesting is how this movie has such a simple story with one simple revelation toward its end, no red herrings and no real surprises--yet, it really works.  I thought they had some trouble making the finale at the end come together, actually I thought it was too drawn out and a bit weak, but overall I was VERY pleased with this movie.

We start out feeling edgy about the girls, and as they normalize we start feeling edgy about Mama (Javier Botet; creature actor of all three [REC] films).  And Mama is worth feeling edgy about.  She looks quite contorted, distorted and disturbing, moves like a bipedal yet quadriplegic demon on meth, and manifests an aura of decay.  I felt effectively continuously worried about what this apparition was going to do next, and the pace of the movie never disappoints.

I feel like we've been trained to find piss poor acting to be totally acceptable when it comes to horror.  But Mama's cast features nothing but competency and a few pleasant surprises.  Of course, no one should be shocked that Jessica Chastain pulled off the stand-offish girlfriend turned hesitant parent.  But what about young Megan Charpentier?  As the reserved older sister Victoria and her stone cold portrayal of The Red Queen in the latest Resident Evil installment she has all the makings of both one of the youngest Scream Queens ever, but also a talented young actress!

This movie was a pleasure with good characters, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow.  I look forward to watching this with an easily scared date on my couch in the dark.  ;)",1358467200,124,3886,4.822021116138763

Now that I've finally gotten to see it, I have mixed feelings. The first two-thirds of the movie are fine. As others have mentioned, however, I feel it loses its way in the last 30 minutes or so.

Some reviewers have objected to the overuse of CGI, but it isn't used as often as one might think.

The character of Mama is played by an actual person by the name of Javier Botet. He's 6'7"" and weighs less than 100 lbs. This is due to his having Marfan Syndrome, a disorder that also allows him to move his body and limbs in very unnatural ways. Just Google his name and/or search for it on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.

Yes, some digitizing was necessary to enhance Mama's appearance -- most notably, her hair. I don't know that it could have been done using practical effects. CGI is also used elsewhere for effects that, IMO, couldn't have been achieved any other way. But I never felt the movie was clobbering me with it.

There are jump scares, although none of them actually made me jump. I was never really scared, either, although Mama's ""voice"" and Lilly, the younger daughter, pretty much creeped me out.

Despite its flaws, I recommend Mama to anyone who enjoys horror and the supernatural. The film has a very unsettling atmosphere and effective, solid performances.",1527292800,,1377,4.488

Most are boring, predictable, and just down right yawn-fests...I had a little bit of a hard time really getting into this one since I had to keep the volume low so it didn't wake my twins from nap. It has a really slow beginning with stupid character syndrome but builds up after the first 20 minutes to give you just enough creep to keep you at least in your seat and paying attention, if not leaning forward a few times. The first actual visual we get of Mama sends the creep through the roof and legit had me seeing things (like her eyes... holy wow!) for a few hours.
The last half hour is where it really takes off like a rocket. Totally worth it. The animation for Mama is amazing and I think at some points is a stop motion effect, perhaps even filmed backwards like what was used in the Silent Hill movie for the Nurses scene.

However, the ending was so crazy my head is still spinning. SPOILER ALERT - so the ghost has logical and consistent motivation throughout the movie, she has spent 150 years searching for the bones of her baby, is finally reunited with baby's bones, has a few tender moments with them and then ... promptly drops the baby's bones on the floor like a trash bag (where they bizarrely slither away) and then she goes for the live girls instead, settles for one, kills her and the girl turns into a butterfly, or 100, I don't know.  Absolutely nuts, it was like the production crew all dropped acid on the last day of filming or something. It was completely ridiculous and spoiled an otherwise good movie.",1492387200,,944,4.579881656804734

5659163,3,B00BNH9O8I,"I have watched this movie a few times. I didn't think it was to scary. I did however find it creepy. I thought it had a strange ending.
Two little girls are left in an abandoned cabin in the woods. Their father  has taken them after he has landed himself in a bit of trouble. He wants to end their lives but as he's about to he angers a phantom named Mama and this is where it all starts. The father disappears and the two girls are found but are very different then they were when the first got to the cabin. They begin speaking of Mama but nobody is sure who Mama is. Their father's brother  and his girlfriend give the girls a place to stay. They start noticing weird things happening. Mama isn't happy and wants the girls to be with her. This movie is okay just not as scary as I had thought it would be.",1462924800,,808,4.0754716981132075

5659241,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Much better than I thought it would be.  Very much a ""de Toro film"" feel - same dark, beautiful film qualities, great atmosphere, unique character/monster designs, etc.  As per usual with de Toro, this movie is more of a Dark Fantasy story than a traditional Horror story - if you aren't familiar with other pieces of his work like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", think about it like the old original European/Grimm's fairy tales - gory, creepy, filled with dead bodies - definitely not Disney.  Without giving anything away, the ending is about as ""happy"" as would be possible in the setting of the movie.  Well acted, the kids are amazing, the artwork used during the titles and elsewhere is beautiful, tightly scripted, and ending comes full circle leaving the viewer strangely satisfied.  Good scares, used wisely, not just jumping out of your skin with loud sounds every 4mins.  If you like del Toro, definitely should watch.",1444608000,10,950,4.869565217391305

The girls who portrayed Lily and Victoria are truly phenomenal little actresses.

The story unfold beautiful. It was suspensful and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. The story affected me very deeply. I'm still trying to come to terms with how it ended.

5659269,4,B00BNH9O8I,"I was quite favourably surprised by this 2013 Spanish-Canadian film, officially presented as horror. It is an original, clever and quite atmospheric thing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins in 2008, at the worst moment of financial crisis, with a distraught stockbroker Jeffrey D'Asange (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) driving on a snowy road, with his children, three-year-old Victoria and one-year-old Lilly, in the backseat. They will ultimately arrive to an isolated, abandoned cabin in the woods - where very quickly it will become apparent, that SOMETHING already made this place it's den earlier... I will say nothing more about the story.

This is a highly original film with some ideas which I never saw adapted to the screen. Guillermo del Toro produced with film and his influence is visible here, as you will probably recognise some elements from ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (which he directed) and ""Orphanage"" (which he produced). I would say that this film is more or less on the same level as ""Orphanage"" but somehow inferior to ""Pan' Labyrinth"". Also, as both those previous films, this is definitely a quite dark opus.

Although officially a horror, this film quickly stops being scary (albeit it is definitely creepy until the end) and evolves into a psychological thriller with supernatural elements. As you will discover in the first minutes, there is without question a supernatural, dangerous entity in this film - but it is definitely NOT your standard issue monster from American straight to DVD Bminus movies. There is a deep conflict of interests here between human and not-really-human protagonists in ""Mama"" - and there is also the question of terrible, heart-breaking choices. This film didn't really scare me, but it kept me interested, tense and guessing how-the-heck-will-all-it-end until the very last seconds. The fact that fate of two little girls is the main object of the whole conflict makes the whole thing even more dramatic.

Grown up actors (Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) did a honest job, but the film reposes in great part on the amazing performance of child actresses, Megan Charpentier (Victoria), who was 12 at that time and Isabelle Nelisse, who I think was not older than 7. The director managed to guide those two kids in an absolutely incredible way! Those two kids really will blow your mind!

Bottom line, this is very honest, very watchable film, more psychological thriller with supernatural elements, than a real horror, but most certainly a very original thing. A recommended viewing! ENJOY!",1441843200,,2586,5.206730769230769

This is NOT film for the immature.  If you still insist Rose only falls asleep at the end of Titanic, this ending is not for you.  It requires maturity to see the beauty of it.  It requires much more compassion and empathy for ""the villain"" than these films normally ask.
Despite the profound story line, the scares do not suffer.  Much is actor driven, but the actual ghost/spirit, or whatever Mama is, is pure scare delight!
She has an odd shaped head, though, which put me off once I saw it was always odd shaped.  I don't understand that but it doesn't take away form the story.",1440720000,,741,4.492537313432836

5659290,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Like most horror films, the writers/directors just don't know how to bring it to an effective close.  I loved the film until the very end (climax and resolution - if you can call it that).  Great premise, good writing, great acting.  The child actors were great and the fusion of the back story with the current plot was effective. Plenty of jumps and creepy moments; great use of lighting and peeks of the monster without revealing too much -- until the end.  Then it became trite and cheesy.  I wish it either went all in (for a truly tragic and shocking end) or it ended where it should have (spoiler)

SPOILER:

By that I mean that both Lucas and Annabelle needed to die and leave the children under Mama's watchful care again -- or completely come up with a different ending.  The fact that the movie (and ghost) didn't rest when Mama was reunited with the remains of her baby was meant to be shocking and deviant from the typical horror film like The Ring, but it wasn't as workable.  That said, Lily could not have functioned in the real world as well and she clearly was happy being with her ghostly maternal figure; however, it seemed like a cop out to have Victoria now in the care of both of the living adults who she bonded with.  I thought ""mama"" had ripped his heart out, but he appears to be doing well without it.",1437264000,,1329,4.387755102040816

Having worked with the public schools, generally whenever I see a film involving kids I end up picking out the falsities, but this film was spot-on character.  Clearly the director did his homework.  I will definitely watch this time and again as there is a lot of information throughout to process and it can't be done in one sitting.  I also enjoy movies like this for that very reason.  It's fun to go back and fish for details or catch another clue that might lead to the outcome.  Guillermo Del Toro has a real future in this field for sure!",1434153600,,663,4.559322033898305

It certainly is much better than most paranormal schlock that's put out these days.

5659375,3,B00BNH9O8I,"I spent the whole movie thinking the doctor was played by Tony Shalhoub! My fault for not reading the credits first.

This was a quite promising film and put forth some interesting ideas and visuals but somehow it never really explored the REALLY intriguing aspects of this story and the buildup was too slow paced...by which I don't mean nothing was explained; it was explained almost too much. I would have liked more ""show"" than ""tell.""  Also when something has a reveal so factual, a film must have more going for it than great acting or a good script to draw you in to see it more than once as a one-trick pony. It would need a terrific soundtrack, great special effects or great cinematography and production design to have you want to visit it again and again. There must be more levels to the entertainment aspect. Needs atmosphere. They had some great snow scenes, great creepy woods scenes, etc. but none of this was really used for as much effect as it might have been. I also felt that Jessica Chastain's character could not be rightfully called ""goth"" as she was too pragmatic. I would picture a goth girl as being completely drawn to the idea of finding the children and maybe even finding the place herself, and enthralled by the backstory, not creeped out.

The buildup to the reveal was too intercut with almost silly scenes that took the tension down quite a few notches for me. The ending was what I was expecting. I didn't have a problem with it at all though it was a bit emotionally manipulative. The actors, especially the kids, were great in their roles. Film refs: L'Enfant Sauvage, The Ring, Misery, and The Blair Witch Project.

I give it only 3 stars because I don't need a dramatic crashing noise to show me something is scary. Worse, ever feel like the backstory would have made the better movie? I enjoyed it though.",1424563200,,1847,4.587878787878788

5659381,3,B00BNH9O8I,"*******SPOILERS******

Man, I wanted this movie to scare the piss out of me and the setup is more or less fantastic, but as soon as Del Toro reveals mama, you start seeing her way too much.

I also didn't like how pre-reveal she kills people no problem, but after the reveal as the relationship between the kids/mama/new parents is unraveling now she is throwing around people and dragging them as opposed to 1-hit-killing the first two people she killed at the beginning/middle of the movie... that seemed ""out of character"" since her goal seems to ultimately just be the only parent to the girls.

The reveal at the end up on the cliff was WAY too much... I was actually bored of Mama at this point and her plight -- I think we are like 3 flashbacks into her history by then and I just didn't care.

I thought Del Toro redeemed it a bit by choosing a harder/grimmer ending by having Mama suicide along with the youngest child and the older stay with the new parents as opposed to ""everyone living happily ever after"".

Would be on the fence about recommending to folks that want to be scared... I saw the trailer and thought I would crap my pants, but during the movie too much is shown -- I felt the exact same way about Babadook.",1424044800,,1233,4.41409691629956

5659396,5,B00BNH9O8I,"What an interesting film. It doesn't fit neatly into the normal psychological horror pigeon-hole; it is a sort-of supernatural mystery thriller. Not to say that there aren't some excellent scares, it is just that they are not the raison d'tre of the movie.

Based around the old feral children idea, the story opens with the murder of the children's mother and subsequent disappearance of their father in an abandoned woodland cabin. The children are left to fend for themselves while the father's twin brother searches for them relentlessly. The children are found five years later and returned to `civilisation' but is something still watching over them? Oh yes indeed.

The production, casting and direction lends the film a classy European feel which sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood horrors; slower paced, noticeably less formulaic and stylishly atmospheric with an unusual sadness and sympathy for the supernatural entity. The two children are absolutely superb and while the supporting cast are good, they are a little monolithic. A most unusual supernatural thriller and well worth several viewings; thrilling, scary and sad all at the same time.",1421452800,,1170,5.318918918918919

5659399,4,B00BNH9O8I,"It's probably one of the better Del Toro movies I've seen. I'm not a big fan of his movies, but this one looked and was very interesting. It started off good, and the middle action parts were good but there's always a point in Del Toro movies where it loses its momentum by trying to reconcile the muddled plotline that it's created for itself about half way through. The story in this one wasn't overly complicated, so there were less chances for it to go totally off the rails. I understand that my criticism goes against what I actually like in horror films (interesting storyline, interesting characters, intense buildup, high creepiness) but what I don't like is something that tries too hard. This didn't try that hard, a lot of it seemed effortless. It's like he tried to make something a little bit more mainstream. The main character Jessica Chastain was very good. She kept the whole suspense and energy to the movie. I like kids, but was happy not to see one as the lead character. It's a strong four-star picture.",1421280000,3,1025,4.637362637362638

5659422,3,B00BNH9O8I,"This is an incredibly impressive first feature film for the director. And the story has a great deal of emotional depth. It also features a few scenes which are now among my favorite scary and creepy moments in movies. I feel it's quite brave to feature a heroine who some people may find rather unsympathetic. She's believably selfish and hesitant or unwilling to commit to some massive responsibilities which get foisted on her. I wish I could give it four stars, and I wanted to, but... WHY did it have to become a Hollywood green-screen mish-mash at the end (don't worry, nothing spoilery here, since so many movies just do this anyway, it's become obligatory)? I get the impression that the director wanted it to become somewhat classic fairy-tale-like in its unreal look but the thing that hooked me up until that part is that the weirdness took place within the MUNDANE. The EVERYDAY. Freaky stuff in an ordinary closet or under an ordinary bed. A little hole in a wall suddenly taking on sinister significance. AWESOME stuff. But the departure from that, combined with the credibility-stretching cliche' (annoying in a film which defies so many clich's) of smart people not having the sense to TURN ON MORE LLIGHTS IN THE **** HOUSE (especially one where someone else is PAYIG the utilities FOR them) once creepy things start happening there. Who in their right mind would allow there to be so many shadowy corners and hallways once they've been so obviously FREAKED OUT by something which could be THREATENING SMALL CHILDREN? And why would someone insist on going to a place he's never been, in the middle of nowhere, where he KNOWS he's going to find something creepy, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT with nothing but a single flashlight? To sustain mood? I'm sorry, but, when so much of the film shines with an oppressive vibe sustained so skillfully and subtly it's a shame when it becomes unbelievable seemingly just to look scary. HOWEVER, I definitely recommend the film, with CAUTION if you are sensitive to things happening to small children and to seeing them threatened. (I wish we'd been told more about what their father had actually DONE and maybe why) I look forward to seeing what the director will do with this experience behind him. Hopefully less of the cgi effects stuff. Been there. Seen that. LOTS. HOWEVER, kudos for not showing much of ""mama"" and for some of the ways ""mama"" is shown moving about and through things.",1417996800,2,2443,4.791469194312796

5659438,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama is a horror film that deals with the story of two young girls abandoned in a forest cabin, fostered by an unknown entity that they fondly call Mama, which eventually follows them to their new suburban home after their uncle retrieves them. When they are rescued years later and begin a new life, they find that someone or something still wants to come tuck them in at night. The day their father killed their mother, sisters Victoria and Lilly vanished near their suburban neighborhood. For five long years, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel, have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home.

It delivers good old fashioned scares without cheap gross-out and even moves us by its surprising and effectively executed lengthy climactic sequence. Also,it is very European in its direction, aesthetic and narrative that it possesses a strong, emotional core that will surprise those jaded by some of the lazier horror titles of late. There are lots of shocks but no real surprises in it. But inspite of the clichs and overly repetitive plot structure,it is a well-played, well-shot horror flick as it doesn't treat audiences as nave fools.

5659444,5,B00BNH9O8I,"As an aficionado of a certain type of horror movie (namely the ghost story film), I have watched many over the past thirty or so years.  Several stand out-- ""The Shining,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Others,"" ""The Grudge"", and ""The Woman in Black,"" to name a few.  In each of these films, expert writing, directing, acting, and/or conception combine and produce a work that is both frightening and moving.  That is, the horror is almost unbearable, since (along with the supernatural terror) a viewer is drawn into the story by human pity, empathy, and compassion.  ""Mama"" takes its place in this list.  The quasi-fairy tale/realistic setting, the performance and blocking of the actors, plot twists, and judicious use of CGI effects create a supernatural masterpiece, spellbinding and cathartic.  On the simplest level, the film is about parenting skills: good parenting, bad parenting, and supernatural parenting.  It illustrates that the dead who still walk among us need (as much as the living) to love and care for children.  The scenario may seem preposterous, but I have come to accept this premise on its own terms, with each viewing of the film.  As with each previous film on the list, I will ponder the question of whether another producer, director, or writer will conceive an equally enthralling film in the future.",1415318400,,1324,5.0091324200913245

5659471,5,B00BNH9O8I,"THE BEST horror movie EVER. What is different about ""Mama"" is that the ""evil spirit"", Mama, is a real character with a backstory, has motivation, and is devoted to the children. We see her fully and get to know her, unlike so many movie demons (ahem, Blair Witch). So often, the murderous central character is just a ""vampire"", ""demon"" ""witch""- insert whatever suits you- with no explanation as to why or how they came to be so intent on killing. They're just bad. I am a lover of the horror genre, and this has always been a problem for me: I want to know more about the monster. Then, in most horror movies, the ""hero"" triumphs over aforementioned bad character, and the neat story line is ""good always triumphs over evil- the end"". Well, all of the characters in ""Mama"" are flawed- Mama actually seems to be the sanest of the bunch- and the story is resolved in a excellent, satisfying ending, with no loose ends. A rare feat, indeed. The greatest criticism of ""Mama"" that I've read is that it isn't original. Well, this movie takes what's been done before and does it better, more beautifully, and with better pacing. Oh, it has the fun stuff- you know who is going to die way before they do- just how and when will leave you hanging. See it- even if you're not a horror fan!",1412208000,2,1279,4.446808510638298

5659485,5,B00BNH9O8I,"This film is a creepy modern classic! My skin crawled and I jumped several times during this well-made and tense mind-bending horror film. This is not for the squeamish and it will make you shutter and shake. This is a film that combines the tale of two feral children (two small girls) who  grow up in a cabin in the forest and cared for by an apparition-like female called 'Mama.""

After their father goes berserk and kills several people, including their mother, two girls (Megan Charpentier as Victoria and Isabelle Nelisse as Lilly)  are kidnapped and left to fend for themselves in an abandoned cabin. After five years, the girls have gone feral are found. They are initially  cared for by a caring child psychologist, Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) and eventually given to the girl's Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Walda) and his rock-n-roll girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). In time, both they and the doctor realize that the girls fictional mother figure of Mama is a real being with a bad attitude and a hold on the girls, especially on Lilly. As Dr. Dreyfuss uncovers the truth behind the ghostly woman of the forest, he begins to formulate a theory and take on the paranormal existence of Mama. The film builds to a crescendo and we all soon discover what it is that mama wants - or at least we do for awhile.

The cats is excellent in a tale of real terror. Javier Botet delivers a stunningly horrifying portrayal of Mama and his voice (provided by Melina Matthews and Laura Guiteras) is equally creepy and demonic. The little girls, especially, Ms. Nelisse are fantastic! The ending is a bit of a downer but it keeps in line with the feel of this dark and disconcerting horror film.",1409788800,,1695,4.712837837837838

Jessica Chastain is the hero, almost unrecognizable in her black wig, but as full of vim and vinegar as ever. Nicolai Coster-Waldau is beautiful as ever in a dual role. The little kids are terrific and the terror level is on high at all times. Very creepy and loads of fun. The Blu effect adds a bit of creepiness. Recommended.

5659489,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama starts off better than it ends up being.  It has some brilliant acting by the child actors who play the two sisters abducted from their home by the father, their vehicle runs off the road and they end up in an isolated shack in the forest for four years.  You see characters who are supposed to be 'feral"" for want of a better word in a fair few movies these days, but these little girls, especially the youngest one do a brilliant and believable job of this.  The movie is obviously low budget with scenes such as the youngest girl playing tug of war with something but you can only see her through the door.  Like Jaws, they probably should have hidden the monster for the entire film, as when it does appear it looks like a badly drawn piece of CGI, I'm not sure if they were trying to have it look scary or gross but it didn't achieve either.  It's like those in the studio said, ""Well we paid a lot of money for those computer nerds to make this monster, I don't care how bad it looks, we're using it anyway.  Because we paid for it that's why!""

The movie was pretty predictable, the plot has been done countless times before.  Worth watching if you can do so for free or something when it comes on TV one day, but nothing special really.",1409097600,,1249,4.2405063291139244

5659500,3,B00BNH9O8I,"This is the third movie produced by Guillermo Del Toro that I've seen - the others were Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and Splice - and for some reason what I love about his own movies does not translate to his producer projects.

Mama has a great premise and is well made on a technical level but the script really needed a few more passes before going before the cameras. Without giving anything away, my criticisms are that the film chooses the wrong protagonist (Anabel, er, ""portrayed"" (?) by Jessica Chastain) and far too many side characters who do everything *she* should be doing; there are too many flashbacks, too much exposition, and the two little girls at the heart of the story are often left on the sidelines.

*SPOILERS*

There's also a weird psychology to the film: Lucas (Nicolaj Waldau) wants children, spends all his money searching for his lost nieces over a five year period, does all the sleuthing Anabel should be doing, in half the time it takes her (when evidence of what's going on is all around her in her own home!) from a *hospital* bed, gets out of said sickbed, wrangles a rented vehicle, finds the long-lost missing piece to the puzzle and shows up to rescue everyone - but in the end, it takes one strike by Mama to put him down for the climax and it;s Anabel who - perhaps through super Fem-Powers no man can comprehend - gets to be the heroine. Huh? This could easily have been solved in the writing stage by giving all the sleuthing and heroics to Anabel and showing how caring for these fragile children awakens the nurturing mother in her. But no, she simply keeps getting up, like Rocky Balboa, for absolutely no good narrative or logical reason. What is glaringly obvious is that Victoria should have been the central protagonist and heroine and the whole film should have been shown through her eyes. The climax would have been far more powerful if it had just been between her, Lily and Mama, with the adults showing up after the fact.

(END SPOILERS)

5659539,5,B00BNH9O8I,"MAMA is a slick, stylish and scary flick from master horror producer Guillermo Del Toro and newbie director Andy Muschietti.  MAMA delivers plenty of screams and cover-your-eyes, plug your ears moments, as well as a great story and terrific cast, a hat trick that is a rare occurance within the ho hum horror genre of recent years.  There are no giant masked men chasing dopey teens through a forest in MAMA,  Instead this thoughtful and dark (and I mean DARK) drama features the ghost of an uber creepy madwoman who is both terrifying and pitiful, two rather disturbing young girls who love and fear her and, our heroine, a former grunge rock queen who doesn't even like kids.  Go figure.

MAMA opens as Lucas, the father of little Victoria and Lily (darling little girls, these two), a banker with money and marriage troubles, kills his colleagues and wife, then takes the girls into what looks like the frozen tundra, all in order to kill them, then himself.  After his car skids off of a mountain road, the trio find a deserted cabin (filled with what looks like really fabulous vintage furniture).  Dad pulls a pistol out to dispense with the older of the girls, Victoria (around 5 years old or so).  As he shakily aims, a dark, floating presence grabs and kills him.  Victoria and her little sister Lily (around 2 I'd say) are left alone in this creepy cabin.  Well not alone. They've got Mama to care for them, and over the next five years this skinny, angular ghoulish figure feeds the girls cherries (I have no idea why, aside from the fact that cherries are known as the ""Devils Fruit"") and cares for them as only a ghost can.  That is to say, not really at all.

The girls, when finally found by their Dad's brother, are as feral as cats, filthy and scampering about the cabin in a very odd manner. Not since Regan spider-walked down the stairs in THE EXORCIST have children looked so darned disturbing moving about on all fours.  The girls are moved to a psychiatric facility in preparation for placement with their uncle Jeffrey and his girlfriend Annabelle. And guess who comes along for the ride.

Jessica Chastain plays Annabelle (and by the way, is there any better young actress out there right now?  Chastain is just marvelous in everything, including MAMA), main squeeze of Uncle Jeffrey.  With her Joan Jett black shag and tattoo sleeves, Annabelle is not a motherly figure, in fact the film opens as she thanks her lucky stars that a pregnancy test she has just taken is negative.  But because she loves Jeffrey, Annabelle  give motherhood the old college try, although mothering these two very messed up young girls, now 6 and 11, would challenge Mother Goose herself.  Unfortunately Mama takes poor Uncle Jeffrey out as soon as the new family moves in together, and as he lies in a coma, Annabelle is left to deal with the girls and their ghostly savior, who is also more than a little jealous.

Tied up in this nightmare is the girls psychiatrist, who pretends to have their welfare at heart but is actually searching for proof of the paranormal, as well as another relative, an Aunt who doesn't think Jeff and Annabelle have what it takes to parent these poor little nutcases.  Lily in particular is disturbed past the point of redemption.  To her, Mama is a real parent, far more real than Jeffrey and Annabelle, and Lily cannot make the jump to any kind of normal childlike behavior, continuing to eat weird stuff (mostly moths!) and play with a gibbering, cavorting (and jointless, it seems) MAMA, who is seen peeking out of the closet, from under the bed, or just about anywhere that will really, really scare you.  Victoria, who was able to retain some language skills and has at least some memory of an ordered life, is more adaptable, and as she becomes closer to Annabelle, becomes ever more fearful of Mama's jealous rages.

The film travels to the logical conclusion of a horror film of this sort, the final fight between Mama and Annabelle for the lives of the children.  And even though the ending is, for the most part, predictable, the journey is so darkly told, so evocative and creepy that MAMA will play around the corners and edges of your memory long after watching it.  This is a horror story of the first degree, with lots of jump in your seat scares and plenty of hold your breath moments.  I loved it!

I'd recommend watching MAMA a few times.  I had to, because the first time I sat through it I was so darned terrified that more than half of the movie went unwatched (my eyes were closed and my fingers were in my ears).  There are lots of interesting little tidbits that only become apparent upon the second or even third viewing.  For example, watch the vignette of the drawings that the girls make that takes place under the opening titles.  It will give you some great insight as to how the girls lived in the forest those five years (what's up with those dead raccoons?).  The cherry thing is never explained (the mountain of cherry pits in the cabin is just plain weird), but you'll understand MAMA better if you can watch it without putting your hands over your eyes.

This is a definite five star movie, in my humble opinion.  I love a good horror film, but really good ones are few and far between.  MAMA is everything a great horror flick should be.  Well crafted, interesting and most importantly, scarier than s***!  Watch it in the dark, with someone you love.  Now that's entertainment!",1393977600,,5451,4.620976116303219

By embracing and exploring one of the most profound bonds in nature (mother/child), the filmmakers did far more than make the ""evil spirit"" in this movie a one-dimensional lunatic - she is sympathetic and even admirable in her strive to protect ""her"" children; and Jessica Chastain's character, who is thrust, ready-or-not-here-we-go (which is pretty much like actual motherhood), into the role of surrogate mom, finds her own nurturing center through all the craziness erupting around her.

What might have been a very effective horror tale was just (in my opinion anyway) utterly ruined by the heavy overload of poorly executed and unneeded CGI, and the ending...I mean, please. Rather than being horrified or emotionally moved (which clearly was what the director was aiming for), I just found it laughably lame, trite, and cheesy, and again, and ending absolutely overwhelmed with bad CGI.

I love what I consider to be great horror, or even good horror films, given how difficult they can be to find and given the amount of trash 'horror' films produced annually. I had high hopes for this, as it could have been good, but in my opinion the filmmakers just simply missed the mark, and left mainly a steaming pile of disappointment and missed opportunity behind themselves here.

Something has kept them safe through all those years and follows them back to civilisation.

What follows is a ghost story with a vengeful spirit, which might not sound like anything new and on the face of it, it isn't. However the execution is what sets this apart from others of its ilk, the ghost is quite disturbing and there's good build up throughout the film. The other aspect is the two girls, they are really creepy and really add to the tension of the film.

The pacing is spot on, building from merely creepy to all out mental and the ending is fantastic, not the usual conclusion to these type of films at all. My only complaint was that it did rely a little too much on shocks for scares, which is a shame as it does creepy very well.

Who says all ghosts have to kill everyone for no reason?  Mama is the story of Lilly and Victoria who are raised by an entity called Mama after their father has a bad day at the office and decides his, and the rest of his family's, life is over.  The uncle and his I-don't-want-no-children girlfriend, Annabelle, are left to raise Lilly and Victoria.  After Annabelle is forced to take care of the girls because Uncle boyfriend has an accidental fall (thanks to Mama), she discovers her own maternal instincts and takes a liking to Victoria and Lilly.  Meanwhile, the psych doctor has discovered that the girls know Mama to be a crazy mother from the 1800's who committed a partially failed suicide.  I say partially failed because she was trying to kill herself and her baby by jumping off of a cliff (which remarkably resembled Pride Rock from The Lion King).  They baby was snagged on a limb and only Mama made the successful suicide.  So Mama died without her baby - which the nuns from the church were trying to keep her from.  When crazy dad takes the girls into the woods to kill himself and them, Mama intervenes and snaps dad's neck - saving the girls.

So Mama has spent the last few years raising the girls - feeding them cherries, singing to them, taking them on midnight joy rides through the air, and protecting them (they do a good job of portraying this in the credits - very clever).  But when Uncle Brother's search team finds the girls, Mama isn't happy.

So this isn't your typical ""I want everyone dead - because I can"" movie.  Mama only wants her girls.  Mama dwells with the girls at the new house unbeknownst to Annabelle.  That is until the good doctor digs too deep and threatens to interfere.  So Mama takes him out and decides it's time to take the girls to the only place where she can be with them without anyone interfering - ""Pride Rock"".  Annabelle and Uncle Brother try to save them by giving Mama the remains of her dead baby from long ago.  But really, which would you rather have - a sack of dried up bones?  Or two living children?  Victoria (the oldest) has taken a liking to Annabelle, but Lilly loves creepy Mama - seemingly because that's really all she knows.  What's interesting is that Mama doesn't kill Annabelle because she supposedly promised Victoria that she wouldn't.  With her last bit of strength, Annabelle clings to Victoria to stop her from going over the cliff.  Mama shows some compassion and lets Annabelle keep Victoria.  The movie ends with Mama going over the cliff with Lilly.  They are cloaked in some dark shroud and burst into a cloud of black moths after they hit the same branch that Mama's baby was snagged on.  Roll credits.

Ok - so 'Mama' has a decent hook.  You get a silhouette of Mama in the first 10 minutes and the credits do a good job of portraying some needed exposition.  And it's interesting to see that Mama is doing what she does best - being a protective Mama.  So when Uncle Brother comes along, you can sympathize with someone taking 'her kids'.

All three acts are pretty clear.  The change comes when Mama is done tolerating everyone trying to take her kids away.  The climax could have been a bit more suspenseful.  It seems to have more story than scary bits.  Which isn't a total waste, but they really could have had Mama play more of her creepy self.  You really only get a lot of Mama near the end of act 2 and 3.  The acting was pretty good.  How they get younger kids to do what they do is pretty amazing.  The little girl who plays Lilly was great.  Annabelle, Jessica Chastain, is the clear protagonist and is an identifiable character.  Uncle Brother wasn't very useful - but effective.

I watched this movie twice if that says anything.  I thought it had a good story - like Insidious.  But if you're looking in your face scary parts - you might be better with something like Paranormal Activity.",1388448000,3,3920,4.514935988620199

The creators did an amazing job by making the movie scary enough to keep you entertained without overwhelming you.

***FASCINATING SIDE NOTE*** ~ For those that are not already aware, ""Mama,"" was played by extraordinary 6'ft 7"" MALE creature performer/actor, Javier Botet, who has Marfan syndrome, causing above average height, elongation of limbs/fingers/toes, abnormally flexible joints and the ability to dislocate them - producing a twisted and unnatural appearance. Despite many viewers assumptions that ""Mama"" was primarily created using digital effects, the elements used to produce her distorted appearance were primarily achieved without the use of CGI- i.e. 8 hours of makeup, prosthetic finger extensions and attaching wires to Botet's body to pull him in unnatural directions (using his ability to become disjointed and essentially operating him like a marionette), resulting in a very creepy and disturbing ""Mama.""

5659601,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Horror films for the most part have been a disappointment in the last few decades. They either rely on jolt scares or excessive gore to compensate for atmosphere and a good creepy story. 'Mama' has a little of all those things I mentioned, but never using them to propel the story or to give you false goose bumps.

I was impressed with 'Mama' as it delivers much more than I expected it to. It's got a pretty creepy ghost story and I can't remember that last time I watched a horror film and genuinely felt creeped out wondering what was behind that door or what they were going to see next. Besides the good creep factor, it also has some pathos, which is sorely missed from a lot of horror films today, I mean, who will ever forget Karloff's portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster? Or Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man? Those films just wouldn't be the same without them. Mama has a little of this going for it too as the ghost in the story which I found creepy as hell (even if a little bizarre looking) also makes you have some empathy for this unfortunate creature or spirit. Sure there are some contrivances, but what horror film doesn't have those?

If you're looking for a somewhat old fashioned chiller then Mama may be something you want to check out. Turn the lights out and take a look at Mama!  The Blu Ray looks and sounds great and there are some interesting extras to check out after the film.",1385424000,3,1401,4.401544401544402

5659610,5,B00BNH9O8I,"My bias is going to come out here, but I do prefer gothic horror and love the dark fantastique. Mama by Guillermo del Toro is not quite as good as Pan's Labyrinth but more horrific overall. The effects of the children themselves in the movie are some of the most weirdly horrifying I've witnessed on film. What the Grudge did for the possession walk of the Exorcist, Mama takes to a whole new menacing level. I've heard complaints that the actual ghost of Mama could have been more horrifying and less cartoonish, but to me it was powerfully moving. The key, once you see and get to know her, is to begin to identify with her and feel her pain. Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain, is the analogue to Mama in the world of the living with whom we are also to identify. The link between Annabel, Mama and us is deliberately crafted be del Toro and beautifully so in my opinion. True horror is about story, a particular kind of story; a story that reaches inside us and twists something--it never leaves us, but haunts our memories, heart and dreams ever after. If you are like me, Mama may do that for you.",1384300800,,1104,4.416666666666667

5659627,5,B00BNH9O8I,"Let me ask you a question.  Are you somebody who thinks the freakiest scene in the Exorcist is when the little girl surprises her mother by walking down the stairs backwards like a spider and throws up on the floor?  If so, Mama is *certainly* a movie for you!  That is the scariest scene I've EVER witnessed in a horror movie.  The timing of it makes it scary because I certainly didn't see it coming, but also just the idea of a girl darting down the stairs in such an awkward way... TRULY a memorable moment of scary movie writing there!  Mama basically delivers in the same way.

However with that said, I honestly didn't understand some of the storyline pertaining to Mama.  I get that two daughters lost their parents, lived alone in a house in the woods for 5 years, developed wild instincts, and had to learn to defend themselves from danger before being found, and I understand that this is a horror movie so for the sake of telling a frightening storyline, some kind of supernatural force had to be included to make the girls act differently from the average person secluded away for many years (such as the Exorcist example I mention above which is used here on quite a few occasions) and of course we know the uncle and his rock star girlfriend has to try and raise the girls the best they can (even though the girlfriend is less than interested in raising kids, and only doing so for the purpose of supporting her partner).  I didn't really quite understand why they had to live in a house picked out for them, though.  If they didn't live in this specific house, they wouldn't be able to raise the girls.  I can't speak from experience, but this doesn't seem realistic to me.  Even the girls friend comments that it's weird.

All this stuff makes sense to me, but what I don't understand is all the stuff pertaining to the Mama entity other than she developed a trust with the girls while they were secluded away and living on their own, and that she can control them through fear and supernatural ways.  The girls understand Mama's behavior as well as Mama knows their behavior.  They've developed an unbreakable bond I guess you could say.  What really frightens me is when you see the Mama demon standing quietly in the background and then she suddenly RUNS or floats directly in front of the camera!  This movie works amazingly well combining both psychological and jump scares.  You obviously jump when Mama suddenly darts across the room, but it's really mind-twisting when you see what Mama's face looks like and the way she moves on the walls and inside the floorboards.

Also, the dream portion of the storyline that the rockstar woman has with the stabbed nuns and the screaming baby... I can't recall the last time such a realistic portrayal of a dream actually occurred in a movie before, if ever.  This is *exactly* how I dream, with one scene immediately shifting somewhere else in the blink of an eye that feels like a perfectly natural transition even though it's not.  In this case, a woman appearing in church and then suddenly appearing outside holding and running away with a baby in her arms.  The exceptionally bright background while all this is going on is incredibly realistic and reminiscent of a dream as well because in dreamland, everything looks brighter (or darker, depending on the cicumstances) than in reality.  Excellent job by the people who created this segment!  Now do I know what this segment actually means pertaining to the storyline?  Not really.  I have my ideas however.

While quite often it's understandable to poke fun at Hollywood's exaggerated and unsatisfying attempts at movie writing these days (especially when it concerns horror) Mama is a movie that actually gets it right mostly because the film executes in all the key areas.  It has atmosphere, wonderful timing, children often moving awkwardly in dark hallways effectively sending chills through your spine, the Mama character never appearing while the parents are around for quite a bit of the storytelling during the first half, and most importantly, the Mama character herself is EXTREMELY frightening due to special effects that can only be described as otherworldly and highly unusual.  These are the kind of special effects that remind viewers what it is they love about scary houses.  While the lack of compassion between the rockstar girlfriend and the two sisters may be a sign of bad acting, and even though I may have misunderstood Mama's decisions (without spoiling it) during the final 20 minutes, it doesn't change the enjoyment, fear or fascination I felt leading up to that point so I must give in and award the film 5 stars.  It really left me satisfied.  Hollywood got it right for once!",1382227200,,4729,4.744498777506112
5659628,4,B00BNH9O8I,This is one of those scary movies that provide the scare factor that lingers on long after the movie is over.

5659633,2,B00BNH9O8I,"Director of this movie is Guillermo Del Torro.  The first movie made by him I saw was Pan's Labyrinth.  I saw it in the movies several years ago and it was first film in years that made me cry.  It was also a film that made this director famous.  He definitely deserves status of one of the most talented directors.  Soon aferwards he directed one of the Harry Potter movies (the scariest one of them all).  Surely, when I saw his new film ""Mama"" in my local library I had to check it out.

This is a film about two young girls whose parents die.  They spend years living in abandoned cottage in the mountains and once they are found everyone is surprised how they managed to survive.  They barely speak, do not walk normally and are intensively protective of each other.  Their only living relative, their father's brother and his live-in girlfriend decide to take care of them and help them adjust to the normal life.

But, something if off.  Girls are traumatized and their strange behavior seems to be over the top at times.  As it turns out they have a protector they call Mama who will go to any extreme, no matter how evil to keep girls to herself.  Her love is so jealous that no one is allowed close to girls she considers her own.  I will leave it at this.  You can watch the movie and be the judge of it yourself.  Film has many amazing special effects and scary moments.  But as a fan, I must admit that it is far cry from ""Pan's Labyrinth"".  Del Torro can do better.

The scares are genuine and the movie is exciting to watch but a weak ending makes it simply an average fare.  I loved the use of the classic horror story elements cabin in the woods, ghosts, sudden noises.
The film opens up with the kidnap of two girls by their father who after speeding away from the city loses control of his car in the woods. Five years pass and the uncle Lucas( Nikloj Coster - Waldau) almost gives up looking for these kids,  Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her younger sibling Lily (Isabelle Nlisse), when they are discovered. They have turned almost feral and a disturbing force that they call Mama follow them everywhere they go. Both Lucas and his girlfriend are tormented by this figure.

Although Mama is typical ghost story; kind of predicable if you know I mean, but is better then most ghost movies that's been produce lately.

Also, if Mama looked a little more human I'd have found her scarier. The performances were good, despite the ultimate lame-ness of the plot.

5659686,5,B00BNH9O8I,"I hardly know where to begin discussing a film that moves me so. Yes, it's a kind of ghost story, and perhaps the best I've seen since""Ghost Story."" Those who say it is derivative may feel that way because the tale draws on archetypal images, fears, the kind of history that brings forth both ghosts and our (reluctant) belief in their possible existence. So yes, ghost story, certainly. Again, kind of.

But it's much more than that. It's a look at belonging in one world or the next, and raises questions, blurring the line as sweetly and poignantly as del Toro's wonderful ""The Orphange,"" or to a lesser extent, ""The Devil's Backbone."" There is a moment near the end that will refocus the entire film. It's magnificent.

At the level of pure cinema, it's beautifully done, with sensitive cinematography and spot-on editing, acting that makes you forget acting, and a character arc in the Jessica Chastain character that is as startling as it is believable. Effects are subtle most of the time. There are scary moments, but always there is that rich campfire feeling of a great fable, a story from early man's deepest and most intimidating questions. It is a tragic tale that rises fully to that difficult status, and then bursts through into something quite different, and very beautiful.

In the end, ""Mama"" is a story of love, of rage, of nurturance and danger, of sacrifice, and of mystery. I love what the brother/sister team of Andrs and Barbara Muschietti have created, I treasure the clear and pervasive influence of Guillermo del Toro, his ability to dance with such effortless grace between two worlds. If ""Mama"" touches you as it does me, you will hold onto your copy for dear life. If not, it's a fun ghost story, and that's fine. But it is so very much more.",1377302400,2,1773,4.712903225806452

5659702,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama is a unique horror film, because unlike most horror flicks that come to mind like Resident Evil this doesn't so much try to frighten you as disturb. Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street and it's ilk, it's not a slasher that scares you with disturbing violence, and unlike Cabin in the Woods (also very worth a watch) it doesn't try to be unique, it just is (especially in an American market, not so much in European and Asian). What makes it so unique to my experience is that its not a horror movie for horror's sake, but rather the horror is a vehicle to tell a tale of a tragedy, and although the tragedy is there, the focus here is not on that so much as the result of it.

So, basically we have a tragic event, which interacts with another tragic event (which if it were played out would be a tragedy) and what do tragic events lead to? Lack of resolution and thus ghosts. Now, I'm a little conflicted in saying ""ghost"" because you're never told that's what is going on and you might substitute in another creature of sorts, because it doesn't quite follow the normal ghost stereo type with some things that head into the demon, though that doesn't line up with the back story, so I'll just simplify and say ""ghost"". And if you worry I've given too much away, we're about five minutes into the film.

Mama in some ways is very open about what is going on with the audience and in others it ... almost hides things. It also sort of twists around the events that (while maybe not altering the predictability of the end game) make it an interesting ride. It's not cluttered or sloppy or badly structured, in fact it's very tidy, tight, well thought out. It just isn't going to be quite what you expect it and that is why it's probably getting a fair few good reviews.

Okay, so story is interesting and different. Acting, because it relies so heavily on the two girls, is a little bit strained: there is not enough nuance in emotions, and many feel like over reactions. One could dismiss that as ""we don't know what they've been through"" and so maybe its justified. Actually talking about what they've been through, between act 1 (the setup) and act 2 (the main events) there is a five year period, which is where the intro credits roll. And in the back ground are like child drawings of what they go through whilst they are lost in the woods with their ""Mama"". This is really well done, and although it doesn't paint a very complete picture, it is a really well done and used device.

The acting on behalf of the adults is ... okay. None of the actors I would call massive, that's not to say they haven't been in some good stuff, but on the whole ... I'd say it is passable. The important elements are there and Jessica Castain does carry the important role of ""the scared adult"" very well. Actually her emotional development and the character she portrays are excellent. But all the characters have this withdrawn feel (add to that the generally grey colour tones for weather and backdrop) and its clear this movie is not about the actors but the story. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is also decent, and I loved that he is in there in a double role, and very subtle in how he portrays two brothers, but given his character is away for most of the film, he isn't that important.

Direction: the way the story is combined together with the direction (i.e.: how the scenes are put together) is fantastic. Consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paranormal-Activity/dp/B003204MQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paranormal Activity</a>&nbsp;where the premise was fresh, the tension of looking for what's happening is awesome. Mama plays this very differently, you never guess if it means to show you something and there is a lot of subtlety, but also a lot of excellence in how the shots are set up. If you want a case study of how to shoot a film where the audience has a different set of information to the characters, and neither knows what is going to happen, look no further: Mama does this well. It is easily one of the tensest films and easily compares to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Splice/dp/B0041VV03A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Splice</a>&nbsp;but what it did with mostly soundtrack and setting, this one does with visuals and soundtrack. It is superb.

Soundtrack and visual design are both good. Soundtrack is arguably cliched but it works, and even though there were some instances where I considered that every work that wants to build tension uses the same technique (and it stands out) what happens next puts that thought out of my mind, and its easily forgotten again. Visual design, as mentioned above, is largely grey and dark, there will be instances where it is not and it works well on a subconscious level, again this isn't complex stuff but it works really well.

So in conclusion, I've seen a couple of reviews saying this is derivative, and yeah ... maybe it is, but this isn't something that comes up that often that you go ""oh great, another kids grow up in the wild watched over by a super natural being that can't let go when they are 'rescued' flick"". And while that is the premise there is a lot to this that makes it excellent. Basically, it knows what it is, and tries to be the best version of what that can be. However, it isn't quite what you think, and once you think back over it you'll see not only how truly sad the events were really where on the spectrum the ending falls.

Strength was the actors, who all did a good job.  It's an angry poltergeist story, similar to other popular ghost film stories of the last 30 years, nothing really new or unique; being middle age and seeing so many of these films (I like horror) after about mid-way through first act (when the girls are initially rescued), I fast forwarded to the end; something about the set up of the rescue didn't appeal to me, perhaps just cause it was two guys entering a creepy house and I've seen that so many times before.  I like horror but I don't like being startled; after viewing 3rd act, and returning to beginning of film, I found story predestrian (did I spell that right?), but not awful.

I like stories that are new and different as long as they work. If you add up all the WTH's in this story you just have to laugh at its wacked out storyline and plot holes. If I go into any detail I will spoil the movie for you and I don't want to do that to you. The story is very unique and I will give it credit for that however it is not well thought out nor is it well executed in the movie. Lets just say there is just to many unbelievable WTH moments like some of the characters, story, plot and actions taken by some of the cast. Was this worth the time to watch? Yes. Was it scary? No, but I did get a jump out of one scene that wasn't predictable out of the many many others that were predictable. The cgi was ok, but the figure was a little to cheesy for me along with the many over used body positions and stances. Was it gory? Not at all nor was it very violent or contained any sexual content. The movie does have some good production values like camera work, acting, locations and decent direction, but again the story is just to far out their unless I was watching some kind of fantasy story instead of a horror flick. 2 stars",1374796800,,1333,4.053030303030303

The kids don't rise far above the creepy kid trope in any old horror movie. The main character, the lady in the rock band, is just dumb. Her boyfriend, even though he's the children's uncle, is useless to the plot and the proceedings.

There's only one, truly scary moment, and it doesn't involve Mama or any of the main characters. It's when the uncle is in the hospital and is visited by his dead brother. It don't care if I spoiled that for you. This movie sucks. Watch something else.",1374537600,2,756,4.5588235294117645

5659763,2,B00BNH9O8I,"When a father of 2 children kills their mother, they find themselves being driven into the woods by their on edge father who is unsure of what to do about the situation. On an icy road the car swerves out of control and collides into a tree on the side of the road. The father and two daughters leave the wreck and enter a cabin in the woods (face palm) where the father explains to the kids that mommy is not coming with them. He attempts to shoot the two young girls aged around 2 and 4, but something else is in the house which stops him from killing the kids, and instead reverses his idea. The spirit known as mamma adopts the girls and we cut to 5 years later where the brother of the kids father is still in search of what ever happened to his brother and the kids? Finally they have been found, wild, weird and animalistic like. They are then taken to a hospital or psychiatric care facility or whatever before being put in the custody of their uncle and his girlfriend Joan Jett. It's not long before they begin to notice that something else has come with them, and it doesn't like the noobs.

WARNING SPOILER ALERTS: Don't read on unless you want to.

The first half of the movie is decent. However out of nowhere comes the idea that Mama is a bad entity and her history is revealed that she is a bad person. Her intention in the end is she is going to sacrifice the kids. Huh? First she rescues them, then raises them for 5 years, only to want to kill them? This protector to killer plot turn made no sense. She does not abuse them, she takes care of them, yet she is only waiting to kill them? Ok then... dumb idea... the kids become animal like and walk like their mama, like a monkey or something, yet instantly the eldest girl remembers how to walk upright and speak English... but the other one remains the same for a while, but slowly begins to return to human-like. Pick a direction already, are they f'd up, or not? They just become normal again and the youngest one they say probably won't speak just wakes her sister in the night by walking normally over to her and saying ""mama's here""? It's not a huge plot hole, but to me it would be like Hulk Hogan breaking character in the middle of a wrestling match and asking for some tea while he plays a round of crochet with the Queen. They may as well have had mama stop to look into the camera, break the 4th wall and say calmly, ""remember, this only a movie, don't be scared, look at me UN-rendered as a 3D polygon""

Then the ending. Are you kidding me? The cliff and mama is flying around all over the place? Make up your mind, is she a crawler or a flyer? It went from slightly believable to extremely laughable. And what was the point of the side story of the ghosts baby? She finds it, cries about it, euhh, bugger it, be angry. Was that needed if that's what the pay-off of that sub-story was about? They may as well have removed it all together, as it meant nothing in the movie. Then no big way to rid the ghost witch... nah, she'll do it herself and explode into butterflies. ""Yes officer, we're ok now. One kid survived, but the other, well the butterfly witch committed suicide with her so we won't be needing her bed anymore, got a number for the Good Will?""

Overall: sucks you in enough to be interesting, then blows it in the end.",1374451200,10,3313,4.253968253968254

For one thing Jessica Chastain's hair color was too distracting.. there just wasn't a purpose for it or most of the characteristics of her character. The kids were charming, the plot had promise for that of a horror flick and it simply had too many wholes in the story. The build up of the movie was greater than the movie itself.

5659772,4,B00BNH9O8I,"With the overabundance of horror films coming out, it's difficult to decide what you should or should not watch. My son, a die hard horror fan, found the recent THE PURGE a total disappointment and yet they got his ticket money. So when a truly creepy, terrifying film comes out its only natural that fans will pass the word along. Let me pass the word right now about MAMA - I loved it!

The story opens with an investment banker having a breakdown, killing his partners and his wife and then taking his daughters to a secluded house in the woods where he intends to kill them and then himself. Before he can follow through with this act he is whisked away by an unseen force and the girls are left to fend for themselves...or with the help of their unseen benefactor.

Fast forward 5 years and we come to Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the girl's uncle, who has spent what resources he has on someone searching for them. As the group is about to stop they do indeed find the girls. At a clinic where they are being watched and taken care of Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) does his best to help the girls readjust to their new surroundings. In doing so he later explains to Lucas that the girls seem to have created an unseen friend called Mama. Eventually they're able to return to their family and a battle for the girls between their aunt Jean and Lucas results in Lucas having custody.

Along with his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain), a bass player in a rock band, they are aided by the doctor. He wants to continue to treat the girls and knowing their aunt will move them across country, he provides this new family with a home to stay in owned by the clinic he works in. But his research isn't limited to the girls in the home. We witness him traveling to a different city to look into the past of someone we're unaware of yet.

At the home the girls seem a bit gun shy at first but slowly begin to open up to Lucas. This doesn't last long as some unseen entity knocks him over the railing at the top of the stairs and he ends up in the hospital. Now Annabelle, who wants nothing to do with children, is left to oversee these two. It's a slow adjustment but eventually she wins the trust of the girls and the friendship of the elder of the pair, Victoria (Megan Carpentier). An incident with the younger girl, Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) breaks down her walls as well.

But someone, or something, in the house still seems to preoccupy the girls, most notably Lilly. We get not glimpses but a full on look at just what is behind this but have no idea yet what is causing this image to appear. I won't spoil it by saying just what that is but I will offer a word of advice: if you scare easy, keep the blanket pulled close to your eyes. And if you know someone who scares easy, make sure they don't have hold of your arm for fear of an injury during one of the many scenes guaranteed to make you jump.

This film is not just a scare fest but a film filled with just the right tone to make your skin crawl at all the right moments and some of the not right moments as well. Visions of ""Mama"" are certain to become the things of nightmares for children whose parents allow them to watch this film thinking that the PG-13 rating makes it safe for them. It isn't. They will be scared. Come to think of it I might have to turn on my lights tonight before going to bed.

The behind the scenes efforts on this film are tremendous. The direction by Andres Muschietti is wonderful and he pulls some outstanding performances not just from the adult actors but from the children in particular. To think that children this young could pull off the job it takes to make this believable and to make you care is amazing and they do it with apparent ease.

The special effects seen here are also outstanding. They convey the slow moving rot that appears from time to time and then blast you out of your seat with one of the scariest visages in some time. Perhaps not enough that you'll look away but enough that it will stick with you.

Readers will know after all these years that I am a fan of horror, sometimes too much so. But this was one film that I know I'll be watching more than once and enjoying each and every time. And while I enjoy it there is one thing I know I'll do for at least the first few times around: keep the lights on.",1374019200,2,4332,4.286063569682152

5659775,3,B00BNH9O8I,"These days it seems like horror filmmakers are damned if they do and damned if they don't. The fans hate remakes but when they get original films, they refuse to support them over arbitrary reasons like ratings or a lack of blood. PG-13 or not, I made sure to get myself to the theater to see and support this and I wasn't at all disappointed. MAMA had an interesting story, impressive acting and a visually striking supernatural antagonist. There were definitely elements of Asian horror on display in this film, though MAMA relies a bit too much on CG. Thankfully the CG was animated relatively well so if you're willing to look beyond that and allow yourself to be swept up in the tension, MAMA is effective.

Sure, it won't be for everybody, and for fans of films like INSIDIOUS, SINISTER and THE CONJURING it may come off a bit lightweight but it was entertaining and, in my opinion, worth checking out. MAMA isn't amazing and just can't be considered a classic by any stretch of the word but it does the job.",1374019200,6,1014,4.540983606557377

The tension builds.  Once the children are returned to society and end up housed by an institute in what looks like everyone definition of home, they are cared for by their father's (who took the kids to the woods in the first place) brother.  Their mother's sister get visitation.  They also talk regularly to our window in, a psychiatrist, who is has a blistering need to be a parapsychiatrist.  He helps us put the story of Mama together.  This is an excellently shot film, not that greyed out thing that seems popular. The script is tight and I just love the Archivist!  She is the true heart of the film.  Buuutt...
You know there is this moment that kicks you out of a movie or a book. I hate that moment. Spoiler coming up - I have been waiting to rent the horror movie Mama since it came out in theaters (I will not pay for a pg-13 horror movie). So going along, getting wound up in the dark room, putting together the pieces of who and what Mama is. Then we see Mama and she tries to kill Annabelle. Little girl screams because the nosy Aunt has just broken into the house. Mama sinks into the floor and becomes the evil wig from hell. And there I lost it. There I'm gone. A wig squirming around the floor chasing the nosy aunt takes an otherwise scary movie and kills it. Please, if you write or direct films, never have a evil wig from hell. Unless you are Sam Raimi - he might pull it off. Everyone else - use a shadow, a stain, just not an evil wig from hell.",1373846400,2,1669,4.226415094339623

It wasn't complicated but enough for her to do what she did. Suspenseful and a Thriller. Richie Cunningham did good by his daughter too. She's a very good actor.,1372896000,,314,4.431034482758621
5659810,5,B00BNH9O8I,"I went into Mama with high expectations. I've always been a fan of pretty much anything that Guillermo Del Toro's name has been attached to, and did not think Mama would be any different. And it lived up to the quality guarantee that Del Toro set way back with The Orphanage. Mama is obviously scary at times, but it also has those emotional moments that most horror films lack.

The premise of Mama is about two girls who get abandoned in the woods after their father leaves them in a cabin there. Right off the bat, we discover that the girls didn't get left alone, as there's an entity of some sort living there with them. Five years later, the girls are found, and as these stories go, the entity moves into their new home with them.

Mama is one of those movies that starts out dark and terrifying. The two little girls, at first, are about as creepy as raised-in-the-woods-by-a-monster children can be, but as the movie progresses, they - along with the entity that accompanies them - start becoming more recognizable as human. And that's where the beauty of Mama lies - in learning about the entity and why she has become the thing that she is. She's still scary, but by the end of the film, you feel empathy for her, too.

There are also some very unique and original elements in the making of Mama as well. For example, the use of what seems to be old film footage to show scenes set in the past are used in a way I had not seen before. It helps set the tone between the past and the present and when the past melds back into the present, the effect used is something I'd never seen before. It's hard to describe (especially since I don't have a film degree), but it's very cool. And considering the present obsession with the same old tired tricks in horror films today, it's a refreshing change of pace.

Mama also boasts a pretty talented cast. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister, as most of us know him from Game of Thrones) portrays the uncle, Lucas, that is now taking care of the girls (he also plays the girls' father).  He is convincing as an artist (and possibly a little bit of a slacker) who wants nothing more than to do right by his brother's daughters.

Jessica Chastain, one of Hollywood's new ""it"" girls, is brilliant as Lucas girlfriend. Her role is much more pivotal as she becomes a new mother figure for the girl, which means she is forced to suffer the wrath of the monster. What I loved about her character is that she's still as rough around the edges (she's in a rock band, for example), up until the end of the film. She stays true to the character. There's no major ""I need to grow up and be responsible now"" moment (I hate those anyway). She  does realize that she loves the girls, but she's still true to herself.

Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nlisse portray the two children believably. And if that's them doing the creepy wild animal-like crawling on all fours at the beginning of the film, major kudos (that has to be CGI, right?). They go from being scary creatures themselves to fully realized human beings.

Mama is not a gore-fest or a jump-out-at-you scarefest. It is not a found footage film. It is one of those wonderful stories that just happens to be creepy during its telling. But it becomes even more than that and there's probably a good chance you'll need tissues before you exit the theater.",1372809600,5,3352,4.481967213114754
5659811,2,B00BNH9O8I,"What a waste.  The two child actors in this movie do a spectacular job and could really have made a great movie.  The screenplay, however, is terrible.  What ""mama"" is, is poorly designed and not explained very well.  Her motivations are....stupid.  This could have been a really great vehicle for a story about a supernatural entity that adopts two little girls and then comes into conflict when they are ""saved"".  Could have.  Unfortunately, ""mama"" is barely a one dimensional character who doesn't so much as utter anything intelligible let alone show any motivation that makes any sense.  The adult actors aren't much better.  The main protagonist ends up in a coma for no particular reason for much of the movie.  His girlfriend is borderline despicable but the writers seem not to understand this.  The doctor shows some real promise of an actual plot development, with the revelation that his interest in the case of the two girls involves some research into the supernatural he seems to be doing.  And then he dies senselessly, cutting off that plot development instead of actually going anywhere with it.  Even the special effects were crappy.  The parts where you don't see Mama are far better (due to the acting of the two child actresses) than when you actually do.  By this I mean, there are scenes where you can't see mama but the girls are interacting with her in some way.  Her presence is implied rather than seen.

All, in all....a waste of time and a waste of talent.",1372723200,2,1486,4.764705882352941

While it does have the special effects it needs to draw you to the supernatural conclusion,  it affects the heart and leaves a lasting impression, rather than bombarding the visual senses with shocking blasts, making it more believable.  And, thankfully, it was appropriate for any age level--although there is a bit of profanity in a couple of scenes, and some sexual intimacy, it was not riddled with either throughout, nor was there obvious violence or bloody scenes.

They survive, head for a nearby cabin, and as dad is ready to do the girls in someone intervenes and the girls are left on their own. Five years later the girls are found and put in the custody of their uncle Lucas and Annabel, his punk rock girlfriend. They try to bring the children back to normalcy but something is lurking in the background and putting a worm in the apple.

I liked this movie a lot. It is shot and directed nearly as well as any movie I've ever seen. Director Andres Muscietti plays one scene with a split screen using a wall in the house as a divider. Watching both sides (one with the action in the foreground, the other with the action further back) is sensational. One of the best scenes anywhere, anytime. The story moves logically and the relationship between a reluctant Annabel and the sisters develops well. It's not a Disney type transition but one that turns out of what Annabel is inside. It feels good. The unraveling of the mystery surrounding mama is pretty good. Not great maybe, but better than I've seen in similar movies. Jessica Chastain is great as Annabel. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the Lucas/Jeffrey role is Okay. He just doesn't have that much to do. The girls are outstanding. The older Victoria is remembering her previous normal life while the younger Lily has spent more time with Mama than with her previous folks. The knowing glances between the two and their behavior will creep you out.

The downside here is that Mama, and the way the girls move and behave, is too derivative of Japanese horror movies. And jump scares are considered cheap by today's horror standards. There are a couple of cheap ones here but a few others are really good because they are in tune with the way the characters are.

This is one of the better horror movies to hit the streets as of late. I like producer Guillermo Del Toro's sensibilities and he must have liked the director's shorter version of this because he put up the bucks to make it feature length. For my dollar, the investment paid off. If you're a fan of the genre, have at it.",1372291200,,2422,4.510250569476082
5659832,5,B00BNH9O8I,"This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.  Usually, horror movies are about the same; young kids in a shack in the woods, blood, guts, killing, nudity, sex.  Mama is nothing like that.  It is scary.  But the story line is one-of-a-kind.  If you like horror and being thrilled, don't miss Mama.  The two children are excellent characters, especially Lily.  She is adorable even in the beginning.  This is one of my favorites and I've lost count of how many times I've watched it!",1372291200,,500,4.477777777777778
5659833,3,B00BNH9O8I,"A young man (Nicholas Coster-Waldau), distraught at the 2008 economic collapse, guns down his ex-wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, dragging them to a deserted cabin in the woods, planning to kill them and himself in a horrendous murder/suicide. But before he can enact that horror, he is dispatched by some strange, supernatural force residing in the house. Flash-forward five years when the girls are finally discovered by the killer's twin brother and brought back to civilization, having been ""raised"" by whoever or whatever it is that resides in the place. Needless to say, the girls are a mess psychologically, but that's only half the problem that the uncle and his girlfriend (Jessica Chastain) face in trying to re-acclimate the children to life in the real world.

""Mama"" is a horror movie with a lot of elaborate bells-and-whistles but not a great deal of originality or insight. For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.

Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra. And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse are very good indeed as the haunted youngsters.",1372204800,,1660,5.099264705882353

Anyway, the movie certainly warrants more than 1 or 2 stars. I think it is entertaining. The acting was very good. The direction was nice and so was the production.

There are a lot of things you simply have to ignore in order to appreciate the movie- as is the case with a lot of supernatural/horror films. These elements include: no one can survive in the woods for 5 years, even with ""Mama""; the youngest girl was portrayed as too animalistic; the oldest girl has quite a large vocabulary; the shrink is not credible; from coma to driving (!).

The biggest problem was with the resolution. The film morphs into a ""Lifetime Movie,"" with a woman investigating dangerous occurrences on her own and trying to protect her ""daughters."" And the very end will disappoint many viewers. They tried too hard to stick with a particular theme that mimics history, and they do so unnecessarily. This is not for people who like neat and just endings.

One final thing: there were some great moments of symbolism in the film, and I especially loved the drawings of the oldest girl. Overall - entertaining, with several flaws. Just overlook them, if you can.",1371859200,4,1295,4.6960352422907485

Mama pulls out all the horror film clichs: disguised dream sequences, sudden foreground appearances, orchestral stings, and a fair amount of running.  And yet I found myself genuinely frightened and completely entertained.

The acting is excellent: Jessica Chastain is matched by the two children, and the supporting cast do fine.  In fact it's a relief to see character's in a genre that usually relies on stereotypes.

The camera work is deliberate and cleverly planned: all those clichs actually pay off in interesting ways.

The violence is almost all off-screen, and the entire movie reminded me of M Knight Shamylan's best work -- tension and terror.

Some have complained about the ending -- and it doesn't pay-off the way other sequences in the film do -- but they had me all the way there.

5659852,3,B00BNH9O8I,"This movie had a few great things going for it but not enough to really push past the bad things. I really wanted to see more of a subtle film that took time to establish the deep relationships within the characters' lives. I didn't believe most of the roles; making it hard to feel for most of the characters.

The Mama character is very neat and well-done... most of the time. There are a few moments when I stop and ask myself, ""Wait, why didn't just do it the easy way?"" I feel like the story was too short when it was trying to introduce me to characters and plots and that they took too much time with the special effects for Mama. *Spoiler* Mama is a ghost who can easily teleport through walls... Why foes she chase people?! Why did we get to see so much of her? She would have been so much more scary if we couldn't see her (fully) throughout the movie. A peek here, a peek here and our imaginations take us the rest of the way.

Now, even though Mama is a ghost you're supposed to feel passionate about, she should be more scary! Take out all the cheap jump scares and this story would be beautiful. I loved the story, especially since it's takes place near my hometown. Now, it's didn't look like Richmond or Clifton Forge, Virginia (where the story takes place), but that's not important. The backdrop ad the ghost should've worked out better, it didn't. I found myself confused because the environment was telling me things the story wasn't. If it's not important, don't waste time on it. Every shot should count and not be filler for real detail.

5659859,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Two feral children are discovered years after their father abandoned them in the woods, but they bring along an unexpected guest when they are taken in by their uncle in the supernatural thriller MAMA, from 2013. MAMA is a chilling and frightful ghost story whose most horrific moments come out of the children's eerie performances, rather than the sudden appearances of the spindly apparition. Victoria and Lilly have regressed in to an animal-like state, which causes them to run around on all fours and lash out aggressively. Their discovery within the dilapidated cabin makes for a truly unnerving experience. Director Andrs Muschietti drowns each scene with oppressive feelings of tension and dread, and creates a number of disturbing images along the way. Where he falters most is in the storytelling, itself. MAMA is a simple rehash of so many other similar tales of ghostly revenge, with a familiar structure that rarely deviates from the status quo. The film's subtler moments are infinitely more effective than the outright shocks, due to the heavy reliance on computerized imaging that dispels all feelings of suspended disbelief. If it were to be rated solely on atmosphere and mood, however, MAMA would surely top the charts.

5659872,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama has a lot of things going for it, as well as a few hindrances. Overall though it's a pretty basic ghost story with a few original flourishes here and there. One thing I especially liked about it was two feral little kids, there were some parts where I saw them moving abnormally and thought ""OH GOD WTF IS THAT!?"", all without the use of quickly amplifying the volume up to 11 for an obnoxious startling noise. The ghost design for Mama was also pretty original and disturbing looking, and there would be (few) moments with her just lingering in the background or something and it had a creeping effect. Jessica Chastain as the main chick did an above-and-beyond performance with her character, not to mention she was smokin' hot throughout the movie. I know critics praised her skeletal FBI redhead look in Zero Dark Thirty, but I sure wouldn't mind seeing her don the punk rock look for a little longer. Other things that were nice were when she finally breaks through to one of the kids, it was an unexpected scene and was a nice break from the usual horror monotony regarding Investigate/SCARE/Investigate/SCARE.

So you've probably noticed that some of these compliments are backhanded, well for all Mama's strengths it still had a few things going against it. Most notably, LOUD UNEXPECTED JUMP SCARES. I know these are pretty standard for PG-13 horror movies but... why!? It's not clever, it's not well done, it's just f***ing cheap. BOO! Startled!? That'll be $10 please. That's how I feel watching these movies and being annoyed that I have to turn down the volume when everything gets quiet. The worst part is that Mama would've been a perfectly fine horror movie without the HOLY S*** THAT'S LOUD crap; the ghost designs and story were perfectly fine enough without this cheap, lazy jump-scare B.S.

Alright I feel better, also Jamie Lannister takes a backseat for most of the movie and does occasional snooping around to investigate ghastly origins, similar to what Ned Stark did in Silent Hill. I would've been more interested to see him and Jessica take on the ghostly stuff together as a couple, instead of ""woman alone in a haunted house"" standard stuff. Also some parts in the plot didn't make much sense, most notably *spoiler* if Mama wanted to re-enact her death with the kids, why didn't she do that in the first place when it was just them in the cabin for 5 years? Ugh. This wasn't a bad movie, but it annoys me more than a straight-bad movie would because it was ridiculously close to being a great movie, and instead it's cheapened up and dumbed down to be instead ""decent"".

5659892,4,B00BNH9O8I,"It was a creepy movie.  Mama was well-drawn, and she did creep me out a few times.  She's kind of awesome.  I liked her.  She was insane, of course, but I understood her motivation for clinging to the children and trying to keep them from their uncle and his girlfriend.  They did explain (albeit obliquely) why mama looks the way she does, and it made sense to me.  I've heard others saying the CGI bothered them, but it wasn't an issue for me.  mama looked pretty real to me most of the time.  If I had been watching on a huge HDTV instead of on the computer, it might have been different.

*Mild spoilers*  The only thing about this movie that didn't seem to ring true was a dream the male character had at one point where the children's father asks him to ""Save my girls.""  I was like, ""what?  The dad was going to kill the girls.  Now his ghost is begging his brother to save them?  Maybe he changed his mind or something.""  The character of the children's father, and his ghost, didn't seem consistent to me.  Why isn't his ghost fighting just as hard for the children as Mama is?  Don't know.  But that's the only thing that didn't work for me.",1370736000,4,1151,4.274418604651163

5659894,4,B00BNH9O8I,"I'm the type who prefers a good drama or a suspenseful thriller to horror movies, due to a bad experience once.  I have a vivid imagination and I'm prone to nightmares, so I usually stay away from this genre.  However, I was in the mood for something different so I gave this one a go.  I figured a PG-13 rating rendered it fairly safe.  Let me just say that I was plesantly surprised.  The storyline is one that tugs at your heartstrings, which is rare in horror films.  The performances delivered by the two youngest members of the cast are superb, especially the older of the sisters.  If they stay with it, I foresee a bright future for these two girls.  The rest of the cast is also amazing as a family coping with the challenges that come along with taking in two feral children who had no contact with other human beings.  Some very tender moments ensue.

The unveiling of the ""Mama"" character and her true identity, and her desire to keep the girls all to herself propels the film forward.  It's interesting to discover how she came to be, seeing as how it would be almost impossible for a toddler and a pre-schooler to survive in the woods alone for five years.  Although she is the typical sinister, other-worldly being in films of this type, she wins some cool points from me for protecting the girls for so long.  However, she is also what detracts from the scariness of the film.  Although I am not a big horror fan, as previously stated, I feel that if a movie is meant to scare you, the appearance of the scary creature should at least be somewhat frightening.  We went most of the movie without seeing her face and for good reason- her movements are much more frightening.  After seeing Mama for the first time in all her glory, I was no longer unnerved.  She only became truly scary when angry, which only happened like two times.  I watched the rest of the film unaffected.  CGI is just not very scary, in my opinion.  I actually miss the days of stage makeup and the creativity and skills of a really good makeup artist.  The ""Thriller"" characters gave me the creeps as a little girl and are still quite horrific to look at even now.  Since this is a PG-13 movie, I understand the creators may not have wanted to go too far, but moviewatchers should still jump in anticipation when the music changes at the very least.  Maybe some still did, but I watched in peace knowing there was no reason to truly be afraid.

Overall, this was a really good movie with great performances by the main characters and a great storyline.  As stated by another reviewer, I too was not a fan of the ending, but I would still rewatch this movie in a heartbeat.  If you are looking for a real scare, this is not the movie for you.  If you're looking for a scary movie for the whole family to enjoy, this is a good choice.  If you prefer a good story with superb acting and a darker theme, sit back and enjoy!!",1370736000,3,2908,4.375

5659909,3,B00BNH9O8I,"I liked the (minimal) originality, plot, and the acting was great, especially by the eldest little girl.
I would've rated it 4 stars; but the ending sucked beyond belief.
I'm not looking for ""happy endings"" and all that -- Just endings that fit the story-line, while making sense... And this one didn't do either.  (which had me pondering a 2 star rating; but settled on 3)

The ghost (""Mama"") has no problem killing adults, until the end... All of a sudden, her magic killer powers are only at half strength for some reason; and despite numerous times of trying to kill the man, & ""put her (Chastain) to sleep"", fails. __ Add to this, the concept developed during the movie: ""the ghost will remain until the wrong is put right""... goes completely out the window; and the ghost does the exact same ""wrong"" -- but still ""dies"" (or whatever) and is ""at peace"".

So... Sucky, sucky ending... Which made an otherwise enjoyable movie which I would've bought, a ""straight back to NetFlix, while thanking God I'm a member & didn't pay $25 for this!"" movie.... But I digress...

Why bother putting all that content &/or back-story in the movie, if you're going to completely ignore it in the last 5 minutes!??
So not only does it not ""pay-off"" -- it ends up making absolutely NO sense... Unless of course, you're just one of those people who enjoy the pretty colors &/or scary images; and pay no attention to the plot/story/etc... Well, as evidenced by a lot of the reviews here, you'll think the ending was cool.

The originality pretty much begins and ends with the design of the ghost's look, and the reason behind it -- But I guess it was just really, really nice, not seeing the same old, non-descrip ""ghost"" & ""haunting-movie"", so hats off for at least being that original... even though the idiot, ""writer-director"", completely dropped the ball at the end -- or -- couldn't think of a better way to get to the ending he desired, so he copped-out & hoped no one would notice.

If I had 1 Dollar for every time a good movie was ruined by a horrible ending, I'd have enough money to make my own movie... which, I'd of course, ruin the ending on, in an attempt to be ironic, while allowing my own, to start my next ""1 Dollar for every time"" movie-fund.  LOL",1370476800,,2252,4.545679012345679
5659910,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Both a friend and my brother recommended ""Mama"" to me knowing how much I appreciate a good horror movie so I finally decided to watch it last night, insisting my husband watched it with me since I heard the movie had plenty of scares. The film itself has beautiful yet eerie cinematography with a muted bleak palette that reinforces the dark themes in the film. At the heart of the story are two sisters, Victoria and her younger sister Lilly who after five years of being missing are discovered in a dilapidated cabin in the woods in a remote area. The sisters are brought to live with their uncle, Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau better known for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones)and his girlfriend, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). The psychiatrist assigned to the girls' case (Victoria is about 8 and Lilly is about 5 or 6) insists that the 'family' move into a home owned by his clinic and in exchange the psychiatrist, Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) commits to supporting Lucas' claims in a custody battle with the girls' great-aunt Jean (Jane Moffat). The young girls indicate a bond with something they call ""Mama"", which Dreyfuss initially dismisses as a coping mechanism rather than anything real.

Before long, it becomes apparent that all is not well with the new family unit. The entity that had been caring for the girls at the cabin in the woods has followed the sisters to their new home and feels threatened when it perceives the girls are bonding with Lucas and Annabel, particularly Victoria, the older sibling. An attack by the malevolent entity leads to Lucas ending up in hospital, and Annabel is left to shoulder the burden of caring for the girls by herself. Gradually, over a series of interviews, Dr. Dreyfuss is able to uncover the mystery behind ""Mama"", going back in time through history to the 1800s where a tragedy unfolded involving a young, mentally unstable woman who is so consumed by rage when her baby is torn away from her.

Though not without its flaws, I found myself quite immersed in the storyline throughout the film. The main actors deliver credible performances though both Coster-Waldau and Chastain were not really able to exercise their acting talents to their full potential here, due to the limitations of the script. Chastain's performance here is actually a bit tepid, and I thought the actor portraying Victoria did a much better job emoting and conveying her dilemma and horror. The CGI effects were great and conveyed the deep sense of horror unfolding on screen.

I would recommend this movie for fans of atmospheric horror movies with jump in your seat moments!",1370476800,,2627,4.846325167037862

5659912,5,B00BNH9O8I,One word - CREEPY. I picked this one to watch with the family on Mother's Day. There were some creepy parts and some that were just okay.  It was a good rental.,1370476800,,160,4.0
5659913,3,B00BNH9O8I,"What do you get if you take a Grimm's Fairy Tale, ""The Woman in Black,"" and throw in a little bit of ""Sophie's Choice""?  Well, ""Mama"" I guess, although I believe that in this case, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.

And this is too bad, considering that this film has such a strong start.  I really liked the cinematography, I really liked the CGI, and the color palette that the director chose fit the mood perfectly.  The story seemed to have so much promise, but it just never quite came together for me, and somewhere near the beginning of the third act I started looking at my watch.  Well, that would be if I wore one, I suppose.

I thought that ""The Woman in Black"" was just a much stronger film.  Danielle Radcliffe gave perhaps his best performance there -- yes, surely better than ""Harry Potter"" although that fantasy series was good for the genre -- and I just felt that that film had a bit more believability to me.  Sure, the plots in both films require the viewer to suspend belief.  But ""Mama"" seemingly requires the viewer to take a huge leap of faith (which you might argue is somewhat fitting once you know the plot), and ultimately, I don't believe that there is enough of a payoff for that leap.

I thought that Jessica Chastain was tremendous in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Tree of Life,"" and she's almost unrecognizable here at the beginning, although that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I knew she was in the film, but I did a double and triple take trying to recognize her, as she plays a role that is so different from what I've seen her in before.  I would say that she does another fine job -- not as good as those other roles, however, although to be fair she had less to work with here -- but she's not enough to save this near miss.

Just by the numbers, I saw that the critics liked this film more than the average viewer.  On this one, I think that the critics perhaps gave it a bit of a pass.  My words are quite similar but the meaning of those words are quite different:  it's a pass by me.",1370476800,,2037,4.265625

Great acting also , I was glad to see that the story did not focused on the father at all as he did not deserved attention after what he did at all , the main focus was love for the children and the mother's love , not matter how creepy she was the love was there .. and I did not missed 1 second of this movie watching from the beginning to the end with curiosity hoping for different ending but it was unexpected and twisted .",1370131200,2,812,3.7823529411764705

One of the things I really enjoyed about it is that it's not a horror movie in the ""gore"" sense of the word. This is a supsense/thriller style supernatural horror flick. It has its fair share of ""shockers"" and ""jump from your seat"" moments. The story line is very entertaining and original (I've never seen a story along these lines).

This is by far the most liked ""horror"" movie that I have watched. The word horror is under quotation since I would not categorized this movie as horror only but under suspense, thriller, and drama. The music score and editing is awesome to say the least. FYI: read my other reviews on the movies that I have watched and you'll understand what I am trying to convey here.

So the music score and editing was great. The storyline is great and something refreshing to me unlike the overrated and hyped horror movies out there. The acting is also great and you get those feelings when you look at the actors'/actresses' eyes. The feelings that they are trying to convey. Sure there are CGI scenes and character but it just fits right in there perfectly without affecting the quality of the movie.

This movie is not purely horror but more on suspense, thriller, and drama. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The movie is especially dramatic at the end parts. It is kind of sad but at the same time makes you wonder what will happened next.

I just don't get it why this movie got a low rating of 3-3.5 Stars overall. And why people are complaining about the ending being ""crappy"" and ""bad"". This is one of the best movies out in the market right now. Well worth to purchase it either via Prime, like I did, or the physical media.

5659986,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama is a 2013 supernatural/horror film directed by Andres Muschietti.  Starring Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Mama tells the story of two young sisters left alone to fend for themselves in a small cabin in the woods.  They're found there five years later having apparently survived on only cherries and the love of a violent ghost.  Plucked and transplanted into the home of their father's twin brother, Mama follows.

I had a blast watching this film for the first eighty minutes.  It offers a solid nod to the classic ghost story and does so effectively.  I jumped in my seat a few times and I haven't had that happen in a LONG time.  It made for a fun experience and for that reason alone, I recommend at least renting the film - the bulk of it is worth a ride.

But the last twenty minutes didn't do it for me.  Dramatic and a bit cheesy, it just felt awkward and that made me sad.  The ghost started getting more screen time and the longer she flew around, the more attention was given to her facial expressions, movements.  CGI started taking over at that point and it was too much.  Not that I'd have ever been fooled into thinking they cast a real ghost for the part, but it was overwhelmingly fake and difficult to parry aside.  This, for me, rapidly depleted the suspense from Mama.  And it had such momentum!

The director seemed to take some inspirations from Japanese ghost horror and when it worked, he went yard.  But it seemed like he tried to build UP from that recipe and, in my amateur opinion, he'd have done well to keep it simple.  Everything from the black spreads on the walls with moths popping out to the hair flowing across the floors were genuinely creepy, but after that, I couldn't hang on.  Still, as I said before, most of Mama is done really well and I'm looking forward to Muschietti's future work - he's clearly talented.

As for the performance nuts and bolts of the movie, the children were cast well, Coster-Waldau was a win, and Jessica Chastain saved the day.  I think the scene movement here was clunky from scene-to-scene, rushed, and these folks did a wonderful job keeping everything glued together.  Especially Chastain.  She's worth watching here and I'll be following her career because of it.  Good stuff.

But again, I'd recommend renting this before committing to owning it.  Guillermo del Toro is the executive producer for the film, not the director, and I think the fact is notable.

Thank you for your time.

5659990,3,B00BNH9O8I,"This movie had all the ingredients of a good scary ghost  movie.  Characters that you grow to like as they evolve and are portrayed with good acting.  A wonderfully original and compelling plot that wasn't well worn yet still had the familiar ghost-story hallmarks.  Most importantly subtle escalation in the scares that mixed both psychological and jump-out-at-you-thrills.  I was not only rooting for our family but the ghost as well, in a looking forward to her redemption sort of way.  Really for most of the film I was expecting to write a four or five star review.  Unfortunately I found the ending to be not only rushed but altogether unsatisfying to the extend that I keenly felt the disappointment with the dashing of my high hopes.  Before going into any spoilers I'd say with the originality of the story and wonderful scare pacing I'd recommend giving Mama a watch.

That said, It seemed the plot was setting up for more.  With the character arc of the the new parents, the custody battle sub-plot with the other aunt, the growth of the oldest girl, what was starting with the youngest, and even what they had setup with the ghost's tail...I had just expected more.  Then they just blew it in the last few minutes for, what I'm sure was, just cheap emotional tear-reaction.  The doctor was almost useless, the other aunt/custody device didn't really go anywhere, and the ghost repeating her mortal mistakes and taking the littlest girl with her just wasn't necessary and left a sour taste in my mouth after an entire movie worth of savory enjoyment.",1369526400,,1561,4.7835820895522385

It's a scary movies but not a blood an guts scary movie so my mom in her old age is able to enjoy it as well.,1369353600,,292,3.5076923076923077
5660002,4,B00BNH9O8I,"I have to admit it, I liked ""Mama'.

In recent years, I've really gotten away from the gorier horror films that favor blood and body count over story or character or plot (with some exceptions, and this conversion is I think mostly to some of the more - and greater - Asian horror flicks I've fallen for).

Just one reason, flawed as it is, that I really enjoyed 'Mama'. Sure, it goes for the cheap jump scares, but for me most of those still worked to great effect, and I found the film more than a bit creepy at times. The performances of Jessica Chastain and the two little girls really make the film, and even with the occasionally obvious CGI - and the plot holes that the film leaves behind - I was still greatly entertained and even loved the bittersweet ending.

Kind of similar to the way I felt about 'Darkness Falls'; if you liked that one at all, you should like 'Mama'.",1369353600,,882,4.333333333333333
5660003,2,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama is a modern ghost tale that tells the story of two girls lost in the woods for five years, and are somehow taken care of by a mysterious force. From the start, the movie showed great potential. We are given a feasible situation where the girls are stranded in an abandoned home, a suitable demonstration where some new parents can step in, and a premise for a hopefully decent movie. Also, the way the girls de-evolve shortly into the movie to quadrapedal deranged social lunatics is an excellent effect and addition to the story. Very creepy.
Having said all this, I feel the movie falls a little short about half way in. Firstly, most of the scares are nothing but cheap jumps, loud noises, and eerie faces portruding from the darkness to try and make you jump in your seat. There really is not an imminent sense of danger throughout as the ghost simply plays with the girls and keeps them company. The first person harmed seems more a mishap than a malicious attempt to kill.
Secondly, the ending seemed almost silly. (Spoiler) We are submitted for our viewing pleasure to an almost reenactment of the ghost's past to where she seemingly involuntarily forced herself and her child over a cliff side, but this time with a new companion, the little girl throughout. Was this necessary for some ritual to stop the ghost from harming anyone else? I simply did not see the relevance, besides what I have just given.
Lastly, whenever someone goes by themselves into a dark house in the middle of the woods in the pitch black of night, in active pursuit of a ghost mind you, I seem to emotionally forego any caring for their death. In other words, if the person dies, I don't care because nobody would right do that in real life who wasn't suicidal or just plain stupid. This seemed to be a cheaply played scare, that did not really seem all that scary. It was more predictable than anything. Like most of the movie.
All in all, I was fairly disappointed by this movie, for the reasons listed above as well as others. I felt it to be extremely predictable and full of cheap 'make you jump' scenes and little intact horror. The ghost, while eerie and well produced, did little to make me care for her plight or backstory, other than a means of ending the movie. I would say watch this movie if you have a couple hours to burn on a rainy day with possibly nothing else to do. Maybe you'll like it, but I would definitively say that there are better horror/ ghost stories out there.",1369353600,4,2480,4.513333333333334

5660009,2,B00BNH9O8I,"When I say dark, I literally mean all the action happens in the shadows which blends in too much with the mood lighting of the movie. I rented from Amazon and watched on XBox, I had to turn the brightness up to about 60 to see anything, and it didn't help. Was annoyed through most of the movie, wondering what they saw in the shadows I couldn't see.

As far as the movie goes, falls in line with other lame-ass horror movies of late, plodding through dumb backstory and delivering cheap thrills, no climax, and absurd ending. Expected more from Jessica Chastain, she could easily have been given the Oscar for Zero Dark Thirty. She wasn't stretching much to play the lamest riot grrrl since Courtney Love stopped doing heroin the first time.

The movie is rated PG-13, even though Amazon had it listed as R.  Swearing blood and nudity wouldn't have made it any better, but at least made it more watchable.",1369180800,,906,4.54601226993865

This movie was a perfect balance because it had the quick cuts and jumps to get you gasping, but there was no gore or useless chainsaws. The story was morbid but plausible (who doesn't love a 19th century insane asylum ghost?) and the added unsettling concept of two little girls being raised in the words for five years without human contact, and how twisted that simply makes them, ghost aside, was great.

Good acting, great combination of jumping scares and a legitimately terrifying ghost in Mama; she was just my sort of horrifying: tattered shroud, distorted features, HAUNTED eyes, nightmarish voice.

5660019,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Warning! Spoiler ahead!

When my friend treated me to this movie, I thought ""My goodness!  It's going to be another bad horror movie"". It turned out I was completely wrong.

- There is some characters' depth. For example, the touching scene where one sister tried to pull the other one from their mother's hands. The question was ""Should you go with your mother to the world of the dead or stay in the living world?""

- There are some terrifying moments too.  For example, the scene at the beginning, in the abandoned house did scare me.

- The acting is good enough to be convincing and enjoyable.

- The plot is not too illogical as others of its kind.

- According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production budget was $15 million.
Its domestic gross was $71,628,180. Its foreign gross was $73,200,000. So, the worldwide gross was $144,828,180. Its profit was 9 times more than its cost! That's a huge amount. It's popular both in North America and overseas.

I'm always so disapointed when you spend the movie being creeped out and then they blow it with what the thing actually looks like later on.

There were a few things that kept me from giving this the full five stars, however. The little girls were great, especially the younger one who was totally convincing as a sort of feral child. The uncle who searched for them and ultimately tried to adopt them was either a bad cast or the character was really poorly developed. Whatever the case, it seemed like he was just taking up space; interesting departure for Jessica Chastain as the goth girlfriend. Additionally, I found it difficult to follow much of the action because the movie was so dark--not just the story line (which is VERY dark) but dark as in hard to see. I realize this was done to set a particular mood but it was extraordinarily hard to make out much of what was happening.

Here it comes: It was different, but pretty good up until the end. And, I can appreciate CGI, but only in moderation. That's all. I just know that if someone tells me a movie has a bad ending, I won't watch it.

Well, I thought I heard that someone who contributed to Pans Labyrinth had something to do with this film, which disappointed me a little but I decided to watch it anyway. Granted, there were a couple of good jumps. I love horror films but by the time I was about 20 minutes into it, I was wishing I hadn't decided to watch it alone. My dog moaned at one point, and I peed a little.

I think they hit ""their"" mark with Mama's character, but not mine. Don't get me wrong, broad was creepy as dookie! But she was also ugly as sin, even pre-grudge. Though, that perfectly depicted the realistic nature of parent/child relationships. Your mother's the most beautiful woman in the world to you. There was one point where I thought they were working too hard to make her ugly...I seriously don't understand why so feel free to explain.

But the trying too hard part...that is why I did not like Pans Laybrinth. I felt they tried to make me feel something. Physically, I'm a woman, but emotionally, I'm a dude. There was a twinge of something, but I'm old and childless and pmsing so...

I can't say it was a bad movie. It was full, interesting, suspenseful at times... There was just something not quite right toward the 2/3 mark, and then the ending ruined the whole damn thing. But the crappy ending doesn't stick with you very long. It's been about 10 mins since it ended and I'm over it now.

If you liked The Ring and The Grudge, you will like this. In all fairness, this movie takes the genre up several notches because the outdoor shots are gorgeous. The indoor shots can sometimes be too dark, and it gives one (me at least) a slight feeling of being cheated. But then the darkness is part of the story.

If you are on anti-depressants, eat a fistful before watching. I admit there were three points at which I was moved to tears. I won't spoil it for those about to watch. You will know the points when they occur. If you have kids, you will recognize the tearjerker scenes all too well.

Even now, thinking about those scenes really makes me uncomfortable.

For overall emotional impact, this really is a five-star effort. The 1s and 2s are most likely from folks who think REAL HORROR is Halloween or Friday the 13th. The psychological fear and apprehension generated by many of the scenes in this movie far outweigh the gruesome scenes of teens being impaled on various farming implements --without the gruesomeness. It is free of any gore, although, again, some scenes can be disturbing.

Mama is horrifying to behold , full of anger and intense sorrow , but as the story unfolded I could help but feel for ""mama"". I felt the character of Mama was full of pathos, thus much more than some common generic slasher ghoul that's offered up in 95 percent of so called horror movies of our time.

There really isn't much more worth saying about it. The VFX are hit and miss. The performances are ok, but not crafted well enough to make up for the mediocrity of the story telling.

I just had to give this movie 5 stars.  Why?  Good understandable plot, well thought out with enough scarey twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  The 2 little girls are incredible little actors and completely believable.  All characters gave great performances. To me there were no villians, but how can you make a movie without a bad guy. And so the ghost is made ugly and scarey and murderous.  If you think about the characters, their stories are truly heart-breaking.

OK - A woman in an institution a lifetime or more ago, snatches/grabs her infant child from the nurse and makes a break for it.  She is chased by big angry men thru the woods to the edge of a cliff.  Her choice; let the men take her back to the institution and never see her child again or jump to her and her childs death.  She jumps.  Move forward to today.  A distraught father takes his 2 small daughters, one is little more than a baby, in his car from their home to somewhere up in the mountains. He is speeding down an icey road in a snowstorm. He is driving like a madman.  The girls are frightened and crying.  The oldest girl begs him to slow down.  The car skids, goes over an embankment and crashes into a tree.  He grabs the girls, dragging them thru the woods and finds an old abandoned cabin.  He is obviously crazy with grief.  Crying and distraught, he holds his one child and puts a gun to her head.  In the next moment he is savagely attacked by ??? the ghost?  Next you see the two little girls sitting on the floor of the cabin.  They are alone.  Who will ever find them.  How will they survive without heat, clothing, water, utilities and food, especially in the long cold winter.  Out of the darkness, rolling across the dusty floor comes a cherry.  It's a cherry the smallest girl exclaims.  -Go forward several years-  The girls Uncle had never given up hope of finding the girls.  He has spent all his money and has frustated his girlfriend in his obsession to find them.  Just has he has spent his last penny the girls are found.  They are little more than wild animals, but they are alive.  How could this be?  In the center of the cabin's main room is a waist high pile of cherry pits.  OK, a little far fetched, but stick with me on this one.  The Uncle is thrilled they are found and decides to take them to live with him.  The girlfriend is a free spirit (plays in a band tattoos and all) and is not thrilled with this.  And little do they know, but with the girls comes the ghost.  The grieving mother who jumped to her death.  Her body was found, but never the child's.  She had been searching for her child all those years when the distraught father came to the cabin in that area.  When she heard the children crying and pleading and saw that the children were in mortal danger, she stepped in and saved them.  She cared for them, played with them, fed them and protected them.  You come to understand that her love for the two girls replaced the love and loss of her child she had been searching for for so long.  But now others have taken these children from her too.  How the rest plays out will keep you guessing.  You fear for the children.  The adults at first have no clue.  When they each do get a clue, the ghost steps in. You never know what is coming next. The children are torn between the real world and the love of ""Mama"".  When you believe all hope is lost. The hero in the movie is the least likely.  It is a bitter/sad battle to the very end.  And just when you believe it IS the end, IT ISN'T!

5660105,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Visually stunning looking, ""Mama"" is a pretty good thriller but would have made a much more effective horror movie if it had been rated ""R"" giving the director free reign to make a scarier horror film. Under the guidence of Guillermo Del Toro

The fact is that although ""Mama"" was sold as a horror film, it's more of a thriller with lots of jump scares and atmosphere to spare. What works in ""Mama"" works well-- Jessica Chastian and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau both give exceptional performances with Chastian doing an outstanding job in a very different role for her to date.

Equally notable are the children ( Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nlisse) acting in the film who give very natural performances that help ""sell"" the film. ""Mama"" manages to transcend the predictability that creeps into the second half of the film much like the creature of the title of the film.

Writer/director Andrs Muschietti does a good job on his first feature film which shows a strong influence of Guillermo Del Toro who produced the film.

SPOILERS:

Two little girls are stranded after their father (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in a dual role) kills their mother and goes on the run. The girls are left in a deserted cabin in the middle of winter where they are cared for by a dark creature they refer to as ""Mama"".

Five years past and when their uncle (Coster-Waldau)discovers their whereabouts, he is determined that he and his girlfriend (Chastian)will adopt the two girls. Both, however, became feral while on their own and when they move into a new home (observed by a psychatrist), they bring something back with them.

END OF SPOILERS:

The blu-ray transfer looks quite nice with rich, deep blacks and terrific detail. The audio mix is also exceptionally good.

The special features include a commentary track by Andrs Muschietti and his sister co-writer/producer Barbara Muschietti. It's a decent commentary track although the pair often describe the scene we're watching.

We also get the very effective five minute short that caught co-producer Del Toro's eye (he also provides an introduction)and is echoed with a different outcome in the feature.

We also get a 10 minute featurette on the production of the film ""The Birth of Mama"" as well as Matriarchal Secrets: The Visual Effects of Mama a short (six minutes)featurette on the visual effects.

We also get eight deleted scenes with an optional commentary track.

We also get a DVD as well as an Ultraviolet streaming or itunes download (""from select retailers"" not sure what that means but it's mentioned on the box).

""Mama"" starts off promising and is an enjoyable ride but becomes predictable by the last half of the film.  Still, ""Mama"" IS worth watching and suggests considerable promise for the Mushietti team.

5660119,2,B00BNH9O8I,"This movie follows the same premise that most seem to follow. The story itself had huge potential but the writing was awful. Jessica Chastains portrayal of a ""rocker girl"" was plain old laughable and it was obvious that she was playing dress up. I spent the entire movie with my volume remote in hand because of the thousand or so instances where an ""Orchestra hit"" or loud noise would attempt to ""scare"". The CGI was atrocious and I think the animators mistakenly thought that they did a good enough job as to where we could look at the computer generated ""Mama"" for several minutes and not cry foul. Being a Northern Virginia native I noticed quite a few references. Look up ""Bunny Man Bridge"" and draw the parallel.",1368144000,,718,4.6171875

But what happens when that natural, pure, loving instinct is thwarted?  That twisted answer is at the heart of this frightening movie.  Scary movies are my 'thing,' and it's so rare to find a truly ingenious one that can capture my attention...and hold it.  ""Mama"" is such a movie.  I was captivated from the first scene to the ending credits.  This movie is destined to become a horror classic.",1368144000,2,650,4.591304347826087
5660121,3,B00BNH9O8I,"The characters are very obnoxious and hard to care about, esp. the ""rocker"" girlfriend. The scares are mostly the jump type, accompanied by loud bursts of music instead of genuine terror. Another problem is the CGI...it kills any suspense or scares because it just looks fake. I wish the movie business would back off on CGI and use it just to enhance things (if they MUST) because it NEVER looks real (Check out Slither if you want to see a current (ish) film with practical effects (its a blast of a film too, very fun)). Near the end I actually laughed at some of the reveal ""scares"". CGI is at its worst trying to make a humanoid. Why, why, why, would a human ghost need to be all CGI? They should have cast an actor for the part, done conventional make up efx, and added CGI for small details. It would have looked real. The CGI ruined the movie for me.

Del Toro does not direct this movie and it is no where near the quality of his films. It is almost unfair to the real director to paste Del Toro's name on the film because you immediately expect a very high quality film and are let down. If he had released it without his name on it I probably would have not been so disappointed. If you want to see one of his ghost films, check out The Orphanage, or the Devils Backbone (that one is terrifying and pure Del Toro). They have some genuine scares in them.

Mama is adequate but not exceptional. Watch it for free if you can, or rent it if you are desperate/curious, but do not buy it.",1368144000,4,1493,4.253521126760563

5660126,4,B00BNH9O8I,"You probably already know how mixed the reviews have been for the oddly named ""Mama"". However, like most movie addicts although I love reading reviews they never dictate to me whether to see or not see a film that's caught my interest.

As a marketing ploy, instead of a tag line or knock out review - the movie poster itself as well as all advertising for ""Mama"" features the huge message "" From The Creator Of Pans Labyrinth""

Key word ""Creator"" not director. So of course it would be a mistake going in to expect the sheer brilliance of the modern day classic Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro. That said as he served as executive producer, Director Andre' Muschietti paints his own style with excellent production values and a definitive ""creepiness"" that makes ""Mama"" stand out visually as an American Gothic style ghost story.

You won't find a ""Horror"" movie here, not in the sense of scaring your socks off. The script albeit fractured via hard to connect time frames - still delivers both excellent performances and genuine chills.

Is the film flawed? definitely but then few aren't.

""Mama"" has a unique look, superb production values and authentic and at times deeply disturbing images. Jessica Chastain is stellar as the lead character ""Annabel"" and the children, those two little girls are quite exceptional for ones so young.

Frightening in the beginning, they steal your heart an we root for them, the effects be they automations or CGI are used sparingly and well - these moments, glimmer with an eerie and chilling suspense and the few true scares Mama delivers are impressive.

Violence and bloodshed are less than minimal - hence the PG-13 rating, but make no mistake this is a film for adults. And not to give anything away, but the ending, that final scene does indeed make up for when the film drags or is fractured along the way to it's final destination - and that's good movie making.

5660134,4,B00BNH9O8I,"I'm conflicted on MAMA.  There are things that I really like about this movie, but there are things I really can't stand about it too.

Let's get the bad out of the way first.  The CGI on Mama was awful.  What should have been something really scary was just ugly (and not in a good way).  The ghost was overly CGIed, and looked pretty horrid in my opinion.

However the good far outweighs the bad on this film.  The script is above average for these types of movies.  Sure there are cliched moments, but the story and characters are well written.  Even with a good script the movie could still fall apart without the right actors, and here Jessica Chastain, Megan Charpentier, and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse do a remarkable job.  This is really some of the best acting I've seen in a horror movie in quite a long time.  As Jeffrey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is amazing as a man who is at the end of his rope.  The opening scene is really held together by some fantastic directing and Nikolaj's fantastic performance.  Nikolaj's other role as Jeffrey's twin brother Lucas kind of falls into cliched territory in terms of story content (he leaves the girls alone for a good portion of the second half of the film), and it doesn't seem like he was given much to do, but his acting in the opening is quite good.

As for the blu-ray itself it has some really good extras (which is why I gave the disc 4 stars and not 3).  My favorite is the inclusion of the original MAMA short.",1368057600,3,1467,4.4216417910447765
5660135,5,B00BNH9O8I,"This is a great horror film especially for being only PG rated. There is almost no blood (save a few spots on a collar early on there is none), but this is a ghost story not a gore fest. This movie is designed to creep you out not gross you out. The ghost is extremely well designed (a real actor not a goofy CG project) and the story really pulls the viewer out of their comfort zone. You can feel the anxiety in the characters and what they are dealing with. This film will have to you talking to the TV - you will get involved with the characters and emotionally attached.

Yes the ending is not what you expect to happen but it makes sense and completes the story, this is not left open for a part two.

So sit back, turn off the lights, and turn up the volume. You will enjoy this one.

MAMA finds a barely recognizable Jessica as a Joan Jett lookalike who has requisite tattoos and plays bass in a rock band.  While not an Oscar-worthy performance, Chastain does inhabit the role of Annabel effectively, going from the self-centered girlfriend to a caring guardian.  Game of Thrones' Nickolaj Coster Wakau plays both brothers involved with the ghostly goings-on exuding a staunch sensitive male presence.  Megan Charpentier as Victoria and Ilise Nielisse (sp?) as Lily are amazingly good in their demanding roles.

I got my hands on the Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy+UltraViolet copy - don't bother asking me for the `inside code' - I already gave that away to my co-host Jennyfly of JennyflyBlog.com (lol)

So lets talk about the movie - I do find it funny that Jessica Chastian's name is right above the title of the film. (lol) Oscar's baby. (lol) Ya know...ZERO DARK THIRTY. But to be honest - I found her the hottest in LAWLESS...either way...she's dope. Guillermo Del Toro presents the film - so if you're a fan of him, PAN'S LABRINTH and HELL BOY...you should already get this movie. MAMA definitely has the Guillermo `feel.' The cast in the film - I thought was on point. Jessica Chastain as the rocker girlfriend is cool - Boyfriend/Uncle to these  two little girl's played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) - he does great AND...I can't forget about these two adorable little girl's - - - my little TARZAN kids!! These two were just awesome...especially the littlest one named Lilly....with all her little growls and eating on the floor with the family pet. HILARIOUS. Now lets about the special effects - I liked them. MAMA was believable and she didn't play! (lol) I'd suggest turning off all the lights when you watch this. (lol)

My little Blu-Ray+DVD+Digital Copy+UltraViolet copy contains some cool stuff. Deleted scenes, Original Short with Introduction by Guillermo del Toro, The Birth of Mama and more. Make sure you read the back if you decide to buy it...the Blu-ray contains an exclusive.

I give MAMA... 4 out of 5 popcorns. Even though a lot of people told me...""Mike, you're going to like...but the ending totally sucks."" I didn't agree. I thought the ending did the movie justice. I was happy and that's why I say MAMA is worth adding to your movie collection.

Though it seemed a bit slow in the begining, I was actually impressed that they did a great job of bringing the main characters to life. When it is all over every minute they used in the begining for character development was important.  Early on I was concerned that the female lead was poorly chosen, that she didn't represent the type of woman that the male lead would have been interesed in.  However, 20 minutes into the movie and that concern was gone.  The acting from the little girls and up was all spot on.  The two girls were impressive for their age but I think the youngest girl was perfect in this role and by then end of this movie I was invested in ALL of the main characters including the spirit.  This movie was enjoyable to watch they was no sex, nudity or even foul language.  All in all one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time and I would gladly reccomend it to my friends and family.

5660146,4,B00BNH9O8I,"The first time I watched ""Mama,"" I walked away disappointed. For some reason, the special effects looked extremely artificial to me. That was my only real complaint, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film.

As I was getting ready to write my review, I had this nagging feeling I needed to watch ""Mama"" again. Rarely do I watch a movie twice in such a short period of time, but I was drawn to give it another chance. I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that I did.

Two little girls stumble upon a cabin after a car wreck. Five years after their disappearance, they're found and taken into custody by their uncle Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel. The two bring the children into their home and attempt to give them a normal life. As bizarre circumstances unfold, Annabel starts to get the feeling something sinister has accompanied the girls and is ""protecting"" them.

For the most part, director / writer Andrs Muschietti adheres to the saying ""less is more."" We get quick and creepy glimpses of the supernatural entity. As the movie moves along, we are given longer and greater detailed glances at her. What looked very CGI the first time I took it in proved to be more convincing and practical at second look.

I found ""Mama"" full of great moments of genuine thrills and chills upon giving it a second chance. You'd think a horror movie you've seen before wouldn't hold as much tension when watching it again, but that's not the case with ""Mama."" It had more of an effect on me the second time around.

Every actor in the movie is convincing in their role. Jessica Chastain transforms from a 1960s blond southern belle into a black-haired punk rocker incredibly well. The girls are absolutely phenomenal and their authentic reactions to the events occurring to them are noteworthy.

The audio and video for ""Mama"" will please consumers. A lot of the film is obviously in the dark. This doesn't hinder the viewer from seeing everything they're supposed to. The picture is clean and clear although it has a bleak color palette splashed with autumn tones every once in a while. The 5.1 surround sound will have you jumping out of your seat at every bang, sudden musical burst, and groan seeping out of the speakers.

There's a good amount of bonus material provided for the Blu-ray release of ""Mama."" Director / Co-writer Andrs Muschietti and Producer / Co-writer Barbara Muschietti contribute feature commentary. The original short film is featured with an introduction by Guillermo del Toro. Two featurettes entitled ""Matriarchal Secrets: The Visual Effects of 'Mama'"" and ""The Birth of 'Mama'"" are found. Deleted scenes are included as well.

""Mama"" isn't going to satisfy gore hounds with its ""less is more"" approach and lack of gore. However, gothic horror enthusiasts and those who love a good ghost story with substance will thoroughly enjoy this.

I dislike horror movies because they give me nightmares, I become afraid of the dark and because of the scenes that just jump out and spook me. First, and foremost, horror movies give me terrible nightmares. After watching a horror movie, I don't even want to go to bed because I know what I will have coming my way. As soon as I fall asleep, I start having nightmares. I can feel someone or something just staring down at me wanting to sink their untrimmed nails into my face. Also after watching a movie I tend to be afraid of the dark. I can see a long bony hand rich out from the darkness and take my covers from me and just reaching over grabbing me and pulling me in with it. It's a horrible sensation. Another thing that scares me about these movies is the scenes that just pop up and spoke you. These are reasons why I dislike watching scary movies.

So it is a mixed bag to review, because I could have given everything from one to five stars. First: I don't understand (like I didn't back in the day when ""Don't be afraid of the dark"" came out)why a guy like del Toro as an exec. producer always let the directors give away the look of the monster or mosnters at the first possible moment. Especially in Mama it would have served the movie well, if you would have seen a lot less of the entity of it's titel, which would have hightened the suspens and terror a lot. Second: What kind of ending was this??? There where two or three possible endnings hidden in the subplots, but neither was chosen to give the film a decent ending, but maybe that's the problem if you have 5 guys writing a screenplay that at the end no one knows anymore how to bring the movie to a satisfying conclusion for the audience.

Everything about it rules, and no worries about how it wasn't directed by Guillermo del Toro...anybody who is a fan of his films will definitely appreciate it.  Excellent characters and story line, and I will be watching this one again and again.  Check it out, way better than most of the other horror films around these days :)",1367280000,,372,4.6923076923076925
5660162,4,B00BNH9O8I,"What caught my attention about Mama was Del Toro's name. I find that anything he touches is dripping with atmosphere and style, and Mama is no exception. While Del Toro did not direct, he produced and evidently had a hand in creating Mama's atmosphere and characters. The film is dripping with his whimsically dark style and spooky but never ultra-violent imagery. It does carry a PG-13 rating which may turn away some horror movie regulars, and I am more than guilty of dismissing many potentially good horror movies simply because they're not rated R. But because I have been pleased with all of Del Toro's productions, in particular ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", and ""Pan's Labyrinth"", I decided to give Mama's teen-friendly proposal a chance. Overall, I thought Mama was fantastic! Sometimes blood and guts get old and I'm rather tired of all the slop that's been released lately. What Mama does so well is it frightens and tells its story without needing hardcore gore and mature themes. Most importantly though, it doesn't make you wish it had those things because it engages you in the likable characters and interesting story first and foremost. There are some genuinely creepy moments in the film. Mama also does something remarkable for a modern horror movie: it doesn't assume you will settle for stupid jump scares or ghost in the mirror crap or brain-dead characters. When Mama scares, it lets you know it's coming, and then allows you to enjoy what it has to offer, rather than force you to cling to your chair until something jumps out and makes you scream, only to have you curse it for its predictability. The only thing I have to complain about is the use of CGI. I am old-school in that I find make-up and mechanical effects much more believable because they fit into a film and don't stick out like they're not supposed to be there. Mama has CGI, and while it is not overdone, and certainly is not bad, it sticks out against the non-CGI scenery and characters at times, taking from the otherwise wonderfully creepy atmosphere. Overall, Mama is a great film for those of you horror fans willing to take the PG-13 plunge.",1367193600,2,2140,4.7399463806970505
5660163,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama brings us the tale of two kids lost in the woods who are raised by an unknown entity for five years before being returned to their family, much to the disapproval of the supernatural surrogate mother. The opening act is atmospheric and creepy and doesn't give away too much about what to expect and certainly the little girls are disturbing enough to stay off my Christmas list. There are some of Guillermo Del Toro's trademark fantasy elements and initially at least the camera moves are subtle enough to bring some well-executed scares early on.

Plot-wise, it starts to go off the deep end almost immediately the girls are rescued. The psychological evaluation part of the film doesn't really go anywhere and the seemingly obligatory Internet Research Scene was a really lazy way to spoon-feed the audience exposition about what's going on. The new parents, played ably by Jessica Chastain and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, start to act like their common sense glands have been removed and seem to ignore the growing supernatural signs that it's time to get out of the house and head to Disneyland. Even the characterization of the two leads at the beginning of the film is completely forgotten by the midpoint.

Unfortunately, as with almost every horror I've seen in the last couple of years, the overuse of CGI kills the scares completely and rehashes so many of the effects from previous films. From the ""Dark Water"" rotting wall scene to the fast-moving ramping effect of the monster, we've seen it all before. And it's a shame they painted over Javier Botet's weird, lanky performance as Mama (search for ""Javier Botet mama movement test"" on YouTube) - the more we see her as CG, the funnier it gets. The finale is one of the weakest 10 minutes I have seen in a long time and I felt almost embarrassed for the actors trying to get through how bad it was.

Mama is like a worse version of The Woman In Black. Though it's more atmospheric and skilled than Sinister, it's a wasted opportunity for what starts as a strong concept and ultimately steps through the motions to reach a conclusion that most of the audience won't care about.",1367193600,3,2139,4.7601078167115904

There are a couple of jump scares but not nearly enough, and the big finale is almost laughable - with all the money at their disposal, they couldn't have made Mama more interesting looking?

5660168,4,B00BNH9O8I,"And yes, it is a ghost story. Anyone who has been disappointed by recent entries in the genre that turned out to be psychological thrillers instead: here's your movie. Mama starts with the setup: a man (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who lost his shirt when the stock market crashed goes on a tear and leaves the scene of the crime with his two very young daughters in tow. I don't think I'm spoiling too much to say that he doesn't get very far before meeting a sticky end, but his daughters survive and over the ensuing five years go feral in a forgotten cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, their father's twin brother Luke (also Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has never stopped looking for them. When they are finally discovered he wants a prominent place in their lives. So does his former sister-in-law, a chilly blonde who sues to win custody and will likely win due to the fact that she is more successful financially than he is. The psychiatrist who has been treating the girls does not want to lose access to them and knows their aunt will take them across the country and out of his reach, so he makes a deal with Luke: he will set Luke and his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) up in the suburbs in exchange for his influencing the outcome of the custody trial. Annabelle is a bassist in a punk rock band and emphatically not interested in motherhood, but she loves Luke so she goes along with the plan. What almost nobody realizes is that the girls were not really alone in the forest, and they are not the only new guests in Luke and Annabelle's new home either. The main suspense is in finding out who or what Mama really is, but there is an added frisson when the viewer realizes (minor spoiler ahead) that the good doctor might know more than he initially let on as well. And there's a humdinger of an emotional wallop as the girls realize that they have to choose because they can't have both Mama and Annabelle in their lives. Mama won't allow it. The special effects are very well done and the acting is well above average for a horror flick. If you like ghost stories check it out.",1367020800,5,2086,4.492105263157895

5660170,4,B00BNH9O8I,"Before I purchased this movie, I read a number of critic reviews and found them to be extremely mixed. Many critics liked the film; many disliked it. All called it derivative.

I can't say I agree. I really enjoyed this little creeper of a film! It may not be the best horror film in the whole wild world, but it certainly scared the crap out of me and my girlfriend. That's not bad for a PG-13 movie!

The story goes that a father goes on a murderous rampage, then kills his estranged wife and naps his two daughters. He drives off at crazy speeds and spins off the road. Surviving the accident, he wanders with his daughters through a cold, isolated woods until he discovers a seemingly unused cabin.

Flash forward five years. The kids' uncle has been looking for them all these years, and his investigators find them still living in the cabin; daddy is nowhere to be found. How the heck did those two little feral girls survive all that time on their own?

Or WERE they on their own?

This movie wasn't exactly subtle. It wasn't as if I couldn't foresee many of the plot twists, but it still scared the snot out of me. No tiny feat that!

Mama is not a film i would consider ""Scary"" , but be mindful that, Mama does have its moments. I really admired and appreciated the pace of this film because so often horror films are really fast paced, that sometimes you can miss a key element or important plot point of the film. At 100 minutes I was expecting a quick,predictable movie. I am glad to say that is not the case with Mama. This is one of those RARE films that second after second, I was anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. And THAT my friends, is a good thing. Jessica Chastain (being one of the better known stars of this movie) did a really great job as Annabel and the two young girls in the film, Lily and Victoria (Not known what their real names are) are absolutely splendid in Mama. The remaining supporting cast all did exceptionally well. And The Direction of this film is one of the best I have seen in quite awhile.

5660181,3,B00BNH9O8I,"Mama offers the expected horror clichs, but remains notable for it's clever choice of camera angles, adequate jump scenes, and thanks to the acting the narrative is (to an extent) believable.

The film jumps straight into the plot, not wasting time on a lengthy introduction.

However the pace and tension within the film could have been more tightly knitted together, by disposing of some needless scenes that reveal minor details to the storyline.

The CGI works well in the beginning as we see snippets and quick flashes of the unknown presence, but then the ghost is revealed too early in the film. This however would be fine if the source of the fear was something to behold in terror and could remain so after the reveal, but if we don't 'believe' in it, it has lost it's direction and our attention.
However, the overall setting and shots in the film, combined with good acting, allows for an enjoyable horror, just don't take it too seriously. Enjoy and embrace Mama for its clich's and obvious build-ups.

Conventions are after all created because they work within their genre, and this film is no exception.

Throw in a little Nell-flavor, with two young girls (1y/o & 3y/o) discovered five years after being abandoned in a woodland cottage, and the result produces two primitive little girls who shuffle around on all fours like animals and appear to survive primarily on cherries.

What I did appreciate about Mama is the display.  Not only are the scenes and sets spooky, but the actual Mama character is exposed early enough into the film to conjure image when floor boards creak.  Even if she did sort of look like a CG version of the central character from Munch's ""Scream.""  Adding a heaping does of uneasiness are the two little girls themselves.  Neither will be invited to neighborhood birthday parties any time soon.  The casting is done pretty well, and all actors held their screentime powerfully.  Ultimately, however, there is nearly nothing new, and the ending is as predictable as the Farmer's Almanac.  What isn't completely predictable is the ending.  Yeah, about that.  It's a horribly mixed message leaving the ending easily the worst part of the film.  Regardless of how it's examined, Mama makes a decision that leaves viewers unsatisfied.  Finishing either with a positive or negative spin is fine; it's all director flavor, but going ""half-way"" is just palatable.

After murdering his wife and business partner, a distraught man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) escapes to a cabin in the woods with his two very young daughters. He plans to kill them and then himself, but something destroys him before he has a chance.

Five years later, the girls are found -- feral and naked, except for wreaths of flowers. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau again) immediately volunteers to care for them, although his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) is a little more reluctant. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) supports their custody claim and even gives them a McMansion to live in, as long as he has access to the girls.

But something strange is afoot -- nightmares, moths and tales of someone the girls call ""Mama."" After Lucas takes a near-fatal fall down the stairs, both Annabel and Dreyfuss begin to suspect that ""Mama"" is not just a coping mechanism, but something that spent years raising the girls in the woods. And she won't let anyone else take care of ""her"" children.

It really annoys me when people insist that ""PG-13 horror always sucks!"" -- if it's done with atmosphere and skill, it doesn't need an R-rating or a big budget. ""Mama"" doesn't have a lot of jump scares or grotesque images -- it relies instead on a creeping sense of unease, draped in shadows, fluttering moths, dead leaves and sepia-toned decay.

Andres Muschietti has never directed a full-length movie before, but frankly I'm dying to see what he comes up with next. He already has a lot of skill, such as the beautiful scene where we first glimpse Mama in the house -- a single shot of Lily playing with someone, as Victoria and Annabel drift in and out of other rooms. It's a quiet, unmoving shot, but we're left with the growing horror of knowing that SOMETHING unknown is in that room with a little child.

And the horror really amps up when we finally DO see Mama. She's a twisted, shadowy creature with scuttling limbs and windblown hair, but she also elicits our pity for her madness and sorrow. She's a classic ghost, and every attack makes perfect sense.

It also has some truly excellent acting from, well, EVERYONE. Coster-Waldau is absolutely heartbreaking as a man desperately devoted to his family, and willing to give up everything for his brother's children. Chastain also gives an excellent performance as Annabel, slowly warming up to the children as she slowly becomes aware that something supernatural is creeping into her new suburban life. The one problem: her transition from ""rock chick who doesn't want kids"" to ""loving aunt"" never feels quite natural.

And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nlisse... wow. Both of them are absolutely brilliant, which is all the more impressive because they're so young. They give beautifully nuanced performances, especially since they have to act like feral children for awhile. Wow. Like the director, watch these children.

""Mama"" is the kind of horror movie that deserves to be a classic -- a dark, twisting story that relies entirely on the most classic kind of ghost there is. Definitely a must-see, even for people who aren't a big fan of horror.",1362355200,19,3697,4.853968253968254
5660193,4,B00BNH9O8I,"The CGI-generated entity, ""Mama,"" provides a decent scare, or at least startling, most of the time.  But it's the creepiness and freakiness of the little girls -- deserted in a cabin in the woods for years when one was pre-k age and the other just a baby -- that give this movie its edge.  Aside from that aspect of the plot, all that's really important, and is made clear from the onset, is that Jessica Chastain's character is not kid-friendly; she doesn't want kids nor is her lifestyle conducive to mothering.  Yet because she loves her boyfriend, she agrees to help him care for his two nieces, who are definitely not like other little girls, and were for years raised by a ""mother"" with a back story that's led to some serious attachment issues.  In terms of the girls' birth parents -- their father killed their mother and it's his fault that they ended up in that cabin.  These kids could definitely use some nurturing.

Much like in a good number of horror movies, some of what happens doesn't makes sense, or remains unexplained because there's no good explanation.  Or is so painfully obvious that you keep expecting a twist that never comes.  But what redeems this particular horror movie from all of that is 1) how absolutely freaky it is at times, and 2) its fairly nuanced commentary on family and parenting.

I saw the movie in a theatre and am not sure how well the special effects will play out on a small screen, and it is pretty reliant on them for scares.  Still, although it's not on par with ""The Ring"" (another movie that explores both the dark and virtuous side of parent/child relationships and is populated by a horrifying little girl), ""Mama"" gets points for trying to update some pretty tired conventions of the genre -- and because those little girls are just so freaky.  Kudos to the child actors for doing such a great job.",1361836800,3,1855,4.590909090909091
5660194,5,B00BNH9O8I,"""Mama"" is great! This is how the story goes: Five years ago, sisters Victoria and Lilly vanished from their suburban neighborhood without a trace. Since then, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home. As Annabel tries to introduce the children to a normal life, she grows convinced of an evil presence in their house. Are the sisters experiencing traumatic stress, or is a ghost coming to visit them? How did the broken girls survive those years all alone? As she answers these disturbing questions, the new mother will find that the whispers she hears at bedtime are coming from the lips of a deadly presence.

This is a great horror movie that is different and entertaining. It is also a well-made and well-crafted chiller, as well. Jessica Chastain is great and nearly unrecognizable as Annabel.

5660195,1,B00BNH9O8I,"I was so excited to see this movie...very disappointing!  The ""good"" parts are what you see in the ads on tv, the ending is by far the worst ending I have ever seen. There was one, maybe two scenes in the movie that were actually scary.  Overall it was just a very predictable and lame movie experience.",1361232000,12,303,4.298245614035087
5660196,2,B00BNH9O8I,"Kids are scary. That's a general rule of thumb in most horror films. But what's scarier than children? How about a mother, more specifically, a horrific ghost that adamantly protects her young? That's pretty unsettling, too. However, there is also a popular rule of thumb where you don't show the monster until the end of the movie, and when you do, the payoff had better be worth it. Guess which rule ""Mama"" violates?

""Mama"" centers around two girls who were abandoned in an old cabin in the middle of nowhere. And by ""abandoned"", I mean that their father kidnapped them, brought them to said cabin, and was about to kill them before someone (something) intervened (mutilated the father) and decided to take care of the children themselves. Long story short, the children's uncle finds them after 5 years of searching, and when taken into his care, something else tags along. That premise alone is an interesting one made moreso by the idea that at the time of their rescue, the children behaved in the same manner as the apparition that watched over them. Observing how the two girls move, communicate, and interact with their new surroundings is equal parts fascinating and frightening, like peering into a window where something more sinister lurks inside, and just out of your line of sight.

And, for a good portion of the film, it does pull that idea off successfully. There are some clever implementations of common horror elements (with a few cheap jump scares thrown in) as well as a few uncommon ones as well. However, there is only so much unique fabrics you can use before you get to the end of the tapestry and discover that you've run out of good threads. But rather than substituting uniqueness for something a little plain, yet visually digestible, someone else does a hack job at the last minute, resulting in the entire body of work unravelling at a rapid pace until only a heap of rubbish is left. That analogy accurately describes the last third of the film, which is so laughably absurd, that it would fit more into the category of parody than anything else. This problem rests largely with how ""Mama"", the spirit that took care of the girls, is presented to us. Instead of having a terrifying demeanor and equally frightening looks, ""Mama"" looks like a cross between the Wicked Witch and a deformed cabbage patch doll. Just as unintentionally humorous is when the film attempts to provide a backstory for her. Instead of being insightful or, dare I say it, engaging, it's so embarrassing and poorly conceived that it would've been a better idea if it had been left to the audiences imagination.

It is noted that Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) produced and presented this film to a wider audience. Normally, it would be surprised that such a talented director would associate himself with this mess, but looking at his past production effort (the highly disappointing spanish film, The Orphanage), the shock is less severe this time around.

With all that said, ""Mama"" is a waste of something that could have been much more. If they had provided an ending that wasn't plagued with ham-fisted writing, awkward scripting, and laughable ""horror"" sequences, then ""Mama"" would've been considered a decent, but interesting, horror film. Instead, it's like a moth driven to the flame: something that manages to get off the ground, but meets a horrific end soon after.",1361145600,3,3399,4.865284974093265

Mama
Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic

""Mama"" tells the story of two young sisters, Lily and Victoria, who are abandoned in the woods for five years. When the girls are found and taken into custody by their uncle and his girlfriend Annabelle, everyone begins to wonder how these toddlers could have survived for so long on their own. The girls' strange behavior leads Annabell to believe that the girls weren't alone in the woods after all, and in fact, a troubled ghost called Mama was caring for them. But when they leave the forest, they don't leave Mama.

I really enjoy this movie. It is definitely scary to watch, but when it is over it doesn't leave you feeling afraid. I'm convinced this movie is a mix between ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Possession."" It has a very similar ghost with the same motives as The Woman in Black, and has the same creepy bugs from ""The Possession."" The ending is especially similar to ""The Woman in Black."" No spoiler alerts or anything, but you think all will be fine but it's not. I guess you shouldn't go to a horror film if you're looking for a happy ending.

I like the cinematography, and the use of lighting and sound track, to set the ominous mood for this film. The dull colors and grey wash of the scenery really helps the spook level of the movie. The one thing I have a real problem with was the animation of Mama's face in the last few scenes. This is supposed to be the height of the horror, the film's climax, but Mama's face is so unrealistic that it pulls me out of my horrified trance and I am no longer scared.

My favorite character is Annabell (Jessica Chastain), because she isn't too enthusiastic about suddenly having to take on a motherly role, especially since the girls have serious social problems. Her boyfriend, the main caretaker of the kids, gets seriously injured, leaving Annabell in charge. I love watching her relationship develop into love for Lily and Victoria, and when Mama comes to play, she does a wonderful job showing her fear.

My favorite scene is in the very beginning of the movie, when it shows how one-year-old Lily and three-year-old Victoria end up in the woods. It is a very twisted scene, but I like how they show the girls adapting to their new surroundings. They adapt through crayon drawings on the walls, which is very creative.

I give Mama 4 out of 5 stars because it is definitely thrilling, but since it is so similar to some other films in this genre, I have to take a point away for lack of originality. I recommend ""Mama"" for ages 13 and up because of its intense content. If you're into anything Horror, Thriller or ghost related, then you'll love Mama so go check it out!

The girls have gone feral so naturally they wind up in government care. They show signs of recovery. The shrink working with them wants the girls to have a stable home life to continue the improvements. Lucas is an artist and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) plays guitar in a rock band. They are not exactly model parents, especially when another aunt wants custody. The shrink recommends for Lucas and Annabel after cutting a deal where he can continue to observe the children. His practice offers them a normal suburban house to live in where they uneasily set up their new family. Too bad the supernatural entity that took care of the kids in the cabin came with them to the new home. And is jealous, very jealous, of the girls' affection.

The movie spends a lot of time and effort on the set up. Instead of making the story slow, they created interesting characters and a believable enough situation that viewers naturally want to find out what's going on and what's going to happen. The actors do a great job, making the movie more compelling and interesting throughout. It's a well-crafted and well-acted horror film.

The whole movie emphasizes atmosphere. A lot of the terror is created through the sound effects--the sounds of the ghost, the evocative music, etc. The visuals are effective because they are restrained. The spiritual entity Mama is, like the shark in Jaws, not really seen until the end. One or two of the jump scares are telegraphed too much, robbing them of shock value. Otherwise the film is very well crafted and thrilling. The gore is very minimal and probably why the movie is rated PG-13 (though it is more like 13 going on 21--not at all kid-appropriate unless your kid likes to have nightmares).

Recommended as a horror film in the vein of The Woman in Black.",1529452800,,1955,4.7272727272727275
