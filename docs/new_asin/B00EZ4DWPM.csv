5957804,2,B00EZ4DWPM,The best part of the movie was the trailer. Please don't waste your money. Especially since AMAZON has jacked the prices up on these B movies,1395705600,,141,4.461538461538462
5957805,3,B00EZ4DWPM,"I'd mostly say that this movie was about veteran's and their contribution during war time.  The zombies are almost an afterthought.
The movie attempts to take you into war from the soldier's perspective, through the banal parts, the exhaustion, the never knowing what's going to happen...even the questioning of orders, which of course they are never supposed to do.

I think this was mostly about honoring vets.",1390867200,,412,5.134328358208955
5957806,5,B00EZ4DWPM,Great storyline. I never lost interest in the movie. Great acting. I have watched the movie more than a few times. I've given away two of the dvd's as gifts.,1389657600,,157,4.266666666666667
5957807,2,B00EZ4DWPM,From the film their was exactly from I remember no zombies being killed. The characters say they haved killed zombies but it was really them at a questionalble outpost to be safe from zombies. Mainly from war movie stand point is soldiers on their downtime during zombie apocalypse. END RESULT NOT WORTH BUYING,1387929600,3,310,4.867924528301887
5957808,4,B00EZ4DWPM,"I admit that I was a little leery about renting this movie since it was rated 1.5 stars but I have to say I'm glad I did! This movie is severely underrated in my opinion and after watching the trailer I decided to give it a chance. It has an interesting premise, it's about an author interviewing three veteran survivor's from the worse battle of the Zombie War which at least in this movie we did win. IT's similar to the premise that the book World War Z had in it except the scope of book was more worldwide! Anyway this movie had pretty good production values and the cast I thought did a very credible job of portraying combat vets. I will admit that some of the special effects with the weapons were a little cheesey but that was a minor thing. If you are a zombie movie or book fan than this movie is worth a look, I don't think you'll be disappointed!",1387756800,,859,4.212121212121212
5957809,1,B00EZ4DWPM,"A journalist interviews 3 survivors of Gory Ridge, a zombie war scene. 6 men were sent to reinforce a group of soldiers. They were the only ones to survive. They appear to suffer from PTSD and this is therapy for them. The men talk more generally about war and people who fight them then their specific zombie war as they fought against the ""zulu's""

The soldiers had to walk 20 miles to get to the ridge and I felt like I walked every step with them. The soldiers had automatic weapons with an infinite amount of CG bullets fighting against unarmed zombies. Sure they aren't foot dragging, but how difficult could it be? I am not sure what it says about these ""heroes"" as a man with an automatic weapon is overtaken by a zombie in a t-shirt armed with a set of teeth. But anyway, that's what they do. They visit the grave of their friend and recall how he was killed as they deal with survivor guilt.

The journalist appears to be typing on an old electric word processor. The production uses zombies as a generic enemy while they attempt to pay tribute to everyone who has fought, died, or survived a war. Unfortunately using zombies and a hand held camera cheapens the tribute.

It was like watching a zombie documentary about a fictional battle that wasn't done well.

Best Dialogue of film:

Soldier 1: They're dead. Stop shooting!!!
Soldier 2: How do you know?
Soldier 1: They're not moving.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Not much blood, zombies, soldiers, or acting.",1387670400,,1468,4.583969465648855
5957810,2,B00EZ4DWPM,"Not  another zombie movie!
Ok, what we have here is a reporter writing about the experiences of 3 surviving soldiers of a zombie attack on a Ridge near Victorville, California.  He writes using a typewriter, which is odd in these days and times.  The reporter is writing about when he got with the surviving soldiers and went to the ""Ridge"" where they survived and repelled a zombie attack--mixed with flashbacks from the soldiers.  The writer embellishes how severe the fight was and attempts to explain what happened in one million words or less.  The narration from the writer left me looking for a sharp impliment to off myself with.  The closest funny thing about his monotone talking is in a different movie ""Airplane"" when the pilot kept telling everyone about ""Macho Grande""--The narration reminded me of this,  Example---The soldiers led me to this area of heartache where they lost so many friends.""  Ok--there were 6 of them and 3 survived and the reporter is talking like this battle was a massive undertaking to save the world.  If you want some zombies, they have some near the end of it.  The camera effects seemed made by a newer home video camera where ""Steady Camm"" is used, but it appears jerky.  If you rent this, I can't tell you if you will like it or not.  I like some bad zombie films--but this one is an hour and a half that I will never get back!",1384646400,8,1372,4.577868852459017
8610573,1,B00EZ4DWPM,"This movie started  a nice slow burn, building what I thought would be a decent background story, and I was waiting for some real live (or dead) zombie action to pop off at any moment... No zombies until the end... And then they are disappointing... Would not recommend.",1505779200,,270,4.625
8610574,1,B00EZ4DWPM,"Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Writing was awful.  Heard ""at this point"" used 3 times in 1 minute at beginning and it just went downhill from there.  The film was impossible to watch, since half of it was blue-filtered, while the ""present day"" parts were so poorly-lit I couldn't see them.  None of it made much sense.  Seriously why would you carrry an AT4 rocket to deal with zombies?  Don't waste your time on this movie.  The reviews are better.",1504483200,,451,4.6923076923076925
8610575,1,B00EZ4DWPM,Couldn't get past the second narrator piece. horrendous writing and painful to listen to.,1504483200,,89,5.428571428571429

8610577,3,B00EZ4DWPM,I pulled out early on this one.  It was a tad slow for my taste and certainly for a zombie flick.  Three stars because some may like it.,1503792000,,136,3.8214285714285716
8610578,5,B00EZ4DWPM,"Respect!  Good B movie.  Just like World War Z book, just lower budget.",1503446400,,71,4.384615384615385
8610579,1,B00EZ4DWPM,"Idea is good; should be since it's based on the book World War Z, but it is terrible.
Bad acting, Terrible pretentious writing, washed out filming to make it seem bleak was so bad I had to stop watching it.
There is so much wrong with this I don't know where to start. I'm going to guess that the budget for this movie was very small, and if the budget was so small, maybe drastically scale down production. If the phrase, we would have but we didn't have the budget was used for any part, then re-write and do more story telling with less visual.
EDIT: had to add this, IMDB estimated budget $1000. I've known broke college film students that put more than that into their projects. Congrats on getting this Amazon somehow.",1503446400,2,724,4.41044776119403
8610580,4,B00EZ4DWPM,"Excellent movie for such a low budget B Flick. Movie focuses mainly on the camaraderie and selfless service of service members first and foremost. While obvious low budget the special effects weren't terrible, and was pulled off quite well. From the tactics, movements, lingo, and uniforms you can tell the director knew what he was doing. The actors had to have some type of military background as they played the role about as perfectly as I have seen, even big budget military blockbusters could take a training lesson or two from these guys. The soundtrack and sound effects were right on for the theme.",1502582400,,607,4.846153846153846
8610581,3,B00EZ4DWPM,"If you like zombies, and documentaries, this is one for you. Borrowing heavily from the concept of (the book) World War Z, it's about an author writing about a past zombie near-apocalypse from the point of view of three veteran soldiers in that conflict and what they endured on ""Gory Ridge"". You won't get much in the way of zombies until the last 15 minutes or so, but the story is pretty tight. It's a bit maudlin, though, so don't expect a lot of laughs. It tries to be gritty in the flashback sequences, and the CGI gun play in it is better than a lot of other examples from the low budget end of this genre.",1501286400,,613,4.247863247863248
8610582,1,B00EZ4DWPM,"Stilted writing, poorly acted, childish special effects. Decent idea, poor execution.",1499558400,,85,6.818181818181818
