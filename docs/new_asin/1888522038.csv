7800926,5,1888522038,"This is a wonderful look at some of the last surviving Shaker women, complete with information about the founding of the Shaker movement in the colonial period and its development into the 1970s. Individual Shakers comment on their motivations for joining, their beliefs, and the overall experience of being a Shaker. (Almost all of these women have since passed away, which is why I say the documentary is ""unrepeatable."") Scenes of Shaker singing and ""dance"" movements are captivating and sweet. I am so glad it has become available again after being out of print for many years.",1330041600,,581,5.0
