8104503,1,B000E1Z7QM,The entire movie is a series of 3-7 second clips of every monster truck making jumps! There is no narration and there is no footage amid a single full run. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.,1483056000,,187,3.9473684210526314

8104508,4,B000E1Z7QM,"I bought this for my two year old son and he likes to watch it. It's a good compilation of various trucks. The footage is grouped by the truck (several El Toro Loco clips, several Gravedigger, etc.)  and is more or less highlights of their runs. It's what I expected.",1295049600,,267,4.34
