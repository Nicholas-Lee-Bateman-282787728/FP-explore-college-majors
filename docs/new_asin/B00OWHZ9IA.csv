6775711,5,B00OWHZ9IA,Very funny series.  A lot of cultural references so if you aren't that familiar with Japanese culture be prepared to pause frequently to read the notes that explain things at times,1429747200,,180,4.806451612903226

6775713,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"Like most places on Earth, Hell is run by a bureaucracy. They have all the same problems as humans - internal disputes, staffing issues, and foreign relations problems. The only differences are the pools of boiling blood and screaming souls of the dead. And maybe a few other things...
Hozuki is the aide to King Enma, the ruler of hell. A bureaucrat with hundreds of years of experience, he solves problems with calm and a great big spiky club. In his spare time he enjoys fawning over cute animals and gardening.

Episodes are generally divided into two vignettes per episodes and it doesn't have a real overarching storyline, though it does have some connected story lines.

Hozuki no Retetsu has rather dry sense of humor that isn't for everyone. Of the people I've showed it to, 1 out of 5 liked it. The humor greatly reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Humanity-Has-Declined/dp/B00EZ229WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8""> Humanity Has Declined</a>&nbsp;(Jinrui ga Suiteshimashita), which now I think about it, had the same reactions from the same people. It is dry, dark, and generally hilarious if you enjoy that sort of thing. Another recommendation might be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Teen-Romantic-Comedy-SNAFU/dp/B00J9IP7NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU</a>&nbsp;(similar humor but totally different type of story).

If the synopsis intrigues you, you can give the series a try on Chrunchyroll for free. If you don't enjoy the first episode, then stop there because that is what the rest of the series is like. If you like it, well then good! The rest of the series is pretty much the same.",1424131200,5,1728,5.7421875
6775714,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"This is the story of Hozuki, the Administrative Assistant to King Enma of Hell, Judger of Souls.  He is so diabolical, he scares the European Leader of Hell (Satan) into being good!  Since Hell is run like a mega corporation, it is advertised like an Onsen (Hot-spring Resort).  Ever sooooo respectful of his boss, He tirelessly preforms his duties.  Just do not let him catch you abusing any animals!

This anime zings anything and everything.  So, prepare your strait-jacket for when you finish viewing, as you will need it after all the maniacal laughter you will be doing.  Recommended for Vice Presidents, Administrative Assistants and anyone who is ""Number Two"" in your local power structure, as this anime proves, once again, that the real power is not Number One!",1423526400,6,771,4.930232558139535
8685219,4,B00OWHZ9IA,"Hoozuki has this laid back atmosphere that you wouldn't expect from an anime set in ... well ... hell. It's not in your face comedy but, there are a few episodes that made me burst into outright laughter! Overall, I think the intention was just to make you smile or chuckle a bit, and for me it did that and more!

The first time I heard the OP I make a face like -_-"" The OP is absurdly cheerful for an anime set in hell and at first I didn't care for it. But it grew on me ... kind of like mold >.<""  I actually love it now and I had begun to look forward to hearing it every episode ... go figure lol. The ED though was akin to torture, but again, if you take into account where Hoozuki is set ... it fits! xD

The characters were fun! Hoozuki scared the sh*t out of more than half the characters, but that simply added to the fun!  I also loved the rivalry between Hoozuki and Hakutaku. That was endlessly amusing to me! :D Hoozuki was a badass!  Enma was a funny character in the way he was supposed to be 'The Great King Enma' and yet ... Hoozuki was totally the one in charge! (Enma just didn't quite realize that fact!) xD

Overall, it's a very laid back anime that I enjoyed a great deal. I miss it! :( It's definitely a series I wish they made another season for! And one that is definitely worth adding to your collection!",1488758400,,1333,4.068702290076335
8685220,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"This series was something I watched closer to when it has originally come out, and I absolutely loved it. It's a light-hearted series with a wonderfully silly cast and entertaining references to Japanese folklore (for a brief little review of the series).

The product itself came quick and was in pristine condition when I got it, so I'm absolutely pleased. I don't often buy any series outright because it often is in the upwards of $30 and $40 at least, but Hozuki's Coolheadedness happens to not only be one of my favorites, but was sitting at a decent price--I couldn't resist.",1478822400,,582,4.762376237623762

8685223,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"It is so funny, especially the demons from other contries running afoul of mr Hozuki! Since its subtitled, I noticed it's a bit hard to read the little information/ explanation subtitles , which is a shame, the information is helpful. All in all, a fun anime to watch",1453593600,,267,4.583333333333333
8685224,5,B00OWHZ9IA,great show I know for a fact this based on reality because I've meet all the characters while I was floating in astral plane.,1448236800,,125,4.25

8685226,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"No English dub on this one. Just sub. But I still loved the series. Short with only 13 episodes it's still a fun look at what might be considered Japanese Hell if it were conducted more like a business setting instead of the traditional hell. with a look into the life of the strict and sometimes overly violent, ever serious faced Hozuki, the second in command to one of the great kings of hell, Lord Enma, who is more of the goofy grandfatherly type that usually ends up the butt of Hozuki's jokes.... and beatings. I'm guessing the writers were a fan of Studio Ghibli since they make a ton of references to different films and their characters.

May not suitable for young kids as it does depict blood, beating, the occasional partially bleeped curse word (except hell, of course), some talk of overly promiscuous characters and drinking and the occasional talk of bathroom humor.

If you like fun, quirky supernatural animes that takes a more comedic approach to darker subjects such as Hell, I suggest you give it a watch. Just be careful if you're watching it with the English subtitles and you have to pause. Try to pause when the subtitles are on the screen. If you pause in the wrong place you temporarily lose your subtitles until the scene changes and will have to rewind it just right.",1438387200,,1297,4.6103896103896105

8685228,5,B00OWHZ9IA,"I first watched the series when it was airing in Japan, because I have a personal love for Japanese mythology and folklore. WIthout reservation, I will tell you this show is a great introduction to some of the concepts involving the world of jigoku (hell, but not really.its hard to explain in a review properly) and the beings the populate this underworld. While viewers must always recall the golden rule that the reality of cultural concepts is always more nuanced than any anime can make it appear to be, this show does wonders with regards to pointing major legends (like Momotaro and his animal companions), major personages (King Enma), and gives one of the most condensed, best argued descriptions of how jigoku is structured (done up as an educational video of the sort companies use for training videos), guaranteeing that viewers who are interested will look deeper and deeper into the presented mythology.

But what really made the show fun for me is how much it borrows from, and indirectly mirrors, the same type of humor and irreverence that was found in Mike Judge's King of the Hill. The straight-laced right hand man administrator working for a superficially inept boss; the quirky traits of his underlings; his attention to detail and due process; and the weird situations Hozuki finds himself in go hand in hand with that long-running animated sitcom, and appeal to those who appreciate snark and sarcasm, but also visual puns and outlandish behavior. The series breaks these down into half-episode vignettes that resolve quickly and efficiently, never truly overstaying their welcome.

In addition, the creators reached out to other mythologies, so its not rare to see Anubis or Satan himself make an appearance, only to fall victim to culture shock or the vast differences between how jigoku runs in comparison to how they run their own realm. Its almost like the writers were playing up the culture trade card, and showcasing how outsiders will find themselves in over their headnot unlike some viewers experiencing these legends for the first time.

The voice acting in impeccable, with characters sounding exactly as you'd expect them to sound. You can hear the dry tones in Hozuki's voice, become thoroughly annoyed with Momotaro's whining, and snicker at Enma's bizarre inflections that fit in flawlessly with his character. Careful attention was definitely paid to detail, and it rewards the astute viewers who takes the time to uncover subtle references, or research the in-jokes for a second viewing.

All told, this is a very fun series that deserves far more of an audience, thanks to its excellent blending of folklore, comedy, and situational chaos.",1432771200,9,2683,5.0770975056689345
