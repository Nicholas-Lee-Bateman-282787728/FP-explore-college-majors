2859372,5,B000R7G6JA,"Here we go.....Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol! Remember watching this years ago, then looking through the TV listings for it to be on again, only to see it once a few years later, then trying to see it the next year or missing it  again??  IMHO this is one of the better Christmas cartoons, yet it's usually on a strange time or an obscure channel.  Then if you tape it, either you tape over it by accident or six month later are short on space and figure you'll catch it next year and tape over it.

If you're a fan of these shows, I think it'll be hard to pass up the opportunity to purchase them all together as a set.",1196294400,16,618,4.125
2859373,5,B000R7G6JA,This is great i love these cartoons the best ones made and they never seem to play them on tv anymore. These are so hard to find in australia and if you do find them you can expect to pay $80+.Excellent item well packed in a nice box and a bonus christmas songs disc. And region 1 plays on my DVD player im so happy.,1196208000,,316,3.876923076923077
2859374,4,B000R7G6JA,"I watched Rudolph with my wife and kids last night.  They loved it!  It looks great, but when Clarice sings her song (""There's Always Tomorrow""), a high pitched whine was audible throughout the song.(very high pitched, some people won't be able to hear it)  I couldn't hardly believe my ears.  The rest of the movie was flawless and has a few small scenes that I've never seen/noticed before.

All in all a great addition to my Christmas collection",1196121600,18,448,4.6923076923076925
2859375,4,B000R7G6JA,"We all love ""Rudolph,"" and ""Frosty,"" and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town."" ""Little Drummer Boy"" still makes me weep like a baby and the little known ""Cricket on the Hearth"" is a buried gem. I can even accept the odd addition of ""Mr Magoo"" (which is not a Rankin-Bass product) to the collection, but I have no idea who thought it was a good idea to put the NON-Rankin Bass Frosty special here instead of the ""real"" Frosty sequel: ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland.""

Don't be fooled.  ""Frosty Returns"" is NOT by Rankin Bass and does not feature Jackie Vernon as voice of the venerable snowman or Karen the little girl or the story of Jack Frost trying to steal the hat so all the children will appreciate him instead of Frosty.  ""Frosty Returns"" is a poorly written and poorly animated ""special"" and does not belong surrounded by these other true Christmas classics.  But if you don't mind that and Magoo, it is a great collection of some of the TRUE holiday classics.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frosty-s-Winter-Wonderland-Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas/dp/B0002M5U7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas</a>",1196035200,157,1192,5.569060773480663

I have seen it so many times I can practically recite it.  We also watch the others.  I find it heartwarming to hear the voices of famous people no longer with us, and some who still are.  Peolpe like Jimmy Durante, Bille DeWolf, Fred Astaire, Jim Backus and Micket Rooney do the voiceovers.  My personal favorite is Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.  Other stories are Santa Claus is Coming to Town, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Little Drummer Boy, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Frosty Returns.  There is also a CD of some famous Christmas Songs.  Anyone with young kids or grandkids should have this collections.

I have them both and while I wouldn't want to give up the other one this one get a higher rating since it has more Original Favorites that I remember from when I was young.

2859543,1,B000R7G6JA,"I didn't realize how bad these movies were growing up. I watched them every year as a child; I even looked forward to them, but honestly, they are trash. Watching them now thirty-five years later, I see they have horrible story lines, poor dialogue, and terrible behavior. For example, Rudolph is bullied to a degree that I didn't remember, even by Santa, an elf hits another elf over the head to test a toy, another elf removes the teeth of the abominable snowman, and some very demeaning comments in general. I feel these movies exposed my children to ideas and attitudes that are verboten today for good reason. Not everything that is ""old"" or ""original"" is of true value - and some isn't worth anything beyond studying the change in societal attitudes from generation to generation.",1355616000,2,786,4.786764705882353

Cricket on the Hearth is the only one I never watched before (or even head of), and now I'm glad I haven't. It's incredibly depressing and boring. The other six are all wonderful Christmas classics and I will always enjoy watching. Also, as a bonus, this set comes with an audio CD of Christmas songs!",1355270400,,379,4.277777777777778

2859551,5,B000R7G6JA,"What a wonderful ""compendium"" of childhood memories! I used to watch these animated films every year before Christmas when I lived in  the United States. I particularly looked forward to seeing ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"". I bought these DVDs so that I could pass on these seasonal classics to my son, who had just turned 5 when I have this to him. Unfortunately the ""abominable snowman"" scared him a bit ... to it might be more appropriate for a 6-7 year old. Let's see if he is willing to watch it with me again this year!",1354924800,,529,4.510416666666667
2859552,1,B000R7G6JA,"I ordered this and all the plastic inside of the DVD set arrived smashed. You could literally hear all the tiny pieces moving around when you moved around the DVD set, and you could see all the tiny pieces of plastic moving around inside. You could also hear the DVDs moving around because all of their plastic keepers were shattered. I didn't even open it because I knew it had to immediately go back. Shame on you Amazon. Where is your quality control??? How could you send something like this out to anyone much less a loyal, long-term customer? And it was not broken in transit because the box it arrived in didn't have a dent.",1352073600,,631,4.448275862068965

2859554,5,B000R7G6JA,"I have enjoyed the DVD Christmas Classics. My favorite is ""Frosty the Snowman"". I don't like ""Frosty Returns"", though.  The other DVDs are good. I like to watch them on my computer.  I watch them all year.",1349222400,,205,4.513513513513513
2859555,5,B000R7G6JA,"The classic shows on this DVD set are simply a joy to watch again and again. However, the more modern Frosty show, ""Frosty Returns"", is definitely the worst of he bunch. ""Frosty Returns"" is a poorly written and poorly animated ""special"" and does not belong with these other Christmas classics. I'll pass on that one.
The Little Drummer Boy is still my personal favorite even after all these years.
I recommend this set so you can watch them when you want and not when the network decides to put them on...plus you're not bothered by all those pesky commercials :) You'll get hours of enjoyment and some good family time, because parents/grandparents can sit down with there children/grandchildren and watch all these classics together(well almost all of them.)",1345680000,,760,4.9453125

They didn't hold her interest for the most part. The only one that was cute was frosty. I wish I would have just bought that dvd alone. Frosty returns was bad REALLY bad.

2859566,4,B000R7G6JA,"I bought this right after the New Year Post Christmas  sales.

 Being a big kid, lover of watching Christmas movies all year round and like most growing up with these classics since I was a small child my eyes widen when I saw this.

4 classics (if you count Frosty Returns) and 2 old ones I've never seen and have never heard of ""Cricket on the Hearth"" but can see why they don't show it, it's bad. I do love Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (I have heard of Mr. Magoo and seen his show, but not the Christmas Carol). And a Christmas CD which I like.

What I don't like about it:
- I wish the DVDs had a ""Play All"" option. It would be nice to have the option and not have to go through the menus to get to the next movie.

- I wish it had the whole Rankin/Bass collection. I wish they would make one.

Overall this is a great collection to watch!",1313107200,,842,4.005988023952096

This is a very good collection for anyone who watched these as kids or are looking for wholesome holiday films to watch as a family. My only complaint is that the whole Rankin/Bass collection isn't here. It's not enough to not buy this collection (I've yet to find a complete Rankin/Bass collection anywhere), but it's worth noting that it is missing my favorite movie: The Year Without Santa Claus.",1312588800,2,532,4.9222222222222225

My bf and I made pepermint hot cocoa and settled in for a night of early childhood memories. I was dissapointened in the fact that the Santa Claus movie for some reason will not work. All the other movies work perfectly. Maybe I got a bad disk :( I didn't return it because I had already opened and threw away all shipping info.

I also bought The Year Without a Santa Claus (Deluxe Edition)and Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas to round out the collection.,1296604800,,273,4.869565217391305
2859572,3,B000R7G6JA,"Five of the cartoons on here are classics, which is the reason I wanted this collection.  The oldest, and, indeed, the first animated special produced for TV, ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" was unfamiliar to me but it is charming.  Unfortunately, the last two cartoons are not worth the time it takes to view them.  ""Cricket on the Hearth"" was predictable and dull.  In contrast to the five classics, which I re-watch every year, I wouldn't have an interest in seeing this one again.

The last movie, ""Frosty Returns"" is NOT to be confused with the original Rankin-Bass sequel where Frosty gets married (""Frosty's Winter Wonderland."" Oh, no, this is a modern cartoon, and it is cringe-inducingly awful.  The premise - a bad guy similar to Mr. Burns from ""The Simpsons"" wants to melt all the snow and some snow-weary residents think this is a good idea so it is up to the kids and Frosty to save winter - is fine, but the execution is appalling.  The character of Frosty is unpleasant and has a grating, horrible voice.  The worst part is the music - the songs are painful, unlistenable.  I can't articulate how poorly done this cartoon is.  It's not bad in a fun way that might lead it to become a cult classic; it's just bad.  I don't understand why the DVD, since it had other Rankin-Bass specials, didn't have the real sequel, which is what I thought I was getting.",1296432000,5,1368,4.588477366255144

I specifically bought it for Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town and The Little Drummer Boy - I could care less about Mr. Magoo, the imitation Frosty sequel and Cricket on the Hearth (if you don't like them or care for them then simply don't watch them) but the 1st 4 I named are what makes this set worth it and the packaging is pretty neat too.

When I saw her enjoying these classics brought me back to the first time I saw them. A really great dvd set that is fun to watch and will now be an awesome tradition.
Comes with everything discribed. And the cable channels don't play most of other shows anymore. My favorite is The Little Drummer Boy. You never get to see this one anymore on TV.

This is a great start to a collection (though I would recommend adding the origional Grinch, Charlie Browns Christmas, and Mickey Mouse Christmas Carol).

2859706,5,B000R7G6JA,"In my opinion ""Cricket on the Hearth"" is not a Christmas show. It has nothing to do with Christmas. It's just about a toy maker who's daughter goes blind. There isn't even a miracle at the end, like her getting her sight back. There's nothing about Jesus, Santa, Christmas trees, presents, ect. There's not even any snow. I don't feel this show belongs in this set. Don't get me wrong I like the show, it's just not about Christmas. There are others that have do do with Christmas that could have been on instead like ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"", ""Frosty's Winter wonderland"", ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"", ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"". I call that last one a Chritmas program not just because of the title, but because Santa Claus, Rudolph and Frosty are all on.",1291248000,,785,4.654676258992806
2859707,5,B000R7G6JA,"As a now parent of 3 young kids who grew up when these classics were first released I wondered if the stop motion puppeteering and 60's and 70's era animation would be well received by my kids born from 1999 on. No, there's no computer generated animation in these classics. I think that when these originally came out the smallest computer in the world probably took up the entire space of a mid-sized living room.

So would these classics still be relevant in 2010? The answer is a resounding yes! My kids, especially my youngest, can't get enough. After watching Rudolf, Frosty, Santa and Magoo this past weekend, it was and is heartwarming to watch my kids singing the songs and carols on a daily basis from these DVDs.

We've actually already had Rudolf on DVD for a couple of years, but the rest were all new to my kids. And they love them. Regardless of whether they end up being more favorable to some of the stories than others, the price of this set is such a deal for all of these classics; buying this just for the personal sentimental value of a few TV shows that touched me as a child makes it worth it.

The only oddball in the collection is Frosty Returns. This came out well after the others in the collection (in the 90s if I'm not mistaken), and while there must have neen some magic in that old silk hat they found in the original Frosty, the magic disapates significantly with Frosty Returns. No matter....

Get your family into the true spirit of Christmas with this DVD set. Add it to your cart.",1291248000,,1518,4.43010752688172
2859708,5,B000R7G6JA,"Growing up in our house, we always had to make sure we had the christmas classics scheduled into our holiday outings, so getting this for my younger siblings (7-10) and my kids (in the not too distant future) was a great find.  I had never seen the Mr. Magoo christmas special or the Cricket on the Hearth, but I'm hoping to make them part of our family traditions with the little ones.

Also, as an added bonus, the 4th disc has holiday music from the movies.  Chances are you've heard the songs or even have them on other albums, but definitely a good thing for the kids to pop into their CD player in their room or in the car after watching the shows.

The packaging is sturdier than I thought (I guess to stand up to the little hands that will be handling it).  The shows are on 3 discs along with the music CD.

Note: I've seen this same collection in a few other stores so far this year, but couldn't find it cheaper than on Amazon the Sunday before Black Friday.",1290988800,,969,4.239130434782608
2859709,5,B000R7G6JA,"I loved these shows when I was a child. I have many fond memories of sitting with my parents and grandparents watching these shows every Christmas season. It is so rare now to see any of them on TV that were it not for this set of DVDs, I wouldn't be able to share moments like that with my own daughter. I cannot tell you how it warmed my heart to hear her trying to sing along with ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" or clapping for Rudolph when he flew up in the air shouting, ""She thinks I'm cuuuuuuute!""

The case is very nicely done, it seems strong and sturdy enough to let the kids play with it while we're watching the movies.

2859712,5,B000R7G6JA,"Rudolph, Santa, Frosty,Little Drummer Boy,Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol, Cricket on the Hearth are truly classics. Why they put Frosty Returns in there is a mystery. I have never seen it in all my 55yrs. The children almost look like Charlie Brown. That aside it is a great set. They have been restored but you can still at times see flicks of the film running. I personally love that, makes it just like it was on TV when I was a child. If you grew up on these then you will love them all over again.

My very favorite is The Little Drummer Boy. I have wanted a copy for years. I had it on VHS from the TV but it was poor quality, they did a great job on restoring it.

You also get a CD to play the songs which I missed when ordering the God Box Deal. I was so excited at the price and that it had my favorites on it. Just wish they had the the real sequel to Frosty.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frosty-s-Winter-Wonderland-Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas/dp/B0002M5U7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frosty's Winter Wonderland/Twas the Night Before Christmas</a>guess I have to get that by it's self.

My favorite Christmas Cartoon of all time is ""Frosty The Snowman""; the original 1968 show voiced by Jackie Vernon and Jimmy Durante. The original, Restored ""Frosty""-- as well as superbly Restored editions of ""The Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Santa Claus Is Claus Is Coming To Town""-- are reason enough to purchase this well-designed and presented DVD set. And ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"", with music and lyrics by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (""Funny Girl"") is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

This makes ""Hong Kong Phooey"" look like Shakespeare. Not to be too nit-picky here, but in Frosty the Snowman, it is obvious that the magician still owned that hat, and I am not entirely comfortable with my children learning ""finders keepers losers weepers"" as a code of ethics.

The features themselves are a joy to watch, especially sweet when you don't have to deal with commercials.

Price is great and packaging is top notch.  However, it may be just me, but I was hoping that Little Drummer Boy would have been cleaned up / remastered a little more...a great show is hurt by the muddy vhs transfer; this is a shame because it's a true gem in the Rankin / Bass collection.

Finally whoever owns the rights needs to release the following on dvd as well:

The First Christmas Snow
The Little Drummer Boy, Book II,
The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus

Mr. Magoo is sorta funny, but very dated, but I guess to call this dated when it's a take on Dickens is sorta redundent.  I must admit, The Cricket on the Hearth was cute, though id never heard of it.  The packaging of this set is nice, and it does make a nice gift, though frankly I always hated getting Christmas related gifts for Christmas because Christmas is over, who wants to watch Rudolph after Christmas, I mean, right?  Really, they show the best of this stuff on ABC between Thanksgiving and Christmas anyway, so really why buy this unless you just love watching this sort of thing over and over, there are some uh festive people that get into that, I am not one.

2859944,1,B000R7G6JA,"What ruins this set for me is the inclusion of the horrible ""Frosty Returns."" This was NOT the sequel to Frosty the Snowman. It was created by CBS in 1992 and is horrible. Rankin and Bass had nothing to do with it. R&B did, however, create the true sequel to Frosty the Snowman, called Frosty's Winter Wonderland...where he meets and marries Crystal. Replace the CBS crap with this true gem, and I'll buy this set. Otherwise, forget it.",1228348800,29,436,4.602564102564102

Encased to look and feel like a book (the spine is almost 1.5"" wide), the set opens to reveal facing pages of two discs which can then be unfolded to reveal the remaining two discs of Rudolph and Santa Claus, set against a winter wonderland scene featuring various characters from the 4-disc collection (see Customer Images).

The care in presentation makes this boxed set of Christmas classics a heirloom item. Highly recommend as a gift for your own home as well as for others who enjoy the TV specials every year.

You save yourself alot of money by buying this set, they do sell the movies individually but you end up paying alot more to collect all these treasures. In edition is the music cd.

I bring this set out just after Holloween. My kids enjoy having a mini Christmas film festival (although our collection has grown so large it takes a while to get through all of them.

The others are just right! Santa is Comin to Town is the ""Life and Adventures"" tale based(loosely) on the 1902 novella yet not so Pagenesque.  Micky Roony as always does a great santa.  Burl Ives, the narrator should have been given duel roles though as his voice is much better.

All your standard favs are here, including Rudolph, Frosty and Santa.  But we also get to go way back to the very first r Magoo's Christmas Carol, yes he pre-dates Rudy by two years,  and ending with one hardly ever shown anymore Cricket on the Hearth!  One extra special note this set includes one of the rarest Christmas stories ever put on film, the Little Drummmer Boy.

2860016,5,B000R7G6JA,"This collection, along with Christmas Television Favorites, offers a rather complete collection of Christmas televsion specials. Together the collections make a nice pair and contain the original shows and the sequels that followed. The picture quality and sound are top-notch. The stories are strong and entertaining to children and adults alike. The animation is amazing and the overall experience is colorful both visually and musically.

Of course, the ""best"" animation is the line animation. The stop-animation can be jerky, but if you take it for what it is, it is very imaginative.

I didn't chop off a star for this, but the music CD is a disappointment. In a future edition of this compilation, I would like to see a complete music soundtrack for all of the shows. As is, there is about 15 minutes of music and only some of the songs are from the shows with a few things thrown in that don't fit. The show songs are so wonderful, I would even be interested in a digitally remastered CD sold separately. If you get this, you will probably ignore the music CD. But that won't detract from the wonderful shows!

2860020,5,B000R7G6JA,"Classic Media brings us 7 Christmas specials in one gorgeous package in its ""Original Christmas Classics"" DVD collection. The headliners of this set are the three greatest Rankin/Bass Christmas TV specials of all-time: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town! In addition to these, we are treated to ""The Little Drummer Boy"", ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"", ""Cricket on the Hearth"", and ""Frosty Returns"". Plus, a CD of holiday music selections is even included as a bonus!

Disc One features everyone's favorite Rankin/Bass special, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" Based on the beloved song, it's the stop-motion ""animagic"" classic from 1964 about a little reindeer born with a nose that glows red! Teased about his nose as a child, Rudolph runs away from Santa's village and makes new friends along the way but also encounters the frightening Bumble snow-beast! Then, when a fog comes up to threaten Santa's Christmas Eve flight, it's only Rudolph's nose that can save the day! Featuring unforgettable songs from Burl Ives (who plays Sam the Snowman) and others, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has become a holiday tradition loved by millions!

Also on Disc One is ""Cricket on the Hearth."" Introduced by Danny Thomas and starring the voices of himself, his daughter Marlo, Roddy McDowall, Hans Conried, Paul Frees, and more, this 1967 traditionally animated special is a musical version of Charles Dickens' classic. It's the story of a toymaker and his daughter who befriend a helpful cricket that saves the day after the family falls on hard times. ""Cricket on the Hearth"" is a lesser known Rankin/Bass production and not as endearing as their bigger hits, but it is still a nice holiday viewing you probably haven't seen before.

Disc Two holds a classic that is nearly as beloved as Rudolph, ""Frosty the Snowman"". This 1969 classic is traditionally animated and probably Rankin/Bass's best work in 2D. The charming character designs, voices, music, and simple story are absolutely wonderful. Based on another classic song, this is the story of a snowman that comes to life when the children who built him add a discarded magic hat. Unfortunately, snowmen can't last forever unless they are in a place that is always snowy, and the nasty Professor Hinkle, the frustrated magician who threw out his hat, wants the hat back now that he knows it holds real magical power! Hosted by an animated Jimmy Durante, ""Frosty the Snowman"" is such a treat that it even inspired three 2D sequels so far, though only ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"", from the same creators and with Jackie Vernon back as Frosty's voice, is really good. Disc Two also includes the only DVD bonus feature in this set, a Frosty pencil test.

Also on Disc Two is one of the more recent and very disappointing sequels, ""Frosty Returns."" Truthfully, I don't think this can be called an official sequel, as I don't think Rankin/Bass had anything to do with this 1992 rip-off. Surprisingly, this one is from the creators of the wonderful Peanuts specials, sans Charles Schulz, but it has none of that magic. ""Frosty Returns"", which depicts a Frosty voiced by John Goodman and with nothing in common with the original aside from being made of snow, is hosted by an animated (and for some reason miniature) Jonathan Winters in an attempt to mimic the host-character style of the Rankin/Bass faves. He presents the story of a town that is becoming snow-free thanks to a businessman's spray can invention, ""Summer Wheeze."" Frosty and his friends go on a mission to prove to the townsfolk that snow can actually be a good thing, but all in all it's a story that is pretty uninvolving and forgettable. What a shame they never couple the original Frosty with ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"". Unfortunately, you have to buy the other boxed set to get that one.

Disc Three features what is, in my opinion, the definitive version of how Santa became Santa. Well, along with ""Santa Claus, the Movie"" anyway. ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" is the name of the special, and it's the third of the three big-name classics in this DVD set. The 1970 animagic film, hosted by a stop-motion Fred Astaire, gives us the story of Santa being left at the doorstep of a toymaking elf family when he was a baby, being raised by them and amongst the forest animals, going on missions to deliver toys to the children of Sombertown, meeting Winter the warlock and Jessica, the future Mrs. Claus, and going up against the awful Burgermeister Meisterburger. This charming take on Santa's origins includes the voices of Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as Winter, and the great Paul Frees in several roles. Like most Rankin/Bass holiday classics, this is based on a classic song.

The remaining two holiday specials are also included on Disc Three. They are the lesser known but still much loved ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" a somewhat dark Rankin/Bass animagic tale from 1968 about an orphaned drummer boy who hates people and only loves his animal friends until a visit to the original nativity scene shows him the light, and 1962's ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" which presents the classic, nearsighted cartoon character as an actor in a Broadway production of his own version of ""A Christmas Carol."" Both specials are charming and appreciated inclusions in this DVD set.

Lastly, there's the CD, which is a mixed bag of 7 Christmas songs. They include a very brief ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" from Burl Ives, ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" from Bobby Rydell, ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" from Burl Ives, ""Silver and Gold"" from Burl Ives, ""Let it Snow"" from Chicago, ""Winter Wonderland"" from Jewel, and ""Merry Christmas Baby"" from Otis Redding. The CD is an okay addition, but a 4th disc of more holiday specials or more DVD bonus features would have been preferred, or even a genuine soundtrack to one or more of the included specials.

Overall, this set is a must own for the Christmas classics lover, and my only major complaint is how hard it is to remove the discs from the lovely packaging. I also highly recommend the following DVDs and DVD sets: Christmas Television Favorites (featuring other Rankin/Bass faves and the Grinch!), Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas, Disney's Classic Holiday Stories, Peanuts Classic Holiday Collection, The Happy Elf, Garfield Holiday Celebrations, Elf, A Muppet Family Christmas, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Warner Bros.

Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and Frosty the Snowman are great and my children watch these multiple times this past Christmas season.

2860042,4,B000R7G6JA,"I bought this brought after reading reviews from Amazon, and felt I was misled.  It seems that everyone agrees Frosty Returns is not up to par, but warmly endorced Little Drummer Boy and Cricket on the Hearth. Maybe if you grew up watching these shows, they would be nostalgic and heart-warming. But as a parent watching them with my little ones, they are unbearably cheesy!  Take a clue from TV--if they had stood the test of time, they would be yearly Christmas Specials.  Still, this seems to be the cheapest way to get Frosty and Rudolph together, but for those of you who want your kids aquiring good taste in television media, don't waste your time on these filler shows.",1198972800,,677,4.625

2860088,5,B000R7G6JA,"This box set includes the four original classic Christmas specials from Rankin/Bass: RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN, THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY & FROSTY THE SNOWMAN. These are all without question excellent holiday productions that have not only stood the test of time, but, if anything, become more popular as the years go by and have been permanently woven into the perennial fabric of Christmas. There are also 3 extra specials on this box-set, the recently unearthed and long forgotten about Rankin/Bass special CRICKET ON THE HEARTH and two non-Rankin/Bass specials MR MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL and the horrendous sequel FROSTY RETURNS. MR MAGOO seems out-of-place on this box set but it is a nice special while FROSTY RETURNS is out-of-place and terrible and really should have been left off. But I'm not going to subtract any stars for additional material, as it is just that, and you can choose if you want to watch it or not. All of the specials look and sound great except for THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY which for some reason has a very grainy look to it and some audio issues as well. There is another box set available from Warner Home Video entitled ""CHRISTMAS TELEVISION CLASSICS"" which includes some other popular Rankin/Bass specials such as ""Year Without A Santa Claus"", ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"". It would be nice if there could be a complete Rankin/Bass box set but seeing as how their catalog is owned by two seperate companies (the older ones by Classic Media and the newer ones by Warner) unfortunately, this will not be happening any time soon. Until then we will have Classic Media releasing these four classic with whatever add-on specials they can find, and Warner releasing their specials and trying hard to make the cover art look like they are actually these four specials.",1197331200,9,1857,4.917197452229299

This is great collection because it has the classic songs and cartoons.  The Cricket on the Hearth is included in this set and it's a little bizzare, but all in all this is the greatest set I've seen yet.

2860095,4,B000R7G6JA,"For the price this set is a good deal. Take away the filler (""The Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Frosty Returns"") and you still have more than four hours of classic Christmas television at a good price. In our house this simply replaces our old VHS of the outstanding ""Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer;"" the others we've only played once, but for the most part they're pretty good, if you're in the mood for some 1960s cheer.

The included seven-song audio CD is a mixed bag. It includes the Burl Ives numbers from ""Rudolph,"" but ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" is just the reprise. The other tunes? The classic Otis Redding cover of ""Merry Christmas Baby,"" a sweet version of ""Winter Wonderland"" by Jewel, a so-so big-band-style ""Let It Snow"" by the 1998 version of Chicago and a cringe worthy lounge lizard rendition of ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" recorded by 1960s teenybopper Bobby Rydell... in 2001.
