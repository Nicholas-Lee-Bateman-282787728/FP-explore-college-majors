The film is emotional, brutally honest, gripping and changed the way i thought of whale sharks forever.

Its not only a story but a documentation of what was happening to the whale sharks without the government knowing, without conservation agencies knowing and without the fishermen knowing about the envieonmental damage that was ongoing.

The film was finally used as a tool to bring the issue to the notice of the government and finally national and international wildlife protection agencies and was able to protect the whale shark legally in Inida and worldwide!!

You have to try and get your hands on this and watch it!",1250640000,,729,4.816
8652504,5,B002G9U954,"This is most likely one of the best wildlife documentary films i have ever seen, the film by Mike Pandey, documents how about 1,200 Whale Sharks were being killed in India. Incidently, the film was able to bring legal protection for the whale sharks in India under the wildlife protection act of 1972 and internationally under CITIES. I think the film has some 11+ awards including 2 National Awards and was directed by Mike Pandey [...] a legendary documentary film maker.",1248307200,,473,4.851851851851852
