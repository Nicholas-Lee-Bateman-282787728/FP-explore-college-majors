8349781,4,B0023GFVZS,"The disc is expensive because it is an import, the 136-page booklet includes the full libretto in four languages (English, Spanish, German, French, each available in subtitles), and modest sales are projected.

Customarily in DVD specs the time of 111 minutes would apply to the opera length. But actually the opera extends 77 minutes, plus curtain calls, leaving 30 minutes for two interviews with composer Cristobal Halffter (born 1930) and librettist Juan Carlos Marset. Presented without break, the opera is in five scenes (constituting the real content, totaling more than an hour) plus a Prelude and four Interludes which are staged but nonverbal.

THEATER AND CAST

The Theater Kiel is of moderate size. The lip of the stage extends over the rear of the orchestra pit, which is indeed a round pit--meaning the musicians are about the conductor rather than extending left to right. And performers must be alert not to go over the edge! The orchestra is visible in some shots to good effect, providing relief from the minimalist stage set.

The cast of eight may be considered six Germans and two Koreans, all coached to sing in Spanish. Judas is sung by Friedmann Kunder (I'd say, in his fifties, a big man with lots of white hair, probably violating your image of Judas). Kunder, either accidentally or at his request, is omitted from the Biographies. Jorg Sabrowski (Lazarus) communicates as actor, while the two sopranos just go through the motions. The singers appearing as the four guards later double as four apostles, so don't get confused.

MUSIC AND LIBRETTO

Halffter's tonal music is elaborately, but not grossly, orchestrated. He says he spent three days orchestrating 14 seconds of music. Marset's libretto includes his directions for stage design, business, and lighting, mostly ignored by the director (a theatrical tradition). Marset says he might write a scene of some length, only to cut it down in accord with the composer's concept of proportions.

Costumes and the multipurpose set are contemporary-simplistic, lacking any biblical aura, with the exception of the white table (not specified in the libretto):

THE STORY

At rise, there is the deserted table of the Last Supper, covered with an immaculate white cloth, at the center a pewter goblet and a round, gouged bread loaf, the common dining chairs in disarray around it. (The libretto calls for the Garden of Gethsemane.) [The long table, appearing only in Scene I, finally tips forward 90 degrees, everything remaining glued in place, and is slowly hoisted into the flies, making way for the square platform used throughout.]

Depressed, stunned, Lazarus circles the table, even sitting briefly in the chair of Jesus. Three guards appear, don wide leather belts, cloth helmets, and grab the long-pole weapons. They are briefly frightened by the ""ghost"" Lazarus, and call for their leader Malchus. The four realize that Lazarus is the one revivified by Jesus and attempt to seize him, like the apostles they are pursuing. Judas rushes on, declaring his bargain was only to turn over Jesus, all others to go free.

Lazarus escapes to his house shared with his sisters Martha and Mary (wearing the only wig in this production), in nearby Bethany. They minister to him, and believe that Judas is not really a betrayer but has a plan to rally popular support, get the Sanhedrin to back down, so that Jesus can lead the New Jerusalem.

Still fearing death, Lazarus goes to his crypt to hide. He dreams he is dead in the arms of his sisters (shown as a blurry back projection), who are then startled to see again Lazarus alive. He dreams he sees the sleeping apostles Simon, Andrew, John, and Jacob. He urges them to wake up and be gone.

The next day Judas goes to the four apostles. Yes, he betrayed Jesus, he admits, but he was but a tool in Jesus' destiny (thirty pieces of silver are not mentioned). Judas tells Simon that he is renamed Peter as the cornerstone of the New Jerusalem. Simon assents, but Judas departs coldly rejected.

Scene V is called The Exile (why?) in the libretto. At Lazarus' house Mary and two disciples set out for Jerusalem to be close to condemned Jesus. An apostle goes to tell the others to leave their hiding place. Lazarus feels all should forgive their betrayers and their pursuers. He returns to the crypt, unafraid: ""I wish only to die again, but this time awake,"" he tells Martha. When the guards close in (repeating a portion of the lines from Scene I, as if progress has been circuitous, or outside of time), Lazarus rises and walks unresisting toward the inevitable, as Jesus did from Gethsemane.

[The libretto calls for projections of a half dozen Old Master paintings showing martyrdom of apostles-saints. A feeble attempt or two do appear near the end of the opera, as well as a brief silhouette of the hanged Judas. An inspiration for the opera is Plato's story of the prisoners in the cave, the mundane reality we experience, and the ultimate reality too bright for mortals to look upon.

SUMMING UP

I think the music is ingenious, the libretto sometimes prosaic and determined to avoid drama as if it's coarse, some singing workaday, the physical production rather low-budget. I confess, for me contemporary opera peaked with Peter Grimes.",1276473600,8,5268,4.92108229988726
