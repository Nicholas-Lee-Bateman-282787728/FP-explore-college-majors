8694891,3,B00RCYDMCA,"This is the Top Gear special that had to be called off due to local problems. To wit, an outburst of violence by some sort of rabble rousing Argentinian Falklands War veterans group and seeming young, bored, unemployed and easily led local lads. But all that kerfuffle happens at the end of the show. So, to start at the beginning as it were;

# This special sees the lads all grabbing a V8 car and reporting to a lovely inland town in Argentina blessed with gorgeous mountain vistas. Richard has a beast of a yank tank muscle car. Jeremy takes a Porsche and James turns up in a Lotus(!).
# All three then have to head to the house where Butch Cassidy lived at one point. Which sends Jeremy in particular into raptures.
# They then head south to the bottom of South America with the target of Ushuaia with the intention of playing a game of car soccer with locals.
# The usual shenanigans are partaken of on the way south, the lads spending time in both Chile and Argentina and finally using a ferry to move the cars from one point to another in the channels at the bottom of South America.
# Then, when they are getting near their destination they end up holed up in a hotel room with angry Argies stalking the lobby area of the hotel and checking out the various vehicles. Finally a meeting occurs between the head of the veterans group and the producers and the upshot is that they are effectively ordered out of Argentina on the threat of trouble. Despite the fact that Argentine police were called to attend to the situation.
# The final part of the show is given over to showing the crew leaving in convoy and at one point having to run the gauntlet of rocks and other projectiles from obviously semi-organised groups of men who could not be old enough to be actual Falklands War veterans.

And thats the end of the show pretty much. It certainly shows that in some economically less well off parts of the world people cling to such issues. It also means that the program running time is shorter than a normal Top Gear Special usually ran to by this stage. So they have beefed it up with giving an enlarged version of the Australian drive they did as part of the last series ever done with Hammond, Clarkson and May. This is a nice enough piece and given much of the footage in it wasn't used as part of the segment in the series it is worthwhile for the Top Gear anorak.

So why only three stars? Well, to tell the truth the idiotic set ups are boring at this point. The oh were lost so have to drive through this marsh gambit, the whole Oh well have to ride these horses into town for whatever reason and the well have to modify our cars routine are all overplayed, tedious and not really all that amusing or entertaining anymore. Theyd be better off just getting on with it. Not to mention the personalities in the show are generally so utterly set in concrete with so little wriggle room for change even the interplay is getting repetitive. Its lost its freshness.

8694892,3,B00RCYDMCA,"One of the earlier specials Top Gear put out on DVD as a stand alone release this sees the lads - James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson going from Florida to Louisiana in three bangers they pick up for less than US$1000. There are a number of challenges along the way, one involving a simple time trial where the cars are driven by 'The Stigs American Cousin' and one rather tasteless segment where they look at road kill as an eating option.

Basically those familiar with the UK franchise of Top Gear will know they are going to get lots of jokes at the presenters expense, some car silliness, some teasing of the host country and it is fair to say the guys are a little harsher on the US here (back in the days before they were making any serious cash from US release of their shows) than they are in later series. Speaking of comparisons of earlier and later Top Gear product it is interesting how subdued the guys are - as the franchise went on the gradually super-sized their personalities to epic levels but here the expansiveness (and predictability of the foibles and arguments) is far less. Compare this to, say, their African Adventure where they went in search of the source of the Nile River.

Whatever the case of all that the guys end up in Louisiana shortly after the Katrina natural disaster and end up giving their cars away. Apart from James May who apparently couldn't even give away the Cadillac he'd bought.

One of the lesser lights of the various specials Top Gear UK produced this is never-the-less worthwhile viewing for fans of the series.",1438992000,,1575,4.578014184397163
