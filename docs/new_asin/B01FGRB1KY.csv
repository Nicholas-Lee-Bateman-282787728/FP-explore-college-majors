8760753,5,B01FGRB1KY,"This film is the culmination of John Ford's considerable silent film period (something like four dozen westerns alone). It's an excellent and entertaining movie, tremendously augmented by a newly composed, folksy music track. The Blu-ray version has quite good image quality, given the age of the film. The acting, and script, are more subtle than I expected (referring to the matrimonial potential of an obviously gay character, one of the trio says that if his heart's in the right place, it doesn't matter what sex he is).  The action sequences are sometimes compelling; although mostly shot with a static camera, there is a pan across the wagons lined up for a land rush that is staggering (that shot alone reveals why the film lost money). The ending was touching, but I thought it could have been much more so with a bit more character development; apparently, that's  what the studio excised, against Ford's wishes. The film teeters on the edge of being a masterpiece but falls short, and the hammy acting of the main villain made that inevitable. None-the-less, this is one of the most enjoyable silent films I've seen in years.",1503705600,,1136,4.911458333333333
8760754,4,B01FGRB1KY,John Ford loved Westerns. Due to the huge success of James Cruze's THE COVERED WAGON in 1923 studios began to make epic Westerns. William Fox had great success with THE IRON HORSE with Ford directing so in 1926 gave him a big budget to make 3 BAD MEN. Ford was displeased that the studio recut the film after its trial runs and the film failed to live up to the box-office success of the two earlier epics. There's plenty to enjoy in what would be Ford's last Western until 1939's STAGECOACH. Great character acting and spectacular land rush scenes are the high light of this piece. Though I already had the film on DVD I chose to get the Blu-ray versions mainly due to Joseph McBride's commentary track which is new for this release. McBride's commentary is outstanding. The film itself does look better in Blu-ray but comes from a surviving print that has scratches. If you have a interest in the works of John Ford then this would a must.,1489536000,3,941,4.508771929824562
8760755,4,B01FGRB1KY,"Very good John Ford-directed silent film based on the Oklahoma land rush, which is along the line of Ford's 3 Godfathers. However, this time the 3 Bad Men act as guardian angels for a young man and a young woman, actors who were lovers in real life. Fine group of actors. I had no idea that the George O'Brien of John Wayne/Ford films was a war hero and a gorgeous matinee idol in his youth. He is the juvenile make lead in this film. I loved the music score that was subsequently added much later to the film.",1481241600,2,510,4.214285714285714

8760757,4,B01FGRB1KY,"3 Bad Men is an early one from director John Ford. Frankly, I don't admire him as much as some others, most of his films are bloated pieces devoted to the celebration of the ""white man"" at the expense of Native American Indian tribes.

George O'Brien is in this one, who did about 100 quick films, most of them being sloppy drivel, some he did later with director John Ford.

This one is about three outlaws who attempt to redeems themselves by helping some girl.

It's not bad for the standard.",1472342400,4,495,4.417582417582418
