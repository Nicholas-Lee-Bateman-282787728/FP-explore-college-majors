8454457,4,B0052TXWJ0,"I have always been a fan of Brule and while I don't like the steel flute playing, at least I know why his daughter doesn't play a wooden one.  Who knew it was not allowed for women to play the wooden flute???

The one thing that did annoy me some was the irritating reverberation that was there during the concert.  I don't know if this was deliberate or not, but it was very irritating.  Other than that it was a good concert.  I did miss Moses Brings Plenty on the drums, I love to watch that flowing hair moving in the breeze",1353801600,2,528,4.137254901960785
