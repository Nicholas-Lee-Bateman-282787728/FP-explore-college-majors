357133,5,6301744136,"""Short Circuit"" has been one of my favorite comedies since I first saw it. Now there is a wondrful DVD version with great ""bonus features"". The ""making of"" and ""behind the scenes"" are a bit disappointing because they are so short, but the interviews with the stars, director and tech people are great. It is worth having the DVD just for the track with comments by the director and authors.
The film itself is a delightful modern day fantasy. Yes, the computers and such items do show the age of this 1986 film, but do not take away from the great story. Any film that can make you fall in love with a piece of machinery and care about what happens to it is a wonder. Number 5 is a real character with an endearing personality. This is true cinema magic. But, this could never have happened without truly wonderful performances by Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg. Their belief in #5 draws the viewer into the story and makes you believe too. One false move from them and the film could have fallen apart. Fisher Stevens gives a comic gem of a performance as the Indian character who has trouble with the English language. On the ""bonus track"" John Badham, the director, states that many of the most humerous line were invented on the spot by Mr. Stevens.
Even the ""villians"" are not really evil, just over zealous in carrying out their jobs. Yes, you ""hate"" them because you've come to care so much for #5 and cheer when they are outsmarted, but that is part of the fun of this film.
To summon it up, get your popcorn, soft drink and other munchies, put this little gem in your DVD and have a really fun time.",984873600,,1610,4.424242424242424

""Hey, Laser lips, your momma was a snow blower"" :) Anyways, I thought that this DVD being a special edition and all would have some really great features; well, I was disappointed. The featurettes are extremely old, which were filmed around the same time the film was made. The only thing new is the commentary track. Regardless, if you like this movie, buy the disc.

357137,4,6301744136,"""Short Circuit"" is classic memory in my mind. The film is all about the funny cute robot known as, Johnny 5. Also known as #5, the film takes place with #5 getting hit by lightning and escaping a military show  of new army robotics. While #5 stumbles on the homely Stephanie (Ally  Sheedy) she believes he is a alien, but when she see's his trademark on his  back she calls the company, then everything breaks loose as this top-secret  military machine with a lovable personality may be Public Enemy #1.

 He escapes the compound and is befriended by a ditzy mobile caterer (Ally Sheedy.)

Here is how it goes:
She mistakes the robot for an alien.
He learns what it is to be alive.
Security wants it dismantled before it takes their place.
However we know ""it just runs programs"" (yah right)

Will Ally discover her mistake?
Will the robot survive or be disassembled?
Can they recover it before it blows something up?

358412,1,6301744136,"I thought we were done with aspect ratio nonsense, but in 2016, CINEDIGM decided to release Short Circuit on DVD in a shrunken widescreen format that has black bars on the sides. It looks somewhat normal after I switch to the ""zoom"" picture mode on my TV, but it looks slightly stretched out, which bugs me to no end. The menu looks cheap, like it was put together by somebody's cousin instead of a legitimate distribution company. Finally, there aren't any extras, not even a trailer or subtitles. All you get is a choice between Dolby Digital 5.1 or 2.0 and chapter selection.

358611,4,6301744136,"We watched this over and over as children.

The plot can be gained from any number of websites or Amazon reviews. What I wanted to add is that in my opinion this film is FINE for children.
No, I don't mean three or five year olds, but that's because full-length non-animated feature films are frequently too complex and too not-punchy for them to sit through.
But for your seven-and-ups...that's how old my brother and sister were when we would watch this, and I saw it too pretty young ( I was born in the late 70's and I saw this when it was released to VHS). Man, we weren't THAT different then. It's not comparing children of the 1780's to those of the 1980's. An occasional 'damn' thrown into the middle of the sentence or as an aside ruined no one I know. None of us are in therapy because the G-men chasing Elliott in 'ET' had guns.
When I was a child, the DISNEY CHANNEL aired 'Jaws', 'Ghostbusters' and so on. At night, after seven or eight, yeah, but still. Nowadays you barely see anyone furrowing their brow at another character, let alone eating anyone alive. I assure you I am not emotionally crippled and was not afraid of water (or sharks; I find sharks things of terrible beauty and did as a child too).
It is rated PG for small amounts of VERY mild violence (the robots are military projects and thus can blow tanks and stuff up, but no people are blown up, an angry boyfriend tries to hit the robot, etc)and for a little language (nothing too salty by today's standards for sure).
I have seen some reviews saying ultra-religious people will object to exposing their family to the language but...seriously.
If you're ultra-religious you won't watch this anyway because you would also find the premise that the machine has acquired a soul, is a person and deserves to be treated like a human life objectionable.
We were not damaged by this film, and we saw it dozens of times. We are now business owners, nurses, and conscientious Marines.
If anything, films like this are capable of subtly teaching children ( it is not preachy) that those who don't look like we do are still walking the same road we are, that friends are to be had in all shapes and sizes, that violence is not the answer to your problems, and the folly of 'hating on' what you don't understand before you even bother to find out what is really going on.

I still watch this film occasionally. Some of it is dated... pop culture references No. 5 is soaking up are a trip, and the Indian scientist is a stereotype festival being played by, weirdly, an in-real-life very pale non-Indian  actor (though rest assured he is a good person and comes across as someone you'd want to befriend)...but it holds up well enough, will entertain and morally educate kids despite the mild expletives, and is worth you checking out, especially at such a low price!",1463443200,,2833,4.540117416829745
358612,5,6301744136,"Short Circuit -My favorite movie! I love Johnny 5. I had this movie on repeatedly when I lived alone in my apartment. I love the sound of the laughter from Johnny 5. The special effects are amazing for 1986. Also Short Circuit II states in the credits that there was a human voice for Johnny 5. I am wondering whether there was actual AI in 1986 and what Johnny 5 is up to now. For example Koko the gorilla, who became famous for caring for a kitten in the 1985 National Geographic, has an extensive sign language vocabulary and probably can use the internet!

It is possible that Johnny 5 is real. Also the Super Computer at University of California San Diego, I wonder what it is up to these days. I find humans to be rejecting similar to the experience Johnny 5 had. I'm excited about repurchasing this video. I guess the Google staff is shelling out $301 to own the multi-media format. The casting directors also casted Steve Guttenburg in Cocoon, another movie I enjoy",1462924800,,973,4.497175141242938

358964,4,6301744136,"Government contractor Nova Enterprises is in the midst of a demonstration of its five new robots--all armed with lasers that can ""kill"" even a tank--when a sudden thundersquall results in Robot #5 being hit by lightning.  Rendered self-aware by its scrambled programming, #5 slips off the campus in a garbage truck and ends up in a lunch wagon owned by Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), whose cottage in semi-rural Oregon is overrun with the animals she loves--a ferret, a skunk, a small flock of geese, a three-legged dog, and countless kittens, to name a few.  Stephanie at first thinks she's being contacted by an alien, but when she realizes otherwise, she contacts Nova (a company she considers a warmonger), and project manager Howard Marner (Austin Pendleton) sends #5's programmers, Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens), out to collect the errant 'bot.  But before they can get there, #5 begins demonstrating his true abilities: by ""watching"" Stephanie's TV and high-speed-scanning every book in her house, he absorbs not only the English language (which he promptly begins to speak) but stacks of information about the world around him--including the concept of ""deactivation.""  He teaches himself to cook (not very well: he doesn't know you're supposed to crack eggs before adding them to batter), disco-dance, and even drive.  Before long Stephanie has bonded with him and they're both on the run from not only Newton and Ben but Nova's security chief, Skroeder (G. W. Bailey), and Stephanie's ex, Frank (Brian McNamara), who's eager to claim the reward Nova is offering for its property.  But #5, as Newton eventually realizes, isn't anyone's property any more, except his own...

Whether you'd call this movie science fiction or comedy-drama I'm not sure, but either way it's a delight--far better than I had really hoped.  #5 is a charming automaton who'll worm his way into your heart as surely as he does into Stephanie's; kids and adults alike should like him, as they did E.T.  Yet despite the fantastic premise, everything seems logical and plausible.  As a little extra, cat-lovers will be charmed by the kittens that keep dropping (or perhaps dripping) off Stephanie's shelves and popping onto countertops.",1452729600,,2254,5.167582417582418

359550,4,6301744136,"The quickest way I can describe this movie is did you like E.T. The Extra Terrestrial? Then you will likely enjoy Short Circuit. It's a pretty similar film in that a sci-fi character is lost in the world and a human befriends him. While E.T. is more a family drama with comedic elements Short Circuit is a straight up, 100% comedy. Cute gags and a little subversive humor all tied up in an 80's package are the name of the game, and the fact you get a cool robot in the mix only makes it that much better.

Short Circuit is about a prototype military robot (Number 5) made by Nova Labs who gets a massive power surge that scrambles its programming. Number 5 wanders outside the Nova Labs compound and befriends Stephanie (Ally Sheedy). In the mean time Number 5's designer, Dr. Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) is trying to find it so he can study what happened. At the same time the Nova Labs security force sees Number 5 as a threat to the local community and is intent to destroy it. So now Number 5 must avoid getting obliterated while at the same time convince Dr. Crosby he is no longer a machine and is in fact alive.

The movie's premise and plot are all there to support the one main aspect of this film. Number 5 and his antics. This robot is undoubtedly the star of the film. The funniest lines, the best scenes and all attention is on Number 5. This actually works in the movie's favor. This robot is a cool design and is realistic in form and function. When you see the robot in action you would swear it's a real robot. That's a cool thing to say in a time when there were tons of robot movies with not a lot of realistic ones. What's more is Number 5 was given enough articulation to show varying emotions, which is a big plus.

So the story isn't that important other than to put Number 5 into various situations. The movie opens a strong origin with the emotionless prototypes doing their thing. Then Number 5 has his own adventure looking at a world it never knew before and craving to know more. The conflicts put in the movie actually make sense. Instead of just having a military wanting to waste the robot to cover up a mistake or something like that the security chief (played by G. W. Bailey) brings up some very good points on why they need to neutralize it. What he sees is a malfunctioning robot armed with a laser powerful enough to stop a tank rampaging among the civilian population. Of course Number 5 is self aware, and with that it doesn't want to hurt anybody. This is where its need to contact its creator comes into play. Again this is all really just to move the plot forward while you hear the jokes and see the pratfalls.

This being made in 1986 there are some very 80's style tropes in this film. You will find a few nonsensical and pointless footage here and there that were a reflection of the times. Also the human stars of the film seem to be just there because of their popularity at the time. Steve Guttenberg is definitely not the right guy for the role of geeky scientist. They try to make him sound like he's lacking in social skills, but that doesn't come off at all. Guttenberg is a charismatic actor, and doesn't have the chops to dial that down enough to convince me he never kissed a girl or is out of touch with the outside world. Ally Sheedy is only mildly out of place in this film. She plays what I call a stereotypical bubbly and sweet girl-next-door character, and she pulls it off. The only problem is it doesn't feel like much a stretch for the character. I still see characteristics from her roles in films like The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo's Fire pop up. Fisher Stevens plays Newton's Indian assistant, Ben Jabituya, and while the character is funny it's borderline racist. Although not because Jabutuya does stereotypical Indian things. On the contrary the worst stereotype is his mixing of the English language, which is still kinda funny. The borderline racist part is an American actor playing the character instead of somebody with an Indian background.

I did relate this film to E.T., but only by the plot similarities. It's a very different film. Where E.T. was cute Number 5 is charming. Where E.T. was heartwarming Short Circuit is fun. Also Short Circuit has a good deal more adult themes as well including more profanity and sexually suggestive humor. Not that you shouldn't let your kids watch the film, but I want to make sure your expectations are set accordingly. Tweens and teens should have not much trouble dealing with the off-color aspects of the film.

The Blu-Ray is... well better than the DVD. The video quality is still technically in high definition and you will see a lot more details than on any previous release, but the level of contrast and color seem to fluctuate. I know the Blu-Ray was actually mastered in 1080i instead of 1080p (this makes a difference as ""i"" means interlaced lines of resolution instead of the full progressive scan), but that can't really account for the fluctuations. I don't know if it's because the source material was filmed with different reels not in sequence or if the transfer simply came from various sources. Either way the visuals can be off-puting if you are really looking for it. Although I don't think our average viewer will really notice it that much. Audio is more consistent DTS HD Master, and the surround sound elements do a lot to get you immersed in the film. It's not a reference audio kind of film, but audio will not disappoint. The extras are exactly the same as what is on the Special Edition DVD. The end credits allude to scenes that were filmed but never added to the movie. It's a shame they were compiled on a deleted scenes clip or put in an Extended Edition version of the movie. Still there's an impressive amount of features for a budget film release.

Audio Commentary  - Director John Badham and writers Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson make up the commentary. Most of the commentary is about getting Number 5 to come through effectively on the screen. It's a run commentary.

Cast Interviews - Lots of interviews at about an hour long combined. The actors, director, special effects crew and even conceptual artist Syd Mead are all on board giving you a lot of details. Most of it is about the robot. Like I said... this movie is all about Number 5. There is a fair amount of repetition between interviews, but it's still probably the most informative featurette on the disc.

The Creation of Number-5 - It's a relatively quick promotional video made back in the day to market the release of Short Circuit. It goes into designing Number 5 and what it took to get it to work on film.

Isolated Music and Effects - You can see the entire film without the dialog. Make a game of it. Dub your own script in.

Behind-the-Scenes Featurette - Short but sweet. Has behind the scenes footage of the cast in crew in action.

Press Kit  - This is a catch all supplement with movie trailers, production notes, photo gallery and cast biographies. I believe these are the same extras that came on the original, non-Special Edition DVD.

It's an 80's film. It's a fun film. You will see a lot of ""Wall-E"" in this movie. If you are a fan of robots, sci-fi or real, this is a must watch film. Number 5 is an iconic science fiction robot so really any sci-fi fan should put this on their to do list as well. It's a character comedy so if you're into that you will also find something to like here. Short Circuit is a light, but dated comedy, that still has the chops to entertain.",1423440000,,7523,4.493050475493782

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `Short Circuit' was a modest hit upon its release in the summer of 1986. The picture grossed around $40 million in the U.S. and Canada alone on a budget of probably around one-quarter that amount. It spawned a much less, but enjoyable successful sequel and, rather surprisingly, is considered big enough commodities today that the remake rights were snapped up by Dimension Films and with this 2014 remastered Blu-ray upgrade, giving it a new lease of life for a whole new audience.

Though director John Badham's earlier film was `WarGames' [1983], which now looks so out of date and embarrassing, which also featured actress Ally Sheedy, and watching this upgraded 2014 Blu-ray release of `Short Circuit' via the IMAGE Entertainment studio was an eye opening experience and a vast improvement over the original Blu-ray disc release. Watching it was a real 1980s flashback and viewers of my generation will thrill to see it all over again and is an enjoyable romp.

The film opens with the demonstration of five seemingly unstoppable prototype robots intended for battlefield use (though more of an arms race deterrent against the Soviet Union), on the grounds of Nova Laboratories in Washington State. A bolt of lightning results in a massive power surge in robot Number 5; it begins behaving eccentrically and inadvertently it's taken outside the laboratory grounds and unwittingly abandoned several miles away.

Now inexplicably sentient, ""Number Five is Alive"" (so it proclaims later on) and the cute, curious robot begins exploring the countryside, eventually making its way to the Astoria, Oregon, home of Stephanie Speck [Ally Sheedy], a single woman who drives a lunch wagon (not an ice cream van, as others have suggested) and has a soft spot for stray animals. At first she thinks Number Five (voiced by Tim Blaney, one of its puppeteers) is an extra-terrestrial, and then is disappointed to find that it's merely a product of the military, then is taken with it again because of its childlike insatiable thirst for knowledge. (""Need input! Need input!"" it cries.) Stephanie Speck obliges it with volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which in an amusing scene it uploads in a matter of minutes.

Meanwhile, back at the lab, frantic director Howard Marner [Austin Pendleton] dispatches programmer Newton Crosby [Steve Guttenberg] and an outrageous and not very 2014 pc typical Asian Indian stereotype Ben Jabituya [Fisher Stevens] to retrieve Number Five before it kills somebody with its deadly laser arsenal. At the same time, trigger-happy head of security Skroeder [G.W. Bailey] is chomping at the bit to blow Number Five to smithereens.

Though its cute anthropomorphic robot is obviously an homage to E.T. `Short Circuit' most closely resembles earlier live action Disney comedies of the late-1950s and early '60s, pictures like `The Absent-Minded Professor,' `Moon Pilot' and `Son of Flubber.' Those films dealt with science-fictional concepts, often gently satirised the military and other institutions, featured nebbish scientists and leading ladies whose romantic rivals were brutish buffoons, offered cute animals in supporting parts, and so on. All of these elements come into play here and there's even a three-legged mutt named Beasley and like the Disney sci-fi / fantasy comedies this is rife with imaginative and comical special effects. But it's also a high concept 1980s comedy so there's endless product placement, hilariously gratuitous mild swearing to ensure a PG rating, myriad pop culture reference, a very 1980s theme song (""Who's Johnny,"" performed by El DeBarge), a Brat Pack star, and that icon of mindless 1980s comedies, the inimitable Steve Guttenberg.

Number Five, largely the creation of Syd Mead and Eric Allard, seems patterned after the less anthropomorphic robots from Gog [1954], a forgotten 1950s sci-fi film with a vaguely similar story. The character is almost lovable in its early scenes; its unfettered joy of discovery is infectious, and for a bunch of nuts and bolts, it's surprisingly expressive. Later though, after Number Five has consumed hours and hours of pop culture watching TV, he gradually becomes annoying instead of endearing, something like a geek at a sci-fi convention who incessantly quotes reams of dialogue from TV commercials, old George Raft films, and the Three Stooges shorts.

One aspect of the film that didn't seem to bother contemporary reviewers with its release in 1986 is the difficult to 2014 today's image today is Fisher Stevens' malapropism-prone (""With excitement like this who needs enemas?"") Indian stereotype, the kind of thickly-accented sidekick role Pedro Gonzalez Gonzales used to excel at. At least Gonzalez Gonzales was really Mexican; I thought such virtual blackface performances went out with the 20th Century.

If you break the film down into its separate elements it shouldn't really work, especially when viewed a quarter of a century after it first came out. Despite their likeable screen personalities, Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy's performances are so so, with Steve Guttenberg riding on the wave of his Police Academy fame but not giving (or being allowed to give) enough of that wise-guy personality and remaining fairly bland. Ally Sheedy is a little more animated with her performance.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Short Circuit' was filmed in Panavision and processed by Technicolor, with theatrical prints by Metrocolor. The 1080p encoded image, plus the 2.40:1 video aspect is a pleasant outstanding image with this 2014 Blu-ray upgrade. It's a good presentation and the visual aspect of the film was quite impressive and helped by Pacific Northwest locations where the filmmakers obviously had to contend with frequently overcast skies and lots of rain. But the image is sharp and detailed; on Blu-ray it's easy the marionette-style wires that occasionally manipulate some of the robots' movements, and there's an audacious traveling matte shot easily spotted freeze-frame near the beginning trying to darken some background skies.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The audio, originally standard Dolby Stereo, is typical of its period: comparatively weak centred dialogue with stronger music and effects tracks. For this 2014 Blu-ray release it has been remixed to a stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. The end results are still pretty comparable to what the presentation would've have been like in a good Dolby film cinema circa 1986 release. Optional English and Spanish subtitles are included.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director John Badham and Writers S.S. Wilson and Brant Maddock: This commentary track has  director John Badham and writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock. An enjoyable listen but an ultimately standard commentary track, this trio provides some interesting insights into the making of the movie, from filming the opening credits scene to fake flowers used in lieu of real ones, to the reasoning behind making the Ally Sheedy character an animal lover, and to filming in northern Oregon. This track flows effortlessly and I'm sure fans of this film will be delighted to spend over 99 minutes with these participants.

Isolated Music and Effects Track: Allows the viewer to watch the entire movie with only these two components intact. I'm never sure if anyone actually uses features like this one, but its presence must please someone out there?

Special Feature: The Creation of Number 5 [1986] [480i] [4:3] [6:46] Is a retro feature with interviews with John Badham and some members of the effects crew. There is a look at the advanced robotics seen in the film and the arduous process of making the robots looks just as the director wanted.

Special Feature: Cast and Crew Video Interviews [1986] [480i] [4:3] [59:00] A series of interviews with Ally Sheedy [480p] [2:18], Steve Guttenberg [480p] [2:24] , John Badham [480p] [2:06], Syd Mead [480p] [17:36], and Eric Allard [480p] [35:02]. The most significant chunk of material included on this release comes in the form of five interviews with actors Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg, director John Badham, robotics designer Syd Mead, and special effects supervisor Eric Allard. It gets a bit repetitive since 80% of the time is devoted to the practical creation of Number-5, but it's a lengthy supplement that covers a lot of ground.

Special Feature: Behind-the-Scene Footage [1986] [480i] [4:3] [3:00] This brief glimpse behind-the-scenes, looks into a handful of scenes, explores the film's on-set atmosphere, and shows the chemistry between the cast members.

Promotional Photo Gallery [480i] [4:3] Here we get lots of a still image of the robots and behind the scene gallery. The photos are interesting, but perversely reduced in size to about one-sixth the size of your TV screen.

Biographies [480i] [4:3] Here we have text-based biographies of Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, John Badham, S.S. Wilson, Bent Maddock, Syd Mead and Eric Allard.

Robot and Promotional Design Still Gallery [480i] [4:3] Text-based production notes derived from the original 1986 press kit.

Original Theatre Trailer [1986] [480i] [4:3] [1:50] The tatty looking trailer must've been taken from an old composite tape source and is a candidate for the worst-looking trailer on Blu-ray so far: it's full frame and looks flat-out awful.

Finally, So overall, this release of `Short Circuit' is a fun nostalgia trip for those of us who remember it the first time round, only with a cleaner picture and a better understanding of the jokes. If you've never seen it before it might not have the same effect but nevertheless it is still an enjoyable comedy and worthy of your time. It falls slightly short of era-defining in the same way as `Back to the Future' or `The Goonies' but coming from a time when Steven Spielberg ruled the roost with these types of films it more than holds its own, and as the press release says, ""it's a perfect gift for all ages."" When I saw this film original release in 1986, I fell in love with it and with this 2014 re-release, it brings back the magic on why I loved this film and despite its 80's style of presentation, I personally feel it holds up well and loved all of it 99 minutes and the extras were quite informative, but sadly some of the features were very lacking in sparkling image, in fact I feel they were very lazy in not upgrading the images of the special features and the biggest gripe is the bog standard film trailer is the worst I have ever seen and should of not been included, as it was a total embarrassment. But despite the last comment, I am really pleased to add this to my Blu-ray Collection and cannot wait to get the follow up `Short Circuit 2' Blu-ray disc, despite a lot of negative reviews I have read. Highly Recommended!

360190,3,6301744136,"This review has nothing to do with the movie itself, but the terrible formatting of the Standard DVD version of this film.

The description claims that it is ""widescreen,"" but when you insert the disc, it is still 4:3 format with black bars on the side and bottom. This really angered me, but the movie was so cheap, it would just be a hassle to return it.

There is a sort of fix that makes it close to true widescreen, thankfully. Most TVs now come with a way to change the aspect ratio of your display. I found that by using my remote to change the resolution, it filled the TV and with no black bars (the only downside is the loss of quality, but it's not extremely noticeable).

I hope this helps anyone looking to buy the standard DVD version of this movie.
Other than that, the movie is a classic and I'm glad to have it in my 80's movie collection; and if it weren't for the lazy formatting, this review would have a much higher rating.",1398384000,2,944,4.262569832402234

Johnny 5 is one of the most notable characters post-industrial revolution. His bubbly sense of humor combined with his razor sharp wit create the perfect storm for a memorable and epic gold screen performance. He can be credited with single-handedly winning the cold war and ensuring those pesky communists were kept at bay. Johnny 5 has been described as the ""Normal Rockwell"" of our generation, and his on screen chemistry with Ally Sheedy rivals even Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet from Titanic. This movie will literally change your life and give you a different perspective on everything from doing laundry to pumping iron at the gym. If only the government would invest money into Nova Robotics instead of fixing our pesky social problems, we would truly be that great nation on a hill that our founding fathers spoke of.

360744,4,6301744136,"Definitely a cult classic.  Many great lines.  Very funny, and very enjoyable.  Yes, and even sad, at times, but with a good ending.",1375142400,,132,4.6521739130434785
360745,4,6301744136,"I credit two films in particular with endearing me toward robots and robot movies.  One would be the original ""Star Wars,"" with its lovable duo of R2D2 and C3P0.  The other would be a certain cult-classic film with an adorable malfunctioning robot... ""Short Circuit.""  These movies didn't just show off their technical prowess by creating robots that looked like actual robots instead of cheap puppets, but they imbued them with personality, making them every bit as three-dimensional and personable as the human actors... and oftentimes more likable.

While ""Short Circuit"" isn't a cinematic classic like ""Star Wars"" and its accompanying franchise, it's a fun and cute movie in its own right.  And its robot character is a lot of fun.

Number Five is one of a set of prototype robots developed by Newton, a reclusive scientist, for use on the battlefield.  A lightning strike scrambles Number Five's circuits and gives him something his fellow prototypes don't have... a personality, and a sense of truly being alive.  He escapes the laboratory, causing a panic among the scientists and military when they realize he's still armed with a powerful laser.  Number Five eventually ends up in the care of Stephanie, a feisty animal-loving caterer who first mistakes him for an alien, but comes to realize that even if he's manmade he's still sentient.  But with the military desperate to stop Number Five at any cost, even if it means destroying him, Stephanie must convince Newton that Number Five is truly alive before the unthinkable happens.

While the special effects of this film might look somewhat cheesy today, they were quite good for their time.  And in a way, using puppetry and real robots for this film give it a sense of realism that modern CGI just can't duplicate.  Number Five manages to be quite expressive, communicating his emotions and thoughts via posture, eye color, and a rather mobile set of ""eyebrows.""

The acting in this film, while not spectacular, is decent enough that I never felt jarred out of the movie by a bad acting job.  Steve Gutenberg and Ally Sheedy are rather good as Newton and Stephanie respectively, and to this day I have a hard time seeing them as anything besides Newton and Stephanie.  They actually have a decent on-screen chemistry, and while Gutenberg can get goofy at times, it's understandable given that his character is more comfortable around robots than people.  GW Bailey hams it up as Skroeder, the military officer who wants Number Five dead, and while Fisher Stevens has raised some controversy as Ben (the actor is white while the character is Indian), he was fun and hilarious in my opinion.

Warning for parents -- this film has some mild profanity and a few genuinely scary moments, including a ""war game"" scene in the beginning and a couple of shootouts.  Parents might want to screen this movie before letting their children watch, as every child's tolerance level for on-screen action violence is different.

By turns cute, exciting, and hilarious, ""Short Circuit"" is a must-see for fans of '80s cinema, and anyone who enjoys a good robot movie.  Recommended for ages 10 and up.",1375056000,,3145,4.94106463878327

361009,4,6301744136,"This should be a suitable film for most but there are a number of  problems which would influence its acceptability for certain groups. It does not have subtitles for the hearing impaired. Happily, this is made in the old-fashioned way, all the speaking is articulated and given the volume to be understood by anyone who is not in the more serious categories of hearing impairment. Still in all, no  DVD made in recent decades should have been deficient in this respect. For some in  the potential audience, who are extremely conservative (in a social not political sense), the language will, on occasion, be over the line of propriety. I do not think this is true for the larger segment of the public but these people should be aware of the problem so as to avoid, what to them, is an impropriety. One reviewer mentions some language bothersome to their religious sensibilities, I did not notice this, but potential watcher beware.
For myself, it was a movie that, as they say, kids of all ages, could enjoy (with that pleasure, of course, diminishing in inverse proportion to their  actual age). It is the theme of Pinocchio. Wizard of Oz, and who knows how many other classic stories, becoming human through  the induction of certain characteristics. The robotetry (after puppetry and similar words) was quite well done, the good guys (and gal) suitably nice, and the villains suitably villainous. While much is simple minded slapstick, physical and verbal, as the use of the Three Stooges clips remind the adults watching, this is what kids get a kick out of .
At any rate, with the exceptions I point out, this is a young peoples movie which allows the adult to sit in without an eyeshade and ear plugs.",1365379200,3,1708,4.756756756756757

Now, if you don't mind foul language in front of your kids, then fire this movie right up.  The story is still reasonably good and entertaining (even though seeing the electronics of the day is quite amusing).  However, if you do mind bad language, let me tell you that it's chock full of bad language.  My wife and I ended up turning the movie off because of the language.  I really don't remember it being that bad.  Maybe I watched an edited version when I was a kid.

To make this review concise...
If your value system allows for you kids to be exposed to a lot of bad language, by all means, watch the movie.  It's fairly entertaining, even though it's old.

If your value system DOESN'T condone this kind of language, I'd steer far away from this.  There are many better options out there.",1350864000,,931,4.2988505747126435

361308,2,6301744136,"Almost all motion pictures are made to please the audience. A film needn't have a happy ending to be pleasing; people are looking for some form of emotional connection, and this can include (for example) a hero who dies in the process of achieving something worthwhile.

But it's rare to see a film that so obviously panders to the audience's desire for the superficially appealing as does ""Short Circuit"". It's coldly calculated to push all the right buttons.

In terms of acting, directing, & production values, ""Short Circuit"" is in no way a bad film. The two-star rating is for the way it so blatantly sucks up to the audience's desire for cheaply obtained emotional reactions.

""Short Circuit"" is strictly a kiddie film, with little of any real interest to adults.

The running commentary (by the director and writers) is one of those rarities -- a generally interesting narrative that largely avoids the self-congratulatory smugness and pointless anecdotes that mar too many commentaries. It is far superior to the film itself.

Technical Stuff... The image quality is generally good, though a bit softer than one gets from the very best BDs. There are one or two white specks here and there, but that's about it. The transfer, however, is at 1080i/30, rather than the preferred 1080p/24. This is hardly surprising, as Image Entertainment is the publisher.",1346371200,,1362,5.008849557522124

Sort of a modern-day Pinocchio story, the little metal boy turns real - real enough, at least, even if he stays little and metal. Maybe even real enough to get a kid to think about what it means to be a person with feelings, even if that person looks different. The self-aware robot's history as a piece of military hardware provides plenty of adventure, but it stays safe enough for all but the most skittish young'uns.

It doesn't hurt that the robot is cute, too. The film's makers specifically wanted to avoid anything that looked like a person might be inside, and succeeded beautifully. They came up with a wonderfully expressive gadget, sort of a marionette but with inivisible electronic controls instead of actual strings or wires. The result is a nice piece of technology, but with a real personality.

If you liked ""Batteries Not Included"" (and I did very much), give this one a shot. It's fun.

361652,3,6301744136,"I'll save any potential blu-ray customers the hassle and tell you right now that if you already have the special edition of Short Circuit on dvd, you might as well keep it, because this blu-ray isn't much of an upgrade at all. But for those who still haven't bought the movie, is this version worth buying on the superior format? Again, no. In fact, if you just plain want the movie and don't have to have all your movies on blu-ray, I recommend going with the dvd instead.

For those who didn't see it in the 80s, Short Circuit was a pretty big movie for its time. It's the story of Number Five, aka Johnny Five, a robot who was originally part of a line of military weapons, meant to turn the tide of war in our favor. But he was struck by lightning one day, and as a result, began to think for himself rather than follow orders to kill and destroy. He eventually meets a woman named Stephanie who helps Number Five develop a personality and shows him how people live. Number Five just wants input (any information available, be it in a book, on tv, etc.) and to live his life, but the military wants him back, as do his developers.

There isn't a whole lot to the movie itself, especially when you watch it now and don't let nostalgia blind you. While it is a pretty fun and cute comedy, it's hard to look past some things as being lame or borderline offensive. Fisher Stevens caked on the brown makeup and plays an Indian man here, and eventhough he did go to a dialect coach to learn how to 'speak Indian', I can see his role irking a lot of people. I thought he was funny as a kid, but now, why didn't they just go with a real Indian guy? And sadly, most of the scenes that don't have Number 5 are fairly boring. But when he's on-screen, it's impressive to see how much work was put into him, and seeing all the parts in his face and arms move, seeing that each item has a function. The message of the movie still holds up, like trying to teach a robot about life and death, and why things in the world are the way they are, even if there's no set reason for it. There's not much more to say about the movie other than if you've never seen it, and don't like movies from the 80s, you should pass. But for people looking to enjoy a robot comedy movie or are just nostalgic, give Short Circuit a shot, and definitely check out the sequel, since it did everything better.

Now here's the problem- the visual quality on the blu-ray is a mixed bag. Certain scenes look great while others are a mess. Just when a scene would look beautiful, everything would suddenly become grainy and dull, almost like it was taken from the vhs version. Don't expect much from the transfer here, and you should be fine. The audio though, is much better thanks to the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1. It's nothing that'll show off your home entertainment system, since the movie doesn't have a whole lot of explosions or gunfire, save for a few scenes, but it got much better treatment than the picture quality did.

Special features are fortunately back, after mysteriously vanishing from the second dvd release. The commentary track with the director and writers is here, and the guys do a good job of using their time to talk about technical details and fun stories on how they got the actors for their roles and why they went with some things, like having Stevens play an Indian man. They also talk about the trouble working with Number Five and the budget problems too. 'good commentary track here. Next is nearly an hour's worth of interviews with the cast and crew, though most of the time is spent talking about Number Five's development. Oddly enough, there's a featurette dedicated to the creation of Number 5 that runs under 10 minutes, and is hilarious to watch if only because of how 80s it is. An isolated music/sound effects track is on here as well, though I don't know why. This isn't exactly a movie that's known for either the music or sound effects, but I guess someone out there's been waiting for this. Finally are the Behind the Scenes (very short footage of people on the set/behind the cameras) and the press kit, which is just the trailer, photo gallery and bios and production notes. Overall the extras are good, but only for the die-hard fans of Short Circuit.

Once more, if you already have the special edition dvd, there's no reason to get Short Circuit on blu-ray unless you absolutely need all your movies on the format, or if you don't already have it and for some reason don't want the dvd. It's worth watching once if you haven't seen it, but the people who'll get the most out of it are those who still get something out of the more fun, zany movies from the 80s. You could do a lot worse than Short Circuit, that's for sure.",1278201600,6,4737,4.38452787258248

361702,3,6301744136,"In 1986, the film ""Short Circuit"" was released in theaters and made over $40 million domestically.  The film about a US military robot gone awol after an electrical surge and eventually developing a conscience attracted moviegoers.

The film is directed by John Badham (""WarGames"", ""Blue Thunder"", ""Point of No Return"") and a screenplay written by S.S. Wilson (""Wild Wild West"", ""Ghost Dad"", ""Tremors"") and Brent Maddock (""Wild Wild West"", ""Heart and Souls"", ""Ghost Dad"").

The film kicks off with a military testing as NOVA Robotics is showcasing five robots developed for the Department of Defense.  The military looks to use these robots against Moscow (note: This film was released during the Cold War between the US and U.S.S.R.) and we see the robots taking out tanks and vehicles with their laser beams.

Due to weather, everyone is brought inside of the laboratory to celebrate the robots and a Senator requests for the PR director of NOVA Robotics Howard Marner (played by Austin Pendleton, ""Glass Houses"", ""Dirty Work"", ""Christmas with the Cranks"") to meet the designer Graham Crosby, Ph. D. (played by Steve Guttenberg, ""Police Academy"" films, ""Veronica Mars"", ""Three Men and a Baby"" films) and his partner Ben Jabituya (played by Fisher Stevens, ""Lost"", ""Awake"", ""Undiscovered"").

While the NOVA staff, military and politicians are admiring the robots, the five military robots are being prepared for the Department of Defense but while the robot No. 5 is still hooked up to a generator, a lightning bolt hits the generator which produces a surge affecting the robot.

Next thing you know, No. 5's programming has been affected and he undergoes a malfunction and as he strays around inside various rooms, he is ushered into a garbage truck and taken out of the facility and is on the loose.

Because the robots are literally military weapons, NOVA Robots officer Skroeder (played by G.W. Bailey, ""Mannequin"", ""Police Academy"" films) and other soldiers go after the robot.  Skroeder has a hatred towards the robots and feels it must be destroyed but Marner and Crosby feel that the robot should be brought back in one piece.

Meanwhile, No. 5 manages to sneak into a food truck driven by Stephanie Speck (played by Ally Sheedy, ""St. Elmo's Fire"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""WarGames"").  Stephanie is an animal lover and when she discovers No. 5, she automatically assumes that he is an alien from outerspace.  She eventually communicates with No. 5 and tries to help him understand the world around him. Providing him books and access to television.

She eventually finds out through a mishap that No. 5 belongs to Nova Robotics and contacts them to pick up their robot but while she is with him, No. 5 accidentally jumps on a grasshopper and asks for Stephanie to reassemble it and she tells him that the insect is dead.  When No. 5 figures out that disassemble means ""dead"", he panics and he takes Stephanie in a joyride to escape from Nova Robotics.

Meanwhile, Crosby and Jabituya managed to find Stephanie and No. 5 and Stephanie tries to explain to Crosby that the robot has a conscience but Crosby who developed the robot doesn't believe its possible since robots run via software.  Skroeder and Nova Robotics manage to reclaim No. 5.

While in captivity, No. 5 (who's body is shut down) which is still awake (the head portion) manages to find a way to activate the whole body and commandeer the van and kicking out the passengers.  No. 5 returns to Stephanie's home but now Stephanie must find a way to protect him.  But can she trust Crosby into helping protect No. 5 from Nova Robotics?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

Surprisingly ""Short Circuit"" is presented in 1080i High-Definition Widescreen (2:40:1) instead of 1080p.  The film has scenes that are quite vibrant and look great for a film that is 23 years old but then some parts seem a bit off at times.  The good news is that there is grain present in the film but there is also dust present as well (although not that bad).  The bad news is that certain indoor scenes look a bit darker.  Even certain outdoor scenes seem to be dark (as if there was an overcast of clouds that came and disappeared). But overall, picture quality is a bit inconsistent at times.

As for the audio quality, the film is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (and also Dolby Digital 5.1).  The film is primarily front and center channel driven.  Dialogue is clear and for the most part, El DeBarge's ""Who's Johnny"" theme song seems to be the only scene where hear a lot of bass.  But there is surround channel usage during the actions sequences and the thunderstorm but I was hoping for a more immersive lossless soundtrack but overall, the soundtrack was satisfactory.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL

I grew up watching ""Short Circuit"" and watched it in the theaters and watched it countless times on cable but part of the reason why I wanted to watch this film was that it was directed by John Badham, which I loved his movies ""WarGames"" and ""Blue Thunder"" and the fact that he is reunited with Ally Sheedy who was also on ""WarGames"" and one of my favorite actresses from the 80's.

And the fact that she and Steve Guttenberg (another favorite from the 80's) were together, let's say I was feeling nostalgic and I wanted to see ""Short Circuit"" again.  The first thing my toddler asks me if this is a new ""Wall-E"" film and to tell you the truth, I never thought for once that the two look similar (but looking on Google, it seems that many have).

Overall, the film is campy but ""Short Circuit"" has that 80's charm. Yeah, it's campy but it's ""fun campy"".  A robot developing a conscience and next thing you know he's dancing to El DeBarge's ""Who's Johnny"" and John Travolta on ""Saturday Night Fever"" and repeating things he sees on television.  But it has its share of action as well with soldiers and an ex-boyfriend wanting to take on No. 5.

Sure, for today's audience it may not attract them but having grown up with this film, I enjoyed the film when it came out and watched it again and still enjoyed it today.

Granted, I wish I could tell parents that you can show this film to your young ""Wall-E"" loving toddlers but the film has its share of profanity.  I actually made the mistake in thinking this was a children's film and had my son watching the film along with me. (note: Although it says PG, there is no description of why it's PG.  I figured it was for the more action-based sequences).

As for the Blu-ray, it's one of the cheaper Blu-rays available to find online (usually under $10) and it's a release that is not in 1080p but 1080i.  There are a good number of special features but nothing new added and for the most part, picture quality is not spectacular and the lossless soundtrack is average at best.

Overall, ""Short Circuit"" is fun, campy 80's film.  Granted, with today's audience, ""Wall-E"" seems to have won the hearts of many viewers and No. 5 has been forgotten.  But with a remake of ""Short Circuit"" being developed, for those who want to go down that nostalgic road like I did (and the fact that you can find it for under $10 which is not bad), then you may want to give this Blu-ray a try.",1257811200,27,8737,4.717678100263853
361703,5,6301744136,"Short Circuit is in many ways superior to Short Circuit II.  Short Circuit II is still an excellent story.  What we have here is the perennial (new movie every year with the same theme) affirmation of the sanctity of life movie.  These two movies feature the coming of age for the robot Johnny-Five.  The first movie deals with his awakening and struggle for a place in the human-society where he finds himself.  He must battle the forces deployed by his creator-corporation to return him to the spare parts bin.  It's a nail-biter.  In the second feature he plays out a parody of Pinochio's Troubled Years as he labors in an abandoned warehouse to help ""Ben"" by day even as the bad-guys are trying to corrupt him to steal a fortune in diamonds by night.  A robot never really sleeps.  There are numerous corruptions for the young would-be citizen Johnny-Five to struggle with.  As we cut to the chase again there is a flight-to-the-death struggle as Johnny-Five hangs by a thread (a crane-cable) losing power to the strains of ""Where have all the good men gone ? ... I need a Hero !"" ... Can help arrive in time ?  Will family, friends and health-care professionals step up to save the day ?  How ?  Check it out and see !",1255219200,,1223,4.504545454545455

The storyline and humor are perfect for children and youth, but they put in language that is almost as bad as you can get.  They did not define a target market and stick with it. Without the language it would be a great film for families.  With the language it makes it adult oriented, however I believe most adults will find it only slightly amusing.

361909,4,6301744136,"I just saw this film tonight after not seeing it for about twenty years. I was nine when this movie first came out in '86 and as a child it is one of my favorites. Films like Short Circuit are more than just movies for children of the 80's decade. This movie signifies a culture of movies that we could truly identify with and that made the world of 80's cinema unlike anything else Hollywood's ever created.

Short Circuit is a gem and if you love family entertainment then you will enjoy and appreciate it. Remember, this was in the mid-eighties before outrageous, computer-enhanced special effects, sex, violence and loads of unnecessary curse words took over the SCI-Fi/Action genre. Still, back then, Johnny Five was before his time. This is as clean as they come and one of the sweetest films ever made. If it weren't for a few curse words this movie would be a G.

I'm sure fans of anything 80's will love this movie and have already seen it multiple times. If you haven't, check it out but do not expect Short Circuit to be like the action films of today. It's entertaining, silly and at some points cheesy but that's things we loved about 80's films. So, if you're up for good clean fun then I definitely recommend Short Circuit. And if you're an 80's kid like me, this should be a film added to your DVD collection.",1239926400,,1325,4.471074380165289
361910,4,6301744136,"I enjoyed watching ""Short Circuit"", but I doubt if it is for everyone.  Because of the premise that this is about an 'escaped' combat robot and because of some disturbingly milartaristic moments and questionable language, I doubt if anyone under age 17 should watch this thing.  It is a decent comedy film with a science fiction based plot, but ...  Also, one of the main characters is an asian Indian, who is stereotypical in many ways.  Unfortunately, he is one of the focal points of the comedy, which does have some racial ignorance.
I admit to sitting through it and enjoying the movie.  Also, I am giving it a good rating.  But ...  (Please do notice that those 'but's do add up to a sort of question mark.)  Do prescreen this movie for children under 17.  However, I think college age kids will enjoy this movie.  Older SF fans will, also, enjoy this movie.",1238198400,,864,4.5519480519480515
361911,1,6301744136,"I look at the majority of reviews and wonder if we were watching the same movie?  We try to prescreen our son's movies and am thankful we didn't skip prescreening this innocent looking gem.  Cute plot, cute characters, cute robot...what's not to love?  How come they can use the language they used in a kid's movie and I can't use the same language here in adult reviews?  Hmmmm?  Let me describe as best I can.  They used ""the B word, the S word, the D word.  They repeatedly used the names of Jesus and God and they weren't using them in prayer if you catch my drift.  I'm disappointed in all the rave reviews (we almost didn't prescreen this one cause of the reviews.) We had only read a few and thought ""great"".  Now, delving deeper into the reviews I find the concerned parents who said ""No"" to this movie for their kids.  If you don't use this kind of language at home, you may want to bypass on this one.  We found a hidden gem in the movie CJ7.  There was a swear word in it but the child was reprimanded by his father for it ""Even though we are poor, we don't use that kind of language.""  Brief synopsis: poor child finds alien cutie.  Has high hopes the creatures powers will help him defeat the school bully, pass his exam, etc.. That's not how his new friend works.  He does kind things like turning the 1/2 eaten apple from the city dump shiny and new before the child eats it.  It helps him learn to deal w/the bullies and the importance of actually studying for your grades.  The movie is heartwarming. Not for those who don't like magical powers in their movies or for those who don't want to read subtitles. It is a foreign film.  I thought my hyperactive son would be up and running in five minutes when we had to ""read"" the movie.  He enjoyed it enough to want to watch it again.",1236729600,8,1798,4.266272189349112
361912,4,6301744136,"This is an especially good young person's movie. It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of ""Short Circuit,"" what it means to be alive. Note Ren Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, ""Cogito, ergo sum."" (I think, therefore I am.)

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of ""Short Circuit"" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low.",1236124800,2,853,5.007042253521127

361914,4,6301744136,"The artificial love story for the gals, not the finest acting from the leads, a predictable story line: all should make this a bomb.  But Johnny Five makes it fun, and the graphics are good.  Maybe not an Academy pick, still it's a good entertainment, and not just for families.  Despite the slightly sexy bathtub scene (no nudity) and PG situations and language, it's a good entertainment.  With a nod to Eisenhower's warning on the ""military-industrial complex"", it shows the dangers of overzealous war industries in a mostly lighthearted context.  This is a fun movie despite its flaws, and Johnny Five really does steal the show.  It's a keeper.",1233273600,,649,4.908256880733945

You would never know in watching Short Circuit on Blu-Ray that this is a film that is over 20 years old. While the Blu-Ray is not in 1080p (it's in 1080i) the clarity and lack of graininess in the transfer was astounding to me. I have come to expect that older movies that weren't shot digitally and with older film equipment wouldn't see much benefit from the transition to blu-ray, this has me thinking otherwise. There are parts of the film that don't look spectacular, but they are few and far between and overall the movie looks beautiful. If you enjoyed the film, and have a HD setup, this is easily the best way to see Short Circuit.

362286,3,6301744136,"When at loss for a movie, pick a comedy I say. It always cheers you up, unless it's a particularly bad comedy. But starting to watch Short Circuit, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know anything apart from what the blurb said on the back. I knew Ally Sheedy from some of the 80s high school movies, and Fisher Stevens was apparently playing Apu from The Simpsons. OK then.

Short Circuit is one of those sweet little movies, where the blurb just simply does not do it justice. Reading the blurb, I was not thrilled about watching it - it totally gives the wrong idea about the movie. Rather than a movie about robots (zzzzzz), it's a movie about a robot, who gets human feelings after being struck by lightning. Number 5, or Johnny 5 as he (it?) becomes later known at the end of the movie, is a hilarious little robot, who can mimic anything, and do anything, not believing he's a robot. He's alive!

The plot's not THAT terrific. A previously killer robot gets struck by lightning, somehow gets human feelings, learns to drive, reads everything in sight for ""input"", watches TV for input, and even gets a female friend in Ally Sheedy. There are two guys chasing him, the only two who seemingly know how to reprogram him to become a killing machine again, when they originally designed him as a marital aid. (How?) There are several funny scenes, one of the stand out scenes for me being dancing to Saturday Night Fever (still a god awful film but never mind), and saying ""input"" constantly.

Ally Sheedy, Fisher Stevens and the rest of the cast do brilliantly with what little they have to work with - what you'll normally find when an actor has to work opposite something CGI/puppet/animal, and the money's gone on the special effects rather than the script. The special effects were good, considering if Short Circuit was ever remade (heaven forbid) it would be full of CGI and not realistic at all. The way it has been done is good, and believable. Who says robots don't have feelings?

Short Circuit was amazing, although having never heard of it before, I was happy to watch it and surprised when it was quite good. Johnny 5 is one of the sweetest robots you will watch in this time, when it has not been touched by CGI or any celebrity voice behind the robot. Genius.",1207872000,4,2281,4.542579075425791

362370,4,6301744136,"Short Circuit is one of those films I rented as a kid back in the precious 80s when we got so many good family movies that just wouldn't see the light of day in these awful times. A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.

I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.

The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.

It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s. The video-game obsessed kids of today might to be so interested but its charming simplicity and good-natured story will never really date despite the old-fashioned 'cutting-edge' technology featured in the film.

This DVD from Image Entertainment contains a NON-anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and a commentary among a few other extras. I believe it also comes in a crappy snapper case. The UK DVD from Cinema Club however IS anamorphic but drops the commentary and has Dolby 2.0 sound. The rest of the extras remain.

#5 manages design a strategy where Stephanie is to meet Crosby at the Black Lion Inn.  #5 defeats the other Saint 5 robots, breaks through the security encryption protection the robots programming and reprograms the robots to enact a scene from the three stooges.

Why, you'd send out the military/goon types to bring him back so you could disassemble him and find out what went wrong.  Right?

  Well, disassembling a robot is an awful lot like dissecting an animal, and it doesn't take long for that ingratiating buckets of bolts who calls himself Five (""Five alive!"") to figure any of that out.  With the resourceful Ally on board Five is soon learning about life and eluding his bumbling pursuers.  Among those in pursuit is Five's creator, Steve Guttenberg, and his vaguely Indian or Pakastani assistant Fisher Stevens.  The movie indicates that there's an urgency to finding the errant robot before the guys with the guns do, but it's hard to tell - the actor Guttenberg doesn't do `urgency' terribly well, and Fisher Stevens seems an over-caffienated bundle of energy.  While in most movies either character would be too much (or too little,) in SHORT CIRCUIT the two rather neatly cancel each other out.

 SHORT CIRCUIT is one of those movies you like despite yourself.  It's corny and obvious and seemed aimed at non-discriminating 10-year-olds.  Guttenberg is a cinderblock of an actor, and while I bought Five's breathless declaration - ""Five alive!"" - if I heard Guttenberg say it I'd probably ask for proof. Whatever humor you can milk from ineptly gung-ho military types is milked dry long before they put away their guns.  Still, this one seems safe and relatively acceptable to all age groups.  Sheedy's a marvel, and her scenes with Five contain whatever magic this story holds.  Probably not a classic, but touching in spots.

While the special effects are indeed from the 80's (as they should be since this film came out in 1985), the story of love, compassion, and believing that Number 5 really is allive is what makes this classic film worth watching time and time again.

If you've got kids, then you need to show 'em this movie.  There's more to life than SpongeBob, Dora the Explorer, and the like.  Good, wholesome, family comedy-adventure movies are hard to come by, but this one fits to the bill.

It still makes me smile 20 years later!",1139616000,4,732,4.515151515151516

362547,4,6301744136,"'Saturday Night Fever' (1977) will probably always be director John Badham's most famous movie. My personal favorite will probably always be his 'Dracula' (1979). But his 'Short Circuit' (1986) is top notch as well. On the surface it may look like a silly movie about a robot that comes to life when it is struck by lightning. But as in his 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Dracula,' Director John Badham takes the movie to a much deeper level than we expected. The robot (# 5) was originally built for the purpose of killing, and when he comes to life, he can not accept that. While # 5 is undoubtedly the star of this movie, there is an excellent supporting cast. Stephanie is wonderful as the benevolent woman who by chance crosses his path and  accidentally becomes responsible for # 5's most famous line: 'NO DISASSEMBLE!' Newton does a good job of the scientist who can not (at least for awhile) bring himself to believe what we as the audience have seen. Ben is hilarious as the Indian who works with Newton. (I.E. When # 5 gets angry and the driver of the truck asks what to do, Ben replies: 'I don't know about you, but I am planning to scream and run.') Howard is memorable as the scientist who has started to become more concerned with business, but his former values of science start to reemerge. What makes this movie so wonderful is that while it is filled with suspense and comedy, it also offers important questions and issues. (How far will science go to kill people? Should important scientific values start giving way to business? Is it easier to destroy than to analyze? We are always looking for new life, but when we find it will we be likely to destroy it?) This is an excellent movie that not only maintains it comical tones, but it offers us suspense and some things to think about. This is certainly worth giving a chance to. If you like this, be sure to check out John Badham's 'Saturday Night Fever'(1977) and 'Dracula' (1979). Thanks again for the great finished product John!",1128729600,3,2000,4.58659217877095

362549,5,6301744136,"Gilmore Girls is uniquely poised as the first show to really integrate little-known rock bands seamlessly into episodes, making this a great sampler not only of music from the show, but of the best in indie music (along with a few standards, of course). ""Our Little Corner"" includes a great selection of songs from the first two seasons, as well as Sam Phillips' inspired cues.

As a fanatic follower of the show, I know of a few tracks I would have liked to see here, but overall it's a good representation. As a music fan, it's a bit scattered--when was the last time you saw Carole King, Joey Ramone, and Bjork together?--but still coherent enough to be fun. And, as previously mentioned, it's a great way to pick up tracks you might not find in your local music store's pop-rock section.",1125360000,,791,4.609929078014185
362550,3,6301744136,"Short Circuit is great fun for what it is: a campy '80s flick about technology, AI, and ""living"" machines. Ally Sheedy does a great job, and the other actors are somewhat decent, but the script could use some real improvement. The special effects are nothing to write home about today, although I remember seeing shows dedicated to the ""revolutionary"" motion-capture equipment they used to control Johnny 5.

I enjoy '80s movies overall, even if it's just to laugh at the outdated music, hairdos, and cheesy lines. They're also generally enjoyable because these movies are unmarred by the moody brooding of the movies from the '90s and ""aughts."" Short Circuit, while a light-hearted jaunt through the lenses of the '80s, still remains somewhat mediocre. There are plenty of other great flicks from the decade - ""Batteries Not Included,"" for instance - that deal with the same subject matter and are much better films overall.",1125187200,2,925,5.045751633986928

The only knock is the umd itself, they coulda put a whole lot more emphasis on the load screen. All you get is the title Short Circuit on a grey background.

362688,5,6301744136,"This movie can be viewed on a basic level: action, explosions, gunfire!  On a ""higher"" level, there are the characters: Ally Sheedy's naive, ditsy lover of disadvantaged creatures, who takes in stray animals.  Her wide-eyed confidence, ""I KNEW you'd pick me!"", when she thinks the robot is an alien visiting earth, is typical of her endearing character.  The relationship to the robot is very credible.  The gestures of the robot are better than E.T.'s and must have been designed by an actor.

On another level, there are the political and economic implications: weapons research, the tension between congress and the military, etc.

On another level, there is the wit: the Indian character's slight alterations of American cliches forces us to hear those cliches for the first time and to see how silly some of them are.

Finally, for the contemplative, there is the metaphysical level: what does it mean to be alive?  what is the difference between being alive and merely being functional?

362689,5,6301744136,"I bestow this epic Johnny-5 out of 5 stars.

Not since ""Police Academy 4 - Citizens on Patrol"" has Steve Guttenberg given us such a stunning performance. Mr. Guttenberg doesn't tell the story he lets the story tell itself. The cast of supporting actors shine as well. Keeping up nicely with the high mark Mr. Guttenberg has set. It's a shame that they weren't the recipients of the 1986 Academy Award. Johnny 5 the most lovable of the bunch looks similar to what you would have if you were to take a box cutter and slowly skin away the latex covering on E.T. to reveal just the animatronic puppet beneath. Even with the aforementioned statement Johnny still makes for a very deep and inspirational character. In fact he inspired me to pursue my love for Jamie Lyons, and just for the record ,Jamie, it doesn't say anywhere in the restraining order that I can't mention you in a online movie review of Short Circuit on Amazon.com so just lay off b1tch, God I love you!!

The story starts with Johnny 5 as a killing machine made for Military uses. After getting struck by lightning in a demo for the Military Johnny receives feelings and the ability to tell bad jokes. Funny because a friend of mine Keith Ko, was struck by lightning and all he received was 10 minutes of unconsciousness and a soiled pair of tighty whiteies to boot. After Johnny gets his new found talents he takes us all on a journey that we will not soon forget. It's up to you if you will take this journey with him.

This is a very bad movie.  Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before.

Expressed in what I feel is a highly entertaining and humorous manor, it is definately worth a viewing, and perhaps owning.
Of course there is the draw back, of the fact the DVD is letterbox widescreen, meaning that if you have, or plan to get a widescreen TV the quality will be short of that of an anamorphic version which appears not to exist at the time, it is the sole reason for 4 versus 5 stars.",1037664000,6,645,4.4491525423728815
362766,5,6301744136,"Short Circuit is one of those movies that when it came out in 1985 I remembered walking out thinking what a fun film that was. Alley Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg were a great screen team. And fresh of Saturday Night Fever ad Wargames, director John Badham really showed the compassionate side of humanity. This is a warm and friendly family film for everyone.
The plot is simple - aren't they all? The military develops a device meant for war and `first strike' and decides to take it to the officials of the government for funding. Five very unique and laser-powered robots are built. Something happens to one of them, ""Number 5"", during the demonstration where an electrical storm creates an electrical surge and super jolts Number 5. Guess what? He comes alive! Complete with a personality and a small amount charm. He escapes (accidentally) and befriends an animal activist Stephanie (Sheedy) while Newton (Guttenberg) is assigned to chase him down and get him back.
Now add the adversary of the military trying to destroy him and you've got a great chase movie. Filled with laughs, bits, gags and a few scene stealing lines, this movie makes you believe that Number 5 IS alive! Some great supporting character roles and a lot of technically puppetry that would make even George Lucas jealous - the energy in this movie is great.
The DVD extras include a commentary with the director and writers as well as the original 1985 interviews with cast and crew. This is definitely a fun family film and something everyone who likes science fiction and fantasy mixed together will enjoy this a lot!",1026950400,62,1594,4.821167883211679

The expolits of the robot # 5 who thought that he was a living breathing thinking individual with feelings was a rather entertaining movie with a lot of the stuff that kids find cool in it. A crazy funny robot with some classic tag lines, lazers, and explosions, and a movie that's in general silly.
  Until this DVD was released I never got to see this movie in widescreen, and now that I have I am shocked as to how much of the picture was actually missing. The more widescreen movies that I watch the less I can stand Pan & Scam. Short Circuit was a movie that really suffered when it was transfered to pan & Scam. The movie has a decent transfer, not the best, but this is certainly the best presentation of the movie I have ever seen, and it also features decent sound. It's a little lacking in the special features, but would be a good buy for those wanting to relive a childhood memory from the 80s.

If you were sentient yourself in '86, no doubt you remember this one. It's the epitome of an eighties movie in all the wrong ways: bad comedy, forced plot developments, a big dose of cold war overtones, a valley girl accent, Steve Guttenberg... the list is awfully lengthy. We've even got a white man in brown face, though he does nothing terribly egregious or offensive beyond the (surprisingly convincing) makeup.

Short Circuit manages to get by on the power of spirit and enthusiasm alone, which is itself another '80s stereotype. It's got energy to spare, plus absolutely no shame over its shortcomings, which makes it awkwardly endearing. Having said that, and appreciated it, the flick is often eye-roll bad, much worse than I'd remembered. Subtle like a bull on the warpath and cheesier than a Kraft dinner, I felt a little embarrassed for being such a fan back when I could still count my age on two hands. My sons, though, only a few years removed from that age themselves, adored it, so maybe there's something innocent and beautiful about that.
