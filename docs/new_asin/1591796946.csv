200463,4,1591796946,"Here is a lecture by Eckhart Tolle taped in a lecture hall in front of a live audience. Production values are fair to poor. It looks like someone in the audience had a camcorder and taped it.

It takes a while for Eckhart to warm up. In fact, he seems really hesitant and shy at first, like he is trying to gather the courage to speak to this group. You can find most of his ideas presented much better in his books. He's not a great speaker. In fact he burps and belches quite frequently in the talk, after drinking a glass of water. This is mildy distracting. If this is your first exposure to his ideas, you'll need to concentrate to follow him. He's trying to make it easy to undertstand, but it's really important to listen carefully.

He rolls his eyes around a lot and there are a lot of breath noises and sound effects, as he is trying to parody the ego-driven mind that he is telling us to overcome. This is the funniest thing of all- he actually parodies the title of the talk, Finding your Life's Purpose as being ""what THEY tell me the talk is supposed to be about""

If you get past all of this and concentrate on what he is saying, it is quite a nice introduction to his philosophy, which seems quite similar to Buddhism. He throws in some quotations of Jesus so that the more conventional christian audience will not be offended and will maybe listen to him. In fact there are quite a lot of differences between this and christian religion as you would hear from thousands of pulpits every Sunday.

It's certainly worth a look if you are too lazy to read his books.",1248134400,11,1579,4.324324324324325
200464,5,1591796946,"This DVD is very clear and practical.  If you only watch or listen to one program by Eckhart Tolle, this is the one to get.  Most human beings live in a virtual reality world of mental constructs, and they rarely experience the richness of this moment. They are continually looking for a purpose in the future, while missing their primary purpose: to fully experience What Is, in this moment.  On this DVD, Eckhart discusses:

* The concept of Time.  I've never heard it explained so clearly. There is no past and no future.  All that we call ""time"" is a mental abstraction.  We rush around wishing we had more time, and all we have is this moment.  His discussion on Time brings the topic back to your purpose: to live your life in this moment (rather than wasting it living in mental abstraction).

* Achievement vs. Purpose.  Eckhart travels the world speaking and teaching, and has certainly achieved far more than most people.  His achievements and efforts have arisen out of the present moment awareness that he lives in.  When your focus is on the end result, and in the process of achieving that result, you miss your real purpose (finding your sense of home, self and completeness in this moment), your achievements take on far less meaning.  Let your motivation for achievement arise out of the completeness of being IN your purpose (as opposed to trying to complete yourself by achieving some purpose you made up in your head).

----

Contrary to the one-star reviewer of this DVD's opinion, Eckhart is not suggesting finding your purpose in sitting on the couch, eating & watching Oprah all day. But of course, Jesus never advocated many of the things that have been said and done in the name of Christianity either.  Those who have ears to hear tend to hear, and the rest walk away with more mental constructs to add to their virtual selves.

This DVD isn't just for people looking for their first Eckhart Tolle experience.  If you have been reading, listening to and watching Eckhart for years this DVD is well worth the investment.

Most people want to find their purpose because they are looking for completion, for fulfillment, and to be all they can be.  This DVD will show you where to find that purpose.  As to what you do, what you accomplish, what you achieve, etc... that's something else.

So here's the big question: If you are completely fulfilled, will you be motivated to do anything, or will you just sit around, eat and watch Oprah?  Some people think you have to be unfulfilled in order to accomplish anything.  They seem to think that all achievement arises out of unfulfillment.  This philosophy turns you into a Human Doing; looking for that next achievement to complete your self. But you never get there.  Human Beings find their purpose in Being.  Out of that place of completion and fulfillment they achieve great things.

I wouldn't have taken the time to write this review, but I initially saw the one-star review and didn't want people to miss a great DVD for the wrong reasons.",1243555200,82,3019,4.699047619047619
200465,5,1591796946,"In this expertly produced DVD Tolle extols living in the now as everyone's primary life purpose.  The DVD format, like Tolle's message, is simple - Tolle delivers a talk on a stage before a live audience.  This DVD is so appealing because Tolle's communication is very often non-verbal.  Tolle demonstrates his devotion to living in the now through his lengthy pauses or the way in which he deliberately and slowly takes a sip of water while on stage.  His humor is often based on hand gestures and facial expressions, making the DVD format preferable to capture Tolle's wit.  Those who only know Tolle through his writing or CD recordings will find this DVD a most complete way to hear and enjoy Tolle's message that the past and future only live in our heads, and all we really have is the present moment.  Don't miss this stellar DVD.",1242259200,3,837,4.659863945578231

200474,5,1591796946,"I have Tolle's book, ""The Power of Now"" but wanted something to watch while exercising on stationary exercise equipment (something other than TV garbage).  Watching and listening to Tolle in this context, his teaching is MUCH more powerful and clear.  I got so much more out of it and watch it over and over.  Perhaps it's because I'm pretty visually oriented, but the DVD is much more powerful to me than the book.  I was surprised by his subtle and gentle humor - that doesn't come through in the book at all...

200477,1,1591796946,"I think people, writers, and critics, self-help books hear this call, people demanding a sign, something of meaning, if they are in some kind of religion, they want to put the best into it. If they are not religious, they want to have the best kind of psychology and meaning.  There's some difference between the two worth consideration and discussion.  The people writing these books think they are making a sign, but if they swerve all around to counter philosophies, from Buddhism, to Eastern philosophies, trying to make a coherent picture, the issue is that these different beliefs do not fit together in the same book that creates a Christian renewal and vision or framework for understanding the mind, and improving the human inter-relational view, from friendships, to family views, to marriage and parenthood.  To say ""This, too, will pass"" sounds good, because it quotes a famous George Harrison song, but it is not a holistic pro-creational view that gets the ego moving in the positive inter-relational view of a more related and central soul beliefs vision of harmony.  To say ""This, too, will pass"" neglects the need to recreate dysfunctional systems, in the person, in the ego, the center part where the person decides what to think, how to feel, what to create and input into the views of the people around, what to add, in becoming more whole.  And, it doesn't relate to a vision of dualism really where some government systems and social systems are wrong, will not pass without being forced, and where people are eliminated for beliefs by evil decision makers who have power, dictators,
Anyone could take the right view of this book, it is artistic, but not holistically correct.  The Buddhist monk, indicated by this phrase is finding inner peace, but the ayatola dictator in Syria and Libya is killing thousands, and the black preacher on television, getting emotional and raising up the crowd is moving active hearts in a community to become unified in that community, not absent from it as a silent meditator who decides that he can work through books and introspection to ""free the self"" this modern trend in psychological self-help literature, that is, in relation to my first substantive recognition of the astounding concept: religious literature releasing the concept of redemption is different from the psycho-babble self-help literature that puts a pseudo-science relational aspective procreative view into the minds of the quick and numerous followers, and weaves a false vision of prophecy around a unified view of all religions and science and philosophy.  This is not a negative, it is a decision about how someone can spend time, but the failure of modern books to focus on self-help through introspection and ""feel good about me"" and ""look in the mirror and smile"" is more of an absent independence from the actively distressed world around.
 The final point I would like to make in summation releases this book from my purview as good inspirational literature.  Please let me explain.  The jargon on page 23, at the end of chapter one, indicates a sketchy interpretation of the New Testament, by stating, directly, in italics for emphasis, and quoting the book exactly, ""`A new heaven' is the emergence of a transformed state of human consciousness, and ""a new earth"" is its reflection in the physical realm.""  This is not in accord with substantive beliefs of faithful Christians of many sects and Catholics, who agree, with considerable variation, but differentially from Eckhart Tolle, that the door to salvation, the new heaven which Eckhart Tolle is referring to, Jesus speaks, ""Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.  After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door, then you will stand outside and saying, `Lord, open the door for us.' He will say to you in reply, `I do not know where you are from.' And you will say, `We ate and drank and you taught in our company in our streets.  Then he will say to you, `I do not know where [you] are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!""  (Luke 13:22-27).  There is substantive disregard in Tolle's prose for the relational aspects of the new world he talks about figuratively, and biblical prophecy that real Salvation will demand judgment upon the person from Jesus Christ.  Implicated in Tolle's prose is the undercurrent often in psychological literature seeks to free the self from substantive judgment, and place the soul in continuance with a backslide from reality by simplifying life`s understanding of eternal meanings to reading a book and except the courage to make real challenges to the implications of evil in the modern world.  However, Eckhart Tolle emphasizes ""This, too, shall pass.""  And, in circumspect, with regard to the Christian scriptures, that delineate the meaning of Jesus' words and message, Tolle is not a prophet or a leader by religious standards, but his meanings are against the tenets of the Gospel: that there is a harsh prophecy of division in the world between good and evil, and the veil between the two will be arranged in sight of the Gospel.  In retrospect, visitation of chapter one indicates no annunciation of this division, in ethereal terms of enlightened division between good and evil.  After stating his assumption of the Gospel in starting his book,  four sentences later, Tolle writes, ""Since human life and consciousness are intrinsically one with the life of the planet, as the old consciousness dissolves, there are bound to be synchronistic geographic and climatic natural upheavals in many parts of the planet, some of which we are already witnessing now."" (p. 23).  With reference to my transcription of Luke, above, Tolle's book makes no delineation that Jesus will divide and judge the Earth with concord with the scriptures, and those reading this as Christian spiritual and redemptive literature are misled and will be deceived by Tolle's portrayal of ""the new heaven and a new earth.""  The Gospel is clear in circumspect of the future in Luke, and the return of Jesus Christ in the final days, regarding Luke's thirteenth chapter, with this subchapter entitled, ""The Narrow Door; Salvation and Rejection.""",1307404800,,6247,4.997109826589595

200479,5,1591796946,"I watched all of the Eckhart Tolle's DVD's from Netflix, and this is my favorite. If you're only able to buy one, this is the one to buy. I didn't get anything out of reading his books, an audio book was just okay, but I am loving this DVD. I come home in my normal state, which I call life, or more agitated than usual, and with this DVD, Tolle guides me out of my mind & emotions into Presence.

Along the lines of, ""no problem can be solved at the level of consciousness that created it"", spending even a little time in Presence has helped me gain great clarity. I can't explain how it works but I'm experiencing positive results in business, relationships, to even enjoying house cleaning (that's a first!). One weekend day after a morning session in Presence, I did something ""out of the blue"", got a great response, and then, ""that's what my family wanted all along?"" Go figure.

Philosophically, Eckhart Tolle says our purpose in life is to be in the Presence, period. Beyond that, secondary purpose is to just live in the now and do what is next to be done. The philosophy is simple, but it can be challenging practicing living in Presence. That's why I recommend this DVD.",1266969600,26,1181,4.462962962962963

I watched this video then I started focusing on my breath during my workdays and other daily chores and activities. And within a week it resulted in me living a life of bliss. And as if living in a bliss state wasn't enough I also started performing, in all areas of life, much more efficiently, increasing productivity by at least 4x the amount as before. Prior to this video I was  inundated with extreme levels of stress, dealing with an anxiety disorder, cycles of depression, self-doubt and lack of confidence. All of it, every bit of it, is completely gone and has stayed gone and consistent. The bliss state became much less intense but all that crud I shed has yet to creep back. My life went from suffering to non-suffering in the course of a week.
