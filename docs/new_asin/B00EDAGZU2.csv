5904172,2,B00EDAGZU2,"Warning...spoilers...if that's even possible...

A babysitter and two of her charges--a sex-fixated 15-year-old boy and his princess fixated little sister are trapped in a bathroom overnight when the oldest son goes completely crazy--something that we find out has happened before---apparently on many occasions.  While Bad Behavior has good acting and some of the individual scenes work well, it isn't suspenseful and it literally makes no logical sense.  We are asked to believe that a) the parents would leave their children in the care of a stranger even though their oldest son is a psychopath; b) the parents of the babysitter who know exactly where she is would never actually go looking for her; c) the babysitter's friend who is the normal family babysitter but wasn't available somehow managed to never see the psychotic side of the oldest son; d) the crazy eldest son whose violent behavior in the past included setting fire to a dog and burning down a house, sending his younger brother to the emergency room and doing something sinister to a previous babysitter that caused her to drop out of school immediately before graduation has somehow managed to completely escape the notice of the law.

The ending perfectly summarizes the complete lack of logical thought behind the film--(spoiler alert!!!)--the parents who have finally come home drive off with their kids leaving the babysitter and her boyfriend locked in the bathroom...and that's it.  Seriously?  And, again--the police aren't going to come looking for the babysitter even though her parents know exactly where she went?  And her friend the normal babysitter knows exactly where she went?  Are the babysitter and her boyfriend trapped in the bathroom until they turn into skeletons?  They can't figure out a way to get out through the large skylight in the bathroom ceiling?  Trying to send a morse code message with the bathroom light fixture while there is still bright sunlight outside is really a better idea than climbing out through the skylight?

What kind of movie Bad Behavior is actually supposed to be I really couldn't even say.  It's definitely not a horror film, although the set-up and poster might suggest that it is.  There's virtually no attempt to actually generate suspense, so it doesn't seem to be a thriller.  There are a handful of laughs but not nearly enough for Bad Behavior to qualify as a comedy.  The movie makes way too little sense to be taken seriously as a drama.  Presumably, the people behind this thing had some sort of idea what kind of film they were trying to make--but unless they actually set out to completely waste their talented cast's efforts as well as waste the time of anyone unfortunate enough to actually sit through this mess then they failed spectacularly and completely.",1456617600,,2800,5.015118790496761

When Zoe's boyfriend, Kansas (Andrew James Allen- DARK POWER, SMILEY) shows up, things begin to get -somewhat- interesting. Mysteriously knocked unconscious, Zoe awakens to find Kansas missing, and a supposed madman on a rampage in the house! BAD BEHAVIOR is an odd movie. It rolls right along, up until Zoe, and two of the kids, lock themselves in the bathroom. They spend a big chunk of the movie's running time just sitting around, or being scared by bangs and poundings on the door. On the positive side, there are some humorous moments, as well as a few tense situations. There's also a decent twist involving the rest of the family. Bottom line: Just too much time spent in one room! More monotonous than maniacal...

5904185,1,B00EDAGZU2,"Completely stupid, unbelievable plot coupled with bad acting.  What a waste!!",1425686400,6,77,6.0
5904186,1,B00EDAGZU2,"This movie was full of suspense and it held my attention, and I guessed the ending but I was completely wrong, and so the ending totally shocked me. I love when a movie has a surprising twist ending, but, at the end of the movie, I was full of questions. Also, the trailer was misleading and incorrect and gave away too much of the story.

SPOILER ALERT... At the end, Zoey and Kansas are locked in the bathroom, and the parents take their three kids out for ice cream like it is a happy afternoon. So, the parents obviously did not want Zoey and Kansas to tell anyone that Jack is insane because they are in denial and want him to go to Yale.

So, what can we assume happens after the ending? Zoey said that her parents will come to get her if she doesn't come home. So, Zoey goes missing and Kansas goes missing, and the police are called for a search. Zoey's parents will say that the last place they knew of their daughter being was in that house. The police would definitely come to the house, and at the very least, ask some questions. Zoey and Kansas would probably be hidden away somewhere by the parents.  So, the parents will lie to the police, and Tyler and Grace will also lie (because they have been threatened and bribed by their parents and because something similar to this must have happened before, so they are used to it, and because they are afraid to tell). So we can assume that there is a search and the police do not find anything, and then Zoey and Kansas become unsolved missing persons. We don't know how much time passed between the moment that the parents got home and the ice cream afternoon ... I assume that the parents are used to this and were prepared for this and had Zoey and Kansas locked away somehow until the police gave up and then moved them to the bathroom later.

Should we assume that the parents will kill Zoey and Kansas? They can't keep them locked up in the bathroom forever, so, if they don't kill them, there are no other options. Tyler said that something happened to another babysitter ""that they loved"" -- she dropped out of high school right before graduation (which no one would do) -- we can guess that Jack killed her, but did the parents kill her? We never find out what all of Jack's other crimes were. Are the parents even more insane than Jack? Maybe Jack went crazy from something that the parents did to him. What was all of this medication that the whole family was taking, which Grace called candy?  (Grace thinks she is a vegetarian but she eats baloney.)

At first, I could not believe that Tyler never reported Jack to anyone. Tyler was hospitalized because of Jack, and he has been living in fear for a very long time. Especially if the parents are just as crazy. Tyler should have made a report about this family, even for Grace's sake. Tyler must have thought about running away, but at 15, where would he go, and how could he leave his little sister?  I think that Tyler knew, from the moment that Jack got angry, that Zoey and Kansas were never getting out because he had seen similar things before. Tyler did seem very calm, like he was used to all of it. So, Tyler was just waiting for himself and Grace to get out of the bathroom, knowing all along that Zoey and Kansas were not going anywhere. I think that Tyler never tells because the parents bribe him to keep quiet, like he said, they bought him a computer. So, when Grace gets old enough to want to tell, the parents can bribe Grace also. Beyond any threatening and bribery, there is fear. So, Tyler and Grace will never tell.

It is because of the ending that I am giving this movie one star. The ending that I was guessing was completely different.  I knew that there was not going to be any happy ending.  I knew that Jack would not be taken away (that he would get away with it, because he had gotten away with everything else that he had done).  But my guess was that the parents would come home, and somehow Jack would kill the parents in a rage, then Jack would kill Tyler and Zoey and Kansas, and my guess was that Grace would be the sole survivor (because Jack seemed to be soft toward her), and that Grace would protect Jack because she was trained so well not to tell. So, Jack would go on to Yale. Grace would go into foster care or to live with other relatives. And everyone would believe that someone else broke into the house and killed everyone. And maybe the twist would be that we somehow realize that Grace is also insane now, from everything that she has been through. Again, that was the type of ending that I was expecting, and the actual ending really shocked me.

I am also giving this movie one star because I would not recommend it. It was very scary, but it was also too long and dragged out. I wanted to know what Jack's other crimes were. I wanted some kind of backstory of what caused Jack to be insane. And, I cannot believe that the parents would just leave Zoey and Kansas alone in the bathroom with the possibility that they could escape or somehow be found. If the parents are going to kill Zoey and Kansas (and I cannot think of what else they could possibly do next), then what are they waiting for? Why was the house soundproofed -- did the parents do that?

I saw a few times that either Zoey or Tyler could have run out of the house screaming, but they did not -- especially while Jack was pinned under the furniture, it was obvious that he was going to get himself free, and the two of them didn't take the opportunity to run outside. Also, by the end of the movie, we see that the parents are used to covering up Jack's crimes any way that they feel that they need to...so, why would they hire a babysitter to stay in the house all night? Even if Jack was acting normally for a while, they were aware of what he was capable of, so why would they leave a stranger in the house with him and their other two children all night? The mother made a comment that Zoey was pretty, so by that comment (and Tyler's comment about the other babysitter being pretty), we can assume that there is fear of danger by the mother. So, the parents should have taken the three kids with them (even though they were told not to -- they could have left the three kids in the hotel room for a few hours) or they should not have gone at all. Whether it is overnight or even for an hour, these parents should never use a babysitter. When the movie started, I thought it was strange that a college-age kid and a 15 year old kid (either or both) were not capable of watching their sister (so that the parents would spend money that they don't want to spend). I think it would have made more sense for the parents to leave the three kids in the house alone, because it was said many times that Jack had a problem with strangers, so putting a stranger in the house would set him off. I also was shocked that Zoey invited her boyfriend over when she is supposed to be babysitting (being paid to watch the child) when there are two other kids in the house who are definitely awake after 9:00 p.m., and that she introduced her boyfriend to Jack like there was nothing wrong with having Kansas over, and that immediately she is on the couch with him, kissing, with the other kids in the house ... that was Zoey's ""bad behavior."" If Zoey did not invite Kansas over, maybe Jack would not have gone off.

And, what about the ending after the ending ... in other words, what about when Jack goes to Yale and continues to go nuts on people? We cannot assume that Jack will go to Yale and never go off on anyone ever again. The parents will not be there to protect him. And my guess still remains that Grace will go insane later also (and maybe also Tyler already was insane too).

I was also shocked that Jack cut off a chunk of his own ear. Why would he do that? And, when the parents got home, did they take him to the emergency room or a doctor to get stitched up and to get medication to prevent infection? Didn't the doctor ask Jack how this injury happened? Doctors have to ask. Didn't the doctor see how nuts Jack was?

What bothered me the most about this movie was... it was totally believable and possible, up until the ending. We can't believe that these parents just keep killing whomever gets in the way whenever their son goes off...and we can't believe that Jack could go on being so sick forever, because sooner or later, he has to go nuts and the parents won't be there to protect him and he will get caught and then every one of his crimes will be exposed, as well as the parents' involvement, and even Tyler's. So, the sequel would be that Tyler and Grace go nuts next.

I am analyzing this movie more than it deserves which is another reason that I am giving it one star, because it is ridiculous.

The actor who played Jack did an amazing job. I just saw him in another movie where he plays a gay teenager who is sweet and funny and adorable, so this was a completely different type of part, which shows what a really good actor he is. I would like to give this movie five stars just for his acting talents, but I really would never recommend this movie to anyone.",1420243200,20,9123,4.294186046511628

5904195,3,B00EDAGZU2,"Decently well acted, but it failed to captivate me.  At first I was enjoying this.  It is obviously a film with a mediocre budget, and the acting was pretty good; in fact, I really liked all the actors and actresses.  Linda Hamilton caught my attention as the mother, but she had little screen time.  I feared that I would lose interest because of that, but the rest of the cast, especially the little girl, was very good!  The little girl was charming and fun, the younger brother was rather funny and touching in his own way as the one who has endured the most in this family, and the brother, Jack, was terrific.  The baby-sitter was great, but all of them together couldn't make the entire middle of the script riveting.

SPOILERISH - but not in any major way -

Yet despite all the talent and a decent plot, probably the fact that the majority of the film takes place in the bathroom got to be very boring very fast.  At first I didn't mind it too much, but there were so many opportunities for the baby-sitter and the kids to escape.  At first I couldn't even believe that Zoe believed the lame story she was told about why she woke up in the bathroom!  If I were her, I would have thought it was a giant joke or some sort of baby-sitter hazing.  She and the kids endured what...two days in a bathroom?

They were hungry and bored and had to pee... we get it.  But nobody ever really took any real initiative to deal with a situation that didn't seem to be all that impossible to me.  Yes, the captor was dangerous, but against several of them and for every moment?  I just couldn't buy it.  I kept watching even tho my eyelids started to droop.  Talk, talk, let's play pretend, talk, talk...  It got to be very dull to me.

It would have to pick up at some point, right?

But no...it dragged on and on and the tense moments were too few and far between.

I finally made it to the end and it was a real let-down.  One of those endings that is supposed to be some great twist but really isn't.  Or was it not a twist but we were just supposed to be shocked by the peoples' behaviour at the end?  And the fate of two characters is shown...sort of, I guess.  We are really supposed to believe that that is plausible forever?  Come on!

It is just too implausible, even for fiction.  I wasn't shocked or even terribly surprised.  I was bored and then let down.

I can't say that I regret watching this because I don't.  For some reason I'm glad I gave it a chance.  If the script had been a bit ""tighter"" and the ending more plausible (even just a little!) I would probably watch it again.

As it stands, however, I won't be watching it again or recommending it.  I have a love for low-budget films, but most of the time I don't find them almost-drooling-into-my-lap dull, but this one was for quite some time.

8604140,1,B00EDAGZU2,Screw this movie. The beginning and middle were alright. The ending sucked. They left you hanging too much. I don't recommend this.,1475193600,,131,5.0
8604141,1,B00EDAGZU2,"Low budget movies with good ideas can work.  This one had an interesting idea to work with, but it suffered from being too long, too boring, and had a villain with a weapon (a frying pan and not even a cast iron one) that was just not scary.  I think that if someone was to remake this movie as a 20 minute short it might be pretty good.  The ending also was lame, it couldn't decide if it wanted to be truly dark or give hope, so it just gave you more of the same.

I would skip this movie.",1474761600,,491,3.88

8604145,2,B00EDAGZU2,"I truly had hope for this movie, but oh god! First of all, the acting by the ""villain"" is so horribly bad. How they were cast is beyond me. I think the concept of the movie could be great, but they just fell short. The ending needs to be changed though, what a disappointing ending. It makes no sense, nothing is explained, it just leaves you with more questions. It's an okay one time watch, if you really have nothing else better to do. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.",1469577600,3,472,4.314606741573034
