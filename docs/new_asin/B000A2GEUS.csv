8072441,1,B000A2GEUS,"I didn't hold much hope for this DVD when I ordered it but decided to try it out anyway, that was a mistake.

Amazon gives a 2005 release date, the packaging says 2004 but the program itself originally aired (somewhere) in 1996 so don't expect any murder stuff.

The video quality is terrible, maybe worse than if you had taped it yourself from TV at the worst possible recording speed with a worn out tape. I found that so distracting I had trouble paying attention.

You get several ""talking heads"" that you may recognize (most of the time they aren't identified)but there is no captioning or subtitling, hard of hearing?- you're in trouble. You won't learn anything beyond these people's opinions, no evidence presented to back anything up.

The video bits you see?, same old, old stuff- almost nothing you haven't seen a dozen times before at better quality in many other DVD's/tapes.

The main value here is in using the disc as a drink coaster and the DVD case for storing some better program. Definitely not worth the money, maybe not even if you can find it at some local garage sale for 50 cents.",1145923200,3,1105,4.61734693877551
