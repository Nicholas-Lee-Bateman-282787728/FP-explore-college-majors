2415644,5,B000BF0D92,"I found this film to be quite engaging and maybe at times a little uncomfortable but in a good way. I could see the ticking timebombs everywhere and felt the tension as things were about to bubble over. It's not a typical guy movie. These friends have alot of growing up to do and I feel like by the end of it, they've done just that over the course of the weekend. Wounds that were left years ago are torn open and finally given a chance to heal. The acting is top notch from everyone involved. If your a fan of Martin Cummins, David Hewlett or Ian Tracy, this is not a film you want to miss.",1245369600,,593,4.076923076923077
2415645,3,B000BF0D92,"Whoever thought that this movie should be classified gay, should have their thinking process re-examined. In my opinion, the main plot or story of this movie is very heterosexual. Perhaps because there is a bed scene between two guys classifies it as gay, but it is mostly about guys bonding and their relationships since kids.

The plot revolves about a weekend outing of five guys who grew up together somewhere in Canada. It is the 30th birthday of one of the guys. They go to a cabin in the woods, a place where they use to hang together as kids. The cabin is now owned by a very successful lawyer, who happens to have a brother who is invited by one of the other guys. This guy is a looser and hated by his brother.

There is a songwriter (whose birthday is being celebrated), a gym instructor (who is acting straight but deep inside he is not), and a failing photographer (who is open gay and lets them all know at the reunion. At least he is honest about himself.) The photographer and the gym instructor go at it one night in bed. The gym instructor resents the fact that it happened, he claims he was drunk, the other guy doesn't think so.

The story is basically about how screwed up these men lives are, whether  they are successful or not. The two brothers lives are closely examined and there seems to be a lot of flashback scenes on one of them dealing with a deer hunting trip with their father, whether he was forced to kill a dove to prove to be a man.

There is a lot drinking, inner soul searching, a lot of bickering and fighting among each other. A near drowning by the gambling brother (trying to commit suicide) brings them all back together at the end of the movie.

The movie was not a total disappointment but it is not what I expected. This is a mixed movie. May be some gay men can associate with this kind of material.",1199318400,4,1847,4.339130434782609
2415646,5,B000BF0D92,"Excellent script, dialog, cast, etc. The characters were fully believable and it's too bad the actors only had a two hour movie to explore them. Martin Cummins and David Hewlett were especially good as the up-tight, controlling Yuppie and the hapless musical screwup respectively. Maybe there'll be a sequel or something similar?

I'm just happy they set the story in Canada and then did NOT pretend it was Michigan or up-state New York.

Kudos.",1195689600,,445,5.0

2415648,1,B000BF0D92,The guys in this movie are miserable. And it makes me miserable watching them.,1175472000,,78,4.642857142857143
2415649,4,B000BF0D92,"Four friends plan a trip to a cabin in the woods to bask in the glory of their friendship and do some recreational drinking, hunting, and, turns out, have a little sex.  With the help from two unlikely surprise visitors:  one black sheep (and very troubled) older brother and one ex.

This film keeps you guessing all the way through and you'll do a little gasping, too, I think, as the story, and the back story, reveal themselves with a finesse that I seldom see.  One note, that this is hardly a ""gay movie"" as much as it has one gay character and, probably, one closet case.

First, the good:  Good acting, marvelous sequences of interaction, both verbal and otherwise, great sets, both indoors and out, lots of affecting snow and ice and cold (reminds me of the madness of The Shining) and enough baggage, secrets, and lies to fill a great novel.

Then, the bad:  Sound issues:  what are they saying, exactly?  (""Muddy,"" is what I would term the sound.) Sense of resolution:  pretty much, there is none.  I understand some viewers feeling cheated out of an ending, because the movie pretty much stops with very little resolved or concluded.  You get the sense these men will be stuck forever in their errant paths.  And that may be, actually, a logical conclusion for these characters that don't have ""enough guts"" to make a change.

But hope springs eternal, and I can project enough hope on these hopeless characters to carry the movie through for myself.  It's a wonderfully riveting hour and forty-five minutes that you won't soon forget.  You'll just have to fill in the blanks at the end for yourself.  It's not a bad thing.",1167609600,,1635,4.637630662020906
2415650,1,B000BF0D92,"Five self-indulgent p---- spend a weekend in the northen reaches of Canada. THERE IS NO STORY and there should be. The potential is here with good actors and an atmospheric location and cinematography.  However, in spite of replaying certain scenes over to see if I missed something no solid story evolved and none of the frustratingly convoluted vignettes ever amounted to anything.  This film fails to deliver. Worse still is the jumping into what should have been a powerful scene without any back story and no foreshadowing. For example:  1 The Sex Scene with Renee.  Suddenly one of the five men is having sex with another guy's wife.  But we have no idea if they even know one another let alone what lead up to the action. 2  The Through the Ice Scene.  One character is found having fallen through the ice (was it suicide we don't know for sure, but we do know that the character was self destructive?) the solidly frozen lake, where hours before five men had played ice hockey in a cleared portion, is suddenly seen an ice melt even though it is late in the day presumably freezing hard.  3 The Tantalizing Flashback Scene(s) from a child's POV, an adult hunting and carrying a rifle --  the father perhaps - but we are never told what happened or why it is important and how it affected the family. Too many lose ends and five characters that despite a wide variety of circumstances are unable to enlist any enthusiasm or pity or even laughter.",1140307200,13,1453,4.60077519379845
2415651,4,B000BF0D92,"Thom Best of 'Queer as Folk' directs this taut story by Michael MacLennan, a tale of how friendships since childhood are altered by life's flow and the difficulties inherent in attempting restoration.

Vaughn (Martin Cummins), distraught over being tossed by his ex Renee (Brandy Ledford), invites his three best friends to his snowbound cabin somewhere in Canada for a weekend of fun, hunting and drinking. Vaughn's parents are now dead and he has taken over the family cabin that held memories of his childhood, both the  good and bad aspects of it.  The three friends arrive: Jon (Greg Spottiswood) is now a gay man; Steve (hunky James Thomas) is a personal trainer involved with a demanding girlfriend whom he must call constantly to reassure; and Bryan (David Hewlett) an alcoholic songwriter and singer who is on the skids and whose wife is Renee's best friend.  Into this mix enters Vaughn's older estranged brother Trevor (Ian Tracey) who has spent his life gambling and comes to request his share of the brothers' inheritance to pay off gambling debts.  And to further complicate matters, Renee shows up to 'get her things' and flaunt her decision to leave Vaughn in front of his friends.

In this frozen setting each of the men unearths secrets and demons: no one is who they appear to have been as childhood friends.  There is a devastating schism between Vaughn and Trevor magnified by their childhood history of abuse by their hunter father, a sexual encounter between Jon and Steve that reveals much about each, and another sexual encounter involving Bryan and the visiting Renee that likewise brings the pot of ice boil over.  There are no resolutions: none are needed.  The story merely lets us observe the consequences of reunions with men whose lives have grown apart.

Well directed and beautifully photographed, the story unfolds in a slow but steady fashion that maintains our interest even though the characters (except for Trevor) are tropes to a degree. The one important criticism of this interesting film is the sound editor's problem: the conversations are often drowned in music or spoken so softly that the messages are indecipherable.  And that is a shame, because otherwise this is a credible story of how men interact when isolated together after years of life changes.  Grady Harp, December 05",1135468800,11,2326,4.981912144702842

8086018,4,B000BF0D92,I am a huge Hewett fan from his Stargate days and his own films. Great cast..liked the look of the film and I enjoyed it. Did it offer anything new to this type of storyline? Probably not but I liked it anyway. I like the idea of childhood friends getting together reminiscing...but I find I am not that person I was in my teens.
