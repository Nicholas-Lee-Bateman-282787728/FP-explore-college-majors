4216117,4,B003X9WOFE,I'm a big fan of Daniel Tosh. He's funny even when some people don't get what he's talking about. I love his quick wit & sarcasm on stage,1309824000,,137,3.9285714285714284

4216119,5,B003X9WOFE,Daniel Tosh looks like a nice young man you'd want your daughter to bring home to dinner ... until he begins talking and then you realize he's one warped individual. I laughed hard at this DVD many times throughout the hour long show. I'm glad the guy is tasting success ... he deserves it!,1302566400,3,290,4.388888888888889
4216120,4,B003X9WOFE,"Tosh is my favorite current comedian and his material almost always fails to disappoint. This is no exception. He's very witty and there's a lot to gather from his jokes even with a couple viewings. He's pretty mean for the average person, though.

Watch Tosh. 0 a few times to get a feel for his comedy. I have found his stand up has traditionally funnier than his stand up but I found ""Happy Thoughts"" to be about on par with some of the funnier Tosh. 0 episodes. ""Completely Serious"" is his best in my opinion but this is also some good comedy at a decent price.",1301788800,,565,4.330188679245283

4216122,5,B003X9WOFE,"After establishing a well known presence on his third season of Tosh. 0, Tosh is well on his way to becoming extremely wealthy. He is extremely talented and original, not afraid to be himself what so ever. He's a huge fan of the first amendent, addressing whatever comes to his mind in a extremely comical way. This stand up is his best material yet. He has an extremely successful future ahead of him. Watch Tosh. 0 till his next one.
This performance is worth every penny I paid for it. I'd give him 10 stars out of 5.",1300838400,,520,4.316326530612245
4216123,5,B003X9WOFE,"I knew that this would be good, & I wasn't disappointed. Daniel Tosh is hilarious! I love comedy that offends some people. Him & Patrice O'Neal do it VERY well. Chances are that you'll be offended by a joke or two. I also thought that a few of the jokes were very smart/clever. You might not care about that when it comes to comedy, but I appreciate it. I highly recommend this!",1299628800,3,378,4.263888888888889
4216124,3,B003X9WOFE,"I discovered Tosh with his CD ""True Stories I Made Up"" and really enjoyed the DVD ""Completely Serious"".  I enjoy his Tosh. 0 show, but it's starting to wear on me.  Like he says he knows the line between good and bad taste and crosses it a lot to visit distractingly offensive.  He seems to cross the line much more in season three (especially embracing the really disgusting) and the web redemptions feel stale.

The key to great comedy imo is reframing topics/points of view in humorous and truthful ways.  Very hard, but Tosh has a great wit about him.  Just don't experiment with the audience to see how offensive a bit can become instead of going for wit.  Brad Pitt and David Beckham creating a baby with a six-pack is funny...the next bit where Tosh imagines us wanting to ""rape"" the baby over and over lost me.  Yes, the baby is made up, but it's just too distractingly awful.  He has a decent bit regarding pro-choice, but then crosses way over the line into ""too uncomfortable to be funny"".

Chauvinistic comedians (both sexes) can be funny, and Tosh does the role well.  However, railing against his girlfriend starts out funny, but then goes to far.  In another bit, ""making it hail"" = funny, but always calling women whores or sluts gets tired.

Overall, comparing with earlier material, Tosh has progressed from lovable prick to outright mean.  He still has a load of talent, and I laughed a lot, but personally I appreciate some self-deprecation or at least being tricked into believing these jokes are not a personal credo.  If you are not rich, white, skinny, good-looking, and very liberal, you will be very, very offended.",1299542400,8,1641,4.688811188811189

4216133,5,B003X9WOFE,"I saw this first on TV and laughed so hard, I was crying.

I think Daniel Tosh is hilarious, however I don't watch Tosh. O much because of the video clips. I can't bear to watch bones break or the common Joe hurting himself with stupidity.  The best part of Tosh. O is when Daniel Tosh does his own thing - either interacting with one of the highlighted video people or making up something on his own (like his own Olympic attempt).

One day while flipping through the channels, I was treated by multiple episodes of Daniel Tosh's stand-up.  This episode was my favorite.  The images he paints in my head are fabulously funny.  :-).",1463788800,,632,4.452173913043478

4216179,5,B003X9WOFE,"When it comes to Daniel Tosh, I think to many look down upon him mainly for his crude, and outrageous humor. People now a days cannot take to hear the actual truth about themselves. People also are to scared to share how they really feel but Daniel Tosh actually has the nerve to say what people are thinking. I watch many stand ups and he does have a genius side that he shows. The way he keeps his cool and has the charm to still keep people liking and wanting more from even though he is making fun of everyone in the audience. America now a days cannot take any crap anymore. If you say one thing to anybody it's bullying, racist, sexist and whatever else. Everything is harassment and it's ridiculous. Tolerance these days is stupid. We all think inappropriate but everyone is scared to say anything, but I respect tosh for beig able to stand it. I understand not everyone will like him but talking down and bad about him makes no sense. He has his own style and is funny in his own way.",1388361600,,992,4.310160427807487
