2024389,5,B0001US7YA,Was looking for this film/play since I first saw it in the mid-eighties on a public programs station. Finally decide to check out Amazon and found it. A great addition for any Kevin Bacon fan. The storyline and all the actors in it are 100%.,1347840000,2,241,4.377777777777778
2024390,3,B0001US7YA,"Watching this movie is like going to work. It just takes too much effort to be comfortable/enjoyable. Part of this is undoubtably my own personal reaction to times and events that, perhaps, hit entirely too close to (my) reality.  I have never reacted to anything the way I react to watching or thinking about this movie. I guess that the most honest thing I can say is that the people that did this movie must have been very, very good to have managed to kick me in the gut that hard! Watch this, maybe it will make you too to think.

2024391,5,B0001US7YA,"From reading their reviews, the two reviewers posting negative reviews might have misunderstood the production. This isn't a movie, it's a video taping of a stage play.
CQ DX correctly states, ""Essentially if you set up a camera in the kitchen of a dysfunctional family, and let it run for 96 minutes...""  That's precisely how the play is staged.
The Director, Jan Eagleson, expanded on the basic staging with a set designed to allow cameras ""on stage"" to shoot movie-like closeup shots. Adding a few exterior shots and some unique camera points of view made this a very creative production of this Lanford Wilson play.

I appreciate this production may not have been what you were expecting.  Please judge it for what it is - a stage play on a custom designed set, video-taped to air on PBS's American Playhouse - not as a movie.

2024392,1,B0001US7YA,"Some movies should never have been made, and this is one of them!  Even 'Gigli' is way better and more entertaining than this BOMB!  The film is based on a play, and does not translate well to the film medium.  It is extremely BORING and TEDIOUS, and essentially takes place in a kitchen, living room, and bar.  You will have to sit through an hour and a half of inane dialogue that cures insomnia.  Yes, there are innovative visual lighting/panning film techniques, but they don't make up for this miserable excuse for a film.  I sat through this with my jaw agape, wondering if it would get better towards the middle or the end.  It didn't!  Essentially, if you setup a camera in the kitchen of a dysfunctional family, and let it run for 96 minutes, you would get this ridiculous movie.  It's no coincidence I found this DVD for three dollars in the 'bargain bin' at a major box retailer!  'Nuff said.",1229904000,5,903,4.484662576687117

2024395,5,B0001US7YA,"I cannot say enough good things about LEMON SKY.  It will change all preconceived ideas you may have about Kevin Bacon.  It is quite simply his best work.  But he's also given a beautiful script and equally up to the task ensemble.  (Where have you been Lindsay Crouse?!?!?!?)
I recently showed it to my students for playwriting and they were blown away.  Tears were streaming after.  It takes a seemingly simple story of a father/son relationship gone sour and lifts it to poetic heights.  Yes, it's that good.",1190246400,16,511,4.738636363636363
2024396,5,B0001US7YA,First film for Kevin Bacon & Kyra Sedgewick (that's where they met). Lemon Sky is a theatrical play filmed for TV-for American Playhouse on PBS. Director Jan Egleson made his career out of filming plays for TV. Unfortunately PBS lost funding for American Playhouse so we no longer can enjoy these productions at home. This is a pity because there are many good plays that people never get to enjoy. We are lucky to be able to see Lemon Sky whenever we'd like. It's a good story that alot of people can relate to. Its about a young man trying to deal with his father who left him when he was young.,1168300800,15,597,4.339285714285714
2024397,5,B0001US7YA,"I was afraid this production was obscure enough it would never make it to video or DVD. The sets, staging and props are fantastic and capture the feeling of late 1950's southern California perfectly but that's minor compared to the talented casts' performance which is beyond 5 stars.  It all comes together to create an amazing film that most are probably not aware of.
The DVD with its extras offers great insight into the making of this film.  ""The Making of Lemon Sky"" with director Jan Egleson takes you through the creative process from start to finish and lets you in on why the finished product is so captivating and moving.
This is Kevin Bacon at his best.  But the entire cast is riveting without exception.  If you haven't seen or heard of ""Lemon Sky"" treat yourself to a unique film experience.",1086134400,44,806,4.654929577464789

8016310,1,B0001US7YA,I am unsure why some like this as it is one of the worst movies I've tried to watch. I wanted to see it because this is the movie Kevin Bacon met his wife in. We stopped watching it about 1/2 way through as it was unbearable to watch.,1459382400,,234,3.795918367346939
