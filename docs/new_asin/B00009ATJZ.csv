1882970,5,B00009ATJZ,"This was the most intriguing, mind-boggling, and soul reaching show I've ever watched. I truly appreciate the people, who showcased it, and even more the ones who it was based upon. Thank-you, because that was as close to the corner, that I would ever get. Once again, I thank you all so much, because, personally, I never knew it was that hard for addicts. This is most definitely worthy of an Oscar. It would also, make good for more than a six episode t.v. series.",1076371200,2,467,4.5058823529411764
1882971,5,B00009ATJZ,Igrew up in Baltimore City and still live in Baltimore County! I have a brother who has gotten lost in this world..I could not believe the things how real they are. I also worked in the Hotel where most of the cast was staying including Charles Dutton.. What a great job,1072656000,,270,4.313725490196078
1882972,5,B00009ATJZ,"What an honest portrayal of how the corner really is, there is one in every city. It is very sad how America has this war on drugs that will never end. At least I don't see it. I grew up on a corner just like this one in Woodside Projects in Queens. Watching my mother become victim to the corner. Jumping out of cabs,stealing food for us to eat and why????? Because she wasn't aware of help or drug programs. Call this an excuse but really it is not. I truly believe if someone had reached out and touched my moms she would have been alright. That's why now that there are more educated young African-Americans we should give back to our corners. Educate the less fortunate,show them how to do better. If we don't take matters into our own hands ""THE CORNERS WILL KEEP ON GROWING""",1072224000,2,781,4.319727891156463
1882973,5,B00009ATJZ,"first I gotta give Charles S Dutton Much props.the Brother truly nailed it here.the Cast of this Show Knocked it out the Box. I can't think of another Mini-Series over the past Decade that has matched this Show in recent time.this Show had me locked in from the first show.truly High Quality of Writing,Acting&Direction. I can't even begin to tell you how sad I was when this Show ended on HBO because it truly captured so much for me&now it's on DVD&Now I can watch it Over&Over again. The Corner is On Point all the way.",1059091200,6,522,4.447916666666667
1882974,5,B00009ATJZ,"Like others reviewing this film I have been waiting a long time for this to be released and to have it come out on dvd is a real treat. This is the best depiction of in the hood drug addiction I have ever seen. It's real and not commercialized like Hollywood urban films are. It's not about gangs and thugs shooting each other up. It's about going against the odds and making the best out of the life that was given to us. I see this as an important document that makes you think and feel what it is like to be bound by addiction in more ways than one. Masterfully directed, there's something here for everyone to relate to. You don't have to be Black,you don't have to live in the hood, being human is enough to understand everything that goes on in this film. Very entertaining.",1055894400,37,780,4.277027027027027
1882975,5,B00009ATJZ,"Charles Dutton is so incredibly talented and you get to see how great this man is with this miniseries.  I love this series and although I did tape the series, I can't wait to run out and buy it.  Yippeee!!",1053561600,18,206,4.125
1882976,4,B00009ATJZ,"In THE END GAME and CORNER OF HELL the focus is on Lieutenant Gerard.  In the former, he pursues Kimble with his usual non-emotional vigor while in the latter, he is in the unaccustomed role as the pursued.  While in Chicago, Kimble is not aware that his picture is taken, and a copy of the picture naturally winds up in Gerard's hands, who immediately identifies the building in the photo and cordons off that section of the city. He and the local authorities begin a house-by-house search. Kimble, meanwhile has sought refuge in a house where two old men live Jake Devlin (John McGiver) and Sam Reed (John Fiedler).  Devlin and Reed are well aware of his identity and have long debated amongst themselves his guilt or innocence. At first, they are not sure what to do with him, but later they agree to help him escape.  Gerard is seen in a role that you do not often see him in.  He has to ask the local cops for manpower for the search.  He is given the needed men, but he is also give a deadline before these extra men will be withdrawn.  Gerard therefore is driven by the clock as much as he is by his need to catch Kimble.
Throughout this episode, Gerard radiates quiet confidence in his ability to apprehend KImble, who seems totally boxed in.  Gerard's confidence increases the suspense that perhaps this time Kimble will be caught.  Although Kimble does escape, Gerard remains nonplussed.  His basic world view of himself, society, and Kimble are unaltered.  However, in the second episode, CORNER OF HELL, Gerard, who still is the focus, must, by the end of this episode, admit to himself that his tidy world of a clear cut universe of right and wrong has changed in a way that makes him see for the first time that justice is an abstract concept, and its application sometimes cannot be summed up neatly on a wanted poster.  Gerard finds himself accused of assaulting a country woman in Louisiana, and he faces a lynching based only on circumstantial evidence.  It is Kimble who saves him from that mob.  This theme of role reversal has been done before, but not to the point where Gerard's view of justice has been shaken enough to admit, at least to himself, that sometimes justice is truly blind, not in the sense of its hoped-for impartiality, but in its unfair and sometimes just plain error-filled application.
Both episodes are a necessary addition to the video library of anyone who wants to better understand the nature of a cultural phenomenon that caused America to look at the statue with the blindfold and scales in a way that has proved unsettling to at least one doctor on the run.",1026172800,5,2607,4.602591792656588

1882981,3,B00009ATJZ,"While I enjoy looking into Baltimore drug culture and problems, the production is poorly put together. And while there are some really good talents in this show, they are relegated to bit parts and stupid lines. However, this is a good precursor to the HBO special, ""The Wire"". It was neat to see who (the good actors mentioned in bit parts) was rolled over into The Wire.
For the money, a good deal to look into a sad part of Baltimore's city history.",1515456000,,452,4.457831325301205

follows each key player in its own chapter, Charles Dutton's masterpiece should show up on TV once in a while. So it's
well worth the 25 or so dollars to own this gem. My pet peeve, why hasn't HBO released this in Blu-ray or at least wide screen DVD.
It is shown in full frame (1.33) surely this deserves better.",1469577600,,438,4.104651162790698

1883112,5,B00009ATJZ,"Another David Milch triumph.  Realistic to the core, exploring the themes prevalent in the life of the ""underclass.""  It was even more relevant as I just happened to get this right after the riots in Baltimore.  This was a pre-cursor to the excellent ""the Wire' (arguably the best TV series ever)- and between the Corner and The Wire, it's easy to understand the genesis of the riots.

This is television at it's best: gritty realism depicting life of the forgotten- educational and thought-provoking.  If you like The Wire, you'll like this.  If you haven't seen The Wire but appreciate programming that illuminates real life and the issues that confound urban living, you will love this and The Wire.  I'd recommend watching this before The Wire, just b/c The Corner gives a deep glimpse into the effects of drug abuse on individuals whereas The Wire is a much deeper look into the many aspects of urban life.",1439683200,,911,4.801282051282051

1883115,5,B00009ATJZ,"The Corner was a great HBO series that set the tone for The Wire series to follow. The Corner is about the McCullough family's struggle to survive in inner-city of Baltimore. This true-life story is raw and gritty, but it's realistic to the lives of many people who are living in poverty even to this day. The Corner addresses the pattern of drug-abuse and how it can start with one family member or friend, and influence an entire community. This was true of the McCullough family who started off in middle-class neighborhood, living a good life. The father, Gary McCullough, is a smart man with a good heart, but makes the wrong choices. Fran McCullough wasn't sure how to adapt to a middle-class life, and her impulsive behavior clashes with Garys. The lack of common ground on family values and morals ultimately leads the McCullough's down a destructive path. The battle to avoid the corners is an ongoing battle for America's war on drugs, but for a few members of the McCullough family, all hope may not be lost.",1436313600,6,1019,4.698324022346369

Some people say I will just try in on time with certain drugs it only takes one time and you're hooked. ALL  YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY NO! AND KEEP WALKING.,1392681600,,422,3.9176470588235293

It clearly depicts how it makes total liars and thieves as well as ruins the heart of these people. Absolutely tragic. These were normal, bright, responsible people until they tasted the hard stuff. It has it's own addictive power. Makes me hate the dope and addiction and not the drug addict. Clear evidence why they shud legalize all that stuff.

1883250,5,B00009ATJZ,"The Corner is based on real people and real events and was one of the strongest, most emotional mini-series I've ever seen. Playing almost like a documentary, these brilliantly directed six episodes take place over the course of one year and they combine to tell the story of a family living and surviving in a Baltimore ghetto along with some other residents of the neighborhood.

The Corner wasn't an easy show to watch, but it was absolutely enthralling. From the directing to the acting to the writing, I can't think of anything flawed about the show. The pain of the characters in this miniseries is tangible and the viewer feels that pain during every minute of every episode.

The subject matter is naturally depressing, but in a way it's not as depressing as the thought of a society content in sitting back and watching junk TV, happy as long as what's happening out there doesn't affect them and numb to the point of being blind that life as depicted in The Corner really does exist. The Corner is nowhere near as depressing as a society that allows conditions and lives like this to survive and flourish in our country.

I think to try and put the focus of the miniseries on drugs, or poverty, or on stereotypes, or to try and pass it off as exploitation is to really miss the point of the story, and to not realize that no matter who we are, we all deal with corners in our lives (admittedly without much of the tragic nature of the areas or the people represented in the series) is to miss part of the message.

The Corner is really a must-see miniseries that should be shown to our politicians and shown in our schools and shown in our living rooms. The Corner should be seen by everyone.

I mentioned the acting and in particular I think both Kandye Alexander and Clark Peters were absolutely amazing.

Some writers have a certain knack for being able to capture honest and emotional human interactions and dialogue. Raymond Chandler, Richard Price and George Pelecanos are just three that immediately come to mind and I have to add David Simon to the list as well. From Homicide: Life on the Streets, to The Wire, to The Corner, Simon proves himself capable of taking his audience directly inside the minds and souls of the characters he writes about. The downside to that is that it's not always a pleasant place to be.

A random scale of 1 to 5 doesn't do justice to a piece of work like The Corner.",1297814400,,2417,4.529816513761468

1883253,5,B00009ATJZ,"""We sitting here day after day making ourself a little bit less human."" -- Gary McCullough

After watching this six-part 2000 HBO miniseries, I have to say that it is one of the most powerful, moving films I have ever experienced. Compassionately directed by actor Charles S. Dutton and written by David Simon and Edward Burns (creators of ""The Wire""), every performance here is deeply moving and powerfully acted. Based on a real-life family from Baltimore, and the friends and neighborhood they are from, this miniseries deals with the horrors of drug addiction in a more realistic way than perhaps any movie or TV series ever has. You feel like you are right there in the middle of this horror, as the series takes an intimate, documentary-like approach. You have to keep reminding yourself that these are all actors playing a part. This would be a powerful series even if it was completely fictional. The fact that every character actually exists in real life just makes it that much more riveting.
T.K. Carter's heartbreaking portrayal of Gary McCullough is one of the most poignant acting performances ever captured on film. Gary was once an extremely intelligent and successful stock market wizard who abhorred drugs and worked hard for his money. The fact that he eventually falls into a life of heroin abuse, and loses everything, most of all his dignity, is particularly sad. In every scene, you see a broken man with a look in his eyes that says, ""how did I get myself into this mess?"" Out of all the people whose lives are documented in this series, he seems to be the one you are pulling for the most. Carter captures the true essence of a man who is clearly not cut out for this kind of life, knows he is worth much more than this, but seems unable to stop himself from falling deeper into the abyss that has also claimed everyone around him. It's a truly shattering performance that will leave you in tears.
Khandi Alexander and Sean Nelson, who play his ex-wife and son, also give deeply moving performances, as does everyone in the cast. Glenn Plummer's portrayal of ""Blue"" is also worth noting, as he struggles to get himself out of his own battles with addiction.
You keep praying for everyone to pull themselves out of this self-created hell, but only a few are able to do so. Some are so far gone, you are amazed they have made it this far in life. They are truly ravaged souls, physically and mentally.
After the film is over, Dutton interviews some of the real-life counterparts, and you can see the hopefulness they convey, but also a lot of the emotional scars and demons they still carry with them.
This is one series that should be seen by everyone. It shows the absolute devastation and unrelenting destruction that drugs (whether doing them or selling them) will cause. It does it in a way that is not melodramatic or glamorized but simply realistic. It's bleak but manages to remain hopeful in the wake of all this human carnage.
You'll find yourself choked up but I guarantee it will stay with you for a long time to come. In a word: brilliant.",1289174400,,3075,4.6525735294117645

I feel that The Corner is actually better than The Wire.  The Corner takes place in Baltimore where a street corner is run by teenage men selling drugs.  The adults seem to be drug addicts and hopeless most of the time and the younger set seem to be sellers and abusers.  One family is unique.  The parents had good jobs and the father had one year of college - amazing in these parts.  The mother became an abuser and partier of cocaine and eventually the father took to herion.  His explanation is that the people doing drugs around him including his wife were criticizing him and encouraging him to do it.  He thought people would like him better if he abused drugs too.  Unfortunately, they liked him less.  A young girl at 13 has a baby.  The young man doesn't go to school or work, he hangs on the corner.  All this is based on real story and ring true.

1883279,5,B00009ATJZ,"There's a scene right at the end of episode three titled ""Fran's Blues"", where Charles S. Dutton is talking to Baltimore Police Officer Robert Brown (played by Brian O'Neill). Officer Brown says he's sad about how the neighbourhood has changed over the years due to drugs. ""The rot started in the projects,"" Brown says, and then it ""Just kept creeping uphill."" Dutton asks Brown if he ever feels like he's wasting his time, given the number of people the city locks up every year only a fraction of who get ""prison time"". Brown doesn't seem to think so, replying that there are still good people in the neighbourhood, ""Church people, working people"", who want to see the drug scourge end. Duttom then asks Brown if he thinks the war on drugs will ever be won? There's a long pause. The officer looks everywhere but at the camera and, after what seems like an age, finally says: ""No comment.""

Fans of ""The Wire"" (of which this series is a very close relation) will also recall a scene where it's implied by one of the characters that the war on drugs isn't being fought with any conviction because if it was and was eventually won, well, then local politicians wouldn't have anything to campaign about, would they? And then let's not forget the very strong belief among social commentators and observers both black and white, that narcotic drugs were brought into the black community by the CIA to ensure black folk remained a permanent underclass. Why do I bring all this up? I bring it all this up because these are the issues that came up for me while watching this powerful series. More than anything else, I came away feeling amazed that we live in a society that has allowed such incredible suffering to go on, on such a massive scale, for so long.

The six-part series is very cleverly directed by Charles S. Dutton to look like it was part documentary and part drama with skilfully added in flashbacks. In just six one-hour episodes it explores a wide range of social issues such as urban deprivation, poverty, family breakdown and teenage pregnancy but the focus is really the psychology of drug addiction and the despair of people caught up in it, particularly the McCullough family: Dad Gary (played by T.K. Carter), Mom Fran (played by Khandi Alexander) and two sons DeAndre and DeRodd (played by Sean Nelson and Sylvester Lee Kirk respectively). The series poses a lot of interesting and crucial questions about the so-called war on drugs that so far, I haven't heard any real-life politicians seriously address. Ever.

The series is from the same brains behind similarly Baltimore-focused shows as ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and of course ""The Wire"". I know a couple of Baltimore residents personally and while all fans of these shows, they do have mixed feelings about them. I can understand why. Other shows supposedly based in other cities like New York's ""Law & Order"", Los Angeles' ""The Shield"" or Las Vegas' ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" are all very well produced, directed and acted, (not to mention popular world-wide), but they are also very obviously works of fiction. This crop of shows on the other hand are based on non-fiction books. ""The Corner"" is based on ""The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood"", a non-fiction book by David Simon and Edward Burns and ""The Wire"", though largely written by Simon and Burns, is based on the non-fiction book ""The Wire: Truth Be Told"" by Rafael Alvarez. Even ""Homicide"" was based on a non-fiction book. They are thus so very close to the truth of what life is like on the streets of Baltimore. Or so I'm told. I can understand how that could make some people uncomfortable. Almost like they and their city are being put under a microscope.

In any event, one question that never seems to get answered via any of these shows and always seems to get glossed over is why these people get into drugs in the first place. We're told that Fran lost her sister and turned to drugs to ease the pain but no more is said on the subject. Personally, I'd have liked to find out what it was about Fran or any of the other drug addicts in the series and/or what it was about their lives that made drugs so attractive an option as an escape?

Also, these drugs are not manufactured on the streets of Baltimore so how do they get there? And where do they come from? I feel until we get shows that begin to focus on some of the root causes of the world's drug epidemic today, all we'll ever get is very entertaining shows that mainly serve to make us voyeurs on other people's tragic sadness.

But the emphasis is definitely on 'very entertaining'. I watched the entire series over two days, three episodes a sitting and then watched them all over again. As sad as the stories are, they were fun to watch. It was so much fun to see many of the same actors from the current season of The Wire on this too, people like Lance Reddick, Maria Broom, Clarke Peters, Reg E. Cathey; all incredibly versatile and talented artistes. Finally, it was also great to see (at the end of the final episode) the real-life people behind the story and find out how they felt about being portrayed on film in this way. They didn't seem to mind and the real Fran Boyd expressed the hope that seeing how bad her life on drugs was, might encourage other drug addicts to get help.

I hope so too.

I know this is long-winded and may seem more like an essay than a review of a DVD but I just don't think it's enough to review something this significant with generic praise like ""Great work by Charles S. Dutton!"" (Even though it is) or ""T.K. Carter's performance was stunning!"" (Even though it was) or ""Sean Nelson was great!"" (Even though he was) or ""Khandi Alexander shines!"" (Even though she does). In my view, this winner of 3 Emmys is a body of work that is much greater than the sum of its parts, as fantastic as those parts are. This series makes me think and it makes me wonder. Not many TV series can do that.

But then, this isn't TV. It's HBO.",1172534400,25,6004,4.556997219647822

1883281,5,B00009ATJZ,"Before viewing this miniseries, I had only read the book (of the same name) by David Simon and Edward Burns published in 1997. Still, the world of decaying neighborhoods, the havoc of street drugs and  hopelessness among the disadvantaged has deepened in the Bush era.  It took an ingenious director like Charles Dutton to recount one family's troubled history  gripping miniseries that doesn't miss a beat. And he's selected a cast of relative unknowns who assume their roles with dead-on realism

The film follows a year in the life of one impoverished family against the backdrop of their neighborhood during the 1990's a drug-ridden quarter-mile from Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Dutton, like Simon and Burns, dwells on the humanity of his cxharacters and the universal themes of their day-to-day struggles. You needn't have been an alcoholic or drug addict to enter the hearts of these people or understand how they swing between hope and hopelessness.

As political commentary, THE CORNER couldn't be more timely, especially in its grasp of urban education, inner city commmunties, underage pareenthood and America's Dickensian juvenile  justice system. Viewing what these potentially gifted people endure, viewers may ask how many good people we discard because of our cultural myopia, institutional racism and apathy.

The core performance here is T.K. Dutton's ""Gary"" -- the father of his broken family. The ways in which he struggles to overcome present shame in light of past success is something most of us will recognize -- race aside -- if not today, then tomorrow.

There is no score to speak of except for Corey Harris's blues track which occurs on splash screens and during the credits for each of six episodes. Dutton frames each episode with interviews of different principal characters to evoke the feel of a documentary, and he more than succeeds.

Dutton understands the lives of these characters because he grew up in their neighnorhood and experienced first-hand the dissolution of life on these corners -- where red tops and spider bags are the basis of life and death. He knows that the pain of addiction is potent, but not always as devastating as the cruelties of the real world ""clean.""

Every facet of this production suggests HBO should rebroadcast THE CORNER  on its tenth anniversary.  You wil laugh, weep, wince and cheer; and when it's over, you will hate to leave these good people.

While there are segments that are bleak, Dutton didn't intend to shock. He wanted to remind us that these men and women are fully human, and that --like Gary-- we have the potential to stumble, too. We might be doomed to the Corner but for the grace of God.

But once I started watching, I could not stop. As the series came to an end, I eagerly awaited for all the awards shows to herald this monumental piece of work. There is no doubt that Charles S.

I would especially recommend this series to anyone with children, it is a real eye opener!!!!!!",1103587200,2,1210,4.488584474885845
1883293,5,B00009ATJZ,"From the  brilliant cinematography to the superb acting, to the horrifying scenes of the streets of the crime-infested, drug-infested cesspool of inner-city Baltimore, this HBO miniseries takes viewers deeper into ghetto life than they could previously imagine.  They development of the characters is incredible and by the end of the 6 hour show you will feel like you have experienced what they have been through.  It is a moving, provacative, and emotional ride that will stick in your mind long after you live it.",1100476800,5,516,5.119047619047619
1883294,5,B00009ATJZ,"I have to preface this review by saying that the book this series is based on is one of my all-time favorites and I usually don't expect much out of movies based on books. However, this is one rare example of a miniseries that stayed very true to the book it is based on and which portrays the events as they actually occurred. There was only one inconsistency I noticed and that was when Gary McCullough stole some money from Andre. In the book, Fran was the one who actually stole from her son (several times).

The look and feel of ""The Corner"" is very gritty and raw and will leave some viewers feeling uneasy but I am glad that they didn't try to glamorize what is anything but glamourous.  I applaud those in charge of the makeup...they did a great job making the skin lesions and open sores of the addicts look realistic.  I thought the actors all portrayed their respective characters extremely well. I was particularly impressed with Clarke Peters and TK Carter's performances (as Fat Curt and Gary). They both did a fantastic job at showing us not every addict fits the stereotype of a ""low-down dirty dope fiend"" and that they still have the capacity to be intelligent, caring people with aspirations just like everyone else.  Charles S. Dutton was the perfect person for the role of director, as he is a Baltimore native and also a former inmate.  I was impressed that there were no lame/cheesy attempts to earn the audience's sympathy, as we often see directors do with other films in this genre.  The story was presented as true to the real-life events as possible without over-dramatization.

Be sure to pay attention to the final scene when Charles Dutton interviews the real Fran and Andre.  The happiness you will feel for Fran's success will be quickly overshadowed by the sadness at Andre's outcome.  I wish there was some way to find out how he is doing today and if he's still on the corner.

If you enjoy this miniseries, I highly recommend that you read the book - it goes into greater depth and will permanently change the way you view inner-city blight.  You may also want to check out ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", a top-rated police drama based on another of Simon's books, as well as Simon's HBO series ""The Wire"" which includes several of the actors from ""The Corner"".",1097020800,5,2301,4.615196078431373
1883295,5,B00009ATJZ,"I really enjoyed watching the show because is brought how the truth about American cities. Growing up me Moter was a victim to a crack addiction. She died when I was 10. My family sent me to live with my Father who dealed crack (was the one that got my Mother hooked) until he was later guned down in Newport News, VA behind a drud deal gone bad. After being sent to live with my brother. When I was 17 he was shot to death in a drive by. This made me want to do good with my life and this series really touched me. To everyone that was behind this movie, Big up. Mabe a show should spin out of this.",1079395200,5,600,3.9262295081967213
1883296,5,B00009ATJZ,"Every time this series runs on HBO Signature, I can't help but be drawn in.  It's one of those things you can watch over and over, wanting to look away from the graphic depiction of heroin use, but unable to tear yourself away.  What Dutton and the producers/screenwriters have done is to bring a human face to addiction, something that is rarely seen.  The central character of Gary is at the same time sweet, tragic, and hopeless.  He is an intelligent, vibrant man, once so successful but now numbed by his addiction.  What is even all the more heartbreaking is that these are/were real people, not just a fictional concept.  It also goes to show the viewer that no one is completely safe from addiction; if someone like Gary can come so close to success only to have it all fall away, anyone can walk down that same road.  I also HIGHLY recommend the book this miniseries was based on, although it is very lengthy.  What is ironic is that I grew up in an affluent suburb only an hour away from where The Corner took place, and until I read the book and saw the miniseries, I had no idea that places this stark and brutal actually existed.  No matter what walk of life you come from, you can appreciate and be affected by this story.  All you have to be is human.",1077667200,4,1266,4.371794871794871

It clicks in all aspects, story, acting, etc.",1518739200,,352,4.115942028985507
