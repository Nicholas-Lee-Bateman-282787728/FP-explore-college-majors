8123896,3,B000FK7YUO,"In 2004 AAN: MEN AT WORK came on six months after and tried to hitch onto KHAKEE's gravy train. But while both films are action-packed crime thrillers, AAN lacked the polished scriptwork and strong acting performances that made KHAKEE a Bollywood box office hit. Akshay Kumar starred in both films, and he's decidedly more somber in AAN and not as much fun. It doesn't help that AAN so very obviously cribs from John Woo.

It's an often regurgitated premise, that of the supercop assigned to clean up a corrupt town. For a while now the Mumbai police force has been under siege, unable to cope with the Mumbai crime syndicate's stranglehold on the city. The underworld bhai - which means ""brother,"" or as applied in this context, ""don"" - Yusuf Pathan (an intense Irfan Khan) is funded by a business magnate (Jackie Shroff) and protected by none other than the Home Minister himself. The local constabulary finds itself handcuffed, its roster peppered with traitors and shirkers and homicidal hotheads. Veteran Sr. Inspector Vikram Singh (Shatrughan Sinha), once a dedicated peacekeeper, has given up. Constable Khaled Ansari (Paresh Rawal) generates welcome levity in the precinct but struggles to provide for his family with his meager pay. Sub-Inspector Appa Kadam Naik (Sunil Shetty) is a loose cannon, an ""encounter specialist"" who hangs his hat on capital punishment. In fact, he tends to apply capital punishment on them villains he encounters. These police officers are all fighting a losing battle.

Half an hour into the film, Akshay Kumar strolls on camera in one of those extended, elaborate intro sequences in which he demonstrates his action hero creds (Sunil Shetty got the same treatment earlier). And I will say that while the fighty fights aren't that original, they're so energetic and over-the-top that I think they're sort of neat. The violence achieves this cartoony feel. Akshay, before he got into modeling and acting, used to study martial arts and so he's able to look convincing in his high-octane scraps.

Akshay plays Hari Om Patnaik, a young DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police) transferred from Poona and now in charge of the Mumbai crime branch. DCP Patnaik lives by his own unbreakable moral code. Believing that a fellow cop was extending a bribe, he roars: ""It's all about sacrifice and honor!"" DCP Patnaik has sort of got that wide-eyed Elliot Ness streak in him. Part of the narrative concerns how his naivet clashes with the practical administration of his job. It's hard to get things done - it's hard to put away the crooks - when you're hamstrung not only by the corruption within the police force but by your own unrealistic set of rules. Idealism eventually gets kicked to the curb.

The cast turns in good performances, with Sunil Shetty surprisingly a stand-out. But I can't help but compare AAN to KHAKEE, and KHAKEE's cast simply outshines this one. Also, the storytelling in AAN keeps getting undermined by incessant musical numbers which feature gyrating hotties. I guess there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. After a while, even I'd had enough of women being objectified. Atypical to Bollywood, romance is relegated to the sidelines, with Lara Dutta and Raveena Tandon pretty much just twiddling their thumbs. Because there's nothing in the script that merits pointing out, I return to the action beats, which are pretty much the only bits I found halfway entertaining. They're done to such ridiculous extremes that even Hong Kong stuntmen are calling bullshucks. But give the khaki-clad leads their due. They're trying to sell it as hard as they could. Only, DCP Hari Om Patnaik must flaunt Neo-like skills to be caught inside a circle of goonish gunmen who blast away enthusiastically and yet fail to tag him. An average 2.5 out of 5 stars for AAN: MEN AT WORK. Akshay's done better.",1330300800,2,3846,4.939721792890262
