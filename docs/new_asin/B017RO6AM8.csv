7512762,2,B017RO6AM8,"A CG earth is struck by a CG comet leaving behind green glowing embers that causes wolves and dogs to get their own ideas about animal rescue. As pets turn wild, only Rosalyn (Tristin Mays) the unlikely daughter of two very white adults, knows how to use a knife to fight off canines.

This is made for TV movie in the SyFy  unofficial series of "" Making fun of classic novels.""  ""Night of the Comet"" would have been a better name, but it was already done and better.

I just didn't feel the terror. A film you can watch for free on TV and then forget.",1451692800,5,552,4.179245283018868
7512763,4,B017RO6AM8,"It's pretty corny and cheesy, but I thought it was a fun way to spend some time. The dog actors did quite well. The cgi dogs were pretty bad, but what else would you expect from a syfy movie?",1464307200,,191,3.923076923076923
7512764,1,B017RO6AM8,"OMG....are you kidding me or what??? It wasn't made in the 1980s so you can't blame it on the era. The movie had several decent actors such as Kelly Rutherford and Tristin Mays, but that doesn't matter when the plot and every single action sequence is absolutely ridiculous and down right improbable. So pathetic that the suspension of disbelief just goes out the window. I mean every single...every single character acts like a brainless moron, who does the exact opposite of what they should do and continues to make even dumber mistakes. Forget the hot airhead female leads that are always made to look like they have the IQ of a gerbal, all the characters are morons.

This movie didn't just have me rolling my eyes or laughing, I was literally yelling at the characters on the screen because they and the scenes were just that aggrevating. Trust me, unless you watch it on SyFy Channel or some other tv channel late one night when you can't sleep...forget about it, it's that bad. I won't even go into the pathetically stupid and boring ending. Lol. Don't waste your money.",1463443200,2,1078,4.703703703703703
7512765,1,B017RO6AM8,This movie was ok I wish the did a better job at the ending like killing all the dogs that would be a better way to end a dog horror movie but since they didn't do that it was ok not the best I will only give it one star since the ending was poor and bad,1462406400,,254,3.473684210526316
7512766,4,B017RO6AM8,"I rented this last night, and thought it was actually pretty funny. The characters were pretty dumb, you can see that the actors are wearing those dog bite sleeves. They have dogs with blood everywhere trying to sound vicious with growling noises played throughout, but they look cute and like they're playing around. The story is like something out of an old 80's horror movie; a meteor lands in a small town, breaking into several parts. The pieces give off a green glow and loud screeching sound, making all the dogs in town attack and kill anyone human. One family tries to survive the carnage and make it out alive. If you love bad cheesy movies and dogs, you might enjoy NIGHT OF THE WILD!!!",1462320000,,697,4.584

Ok for one thing they started to attack in day light and some of the dogs were in different locations they should of have the dogs catch something like rabies because I don't believe dogs would attack do to sound that I no of.

7512773,3,B017RO6AM8,O'kay this movie was good BUT what happened to NASA or somebody from the government coming to find out about the metero's fallen from the sky (huh) and these people must've been blind or something cause NOBODY seen not one space rock other than that the movie was very entertaining to watch.,1457827200,,291,4.615384615384615
7512774,3,B017RO6AM8,"I saw this on the Syfy Channel so I knew what I was getting.  The plot is unchallenging; most of the scenes feature repetitive attacks by bad dogs gone meteor-mad.  Theres a lot of squirming and screaming and spurting blood.  One of the killer dogs is a guide dog who manages to appear simultaneously all over town and far out into the countryside.  If they had bothered to take its harness off this would have been less noticeable (but still improvable).  Grown men were taken down by a single hound while Kelly Rutherford managed to fight off multiple dogs attacking her multiple times.  Some of this wouldnt have happened but for a disobedient daughter.  What passes for suspense is a lot of abrupt editing and extreme close-ups.  Naturally, the dogs takeover the world!!!

Its kooky, silly, and if you are of the right mind, quite fun.  But it is pretty awful.  I don't know why Rob Morrow felt compelled to take this job, I cant imagine the money was that good seeing as it looks as if the budget was a buck fifty for everything including the script, the dogs, and the gay porn star who served as the Line Producer as well as playing a farmer with cows to spare.",1457827200,4,1167,4.483412322274882

7512780,3,B017RO6AM8,"Some beautifully trained dogs, a halfway decent plot, and some not so terrible acting make this a decent movie to have on in the background while working.
What is hilarious is that the closed captioning periodically stops running and then switches back and forth from Night of the Wild to some unknown film. Subtitles about getting ready for a date being displayed while a woman and little girl are trying to escape from a pack of dogs that wants to eat them lends this flick an impressive level of farce.
If I thought the subtitle thing was intentional, I'd 5 star it for being very meta.",1457049600,,589,4.566037735849057

8740064,3,B017RO6AM8,"RELEASED TO TV in 2014 and directed by Eric Red, Night of the Wild chronicles events in a small American town after a meteorite shower causes canines to go crazy. Rob Morrow, Kelly Rutherford, Tristin Mays & Carmen Tonry play the family trying to escape the carnage.

The extremely low-rated reviews are inaccurate and are obviously knee-jerk reactions to this being an Asylum movie. While Asylum movies CAN suck, this one is pretty good for what it is, a made-for-TV creatures-run-amok flick. Actually, Night of the Wild is relentless almost from the get-go with the various canine attacks, the final act going into overdrive. It could even be argued that the horror is so unremitting that the movie is one-dimensional. For the most part, the dogs are real canines and the movie commendably depicts them in a convincingly ferocious manner, which is reminiscent of 1981s Wolfen. They coulda done better with the women, however. Yet Mays is pretty stunning in a semi-exotic way and Mary Katherine O'Donnell is quite fetching, although the latter doesnt last long. The score is actually quite moving.

The only reason Im NOT giving this a more recommendable rating is because of the dumb things people do during the attacks, the precise opposite of what they should do. For instance, two people leave the sure shelter of the second story room of a house to go back outside where dogs are on the prowl practically everywhere. Or when two people hide under a truck, like the dogs wouldnt be able to perceive them or get to them (rolling my eyes). Also a certain person is seriously attacked in two episodes, but escapes pretty much unscathed. If you can handle these kinds of plot flaws Night of the Wild delivers for what it is, a Grade B nature-runs-amok flick.

THE FILM RUNS 89 minutes and was shot in Slidell & New Orleans, Louisiana, with establishing shots in presumably California. WRITER: Delondra Williams .

8740066,5,B017RO6AM8,"Night of the Wild. 8 out of 10. Asylum films get a bad rap. Quite correctly in many cases. But what is up with the hate for this film? I mean really what more could you want from a nature goes wild movie? It has decent practical effects, Ive seen worse CGI effects, none of the acting is visibly risible, and the action doesnt let up.

Giant green meteors land in a rural California village or perhaps the Hamptons with mountains it wasn't all that clear. This causes all the dogs to go crazy apparently through meteor sound if the one deaf dog is to be believed. This makes zero sense. The fact that the characters don't notice the giant green glowing things is a running bizarre zero sense thing throughout the movie as well. In fairness to the characters, I am pretty sure the meteors were not actually there when filming but were added in post-production with The Asylums magical Commodore 64.

I recently viewed the similar themed The Pack. The Pack is on the surface a much better film. It has better cinematography, scarier looking dogs, an actual plot and most importantly it stars ridiculously attractive Anna Lise Phillips. Night of the Wild has Housewives star, Jill Zarin. (Who in all fairness isn't all that bad in a limited role as a chew toy). But the Pack has fewer cast members than Night of the Wild has kills in the first ten minutes. Night of the Wild knows why we watch a nature gone wild movie. It isn't for story and pacing and a rumination on the struggles of rural America.

Night of the Wild is a fun movie that knows it is fun and simply goes about its business. It isn't obnoxiously self-referential and it is completely lensed with a surprisingly good pace. Well worth the watch.",1488153600,2,1708,4.503225806451613
