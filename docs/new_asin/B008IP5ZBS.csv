And some of the tips he uses were creative!! I like very much about this video but the reason for 4 star is this video only shows conceptual sculpting process. Not polished as maquett. Wish it included that too! But overall It was good lesson for me!",1405641600,3,506,4.3936170212765955
8528555,5,B008IP5ZBS,"I've been trying to learn some traditional sculpting practices after a number of years using digital tools and hoped this would be worth dropping some dollars on as these Stan Winston school dvd's are anything but cheap. I've rewatched it a couple of times now though and I'm still learning new things so I think this was a good investment for me.

The tutorial keeps a clear focus on the process of roughing out a 'scene' that Simon would use as a proof of concept to validate spending more substantial time on a subject in the eyes of his director. So the focus is on mood and character and on creating a dynamic scene in a short amount of time. This doesn't mean the viewer is deprived of seeing the meaty 'last 10%' of the design being articulated though, there is an impressive level of detail and finish shown despite the focus being clearly on 'proof of concept' style constraints.

For someone new to traditional sculpture this dvd gave me almost everything that I wanted. It introduced me to the tools, the materials and the workflow within a clear set of restrictions and it clearly explained the philosophy of the choices that were made in each case. I learned about the strengths of Clay and how to use armature in a new way than I had previously in other tutorials.

Also, some interesting use of a blowtorch and oven toaster to maintain clay soft enough to be worked quickly before being countered with cold compressed air was a little trick of the trade that I expect would only be learnt when deadline driven speed was required. I felt that Simon was an interesting and grounded speaker as well as an accomplished tradesman, I'd pick up more of his dvd's without worrying about the money next time.

The only downside for me was that the dvd ended. It's a really cool fight scene between the Alien and the Predator and I would have liked to see him take it further than the job required, add in some backgrounds, detail everything out fully and then paint it up. There are other dvd's in the Stan Winston school that cover these stages individually though.",1353628800,8,2072,4.576819407008086
