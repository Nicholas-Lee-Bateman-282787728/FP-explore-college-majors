2248960,4,B0007XG4GE,"While the level of Seasons Six and Seven is not anywhere as consistently good as the earlier seasons, there is much to appreciate. Season Six's episode ""Finnegan's Wake"" is perhaps the best stand-alone episode of the series, and Season Seven offers the taut and moving ""Lines of Fire"" and, of course, the last words of Clark Johnson at the end of the last episode, bringing the series full circle from the first words of the first episode.",1115337600,4,439,4.714285714285714
2248961,5,B0007XG4GE,"OK, I've scanned these reviews for snippets of info about Season 7. Channel 4 here in the UK dumped the show unceremoniously, after p***ing off every other fan by fannying around with the late night schedule, yadda yadda yadaa. Yes it was an outrage. But I digress.

I've pur-chased 1-6 and am now in the mid-6 post-Mahoney scandal, the whole Georgia Ray saga, which I enjoyed first time around too. Kellerman's tight wound performances are a joy to behold.

I look forward to seeing how Season 7 turns out. Pembleton's departure doesn't sound like too big a deal. It's an ensemble show after all, though how that pans out we'll have to wait and see.

But I have realised just how strong some of the earlier Seasons were - I can see me going back to the beginning all over again...

RATING seems to be mandatory so I've given it the only one I can.",1113782400,6,848,4.451612903225806
2248962,4,B0007XG4GE,"Many fans and critics derided season seven of ""Homicide"" for one reason: the loss of Andre Braugher, who had felt that the character of Pembelton had been taken as far as possible.  While it is disappointing to have ""Homicide"" without him, season seven is capable of standing on its own.

Cast Biographies

While not exactly ""loaded"" with extras, this final season set is a necessary addition to any fan's collection, if only for the addition of Giancarlo Esposito and the unresolved plotline of the relationship between Gee and Mike which comes to a head in the movie.

Full of ups and downs, season seven isn't the greatest, but it was television at its finest, and no show has come close to achieving what ""Homicide"" did from beginning to end: tell gripping stories with a well-developed cast of characters that entertained for seven short years.",1113264000,31,1853,5.039735099337748
2248963,5,B0007XG4GE,"In answer to the views of the obvious soap opera fan, how anyone could prefer the later charactors to the early crew, is truly beyond me. A true Homicide fan knows what made this the great show that it was, and that wasn't some hunky pritty boy actor, and the pat writing from those who came late to the writing staff. I have the first 6 seasons, and look forward to 7, even without Frank around the squadroom. It will be great to see the round up of the Bo Felton charactor,Daniel Baldwin. I just wish it would come out now...",1112572800,7,527,4.227722772277228
2248964,2,B0007XG4GE,"Homicide died the moment that Andre Braugher left the show. The slippage was showing during Season 6, but there were still a lot of moments to watch. The addition of Michael Michele was horrible. She's such a lightweight actress, even being too wretched for ER.  The Ballard/Falsone romance was pointless, and went against the grain of the show's earlier tone.  As for Bayliss's bisexuality--the Big Man would shudder. And what was up with repainting the squad room blue? Or, as Pembleton would remark in the movie finale: ""Cerulian."" Of course, we completists will buy this set, if only to recall how far this show fell from greatness.",1111449600,11,636,4.934579439252336
2248965,3,B0007XG4GE,"The final season of Homicide :Life on the Street was a shadow of the show's former brilliance. Not that it isn't worth watching mind - I daresay most of the episodes on here would hold up reasonably well against most other shows - but with Pembleton & Kellerman gone there wasn't really much to hold the show together (Although Kellerman does reappear in two episodes as a Private Eye who becomes embroiled in a Homicide case.). All Ballard, Stivers and Sheppard seemed to do in this season was whine how the guys didn't treat them as equals - it's as though Kay Howard never existed. There are bright spots though. I still say that ""Lines of Fire"" is one of the ten best episodes of the series. ""Homicide.com"" sees the series final major story arc,which sees Sheepard catch a particularly nasty red ball in the form  of Internet Killer Luke Ryland, and will eventaully culminate in a shocking turn of events that takes place in ""Homicide:The Movie."" (out now on DVD). Law and Order SVU star Chris Meloni makes a guest appearence in the two parter ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"", and there is also the second part of the final Law and Order crossover, ""Sideshow"".

You still nedd to own this though, on the basis that once you've seen the first six seasons, you'll want to own this just to complete your set. But in terms of the series itself, it's a sad end to what for me is the greatest television show ever made.",1110499200,13,1408,4.517647058823529
2248966,5,B0007XG4GE,"This was (with aplologies to Jack Webb) probably the best police procedural show ever. It was well written and had and excellent ensemble cast and being set in Baltimore was a nice and very welcome change from the usual cop show set in New York or Los Angeles. This is the final season and while I saw it several years ago in the stores it has been very hard to find since and was very expesive when available, but Amazon had it and at an excellent price.",1394668800,,455,4.241379310344827
2248967,4,B0007XG4GE,"Some people may disagree with me, but I think the last season of Homicide: Life on the Street is good.  All the actors and actresses gave good performances and I was sorry when the series came to an end.  I would have like to have seen Falsone and Ballard get back together, though.  I always like romance in a drama to keep it from being too serious.  If you're a fan of the series, you need this season in your personal library.",1368057600,,430,4.2073170731707314
2248968,5,B0007XG4GE,"We are in the process of watching the complete series and it's awesome, so realistic with some brilliant actors.

2248969,5,B0007XG4GE,As a resident actor of the Washington-Baltimore area I had the pleasure of working on this high quality TV series.  It was good to be able to revisit the various episodes that were not only well written and produced but also filled with friends of the local film community,1294617600,,272,4.551020408163265
2248970,5,B0007XG4GE,"We really love this series.  Just wonderful characters, acted perfectly.  Great plots.  I can't recommend it highly enough for people who like police dramas.  (Husband is an officer.)",1269561600,,183,5.428571428571429
2248971,1,B0007XG4GE,"I purchased and watched Seasons 1 through 6 and thought that this might have been one of the best TV series ever - Season 7, however is a huge disappointment - the stories don't seem to flow, all of the individual detectives are in constant conflict with one another, and they have added a new twist - some brief scenes with inappropriate music - that lends an air of almost forced comedy as opposed to the serious nature that they are trying to show. I can highly recommend Seasons 1 through 6, but I cannot recommend Season 7. It was so bad I can see why the show was canceled after Season 7.",1247788800,6,594,4.265486725663717
2248972,5,B0007XG4GE,Homicide is a great series that was never given it's due by NBC executives. Watching the DVDs allow for a better continuity.,1240617600,,124,4.681818181818182
2248973,5,B0007XG4GE,"this last season of season seven was good for a season ending. It showed cop are human beings who at times make bad decisions like everyday people then learn from them, sometimes they don't. the show sheds light on the inner workings of being a peace officer I loved the acting by andre braugher who is supreme talent in my view of him. I can't forget the african king yaphet koto playing watch father over his children. the show is great.",1207526400,,439,4.432098765432099
2248974,4,B0007XG4GE,A great show but this is not the greatest season although my girlfriend appears in one episode so it's worth the price to me. Add it to your collection. You won't be disappointed.,1197244800,,179,4.454545454545454
2248975,5,B0007XG4GE,"I haven't watched these in a looong time, but loved the series.  All were great, though I'd say the very first show was too heavy and too sad for me.  While I also was sooo disappointed with Andre Braugher's departure (character Frank Pembleton), the series hung in there well and with kudos from me.  Michael Michele (or is it the other way) just great, and the other characters, Mike Giardello among them phenomenal.  While I agree to some extent with the reviewer that felt that Al G. and Mike G. did not have enough of a link as father and son, at the same time, I felt it believable, and thought each showed consistently very fine performances. Really liked Reed Diamond-Mike, missed him when he left.  As far as another's comment that the police station was re-decorated...this was after devastating/traumatic cop killings at the station.  I found this believable and needed.  While I know it was only TV, it felt like we really lost our own.  Also, Bayliss morphing from somewhat strange into somewhat stranger was powerful...and frighteningly real.

Can't say enough GREAT about this show...the building of characters is what made it soooo powerful and enduring.",1191110400,,1170,4.898477157360406
2248976,4,B0007XG4GE,This was the final season for this show. It was a gret series with lots of great actors.,1183420800,,88,3.9444444444444446
2248977,3,B0007XG4GE,"At the end of season six, Bayliss has taken a bullet for his partner Frank Pembleton, and the resulting trauma has caused Frank to resign from the force, although I am never completely satisfied with his reasonings. Also at the end of season six, while being drilled in ""the box"", Mike Kellerman is finally tripped up over the issue of drug dealer Luther Mahoney's shooting having been on the level - it wasn't. Giardello, not wanting Kellerman to go to jail and to have the other two detectives involved (Stivers and Lewis) see their careers ended, gives Mike a way out - resign from the force. He takes this option, and two fine Homicide castmembers have exited stage left.

For the first time, the squad room has been redecorated. I guess the network suits thought that the show's abysmal ratings were because of ambience versus the abysmal time slot (Friday 10pm) that the show was stuck in plus changes in scripting and casting that the network itself had insisted upon. At any rate, sporting soft pastels and potted plants, the squad room now resembles a travel agency more than a suitable home for the murder police.

While the network suits were prettying up the place, they decided to bring in Michael Michele as ex-beauty queen/detective Rene Sheppard, who proceeds to do as good a job of helping this show jump the shark as Ted McGinley could have ever hoped to do. Batting her eyes, and even losing her gun to a suspect at one point in the season, she goes around pouting about how nobody wants to work with her. A more solid addition to the cast is Giancarlo Esposito as Al Giardello's son, Mike, who is liason between the Baltimore PD and the FBI, for whom he works. Esposito is a good actor, but the age separation is just not there between Al and Mike, and neither is any semblance of a believable family connection. The two come across more as brothers with a wide age separation and years of estrangement between them than father and son.

Notable individual episodes include those that wrap up Mike Kellerman's story after his exile at the end of season six - the two-parter ""Kellerman P.I"". Kellerman, now a private investigator, becomes involved with his coworkers again as they clash over the investigation of the murder of an infant at a motel. Another interesting episode is ""The Twenty Percent Solution"", in which Clark Johnson is given an opportunity to direct. That episode involves a man naming the person who killed him on videotape, the problem is that there is no body and no crime scene. The final of the Law & Order cross-overs, ""Sideshow"", is the least enjoyable and preachiest of the bunch. It is basically a heavy-handed message about the abuse of power of independent prosecuters and a thinly disguised statement on what was going on with the President at the time (remember this was the 1998-1999 season) more than it was a homicide investigation. In ""Lines of Fire,"" a father is holding his son and stepdaughter hostage and will only speak to Mike Giardello. The scenes between the father and Mike Giardello have the tension and tight scripting that is reminiscent of previous and better seasons.

Tim Bayliss, the character featured in the very first episode of the series, is the one to bring everything to a close. Bayliss has converted to Buddhism following his brush with death in season six, and becomes ""The Zen Detective"". This ushers in some episodes that further his character development where he is forced to shoot the killer of a Buddhist monk in self defense in ""Zen and the Art of Murder"". The other storyline concerning him involve episodes on the Internet killer, who is released on a technicality but vows to Bayliss that he will kill again. These two storylines - the Internet killer being freed and Tim discovering that he can kill if he has to - collide in the excellent series finale ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses"". This sets everything up for the Homicide movie that airs in February 2000.

Season seven of this once great TV show is largely forgettable. Although Homicide had some excellent actors that worked well together, even during this final season, it could just not recover from losing the glue that held it all together - Frank Pembleton. He was the squad's best detective and the thinker of the group, famous for his Shakespearean musings. For better or worse, he was the star of this show, and when he left ""Homicide"" was living on borrowed time.

As an aside, if you are thinking about purchasing any season of ""Homicide"", you might want to purchase the ""Homicide Life on the Street - Complete Series Megaset"" that has all seven seasons, the Law and Order cross-over episodes, and the movie. I am just doing my review of season seven here because it affords me more room.",1159660800,3,4743,4.736077481840193
2248978,4,B0007XG4GE,"There aren't a lot of reviews here compared to other tv dvds.  I think the high price has affected sales.  It doesn't help that you can't see the show on tv now.  Law and Order gained viewers after cable started showing repeats and more people got interested in the show.  It must affect dvd sales.

Season 7 has it's weaknesses but it's hard to let go after seeing the other seasons.  As others have mentioned, Michael Michele is not very good, to put it mildly.  And if you've seen her in ER she also continues her wooden, stiff acting.  However the show's other actors do a great job as do the guest actors.  I suggest renting before you buy.",1148169600,3,645,4.352941176470588
2248979,5,B0007XG4GE,"I have to strongly, STRONGLY disagree with those who have said that Season 7, ""was a shadow of the show's former brilliance"", or that people ""will buy this set, if only to recall how far this show fell from greatness"", or that ""in terms of the series itself, it's a sad end to what is the greatest television show ever made"".

Because I got into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>&nbsp;very late into the series (around its 6th season),  I did not see the earlier seasons when they first aired on TV. However after Seasons 1-5 had been released on DVD, I checked them out from the library because I wanted to see what the earlier episodes were all about -- and after watching the first few episodes of the series I could barely force myself to sit there and watch the rest of the early seasons and I returned it to the library the very FIRST chance I got!

Although I now own those seasons on DVD since I bought the [ASIN:B002BLNGTS Homicide: Life on the Street Complete Series set]] in my book, Season 6 and 7 (as well as some episodes in Season 5) are the only ones worth watching, and I have literally never even touched any of the Season 1-4 DVD discs -- they have never been taken out of its case, even once!

Though I enjoyed some of the episodes in Season 5, I have to say, out of all the seasons of this show, Season 6 & 7 were my FAVORITES!

I could not stand the characters in the earlier seasons. Even though I liked Pembleton post-stroke, before it, I thought he was unbearably arrogant, bossy, cocky, and downright irritating. I didn't like Kay Howard, or Felton, or Bolander either. Bayliss was okay, but like Pembleton, I liked him much better later on. Russert was okay too. I would not have minded if she had stayed on for Seasons 6, and 7. I would have liked to seen how she got along with my fave characters like Ballard, Falsone, Sheppard and Stivers.

Although I HATE Gharty, and wish that he had not been added to the regular cast in Seasons 6 and 7, I LOVE Ballard, and Falsone, and think that they made an ADORABLE couple. I also think the addition in season 7 of Det. Rene Sheppard (Michael Michele) was a great infusion of an aggressive yet sometimes vulnerable female character, and the character of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), was a nice addition to show the kind of alliances that occur in real life between federal and local police agencies.

2248981,3,B0007XG4GE,"There is nothing worse for a diehard fan of a truly great television series than to see their favorite work spiral from top quality to bottom-of-the-barrel. Many reviewers have already said it and it is very true; Homicide's final season was, by far, its weakest. The most obvious reason was, of course, due to the departure of Emmy winner Andre Braugher as the moralistic and intense centerpiece of the show, Frank Pembleton, but one also can't overlook the damage done by Reed Diamond's exit as the turbulent Mike Kellerman. The absence of these two genuine characters, succeeding the departures of other greats like Kay Howard, Stan Bolander, Juliana Cox, Beau Felton and Megan Russert, was just too much for the series to take.

But its not only the lack of decent characters that hurt the show; bad writing and gimmicky plots further drove Homicide downward. There is no better evidence of this than the introduction of Lt. Al Giardello's son Mike (Giancarlo Esposito) as an FBI liaison to the Baltimore police department. The conflict between father and son is supposed to be compelling, but the two actors and characters are so different and share so little chemistry that its impossible to regard their ongoing struggle to reconnect as little more than a bad soap opera subplot, not worthy of Homicide's past creative achievements. The other new face is Det. Renee Sheppard (Michael Michele.) She is little more than just a new face. She has no personality and adds nothing to the group dynamic of the show. Other players from the previous year (Gharty, Falsone and Ballard) take center stage in this season. They were tolerable before, but their personal relationships and watery portrayals only show why a good ensemble drama needs good actors and authentic characters to be successful. There's a third and final crossover with Law & Order, but it tries to press too many political buttons in the midst of the Lewinsky/Starr scandal and comes off as too heavy-handed and manipulative for its own good.

Despite the final season's many obvious flaws, there's just enough to bring diehard fans like me back for the finish. The two-part ""Kellerman, P.I."" gives us some closure to Mike Kellerman's character that we won't find in the subsequent movie. Several other noteworthy episodes include ""Lines of Fire,"" ""The Same Coin,"" ""Homicide.com,"" ""Self-defense,"" and ""Truth Will Out."" Old Homicide veterans like Munch, Lewis and Giardello Sr. still put in quality performances, though they aren't as effective when they're not given good stories and actors off which to play. Tim Bayliss is one of the few compelling characters that remains, though he is a mixed bag for much of the season. After returning from his near-fatal shooting in the sixth season finale, he seems to be adrift without Pembleton and clings to Buddhism for comfort. This comes off as clich&eacute; and cornie for much of the season, but his strange trip is worth the pay-off in the excellent series finale, ""Forgive Us Our Trespasses,"" when Bayliss ends his series arc in a dark and disturbing fashion. Viewers left hanging can find some answers in the Homicide movie, though it too suffers from its own problems.

The extras are sparse in this set, though not necessarily as bare as previous offerings. The panel interview is insightful and the commentary is pretty good. This DVD set may not be worth 100 bucks, but its really necessary to complete the collection of an otherwise excellent and vastly under-rated network series. If the price tag puts you off, just do what I did and buy it used. Enjoy the great series finale and the few other gems in this season and thank David Simon, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson for bringing us this truly outstanding television program.",1122768000,33,3755,4.966613672496026
2248982,3,B0007XG4GE,"First of all, your name leads me to believe that your whole review is a joke, as I don't think that is a name that anyone would self-apply, unless they were trying to get a rise out of people.  So I'm just going to believe that your whole review is there to achieve that same effect.  I just can't believe that anyone could be that into weak characters such as Falsone, Ballard, Gharty, and (he shudders as he types) Rene Sheppard, call themself ""Ben Bratt lover"" and have been attracted to a show like Homicide:  LOTS in the first place.  You just laid it on a little too thick pal, but I give ya credit, it did give me a few good laughs.  Anyways, this was by far the weakest season of Homicide:  LOTS and while it still had its moments, it nowhere equalled the levels of excellence achieved by the previous seasons.  The losses of Pembleton and Kellerman not withstanding, the show just had a different look and feel that year, and if this was the route NBC had forced them to take, it was better to end it when they did.  I don't know what NBC was thinking, but a character like Renee Sheppard had no business on Homicide:  LOTS...  Ok, maybe she did.  She would've made one nice lookin' corpse.",1122336000,3,1199,4.331838565022421
2248983,5,B0007XG4GE,"I've been reading all the hoopla of how much worse Season 7 is from the rest and bought into it because of the absence of Andre Braugher, et al and continuing saga of Jon Seda, et al.  I had been an avid Homicide viewer from Seasons 3-5 when it was on, network television, but because of a work schedule and a broken VCR I missed most of the 6th Season and all 7th Season.

I've just finished watching Season 7 off of the DVDs I purchased (bought all the others already), and all I can say is that the naysayers are wrong.  Sure, the romances get a little out of hand, but other than that I really have only viewed 1 or 2 weak shows in the whole season.  The same can be said for most of the other seasons as well.  The two part episode, Kellerman, P.I., with Reed Diamond and Jena Malone is outstanding as is Lines of Fire, Homicide.com, Bones of Contention, etc.  Personally, I found La Famiglia the weakest of the lot. After viewing it, I thought, ""geez, they're right.  this season is weak.""

Don't believe it.  The writing is still top notch.  The addition of Austin Pendleton is a real plus.  I would have liked to have seen more of Clark Johnson, but he still plays a prominent role in most of the episodes and thank God he's still carrying on the tradition with his directing from all that he learned on this show.  I also have grown to like Jon Seda and his character.  It was difficult at first, but his honest portrayal of an honest man in the midst of chaos retains is commendable.

I'm sad that I'm finally at the end after having bought all of the seasons as they're release, but so happy that I have them to watch over and over.  Homicide: Life on the Street - all seven seasons, is the best investment I've made in a long time.

4 Stars for some of the excessive romance.  That's NBC's fault.

5 Stars for the Season as a whole.",1121990400,9,1844,4.234957020057307

I don't care what novice reviewer has to type, I checked my old VHS tapes for Homicide episodes and the picture was 100% clearer then what is released on DVD.

Sure some douche will spring up, ""the picture was made to be grainy"" , no kidding Holmes, but to compare what was released on TV and from a VHS source to the UPDATED DVD format, there is no contest.

NBC and A&E have done a piss poor job at releasing the series onto DVD.

First off last season which was arguably the best of the shows run, was a waste of money.

SEASON 6 included two, TWO-HOUR double episodes.

The first SOMETHING SACRED dealing with the murder of priests, which was originally shown in a two hour block, but was split for DVD. Ok...that one was on the house.

The most painful of the two was FALLEN HEROES. What was originally released in two parts, was re released at the beginning of Season 7 in a two hour movie which included some really awesome footage put back in. Including a scene introducing Gharty's wife and which also included more violence which added to the horror of the what was happening.

But what were we given for $99 bucks, (at Best Buy) the best of the series SPLIT in two without the inclusion of those scenes.

I mean in each box set, which aren't that cheap mind you, we're treated to a boring behind the scenes and some thrown together commentary...which doesn't even include cast members.

I think season 5 had Clark Johnson but he was commenting more from a directors stand point.

And finally a dumb thrown together ""MUSIC from the show"" menu. Which anyone who is a fan or admirer of the show has already gotten from someones else's WEBSITE while the show was still on the AIR!

Oh and NO DELETED SCENES? My ass.

I mean we're not even treated to a GREAT PICTURE let alone a truly surround sound experience.

I mean...was that too much to ask? Were the other cast members too busy right now to join up for 45 minutes to talk about the show?

I mean where is all that footage from the Homicide conventions that happened?

I mean this is one of the greatest if not the GREATEST police shows ever to be produced and yet they don't care enough to produce a great DVD.

Oh but CHARLES IN CHARGE SEASON 1 gets the works.

I mean compared to THE SHIELD, Homicide looks like blues clues, but is still amazing to watch and to see how the show progressed, even then was ahead of it's time. Homicide was one of the first to include music as a drive for scenes which many have copied newer example being COLD CASE.

So now here we are with Season 7 DVD box set.

Of course I will waste my hard earned dough for the set, only because this is the only way to get them. But is it really worth the price tag? NO.

Better luck finding complete episodes on VHS and copy your own to DVD.

And you can truly say you've put more time and energy into it than A&E or NBC has.

Sorry for those of you who find this negative, but after Season 6 being cut short, never to have those full length shows again...I feel cheated and used.

I mean I even had to make my own SOUNDTRACK because there never was one released.

Oh but if you want, rush out and pick of the JOAN OF ARCADIA soundtrack...gimme a break.

Hope this was helpful.

2248985,3,B0007XG4GE,"While I normally don't deride others comments on these boards, I have to thoroughly disagree with the earlier writer who said that seasons six and seven were the only ones worth watching.  NBC made an attempt to make the show more accessible to fans of shows such as NYPD Blue and Law and Order, it doesn't hold a candle to the earlier seasons.  However, everyone is entitled to an opinion and here is mine.

While season six had a decent mix of the long standing characters (Pembleton, Bayliss, Munch, Louis) combined with Kellerman (who in my opinion was harder to replace than Pembleton in some ways) and bits of the new characters, season seven relies almost entirely on the ""new and improved"" NBC version of Homicide.

That means more Falsone, more Ballard, more Gharty combined with Sheppard.  While Ballard and Gharty aren't bad characters, Falsone is pretty hard to swallow and Sheppard doesn't ever fit the show's image.  It seems as if each character is attempting to replay a former character.  Falsone resembles a less sympathetic Felton, Ballard is attempting to play a ""sexy"" Howard, and Gharty a more blue collar Bolander.  None is as good as the original.  Also, the long standing partnerships of characters drove the show in many ways (Pembleton/Bayliss, Bolander/Munch).  It was almost a novelty to see the original cast team up with someone else such as when Louis was searching for partner to bridge the time between Crosetti and Kellerman.  Now they sort of freelance with various partners, killing some of the strength of the dialogue of earlier seasons.

The reason to watch this season is the writing as well as the catharsis experienced by the Bayliss character.  More than any other character, the character of Tim Bayliss is intrinsically connected to all the various incarnations of the show.  Plus, the worst season of this show is still ""very good"" and the new characters are less bad characters as they are in the difficult position of following one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled during the first five years of the show's run.",1116979200,16,2073,4.902578796561604
8053574,5,B0007XG4GE,"I'm surprised to read others' review of this season.  I thought it was at least as good as the previous 6 seasons.
The whole show was up there with ""The Sopranos"", ""Breaking Bad"", ""The Wire"", ""The Killing"", etc.  When I finished binge watching it I had a lot of difficulty leaving Baltimore.  Kind of wish I'd seen it before I watched ""The Wire"", but at least I now have David Simon's book to ease my transition back home.
Great story lines. Almost all the actors started out great and got better, especially Andre Brauer, Richard Belzer, and Clark Johnson, and others like Kyle Secor, John Seda, and Michael Michelle  matured and were developed more fully in each episode.  I found it a refreshing change from ""Criminal Minds', etc. Clueless why it got such bad ratings back in the day.

8053581,4,B0007XG4GE,"The Seventh and last season of HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET is usually derided as the nadir.  I do not concur.  The loss of Andre Braugher and Reed Diamond gave the series a chance to expand on their other characters, and, several times, rose to the occasion.  As with every season, the series has its high points and low points, but over all, the writing saves almost every storyline.  The series was, indeed, showing signs of wear, and the new coat of paint to the station house didn't help.  It moved the series even further from its funky, slice-of-reality roots to a slicker look (note the quick whip through the three-season-old, NBC-demanded revamping of the title sequence:  everyone wanted to ape SE7EN's typeface).  At this point, Only The Belz, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto and Kyle Secor remained from the start of the series, and each actor's character was given some more screen time.  Diamond came back for an effective two-parter which brought the story of Kellerman to a satisfying conclusion.  Stories of girl gangbangers, the death of a monk and guest star Chris Meloni as a hunter of fugitives (did this get him the job on SVU?) were all highlights of this season.  Secor's Tim Bayliss spends most of the season in a state of flux, his friend and partner Frank Pembleton gone, leaving Tim rudderless in the sea of death.  By the end of the season and the series, Bayliss is shown as having grown from a wide-eyed youth to a man who has had more than a healthy dose of reality.  He has become a very good Murder Police, but the toll it has taken. . .  And the series ends, as it began, with Bayliss, our eyes and ears into the heart of the Homicide beast.  It is an appropriate ending, a full circle.  The TV-movie that followed was unnecessary:  the last episode was just right, and reminds me of the last episode of THE SHIELD.  It couldn't end any other way.  Raise a glass of beer in the Waterfront to the cast, crew, producers and especially the writers of HOMICIDE.  Ya done good.",1410134400,,2004,4.563025210084033
