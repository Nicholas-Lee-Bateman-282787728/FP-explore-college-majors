2999508,5,B000X9NPQE,"After two months of rollersetting my own hair and not achieving the sleek smooth look, I decided to purchase this DVD. I just finished doing a rollerset and it came out absolutely perfect. My hair is textlaxed, and I was starting to think that this was the reason my rollersets were so frizzy and dry-looking. Not the case at all... I'm glad I purchased this before I went bone straight. Thank you Macherieamour... your techniques really work.... I can finally be flat iron free!!",1218758400,,480,4.726190476190476
2999509,5,B000X9NPQE,I loved this video! It was perfect for me. I've been going to the salon each week for rollersets but this video has taught me how to accomplish beautiful bouncy curls on my own without going to the salon. The step by step instructions are perfect and she provides great hints and tips for achieving a great flat ironed look with saran wrap - very cool. I'm extremely pleased with this instructional DVD!,1216944000,2,403,4.534246575342466
2999510,5,B000X9NPQE,"I am a memeber of her website, healthy textures. I joined yesterday and I have been up 24hrs with no sleep so into this site and her information. I an a hair fanatic and I would like to say I am a guru but there is always room to learn from others. I am constantly reading & keep up with the latest of healthy hair care regimens and this girl knows her stuff. I haven't found anything yet to be inaccurate & we kind of have the same kind of hair except hers is twice as long as mine so she is definitely my inspiration. For those of you that don't think she 100% African American, she is & that is her hair!!! I know because I have a twin & her hair grew like this nonstop & we are definitely African American. She basically did the same things that Macherie (the girl in the video) did. I was into hair but I didn't try as hard then so now I'm at that point and I'm going where those girls are-- for the buttock line, lol!!! She is a gorgous girl and she is real so if you are into hair this is the realest info out there, [...]. Also if you have trouble with the video playing call and talk to the amazon UNBOX tech & they can fix it in 10sec, not the regular customer service. They send you a link to your email to allow your computer to play the software otherwise you will keep getting the ""hour-glass"" like I did for 4 hrs then someone helped me in 10sec, the video was worth it though. I pretty much knew how to do a roller set but I wanted to see if I could learn anything from her. I did learn to use two clamps instead of one and it reinforced the information I already knew. Great BUY!!!",1214524800,4,1598,3.9813084112149535
2999511,5,B000X9NPQE,"This video is EXCELLENT!  I learned tons about rollersetting.  However, I had to delete the video (along with the Amazon unbox player) before I finished viewing it because my brand new computer with plenty of disk space acted screwy once I downloaded it.  The video is also available on DVD...I'd recommend purchasing it that way to save yourself some technological headaches.",1208044800,3,376,5.131147540983607

She takes you through the full process including washing, conditioning, proper tools, products for the type of roller set you are trying to achieve and of course the roller setting technique. The Mohawk Roller setting method and silk wrap technique are a great addition. I definitely can't wait until the Self-Relaxing DVD is released. The DVD and the many more to come will allow women to stop depending on stylist to preserve and style your hair.

8227373,5,B000X9NPQE,"I have been doing my own rollersets for about 18 months now, ranging from ok to horrible. I had heard about this video before and didn't buy it...until something told me to go ahead and do so. Boy!!!! Am I glad that I did!! This video transformed my last rollerset.

8227378,5,B000X9NPQE,"The Healthy Textures Guide to Roller Setting DVD was extremely helpful in teaching me how to roll my own hair. This technique is great if you want to wear your hair straight or curly without using too much direct heat. I was surprised that I was able to master the technique the first time.

I've tweaked her technique a bit to suit my own style. The main thing that this video helped me with was learning how to use ""tension,"" to get smooth, shiny curls. I would definitely suggest it to anyone interested in doing her own hair. It was worth the $17.50 that I paid for the DVD because, in the long term, it saved me a lot of money.

You can read my full review & pictures of my hair the FIRST time that i used this technique here:[...]",1247270400,2,736,4.212765957446808

Gennifer takes you through the process of shampooing, conditioning and setting your relaxed hair with easy, logical explanations of each step.  She discusses the types of rollers and clips to use - and those make such a difference!  I always thought I'd never be able to do this but now I can, and I can do it quickly too!",1227398400,5,438,4.178571428571429

I don't want to give anything away, but the techniques and information have really helped improve my rollersets.  I have a lot of hair, with several different textures, so my challange now is to get my rollersetting time to 30 mins max.  I'm sure it will happen with some practice :)",1220832000,2,426,4.379746835443038
8227381,4,B000X9NPQE,"A must have for any woman with relaxed hair who wants to maintain healthy hair. I do rollersets every weekend now, and it's helping me grow my hair more healthier and stronger. The only thing I wished she was more specific about when doing the film is how to blowdry your roots, because I'm still have trouble with that. Other than that, this DVD is a keeper.

Note: Don't expect a blockbuster (ie, special effects, a soundtrack, etc.) when you buy his film--it's strictly informative. Just fyi. :)",1220313600,3,498,4.659090909090909
