8528626,5,B008KC3SQ8,"It's no secret that it was when C.M. Punk decided to speak his mind only to win the WWE Championship weeks later the night his contract expired that he ""broke the glass"" ceiling & became one of the most popular stars in current day WWE.  However this isn't the first time this type of incident has happened in Punk's career as it was back in 2005 before he came to WWE, C.M. Punk made it clear that he was leaving Ring Of Honor wrestling but won the ROH Championship on what would be his last night in the company to a hero's reaction...only for him to completely drop a ""pipe bomb"" in that he was leaving ROH & taking the title hostage with him.  That kicked off what would be remembered as ""The Summer Of Punk"" where many challengers would attempt to take the championship in a ""must win"" situation from Punk as he kept teasing how each match would be his last in the company.  This DVD set showcases all of his matches in during this period along with his various promos including his confrontations with Mick Foley and when he signed his WWE contract on top of the ROH Championship.

vs. ROH Champion Austin Aries - This was setup to be Punk's final match in ROH going for the World Championship that he's never held.  Aries came into this match with a bad neck & Punk targeted it heavily with forearms, nerve holds, spinning neckbreaker & a tight gripped headlock to the point where he pulled Aries over the top rope from the apron down to the ground with a headlock. Aries made attempts to mat wrestle Punk himself while also working on his neck with a Death Valley Driver on the apron & suplex that landed Punk right on his neck before throwing Punk into the corner so many times that the turnbuckle padding came off.  Both men traded momentum going went aerial with Punk's flying clothesline & crossbody while Aries did a super brainbuster off the top rope & 450 splash as both men were able to counter & kickout of the others signature moves time & time again getting closer to a victory each time.  This was a highly competitive match (as expected) but this match is more infamous for what happened afterwords when Punk dropped his first ""pipe bomb.""
""Death Before Dishonor III"" June 18

vs. Jay Lethal - Punk requested a match with Lethal here to avenge a previous loss to him in a tag match.  Lethal came out with a bang as the first move was the dragon suplex that he used to beat Punk previously before taking the fight to the outside beating on Punk before delivering various back suplexes in the ring.  Punk attempted to ground Lethal going after the neck with a neckbreaker, various headlocks & forearms which was effective as Lethal went for a diving headbutt later in the match but showed that he only ended up hurting his neck more.  Samoa Joe was at ringside showing support for Lethal with him & Punk having a long history too as both men went back & forth here but it was Punk who not only avenged his loss but also did it in a way that sent a message directly to Joe.
""Sign Of Dishonor"" July 8

vs. Roderick Strong - Both men went back & forth early before Strong was able to get the best of Punk with his chops to where Punk was bleeding from the chest & at one point was chopped over the railing into the crowd.  Punk was able regain control but started getting more arrogant as he continued to taunt Samoa Joe & James Gibson who were in the stands while working over Strong with a chinlock while Strong worked over Punk's back with back to back backbreakers followed by a back suplex.  This was a good showcasing of Punk as a heel along with a showcase for a young Roderick Strong.
""Escape From New York"" July 9

vs. James Gibson - Punk attacked Gibson earlier in the night busting his head open causing Gibson to come into this match with his head bandaged up but that only enraged Gibson to the point where he came at Punk with a suicide dive to Punk right away that almost sent both men over the guardrail causing Punk's back to bleed.  Punk focused on Gibson's head with by ramming it into the turnbuckle & punches with later delivering a stiff kick to the head before a miscalculation on his part opened the door for Gibson to work over Punk's shoulder with armbars, a hammerlock suplex & later a DDT on the apron.  Both men turned it up beating each other into exhaustion with each man kicking out of each others signature moves & going for various submissions like the Guillotine Choke, Dragon Sleeper, and Anaconda Vice.  If you only know James Gibson through his WCW days as a Jung Dragon or his WWE run, you'll be more than impressed here with his performance here but stay tuned after this match for the events that happened which setup...
""Fate Of An Angel II"" July 16

vs. Christopher Daniels - ...this match as both men traded back & forth early with both men being very technical as each tried to gain control exchanging chops & forearms.  Daniels focused on Punk's neck twisting it & beating on it with forearms & ramming it into the guardrail constantly while also delivering various holds like a belly to back suplex, crossface, and grinding on it with a headlock. Punk came back attacking Daniels midsection with a body scissors, abdominal stretch, and even a neckbreaker on Daniels with him tied up in the ropes.  Both men continued to trade momentum as Daniels did his own abdominal stretch that locked Punk's neck, Punk blocked the B.M.E. that sent Daniels over the top to the floor causing Daniels to hit the apron midsection first on the way down & Daniels later delivering the B.M.E. but hurt his own midsection in the process.  Both men went the distance here in a type of match that left people wanting more.
""The Homecoming"" July 23

vs. Christopher Daniels vs. James Gibson vs. Samoa Joe - Punk had crossed paths with all three of these men in some way since he won the ROH Championship to the point where all three were arguing over who gets the first shot at him before the match.  Punk was trying to avoid Joe at all cost leading to him wrestling Gibson & Daniels only for Joe to eventually get the tag in with Gibson & Daniels dropping to the floor so Punk couldn't tag out.  Joe was dominate against not only Punk but Gibson & Daniels as well before the series of tagging in & out lead to the first time Gibson & Daniels faced each other one on one with Punk eventually tagging himself in & attacking both men causing them to team together to double team Punk.  Punk continued to taunt Joe the whole match but also continued to be the odd man out by his opponents still refusing to tag him out causing him to take desperate actions by attacking Gibson with a chair to the point where he was taken to the back & out of the match while performing moves that we hadn't seen from him in recent times like the split legged & regular moonsaults before karma & his actions earlier with Gibson would come back to haunt him & finally catch up to him.
""Redemption"" Aug. 12

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match vs. Colt Cabana - For those who don't already know, Punk & Cabana have a lot of history together as they were former Tag Team Champions, both trained by the same man (who also happened to be at ringside for this match), and both from Chicago.  With this definitely being Punk's final match in ROH, he had a hero's welcome from his hometown crowd as both men traded momentum early & were evenly matched before Punk started to get annoyed by Colt's comedy causing him to not only use dirty tactics but also stole his own signature move.  Cabana got more aggressive as a result with moves like the lariat leading to both men turning turning it up as they exchanged loud chops to the point where the sweat was flying off their bodies with each chop before both men went aerial with Punk with a frankensteiner & Cabana with a moonsault off the apron to the floor with Cabana later doing both a scorpion deathdrop & a samoan drop from the top rope.  This was a good match but was heavily overshadowed in the end by the emotional farewell speech by Punk & celebration given by the entire ROH roster & staff.
""Punk: The Final Chapter"" Aug. 15

This was a great chronicle from what I consider to be one of the best storylines I've seen in wrestling history as all the matches were top quality & the promo work was top notch with ROH taking a chance on some of the antics they did to get this storyline over (you would never see a top company like WWE or TNA allow one of their talents to sign the other company's contract on top of their World Championship).  I shouldn't have to recommend this to hardcore Punk/ROH fans but those who hasn't seen C.M. Punk before his WWE days or was drawn into his storyline regarding the WWE championship then this is definitely a DVD to go out of your way to get.",1344816000,,8738,4.3946716232961585
