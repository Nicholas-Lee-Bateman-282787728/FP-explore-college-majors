7967637,5,B00006F7JP,"I'm a big fan of Bryan Kest. He has a way of creating programs that are challenging physically without losing the essence of yoga.
 He always emphasizes breathing, focus and respecting one's limitations. He also stresses the idea of using your yoga practice to work on maintaining equanimity during your practice. The idea being that if you can practice having equanimity in the face of these physical challenges that it can translate into your real life as you deal with the day to day challenges of being a human being.
 In terms of the physical part of the practice, this 6 minute Abs program is a really great way to be able to target your abdominals in a way that utilizes your whole body. It uses an interesting variety of poses which definitely move your abs through various ranges of motion.
 This program is actually made up of two separate routines which are about 15 minutes each, with probably about 6 minutes of it being strictly focused on the abdominals. Of course most Yoga poses utilize your whole body by being very synergistic so your abs are actually almost always engaged.
 Each of the two routines start with one Sun Salutation A and one B, then moves into a Series that is works the abdominals more specifically. One example of a yoga pose that he turns into an excellent abdominal pose is balancing table with one arm extended to one side while your opposite leg extends out to the other side.
 Both routines have some vinyasa interspersed between the abdominal poses and end's with a supine twist and relaxation.
 Either of these routines are excellent by themselves but can also be combined with another short routine. For example, you may follow or precede it with one of the Yoga Zone tapes (that have 2-20 minute routines per tape), something like Stress Relief Yoga by Suzanne Deason or any of the Power Yoga for Beginners programs by Rodney Yee or anything else you like.
 I would have to agree with another reviewer who said that the title of the video might accidentally make people think that this program might be mistaken as literally a 6 minute workout and might hesitate to purchase it. That is a shame because this program is definitely much more than the title indicates.
 As a person who has been doing yoga every day for about 8 years, has a substantial yoga video/dvd library and studies with an excellent teacher, I feel pretty comfortable recommending this program to anyone who is looking to have an excellent power yoga program with emphasis on the abdominals.

7967638,5,B00006F7JP,"This is a very short tape, made up of two body-core centered workouts, one of which is a little harder than the other.  Unlike some abs tapes, this tape does not so much isolate your abs as work them hard as part of your body core.  You will really develop abdominal power and flexibility, as well as the Yoga glow that comes from deep breathing and a calm mind.  You may not ""feel the burn"" the same way you would from crunches, but your abs and back will definitely thank you for these great strengthening and body-integrating movements.  A good complement to the other Power tapes, Intensive Body Sculpting and the Weight Loss tape.",1062633600,6,635,4.543859649122807
7967639,4,B00006F7JP,"I liked this video for targeting right where it says, the abs.  Moreover, it doesn't sacrifice any of the yoga, at least the way Bryan teaches, because I found myself still focusing on my breath with every movement.  I like using this video on those days when I want to focus on my abs.",1034294400,2,286,4.277777777777778
7967640,4,B00006F7JP,"While this may work for some people, it doesn't work well for me. It's presented well and the asanas should work. I will admit that because of a bad lower back I couldn't do all the asanas as I should. So it probably would work well for others. I am going to try it with some back support and see if I can do it more effectively. I found that I got much more of an ab workout that I felt later the same day with Baron Baptist's new video, Journey into Power - Level 2. And it isn't even a core video. Also, I don't like Baptiste as well as Kest simply because Kest has a better flow from Downward Dog to Cobra and then the transition pushup, which Baptiste fails to use. I guess that's a minor point, however.
This video will probably be great for someone who has a reasonably  strong lower back. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone who does not. I'm going to try it again and if I still have problems, I plan to sell the video.
There are two workouts on the video. The second one is supposed to be more challenging. I've not tried it yet.
Bryan has gone more mainstream now and is not as appealing and his videos lack what they had in 1995. But I think that because he's older, this is a natural evolution and there's certainly nothing wrong with it. He's still a wonderful instructor.
Baron Baptiste does, however, name the asanas and gives you a bit more help in his videos. But I think a video that may be good to one person may not to another.",1033430400,3,1456,4.126760563380282
