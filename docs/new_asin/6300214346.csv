239910,4,6300214346,"The Keep is an 80's cult film and like most cult classics, it has its flaws yet there are many things to like about it too.  Turn off the critical mind and watch it as a dark, surreal bad dream.  Directed by Michael Mann, with a cast of fine actors at the start of their careers (Scott Glenn, Jurgen Prochnow, Gabriel Byrne, Alberta Watson, Robert Prosky, Ian McKellen) and a score by electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream.  The soundtrack alone makes it worth watching.  The real shame is Paramount Pictures cut it down from 210 minutes to 96 minutes, which introduced the plot holes and choppiness.  After all of these years, it would be great to get a Director's Cut from Michael Mann.",1519430400,,692,4.59349593495935

I would give the film itself 4 stars.
I subtract 1 star for the lack of widescreen.
I have watched it now and it was obviously burned from an old VHS copy. There is noticeable Distortion at the top and bottom of the screen. I will stay with the three star review.

240061,3,6300214346,"I am not going to comment so much on the film itself so much as it's treatment on DVD.  Many others have already commented about the film's plot, cinematography, adherence to the book, etc.  If you're like me you saw the movie back in the 1980's and wanted to rewatch it, but a DVD copy hadn't been available until just recently.  That's where I'm going to focus.

First, it is a DVD, and not a Blu Ray so if you're used to crystal-clear video you'll be in for a shock.  On my Blu Ray player the picture was sized down instead of filling the screen.  This also happened on a DVD copy of Romancing the Stone, so it's a quirk with my Samsung player.  Not all DVD movies do that, but this one did.  I also have a Toshiba DVD VCR combo.  Playing it on that I had no black bars and it filled the viewing area.  I'm not certain what the original aspect ratio was filmed in.  There appears to be some distortion.

As for the quality of the picture, it's not great.  It looks like it was transferred from a VHS tape onto a DVD as opposed to having come from a master.  There's even one spot where it looks like the tape skipped.  The text in the credits is almost unreadable, even on a 60+ inch screen.  The film definitely needs a remaster and re-release.  Watched in a dark room I had no trouble distinguishing any details, and I did not have to adjust my screen for brightness.

Some people have complained about the sound.  I found no difficulty understanding any dialogue, making out the various sound effects, and I had no trouble telling what was going on.  I did not find the music to overpower dialogue at any point.  I do tend to watch movies with high-quality headphones though, so your mileage may vary depending on your sound system.

Extras:  There are none.  You get a movie in a case.  You put the disk in and watch the movie.  That's it.

It's a shame a better quality copy of this film is not available.  It would be nice to see a remaster of the film down the road, especially since the original recording was cut down from about 3 hours to its current length before being released in 1983.  I would love to see a director's cut or at least a remaster with additional and/or deleted scenes, but I wouldn't hope for it any time soon.

Bottom line:  If you enjoyed The Keep the first time around this will have to do for now.",1512864000,5,2334,4.260273972602739

240206,5,6300214346,"Since no official description is listed here, the DVD insert reads;

This superb gothic thriller will grip you with its combination of horror, romance and the supernatural. It is World War II in German occupied Rumania. Nazi soldiers have been sent to garrison a mysterious fortress, but a nightmarish discovery is soon made. THE KEEP was not built to keep something in 

(Note: Thats right, somebody misprinted the description as we all know that this place was not built to keep anything out. This place was built to keep something  in!)

Scott Glenn portrays the stranger who alone must battle the supernatural force whose evil power is dwelling within. Ian McKellen is the medieval historian, Cuza, dragged to THE KEEP to unravel the mystery behind its gruesome killings. Alberta Watson stars as Cuzas devoted daughter, Eva, who falls in love with the handsome, heroic stranger.

1983 / 96 MIN / Colour / NTSC / 4.3 / ALL (Region) / MA 15+ / Not suitable for people under 15. Under 15s must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian
------------
As stated, THE KEEP drifted into theaters in December of 1983. If you weren't already there watching Return of the Jedi for the 26th time, you may have been chilling out to something more relaxing like Scarface or Steven Kings Christine, or maybe, even something truly gruesome, like  Terms of Endearment.

 That year a pack of cigarettes, an average comic book, and a loaf of bread all cost in the neighborhood of 60 cents. A gallon of milk cost $1.89, while a gallon of gas was $1.25. The average salary was $15 grand, and your median house cost north of $80 grand.

 President Ronald Wilson Reagan (666) was finishing his first term in the Whitehouse, QB Aaron Rogers & comic actor Jonah Hill were born, and French bombshell Fifi DOrsay, actor Slim Pickens, director Robert Aldrich, and Beach Boy singer Dennis Wilson all passed on.

 The Steelers defeated the Jets (347) in the last NFL game played at Shea Stadium. The highest scoring regular season NBA game (3OT) took place between the Pistons & Nuggets (184184) where 4 players dropped over 40 points, with gamehigh (51) going to Kiki Vandeweghe.

 The Great Video Game Crash of 1983 was nearly upon us, but in the meantime, we passed the time playing Mario Bros., Dragons Lair, Space ace, or Spy Hunter. Michael Jacksons Thriller video had its MTV debut, as Michael teamed up with Paul McCartney on Say Say Say, while Lionel Ritchie rocked All Night Long.

Now if you remember experiencing any of these events, then youll probably be familiar with an extremely prolific German band named Tangerine Dream. Not really known for any one single Top 10 hit, they were early pioneers of electronic music, and later, produced many atmospheric movie soundtracks like THE KEEP **.

(Note: Dont know why I keep writing the title in all CAPS, it just seems appropriate for this review.)

This film had a talented cast, with Scott Glenn (Netflix Daredevil & Defenders), Alberta Watson (The Border), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot & Beerfest), Robert Prosky (The Practice), Gabriel Byrne (Vikings), Ian McKellen (LOTR & Hobbit), W. Morgan Sheppard (Star Trek), Michael Carter (ROTJ), and Wolf Kahler (THE KEEP).

Directed by Michael Mann, a man so scarred by the awful critical response, he fled to TV and avenged himself upon the world with Miami Vice. Followed by The Kingdom, Hancock, Texas Killing Fields, and Blackhat. Most viewers misunderstand this horror movie. I myself don't quite understand why I keep enjoying it. File it under a distinct case of guilty pleasures.

** If you dig this sound(track), you may want to unearth a copy of the 1986 fantasy flick Legend _ YES, its the one with Tom Cruise _ if only to see Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Picture Show) crush it while buried under a mountain of red rubber (Darkness). And while you're at it, Tangerine Dream also scored a nifty vampire flick entitled Near Dark (1987). It gives a whole new meaning to the saying the south will rise again.

240317,4,6300214346,"This is one of those movies that I used to watch, over and over and over.  I read about this movie so much and didn't understand all the controversy about it.  I understood the movie perfectly.  But, all these people stated that it was choppy, they didn't like the pacing, the director hated it because the studio took it from 3 hours to 1.5 hours, the ending was not was intended because the person in charge of developing that died and no one knew how to decipher his notes.  And finally this was a book and the author trashed the movie.  Well, I showed this movie to my son now that he is older and he said he didn't get it.  He's 17.  Heck I used to watch this movie when I was even younger and understood it enough to know it was a good story.

Watching it recently, I was interested in reading the book.  And so I saw it on Amazon Reads so I thought I'd read it.  It's good thus far, and actually the movie does follow the story.  But, other things I read about the book is that the monster in the book is different than what was depicted in the movie.  I don't want to spoil either the book or the movie, but I will say, for me, I much like the movie version of the villain instead.  But, that's personal opinion.  I don't like writing reviews for movies because people get all upset and start commenting back.  But, for this one, I decided to review.

Now, there is talk among the Internet that they are considering a remake of this movie.  And if they do, that would be absolutely fantastic!!!  With today's graphics, film making and sound it would be so worth it.  I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because it was an unfinished piece and the end for me wasn't all that great.  But, you should view it for yourself.

Also, the sound quality of one of the scenes was as if there was a problem with the mixing board and there was some static in the track.  Why they couldn't clean this up, I cant imagine why.  Also the little screen subtitles at the bottom were tiny and in red and you really couldn't read them.",1505520000,,2023,4.183937823834197

240321,2,6300214346,"I remember this as a VHS tape rental in the 80's.  It seemed okay at the time but clearly, it has not aged well.  The main problem begins and ends with the writing, or at least what made it on to screen.  There seems to be very little character development, despite having an outstanding cast that could have done a lot with this.  I suspect they shot some scenes that were cut for some reason and what remains is very thin.  The Tangerine Dream soundtrack was, let's face it, dated 18 months after they recorded it.  The special effects, well, they had Ghostbusters era effects to work with and they just went with too much of the least effective elements.  If you watch John Carpenter's The Thing, you'll get a much better 80's horror effect movie.  As for Michael Mann, I'd suggest his much more effective and creepy MANHUNTER, which was the first adaptation of the Hannibal Lecktor material that famously emerges later in Silence of the Lambs.  I wanted to give this three stars but I think it aged out and can only carry two now.",1504656000,,1034,4.4866310160427805

A cast of Scott Glenn (Sir) Ian McKellen, Gabriel Byrne and Jurgen Prochnow. Soundtrack by Tangerine Dream. As they say, be careful what you wish for. I would have put the genie back in the bottle after this one. The special effects suffer badly from the progress that's been made since this was filmed. Points for being the first film I recall with those thick neck muscles on the demon going down to the collarbone repeated most recently in the last Avengers film. And the smoke being sucked up and recycled around the (?) is still a nice effect. But the script is clumsy, at least the way it's revealed. It's almost as though the editing was done by a studio hack that wanted to get it off the movieola as quick as possible, You tend to not want to blame Mann for this mess in light of his later brilliant career.but maybe it was a learning curve after ""Thief"".

The movie is clearly made from a videotape recording. It's very  blurry and the image (4:3), has the ""tearing"" top and bottom that you see in some VCR recordings.

The movie is visually interesting, and the Tangerine Dream score is hypnotic (though sometimes annoying).  What I like about this movie is the handling of a rare and difficult theme:  what really separates good from evil, and how do you keep good from becoming evil?  Could using evil, to accomplish good, be justifiable?

Yes, the story is clunky, the monster is a guy in a big rubber suit, and the ending simply stinks -- but doggone it I like this bad movie!  I wish Mann would allow it to be restored, released on disc, and include the hours of deleted material that might have made it a better movie.  Maybe even a director's cut?

241448,2,6300214346,"WHen I saw the names, Scott Glenn, Ian McKellum and Gabriel Byrne, as starring in this evidently low budget supernatural yarn, I thought ""how bad could it be?"" Well, I ate those proverbial words quite rapidly as I tried to make sense of this film set in World War II Romania.  Of course, anything set in that land of Count Dracula lends a mysterious air but the infiltration of German soldiers into a medieval ""Keep"" inhabited by a cross between Hellboy and Shrek provided some serious nap time for me.  The plot is too silly to recount fully but the bare bones of it is, the Germans are bad, and everyone else is better.  Scott Glenn wears some funky colored contacts for his role as Glaeken, the mysterious stranger. Gabriel Byrne struts his Irish stuff around as a German Stormtrooper and tries to bring some real acting to the movie but the part is stilted and predictable and you don't care when he explodes later on. (sorry for the spoiler, NOT)  .  Ian McKellum is perhaps the strangest character in this whole strange film. He is a ""Medieval scholar"" , and a Jew who is in a concentration camp suffering from scleroderma. In other words,he is a mess, as is his really weird American accent. McKellum, so famous for his powerful presence in Lord of the RIngs and the X Men films, sounds positively deflated here. Why would the director,Michael Mann, have insisted that so robust a voice be shut down to a mere squeal during most of the movie?  Perhaps because the movie was made in 1983? Did McKellum have to practice the next 25 years to get his Gandalf on?  No matter, you will get slightly sick at the performance mostly because you are watching an actor that has been knighted and has won an incredible amount of awards. Here he makes friends with the twin from the remake of The Fog.  The ending is a bummer only because by now McKellum's daughter,( yes she came with him from the camp) is in love with Scott Glenn and Glenn is this kind of sacrificial god like persona,oh well you know the archetype. I read that Mann had another ending in mind, a HAPPY ending but he was too long winded for Paramount so they squashed it and got it over with quick.  Don't watch this film. Watch the movies that these A list actors went on to make later on and spare yourself the trips to the bathroom.

241518,4,6300214346,"I have no ""skin in the game"". I'm not a fan of Tangerine Dream or Michael Mann. I actually thought the soundtrack dated the film more than the visuals. I've also never read the book, so this is the review of someone watching with fresh eyes.

Reading some of the reviews, I'm glad the director originally made a 3 hour version of the film. What I saw was good, and it hinted at so much more.

Honestly, for much of the movie, I was rooting for the monster. It was absolutely understandable why someone at this point in history would. That's all I'll say about that, aside from it being good for a story to not have an ""absolute"" good or evil established too soon in a story. Humans are flawed by nature, and good storytelling is a reflection of our own struggle with morality.

Watch it, by all means. The acting is top-notch, and I think this movie would be phenomenal with a remake with today's effects. Just because every other decent review seems to somehow LOVE Tangerine Dream, to me it just sounds like a kid had just gotten a synthesizer in the early 80s. That said, I was a kid who had gotten a synthesizer in the early 80s.

I suppose that given the state of the art in 1983 the technical aspects were fairly good for the time but they sure are cheesy today.

241810,2,6300214346,"I honestly kind of feel bad for giving this movie a two star rating but the truth is that it is bad. Before watching this film I read the average to above average review ratings from fans of Michael Manning and fans of the book by the same name. The reviews were pretty consistent in the fact that the movie was a rush job and you won't understand most of it if you haven't read the book. This is true on so many levels. One review mentioned that this film was suppose to be 3 hours in length but because it was going over budget and taking to long to film they cut a 3 hour movie down to 90 minutes. Trust me on this that it is painfully obvious a lot of things were edited out for the sake of time and the movie suffered for that.

Spoiler Start:

There is a part in the movie where the female lead is raped by a Nazi soldier and then a day later shares a room with a stranger at an Inn and has sex with him the same day (or following day). This was very strange to me since the movie established that from the moment the demon speaks to the father after rescuing the girl from the rape that he has three days to get rid of the talisman. In short I find it strange someone who was just raped could engage in sex with a total stranger the following day.

The Keep is a spiritual horror film with many flaws but is worth a view because Mann makes it a cut above of the usual movies of this genre. Plus if you are familiar with F.

Little-by-little, the creature escapes the  inner confines of The Keep, but can't go any further without outside help.....which it gets by threatening the the daughter of a professor of ancient history.

It has a decent storyline: typically arrogant and evil Nazi's take over a keep deep in the Carpathian Mountains where greed and boredom cause them to unleash an even greater evil than their own. The problem becomes that the subplots necessary for the story's resolve feel like a series of disconnected vignettes... like a bunch of the film erroneously ended up on the editing room floor. The low-budget special effects and rather poor production value don't help. Actually, this is a prime candidate for a remake, although the nature of suspense and horror has changed so much that it's difficult to see that happening.

243581,1,6300214346,"This has to be one of the worst, if not THE worst, movies I have ever subjected myself to.  The premise is time-worn and poorly executed.  The acting would have been less wooden if they had used marionettes.  Prochnow in Das Boot and Byrne in Excalibur had successes prior to this 1983 dud, not to mention Sir Ian McKellan.  They, the rest of the cast and production staff mailed in their performances via slow-boat media rate mail.  A major portion of the film is obscured by the ever present fog of evil fog machines and unending dust storms (in Romanian mountain passes?).  If the foggy cinematography wasn't bad enough, the uneven ""music"" had not only predictable overplayed crescendos but very little but aimlessly discordant musical riffs in between.

To make things worse, the entire mystical plot doesn't get tied up in any fashion.  ATTENTION!  SPOILER ALERT!
Plot:  It seems that there is an EEEVIL force locked up inside this ""Keep"".  There are specifically 108 silver...no, brushed nickel...no, chrome plated - whatever - crosses on the interior walls.  Nazis take up camp inside the keep and promptly try to remove a cross or two as private plunder, only to meet flesh liquefying, bone-crushing death of some sort (too much fog).  Dude in a Greek port gets a psychic tweet and heads off...towards the keep?!?  Dunno.  Long story short:  Nazis almost release EEEVIL held in the keep because that's what they do, they're Nazis.  Latest in a long line of ""Keepers"" (I'm guessing 108 previous bros.) comes and shuts EEEVIL back in the keep - leaving 109 total crosses, I'm guessing.  That still doesn't explain the completely non-sequitur (gratuitous?) sex scene - unless the current ""Keeper"" is repriming the keep with its next ""Keeper"".  We'll never know.  If you disregard my warning not too watch this film, take note this film is set in 1941 (why? who knows) and there is loose talk regarding ""death camps""  which didn't begin until 1943.

But if you want a film to actually make some sense and explain to you important characters and plot points, look elsewhere.

Other reviewers have lamented Paramount Studios ruining Michael Mann's vision for this movie. Well, this isn't Film Appreciation 101 in college; this is a review site. Whatever Paramount did or didn't do, this movie is awful. Viewers have no idea why the two protagonists -- the demonic presence in the Keep and the angelic being (Scott Glenn) pursuing him -- are destined to meet. What's the backstory?

So the demon represents the evil inside all of us, and he wants out of the Keep to wreak havoc. Well, this film is set in 1941, and World War II is in the process of killing 60 million humans, roughly 3% of the world's population. How could things get any worse if the demon escapes? Are we supposed to believe the Axis would have won the war if he got out? And if he's so evil, why is he killing Nazis while sparing the Jews and anti-fascists?

The ""special"" effects, even for the era, are laughable. In many scenes, Michael Mann filmed a smoke machine pumping out fog, and then simply ran the film backward to make it look like it was moving purposefully. The all-powerful talisman that keeps the demon in his Keep? It's a flashlight, folks,

The German officers are ridiculous caricatures. There's the typical murderous SS major vs. the honorable, anti-fascist Wehrmacht captain. But wait: Does anyone believe for a second that an SS major would let a lowly captain harangue him again and again, questioning his orders and his honor? Ahem, majors outrank captains. In real life, the major would have immediately arrested the captain and thrown him into the dungeon.

And if he came for such an important task as killing the monster and saving the world, I guess we can't blame him for taking time out for a quick roll-in-the-hay.

243800,4,6300214346,"If half stars existed, I'd give this 3 1/2 starts, between ok and like.

It's 1983, so the special effects are primitive, to say the least. Flash Gordon was from 3 years earlier and seemed far superior.

Spoiler alert below here.

It seems to deal with a golem or two, and the fact that I don't know the answer whether it's 1 or 2 is part of why I don't like it.

A golem is part of Jewish mysticism, a being brought to life out of something inanimate, say clay. There's a golem in a custom made prison, the keep. The Nazis move into the keep, because it's a very secure building, start messing with the golem's prison and the golem starts killing them. The Nazis bring in a Jewish man and his daughter to help figure out what's going on.

Then there's another mystical being, he has snow flakes of light fall on him when bad golem is woken, and he starts traveling towards the keep. He's in a flat somewhere else, not a keep. He doesn't cast a reflection in a mirror, has spooky eye contacts, can make men do things with his eyes and bleeds green slime. He drives a moped. If you're immortal and you job is to keep evil at bay, you should stay right there, like in The Sentinel. So the golem locked up is evil and the one free is good. He said he's been waiting, probably for hundreds of years, for the bad golem to wake up. Really? So why'd he move away then? Cheaper rent and better cable? He knows a place with great coffee and wanted to be near it?

Some people love the music saying how great Tangerine Dream is. If you have Amazon Prime check out the music at 24:00 or 1:23:00 in and tell me if they're right or if I'm right :) It was inappropriate for this type of movie. Tangerine Dream may be fine, as may Country and Western, but neither is appropriate for this movie.

Nazis keep dying in the keep, but they don't just walk outside of the keep to the village or anything.

A lot of the special effects are massive amount of smoke being generated, played forward or backward in time.

When the good golem sends the bad golem back into the depths of the keep, he gets sucked in with him. No idea what that means. Bad golem was put there before and the good golem had the flat with the cable and the coffee, right? I just didn't understand.

There were a lot of stars in this, it had potential to be great, it just didn't live up to its potential in my mind. Jurgen Prochnow is usually great in these movies, like The Seventh Sign. He was ok in this one, the movie was just slow around him.

If I asked someone to watch this with me and told them they'd be pleased, I think I'd get hit in the face with a pillow afterwards.

Not a scary movie in at all any way.",1450569600,,2670,4.153100775193798

243867,4,6300214346,"I remember watching this film when I was younger and always wondered why it was placed into the horror genre. It comes off more like a sci fi movie more than anything else.

Set during WW2, The Keep puts forth an original story while enlisting the talent of several great actors. Essentially, the Germans move into a small town to take over an old deserted Keep.  The only people who enter The Keep, are a family that takes care of the it generation after generation. As soon as the Germans move in though, tragedy befalls them. Several of their men begin to die off in violent ways. At first, partisans are thought to be the cause, but in reality, something much darker is to blame. It leads to a Platoon of SS troops moving in, to get to the bottom of the situation. But they don't fair much better. Anyway the film takes a few interesting twists and turns until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

One of the areas that makes The Keep stand so much out was the direction Michael Mann decided to take it. For one, the soundtrack was performed by Tangerine Dream, you know the guys that did the U.S. soundtrack for the movie Legend, starring Tom Cruise. So that already gives you an idea of how this film went down an artsy route. But besides the music, it uses a lot of filming effects that were coming of age during the 80's. Many times they could be seen in Music Videos of that era. The lighting, the camera angles, even the antagonist himself, looks like something out of a futuristic 80's video. At the time, that style could be seen in other films too like Blade Runner, Legend, even Nightmare on Elm Street 4 the Dream Master.

But even with all that art in the film, it still has a few problems. The main one being, it doesn't develop some of the characters very well. Scott Glenn, in general, needed to have a lot more information given about his character, so we could understand him and who he was. The female lead, Alberta Watson, seemed like eye candy more than anything else. And it's strange to say it, but the two German officers were probably the most interesting characters to watch in the whole film. One was SS the other was regular German army, and they didn't always see eye to eye. Jrgen Prochnow played the Army officer and Gabriel Byrne the SS officer. Both of them could have used more screen time. But when they were up, the film was always more interesting. And we can't leave out Ian McKellen as the conflicted Jewish Archeologist. You know, the guy who played Gandalf.

Overall, I think this could have been a stronger film had it been given a longer running time. I know that sounds strange. But in this case, some of the characters should have been flushed out more. And I think it's that lack of a stronger backstory that keeps this film as a mid tier cult classic.

So in the end, I'm giving the The Keep a 4. It might be more like a 3, but it still holds up as an interesting art film. Worth at least one viewing, if you have an interest in it.",1449964800,,2997,4.352415026833632

For someone who HASN'T seen the first of the film and is wondering whether or not to watch it, I would say you would need an interest in early 80's film especially oddball films and movies like Swamp Thing. The Nazi angle makes me want to compare it to an Indiana Jones movie but I'd be more likely to compare it to something like Jaws or Critters with a decent plot and presumeably filmed on location in the Carpathian Mountains. Pretty chill movie, sit back and soak up the 80's.",1443744000,2,1055,4.415384615384616

I love this film, but on Amazon Prime it's so ""washed out, flecks, etc."" If anyone has purchased the DVD, can they tell me if the print has been cleaned up? Also, the sound level isn't consistent on Prime, is it better on DVD? I do love this film, but it was a total let down when watching it streamed, though I watched it twice. I recall seeing it at the theaters and the print was clear, the artwork on the monastery stood out, the part when the German soldier looks down really gave an impression of depth. On Prime, it was very difficult to see.",1443398400,,655,4.290322580645161
244281,4,6300214346,"I have a love-hate relationship with ""The Keep"".  Its atmosphere is brilliantly rendered, and the main cast contains early performances of some fine actors, although not in their best roles -- Gabriel Byrne, for example as the head Nazi, in constrained by a script that makes his character a cartoon, but he does  workmanlike job with the material at hand.  The concept and script are very imaginative and off-beat (in a good way.)  On the other hand, the special effects, at least in terms of the ""critter"" -- are unconvincing (look at the ""cover picture"" as an example.)  There are also holes in the plot that require serious suspension of disbelief. Overall, I would assess ""The Keep"" as a memorable movie (I carried the memory of parts of it for years) but not particularly good as a horror movie.  It's also morally muddy in terms of anti-Semitism.  (One of the main characters, expertly rendered by Ian McKellan, is a Jew who collaborates with the Nazis for reasons that it would be a spoiler to reveal.)",1443225600,,1010,4.7371428571428575

244284,1,6300214346,"When I look at the glowing reviews I think I must have seen a different movie. I could write a book about what is wrong with this movie. My only explanation that it a training film for Michael Mann. The foreground is in vivid color, but the background is washed out. The acting is 3rd rate. The direction is amateur. You can see that in the beginning with the closeup of any eye done several times. The boat scene in the beginning was done poorly and too long. The regular army officer tells the SS officer that 5 men have been killed since arriving,  we only see one man killed.  I can not believe that 2 German soldiers would abandoned their posts. I did my time in the 60's and a friend was caught sleeping on past and served 6 months in the stockade.  This was the American Army. The only redeeming value is probably Michael Mann used this exercise as a starting point in his career when he should have made a Roger Corman film to break his teeth on. I had higher hopes when I looked at the actors involved. The film reminded me of a '30 film where that actors perform in  a stilted manner.",1443139200,3,1094,4.2451923076923075

244365,3,6300214346,"When Michael Mann made ""The Keep"" everybody wanted to work with him. When Mann completed the film he turned in an early version running about 3 hours and it's clear that, at least in the case of Paramount Had changed their minds.

""The Keep"" finds Mann trying to balance a blockbuster movie horror flick against stylish visuals and in a genre he was clearly uncomfortable working in. If you add in some truly atmospheric visuals, a plot that seems lost in the mist, hammy acting and some bad pre-CGI visual effects (although the final creature itself is impressive  looking and wouldn't work as well in CGI IMHO), you have a film that starts off ambitious but loses it amid the confusion of the second and third acts of the film.

That's when the disaster struck.

The studio/producers took the film away from Mann and reduced a film that was as vsually arresting as ""Thief"" into a typical almost incomprehensible horror movie. It's clear that the film was going to take a much less conventional approach from what remained.

Not a surprise that ""The Keep"" is one film that Mann doesn't want to return to and, honestly, who knows what remains of his original 3 hour cut of the movie.

As it stands ""The Keep"" looks interesting but has little substance to it and the performances by Scott Glenn, Sir Ian McKellen, Gabriel Bryne are very stylized and just a wee bit over the top. It kind of works for the movie but would have worked better with more of their performances as what we get are almost operatic and out-of-the-blue moments missing any build up to their moments. It's like listening to a series of crescendos--after awhile you become dulled to those moments and they are almost comical.

SPOILERS:

Nazi soldiers led by Capt. Klaus Woermann (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow)  occupy a castle in Dinu Mountain Pass following the commencement Operation Barbarossa. The castle or ""keep"" wasn't designed as a fortess to keep people out but something evil within. Woermann orders a Jewish historian, Prof. Theodore Cuza (McKellen) to be removed form a concentration camp along with his daughter Eva to translate ancient writing inside the keep. Later, two of Woermann's men release the creature from the keep. As a result, Woermann is relieved of command by an SS Officer Erich Kaempffer (Byrne) and Cuza allies himself with the creature--calling itself Molasar-- which is taking physical form to destroy the Nazi's.

Eva (the late Alberta Watson ) meets and becomes romantically involved with Glaeken Trismegestus (Glenn) a supernatural being in human form that is the nemesis of Molasar. Glaeken must face the creature and prevent it from escaping the castle.

END OF SPOILERS:

As with ""Thief"", Mann's film is often stunning to look at with a brilliant production design and moody atmospheric lighting that doesn't translate to the SD low rez.

The Amazon presentation is the only way to currently see a widescreen presentation of the film (at the time of this writing). The transfer isn't the best and, honestly, the streaming was crap (but that's another story entirely because it has to do with Amazon, the Xfinity and the compression used) but watchable. Audio sounded fine.

It's a pity given the cult audience that has built up around ""The Keep"" that no attempt has been made to restore the film (much like happened recently for ""Phase IV"" another ambitious but troubled production from the 1970's. Unfortunately, as of this writing, it hasn't been released on Blu-ray with its restored ending) from what exists of the negatives. It would be a fairly expensive undertaking but one that might be worth it. I doubt it would make ""The Keep"" a better film but it would make it more coherent and in keeping with Mann's original vision (author F. Paul Wilson who wrote the novel has gone on record as hating the film) and Mann's brilliant looking visuals would be seen the way that they were meant to be.

I suspect that some of the hold up for this being released to DVD and/or Blu-ray is the score by Tangerine Dream and the clearance for home video (the score is quite effective by the way). Perhaps Paramount doesn't feel this is worth pursuing or,perhaps, they are hoping that Mann will return to rework the material (they've never made an offer to the best of my knowledge) but, either way, it would be nice to see this restored to the film Mann intended all along.

""The Keep"" isn't a great or necessarily even a good horror film but it could be much better than the truncated version presented here.",1435968000,14,4503,4.7984496124031

BOTTOM LINE? It STUNK! I shut it off and will wait for a PROPER Blu ray rendering.

I'm VERY disappointed in Amazon for touting this film is HD, well, it IS HD and it's THE WORST HD presentation I've EVER seen!

244966,2,6300214346,"How singularly odd . . . this video caused my computer to shut down and required a restart . . . could it have been a reaction to my viewing selection?  Sci-fi or horror film, the book isn't a match! 'The Keep' was the first volumn in 'The Adversary Cycle' by F. Paul Wilson. Storyline, cinematography and acting were not the quality expected. If you are interested in this genre, perhaps you can find some redeeming features. WWII? Too many mistakes in the production and directing to allow any semblance of reality. Then again, that's what was intended. The 'out of focus' format was intentional but detracted rather than enhanced the viewing. Decided it had to get better but it didn't. Watch at your own risk!

For some reason I wasn't able to access the reviews before watching . . . 'gothic horror' or otherwise, this is one that I would have chosen to miss.

245202,4,6300214346,"This movie has a great cast delivering great performances, a spooky soundtrack by Tangerine Dream (better known for the Legend and Firestarter soundtracks), a setting that is essentially its own character, and masterful direction and cinematography.  It has everything a great movie should have.  But it has two specific flaws that keep it from being a truly great movie (or at least a truly great horror movie).

First, it commits the cardinal sin of many horror movies: it shows the monster.  A good horror movie should never show the monster, at least until the final act.  The audience will fill in the void with something more personally terrifying and more effective than anything the filmmakers could show.  Here, we see the creature about halfway through the movie, and it's... less than impressive.  Heck, it's shown here on the video cover.  Admittedly, the design and effects were good for the early 80s, but it's still a rather stiff and non-expressive model/suit.  And it's not really that scary.

The second problem is that while the basic plot is pretty straightforward, the details are considerably less so.  I certainly don't think a movie should tie everything up in a bow and explain every detail by its conclusion, but practically nothing was explained here.  By the end of the movie, we know barely more about the entities than we did at the beginning.  Were they angelic/demonic?  Were they aliens or extradimensional?  Does it matter?  Even their names are just mentioned in passing.  On one hand, it does enhance the mystery, but if that was the goal, they shouldn't have shown the creature as mentioned earlier.  On the other hand...  a movie is a story, and this story feels incomplete because so little is told about some of the main characters.  Without some more flesh on those bones, those characters are just empty shells, without much on which the audience can hang any kind of emotional attachment whether that be sympathy or fear.

It's still a great movie, but it's less a horror movie than a gothic supernatural thriller, and it might leave you feeling a bit hollow.  As long as you don't expect to be terrified or for everything to be wrapped up in a box by the conclusion, it's definitely worth your time.",1400198400,,2243,4.847368421052631

There they inadvertently release something. This something is indiscriminately dispatching shoulders and SS alike. The evil force allies with a Jewish man for freedom to dispatch the balance of the SS. An itinerant stranger (Scott Glenn) appears and is opposed to the release of the mysterious force.

We kibitz as the story unfolds. The movie is not as one dimensional as the plot based on a book by F. Paul Wilson appears.  There is a philosopher solder (Jrgen Prochnow) and a love interest (Alberta Watson) among other interests. The music in the presentation is just as important as any character.
------------------
 I have seen several versions from T.V. to streaming. The TV version seems to have cut out the scene of Scott and Alberta messing around in their birthday suits. The streaming looks like it was never premastered.

The directing or flow of the film is a little choppy, the scenes do not flow seamless together but instead appear as individual scenes, but it does effectively tell the story.  Speaking of which, the story is very good with grand themes of good vs evil mixed in with personal choices of good and evil and how they effect each other.

There is an ancient evil locked behind the thick walls of the Keep. The Nazi's come & unwittingly release the evil. Now there is only survival, until a stranger comes.

Though denounced as a piece of pizzle by critics & many horror fans a like, this film has developed a cult following. I have to number myself as one of the cult.

""The Keep"" draws me in with it's phenomenal cinematography, so beautiful, it's like watching a animated painted masterpiece, a wash in brilliant swirling colors. Of course, it gorgeous filming location has a lot to do with it. It also has deep dark atmospheric cinematography in the Keep it's self, adding a tangible aura of menace to the film. The scene where the Nazi's find the deep dark cavern & unleash the long imprisoned  evil entity, while digging for silver crosses,  is a testament to the power of the camera to ingrain images to one's mind. It's haunting ethereal sound track by Tangerine Dream, which makes everything in this film seem larger than life, fits the cryptic story line like a spider to a web.

""The Keep"" is haunting, ethereal, & most of all cryptic. It does not give you an explanation for it's protagonist & antagonist, & that's part of it's charm, it really does not have too. All you need to know is there is good & evil, good & evil in men, & beyond. It is a triumph of style over substance, yet there is substance to this film. The substance of dreams, escape, power. The fair hearted Nazi Captain, & his struggle with what his country has became. His struggle with the S.S. Lieutenant, sent to find out who is killing the Nazi troops. The aspirations of the concentration camp released aging Jewish Scholar, who finds youth & power, & begins to become the thing he hates most. Yes, this film has substance, & a great cast of actors to fill that substance with convincing portrayals of individuals caught up in something they don't/can't understand. So goes us as an audience, if the characters don't understand their situation, then this film puts us in their mind set, which I feel is a great asset, & so many find frustrating.

Even after all of this I wrote, I know ""The Keep"" is an acquired tasted. This is a film you either love or hate. I don't think I've found anyone to be on the middle ground here. One thing is for sure though, this film begs a Blu ray upgrade. If only for the magnificent cinematography & soundtrack, which really is pure art!",1379548800,,2437,4.512471655328798

245753,4,6300214346,"This film's most memorable line comes early on, as a Wehrmacht captain played by Jrgen Prochnow examines the old structure he has been asked to occupy and comments ""the walls are thicker toward the middle, and thinner toward the outside. This place was not built to keep people out; it was built to hold something in.""

As most will know, this is the story of an ancient being in a Romanian ""keep"" that is unleashed by and feeds upon Nazis during the second world war. He teams with a Jewish scholar who has been freed from a concentration camp in order to help the Nazis defend themselves. The film is much more sophisticated than most films of this type in its attitude towards evil. It distinguishes between the professional soldiers of the Wehrmacht and the political officers of the SS, portraying the former as potentially noble compared to the latter. Even the monster within the keep behaves in an essentially admirable manner until the very end, killing only Nazis, defending a woman from rape, healing the sick Jewish scholar. He expresses outrage that Romanian villagers have been mistreated by the Nazis and vows to avenge them.

The film's greatest weakness, I think, is its pacing. It's impossible to tell how much time passes between scenes, though sometimes it seems to be weeks (they mention the need to retrieve the Jewish scholar from a concentration camp, and then in the next scene he has arrived in Romania). We never see the Nazis discussing what's happening to them or developing theories about the threat. Ian McKellen is healed and made decades younger and for the longest time nobody seems to notice or comment on it. Scott Glenn's behavior is similarly odd (though that can perhaps be forgiven as he is playing some sort of immortal being whose motivations may be beyond our understanding).",1377561600,,1818,4.842443729903537

You can decide for yourself if the graphic-comic-style plot pitting Nazis against an ancient evil spirit is your tankard of ale ('Hellboy' fans, perhaps?), but the devil is in the execution. What works: an intriguing ersatz-Romanian location with often lavish sets and suitably spooky cinematography to match, pretty effective casting, some fun pre-CGI special effects, and a story that pulls you in even if ultimately it crumbles beneath its cumbersome premise. What doesn't work: a mostly silly script, moments of weak acting (even by the venerable Ian McKellan), spotty editing, and a cloyingly inappropriate electronic soundtrack by '80s avant-gardist Tangerine Dream. So, in all, kind of a wash with lofty visuals and atmosphere being weighed down by technical and narrative pot metal. 2 1/2 stars (I might have given it an extra half-star for box-office singularity had we not seen Nazis running afoul of supernatural forces in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' released just two years prior).",1363305600,2,1119,5.222222222222222

THE STORY: During World War II, the Nazis are expanding beyond the borders of Germany to supplement their resources and they arrive at a grim, gothic shrine-fortress of a sort in Romania. Against the advice of the locals, they inhabit the place where a few soldiers get greedy for silver ornamentation that they loot here and there and which leads to their nightmarish demise. This pulls in the Schutzstaffel [SS] who become ruthless in their interrogations and executions. Ironically, these butchers find themselves dependent upon a Jewish historian in their attempt to unravel the mystery of The Keep. A stranger with unique powers also arrives to take on the evil presence but alliances keep shifting.

Here's a great quotation from the film:

Eva Cuza: ""We're dealing with a Golem! A Devil!""

Dr. Theodore Cuza: ""A Devil? Now you listen to me. The Devil in the Keep wears a black uniform, has a Death's Head in his cap, and calls himself a Sturmbannfhrer!""

This film scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it, (a year ago), and I have viewed it many times since. It's a outstanding film, with a focus on the story and not on the actors.

245956,4,6300214346,"A movie that is as divisive as it is confounding at times, 1983's The Keep is a Michael Mann-directed horror film based on the F. Paul Wilson novel of the same name.

In 1941 Romania, German soldiers under the command of the not entirely unreasonable Captain Klaus Woermann are sent to guard the Dinu Pass in the Carpathian Mountains near a small town. Here they find an abandoned but still maintained citadel known locally as ""the keep,"" whose purpose and origin are unknown even to the people who look after it. It is constructed ""backwards,"" Woermann notices, with the largest stones inside the keep instead of outside. Rather than being built to keep something out, it is seemingly designed to keep something in. Furthermore, the walls in every room are lined with crosses made of what the creepy old caretaker claims are nickel.

Woermann and his men take up residence in the keep despite the dire warnings of the caretaker. That night, a couple of enterprising soldiers who insist the crosses are made of silver, not nickel, take it upon themselves to try and chisel one out. They unwittingly unleash something mean and nasty that had been imprisoned within the bowels of the keep, something which disintegrates the first German above the waist and then completely blasts the second apart with an unseen power.

At the same instant, somewhere in Greece, a mysterious man, Glaeken Trismegestus, is awoke from his sleep as if from a nightmare. Glaeken, who makes his living as a fisherman, quits his job that night and immediately undertakes a journey to Romania, carrying something in a long case with him.

Back in Romania, the Waffen-SS under the command of the brutal sadist Major Erich Kaempffer shows up in town. Kaempffer, believing the deaths of the German soldiers to be partisan activity, has some of the townspeople rounded up and shot over the protests of Captain Woermann and the village priest, Father Fonescu. After dissuading Kaempffer from executing anyone else, he shows him something the unseen force wrote on the wall in an ancient language. Fonescu claims only one person can translate it, Dr. Theodore Cuza, who is an expert in early Romanian history. But, being Jewish, Cuza and his daughter Eva are currently in the nearest concentration camp.

Kaempffer pulls strings and has the ailing, elderly, wheelchair-bound Cuza and his daughter brought to the keep, where Dr. Cuza translates the writing - ""I Will Be Free."" In the meantime, Glaeken, after getting past the Romanian border guards through sheer intimidation, arrives in town, and despite having some kind of specific mission in mind he immediately begins making goo-goo eyes at Eva and before you know it, hot 80's boinking is happening between the pair.

In the meantime, Cuza is contacted by the thing in the keep, an evil entity named Radu Molasar, who feeds off of people's lives and is gradually growing more powerful - and more physical, turning into a human-like beast. Molasar claims that he will not only cure Cuza's illness but also make him young again, if only Cuza will do something for him in return.

Cuza, who sees Molasar as a possible weapon against the Nazis, readily agrees. But is Molasar telling the truth? And what connection does the secretive Glaeken have to Molasar and the keep itself?

The Keep is a fascinating film that is more style than substance. Director Michael Mann uses music and visuals to tell the story, mostly, and the script is weak and often confusing thanks in no small part to the removal of entire scenes for the final cut (an entire sequence establishing Eva and Glaeken's attraction to one another was cut, meaning the two essentially start having sex right after now), but the movie is saved by the haunting synth score done by Tangerine Dream and by some stellar performances by Ian McKellan (as Cuza), Jrgen Prochnow (as Woermann) and Gabriel Byrne (as Kaempffer) make the movie worthwhile.",1341619200,5,3926,4.911010558069382
245957,3,6300214346,"I find it odd you cannot get this on DVD but you can stream it on Netflix. Go figure. It was an Okay view but I don't see it sticking with me.

Here's the scoop. The Nazis roll into a town in the Carpathian mountains and occupy an odd castle where the walls are adorned with a particular kind of cross made of nickle. Some greedy soldiers think one of the crosses is made of silver and, while trying to pry it off the wall, loose a demonic force. As the force begins to slowly kill the soldiers, Ian McKellen is brought in, along with his daughter, to determine the source of the evil. This is an oversimplification but it should do.

The opening shot could have been lifted right from Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" released about six years prior. That both movies sport a soundtrack penned by Tangerine Dream pretty much nails that. But the visual impressiveness of this early Michael Mann outing is about all it has going for it. I haven't read the book on which it based but I have to guess something was lost in the translation. This just doesn't hang together. The subtext of the evil in the keep being the same as the evil outside is handled clumsily. It was done much better in ""Predator."" And it all feels disjointed. And the Scott Glenn character is a bit of a mystery. He seems to exist for no other reason than to fight the evil in the event it's let loose. What a boring job to hang out for thousands of years in case you're needed. And what's his need to have a sexual encounter with McKellen's daughter. He's not really human and the encounter seemed to serve no purpose in the story.

You simply have to sit down and read ""The Keep"" to appreciate how intense, vibrant, and terrifying the real story is. The movie is at best, a pale shadow and a ham fisted muddled mess. Not that there were not some good performances by some of the actors,
you just had a director that thought he knew more about what makes a great story than the author did.

This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen and any one who says otherwise has either a: never read the book or b: has a high tolerance for bad movies and really bad music (okay, I know, it's an 80s movie and the music is very 80s). Yes, it was probably very technically advanced for '83, but it doesn't change the fact that it isn't even close to the actual book.  The only similarity between the characters in the book and the characters in the movie are their names.  The motives of the characters, the personalities, and in the case of Rasalom (not Molasar as he is called for the ENTIRE movie) he isn't even remotely the right being.  What disappointed me most of all was the fact that the more interesting and thought provoking parts of the book were left out entirely, and what was put in was the bare skeleton of a brilliantly written story.  Sometimes it appeared the director and writers hadn't even read F. Paul Wilson's The Keep, but another book entirely.  The movie is more sci-fi than horror, badly written, poorly acted (by some actors-others were good), there is a strong-over use of slow-motion, the soundtrack plays over the dialog at times, and for God's sake they took away Glaeken's sword therefore completely destroying the entire point of the ""crosses"" placed around the keep.

246035,3,6300214346,"The Keep was broadcast in two parts many years ago. I saw the first half and would have liked to see the second because I thought the first was distinctly good. I recently stumbled across some references to it, from which I learned that the film was based on a book, and that the book was by F Paul Wilson, of whom I had not even heard. Comment from sources I have come to find reliable was along the lines that the film was not up to the book. In that case, I thought, better to give the film a chance while the book is still in the post.

It can't have been the book, therefore, and I hope it wasn't just the comment, that makes me conclude that the film is far better earlier than later. I reacted to the early scenes this time round much as I did last time - I thought they were excellent, and I was at that stage prepared to award the film 5 stars. 4-star standard overtook the production around half way, but by the end I could not see my way, even on some smoothed-out average evaluation, beyond a third star.

The production in general, and the camera work in particular, are absolutely outstanding to begin with. The atmosphere is heavy with sinister menace, and the set by and large, particularly the brooding Keep of course, is anyone's idea of nameless lurking horror. The imprisoned fiend is released by the thieving nazis, but as he progressively takes shape he deflates the quality of the narrative and even of the production as a whole. In the course of attaining his resonant bass boom he passes through a disconcertingly polite-sounding English public school diction. His intermediate-stage costume is surprisingly amateurish looking. It does not seem to be clear in the director's mind whether the phantom is set on avenging the wrongs inflicted by the occupiers or on just being a general all-round baddy.

This last ambiguity seems to reflect the rather different story in the book, to go by what I have been told so far. The deaths of the storm-troopers are linked in the book, I gather, to Transylvanian vampires, and the vampirism is portrayed as some allegory of fascism. In the film the escaped entity likewise appears only to target the more unpleasant Germans, but this didn't seem to me to sit naturally with its general persona as just a Large Nasty. Similarly, when asked by the Jewish professor who or what it is, it replies `I am of you', which seems to imply that it is a monster projected from the general human id. However that is not the sole possession and prerogative of nazis still less of a sick old Jewish professor, and I could not see why from either angle such an embodiment would target the particular victims it selects.

That is an anomaly in the plot. The production takes a turn for the worse in parallel, and I believe the mistake has been in trying to make the effects too literal, rather than keeping at least some aura of the unexplained about them, as at the start. The talisman that the professor is bidden to take out of the Keep by his sinister new associate just looks like a rather ordinary torch or flashlight. As the denouement approaches, the talisman is attached in self-assembly mode to what resembles either a bazooka or just an ordinary length of black plastic piping, and the monster gets its final comeuppance from Jedi-like beams aimed from the kit as finally joined up. The agent of this outcome is a mysterious stranger with paranormal powers played by Scott Glenn who has come from somewhere unstated for precisely this purpose, only taking a short break for an energetic if solemn-faced bout of passion with the heroine, to whom he has hardly been introduced. It may be symbolic in some way, but in view of the urgency of his overall mission one has to suspect that this is screen sex for its own sake. After all he shows up, ravishes the fair maiden in double-quick time, announces that in destroying the monster he will be putting an end to himself as well, gives no answer to the heroine's enquiries as to what he thought he was doing in that case, and is duly spirited away into some other state of being or nothingness after achieving his ostensible objective as well.

The acting by the principals is not bad, but the only distinguished performance is from (surprise) McKellen as the elderly professor. The storm-troopers are slightly cast as pantomime nazis of the Ve haff Vays school, and my feeling is that the real foulness of who and what they were would have been conveyed better without such mechanical caricaturing. The real mechanical caricature is, sadly, the very monster who promised so atmospherically to keep us thrilled when the film started. A pity really. That start was very good indeed, but the director loses his way between the kind of allegory that I gather Wilson intended and a rather hammed-up general horror thriller with second hand effects from Raiders of the Lost Ark.",1197676800,3,4877,4.6270207852194

246109,3,6300214346,"The Keep is quite literally a shadow of its former self. Michael Mann originally shot this film with a reputed running length of about 3 hours. However, the studio - Paramount got cold feet with a budget overrun, fired Mann, and severely edited the work in progress to about a 90 minute run time. Naturally being cut in half was never going to enhance the film and achieved the reverse. What was probably an in depth and complex adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's superb novel of the same title became a largely incomprehensible mess to anyone who had not read the book. The result was a Box Office flop on its release, accompanied by largely damning reviews from most critics. It acquired something of a cult status on its video release though. That said, many fans of Michael Mann are often astonished that that they have not heard of it or in fact seen it.

Set in WW2 Romania, a garrison of German soldiers are assigned to guard a seemingly deserted Keep, deep in the Carpathian mountains. Their captain, played by Jurgen Prochnow is dismayed to learn, however, that the Keep is not as empty as originally thought but in fact is home to something ancient, evil and very powerful and which embarks on killing his men. An SS contingent arrives to back up the embattled soldiers, led by a vicious Gabriel Byrne. The SS believe the local villagers to be responsible and embark on a series of atrocities. However, this just seems to make the situation worse. Accompanying the SS is a Jewish professor, played by Ian McKellen and his daughter - Alberta Watson who have been brought along to try to shed some light on what is actually going on. Before long, a mysterious stranger played by Scott Glenn arrives at the Keep, with an in depth knowledge of the place and what lies within....
The film is superbly enhanced by an incredibly atmospheric score from those maestros of electronic music - Tangerine Dream.

My recommendation to anyone wishing to watch this film, is to read the book first because of its severely truncuated nature. That said scenes within the film do stand up well in their own right, and give us a glimpse of what may have been had Michael Mann been allowed to complete his vision. There are differing cuts of the film all over the world it would seem. Of the two UK releases on VHS, the first release - the 'Pre Cert' actually has more complete scenes than the stereo VHS that was to follow later. Various TV versions of the film across the globe appear to have additional scenes from time to time too. One piece of good news though is that Michael Mann and Paramount finally appear to have buried their differences, and may well be embarking on a Director's Cut of the film which we can only hope restores it as fully as possible to what it should have been firstly. Now that would be a truly worthwhile exercise.",1178236800,55,2832,4.572834645669292
246110,2,6300214346,"Caveat: I read and disliked the original novel which the film intended to follow closely.  That said, having sat through both, I can confidently say that the flick fails on its own merits, repeating (if not enhancing) flaws of the novel while succumbing to editing flubs.

THE PLOT: It's 1941, and Jurgen Prochnow is a Wehrmacht officer sent to garrison a remote Romanian village centered on an enigmatic fortress known as ""the Keep"".  The origins and purpose of the Keep are enigmatic, even to its caretakers.  Each brick is inlaid with a symbol slightly resembling a crucifix and - contrary to the basic rules of martial architecture - the Keep's structure is stronger on the inside than the outside, as if it were designed more as a prison than a fortress.  It isn't long before greedy Wehrmacht troops breach the structure of the Keep and release its sole inmate.  Able to kill at will, the malevolent being cannot escape the Keep itself - which is apparently a box-within-a-box.  However, there is the mysterious Glenn (Scott Glenn) who journeys across the Mediterranean once ""sensing"" that the Keep has been disturbed.  There is also Theodore Cuza (Ian Mckellan) who looks older here than he did in ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  Cuza, a scholar who's spent time studying the Keep, has been biding time a death camp when he's drafted by the Germans to explain the secrets of the Keep.  Cuza is accompanied by his strong-willed daughter Magda, and we soon sense that the two Cuzas will be locked in a battle paralleling that of the cosmic forces represented by Glenn and The Monster of the Keep.

WHY IT DON'T WORK:  The book has its fans, but I doubt that many will appreciate a film that sloppily carves up the story.  The nature and identity of ""The Monster"" and its shared origin with Glenn are never described - in contrast with the novel which DOES establish the two elements, then switches gears and adds new ones.  Instead ""The Keep"" never becomes more than a battle between Scott Glenn and some (nearly) invincible guy in a suit.  The flick hints at the conflict between Wehrmact Captain Woermann (always dependable Jurgen Prochnow) and SS Sturmbanfuhrer Kampffer (Gabriel Byrne in a surprising turn), even though both will eventually share a fate as fodder for The Beast.  Though the remaining story has less entertainment value than an hour-long episode of ""Twilight Zone"" (the `80's version at that), incoherent storytelling is bound to make the experience feel longer than its 2-hour running time.  In fact, there's little plot at all strung between the arrival of the Nazis and the confrontation between Beast and Glenn.  The flick botches novel's dilemma of whether the Beast is better or worse than the Nazis, or what it even is (readers of the novel, and maybe the flick's credits will know he's Molasar) and compliments that failure with visual effects that are sometimes intriguing but mostly laughably dated (animated lighting effects).

WHY IT MIGHT WORK:  The most recurring complaint is how the film botches re-telling of the novel, but those who haven't read it may appreciate the flick's atmospheric settings, score by Tangerine Dream and some bare attempt to keep up the suspense - even as the script utterly fails to gel into any story (whether faithful to the novel, or otherwise).  Instead, I'd suggest getting either John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" or ""Prince of Darkness"", or perhaps either version of ""Quatermass and the Pit"".",1161475200,,3456,4.913941480206541

The special effects are quite good for their day, particularly the smoke-collecting form of the demon.

Prochnow is convincing as the conscientious German soldier while Gabriel Byrne comes off a little clichy in his nazi-psychopath role, Ian Mckellan proves he can act and Scott Glenn is appropriately brooding and serious for the role of the mysterious stranger. I was pleased that the film took the effort to offer timeage to more complicated verbal exchanges between the characters on the nature of good and evil, so many horrors cannot spare any thought for anything other than gore and action nowadays.

From the beginning, Captain Klaus Woermann (Jurgen Prochnow) senses that there is something unusual about the keep. Looking as if it had just been built and inlaid with brass and nickel crosses in every corridor, crosses that the caretaker for the keep exhorts the Germans not to touch, the keep is an architectural oddity.

Soon the games begin, as an unseen force begins murdering his men. Captain Woermann sends a message to the high command. To his dismay, they respond by sending a Nazi squadron of einsatzkommandos under the leadership of SS Major Kaempffer (Gabriel Byrne) to quell whatever local guerilla activity is, undoubtedly, responsible for the murders. Soon, these death's head troopers begin succumbing to the same fate as their German Army counterparts, and all hell breaks loose.

Enter the ailing Dr. Theodore Cuza (Ian McKellen), a Romanian Jew and former professor  at the University of Bucharest. Although suffering from the ravages of some debilitating illness, he is ordered by the Nazis to the keep, as he is an expert in the history of the region. It is hoped that he will be able to shed some light on the mysterious keep and enable his hosts to defeat their unknown adversary.

Accompanied by Eva (Alberta Watson), his daughter, they find themselves confronted with the cruelty of the Nazis, the unexpected kindness of Captain Woermann, and something from their worst nightmares that has them call into question their deepest beliefs. Then, Glaeken (Scott Glenn), a mysterious red-headed stranger with piercing blue eyes also appears, and nothing is ever the same again.

While the novel, ""The Keep"", is one of the premier horror stories of all time, the film is almost laughable and far from being in the same league. Despite its stellar cast and a moody setting shrouded in mists,  the director seemingly opts to infuse the film with garish special effects that seem to have little connection with the book. Moreover, unless one has read the book and is able to fill in the gaps, the viewer may find the film to be almost incomprehensible. This is, I imagine, due to poor editing. The Tangerine Dream score is, at times, effective, but for a portion of the film it is simply jarring and seemingly out of sync with the mood of the film.

The evil at the heart of the keep departs from that in the novel. It has nothing to do with vampire folklore in the film. What was the screenplay writer thinking? Instead, the film has some special effects travesty, a mechanical demon with piercing , laser like red eyes. It is simply ludicrous, causing the movie to sink to a depth from which it simply cannot surface. Anyone who has read the book will be outraged by this transgression, as it serves to torpedo the film.

Our hero, Glaeken, arriving upon the scene on a motorcycle, has piercing blue eyes that can bend others to his will. He is also is armed with what appears to be a futuristic weapon that sends out death rays.  His steamy sex scene with Eva, after they have known each other for about two heartbeats, is simply ridiculous and appears to have been gratuitously thrown in. (Quick, the movie is almost over, and we need a sex scene. ) Other than he has red hair, piercing blue eyes, and can recover from what would otherwise be mortal wounds, the Glaeken of the film has little in common with the Glaeken of the book.

Still, the cast does the best it can with the hand it has been dealt. It is not, however, enough to save this film from the torpor to which it quickly sinks. Those of us who love the book would like to see a re-make that would make this wonderful book come to life. As this is the only film version now available, however, those who have read the book should rent this film, if only to see how it has fared.",1105920000,33,4564,4.607142857142857

246177,4,6300214346,"I REMEMBER SEEING ""THE KEEP"" FOR THE FIRST TIME ON CABLE, BACK WHEN ""HBO"" WAS STILL IN ITS INFANCY, AND IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. BEAUTIFUL, DREAMLIKE PHOTOGRAPHY, AN ODDLY EFFECTIVE SCORE, AND ABOVE ALL, A HIGHLY INTIMIDATING MONSTER WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A FANTASY/HORROR FLICK THAT IS TRULY UNIQUE. IN MY OPINION, HOWEVER, THIS MOVIE HAS CERTAIN FLAWS THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED:

  1.)EDITING: I MUST AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWERS WHO FIND THE EDITING TO BE HORRENDOUS, INDEED IT IS! AFTER WATCHING THIS FILM IN ITS ENTIRETY, I CAME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAD BEEN ""COMPRESSED FOR TIME AND CONTENT"", AS IF CLEANED UP FOR NETWORK TELEVISION. THIS CHOPPY TREATMENT OF WILSON'S NOVEL MOVES FAR TOO QUICKLY, RESULTING IN AN INCOHERENT PLOT AND CARDBOARD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING 2 OR 3 HOURS OF TEDIOUS HISTORY ON THE KEEP, MYSTERY IS A GOOD THING, BUT 15 ADDITIONAL MINUTES OF BACKGROUND WOULDN'T HAVE HURT THIS MOVIE IN THE LEAST. A FEW CREEPY NIGHTS IN THE CASTLE WITH A SLOW MOVING CAMERA WOULD HAVE HELPED TO ESTABLISH AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE BEGINNING, AS WELL.

  2.)ACTING: GABRIEL BYRNE AND JURGEN PROCHNOW BEHAVE AS IF THEY HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO, ALBERTA WATSON HAS ACTING CLASS IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, AND SCOTT GLEN'S CHARACTER IS INVISIBLE. AS THE MOVIE PROGRESSES, THE GROWING CONFLICT BETWEEN BYRNE AND PROCHNOW FEELS HOLLOW AND UNCONVINCING, AS IF BOTH ACTORS ARE WAITING TO HEAR ""CUT"" SO THEY CAN BURST INTO LAUGHTER. AS FOR GLEN AND WATSON, THE ROMANCE IS WORSE THAN A ""DAYS OF OUR LIVES"" EPISODE. I REALIZE THAT SCOTT GLEN IS A HANDSOME FELLOW, (MADE EVEN MORE SO BY THE STRIKING BLUE CONTACT LENSES HE IS WEARING), BUT NO MAN GETS LUCKY THAT FAST! ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WATSON'S CHARACTER WAS GANG RAPED BEFORE SHE MET GLEN. SEXUAL HEALING? MAYBE, BUT ITS STILL NOT VERY REALISTIC.

  3.) SPECIAL EFFECTS: ACCORDING TO F. PUAL WILSON'S NOVEL ""MOLASAR"" IS A VAMPIRE. IN THIS MOVIE, HOWEVER, HE FIRST RESEMBLES THE WORLD'S UGLIEST GENIE AND AS TIME GOES ON, HE DEVELOPS A MORE ""SOLID"" APPEARANCE. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE CARTOON SHOW ""TRANSFORMERS"" BACK IN THE 80'S, MOLASAR REMINDS ME OF A ""DECEPTICON"",(LARGE AND MECHANICAL LOOKING). I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH HIS LACK OF BRUTALITY. MOLASAR SEEMS TOO RESERVED FOR AN ""EVIL"" FORCE THAT HAS BEEN IMPRISIONED FOR SO LONG, AND THIS IS WHERE MICHAEL MANN FAILED TO EXPLOIT AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR VIOLENT AND TORTUROUS DEATH SCENES. NEVERTHELESS, I THINK HE'S A DAMN SIGHT SCARIER THAN ANY VAMPIRE I'VE EVER LAID EYES ON! SCOTT GLEN'S ""WEAPON"", FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM, IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST, MOST POWERFUL ROMAN CANDLE TOPPED OFF WITH A .79 CENT WAL-MART FLASHLIGHT. THE KEEP IS SUPPOSED TO BE A ""FANTASY"" MOVIE, SO HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE IMAGINATION IN WEAPONRY.

  ""THE KEEP"" IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF GREAT POTENTIAL THAT WAS NEVER GIVEN GREAT OPPORTUNITY. DESPITE ITS CONSIDERABLE FLAWS, IT IS STILL A VERY WATCHABLE AND ENTERTAINING FILM, IF ONLY FOR ITS MUSICAL AND CINEMATIC VIRTUES.",1095465600,3,3069,4.892100192678227
246178,4,6300214346,"No, don't get your hopes up. Paramount still han't put this out for DVD release in the United States, but ""The Keep"" is one of my cult favorite flicks and so I went to the ends of the Amazon to get an overseas copy viewable on Region 1 DVD.

After some dealing with an Amazon marketplace seller, I got a copy that was viewable on the second of two DVD players I tried. It is an extremely no-frills DVD to say the least, it has a menu with scene selection and, a, uh ""preview"" reel that shows some truly odd previews (""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"" and ""Barbarella"" for example....no, I'm not kidding, those are the previews). It doesn't pad any of the spots in the film which were obviously butchered by a ham-handed editor (like all of Scott Glenn's dialogue). No deleted scenes, no interviews, no nuthin'. So really the only benefit of having it is that the flick is on DVD and not VHS, and since the price was $40.00, you have to be a hardcore fan of the movie to go to the demented lengths I did to lay hands on it (I forgot to mention it is presented in widescreen, so that is also a bonus).

It had been years since I had seen this early Michael Mann film and indeed I wrote a review of the VHS version some years ago, but it was instantly recognizable as his work. His trademarks leap right out at you: the grim tone, the wonderful score (by Tangerine Dream and like the DVD, impossible to find anywhere, which is IMMNENSELY frustrating because not only is the music gorgeous, the band has made at least 7,373 albums, but they couldn't put out a soundtrack to this? GRRRRR), the cut-to-the-bone dialogue, the lush, sumptuous visuals. This film, like all Mann's works, is a visual feast: the black uniforms of the SS, the washed-out, coldly lit grays of the keep's interior, the horribly evil-looking demon, all beautiful). Unfortunately, it has the same flaws it had when it was released twenty years ago, and I can't get past them no matter how much I watch it (I keep looking for a ""Director's Cut"" that will flesh out the pruned-down characters of Eva and especially Glaeken...alas, none exists).

The big mistake of the film was the decision to make it primarily visual and reduce the characters of Glaeken and Molasar to simple icons, one representing good, one representing evil. Neither has more than a few words of dialogue; none of the rich subtexture of Glaeken's character, which a great actor like Scott Glenn could have handled easily, is shown. Nor is the necromancing Molasar shown as anything but an evil presence who wants out of his prison; his long violent history with Glenn, the deceptive games he plays with Dr. Cuza and the psych job he does on Woermann in the book, all of these are all whittled away, leaving only a big dude in a demon costume (nevertheless with some great lines, most especially his comeback to Gabriel Byrne: ""Where am I from? I am...from you."")

The movie does succeed with the characters of Cpt. Woermann, brilliantly played by Jurgen Prochnow, and Maj. Kaempfer, played with tremendously banal evil by Gabriel Byrne; their chemistry is excellent, and the scene where they tear into each other's beliefs at the end is a classic. Given fairly little, Alberta Watson and Ian McKellen both do a lot; it is mainly Scott Glenn who is left in the cold.

There is so much acting firepower in this movie (including veteran Robert Prosky and even wonderful Wolf Kahler in a minor role) and so much talent in the director Mann, it has such a great score and is shot so beautifully, and is predicated on such a great horror novel by F. Paul Wilson, I am continuously grieved by the fact it isn't a better movie. Just 15 minutes of dialogue would have saved the film from being a cult favorite instead of a horror classic; this is why I long for a director's cut. If enough of us beat the drums, it will happen; not even an outfit as stubborn as Paramount (look how they've done the fans of the Jason films)will turn down the chance to make more dough. So let's start beating.",1086566400,78,4025,4.5157750342935525
246179,1,6300214346,"I agree with those who say ""take it for what it is"", but disagree on the results you will get by turning off your brain to make an attempt at enjoying this. Obviously it's good guys and bad guys. DUH! But the devil is in the details.
The biggest travesty is the editting. There is a scene which begins with the old doctor creeping backwards through a hallway, as if he is hiding from something or running from someone. Suddenly he runs into ""the creature"" and chats with him a bit. Now, my question is: where was the doctor going? What was he doing in the hallway? Who did he think was following him? Unfortunately we'll never know.
And that's just one of many goofy, pointless scenes. Obviously we can ""assume"" things, but that's just our imagination filling in the numerous blanks that this film leaves us with. Why was the priest apparently sacrificing his dog? Why did the girl put out so easily and quickly for the stranger? Again, missing information that only our imaginations can redeem.
There is a HUGE difference between the questions this film leaves and those left by intelligent films. Good films don't tell you everything, but you know by instinct what happened based on the information at hand. The Keep leaves you guessing but doesn't supply the necessary tools to provide even the most instinctive answers to the questions it posits. You're left guessing because there's nothing to go on.
The acting is dry and lifeless, but that's not the fault of these otherwise decent actors. They simply weren't allowed the opportunity to shine because the script is so dull. If Ian McKellen couldn't make this film rise above lousy, what chance could it have had?

246180,5,6300214346,"The Keep is filmed in a beautiful style that increases the mysterious atmosphere of the story. It is set in a small Romanian village during WW II where a troop of Nazi soldiers are stationed in an ancient fortress called The Keep. It is carved into the base of a stone mountain at the entrance of the village. No one knows when The Keep was built or why. The large stones are strangely on the inside to imprison something in instead of protect against an outside threat. The commander, who provides a powerful and hypnotic performance, is unable to stop the unexplained murder of his troops each night. Writing appears on the walls of The Keep in a language that has been dead for over 500 years. An old and dying Jewish professor is brought in to decipher the ancient script. It becomes apparent to the professor that a strange and powerful being has been released and the professor must decide whether to join forces with it to destroy the Nazis or to resist it. The turning point occurs when the professor is commanded to sacrifice the thing he loves most in the world similar to God's command to Abraham to sacrifice his only son. The movie presents us with the question: can we always recognize evil and is it justified to unite with darkness to resist and fight against evil? What is the spiritual price each person must pay to survive in an immoral world?

246181,2,6300214346,"The Keep (Michael Mann, 1983)
Michael Mann has since directed Heat, Manhunter, and The Insider. Which makes you wonder what on earth he was thinking with The Keep. It's a frustrating film; the first half of it is very, very good, which makes the awfulness of the second half seems like it reaches epic proportions.
Based on the first novel in F. Paul Wilson's excellent Nightworld series of novels, The Keep follows a group of German soldiers during World War II, led by Klaus Woermann (Jurgen Prochnow, fresh off the Academy Award-winning Das Boot), who are sent to secure a Romanian keep with some strategic value...or so they're told. When they get there, they realize they're pretty much in the midst of nowhere. Woermann, the typical icy Nazi at first, softens gradually as he realizes they're in the middle of nowhere, even befriending (after a fashion) the place's caretaker, Alexandru (Morgan Sheppard, well-known videogame voice and recently onscreen in Gods and Generals). They encounter a problem, however; something starts killing off Woermann's troop, soldier by soldier. A detachment of the SS is sent in to investigate. The leader of the SS troop, Kaempffer (a very young Gabriel Byrne), is as displeased with the kinder, gentler Woermann as he is with the villagers (his first act is to have Amexandru and his two sons shot as an example), and Kaempffer and Woermann are immediately set up as enemies. The two and their troops, while inspecting the keep for insurgents, find some writing on one wall in a dead language; to translate it, they bring in a Jewish doctor suffering from a terrible disease, Theodor Cuza (Ian McKellen) and his daughter/caretaker, Eva (Alberta Watson, recently in The Sweet Hereafter). Which pretty much sets up the whole cast, except for Scott Glenn (who gets top billing), the Mysterious Stranger who's headed to the Keep for his own reasons.
All of this setup is accomplished over the first forty-five minutes of the film's hundred-minute length, and Mann does a fine job of creating tension while keeping the cheesy special effects to a minimum. (Astute viewers may note that some of the special effects in here were duplicated in Manhunter, but by that time Mann had learned a valuable lesson about overkill.) Once the special effects come trotting out, however, the movie goes downhill fast. It's as if Mann wanted to cram as many effects as possible into the last half of the film, throwing away the second half of the actual novel. The enmities he's already set up between Kaempffer and the other principal characters are carried through nicely, but otherwise, Mann is too busy throwing in some of the cheesiest special effects you'll ever see. (When the murderer is finally revealed without his halo of smoke, try not to laugh too hard.) Mann also glosses over a few important details that might have made the climax more lucid, for example what those ""crosses"" in the walls actually are. But by that time, the average viewer is likely not to care.
Recommended only for Michael Mann completists and fans of really bad horror films. Definitely to be avoided for fans of F. Paul Wilson's novel, who should have spent the last twenty years crying ""do-over!"" **",1071100800,5,3209,4.922509225092251
246182,2,6300214346,"How is it that regular folks like some of us could see some sort of art in this piece of cheese when the director himself is ashamed of this effort? How could we be more knowledgable about a film than it's director?
I hadn't seen this since about 1984 on cable tv (after reading the novel first) and remember disliking it immensely. Having just read the book a second time I felt I'd give the film a second chance and purchased it here, figuring that maybe since I was only in my early teens during my first viewing perhaps I needed to mature a bit more to be able to understand the film.
I was wrong.
Not only was the film STILL crap, it was even MORE crap this time around. Even as a huge fan of the book I still didn't understand what was happening in the film version!
The presence of some otherwise excellent actors--Scott Glenn, Gabriel Byrne, Ian McKellen--didn't help, because they had nothing to work with. There was NO character development at all, no real reason to feel any fear of Molasar (who, like Glenn's character, remained nameless throughout), and no real understanding of why the Germans would not leave the Keep.
The film's plot for the most part seemed to follow the general framework supplied by the novel. The series of events was similar, but the HANDLING of those events was ludicrous. Yes, the editting is unbelievably bad. So bad, in fact, that when many of the scenes begin you feel like you've missed about half of it already. Some extremely vital information seems to have landed on the cutting room floor.
The usually-great Ian McKellen is barely recognizable beneath his soulless acting, but he didn't have a decent screipt to go on so it's not his fault. Jurgen Prochnow only has one acting mode, so there you are. Gabriel Byrne was effective as a psycho Nazi, but not often seen. I didn't have much of a problem with Scott Glenn's portrayal of Glaeken, because he had a nice intensity that reflected the urgency of his mission, but his relationship with Magda--excuse me,I mean Eva (why the stupid name change for the film?)--blossomed waaaaayyyy too quickly.
We could go on forever about the film's flaws compared to the awesomeness of the novel, but even if we had no novel to compare this to it would still blow. Everything went wrong with it except for the soundtrack, according to some.
This is a perfect example of why it is best to just leave well-enough alone when it comes to adaptations. There was absolutely no reason why so many things needed to be altered (Dr. Cuza was referred to as ""Cuzar"" at times, but listed as ""Cuza"" in the credits)--the book was not a bestseller for nothing. It makes no sense to change what so many people thought was great to begin with.
Another case of ""Novel: superb,Film: garbage"".",1068249600,,2759,4.609756097560975
246183,3,6300214346,"The Keep is flat-out bizarre.  The movie absolutely reeks of the type of post-production tampering that renders ambitious sci fi and horror films incomprehensible.  Director Michael Mann, who has gone on to great things (Heat, The Insider), doesn't talk a whole lot about The Keep, and it has yet to be released properly to DVD despite the cult status.
The Keep is based on the excellent F. Paul Wilson novel that comes highly recommended.  Indeed, once you read the book you'll actually have a chance at figuring out what the heck is going on in the movie.
To sum up, during WWII a German army unit encounters an evil force while guarding a remote Romanian mountain village.  The Keep in question is a mysterious castle designed to keep something IN rather than out, and when the SS show up to find out why soldiers are being killed off, they unleash one pissed off movie monster complete with hoakey effects.
The novel is one of the best horror stories I've come across.  Drawing on history (WWII and the Nazis), it uses human drama to highlight the battle between good and evil, or light and darkness, all the while staying suspenseful and downright creepy.  Instead of treating all Germans as evil monsters, it draws careful distinction between a disillusioned army officer and his fanatical SS counterpart.
Unfortunately, The Keep is one of those movies that you really, really want to like but are forced to admit is just bad.  And, as one reviewer noted, once you get past that point you can enjoy it a bit.  The potential is astonishing: Michael Mann, a great source novel, great photography and a moody atmosphere, a Tangerine Dream score (famously never released and bootlegged and I might add, completely inappropriate in half the film), Jurgen Prochnow, Gabriel Byrne, Ian McKellen.  Yet, the whole thing falls apart in a hurry.  Things get downright mind-boggling by the end, when Scott Glenn (uh huh) uses something that resembles a cosmic bazooka to battle a demon that is equal parts smoke machine and glowing Casio readouts for eyes.  Ouch.
I value The Keep highly for its important bizarre movie value.  It looks great.  The opening is fantastic; a gray and rainy atmosphere surrounds the proceedings and it's appropriately bleak.  However, the plot gets out of control.  I must admit that it's a book and a story that could use a serious and capable remake.  Again, though, I have to note that some of the blame (indeed, much of the blame) can be attributed to what appears to be heavy doctoring of the entire film, making much of it impossible to understand.  A pity.
Nevertheless, put this thing on DVD!  Nothing is better than a bad movie WITH tons of extras to make you feel better about yourself.

The Keep is definitely worth a watch, however.

The problem is the editing; IT'S HORRIBLE!!! Be sure to have the rewind button handy, because you'll definitely miss some of the actors' mumbled dialogue.  Some scene editing and outtaking is laughable.  Example:  Scott Glenn and Alberta Watson do the wild thing only two minutes (movie time) after first meeting.  Hats off to the film for a scary monster (note that Molasar almost never shares a camera shot with another actor!) however.

I personally believe that the reviewer who said the special effects are laughable is being way too critical on a movie that is around two decades old.

246331,1,6300214346,"After Michael Mann's earlier (1981) success with ""Thief"", this low budget, overblown adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's gothic horror novel is a terrible disappointment. The action is set in Nazi-occupied Romania, during the Second World War. It is, however, clearly filmed in North Wales, with the disused slate quarries of Blaenau Ffestiniog doing a poor impersonation of the Carpathian Mountains. And with far too much dry ice compensating for the lack of any real atmosphere in the screenplay!
Of the cast, only Jurgen Prochnow's agonised performance, as the disillusioned and disaffected Nazi commander, is the slightest bit credible. Everyone else seems to be suffering from an overdose of intensity, something which is completely unwarranted, given the appalling script and the totally disjointed editing job to which the film has been subjected. The whole affair gives the impression that it has been strung together in a way that will link all of the (laughable) special effect scenes as economically as possible without once requiring the audience to engage any thought processes. No, not even Tangerine Dream's moody and brooding synthesiser soundtrack music can rescue this movie from a hellish pit of its own making - and where it really ought to be left, undisturbed.
Incidentally, if you're interested in acquiring the music from this film, you'll either have to fork out the absolute fortune that TDI want for the limited edition CD release, ""The Keep"", or else make do with the ten or so minutes-worth that were reworked into TD's live ""Logos"" album.

The mood is dark and the surrounding Keep itself lends to the effect that this is just not one place to hang out.

246413,2,6300214346,"When I stumbled across the description of this film a couple of years ago I was hooked...German troops sent to defend a Rumanian pass move into a castle/keep and are murdered one by one each night. The Waffen SS is sent to The Keep to find the killer and punish the villagers. I waited a long time to get a new copy and when I finaly did get one I was really let down, I did not know about the book that the film ws based on so I thought this was going to be a WW2 shoot-em-up, it's not. Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) plays the Wehrmacht officer in charge, Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata) plays the Waffen SS commander and Scott Glen (Urban Cowboy) plays some sort of angel who's destiny it is to fight the demon that is trying to escape from The Keep. Prochnow should have played the angel, his talent is wasted in the role he has in this film. Byrne and Glen offer solid if not wooden performances. Glen has one hot sex scene with the daughter of a Nazi prisoner, it's one of the few highlights of this film. The background music was done by the band Tangerine Dream and it is the very best thing this film has to offer, it is the only reason I gave this movie any stars. There is very little scenery for a movie set in the Rumanian mountains, you also never really get to see The Keep itself, only fleeting glimpses here and there which is disapointing. When two soldiers plundering release the Demon the stage is set and the killing starts. The Demon's appearance is really cheesy, the glowing red eyes look like something out of Superman or KISS Meets The Demon. Think of the scene in Raiders Of The Lost Ark when the Nazi archaeologist opens the Ark and releases the angels of vengence that kill all the Nazi's who gaze upon the Ark...The Keep was made 2 years AFTER Raiders but the special FX in the movie are worse than one from a film in the 60's! from a military standpoint it was a letdown, very little equipment, weapons or tactics to examine. If you like the plot of this movie as I did but want to see a good film try the VHS Castle Keep starring burt Lancaster in which a small American unit defends a castle in Belgium from the advancing Nazi's during the Battle Of The Bulge. The VHS The Bridge which is about Hitler Youth defending a bridge in their hometown from an American attack is also a good alternative. I don't even think fans of Goth will find The keep particularly entertaining, they should check out the 1999 Christopher Lambert movie Beowulf which delivers everything that The Keep does not.",988329600,,2511,4.356076759061834
246414,3,6300214346,"Given that there are 38 reviews of this film here at amazon.com, it amazes me that no one has pointed out an obvious possibility. Much like Ridley Scott's LEGEND, Mann's THE KEEP is a movie that obviously was butchered by the studio before theatrical release because the director did not have enough pull to have final cut. Why do I theorize this?
Both Mann and Scott are consummate story-tellers as directors. If you examine their other work, you can see that in evidence (even if you don't ""like"" the stories"" some of their films tell). For example, LAST OF THE MOHICANS and HEAT, for Mann. These are fully fleshed out stories that leave very few unanswered questions (except on purpose) and their narrative flow is even with no disjointed jumps in logic (prompting the viewer to think ""huh?"")
Yet in THE KEEP (as is the case also with Scott's LEGEND) not only are the respective films the shortest ever released by the director(s) (LEGEND is only 90 minutes!), but in each case, there are continuity errors, huge gaps of missing action, and even scenes that are so mis-cut and sloppily edited as to be incomprehensible. For example, the final battle scene in THE KEEP ends with Glaeken being sucked into the ""inner"" Keep but the scene is so poorly edited that instead, I thought, ""What the hell just happened?"" So much exposition, which is necessary, is missing from the film once Glaeken is introduced that it's a wonder anyone who didn't read the book had any idea who the heck he was! This film is from the same director who made HEAT? Hard to believe, isn't it?
I am convinced that THE KEEP, as it is now, is NOT the film that Michael Mann shot. Not even close. I would guess there are at least 20 to 30 minutes of expository and other footage laying around somewhere (again, just like with Scott's LEGEND). That there is buzz about LEGEND being released in a greatly expanded restored-footage DVD gives me hope that the same thing witll happen with THE KEEP.
All that being said, the film is very atmospheric, especially from the perspective of set design, lighting, and camera-placement (that famous long tracking pull-back shot when the soldier is first sucked into the ""crypt"" of Molasar was unbelievable when I saw it on the big screen, (without a VERY high-contrast TV, though, to accentuate the blackness of the crypt compared to the soldier's flashlight, the scene loses most of its power)). Tangerine Dream's score will not appeal to those who hate sequencers and synths, (I loved it) but it IS one of the most sought-after soundtracks, bar none, in history. For proof, visit ebay when a rare bootleg or the ""official"" verison goes up for sale. The last one fetched over $400!
Thanks for reading this long-winded take of mine.",982627200,14,2742,4.72651356993737
246415,4,6300214346,"In 1983, F. Paul Wilson's exceptionally well-written and horrific novel about a group of Nazis encountering time's first true vampiric evil was adapted into a film which flopped at the theaters, costing Paramount millions.  THE KEEP, starring Scott Glenn (Silence of the Lambs), Sir Ian McKellen (Lord of the Rings, The X-Men), and Jurgen Prochnow (Judge Dredd), was dismissed at the time by author Wilson as unrepresentative of his novel, while critics blamed director Michael Mann (Miami Vice, Heat) for the film's visual focus at the cost of a coherent storyline as well as perpetually mumbling actors.
However, the movie has since gained cult classic status due to its soundtrack.  Performed by new age gurus TANGERINE DREAM, the soundtrack of THE KEEP has never been released in its entirety.  On their concert album LOGOS, Tangerine Dream recorded a long segment which has elements from the movie score, while later in 1996 Tsunami Records produced an album by the Fantasy Merchants that contained inferior recreations of music from THE KEEP and other Tangerine Dream scores.  Bootlegs of the supposed true soundtrack to the movie appeared for years with unfamiliar music, but in 1999 Tangerine Dream put to rest the bootlegs with their for-charity-only  ""official"" release that contained only two pieces of music from the film compiled with unused studio test sessions.  Many believe that Tangerine Dream may have foolishly signed away their rights to the music to Paramount, or may not have actually done the music used in the final version of the film.  To date, the actual music used in the final version of the THE KEEP soundtrack has not been released, possibly due to legal problems unlikely to be resolved.
While the VHS videotape is periodically released for sale, fans of THE KEEP and Tangerine Dream await the eventual arrival of the movie on DVD -- THE KEEP is the only Michael Mann film not released as a special edition DVD.  It is hoped that such an edition would include an isolated music score and additional footage, especially the rarely seen second ending shown infrequently on television.",981504000,19,2115,5.057471264367816

Unfortunately, Mann relies more on the visuals than character development and plot. The result is an unforgivably abridged and signifigantly altered adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's wonderfully suspensful novel.

Of course, comparing the book to the film is comparing apples to oranges and somewhat unfair to both Mann and Wilson, but Mann loses all focus of the original story which centered on the origin of the Romanian vampire myth and the result is an incohesive mess. Many key plot elements are missing and the suspense that successfully manifested itself in the book and made you not want to put it down are skipped or altered entirely. It is unfortunate too because the elaborate sets and cinematography are outstanding and a fine cast with little room to perform or to deliver any sensible dialog. Gabriel Byrne's character as the loathsome S.S. commander is a guy that you just love to hate in the book, here is reduced to nothing more than a cardboard bully. Ian McKellan, a fine actor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apt-Pupil/dp/B002PUNOLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apt Pupil</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men-Blu-ray/dp/B001PPGAJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men [Blu-ray</a>]) is wasted as the Jewish Professor Cuza who discovers heretic literature and validates the traditional vampire myth in the book, even going so far to question his faith as a Jew and the validity of Christianity, is nothing more than a translator useful to just one scene in the film. The screenplay and editing are poor; one scene Dr. Cuza and his daughter Eva (Magda in the book) are having a conversation in a concentration camp and the next scene they are suddenly in Romania translating an ancient Slavic inscription on the wall of the Keep (written in blood in the book, but looks like it is written with a piece of chalk in the film) for the edification of the Nazi commanders. Even the mysterious stranger Glaeken (played by Scott Glenn) makes his journey to the Keep in just a few short scenes by way of motorcycle... a journey that takes him half the novel by boat, foot, and horseback to reach and furthering the suspense in the novel as the Nazis continue to die one each night by an unseen entity but only one death is actually shown before the S.S. and the Einsatzkommandos arrive at the Keep. The other deaths are merely spoken of in a single line of dialog and further denying the viewer the building suspense and mystery of the malevolent force inside the walls of the Keep. In the film, Molosar is revealed to look like some creature recycled from the old sixties Star Trek episodes, while the book is more subtle and leaving more to the imagination. The relationship between Glaeken and Eva blossoms in the book, but in the film they meet in one scene and in the next they are having sex?!?! And how is it that Eva seems to know his (unpronounceable) last name when there was no mention of it anywhere in the film anyway???

 While I absolutely love the premise of The Keep and regard it as brilliant storytelling, the film denies the viewer any chance to fully appreciate F. Paul Wilsons captivating book and experience the genuine suspense of the story. If you want moody music and eye candy to chew on, by all means watch the movie, but do yourself a favor and absolutely read the book.
