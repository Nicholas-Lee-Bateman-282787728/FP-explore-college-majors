These are somewhat different than later episodes in that the lodge members are more involved with the show and provide a background story for Handy-Man Corner and Adventures with Bill.  I love these and can't wait for the only missing part of the entire show to come out.",1271635200,,400,4.685714285714286

3993600,4,B002UXYCYU,Season 1 and 2 really just set the stage for the older more popular sesason.  thought i do like season 3 almost as much as say 5. Overall If you are a red green fan then how can you not have the first three sesons how it all begain.,1270339200,,232,3.7346938775510203

3993602,5,B002UXYCYU,"This is a 'MUSK' for Red Green fans who found the folly of Red only after the beginning of its 15-year run. 3 whole years of fruitcake entertainment from the creation of Steve Smith (Red Green) & Rick Green (Bill). 72 1/2-hr shows plus extras. If you're new to Red Green, this is the place to start, at the beginning.

See the boys of Possum Lodge almost yet in their pimpled puberty.
See the 1st Handy Man corner (Belt Sander) where Red ""would NOT recommend using it to sand your belt unless you're really into celibacy.""
See the 1st use of duct tape ""Handy Man's Secret Weapon"" ""Spare the duck tape-spoil the job.""
See the 1st moment of the phrase ""If women don't find ya handsome, they should at least find you handy.""
Hear Red explain nephew Harold (Pat McKenna) ""Uncles can't be choosers."" & ""Speaking of misconceptions, of which you are one.""

This set is the beginning of the hilarious dull-witted back-woods red-neck show that continued for 1 1/2 decades and accumulated a cult-like following equal to many rock stars.
Red sings: ""In the cool of the evening when the sun goes down,
That's when the bunch of us can be found
down by the campfire like so many elves
Sittin' here, standin' there, scratching ourselves.
Alone and all in a bunch
Be sure & wash your hands before lunch."" And then many more songs, at least one a show.

A book containing all of the Red Green songs and poetry would become a best-seller if ever put into print.

In year 2 (1992) more Possum Lodgers join the show...yeah, like more logic-challenged odd characters were needed. But they do add to the incredible absurdity. A red-neck camp of madness. So, so funny.  Character misfit mayhem at its best.

In year 3 we see Red's fuller, grayer beard, a live audience (which helped crank up the action and dysFUNctional behaviors. By this time the show has already achieved the ""Red Green Comedy Pinnacle Perfection"" of imagination and red-neck dummm-ness, classic craziness, Canadian calamity...Possum Do-Do.

Use the closed-caption option so you don't miss any of the fast dialogue. Jokes and gags often slip by faster than you can recover from another huge laugh or nose-sprayed emission of your favorite Red Green Show watching beverage.
OK, I have to admit, I'd rate ANY Red Green show DVD a 5-star comedy treat.

As Red Green said for 15 years, ""Keep your stick on the ice.""",1262908800,12,2358,4.6924939467312345
3993603,5,B002UXYCYU,"This is truly the Infantile years as Steve Smith develops his Red Green Persona. Reds voice is a lot lower & slower here and the show is still finding its way.  The formats change slightly but by year 3 they find their way with a new Canadian network at the helm.

This is not to say that these early shows are not fun, they are.  But you will see the show develop & progress as you enjoy their antics.

An all to brief Steve Smith introduction is repeated on disc 1 of all three years in this set, yes the very same introduction, and he states that the Canadian network was trying to make the show a sit-com in year two, but fortunately they dropped the show & a new Canadian network bought it allowing year 3 to develop into the show we know today.

But don't worry, even in these early years, the gang is here: Harold, Bill Smith, Ranger Gord, Hap Shaughnessy & others.  By year 3 Harold is running his own 'network' and there is a live audience. So sit back & enjoy the start of a 15 year run!

I should explain more about 'The Sit-com Year' year 2.  The entire half hour show is not a sit-com, you still have 'The Handyman Corner', 'Adventures With Bill', the Campfire Song and other bits.  But in this year there is an actual sketch with the boys of the club, often with Red & Harold taking the backseat to the other club members.  Bill is there, but in tradition of his adventures, he never talks.  The descriptions above for year two are the storylines of the sketches.  It is rather odd to see these segments, but don't worry they last only about 5 minutes.  Year 2 also has no live audience, the laughs are canned laughter.  Year 3 brings in the live laughter.

By the way, did you ever wonder just what that gadget is that Harold wears around his neck to control the effects of the show?  It is the control panel to an AMPEX 2"" video tape recorder (called a ""quad"" player because it used 4 heads to play out one picture), most of these were retired by TV stations in the 1980's when the smaller 1"" video tape format replaced it.

Overall this is a real treat for fans to see the rare early shows.
My only complaint is about the lack of substantial bonus material.  The old ""STUFFED & MOUNTED"" discs had much more to offer for insight. And why repeat the only short interview in all three sets?  Maybe Acorn intended at one time to sell these separately, but still couldn't Steve have shot three different introductions?  He had to spend the time getting into costume anyway!",1261785600,27,6697,4.283676703645008

3993606,5,B002UXYCYU,"If laughter is the best medicine (and it usually is; at least it makes me feel better than the other medicines I take), then this is the trauma center. The humor is very clever. I wonder if all Canadians have a great sense of humor. All I've met seem to.",1404777600,,254,4.1

3993609,3,B002UXYCYU,"So here is my review for this product, I LOVE Red Green, but I think its the later seasons I liked, I remember watching this on TV but it must have been in 96 or something, because I don't remember these first seasons. And I can't speak for everyone, but I did not care much for season 2, when they tried to turn the show into a sitcom. But it does pick up around season 3 from what I can tell, I like that. So I will be ordering the rest of the seasons, but this set gets a 3/5.",1398211200,,479,3.8

3993616,5,B002UXYCYU,"The laughs never cease, from the Possum Lodge to the elologically disastrous Possum Lake, to infernal relatives, the viewer is treated to fun! Say, aren't Red & Green the symbolic colors of something in our past? Might double entendre's be woven into the dialogues? See for yourself!",1354665600,,283,5.042553191489362
3993617,3,B002UXYCYU,"Don't start with this collection! The first season is ok but Red just describes events, the crazy contraptions he talks about aren't shown like in the later seasons.  If this is your introduction to Red green then buy one of the other collections first.  When you've run out of the others and are dying for more handyman corner or adventures with Bill then this will be worth buying.

The second season was forced into doing sit com scenes with new people who can't act and aren't funny.  Imagine redoing Mayberry RFD complete with a very bad imitation of Barney Fife.  New characters come & go nearly every episode because they are so bad.  The best part of these scenes is the fact that Red walks out in the middle of the 'action' in every episode.

Poor Steve Smith whose brilliant creation was hijacked in this season.  I recommend fast forward through the sit com stuff and just watch Bill and Red doing their very funny stuff.  The ending monologues are sometimes good too.  If you do watch these then here's a tip:  If it's Red alone or Red + Harold or Red + Bill or Red + Glen alone then it's funny.

Bill & Red are still hilarious (when Red shows you how to improvise a hammer what could be funnier?).  So these are worth seeing eventually but the other seasons are so much better you should start with them.  Steve hadn't quite got his game on compared to the later seasons and then they forced him into the sit com thing, luckily only for 1 season.  I bet he wanted to play dead for that entire season.",1341014400,2,1513,4.392086330935252

3993619,5,B002UXYCYU,"This is hard ro describe.  While the genre 'could' be slapstick, the delivery is serious and sometimes VERY subtle (the winter of our discount tent. . . )",1307318400,,154,4.5
3993620,5,B002UXYCYU,"My husband and I have been Big Red Green fans for many years.  We have developed an appreciation and even an affection for the usually quirky residents of Possom Lake, and especially Possom Lodge.  I recently purchased some DVDs titled ""Red Green, the Infantile years."" It has been fascinating to see the changes that have taken place since its inception. I will definately be purchasing ""Red Green, the Toddlin' Years"" next.  We enjoy the quirky humor of men behaving like men.......badly.  My favorite parts are usually Ranger Gord and seeing what Red can do to a K car. Hysterical!",1299888000,,584,4.8686868686868685

3993624,5,B002UXYCYU,"Who doesn't love Red Green!?!  Having purchased other DVD's from later years I can definitely see a dramatic difference between the early shows (the 1991 & 1992-however, there were some pretty funny moments-especially Adventures with Bill)but 1993 was by far the best of the three.  Maybe having a live audience had something to do with it and also having more freedom to do what they wanted to do.  The second season(1992)was portrayed like a sitcom and just didn't work.  I would recommend this set for anyone who is a fan of the show.  Are there people who aren't!?!  I have looked for the years 1994,'95 and '96 and can't seem to find them--I'll just keep looking.",1278979200,2,668,4.7155172413793105

Season 2 is painful to watch.
The acting is terrible.  The stories weak.  The casting poor.
The network went politically correct and created a ""diverse"" cast that is very disappointing.
This is your warning.  Steve Smith himself warned me and boy was he right.
Steve Smith says that if you can stomach the main show the ""Adventures with Bill"" segments are pretty good.
On the other hand, I'm really glad he didn't give up (or give in to PC) and got the show back in season 3.
