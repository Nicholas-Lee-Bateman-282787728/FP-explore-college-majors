Addenda: as of 7/2016, this problem has been corrected and I enjoy this production.  The passage of years only makes it better.",1265414400,4,288,4.795918367346939
1224429,4,B00000INHJ,"I have bought this DVD with great expectations but besides the first act I could not hear anything because a constant vibration noise continued throught all opera! The second, third and fourth acts are inaudible and invisible also. I thought that mine was only a faulty DVD but when I saw others complaining about the SAME thing I discovered that the blame must fall on the DECCA records!!! The public demands a new DVD with quality remastering, not this unworthy exemple of a job badly done by the record company. Mr Pavarotti and the other singers deserve better! WE THE PUBLIC DEMAND A NEW REMASTERING OF THIS OPERA FROM DECCA!!!D

1224432,5,B00000INHJ,"I was thrilled to be able to view this opera on DVD.  I have been a fan of the Met since the early 70's when I used to listen to the Saturday afternoon live performances.  I was very blessed to be able to attend live performances in New York in the mid-70's, and once I attended a performance of the Met on tour in DC when I lived there.

I love all of these singers.  By watching it, I felt like I had gone home to my younger self and to a simpler time, when a hotel room right across the street from the Met could be had for $25 a night! and a ticket to the opera cost $7!! Granted it was the last balcony, but that's ok, it was closer to Heaven up there! and the golden voices filled the whole theater even if the people on the stage looked so tiny...",1208649600,3,754,3.8766233766233764
1224433,3,B00000INHJ,"I have been looking forward for this DVD. I had the VHS for years, so the performance is a delight to me. But I was disappointed as I received a defective DVD. I returned it and the replacement had the same defect. It would not play after the first act. Amazon has been very decent about it but I am disappointment as I had to ask for a refund. Has anyone else had this problem? I am going to wait a while and then try again.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verdi-Ernani-1983/dp/B000VLYIW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verdi: Ernani (1983)</a>",1204848000,15,578,5.362637362637362
1224434,5,B00000INHJ,"I just love early Verdi. It's the raw energy he posseses. And it is above all found in Ernani which I have always loved - looking back to the records of Bergonzi, Price and Shippers. But this MET version is superb. Pav is still a singer rather than a fat ego. I've always loved Mitchell. then there are Milnes and Raimondi in their prime. Lots of high notes all around esp from Pav and Leona. And the young Levine was very good with early Verdi. Some called him brash but that's what Verdi needs here. Bernard Shaw wrote,  ""this is the most intense ensemble opera written before Trovatore."" And Trovatore was the last of these raw energy operas. Verdi may have matured, and honed his craft in excelsis  but I shall always cherish these raw stand and deliver scores. Without them he could never have pulled off Otello.",1202083200,2,817,4.513513513513513
1224435,5,B00000INHJ,"This rarely-performed Verdi's earlier opera contains some very nice music. Although Pavarotti and Mitchell seem very good in the performance, I still prefer Domingo and Freni from La Scala performance. Overall, this is a good addition to your opera DVD collection anyhow.",1199664000,2,271,5.476190476190476
1224436,5,B00000INHJ,"I had the privilege to see this production in person and I must say that the DVD captures the essence of the production.

Lucianno brought his usual beauty of voice to this production as well as Leona Mitchell.  We have not heard near enough from her.  But what a singer she is.  She scaled this piece with soaring beauty and bravura,  scaling over orchestra and chorus with unusual beauty and technique.

Sherill is in magnificent voice and verile in his portrayal.  Raimoindi rounds out these great voices as a robust and earthy Bass.

It was a delight to hear Verdi's music essayed in this way.

I beg to differ about Freni's portryal over Mitchell's. Mitchell

has the depth and expansiveness, not to mention the beauty that it takes to sing Verdi.",1168560000,4,752,4.67175572519084
1224437,4,B00000INHJ,"James Levine and his met forces offer us a performancer of 'Ernani' that includes revisions Verdi made to the score after its Venice premiere. He added a cabaletta to Silva's aria that was taken from an alternative aria he wrote for his first opera 'Oberto'. The bass part of Silva was considered a secondary role because his aria had no cabaletta. Consequently star basses used to have the baritone role of Don Carlo transposed to bass register. Verdi inserted the cabaletta into the opera to discourage the practice. Furthermore in Act II Verdi wrote a new aria to act as finale to the Act. This was done at the behest of Rossini who wanted a bravura aria to showcase the talent of his protege Nicolai Ivanov. Both Ruggero Raimondi as Silva and Luciano Pavarotti as Ernani justify their inclusion in this performance. Elsewhere in the performance Pavarotti sings with  lovely melting tone and Raimondi strikes one as an utterly driven Silva. Leona Mitchell as Elvira sings securely as Elvira even if she is not as dramatically compelling as Mirella Freni for Riccardo Muti in La Scala. Similarly Sherrill Milnes yields dramatic points to the incomparable Renato Bruson, yet delights by his firm top notes and ease with which he sings his music. By virtue of the variants described above this performance should be seen as a supplement to instead of an alternative to the Muti performance",1118102400,23,1389,4.885593220338983
1224468,5,B00000INHJ,"First I think It has to be said that Ernani is not an overly believable story.  The sheer melodramatic unlikeliness of some of the action make it less of a sheer dramatic experience, unlike say, Rigoletto, Otello, La Traviata, or many of Verdi's later works.  This is not a reflection on Verdi, who uses this mediocre Libretto to create some very moving music.

  As I said in the title, this singers are nearly ideal.  Pavarotti plays the bandit Ernani.  He has rarely sounded better.  His tone is Bright, attractive and ringing,  This first act aria, despite a small rhymical mistake at the end, is fabulous.  He takes an optional aria, that I had never heard before and sings it virtuosically.  His acting is general, but he looks very good onstage.  I was not dissapointed by his acting.  I believe this is because the Liberetto does not make intricate dramatic demands on the singer, so general melodramatic emotion passes as appropriate.

  Leona Mitchell is an excellent Elvira.  It is a part that has alot of chest voice required, and Leona brings it.  She sings Ernani Involami, with ardor and passion.  The costumer might have mae a more intelligent choice so that the Diva's chest didn't heave out of her shirt with every breath, it wasn't exactly becoming.

  Ruggero Raimondi was intense as Silva.  He was believable as the cucolded old man.  his voice was booming and edgy. While his voice isn't always focused perfectly, he is a perfect dramatist.  His performance is wonderful.

  Sherill Milnes is a great Charles the 5th.  It is of interest that this performance was Milnes's comeback from vocal sugery after busting a cappilary in his vocal cord.  He kept it a secret and cancelled many performance, including the Met centennial gala.  His anxiety over this performance, by his own admission, approached hysteria.  Miraculously, he sings very well here.  Perhaps his voice is a bit under, but its still has the Milnes coloring.  His aria comparing himself to Charlemagne, was a classic.  Throwing caution to the wind, he muscles out a A flat, to the delight of the crowd.

  Overall this is an excellent production of verdis opera.  If you are an early verdi fan, this is a must have.",1111795200,14,2203,4.804289544235925
1224469,5,B00000INHJ,"This is a historical performance. For the first time in over 100 years,the alternate finale of Act 2 is being played in a major opera house,Pavarotti receiving a well deserved ovation after the aria and cabaletta wrote by Verdi for his famous contemporary tenor, Ivanov. Mitchell and Raimondi are in superb voice, both very secure with the exposed high notes from the score. As it was only later known, this is the first performance of Milnes after his vocal chords surgery. Altough he takes a little time to warm up, he manages afterwards to bring down the house in style, with a fantastic A-flat at the end of his big aria. Levine conducts with style the orchestra and chorus,in a performance staged during the Met centenial celebrations.",1094860800,16,740,4.834645669291339
1224470,1,B00000INHJ,"I wonder if those who are enthusiastic about this performance have seen the Muti/La Scala performance with Domingo, Freni, Bruson, and Ghiarov?  That one is fiery and exciting. I found this production plodding.  Of course, Pavarotti sings well, but Leona Mitchell does not have the flexibility in her voice to sing the role well.  I recommend waiting for the La Scala production - with all 4 singers and Muti in superb form, though the sets are sometimes ludicrous.",1038096000,18,465,4.935897435897436
1224471,5,B00000INHJ,"This is majestic performance. Everyone here on his or her best. Pavarotti is glorious and really tragic as Ernani. I know, I'm not original here: I like Pavarotti.  Milnes makes unforgettable Carlo. Silva presented by Raimondi is fabulous. Mitchell makes outstanding Leonora. Honestly, this production is something of opera's best life recorded performances that I ever saw. Levine direction is perfect. He gives the voices pop up and sound on their best. This one is whole pleasure to listen.
One more word to say about the chorus: it is one of the unforgettable. I really think that this production is one to the treasure.",1032739200,9,624,5.0
1224472,5,B00000INHJ,"The review is based on Pioneer DVD copy, serial number PC-99-102-D. God, fine, brilliant 1983 years performance from Met. All these kind of words you can decide to this cast. Definitely, it is difficult for all tenors to be in excellent shape just in first act, when tenor has big aria and scenes (the same experienced Gino Penno in live Cetra recording), but Pavarotti is better in second act with traditionally omitted aria after well-known duet with de Silva (this aria is recorded in studio by Pavarotti with Claudio Abbado on CBS label), but there is no way to hear cabaletta with chorus after aria in II act (at least I have never heard this piece!!!). And he is excellent in last final trio. Raimondi is fine de Silva, absolutely different interpretation and sonically may be much less impressive then Christoff classic performance, but with his play it become captivate. Milnes is not in top vocal shape, however he gives a very solid face of King Carlo, it is worth to listen and watch him. Although Leona Mitchell (Leonora) is bad prototype of Leontine Price, she doesn't spoil the cast. Tempos are fast, however under the sensitive and right James Levine reading everything seems beautiful. And we need to mention maestro Verdi's deep both musical and theatre talent, fully revealed him in this opera. Not in vain famous German film director and big music lover Werner Herzog used final trio in his best and great film `Fitzcarraldo'(1982) with fantastic Klaus Kinski in title role.
Finally, I have to say a couple words about technical details of the copy, sound is terrific - beautifully recorder, as studio audio recording, picture is clear, as it should be, unlike Kultur Film (see my review of Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia on DVD) copies.
There is no way do not recommend this full version (more longer than Schippers version on RCA studio recording) of the opera performance. If you buy you will definitely love it.",1030233600,9,1931,4.872340425531915
1224473,5,B00000INHJ,"Pavarotti no es el &uacute;nico que impresiona en esta magn&iacute;fica edici&oacute;n. &Eacute;l comparte su nivel por lo menos con tres cantantes m&aacute;s de primer orden. Los coros son impresionantes, lo mismo que las arias. Normalmente, destacamos primero la m&uacute;sica, el canto, la orquesta, el, valet, el vestuario de una &oacute;pera y quiz&aacute; al final el argumento. En Ernani podr&iacute;amos invertir el orden. Un argumento tan profundo como la m&uacute;sica. No es un drama de pretexto para llorar. Ernani lleva a reflexionar, incluso con j&oacute;venes, sobre aquella pugna interminable entre disfrutar las oportunidades hoy o pagar una promesa con la vida. La trama queda en la mente como un interrogante de mucha actualidad y la m&uacute;sica como una melod&iacute;a que no se puede olvidar. A quienes nos afect&oacute; la conquista espa&ntilde;ola de Am&eacute;rica, podemos apreciar la vida en Europa en ese entonces. Alianzas y lealtades del viejo mundo.",1020038400,3,981,5.680272108843537
1224474,5,B00000INHJ,A terrific performance!  I have never had the opertunity to see this opera.  The DVD was a good way to see it.,975110400,2,110,3.9545454545454546
1224475,4,B00000INHJ,"I have to confess that until my wife bought this DVD for my birthday I had never heard a complete version of Ernani.  It is certainly an excellent  example from his ""Galley years"" of things to come.  Am I alone in  sometimes thinking I had strayed into Il Trovatore? The title role suits  Pavarotti's voice perfectly and he gives us a display of his usual vocal  splendour and exemplary breath control and diction.  What a star he is, if  any one from the Met reads this then please release both of his Met relays  of ""Ballo"" on DVD as soon as possible.  However, it would have  been the icing on the cake if he had attempted to act a little more.  Still  I suppose you can't have everything.  Although, look at his first Ballo on  VHS; that will scotch all rumours that he can't act. I realise that Leona  Mitchell is revered in NY, and her portrayal of Lui and Michaela at the Met  are very good - but she is totally miscast here.  The role stretches her to  the limit and reveals some very unpleasant vocal lines - showing up a major  defficiency in her technique.  I am afraid that she is the weak link in  this production, a view apparently not shared by the audience who go wild  for her.  I am afraid to say that she does nothing for me. Everyone else is  superb - and Levine takes charge with his usual verve - making this a very  enjoyable and exciting night at the opera.",964137600,19,1381,4.255813953488372
1224476,5,B00000INHJ,"Anyone who hasn't heard the previous VHS version of this performance has missed a whole lot of just about everything great there is to be heard in this or any medium. The dvd just enhances what is already a superb  performance even if the production is somewhat claroscuro. The Met likes  Verdi in the dark as witnessed by the present Il Trovatore production. Buy  it, cherish it and revel in its vocal splendor. Levine does wonders with  the Met orchestra.",950659200,12,457,4.675
1224477,5,B00000INHJ,"George Bernard Shaw described Ernani as Verdi's most intense opera, and in this rendition, all of the musical and visual elements of the work that so pleased the irascible Shaw come together marvelously. Who better to conduct  it than James Levine, today's best interpreter of Verdi, and considered by  many to be the heir to Toscanini. Young and still vocally secure, Pavarotti  sings with boldness and color, with few of the extra syllables which mar so  much of his middle years. Milnes, in the manner of Leonard Warren, is  perfect in the role of Carlo and Leona Mitchell, while not quite the  Verdian as Leontyne Price, fully realizes her part. Considering that this  is a 1983 recording, this DVD shows how well the medium captures both the  visual and musical elements of opera in general and Ernani in particular. A  standing ovation for such a grand performance of a grand opera! And by the  way, for folks who think that Verdi didn't hit his stride until Rigoletto,  here is the proof of how truly great his earlier works are.

Added 5/22/13: The original review was based on the Pioneer Classics disc, which has been re-mastered by Decca. Despite a run of defective discs mentioned by several reviewers, I just ""upgraded"" to the Decca version and am delighted with the improved picture and the DTS surround option. It made a big difference and it played without difficulty.",949968000,65,1384,4.817796610169491

Pavarotti was in his best voice.  Leona Mitchell was in her velvety best voice.  Even Sherrill Milnes was in his best voice.  Only Ruggero Raimondi's voice showed a little age, but that was actually in keeping with his character as an old man.  Why this tuneful opera is performed so infrequently is beyond me.",1494633600,,461,4.481927710843373

7910954,5,B00000INHJ,"Said the reviewer of the NY Times in 1983, when the Mets new production, recorded on this disc, opened:
Published: November 20, 1983
''Ernani'' is an important opera because it is by Giuseppi Verdi. Other than that, its attractions are modest. It is, in fact, third-rate Verdi, which makes it second-rate anyone else, or better.(By DONAL HENAHAN).
That,  I take it, reflects the view of a sophisticated student of the voice and of opera. I am neither. I am just a guy who listens and watches...with no understanding of how anyone can make such wonderful sounds or how they compare with others who took the role forty years before or lately in Milan or Paris. From my limited viewpoint only, seeing the opera tonight was a 'grand' (mild pun intentional) experience. Sure the story leave something to be desired, is that really what the average viewer cares about? I took it in stride. What mattered was listening to four voices in a situation which gave us plenty of opportunity to hear them belt it out in different moods with background, costumes, scenery and pacing which allowed each to show what he/she/they could do. I don't know a chest tone from a stomach tone or a nasal tone.....but I very much liked what each of them did. Milnes and Pavarotti, top of the line talent, Raimondi as solid as a rock, experienced bass, and the relative newcomer, Mitchell (who, in response to one review here, did end up with 12 seasons at the Met) who earned her way into a regular berth, put together made it a very good evening of song. Speaking, therefore, only to the people who may not know why they like what they hear or how it was made to happen, this is a good disc to have at home to play whenever you need to hear a good evening of song with a modest but appealing drama.",1451001600,7,1773,4.5233644859813085
7910955,5,B00000INHJ,The best!,1429920000,,9,4.0
7910956,4,B00000INHJ,"Both the chorus and Pav sound stanco for the first scene, and with that limp decrescendo ending to the first aria, it's underwhelming. Levine allows far less of the indulgent rubato in the cabaletta than you usually get, which is nice and an indicator that he was not going to let things drag that evening.
Things start to look up when Miss Mitchell arrives; she sounds great and looks beautiful even if not particularly emotionally involved. 'Ernani involami' is taken at a sprightly tempo, but Levine shows himself to be the consummate accompanist in the cabaletta, with her at every step of the way. And a good thing too since she has to interrupt the line to take so many breaths-- seriously, a lot of them. But she hits all the notes and they're all big and in tune, which is more than you can say for lots of Elviras; and she sings the coloratura accurately and in tempo without ever sounding like she's frighteningly close to grief, which is more than you can say for most Elviras. Seriously, that thing is impossible, and the coloratura often turns into a embarrassing spectacle for everyone in attendance. And without resorting to tricks (like singing the notes staccato) or overly cautious marking, Mitchell does good work.
Milnes does his thing, and helps get the fire started under everyone else. Covered as hell, but at least at this point, the higher notes (of which he had many loud and long ones to share with us that evening) aren't flattened by this technique. By the time Pav is back out for his duet and act ending solo, he seems inspired and you think, ah he brought his voice with him. Some real frisson, and the bravos are earned. The Ah sommo Carlo finale gets the blood flowing, and Levine doesn't overinflate it too much (until the final cadence-- I like Abbado's approach to these things where the final BUM-BUM....BUM BUMMMMs aren't. all. marcato. and. overly. em. pha. sizeeeeeeeeeeeeed.
I wanted a little more volume from the soloists at that point, but it's a live performance with one scene left to go and experienced boys and girls know not to blow it out in the ensembles.
Pav and Mitchell have plenty of gas left in the tank for the last scene; she seems to have her breath under better control and is move involved dramatically. And those parts of the music where we get the sudden swell of Verdi Rapture are handled beautifully by Levine.
It all seems like a very Levine Met kind of show, conservative musically and visually, which seemed kind of typical back in those days, but we didn't know to appreciate while we had it.",1372723200,,2561,4.643171806167401
7910957,5,B00000INHJ,"I have nothing to add to the five-star reviews; I agree with them.  I am posting this review solely to say that the DVD I received from Amazon.com is not defective in picture or sound (though I had to reset the Italian subtitles at the beginning of each act, no big deal).

My copy is from Amazon.com, not an Amazon Marketplace supplier.  I do not know if that makes a difference.  Note also that another reviewer bought her copy in 2012, and it was not defective either.",1358294400,,471,4.379310344827586

Needless to say I happen to love Verdi and am very glad I purchased this DVD to add to my extended opera collection.  Anybody of the opinion that Pavarotti never acted (or couldn't act) ...  Take another look !  Mr. Milnes is in excellent form.  And I regret that Ms. Mitchell sort of disappeared from the opera stage.  She is a wonderful Elvira.
I did notice some reviewers had a DVD that didn't want to play through.  I thought of that before ordering and gave it a try.  Luckily my DVD posed no problems.",1334966400,2,610,4.414414414414415

Had my order with Newbury_comics [marketplace]. First copy would not play past 1st act. Short email from me and a second one was on its way [didn't have to return the first one]. Second one was faulty as well! The seller took a week and got a playable copy [they opened and tried it with my approval]. Customer service was exemplary and now I have a good copy - it totally worth it!

As to this production of Ernani - there are only two DVD productions worth your while in the market: this one and La Scala's with Domingo - they are both great but not perfect - if you love Ernani or just Verdi - get both!. If I had to choose only one [I own now both], I would go with this one, but this is a close call and very much a matter of taste.",1269129600,3,888,3.9887640449438204
7910960,5,B00000INHJ,"Thrilling singing from beginning to end--so much better than the Muti/La Scala DVD in which almost all singers are over-parted, even Domingo. Pavarotti is effortless (and he's absolutely adorable in curtain calls) and even if Mitchell does not come up to the CD of Price she has a warm and full voice which the likes of Freni cannot equal.  The sets may be overdone (but at least they are not confusing as at La Scala) and Levine's conducting is incisive and finally winning.  But I have also only watched the earlier Pioneer release of this performance so do not know about possible defects in the newer version.",1267056000,,613,4.719626168224299
