831222,1,6304291744,I love Leslie Sansone but this DVD is bad!! It has little warm up time and that may lead to injury. Make sure to do lots of warm up on your own before starting with the work out. Be careful with the floor excercises if you're a beginner.,1140652800,23,237,3.9583333333333335
831223,5,6304291744,"The title is a little misleading--I thought this was a walk CD, when it's actually upper and lower body work.  But it's a great workout.",1140652800,20,136,4.44
831224,4,6304291744,"Although you may need additional warm-up and cool down time, if you're new to the workout scene, this is the video to get. Leslie shows the most effective, efficient and time-tested ways to tighten and tone our major muscle groups. Her team consists of women of different sizes and ages which can be quite beneficial to all users. Her demeanor is friendly and upbeat, yet no nonsense and her form is perfect. This video is definately a must-have for beginners.",1127433600,26,460,4.7625
831225,5,6304291744,"I currently own several of Leslie's DVDs, so I may be biased, but I've also seen my share of firming workouts from others and this is by far the best, in my opinion.

This DVD offers 3 different ability levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) so even after you build up your stamina, the DVD doesn't become obsolete.  And even once you reach and surpass the advanced level, you can easily add ankle/wrist weights for even more challenge.  It's truly a DVD that grows with you - worth the money!

There is a short warm up at the beginning and stretch at the end, but I always do this DVD after her Walk Away the Pounds 3 mile DVD, so I'm already well warmed up by then.

Great attention is given to the arms, thighs, butt and abs (both upper, lower & obliques), while no specific exercise is given for calves (but again, I use these after her walks, so I'm not worried about working out the calves).

Overall, I couldn't recommend it enough.  It can be easily tweaked for your personal workout if needed and offers great results.",1124841600,44,1030,4.475935828877005
831226,4,6304291744,I enjoyed this tape.. I have used it once and will definetly be using it again.. After finishing the tape. my thighs were so sore for 2 days.. very good work out.. learned some new exercises that I haven't done before..I will be using this one often.. I would recommend this video to anyone..,1105574400,19,292,4.425925925925926
831227,3,6304291744,"This is the 4th Leslie Sansone tape I've bought.  Together with the '2-mile walk', it makes a decent 1 hour workout.  This tape has some of the same participants of '2-mile walk' and, like that video, has the  participants working at different levels.  This tape is more no-nonsense  than her other tapes in that she doesn't interact at all with the  participants.
There are good exercises for thighs, hips, arms, and abs,  but little for shoulders, calves, and back.  Form is stressed throughout  the video, but bad form is used for some of the ab exercises.  The  participants sometimes show appallingly bad form, which may be confusing to  a beginner.
The warm-up is inadequate and the stretching is almost  nonexistent in this video, so be prepared to do these on your own.",963964800,62,777,4.795454545454546
831228,5,6304291744,"IT'S GREAT!  I have ""wasted"" money on other exercise videos and am SO GLAD I found Leslie! The exercises are interesting and she actually knows how to count (haha). The girls that are on the video with  her are average run-of-the-mill girls so you don't feel like you'll never  be ""like them"". I have the In Home Walking video of hers and  alternate with the Firm up Fast. I just ordered four more Leslie tapes.  I'll never waste money on another so called Exercise Queen again. Leslie,  Leslie, Leslie, she's great!
She makes exercise fun. No more ""CAN'T  KEEP UP OR FOLLOW"" dance stuff. Let's Walk With Leslie!",943833600,89,612,4.611111111111111

7866998,5,6304291744,"As usual Leslie gives a great workout. This was when she was younger, but is still a good one and gives a variety to her later one's.",1368921600,,133,3.962962962962963
7866999,5,6304291744,"I rented this DVD from our public library to preview before I purchased it. This  DVD is a little older, but the exercises Leslie has chosen are definitely effective. The pace is a slower than some of the DVD's targeted toward intermediate and advanced fitness enthusiasts. Throughout the DVD, Leslie instructs calmly, and encourages you every step of the way. Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of the same exercises are demonstrated, so you pick the one you want to do. This DVD is one you can grow with.  It is one of my favorites for a solid, no-nonsense  strength workout.",1320451200,2,586,4.84

7867001,2,6304291744,"WEll I was very disappointed when I got this. There is no walking involved at all. It is just a bunch of toning exercises. I am not sure when it was filmed, but the workoutwear is very early 90's ish and Leslie talks about just having her son recently. Don't buy this if you are wanting a walking workout because there is no walking in it like the other workouts.",1202428800,2,363,4.2
7867002,2,6304291744,"I love Leslie and feel I owe my current hot bod to her Walk Away the Mile DVD's...1, 2 and 3 miles.  But this one I feel a little duped.  It is very outdated and must have been done in the early 90's.  However the packaging says something like 2004....",1193443200,2,252,4.0
7867003,5,6304291744,"I just love Leslie Sansone.  I discovered her Walk Away the Pounds walking DVD and have lost weight and inches.  I wanted something to help firm up my legs and abs...I have only been doing this DVD twice a week for about 3 weeks and I can already see my abs firming up.  I would recommend this DVD.  She uses slow movements to get the most benefit from the workout.  I just love it and Leslie Sansone.  ANd unlike other workouts I have done, I do not feel rung out after working out with Leslie.",1182816000,5,495,4.157894736842105
7867004,5,6304291744,"Leslie Sansone's Firm Up Fast Walk begins with a short walking warm-up and then moves quickly into an invigorating series of standing exercises that focus on the thighs and arms. The routine then moves into a mat workout where you test your endurance with leg lifts to workout the inner and outer thighs.

Leslie's teaching style is very professional and she keeps you on track with precise movements to encourage faster results in the least amount of time. Overall, this is an excellent workout with adequate warm-up time if you are used to working out or lead a fairly active lifestyle or you have been walking around during the day. If you go right into this workout from sitting at the computer, you may want to do 10 minutes of walking or just start walking while Leslie talks you through the first section of the explanations. What I like most about this DVD is the fact that Leslie keeps you focused and also gives you enough repetitions to really workout your abs, thighs and arms. Instead of just walking, you are using weights and your own body weight to increase muscle tone and that helps you burn more calories over time.

If you enjoy this workout, you may want to look into the Leslie Sansone ""You Can Do"" Yoga, Pilates and Abs workouts. I think you will enjoy her teaching style on all of these DVDs. If you are new to Leslie's workouts, she has them set up so you can start at 1 mile and work your way to a 4-mile challenge. I think you will also like:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-Away-the-Pounds-Leslie-Sansone/dp/B0007Z0OFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk Away the Pounds - Leslie Sansone</a>
