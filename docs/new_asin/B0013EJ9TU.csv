3105369,5,B0013EJ9TU,"Reality UFO Series 1 is a fascinating compilation of four lectures from the 2003 ""International Scientific and Metaphysical Symposium"".  ""Aliens And The Scalpel"" offers startling research by Dr. Roger Leir about alien implants in humans.  Dr. Leir, a surgeon, claims to have removed at least ten alien implants from humans since 1995.  Admitting that he ""started out trying to disprove claims by abductees of implants,"" his research led him in the opposite direction. With videos of surgeries, this presentation is not for the squeamish--aside from that, the implants are a horrifying prospect. I was chilled to the bone.  ""The Billy Meier Case"" explores the psychic connection Billy Meier claims to have with extraterrestrials, as explained by Michael Horn.  Horn gives viewers insight into Billy Meier's experience as a ""prophet"" who was given messages by extraterrestrials since age five.  In support of Meier's claims, Horn discusses an astonishing ""genetic connection"" between humans and extraterrestrials.  If you are in search of real ""X-File"" cases, this one will not disappoint you.  ""Ancient Archeology"" with Kathleen Andersen, a writer for ""Ufologist Magazine"", narrates her exploration into UFO sightings, experiences, and parallels to strange complexities of the Universe.  She explains where the phrase ""flying saucer"" first originated and how it became a generalization for UFOs.  Through her research, she uncovers evidence in ""The Big Foot Valley"" of alien visitors, and discusses the ""common characteristics"" among people who have ET abduction experiences.  Do aliens favor one ethnicity over another when choosing who to abduct?  This documentary identifies the group most often abducted.  ""The Travis Walton Story"" has been depicted in the film ""Fire in the Sky"" (1993), but there is nothing like getting it straight from the source.  Walton discusses the evening he was struck by a bolt of electrified light in the presence of three coworkers.  In a spine-tingling revelation, he shares his reactions as he awakens aboard the craft in dire pain, surrounded by alien beings.  Walton reappeared on ""a familiar road"" after disappearing for 5 days and 6 hours. This is a fascinating story from a person, who by all scientific determinants is credible.  The 1993 movie is not totally accurate, so see this DVD if you want to know what really happened to Travis Walton.  I was stunned by the depth of information in this series!",1205366400,11,2443,5.317708333333333
3105370,4,B0013EJ9TU,V1 is a combination of 4 different UFO docs in one. Great bang for the buck. Watched this with some friends and it sparked hours of discussion on one of my favorite subjects.,1374883200,,174,4.303030303030303
3105371,1,B0013EJ9TU,"After a minute long intro featuring heavy metal music behind a bunch of sci-fi magazine covers, we're treated to..... video footage of a conference that looks like it was taken by a high school student with their dad's camcorder.  And this conference doesn't involve anyone particularly interesting, either.  Yes, Travis Walton, who's story (hole-riddled as it might be) was the inspiration behind the movie ""Fire in the Sky"" speaks, but his and the stories of other U.F.O. witnesses that are discussed on here have been told and re-told many times before this, and nothing new is offered on them by this conference.  Other ""experts"" who speak on this video include a doctor who has allegedly removed 10 ""foreign objects"" from people who claim to have been abducted by aliens.  He states that these devices are clearly alien implants, though he doesn't offer anything much in the way of conclussive evidence that they're even from outer space.  This is a very boring video, and it's not worth even renting.",1345420800,,1006,4.964285714285714

3105373,3,B0013EJ9TU,"This is a low quality recording of a 2003 Conference.

I have studied ufology and alien abduction for a few decades now.
So I am at the point of understanding the phenomenons clearly enough that i have a gained a critical perspective on its presenters.

The only person in this volume that you should listen to and believe is Travis Walton.
I have heard Travis Walton on many radio show interviews and TV shows. This was by far the most detailed description I have heard.
Travis retells his abduction with the genuine emotional traces that remain from his traumatic event.",1318118400,2,572,4.71

The entire film consists of low-quality video of various speakers, re-hashing a number of different subjects and events which have been beaten-to-death over the years. I wasn't able to sit still past the first fifteen minutes, eventually resorting to fast-forwarding through the entire 3-hour video in a search for anything new -- with no luck.  Give it a watch if you don't mind hearing more about things which have been covered again-and-again in other videos and television programming, and have no objection to low production qualities.",1315526400,6,617,5.285714285714286

The second lecture by Walton has some additional interesting facts and graphics from his book.

The third lecture was way out but interesting.  I'd like to burn some time to verify the US related predictions from the 50's.

The fourth ancients lecture could have been very good but her topics were too distinct to pull together.  The Washington State activity was interesting...",1294617600,,454,4.8311688311688314

3105377,3,B0013EJ9TU,"I'd rate this DVD for 4 stars but quality and 1/4 value only are kill it.
First of all this disk is worse only ""Aliens And The Scalpel"" presentation. Even this lecture and other three are poor made quality. If you've been college student this presentations are alike teacher's lecture made by amateur filming in the classroom. There is no any background music or animation no captions (and this is at least would cover unclear sound and Travis Walton mumbling). Dr. Leir probably never knew about high resolution pictures because half of them are blurry. Magnified pictures did not have a highlighted areas what he was presenting. So you have to figure it out from his verbal description coming from speakers with ""hall room"" sound. He speak in so annoying tone that it can easily put you asleep. But if you'll make through first 5-10 minutes you'll finally see magnified pictures of implants he extracted. He sliced it in layers to see what is inside. Well it should come to physicist hands first for studies. Dead alien implant is bad alien and so you do not know about its functionality. According to microscopic studies this implant are beyond human technologies. Well it is shocking for some people however it is so obviously that human body gene code has about 3 billions combinations responsible for regeneration reproduction and so on that this is enough for me to take for fact that this complicity of human body was made not out of spontaneous linking molecules and not of Darvin's evolution theory. Well anyway it worse to watch. $25 can't be made out of sensation. That kind quality cost couple backs.",1251849600,,1613,4.805755395683454
