  The problem with the DVD is no working english subtitles in the movie (spoken in French, I believe) using the WINDVD program in Windows XP.  The movie is dialogue-driven, so watching the movie takes a lot of guess work to understand what's going on.  I stopped watching the movie as I burned out in guessing the storyline in the movie.  If someone has a better DVD player program to properly access the subtitles menu, go for it.  I recommend finding another foreign title to purchase other than this one.",1204416000,,597,4.619047619047619

3033575,4,B000YNFXRS,"Reves de Poussiere (Dreams of Dust) (Laurent Salgues, 2006)

The Horatio Alger story is such an integral part of the American mythology that oftentimes, as Americans, we forget that the meat of it is a global, if not a universal, conceitpeople movie between country A and country B with nothing all the time and try to carve out a place for themselves in a new, oftentimes harsh and unforgiving, culture. Horatio Alger, of course, had his head mired in the stars, and when one looks at such a thing more realistically, one is often best served tempering Horatio Alger well with Alger Hiss. That is certainly the case with Dreams of Dust, the slow, bleak, angry-but-helplessly-so debut film from French director Larent Salgues.

Plot: Mocktar (Lumumba's Makena Diop) is a Niger native who has come to Burkina Fasoto look for work, he says, to raise enough money for his family to come and join him. He goes to work in one of Burkina Faso's primitive, terrifying gold mines, but it quickly becomes obvious that Mocktar has little aptitude for the work (he tells his new boss that he was a farmer in Niger, and we have no reason to disbelieve him). There is a subplot about Mocktar's past, but most reviews make far more of it than there actually is here; I will just note it in passing and stress that this is more a slice-of-life movie than any sort of mystery, a fish out of water trying to make his way in a new society, trying to learn the new skills, both vocational and cultural, he needs to adapt to his new circumstances.

At its heart, the movie is a character study of Mocktar and the often-painful lessons he learns in his first few weeks at the mining camp. The culture shock is low-key, but extreme. Instead of playing the fish out of water angle for laughs, as is so often done, Salgues takes his cue from the edge-of-the-desert landscape of Burkina Fasothis is obvious from the movie's first sequence, which is sublime in its minimalismand keeps the tone of the movie bleak without ever letting it slide all the way into tragedy. A tough line to walk, and to viewers who are more used to mainstream filmmaking, this will likely lead to the ending seeming vague. That's not unintentional; when the movie ends, the lives of the miners at the camp do not, and Salgues does not want us to forget this. This is a good little movie indeedwell worth watching. *** ",1402012800,5,2370,4.5825471698113205

3033579,5,B000YNFXRS,"I have been Film Movement's fan for a while and I must admit that their movies are getting better and better as the time goes by.  This one is set in Africa and actors speak in French.  While the language keeps movie flowing by its beauty, the visual scenes are breathaking.  We learn about a small village which was a place of a gold rush 20 years ago.  Now it is a place full of people who pay out their own pockets to do back breaking and dangerous jobs while being belittled by their superiors.  Most settlers are men and a few women that are around are wives and daughters of the miners some living, some dead.  They have no other means of living but dependign on the charity of the miners.  As the film unfolds we see that most miners have troubled past.  Some used to be rich when they struck gold many years ago; but thir extended families made sure that money is long gone.  Others have lost their family to greed - the villagers would kill the family members of the miners who struck gold.  It quickly becomes obvious that miners are there because they are either society rejects, or they are atoning for the bad luck they unwillingly brought to their families.  All of them are damaged both emotionally and physically.  Their lives are desolate like the mines they live in; their happiness is brought on only by drugs from the local plants and drink from the local bar.  It is amazing to see them desparately search for their life's purpose under disguise of looking for gold.  Their lives follow the shadows of their former selves.  Beautiful film, emotional and touching at once.",1221436800,18,1592,4.498257839721254

The extreme hardships that force men and women to seek work in the unsafe gold mining camps is difficult to watch.  A lot of the back story and events in this movie can be very obscure.
