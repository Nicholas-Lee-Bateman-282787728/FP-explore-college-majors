8477251,5,B005KUG6DK,"The British make the greatest suspense stories. The plots are involved
and the acting is first rate. David Jason is always superb.",1376092800,,130,4.954545454545454
8477252,4,B005KUG6DK,I did se most of the episodes many years a ago.. Purchased the set to see them all. Did indeed think the very good. Just remember they only have U.K. format. I have a 0-9 dvd player so good on me.,1371686400,,196,3.8048780487804876
8477253,4,B005KUG6DK,"I've watched every episode of this popular British TV series, and it was exceptionally written and acted right up to the end. It also has the distinction of having the consistently worst subtitles I have ever seen. My favorite occurs in Season 2. The character says, ""She was in the loo."" The subtitle says, ""She was in the Louvre.""",1359158400,2,332,4.6440677966101696
8477254,4,B005KUG6DK,"I tried out a region 2 dvd that I had on an old dvd player that I bought some years ago to see if it worked. Most players here are region 4 only.
When this proved okay, I then ordered this collection from Amazon.com. I had first seen it on Amazon.uk site, but they wouldn't supply to me. The parcel arrived here a couple of weeks later, well packaged and in good condition. So far I have only watched the first 4 discs (29 total) and found that 1 episode in series 3 was unreadable, visible marks internally on the aluminium could be seen in this disc. I puchased a copy of Series 3 from a local warehouse for less than return mail cost. As far as I know this is the only disc affected. I think that the acting, story lines, and excellence of each episode is outstanding.",1353542400,,771,4.181208053691275
