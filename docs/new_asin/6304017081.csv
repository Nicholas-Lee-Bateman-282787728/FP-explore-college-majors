764242,4,6304017081,"With very little 'dialogue' this film is still interesting, and a little scary. The adventure of a dark-haired caveman who stumbles upon a tribe of blonde-headed cavemen and cavewomen may not sound too interesting but Raquel is hot in her fur bikini!
This is not hokey.
The plot was copied mercilessly by the film ""Caveman"" which plays for laughs rather than this more creepy film.",1051228800,,381,4.876923076923077
764243,3,6304017081,"Raquel Welch was a familiar pop-culture, poster icon in the '60s because her astonishing super structure clad in a fur bikini is the stuff of dreams.  The story of Loana (Welch) of the peaceful Shell people and Tumak (John Richardson) of the warlike Rock people fails to engage the viewer completely.  The stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen covers a multitude of sins, however.  The special effects carry the movie.  Although the first ""dinosaur"" we see is merely an iquana with rubber fins, blown up to fantastic proportions.  This ersatz monster may be typical of Irwin Allen or Bert I. Gordon, but not the superior Ray Harryhausen.  A cost conscious producer must have overruled RH on this one.  The grim story of stone-age survival and primitive struggle lumbers along until the volcanic conclusion.  One problem is the lack of intelligible dialogue and the bewildering use of gestures and grunts that serve as communication.  Character development is minimal.  The color photography is crisp and clear in the VHS transfer.  A distinctive music score adds to the primeval atmosphere.  The individual parts of this movie are better than its whole.  Oddly, this is a Hammer Films production.  It is a definite change of pace from Dracula style horror flicks.  Determined sci-fi fans should be pleased.  Others should tread carefully. ;-)",1024444800,23,1345,5.129032258064516
764244,5,6304017081,"Overlook the fact that this film contains human beings and dinosaurs sharing the same era, and this is a first-rate piece of cinema from start to finish.  A caveman is thrown out of his tribe and ventures into the vast unknown.  These scenes, with their haunting music, atmospheric settings and sense of wonder, are worth getting this video just to see.  Also memorable is the portrayal of the developing coastal society, and of course the prehistoric animals.  Despite the brief appearance of photographically-enlarged iguna and tarantula, the film is mainly top-notch stop-motion.  Some classic sequences involve an Allosaur attacking a village, a Triceratops and Ceratosaurus wrestling and a Pterodactyl carrying off Tumak's loved one.  A classic.",1023148800,2,750,5.422413793103448
764245,5,6304017081,"The cover will tell you if you are interested in this movie or not. Raquel Welch in 1967 (it could be 1997 for all I care) running around in a fur bikini in cavemen times. Except for the grunting and screaming there is no dialog, but if you see the cover and want the movie, than dialog doesn't concern you anyway.
Yes it is scientifically inaccurate. Preschoolers know that mankind didn't exist during the dinosaur age. Grade schoolers know that pteradachdils weren't as big as a house. High schoolers should know that there were no set 'stone tribes' and 'shell tribes'. But at this point, after another look at the cover, you don't care.
You want this movie for Raquel obviously. You will not be disappointed. I can't believe they were actually able to develop the celluloid. She's so hot I'm surprised it didn't melt in the process. Her sexuallity is so obvious that any man would love to live in a cave for awhile and eat raw boar with her. Of course her tribe lived at the beach and except for giant turtles, they really had no problems. So be a man and be not ashamed to run right out and order or buy this flick. She made it for you, so by all means enjoy it!
After seeing this, you'll wonder why Bo Derek made the movie '10'. The answer is that Raquel rates an 11 and maybe the world isn't ready for that movie yet.
Raquel Welch? Hubba hubba.",1010966400,10,1351,4.365079365079365

764247,4,6304017081,"After the commercial failure of FIRST MEN IN THE MOON, Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer briefly parted ways. Schneer made HALF A SIXPENCE; Harryhausen was hired by Hammer Films to do the effects in a proposed  remake of the film that inspired his career, KING KONG. Unfortunately, this  feature was never made because the rights could not be secured at that time  from the estate of Merian C. Cooper. So Ray suggested they remake a 1940  movie that starred Carole Landis and Victor Mature, and included a  multitude of lizards that were photographically enlarged to stand-in as the  prehistoric fauna. He felt he could do better here.
  The saurians of  ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. are expertly crafted in this picture. He  collaborated with Arthur Hayward, a preparator at the British Museum of  Natural History to design these monsters. Indeed, they are a quantum leap  over the previous dinosaurs he animated in the film ANIMAL WORLD ( which  has never been released on video ). Oddly enough, Ray did include an iguana  optically blown-up as one of the prehistorics; many criticized this move  but now it seems more like an homage to the original offering.
  Included in the Mesozoic menagerie is a large sea turtle called an Archelon  that lumbers its way to the sea in a torpid manner; a battle between a  gigantic Ceratosaurus ( scaled to T. Rex proportions ) and a huge  Triceratops, and a fight between Pterosaurs while Ms. Welch is clutched in  one's talons. The highlight of the stop-motion ensemble is the small  Allosaurus that reeks havoc in the Shell Tribe's camp. This creature is  almost a carbon copy of a carnosaur he did many years earlier in 16mm  footage. It is killed in an excellent coup de grace, impaled on a pole that  is a marvel of miniature rear-projection work.
  Starring Raquel Welch  ( not her first movie role ) and John Richardson as the lovers Loana and  Tumak, they represent the ""beautiful people"" of eons past. The  storyline is almost nonexistent here: Tumak is ostracized from the Rock  Tribe and wanders the wilderness until he is taken in by the Shell Tribe.  Booted out after nearly killing one of its members, he wanders again with  Loana in tow. After many encounters with human and animal perils they  arrive at the Rock Tribe's camp to attack Tumak's evil brother ( who  deposed his dad in a brutal manner ). As the attack is underway, a nearby  volcano violently erupts and utterly destroys the landscape.
  Martine  Beswick and Percy Herbert co-star in this feature. Directed by Don Chaffy,  who worked with Harryhausen earlier on JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. The movie  was shot on the Canary Island of Lanzarote and on sets back in England. In  spite of the superficial story and the use of contrived ""words""  as a pigeon language, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. is an exciting film with  plenty of Mesozoic menances and Raquel to please the eyes. Only unsuitable  for very young children ( < 5 yrs. of age ).",945561600,35,2947,4.737154150197629
764248,4,6304017081,"""One Million Years B.C"" is the ultimate guilty pleasure of a movie.  There is not a shred of scientific accuracy to it, but the movie is so fun thanks to Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur FX and Raquel Welch in a fur  bikini that you don't care.",940118400,2,238,4.266666666666667
764249,3,6304017081,"One Million Years BC is one of the most unusual films evermade.  The film contains almost no dialogue and calls for its cast -primary performers are John Richardson, Raquel Welsh, Martine Bestwick, and Percy Herbert - to ""act"" as cavepeople, a task that can test even the hardiest of performers.  At times, the human performers seem ill at ease in their roles as humans within the film's titular period of time.
Nonetheless they succeed in pulling it off, aided by the film's intimidating scenery (shot in the volcanic Canary Islands), the chilling minimalist music, and Ray Harryhausen's superb stop-motion dinosaurs.  There has been a long-running debate over who is responsible for the film's success - Raquel Welsh or Harryhausen's dinosaurs.  Certainly the presence of Welsh gives the film sex appeal (aimed for by the endless promotion of her role) but Harryhausen's dinosaurs give the film a substance and longevity it otherwise might not have.
The ""story,"" such as it is, involves two tribes, the gentle Shell Tribe of Luana (Welsh) and the harsher Rock People of Tumak (Richardson).  Tumak is exiled from his tribe and is discovered by the Shell Tribe on a lonely beach.  A bond soon develops between Tumak and Luana, and both soon find themselves encountering a variety of Harryhausen-created dinosaurs.
The film doesn't strive to do anything other than tell its story.  This is both a weakness and a strength, and makes for an interesting and unusual film.",933638400,10,1467,5.037190082644628

This story is the definitive girl meets Dino. It is not all just a fury story there is a script and love involved. Then there are the haps and mishaps of the Shell people Vs the Stone people.

If the pre-historic menagerie looks familiar, with the exception of the iguana, we can thank Ray Harryhausen's talents. This movie is a classic on many levels and should be in your collection.

764445,4,6304017081,"BOTTOM LINE: Ray + Raquel = nuff said!

THE STORY: The film chronicles the daily struggle for life during prehistoric times between the savage, single-minded Stone People & the more advanced, enlightened Seashell Tribe. Meanwhile, rumbling volcanoes blow up while bloodthirsty dinosaurs prowl the landscape and soar through the skies, terrorizing everything & everyone in site.

THOUGHTS: Perhaps the greatest combination to ever grace a motion picture are featured in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C., as legendary stop-motion F/X artist extraordinaire Ray Harryhausen teams his considerable talents with Raquel Welch's tanned, oil-slathered breasts - two talents which are pretty considerable on their own. Seriously though, has there ever been a more luscious, stunning woman than Raquel in this film?? Undoubtedly responsible for launching many a young boy headlong into puberty, Raquel Welch is just about the sexiest thing ever here. Ray's stop-mo dinos are among his best work too, with the blood-soaked battle between John Richardson & a rampaging Allosaurus being a real standout. Impressive locations accentuated by excellent cinematography really help sell the picture's barren prehistory look while an arresting orchestral score & inventive sound effects design by composer Mario Nascimbene add aural flavor to the stone-age proceedings.

THE BLU-RAY: Kino Lorber brings us this classic Saturday creature feature staple in glorious hi-def. The U.S. cut received a full 4k restoration; a really superb upgrade of both video & audio quality, well worth double dipping - if you already own the DVD. A bevy of rock solid bonus features make this purchase a no-brainer for fans & collectors. Among them are interviews with stars Raquel Welch & Martine Bestwick, a vintage interview with the late Ray Harryhausen, an interesting full-length audio commentary from film historian Tim Lucas, photo galleries, trailers, and more. Don't wait one million years to buy this one! Highly, highly recommended.",1496534400,6,1995,5.555921052631579

the Kino Lorber version & the U.K. Studio canal version
both are equally worth buying the U.K. blu-ray worth more than the U.S. in my opinion
the HD transfers for both reissues look equally fantastic Kino and studio canal have both done an excellent job with the picture quality
both transfers have No Grain, No Dirt, very sharp & clear picture qualiy no Doubt about it
much better quality than the very old dvd versions that's for sure
the only difference is the screen ratio's of both reissues are not the same
the U.S. blu-ray is in 1:85:1 which was not the original screen ratio the film was presented back in the 60's
for some reason Kino widen the ratio to 1:85:1 when it shouldve been 1:66:1
the production behind one million years B.C. was Hammer films from the U.K. so the film was originally 1:66:1 only
which is what the U.K. blu-ray is, the ratio on the U.K. blu-ray is 1:66:1 not 1:85:1
the sound quality for both reissues is the same 2.0 master audio mixes
the EXTRAS difference
well Kino have added an audio commentary plus a new interview with Actress Martine beswick, plus Theatrical trailer, stills Gallery etc
and actually U.K. studio canal have added 2 interviews new interviews with both Martine beswick & Racquel welch
plus the original trailer & stills Gallery
so actually both reissues are worth buying in my opinion either get the 1:85:1 ratio blu-ray or the original 1:66:1 ratio

764711,4,6304017081,"This is a review for the blu-ray version of One Million Years B.C. by Kino Lorber released in February, 2017.

This is the 1966 remake of One Million Years B.C. which made Raquel Welch a star. She had starred previously in 'Fantastic Voyage' but this is the movie that made her famous. The cover image of her is the animal skin bikini has become an iconic image, probably the most famous image from a dinosaur movie. The movie itself is a fairly entertaining 1960's sci-fi fantasy film in which you must suspend disbelief if you are going to enjoy it. Most significantly it features humans in the time of dinosaurs when if fact, dinosaurs had died out approximately 65 million years prior to the time period depicted.

BLU-RAY (4k): I didn't have high expectations of the print quality but it was decent. I watched the U.S. version. I am no expert in film quality. The print was clean as I didn't seen any spots or imperfections. The clarity was at times real good and at other times a bit blurry. Essentially it looked like a decent transfer with blu-ray quality with the imperfections cleaned up. I don't really know if it is possible to make a better print. It might just be that that is the way it was filmed and some of the blurry parts are there from when the movie was filmed.

EXTRA'S: Significantly you get a 4k restoration of the U.S. cut of the film. You also get the international cut. The interational version is 9 minutes longer at 100 minutes.

There is no commentary and there are no subtitles. Of course no English is spoken in the movie. However subtitles might have made it easier to follow the made up language.

There are three interviews:

Raquel Welch - I anticipated this the most but it was less than 15 minutes. It did have some interesting tidbits.
Martine Beswick - The longest interview was somewhat interesting. She seemed to gush over John Richardson and how handsome he was.
Ray Harryhausen - I've seen so many interviews with him so that to me this was the least interesting.

Lastly, you get a trailer.

PLOT/SUMMARY:  The narrator tells us that this is the story of two brothers, Tumak (John Richardson) and Sakana. That is not entirely true, it is a bit more than that.

Tumak and Sakana are depicted as rivals for their father's (Akhoba) approval. Early on, Tumak and his father get into a fight over food. Essentially it is for the leadership of tribe. I'm not quite sure who's idea this fight was. Akhoba wins the fight and leaves his son for dead. Tumak survives and takes off. He walks for awhile and passes out near a beach. Apparently even though they are near the water, nobody from their tribe has ever traveled that far. This is hard to believe when you look at the landscape they live in. It is almost completely barren and in order to find food they would probably have to travel quite a bit to find it. At this beach, lo and behold, is a bunch of blonde haired beauties led by Loana (Raquel Welch). All the men are blonde too. They take Tumak back to their cave, which is much prettier than the previous one. They are also much more advanced and use many tools and the leader does not appear to be the strongest person. Loana nurses Tumak back to health and promptly falls in love. Unfortunately Loana has another man from her own tribe who is in love with her and he gets into a fight with Tumak. Tumak wins but is stopped short of killing his rival by the tribe. Tumak is sent packing. He leaves but Loana chooses to go with him. Tumak and Loana go back to Tumak's original cave where he challenges his brother for leadership. His brother Sakana has taken leadership after treachery against his father. From here things get a bit wacky. Raquel Welch gets into a famous cat fight with Martine Beswick over Tumak. Loana is taken by a flying dinosaur. Tumak goes after her. Sakana tries to take back leadership. Tumak returns with the blonde warriors in tow and then....what a surprise....a volcano erupts and makes a mess of everything....

PRODUCTION: One Million Years B.C. was created by the famous English movie studio, Hammer Films. It had special effects by the master of stop motion, Ray Harryhausen. The outdoor scenes were shot in the Canary Islands.

According to Harryhausen in the interview included in the extra's, the budget was 400,000 to 500,000 pounds, which was a decent amount at the time. Stop motion is used for most of the dinosaurs with the exception of the first one you see and the tarantula. In that sequence they use the lizards with glued on fins method (I'm not sure if there were any fins glued on)! For the most part the stop motion animation is good. However when people are used in the animation it doesn't look all that good even for the times. I suppose it was very difficult to make realistic looking humans using stop motion effects. If Harryhausen couldn't make it look good, I don't suppose anybody could.

The acting was average at best. John Richardson as Tumak was just OK as was Raquel Welch as Loana. Martine Beswick was the other female star. At the time she was considered very beautiful and she was a Bond girl. While attractive, she isn't my cup of tea. I much prefer Raquel Welch. I'm not sure any movie from the time period portrayed cave men in a believable way.

CONCLUSIONS: One Million Years B.C. is a fairly entertaining movie. Obviously there were no people in the time of the dinosaurs but as Ray Harryhausen says, you have to look past that in order to have an entertaining movie. As simple as it is, it gets slightly confusing at the end, especially since the characters speak in a made up language. You don't always know what the characters are trying to do. But then again, that's probably the way it was.

There are some other plot holes too. It's highly unlikely that two tribes so close to each other would have never come across each other. Not to mention that one is all blonde and the other all brunette. The land seemed mostly barren and without any animals to hunt.

The Dinosaurs, which are supposed to be the star of the show, are mostly in the movie for some action sequences but don't move the plot much at all. They are mostly stop motion but a few are not. Besides the enlarged lizard you also have a tarantula that looks much the same as it does in any movie with tarantula's when a live one is used and enlarged. The sequence are fairly well done, especially the attack by the Allosaurus and the fight between the Triceratops and the Ceratosaurus.

This is probably as good as you will ever see this movie. It made Raquel Welch a star and while at the time she wasn't thrilled with making it, she admits in her interview in the extra's, it is the movie that made her famous.

I give it 4 stars for the picture quality, 3 stars for the plot, 4 stars for the extra's.
Overall I give this release 4 stars out of 5.

Recommended for fans of Raquel Welch, dinosaur movies and fans of 60's sci-fi/fantasy.",1487462400,6,6925,4.507974481658692

You can really see and appreciate Ray's attention to detail,  and how well his animated dinosaurs blend with the live action via his Dynamation process.  Includes both the American release and a slightly longer British release of the movie;  2 discs!!  Special features include interviews with Raquel Welch , Matine Beswick, and of course Ray Harryhausen!  It's interesting to learn, for example, that Raquel Welch did not want to do the movie, and only did it because she was under contact and basically had to do it.  This is an absolute gift to Harryhausen fans and Kino Lorber has done a first rate job on it.  Buy and enjoy!!!",1487203200,6,804,4.760869565217392
764714,5,6304017081,"The wait is finally over and with this Ray Harryhausen film making its Blu Ray debut and The Valley of Gwangi being released March 14th (MOD?!), the Master of Majick's film collection is complete on this format (excluding The Early Years Collection and Animal World).

One Million Years B.C. is one of the odder Harryhausen films, there is little dialogue except in the narrative. The creatures in the film are mostly actual dinosaurs that lived at one time and the film just has a different feel with its melodramatic overtones.

The story of Tumak the cave man and his adventures, discovering new cultures and life threatening obstacles is both fun and humorous at times. It's easy to laugh at cavemen grunting and using only the simplest forms of communication. We know this, cave men like meat, they like women, are very competitive and don't give a Rat's A$$ about the weak or elderly.

The real reason to enjoy this film is to marvel over Ray Harryhausen's wonderful special effects. I've been a fan of Ray's since I was a small child in the early 60's watching his early black and white films on TV. I was lucky enough to see many of his early color films on the big screen at Saturday Matinees in my local theater. Yes, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (double billed with Jack the Giant Killer), Jason and the Argonauts and One Million Years B.C. were among the many to shape my youth and love for stop motion effects. It wouldn't be until The Golden Voyage of Sinbad that I would see a Ray Harryhausen film first run in a theater and actually go to see it because it was a Ray Harryhausen film.

This new 2 disc blu ray release is near perfect, first and for most we get both the U.S. and original U.K. versions of the film looking their best ever. Each version of the film gets it's own disc with a few nice bonus features. The features include commentary on the U.K. version, U.K trailer (rough looking but it's here) and a poster and stills gallery On the U.S. version disc we get a 12 interview with RH himself, an 8 minute one with Raquel Welch and a 16 minute one with Martine Beswick (one of the cave women, who shares some candid stories) and the U.S. trailer (also rough looking, but not as bad as the U.K. version) It would have been nice to include a featurette on the film, but if you own any of Harryhausen's documentaries you already have all that has been said about this extraordinary artist.

The new 4K transfer for both films looks beautiful and identical with the exception of the added scenes. The U.K. cut, (which I do not believe I have seen before) is the superior version, fleshing out some scenes that seemed insignificant in the U.S. cut. The dinosaur scenes have some extra time and both intro and ending of the film are different, not so much as to change the story, but the way they are presented.

I'm pleased they included both versions because they do have a little different feel to them. I grew up watching the U.S. version so it will save some shelf space to be able to discard my old DVD copy.

If you're a fan of this film or Ray's work, this is a no brainer, I doubt we will see a better release of this film. the transfer looks virtually flawless with only a few shots of the landscape where the film appears soft. This is one of the best treatments of one of Mr. Harryhausen's films on blu ray and a must buy for fans.",1487203200,19,3361,4.411290322580645

764717,5,6304017081,"One Million Years B.C.  (1966) is one of the few movies where Ray Harryhausen's prehistoric creations actually have to compete for your attention.  Raquel Welch and her fur bikini, immortalized by pop culture posters, is every bit as eye-popping in the role of Loana, a fair-haired cavegirl who teaches the finer points of life to Tumak (John Richardson) a rough-and-rowdy exile from a neighboring tribe.  As the pair dodges dinosaurs, natural disasters and cannibalistic missing links, the film gets by without a single word of English dialogue, delivering one of the most memorable stop-motion spectaculars of the era.

The biggest success in Hammer Films' history (a company known far better for its gothic horror output) actually began as a remake of Hal Roach's 1940 version, which starred Victor Mature and Carol Landis running away from photographically enlarged lizards and snakes.  Producer Michael Carreras (who also wrote the script) upped the ante by bringing in Harryhausen to duplicate his more convincing effects work on pictures like Jason and the Argonauts.  Director Don Chaffey was also retained to deal with the location choreography on what was easily the studio's most ambitious project - and biggest gamble - ever.

Shot in the beautifully brutal landscape of the Canary Island, One Million Years B.C. opens with a bit of self-important narration to set the scene (again, the only English spoken in the film), then proceeds to tell the story of Tumak, part of a tribe of prehistoric trailer trash with no culture, no class and no mercy.  Kicked out after a family squabble, Tumak heads for greener pastures...and finds one at the edge of the ocean where he collapses into the arms of Loana.

Part of the peaceful Shell Tribe, Loana is instantly smitten with her wandering bad boy, even though he's a bad fit with the rest of the group.  As successful fisherman, gardeners, and artisans, the tribe has no use for the clueless Tumak...that is until he proves himself when ambushed by a hungry Allosaurus!  But Tumak's fame is short-lived and soon he's back on the road, this time with Loana in tow, to return to his original stomping ground and wrest control back from his surly paternal relatives.

A prehistoric road movie of sorts, the script sends Tumak on a Fury Road-style journey there and back again, forcing him to face the same threats but with new-found knowledge, skills and compassion.  For those who grew up watching the film on endless Sunday afternoon repeats, One Million Years B.C. needs no defending.  Harryhausen's work, despite a brief optically enlarged iguana that stands out like a sore thumb, is some of the most impressive in his long career.  But the best compliment one can pay to Chaffey's film is that it's never boring.  Even the scenes that don't involve some sort of flying, jumping or slithering monstrosity have a scope and scale that keep the viewer engaged.  And that fur bikini is like the cherry on top of an already irresistible fantasy treat.

Kino Lorber's 4K restoration of both the U.S. and international version (which runs 10 minutes longer) is one of those holy grails for Harryhausen collectors.  And it doesn't disappoint, starting with an incredible transfer that pops right from the opening credits.  Yes, the matte lines and color shifts are a bit more visible, but you'll be surprised at exactly how good the effects hold up even in hi-def.  Extras include trailers, posters and stills, an invaluable Tim Lucas audio commentary and 15 minute sit-down interviews with Harryhausen, co-star Martine Beswick and Raquel Welch herself...who's just a dismissive of the experience as you might expect.  Overall, this is an essential piece of any legit Blu-ray collection.",1486598400,,3737,5.042276422764227

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. is the spectacular prehistoric adventure with a vivid view of prehistoric life, especially with a man named Tumak [John Richardson] who is a caveman and son of the leader from the mean-spirited and hostile Rock People is banished from his home after a fight. Wandering through brutal prehistoric lands he soon encounters terrifying dinosaurs, giant spiders and Apemen. Battered and bruised, he collapses on a remote beach weary and injured. Loana played by bikini-clad Raquel Welch, in the role that made her a major star, is the daughter of the chief of The Shell Tribe, stumbles upon him, taking pity on the injured and exhausted wanderer, and nursing him back to health. The highlight of the film was the stop motion dinosaurs, with stunning primeval imagery created by pioneering and legendary special effects animator wizard Ray Harryhausen. ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. is a true science fiction classic that is Hammer Film Productions biggest commercial success. Narrated by Vic Perrin.

This 50th Anniversary ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. Blu-ray release of this prehistoric classic has been stunningly and fully restored in 4K for the very first time and featuring brand new bonus features.

FILM FACT: Originally Hammer Film Productions offered the role of Loana to Ursula Andress. When Ursula Andress passed on the project due to commitments and salary demands, a search for a replacement resulted in the selection of Raquel Welch. The USA release was censored for a broader audience, losing around nine minutes. Deleted scenes included a provocative dance from Martine Beswick, a gruesome end to one of the ape-men in the cave and some footage of the Allosaurus attack on the Shell tribe. Nonetheless, the film was still popular and made $2.5 million in USA rentals during its first year of release. All the dinosaur models from this film still exist, although the Ceratosaurus and Triceratops were repurposed for The Valley of Gwangi [1969].

Andrews Blu-ray Review: For those of you who get a little light-headed thinking about Wilma Flintstone will have to get a cold compress when viewing ONE MILLION B.C. [1966]. Yes it is Raquel Welch in a scantily clad fur bikini, especially for all you red blooded males out there. By the way did we mention there are dinosaurs as well as a bonus?

ONE MILLION B.C. was Hammer Film Productions attempt to cash in on the short-lived dinosaur exploitation trend, which thrived despite complaints and the scientific impossibility of humans co-existing with dinosaurs. You know how these films went: big lizards, scantily clad cave folk and lots of rocks. Told in pantomime with no spoken dialogue, except for occasional grunts, the fun in this film is catching all of the anachronisms from the cave peoples sophisticated hairstyles and flawless make-up to their perfect teeth. In the future, this type of film would lead to the various other films like Quest for Fire [1981] and Jurassic Park [1993] but at the same time ONE MILLION B.C. was a drive-in favourite film of that genre and a definite firm favourite film of mine and proud of it, despite looking a bit camp for todays modern audiences.

As the film opens, the narrator informs us, This is a story of long, long ago; when the world was just beginning. We get to meet our caveperson hero, Tumak [John Richardson], who fights with his father and gets kicked out of the Rock People tribe and wanders a bit before discovering the Shell People with Raquel Welch attached. The two youngsters fall in love while eventually a war ignites between the different tribes, making this perhaps a cave-dwelling Romeo and Juliet. Officially it is a remake of the 1940s film One Million B.C. which starred Victor Mature, a one-time matinee idol whose bust could rival Ms. Raquel Welch's! Particularly memorable is the sequence where Raquel Welch emerges from a lake and is promptly snatched up and carried away by a flying reptile. While it is true that most of the creatures are animated models, there is one fight sequence featuring two live lizards disguised as Mesozoic creatures. This wasn't intended as homage to the original version, which did use lizards as dinosaur stand-ins, was due to budgetary necessity.

The effects themselves blend stop-motion animation and enlarged shots of real creatures. The first dinosaur to be seen is a real iguana. Ray Harryhausen claimed that a live reptile was used to persuade the audience that all the subsequent monsters they saw were real as well. This technique isn't particularly effective; the iguana harks back to the 1940 version, where all the dinosaurs were prosthetically enhanced reptiles.

Hammer Film Productions producer Michael Carreras, based the screenplay for ONE MILLION B.C. very closely on Hal Roachs original dinosaur film, but was determined the realisation of the dinosaur effects would be the best that Hammer Film Productions could afford: We decided if were going to make the film at all, we had to have the latest technique of making these things look real. Enter visual effects legend Ray Harryhausen, whod just completed The First Men in the Moon [1964] for Columbia and, with no further projects in the pipeline with his partner Charles Schneers Morningside Productions, accepted Hammer Film Productions offer to work on the film and recalls: I hate remakes but I felt we could do better than the original 1940 version.

ONE MILLION B.C. was filmed in the Canary Islands though the dinosaurs were the work of animation master Ray Harryhausen, which included The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad [1958]. Holding this all together was director Don Chaffey, who cut his teeth on TV series The Avengers and such films as Jason and the Argonauts [1963]. As the location shoot in Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria began, the crew were beset with harsh weather conditions. Rain lasted three days, the wind blew all the trees down, and, as Raquel Welch recalled, a clear sunny sky would switch to dropping snow with no warning at all. Despite the delays caused by the elements Don Chaffey and Ray Harryhausen choreographed their actors on the rugged, volcanic landscapes and, as Raquel Welch remarked, told us exact eyelines to match the, as yet, unrealised stop-motion dinosaurs.

Principal photography completed on 6 January 1966, and Ray Harryhausen was already underway on a nine-month stint completing the stop-motion animation effects for the film. Pre-production work involved an intense period of research and model making in collaboration with Arthur Hayward of the British Museum of Natural History. With Arthur Haywards help, he was able to examine the fossils available to create very accurate representations of the extinct dinosaurs featured in the film.

Pre-production work involved an intense period of research and model making in collaboration with Arthur Hayward of the British Museum of Natural History. With Arthur Haywards help, he was able to examine the fossils available to create very accurate representations of the extinct dinosaurs featured in the film. Ray Harryhausen commented to Arthur Hayward: We wanted the creatures accurate. He sculpted the clay models based on my drawings, and made moulds for me, and then I cast and built the animated models. He was a very good artist. Although a brontosaurus is briefly glimpsed in the background as Tumak is cast out of his tribe and treks across the wasteland to encounter Loana and the Shell tribe, its the superb sequence where they encounter the Archelon, a giant turtle on the beach that first ushers in the Ray Harryhausen magic.

Hammer Film Productions studios was quite wise in capitalizing on Ms. Raquel Welch's natural attributes for this epic and even went so far as to send out over 10,000 Christmas cards of the practically naked Raquel Welch in her fur bikini to several theatre owners all over Europe and the U.S.A. The ploy obviously worked; the film's international take at the box-office was over $9 million, not bad for a film where the actors' chief line of dialogue was ""ugh!"" So if your Time Machine is broken you can always view this brilliant Blu-ray disc and get a trip to One Million Years B.C. with the assurance that you won't be squished between some T. Rex's toes and what a shame it was not made in 3D. Still despite this, I suppose you could say now that is what you call progress!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Hammer Film Productions and StudioCanal brings you this brand new remastered Blu-ray disc in a wonderful 1080p 4K restoration upgrade encoded image, especially now being shown in glorious Technicolor process and an equally impressive 1.66:1 aspect ratio. This restoration captures the many creatures very well, adding a clear and well-defined aspect to them. Ray Harryhausens stop motion work on the creatures/monsters, that range from a giant iguana to a Triceratops, are great and how he, even in the 1960s, managed to mesh his work with the actors is impressive to this day. The film also gains from the restoration when the creatures aren't on-screen, but with the many landscapes which are enhanced brilliantly. Theres a bleak colour scheme that dominates the early Tumak scenes, as he explores the land, which is nicely contrasted with the majestic greenery of Loanas tribes land. Despite by todays standards, the animation effects of the creatures were very basic, however, when you take into consideration that this film was released in 1966 then the work done by Ray Harryhausen is amazing. If it wasn't for the breakthrough special effects he has done here, many of the special effects that dominates cinema today wouldnt have happened. Everyone has a huge debt to pay to Ray Harryhausen because he widened the boundaries of what cinema can do by introducing monsters and having them interact with the actual actors. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Hammer Film Productions and StudioCanal has finally released in the UK Blu-ray Release in an impressive brand new remastered wonderful 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio (RCA Sound Recording), but on the DVD you only get to hear it in 2.0 Mono Audio (RCA Sound Recording) and despite the soundtrack only being in Mono, it is still very impressive and such shame it could not have been upgrade at least in stereo. What impressed me very much were the outstanding and surprisingly gripping bass levels heard almost from the beginning and notable throughout the film. The prehistoric dialogue by the actors has been spread across the front soundstage rather than being done directionally, but its always very clear and precise. You also get some interesting sound effects with the waves pounding on the shore, heavy winds whirling, and the avalanche-pounding rock slides when the volcano finally erupts. What are also very impressive sounds is when the prehistoric animals do battle with each other and you get that wonderful roar. When Raquel Welch emerges from a lake and is promptly snatched up and carried away by a flying reptile it is also a good screeching sound effect and with combination of Ray Harryhausen stop motion animation, you feel that the flying reptile is real. The composer Mario Nascimbenes score gets woven impressively throughout the entire two channel sound mix experience, as well as the interpreted prehistoric musical instruments heard also throughout the film to give the film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. a touch authenticity.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: New interview with Raquel Welch [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:14] Here we get to see for the very first time Raquel Welch since appearing in the film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. and boy does this lady looks really stunning for her age. Raquel starts to talk about the start of her career in acting, and tells us that she was lucky enough to secure a contract with 20th Century Fox and at the time of just finishing shooting the film Fantastic Voyage and of the blue Darryl F. Zanuck called her to his office and tells Raquel that he has a fantastic part in a new film for her that he felt would be totally perfect for her and of course Raquel was intrigued and want to know what the film was, so Darryl tells her that it is called ONE MILLION YEARS B.C., but Raquel immediately was totally not impressed and very sceptical, and especially appearing with dinosaurs, so to put her mind at ease, he tells Raquel that it will be a classic film, but was still very reluctant to appear in the film, but then Darryl F. Zanuck had to remind Raquel Welch that she was still under contract and on top of all that would be put under suspension, so with a big sigh, Raquel agreed to appear in the film, then on top of all that Darryl F. Zanuck informs Raquel that it is a British film and that Raquel would be working at the Elstree Studios of Associated British Productions Limited, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England and also working on different locations on the Canary Islands, off the coast of Spain, but the other incentive for Raquel Welch is that she would be at the height of Swinging London. But one other problem Raquel was concerned about is what type of clothing would she be wearing, being the setting is One Million Years B.C. Raquel Welch then gets down to the experience of working on the location on the Canary Islands, and of course had to work where the volcano is located, and of course all you could view was lava rock and all in all it was not a fun experience, especially the fact that Raquel had to wear the skimpy costume all the time, whereas all the crew were wearing lots of clothes, as the weather was freezing and at the same time the camera use to freeze up, so to solve the problem they hung a pot under the camera that was full of red hot coals that kept the film camera from freezing up. What Raquel also didn't like about the weather is that most of the time she was very ill and they had to have a doctor on call to keep Raquel free from being ill. But despite this flawed experience, Raquel found the Canary Islands was a total perfect location shooting and was so ideal to give the film the look of One Million Years B.C. Raquel also talks about the director Don Chaffey who she thought was a lovely person, but very tightly wrapped up into getting the film shot on schedule, as well as making sure you are in the right position when the camera rolls so you can be combined with the prehistoric animals that were added in afterwards with the finished film, but the only negative aspect Raquel felt of the director is that he was very tight lipped with instructions on what he wanted out of his actors, but when Raquel Welch tried to talk to Don Chaffey on a personal level, again he was not very forthcoming, and was also very abrasive in wanting Raquel do a certain scene in a certain way. Raquel also talks about her then fianc who was an aficionado on the brilliant stop motion animator Ray Harryhausen, who of course was at the time the master his animation technique, and was of course totally revered person in the film industry, and when the film was shot, Raquel with her two small children Damon Welch and Tahnee Welch took a trip to Ray Harryhausens work shop and were all totally enthralled with Ray Harryhausen and his technique of moving the models when filming them and all in all they thought he was extraordinary. Raquel gets round to talking about the costume designer Sir. Carl Toms [1927  1999] who Raquel thought was totally amazing, who also designed clothes for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and other London theatrical companies, and when Raquel had to meet him for a costume fit, and found Carl very charming and showed Raquel all the sketches he had done for the clothes for her character Loana and was totally amazed and bowled over by his clothes designs. Raquel also talks about her fellow actor John Richardson, who Raquel found to be a very nice and a very charming person to act with and on top of all that Raquel thought he was a very handsome man and had very piercing blue eyes, and also the least vain man she ever met and told Raquel in private that his big love was to be a photographer and would always carry his camera around with him all the time on location, As we come to near the end of this personal interview, Raquel informs us that she really enjoyed working on the film, but also became very allergic to the drug penicillin, especially when Raquel got back home to Los Angeles, but despite this, it was still a great filming experience and met some really nice people, and became a very good friend to fellow actress Martine Beswick, but also met in London the famous photographer Terry ONeal who took some fantastic photographs of Raquel Welch, and of course the famous fur lined bikini clad photograph caused a total sensation when released to the general public, but at this moment in time with this interview, and just about the end of this very interesting interview, it just finishes suddenly without warning, which was really sad, as Raquel Welch was getting to a really interesting point in the interview. So despite this, it was still a totally fascinating interview and well worth viewing and again I just couldn't get over how wonderful Raquel Welch looked for her age and obviously time has been very good to this actress.

Special Feature: New interview with Martine Beswick [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [15:54] Here we get to see Martine Beswick in a private cinema, and the first thing we find out is that Martine Beswick was born in Jamaica and lived there until getting work in the film industry and especially a part in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. and one day saw a bizarre advert in a newspaper saying a producer was scouting for actors in a new film. And with a load of other young ladies had an interview and was one of them that got the call, but all happened because a photographer took loads of photos of Martine in lots of locations in Jamaica and people in London contacted Martine as they were very impressed and received a letter from the MCA Agency inviting Martine to have an interview in London and when Martine arrived, was interviewed with 12 men in suits, and a James Bond film was mentioned, but Martine was very nave about James Bond as she had never heard about it or the author Ian Fleming, so was none the wiser, and was actually shipped out to appear in the film DR. NO but unfortunately never got to appear in the film as they told her she had not had enough acting experience, but if she did get some acting experience would be offered a part in the next James Bond film, and when FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was about to start shooting, Martine got the call to appear in the film and that experience started her film career, but also started a career working in television, and also had a modelling career. But out of the blue got another call from the James Bond people to ask her to appear in the film THUNDERBALL and of course this was a first to appear in two James Bond films, which normally did not happen and because the films had such a status reputation, never had to audition for a part in the Hammer Film Productions of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. When Martine got to go to the Canary Islands it was in the middle of December and of course it kept raining all the time, nut despite this Martine found it an amazing place to be in, and the location where they stayed had only one hotel and it all felt very primitive, and found people actually living in caves and the volcano you see in the film. But the one person that really impressed Martine was Ray Harryhausen, who she really adored and just wanted to sit at his feet and hear all his anecdote stories and found him truly wonderful to work with and Martine also really felt Ray Harryhausen made the film and was totally amazed when Martine saw the finished film. When flying back to London after finishing the shoot Martine was invited to Ray Harryhausens work shop and watched Ray Harryhausen working all the models and filming them at the same time, and again really admired him and of course throughout the film industry classed as a genius, and Martine was very proud to have worked with Ray Harryhausen and also over time became good friends. Martine talks about the famous fight scene in the film with Raquel Welch and at one point they brought in two female stunt doubles, but both Martine and Raquel while watching the scene pointed out it was not working, as they look nothing like the two female actors and insisted they should do the fight scene themselves, but the studio said no because of the insurance problem, but they both put their foot down and were given the go ahead to appear in the famous scene and they both enjoyed the experience. Martine talks about the male actor John Richardson, and every time Martine saw him in a restaurant, her whole body would quiver, that is the effect John Richardson had on her, and when Martine heard she would be acting with him was very reluctant, but when Martine finally met John Richardson, it felt like fireworks went off, that is the affect he had on her, but when Martine saw John without his beard, commented that she could not appear with him, as he was much prettier than Martine, but of course it was a very tongue in cheek comment. Then at that precise moment and like the previous interview, the film suddenly stops abruptly and I feel this is very unprofessional and cannot understand why they allowed this to happen. But despite this slight negative comment, again like the previous interview, this again was totally fascinating and a must watch.

Special Feature: Exclusive Ray Harryhausen Stills, Storyboard and Artwork [2016] [1080p] [4:40] Here we get a selection of wonderful and brilliant original sketches, storyboards, location photography and model imagery that gives a unique insight into how Ray Harryhausen conceptualised key sequences for the film ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. during early production. What you also get is with each section is interspaced with Chapter Headings informing you what you are about to view and they are as follows: THE ARCHELON SEQUENCE; THE ALLOSARUS SEQUENCE; THE TRICERATOPS vs CERATOSAURUS SEQUENCE; THE PTERANODON SEQUENCE and THE BRONTOSAURUS  INCLUDING UNFILMED SEQUENCE. All photography was by Andy Johnson. All material and models were by kind permission of The Ray & Diana Harryhausen Foundation.

Special Feature: Production Stills Gallery [2016] [1080p] Here you get to view a selection of eighteen images, that consist of a Cinema Poster, Black-and-White promotional photos and stills from the film. All in all this is a nice little feature, but sadly far too short.

Finally, ONE MILLION B.C. whatever its merits when one looks at it today, demonstrated Hammer Film Productions was adept at turning its hand to genres other than Gothic horror and were equally as willing to embrace science fiction, psychological drama, crime noir, comedy, swashbucklers, and epic period adventure with its customary zeal. This film also marked a turning point. A month prior to its December release Hammer Film Productions ceased operating out of its original home at Bray Studios and was, for economic reasons, obliged to use the facilities at Elstree Studio and Pinewood Studio to fulfil its contracts with distributors. While ONE MILLION B.C. inspired a run of sequels, including When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth [1970] and The Creatures the World Forgot [1971], their diminishing returns perhaps signalled the eventual decline in Hammer Film Productions output. With this 50th Anniversary release from StudioCanal, the film looks and sounds great in high-definition. The 4k restoration significantly improves the colour, contrast, and detailing, so theres an added richness in the costumes, faces, and landscapes. Granted, with the use of many processes and matte shots combining live action with animation, there are fluctuations in picture quality and film grain but thats a consequence of the processes used at the time. Overall, this restoration is a very pleasurable viewing experience and is one of my all-time favourite films of that period in time that I will treasure forever. One thing I do not understand why they supplied the inferior DVD disc, as it is a much shorter running time and of course the image quality is a poor substitute compared to the Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!

764838,3,6304017081,"We follow a hirsute blue-eyed white caveman covered in even hairier pelts as he is kicked out of one clan of brown-haired, makeup wearing swimsuit models and is adopted, and then kicked out of another clan of blonde swimsuit models.  There are cave men in each group too, though few are paired up and only about three or four people appear to be over 30.  Here and there in the course of the movie dinosaurs and other monsters appear, which everyone immediately sets to work at killing.  Usually they succeed after a short struggle..... except in a few instances where another monster appears- in which case the two monsters of course fight to the death.
There's practically no speaking at all in this movie and no recognizeable words from the characters, so if you're like me most of the time seems to be filler waiting for the next monster to turn up.  There are a number of fights for dominance among the cavemen and even a cavewoman fight, which is more like a buxom mud-wrestling match.
Although they're merciless with the dinos, thankfully in most instances the loser of the one-on-one human battles is usually spared out of what we assume to be a sense of general benignancy.  Ineviably the brown-haried and blond-haired troops meet and of course fight a war, but at the last minute an earthquake intervenes killing lots of people and monsters all around, after which everyone decides lets be friends.
I know this is a cult favorite so I'm sure my review will displease a few, but hey.  Ray Harryhausen did the special effects and the movie is worth it just to see the stop motion critters, they are very well done especially considering the time.

765112,5,6304017081,"This movie is great fun - slime and dinosaur grime abound in this story of bearded men and sexy women, with cheezy/primitive non-CG monster effects by Ray Harryhausen. What's amazing about it also is that there's no English dialogue, only some English narration at the beginning, followed by a screenplay of caveman language, amounting to exactly six given names, and around that number of nouns and verbs as well.

No matter, the story is told in rough pantomime, demonstrating squabbles between brothers, hunting, life and death. Fantastic scenery from the Canary Islands gives it an extra-primitive other-worldly feel to it.

Despite the camp and cheese, and lack of dialogue, the film moves along nicely and you get a sense of some development, tension, and plot build-up, and the battles with giant creatures are okay too. But the two highlights are definitely Raquel Welch, and the other leather-clad beauties cast in the film, and the groovy Harryhausen creatures that our tiny human actors scrabble next to. Love it!

One, the ROCK  TRIBE, are backward, violent , and live in a society where power rules and the strong prey-upon the weak.  A member of this tribe, TUMAC (John Richardson) is ejected from this tribe, and eventually finds his way into the less-violent, more civilized and affable SHELL TRIBE, where , with kind-treatment, he is taught (arguably), social-graces.  Unlike the ROCK TRIBE, who are dark-haired, the SHELL TRIBE are predominantly blonde.  Eventually, TUMAC gains the attraction of a beautiful member of this SHELL-TRIBE, LUANNA (Raquel Welch).  But, this little stone-age soap-opera notwithstanding, there is contained in this film perhaps it's real attraction----DINOSAURS !

(1940; Directed by Hal Roach Sr. & Jr.; Produced by D.W. Griffith; & starring Victor Mature, Carol Landis, and Lon Chaney Jr.).  You will need a DVD/BR player that is region free (the DVD is region 2 & NTSC encoded) for playing it.  The film runs for 80 minutes and is B&W, however it's in great watching shape considering it's age and lack of availability in the U.S.A.; which altogether makes it a pleasing find.  While this film is not in the same vein as Gentlemen's Agreement, or even the Wizard of Oz, you will find fun entertainment on multiple levels.

765559,4,6304017081,"I watched this film with genuine pleasure and I am glad that I finally discovered this great classic - even if objectively speaking this is a very silly movie. Below, more of my impressions with some very limited SPOILERS.

IMPORTANT! This is the review of the unedited British Region 2 version, lasting 96 minutes - it is longer and more complete than the Region 1 version, and if you have a possibility to view Region 2 DVDs I recommend to purchase THIS version.

This adventure film about prehistoric people doesn't even try to stick to any kind of realism - in the year 1 000 000 BC modern humans didn't exist yet and as for the sex appeal of proto-human ""Homo erectus"" chicks, well, I definitely don't even want to go there... Dinosaurs of course were also extinct in those times, already since 64 million years - and the bikini worn by Ms Welch (even if it is supposedly made in deer-skin) wouldn't appear before XXth century... But all of this has of course no importance - this is just an adventure film, having absolutely no other pretensions that to entertain.

The story is basically about an exile from one tribe of prehistoric people who finds refuge with another, more advanced tribe and obtains there a bride - actually, now that I think of it, it becomes clear that Jean-Jacques Annaud copied this general story line into his own (much better) ""Quest of fire"" film. Of course there will be some further complications, but really, the story doesn't really matter. The two things that make all the interest of this film are the chicks and the dinos.

Being a terminal screen junkie and having watched uncounted thousands of films in my life, I already saw a great lot of beautiful actresses - but few films can equal this one in which we can admire not one but TWO incredibly hot and sexy beauties: Raquel Welch as gentle Loana and Martine Beswick as bitchy hellcat Nupondi, both of them wearing little clothes. Even better, at one moment they get into a nasty catfight... Every scene in which even one of them appears is a splendor - and if you think that Raquel Welch is THE star in this film, well, wait until you see Nupondi dancing!

The dinosaurs in this film are amongst the best creations of the great Ray Harryhausen and anybody who liked his creatures in Sinbad films will be delighted to discover here the same kind of stop-motion magic.

Chicks in bikinis vs. dinos in stop motion film - can it get any better? A film without any pretension other than to give good time to its public, more suitable for watching amongst guys, with a mandatory consumption of beer a condition to appreciate it more.

The acting and Harryhausen's work in the production make it predictable but enjoyable. Note that the version I am reviewing (the R2 PAL import) is uncropped widescreen, but it is not an anamorphic transfer and is letterboxed, so it has huge black bars on the top, bottom and sides on any TV. The transfer is very good, with sharp images but the letterboxing wastes bitrate. If you use the zoom or similar control on your TV or player, the image quality degrades. It does have the interviews with Welch and Harryhausen that are apparently missing on the Region 1 NTSC disc, which sounds terrible (see the other reviews below). This is better, but far from the definitive version that its fans deserve. Since it is PAL, you will need a multistandard player to watch it on a TV in the US without converting it using software. It should play on most PCs with no conversion but will require changing the region code of your optical drive or a region-free driver (google 'Passkey').",1375228800,,1105,4.585858585858586

The best Dinosaur themed motion picture up until ""Jurassic Park."" Before you say what? I'm not including films like the original ""King Kong,"" 1950's giant monster movies, or  Japanese giant monster movies, for ""One Million Years B.C."" was a breed apart from them. Here we go back in time to show dinosaurs that actually lived. Dinosaur films are a sci-fi sub-genre on to their selves. Not a giant behemoth destroying a city. Not a giant ape running amok in New York City. These films portray, albeit fictionally, the giant monsters of the past, & ""One Million Years B.C."" is a fossilized gem!

""One Million Years B.C."" is the story of caveman Tumak, who is ostracized from his tribe by his own father & brother in a power struggle. Left hurt & alone to survive or be eaten, Tumak makes his journey across the prehistoric landscape to find another tribe, a tribe of golden haired cavemen & women, more civilized, which their golden hair is a obvious metaphor. He meets the beautiful Loana, played by stunning Raquel Welch, who has never been matched since or before when it comes to filling out a animal skin bikini! Tumak & Loana become romantically entwined, or at least as romantic as a caveman like Tumak can be, LOL, & they make their own adventure.

Filled with very little dialog & a memorable sound track, ""One Million Years B.C."" is a simple film, but executed grandly! It's a film built around the great special effects of Ray Harryhausen, who gives one of his greatest shows here! The dinosaurs are outstanding, & we get plenty of variety, Allosaurus, Brontosaurus, Triceratops, Pterodactyl, & other dinosaurs whose names escape me, both carnivorous & flying. We also get, one big bad sea turtle,  ape men, dressed up lizards, earth quakes & volcanic eruptions! If that is not enough, a rescue of Loana from the clutches of Tumak's backwards tribe, by her tribe. Yes, this is a story of survival, a story of cave boy meets cave girl, a story of two tribes, & dinosaurs aplenty, roaming & romping the country side!

Made by Hammer films in 1966, ""One Million Years B.C."" is another fine feather in the studio's cap, that has brought us great monster movies. A studio that was a big part in revitalizing not only the classic monsters, but revamping both horror & sci-fi genres for a new more sophisticated movie audience, that demanded more horror, more monsters, more fun, & all of this in glorious color. ""One Million Years B.C."" now can be looked back upon 47 long years later, as a pivotal dinosaur movie that paved the way for greater films in the future.

He (Tomack) treks across volcanic land and encounters a giant prehistoric monster ( Iguana) and a giant spider. Later he finds water in a underground cave inhabited by ape beasts. He luckily escapes and passes out near a sea shore. A group of blond hair Shell people find him. We see Raquel Welch in her scantily clad fur bikini. Raquel (Lanona) helps fix his wounds and the Shell clan bring him to their cave. Later Tomack battles and kills what appears to be an Allosaurus dinosaur that is attacking and killing the Shell people. They are very grateful and welcome him. However Tomack tries to steal a spear and is thrown out of the Shell clan. Beautiful Lanona falls in love with Tomack and follows him back to his clan.

There is a  scene of a Triceratops and a Trex fighting. Also a Brontosaurs scene and a separate giant attacking turtle scene . Lanona is attacked and taken off by a giant Pterodactyl to be fed to its young. However the Pterodactyl is attacked by another one and Lanona is dropped and makes it back to her tribe. Several members of her tribe come to help find Tomack. There is a big battle between clans but then a volcano erupts. Earthquake, lava and destruction. I won't ruin the ending for you.

Lots of exciting action in this movie. No English words. Just caveman grunts and simple caveman words.  For an actor/actress this was a movie easy to learn your lines. The special effects were great.

I would of given the movie 4 stars without Raquel Welch but with her in it... easily 5 stars. Raquel Welch exudes beautiful female sexuality in her fur bikini. INMO one of the hottest, best looking actresses of all time. Plus in other movies she proved she could act saying lines too. This movie made her a major star. Next I want to get Fantastic Voyage starring her.

One million BC a good science fiction/caveman/dino movie but with Raquel in it is easily rated 5 stars. A classic! Don't try to analyse this movie. We all know the last of the dinosaurs died out about 65 million years ago, long, long before the first primative man. Just go with the flow and enjoy the movie.

P.S.Someone told me they saw Raquel Welch (now 71) in a cooking/comedy short episode on TV. He marveled at how well she looked and still is a hotti. She obviously kept herself in good shape with diet and exercise. Way to go Raquel from a long time fan.",1327104000,9,2674,4.463114754098361
765708,3,6304017081,"I know this movie was suppose to be about cavemen, cave women and dinosaurs, but when I saw the large house lizard, and the big spider attacking the big cockroach, well, that was just too ridiculous.  Not much effort was made for any research to justify any authenticity of any realistically presumed documented facts that I am certain are recorded in the annals of archeology.

Rachel Welch, of course, looked really good.  All the girls did, but Rachel Welch definitely had a more modern designed boob-harnessed bikini top that, I can swear, sometime you can see the clasp in the back.

Rachel Welch, at her early age here, kinda looked like a cross between a fair-haired Eva Mendes, but with some facial characteristics of a younger Elizabeth Shue (Jennifer in Back To The Future II, and III).

So, of course, after I watched this rental and quickly ran it back to my outgoing mail box, I came back to watch my DVD of ""Caveman"" starring Ringo Starr and Barbra Bach.  Although Barbra Bach is beautiful, I still thought that Rachel Welch was far more beautiful and more realistic for the role.

This movie didn't seem to have much of a story, even back then when movies usually focused on making good stories.  Not like today where we have so many screen-consuming special effects that it's hard top follow the underlying intended story.",1324944000,2,1338,4.737068965517241

765711,3,6304017081,"When I first saw this film in its initial US release
in 1966 (at a drive-in!) I was only seven years old.
Needless to say, for me, it was all about the dinosaurs.
As I came back to the film over the years, via its many
theatrical re-releases, it became about the dinosaurs
and - yes - Raquel Welch in her famous fur bikini.
Since then, it has become about Hammer Films, effects
master Ray Harryhausen, composer Mario Nascimbene,
and several world-class British character actors having
what-appears-to-be the time of their lives covorting
around in fur costumes and barking out unintelligable
dialogue.  What is there not to like about this film?
Well, the dvd for starters.  Yes, it's the standard
US release version, albeit badly cropped. But having
seen the original uncut British Pathe version, this
one frankly no longer cuts it for me.  Nine minutes
of footage was excised by 20th Century Fox for its
US release, much of it involving Harryhausen's work,
not to mention actress Martine Beswick's sexually
provocative cave dance and a gruesome decapitation
among some cannibal ape-men in a watering hole.
That's the version that desperately needs to be
made available in this country.  Trust me, if you
adore this film as much as I do (and I must have
seen it one million times) it'll be worth the wait.",1278806400,5,1306,4.791111111111111

The smartest thing they did with this film is not allowing anyone to talk, and I don't mean that sarcastically, I mean it works. And there is an obvious underlying theme of the development of a human conscience, within certain individuals and groups, that really works surprisingly well. It is understandable that a lot of guys will say this movie is all about a half-naked Raquel and excellent Dino effects,... and that's it. But I would say that there is no way this baby could have held up so well, all this time, with only that going for it. This movie holds up because you care about the characters and their plight. I should add that it is beautifully filmed, a vision of primordial acuity and menace..... I have seen her in 5, maybe 6 other films. I would say that this is easily the best performance I have seen by RW. I thought she really did a great job....

The girl played by Raquel Welch is in a more advanced group than others. They have better social customs and they have better spears. There is a lot of good looking girls in this blonde tribe. The men do the fighting against dangerous animals. The different groups do not have a common language. One group is really hairy and apelike. They have appalling social customs. Humans need to get their act together and share the food after killing animals. Fighting over the food is not the way. There is not much talking in this movie.

There are hardly any stone-age Cro-Magnon early human/hominid type movies out there but One Million Years BC gives a good crack at it although highly inaccurate with humans fighting dinosaurs even though they didn't coexist at the same epoch, the general theme of tribes battling for survival from two different stocks and then interbreeding is certainly very interesting (one gang are like they are Abba's descendants with their blond hair). There is some excellent stop-motion animation, not to mention this is done by Hammer who brought us Christopher Lee as Dracula. The music is very eerie and somewhat memorable with an overall sadness pervasive from start to finish, the struggle that is human life is captured well and the film ends up being a surprise hit. If you like films about ancient history then maybe for all its short-comings One Million Years BC is one of the more interesting ones you can see.",1237766400,,1039,4.842696629213483
765770,3,6304017081,"One Million Years B.C. (1966) When Hammer Films produced their remake of the 1940 prehistoric drama One Million B.C. they decided to add a couple of spectacular features to guarantee audience interest. Of course, I'm not referring to the Ray Harryhausen special effects or the sumptuous Canary Island locations, but instead the visual of Raquel Welch in a fur bikini. (And yes I went there!) While the details may not be totally authentic (people and dinosaurs in the same time period; Raquel's false eyelashes) this is an entertaining movie, doing a slight twist on the ol' Romeo and Juliet plot: he (John Richardson) is Tumak, from the savage Rock Tribe; she (Welch) is Loana, from the more peaceful Shell Tribe. The Rocks and the Shells don't get along, dinosaurs attack, and eventually a nearby volcano erupts for a fiery climax. Interestingly, this is played out without English dialogue, with only a few grunted words and names to supplement the visuals. Harryhausen supplies his usual splendid stop motion beasties, though a real iguana and tarantula make it in as enlarged ""dinosaurs"" too. The cast plays it very straight, though I would love to see the bloopers as there had to be some giggles and breakups over the actions and grunting they were performing. Welch is absolutely iconic in costume, with one particular publicity photo serving as the movie's poster, a separate poster, and the illustration used nearly every time this movie is mentioned in a reference book or magazine. However, it must be mentioned that Martine Beswicke (Thunderball) is in support here as a particularly wild member of the Rock Tribe and though she's never been less than beautiful in any movie I've seen her in, she is at the absolute peak of her pulchritude in this movie. In fact, though I would think the producers meant for Welch to stand out far above all of her castmates in the looks department, I'm afraid this particular viewer would say that Martine walks away with the Hottest trophy. But maybe that's just me. In any case, this movie gets a solid recommendation, so check it out!",1229731200,2,2085,4.892655367231638
765771,5,6304017081,"This movie is without a doubt the most accurate portrayal of early human civilization I have ever seen. When I think of all the thousands of dollars I wasted on a solid education, I get mad at the fact that all I had to do was spend about 6.99 plus shipping and handling, and I'll get the best history lesson of all.

The movie is all about the hardship our great grandparents had to endure. Giant iguanas, giant sea turtles, and did I mention giant iguanas? I get the pure satisfaction knowing that I come from a long line of giant iguana fighters. It's safe to know that embedded in my dna is the ability to fight large iguanas. But that's not all our great grandparents had to endure. No sir. In fact, every day men had to go out and hunt wild bores. Then the men brought gifts of bore tooth back to their cave wives who wore bikinis and made sea shell necklaces. Little did I know men soon realize hey, instead of using sticks why not put sharp pointing rocks at the end to actually pierce things. After soon discovering this, our great grandparents followed bikini women to swim in a lake only to be captured by a giant dinosaur bird. But that's not all the hardship our great grandmothers had to face. No sir, they had every day disputes which includes someone else touching the other girl's bore tooth and then getting in a hot, sweaty bikini fight for all to watch. We learn that our great grandparents survived in an ever changing world where volcano explodes and people stabbing people and picking up their hot wives in bikini. It appears our grandparents celebrated marriage by picking up their bikini wives and hauling them around like luggage. But that's not all, our grand parents learned that fighting is not an acceptable way of life. I mean when women are running around in bikinis, all the fighting just isn't worth it.",1229644800,10,1837,4.5

I already knew about Gwangi, and watched it first. I loved it. But I was unsure about One million years BC. It looked and sounded like a rip off of Quest for fire (another good caveman film) and I doubted there'd be much claymation, because if it was anything like Quest for fire, it would be serious and realistic, without any corny FX.
So I popped it in the DVD player, and began watching. And my eyes were instantly glued to the screen. There were TONS of claymation scenes (all wonderful) and even a giant Iguana! And Raquel Welch was also a fine cave woman (although she didn't resemble any of the gruff dirty cave men) but it was pleasing non-the-less.

Those are amazing, considering computers weren't even in use then. I'm still floored by their ability to do some of those specials effects and look pretty convincing, given the time period.

There aren't any real words in this whole film, so in that you may be disappointed. The action is 60's type so there's really little blood. And I wasn't too happy that the violent tribe was made up of brunettes and the non-violent tribe was made up of blondes. That's really ""hairist.""

765824,1,6304017081,"This is the best cavemen-and-dinosaurs movie ever made!  The acting is superb, and, yes, there is a lot of scope for acting in this movie.  The plot isn't very subtle, but it concerns the most powerful of all dramatic themes -- survival -- and it is utterly gripping.  The scenery is magnificent, and magnificently filmed.  The animation by Ray Harryhausen is brilliant and realistic.  The score by Mario Nascimbene is awe-inspiring and perfectly appropriate to the action.  No, the movie is not scientifically accurate, but that doesn't matter.  The movie is fantasy, and should be viewed as a picture, not of the world we live in as it was long ago, but of another world, which might have existed if things had gone differently.

There are some people who laugh at the scene where Tumak is chased by the giant blue iguana, but Ray Harryhausen may have the last laugh, as this is the most realistic part of the movie.  In Australia 50,000 years ago, there really were gigantic carnivorous lizards, and there can be no doubt that on some occasions they really did chase down, kill, and eat the ancestors of the Australian aborigines.  The lizard is called Megalania today, and it was 30 feet long and 7 feet high in the middle of the back.  Its small relative the Komodo dragon is a known man-eater.  Of course, Megalania did not look exactly like an iguana, and the shot would have been more realistic with a real Komodo dragon, but a real Komodo dragon would try to eat the cast and crew, and its bite is almost as dangerous as a cobra's.  In addition to venom glands which run the whole length of its lower jaw, it harbors a host of nasty bacteria in its mouth.  One of these is Yersinia Multocida, which translates roughly as ""the bubonic plague relative that kills everything"".  Iguanas are harmless.

By now you're wondering why I gave the movie one star instead of five.

A close comparison between the DVD version (Region 1) and a full-screen version shown on television reveals that, contrary to the advertising, this is not a widescreen version of the movie.  It was made by cutting off the top and bottom of the fullscreen version.

Nor was it made by a careful pan-and-scan process, like the one used to convert movies filmed in Cinemascope into fullscreen versions for television, which tries to ensure that the most important parts of the picture remain centered on the visible screen.  Instead, they seem to have cut off the same parts of the picture without regard to what was being shown.  Heads and legs of people and dinosaurs are cut off.  Spectacular mountain peaks are cut off, leaving a dull brown scene without distinguishing landmarks.  In extreme close-ups, people's foreheads and chins are cut off.

If they had advertised this version as a fullscreen version cut down to fit a widescreen TV, that would be truthful and I would have no complaint.  But to advertise it as a ""widescreen"" version, ""preserving the original theatrical aspect ratio"", is deceptive and misleading.",1221868800,120,3001,4.758220502901354

He evenually gets cast out of that clan he, then, takes Welch and goes back to his own. He finds his brother had tried to kill the leader (their father), made him blind and lame, and has now taken over the clan. Welch goes back to her clan and gets help as there is about to be a battle. When the final battle starts, an earthquake rips up the land killing many from both sides. After all is over, the blond and black haired people join to form one clan.

There is even a huge sea turtle that is supposed to be scary, but... well, falls short of the mark.

Worse (if at all possible) : top and bottom of screen missing entirely, which is made all the worse yet by the bonus about the restoration process, that compares an admittedly badly scratched but full screen 1993 film version with the truncated 1996 laserdisc version used for this DVD (as regards the 2002 ""restored film version"" and ""restored video version"", I can see absolutely no difference between the two). And to make things complete and irrevocable, there is a bad technical problem : on my player and projector at least, I keep getting blurred lines every couple of frames (every time someone moves, actually...). What is ""better"" about this version, then ? Well, maybe the fact that you get a couple more languages and a lot of subtitles for the 3 or 4 only sentences of the film (at the very beginning) - including the ""English for hearing impaired"" that is actually quite fun : ""HISSES"", ""ROAR"", that kind of thing all the time !

This thing is absloutly horrid and the only two redeeming things are the Harryhausen animations and Ms. Welch in that furry bikini of hers.  Personally I find it amazing that cavewomen could keep their hair so clean and styled here but that's just me.  Now as to the best time to view it?  Best when under the influence of a pint of fine whiskey and in the company of good friends that want something to make fun of for a short period of time.",1127779200,7,558,4.4950495049504955
765868,3,6304017081,"...You can see the reasons Raquel Welch became a star. The leather bikini probably helped a bit as well.

The film is silly and contains elements that would make any paleoentologist, anthropoligist, gelologist or chronologist cringe but that's not the point is it? The story is about a ""caveman"" from a tribe of brutal brunettes who is exiled after a conflict with his brother. In his wanderings, he finds a tribe of ""more civilized"" blondes. Raquel Welch is the one of most interest. His low brow ways are enough to get him kicked out of that tribe as well but Raquel makes a nice consolation prize. They wander about a bit, taking on the native fauna and eventually meet up with his tribe again. Buxom blondes are in short supply there so conflict is inevitable. War breaks out between the two tribes but a fortuitous volcano becomes a better peacekeeper that the guys in blue helmets ever thought about being and the survivors form a ""new tribe"".

People who enjoy Harryhousen's animation style might enjoy this example of his work. So too will anyone who just wants an opportunity to stare at Raquel's...assets. An uplifting experience, though, it is not. Perhaps the best reason for viewing this movie is just to see the state of the art for 60's science fiction effects with prehistoric monsters.",1114560000,5,1302,4.782222222222222
765869,4,6304017081,"Of course man and dinosaur never co-existed. Many of the respective dinosaurs featured in this film lived in different eras. And I don't think that a ""Godzilla-sized"" turtle ever roamed the planet.

But, that withstanding, ""One Million Years, B.C."" is a science fiction/fantasy lover's delight. It features two of filmdom's biggest assets: the effects of Ray Harryhausen and the anatomical splendor of Raquel Welch.

Composer Mario Nascimbene's score is quite stunning, combining the traditional with some rather avant-garde sound effects.

Overall, the 1967 film stands as a testament to the creative wizardry of Harryhausen, a man that knows how to have fun with clay and a vivid imagination.

ADDENDUM:  There's a not-so-subtle hint of bias/racism in that the ""intelligent"" cave people are fair of skin and blonde while the more savage and ""less brainy"" ones are darker skinned and dress in black.",1109894400,4,900,5.309859154929577
765870,4,6304017081,"Although Fox uses the famous picture of Raquel Welch in her fur bikini on the cover of this DVD, the reason most people will want to watch and this 1966 movie today is because of the dinosaur stop-motion effects by Ray Harryhausen. The film, a remake of a very clunky 1940 movie, ""One Million B.C.,"" starring Victor Mature and Carol Landis, combined Harryhausen's terrific dinosaur effects with a caveman plot heavy with sexual titillation. The combination made the film a big worldwide hit (and without any dialogue in any intelligible language, it translated easily to other countries), but today the sex elements seem tame and often a bit silly. The dinosaurs still amaze; Harryhausen's effects have a sense of wonder to them that never ages. Even away from the animated effects sequences, the film still works remarkably well due to effective performances from the cast and the filmmakers' attempts to keep the story simple but serious (when possible).
""One Million Years B.C."" was the brainchild of Michael Carreras, son of James Carreras, the head of Hammer Film Productions in England. Hammer had made its name with its Technicolor gothic horror films, but Michael Carreras wanted the studio to stretch in different directions, and ""One Million Years B.C."" was one of his most successful experiments. He asked Harryhausen to provide the effects, and the effects man was loaned from his own production company, Morningside, to do the movie. This makes it one of the few films from the period that Harryhausen worked on where he was not one of the producers or involved in developing the project.
The movie was shot on the Canary Islands, a perfect setting for a prehistoric wilderness. In a fictional time where men and dinosaurs lived side-by-side (even six-year-olds know this is ridiculous), Tumak of the primitive Rock Tribe (John Richardson) is exiled from the tribe after a conflict with his brother. He travels through the wastelands until his finds the peaceful (and beautiful and blonde) Shell Tribe by the ocean. He romances the alluring Loana the Fair One (Raquel Welch, in the role that made her star), who eventually leaves with him when the Shell Tribe exiles him as well.
The story is quite simple, following our heroes across the wastes and encountering multiple deadly animals, ape men, plus getting involved in fights and tribal warfare and facing natural disasters like a volcano. There is no intelligible dialogue, only a simplistic, guttural language. A narrator at the beginning lays out the situation, then vanishes, leaving us with the pantomime story. (Strangely, the DVD is dubbed in Spanish, with a subtitle option! Since this only covers the first five minutes, you have to wonder why they bothered.) Welch and Richardson are both very good at the difficult roles, which require heavily physical acting and facial expressions. Also excellent are Robert Brown as Tumak's violent father (the same actor who played M in the 1980s James Bond movies!) and the sexy Martine Beswick (who also appeared in two James Bond films) as Tumak's first love. Yes Raquel and Martine do get into a girl fight -- the filmmakers were not going to turn THAT opportunity down.
Plenty goes on in the human scenes, with many battles and tussles, and Raquel Welch does light up the screen. Mario Nascimbene's bizarre music contributes to the drama. But when the dinosaurs are on the screen is when the film really shines.
Oddly, the first monster we see isn't a stop-motion effect at all, but blown-up footage of an iguana. Harryhausen admits this was his choice, and that it was a mistake. That said, the iguana is well matted into the footage of John Richardson. A giant spider shows up briefly, but the rest of the animals are all stop-motion: an archelon (giant sea-turtle), a briefly sited brontosaurus (originally meant to take part in a full sequence), a juvenile allosaurus that attacks the Shell People camp, a triceratops and a ceratosaurus battling each other, a pteranodon and a pteradactyl and the pteranodon's babies. All the sequences are great, but the allosaurus fights especially stands out. The nine-foot tall dinosaur moves quickly and interacts seamlessly with the human actors, and the result is an incredibly dynamic and exciting scene; the finale is a great stand up and cheer moment.
The DVD is an adequate presentation. The film has been carefully restored from poor sources (the negative is lost), so it looks fairly good, but with noticeable flaws in places. The sound is an adequate stereo. There are barely any extras: the trailers, and a brief split screen comparison of the film before and after the restoration. Considering that the DVDs of Harryhausen films released by Columbia feature interviews with him, the lack of any other special features is disappointing but sadly fairly typical of the way Fox releases its back-catalog films on DVD.
Despite some of those DVD problems, I still recommend ""One Millions Years B.C."" to any effects and fantasy film fan. It has aged much better than you would think based on those old cheesecake Raquel Welch posters. Raquel looks good, the story holds together, and man those dinosaurs will still make they day of kids of all ages, from six to one million!",1086566400,17,5240,4.996567505720824
765871,5,6304017081,"""One Million Years B.C."" is actually a serious 1966 attempt to depict life in prehistory for cavemen and women. Many reviewers complain that human beings and dinosaurs NEVER occupied the same period in prehistory, but this is merely our best present-day educated guess. Who knows? Twenty years from now we may discover evidence that people existed at the same time as dinosaurs. The fact is that we DON'T KNOW precisely what it was like for people in prehistory and never truly will; all we can do is guess based on the evidence at hand. This movie is simply a serious attempt to show what it may have been like for people IF they lived at the same time as dinosaurs. Capeesh?

I said this was a serious depiction, but there are admittedly some humorous aspects. For instance, the mullet-headed blond men of the Shell Tribe and the indoor cave sets straight out of the original Star Trek TV series.

Other than that, I can't think of anything bad to say. The location photography from the Canary Islands is awe-inspiring and Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur animation is excellent, holding up very well even to this day; take, for instance, the way the allosaur and, later, t-rex are shown breathing in their dying moments. Needless to say, great attention to detail. The movie even throws in a couple of superimposed iguanas and a tarantula.

Oh yeah, most guys understandably rave about Raquel Welch as Loana and her infamous cavegirl bikini, and she is indeed stunning, but -- believe it or not -- there are a few other female castmembers that are more beautiful due to better womanly curves, like Lisa Thomas as the blonde Sura, essentially Loana's sidekick in the Shell Tribe, and Yvonne Horner as the dark-haired Ullah of the Rock Tribe. The statuesque Martine Beswick is also on hand as Nupondi of the Rock Tribe.

I must not forget to mention the outstanding musical score; it's very fitting, very primal.

Lastly, there's no talking as we understand it; only grunting and primitive lingo. Bottom line: ""One Million Years B.C."" is enjoyable and highly recommended unless, of course, you have pompous hangups about (supposed) historical chronology.

The film runs 100 minutes.
