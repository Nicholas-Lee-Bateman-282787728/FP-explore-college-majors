8287302,5,B001CE931U,"I'll start where the movie ""The Idol"" AKA ""L' Idole"" starts. Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) moves into an apartment complex just across the hall from Zao (James Hong). Over time Zao begins to cook for Sarah because he was once a talented cook. Sarah allows Mr. Zao to cook for her after one meal. Caroline (Marie Loboda) meets Sarah and becomes frustrated that her friendship with Mr. Zao has been usurped by this frustrated actress, Sarah. Mr. Zao and Sarah grow closer together and Mr. Zao helps her in any way he can but stops short in allowing her to commit suicide. Caroline proves that age sets no bar to a woman's scorn.

The movie earns five of five stars from me for its portrayal of a new tenant and the other residents and individual desires, wants and needs that have the possibility of occurring in any community.",1234051200,,819,4.571428571428571
