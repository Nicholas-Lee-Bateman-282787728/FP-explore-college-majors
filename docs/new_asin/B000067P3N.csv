7963593,4,B000067P3N,"It took some encouragement (""Look at the screen, Socks!  Socks, look here!  A squirl!!!""), but my cat finally started watching the video on the second run-through.  She LOVES it.  I had to move a chair over to the TV stand so she could sit close enough to ""get"" the animals on the screen.
It certainly is repetative, just to warn you.  From the human perspective, I'd like to shoot whoever decided to run that exact same bird sound CONSTANTLY.  But Socks is fascinated for at least 30 minutes, then at least passingly interested for the rest of it (she sort of wanders off to watch from a distance and half snooze).  This might be because she used to be an outside cat, though.  A TV squirl just doesn't measure up to the real ones she used to chase.
In case you're wondering, the tape includes squirls & birds in the park (lots of different scenes), fish in a tank (up close), mice playing, and a big bug crawling on the screen.  They play over and over, maybe 3 or 4 times through.  You might want to mute the dang chirping bird track after a while, though.  It plays CONTINUOUSLY, no matter what creature is being shown.
One draw back: it's only about an hour long, so it won't keep your cat entertained all day while you're at work.  If they ever come out with a DVD with continuous play option, that would be better for such needs.",1074556800,13,1336,4.364372469635628
7963594,5,B000067P3N,"I read the reviews, both negative and positive, before purchasing this tape for ""my cats"".  After reading the negative reviews I did not consider their opinion because it was based on a ""human"" opinion not the reaction from their cats. The positive critics explained how entertaining it was for their feline pets.
Since I was buying this for my cats' entertainment, and not for mine, I purchased the tape and it delivered what it promised; happy kitties. They were glued to the set and totally entertained. Whether or not I personally found it entertaining doesn't matter.",1062979200,14,572,4.958333333333333
7963595,5,B000067P3N,"This video delivers the goods (to my cat at least.)  Actually has some beautiful nature shots that are interesting to human beings as well.
We all got a kick out of watching Henry, our American Shorthair, hypnotized by the images.",1026864000,4,230,4.75
7963596,5,B000067P3N,"At first I was sceptacle.  A video for cats?  I thought... at least it could make for good dinner conversation.  I never expected for it to really work and my cat to fall in love with it.  The video has a number of scenes of wildlife that my kitty was just entranced by.  He actually pawed at the television set.
I now call ""The Purrfect Video"" my cat's babysitter.  Recommended for cat owners.",1024358400,4,394,4.328767123287672
