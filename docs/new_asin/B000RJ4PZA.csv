8200953,4,B000RJ4PZA,"Greatly enjoyed the movie, as I knew it was Miroslava's last film before she comitted suicide. This Chechoeslovakian born , Mexican actress was always one of my favorites.",1269820800,3,171,5.142857142857143
8200954,1,B000RJ4PZA,"I purchased this video for a Christmas gift for my sister, and it was shipped in time, which was great.
The problem is that the video does not come with English subtitles, which it does not say in the description.
I wrote to the seller to ask if there was either a version with subtitles to exchange it for, or, if there was a way other buyers were able to get English sub-titles (SAP) to work with this video; I recieved no reply. Its been about 20 days since I wrote to the seller. Will contact again, to request a refund, but since my sister had to open the video and put it in to watch it to find out there were no subtitles, I may not be given one. That is if the seller gets back to me. Can't use this dvd, so its worthless.",1263859200,18,730,4.006849315068493
8200955,5,B000RJ4PZA,"Made in the fifties, this film still feels as topical and fresh today, and as irreverent, as it was fifty years ago. Based on a text by the great Mexican playwright Rodolfo Usigli, who was initially involved in the project until he withdrew from the project due to creative differences, Ensayo de un crimen (The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz) is a surrealist skewering of male posturing and (Mexican?) man's innate fear of women. Compare, if you will, the suave, innefectual would-be serial killer painted with humor and a light touch, with his North American cousin, Norman, the (anti)hero of Hitchcock's Psycho, dwelling in pulp suspense and popular Freudianism, and draw your own conclusions. Then go see other films by Bunuel. For further reading, read also Octavio Paz's essays in The Labyrinth of Solitude (first published in 1949, so essential reading at the time the film was made, in Mexico), especially the essay entitled ""Mexican Masks"".",1261267200,9,957,5.063291139240507
