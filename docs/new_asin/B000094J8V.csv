Yuki is starting to show signs of disappearing. the mirror card gave Sakura a message from the other cards, that they are grateful to her and will be there when she needs them. Sakura's big brother keeps on trying to tell Yuki that he knows that he is Yue, but keeps on getting stopped by ruby moon. Eriol uses the dream card to show Sakura the place where they shall meet at the end",1378339200,,543,4.132075471698113

7989174,5,B000094J8V,"As Cardcaptor Sakura nears its inevetable climax the focus shifts almost completely from the cards themselves to the intertwined and sometimes conflicting relationships of the main characters.  All except Sakura, that is, since she seems to remain oblivious to most of what's swirling around herself as the center of a LOT of the attention from the other players in this increasing mellodrama.  The main conflict has shifted to Shoran Li, who finally seems to have accepted the fact that Sakura is the one he ""really likes""; but before he can confess his feelings, he feels an obligation to first tell his adoring cousin Meilin!  The reintroduction of Meilin serves as a catharsis of sorts for Shoran who must finally admit this to someone other than Tomoyo ( who recognized it even before Shoran himself ); but also for Meilin, who is now free from her own crush; and even Tomoyo as well, who gets the job of comforting Meilin who's unknowingly in the same position as Tomoyo herself in the category of unrequited love!  The scene between the two of them over tea in Tomoyo's room is both priceless and heart-rending.

The other episodes move along the continuing conversion of Clow Cards into Sakura Cards with a little more time out for emotional comings-together: The Mirror card finally gets to atone for the trouble and injury to Touya she caused earlier; the usually-reticent Touya too, shows a softer side to himself expressing great concern over Yuki's evident weakness, fussing over Mirror to thank her for helping Sakura, and admitting to himself he doesn't like Shoran because he will be the one to eventually take Sakura away; the Dream card shows Sakura a forcast of events in the final confrontation with Eriol and his assistants; and Eriol himself begins to show apparant remorse for the ordeals he puts Sakura through.  And of course, Kero-chan continues to prove what a glutton he is - no surprise there.  My only regret with this set of episodes is that the long ride's nearly over!",1264291200,,2001,4.867647058823529
7989175,4,B000094J8V,I liked this series much better than Cardcaptors.  It made a lot more sense and all of the sub-plots were there.,1197504000,2,112,4.333333333333333
7989176,5,B000094J8V,"Cardcaptor Sakura: Vol. 16: Friends in Need contains episodes 60-63 of the long anime series about a young girl who accidentally releases some magical cards created by an ancient Chinese sorceror named Clow Reed.  Sakura must collect all the Clow Cards, with the help of Kero, guardian beast of the seal, and her school friends Tomoyo and Shaoran.  Many adventures ensue.

Friends In Need has everything: story, emotion, action, and we get to see Sakura in an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL KIMONO!  The previous two volumes were disappointing because it seemed Sakura only faced watered-down challenges once she had collected all the cards, and was converting them to Star Cards.  But now, everything is coming together.

Episode 60 - Sakura and the Precious Friend - The precious friend is Mei Lin, who has returned from Hong Kong for only one day.  Shaoran has invited her because he is going to tell her that he has feelings for Sakura.  I cried because my heart was breaking for Mei Lin.

Episode 61 - Sakura, the Card, and the Presents - It's Christmas, but we don't have a Christmas episode as such.  Sakura asks Mirror to represent her and go on an errand with Toya while she takes care of other business.  But it seems Mirror has a little crush on Sakura's big brother.

Episode 62 - Sakura and the Strange Written Fortune - Sakura dresses in kimono (KAWAIIII!!!!!!!) to visit the shrine with Touya and her Father on New Year's Day.  The custom is that you will make a wish and get a fortune for the year.  But Eriol is tending the shrine, and Sakura gets a strange fortune.  Later that night, she has a strange dream.  What does it mean?

Episode 63 - Sakura, the Pool, and the Huge Wave - Great action, as a trip to a new indoor pool turns into terror.

Extras include an art gallery.",1134432000,3,1785,4.594936708860759
