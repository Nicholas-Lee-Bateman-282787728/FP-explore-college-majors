I can say the provider that ships this from overseas did get it to me way in advance of the expected delivery date but that was the only impressive thing.  The other 2 reviews here pretty much nailed it but if you wanted to hear from that person who actually bought one, the old verified purchaser thing, then here it is.  Zombies suddenly are all over the place and you even get to see some but the rest of it is more like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage for the real story  that is as much as I can say without being accused of being a spoiler.  The cover looks like this is a dark and morbid type film with the downfall of humanity  so your inclination is, that is what youll get, and you get instead- lots of choppy interweaving of what at first seems like background stories that leave you going how did we get this part in here? and then they take over the story to the point the zombies are minimalized.  Doubtful you will see this for rental unless your local store is very progressive and more so than the usual chain store  so I have to suggest you pass on a purchase and the YouTube clips are better than the actual film ever is. So be forewarned if you plan to make a purchaseand be ready to suspend the brains normal attempts to tie in scene to situation as this jumps a lot and still it is hard pressed to make cohesive sense at the end.  If you like to collect freaky films go ahead  this IS one, but good luck showing it to a friend and then, when they give you that look -  giving them a good reason you wanted this to begin with....and again....the new Amazon format says I have to add ""20 more words""....so like the old exploitation films that say its only a movie you can say. aint much of a movie. aint much of a movie. aint much of a movie. aint much of a movie. aint much of a movie.",1393200000,,1946,4.073490813648294
8557014,2,B00ARTE154,"A new gene is invented, Gene Z108. The film opens in the middle of a zombie infestation as a woman searches for her daughter Choloe, only to be rescued by a pervert. The film then goes back 108 hours...to district 108. You are never taken back to the original scene, you have to figure out on your own when you have passed it. In this production, the zombies are fast foot draggers,

The police and criminals initially fight each other, but then come together. The film had some dark comedy moments as when the reporter sticks a mic in a woman's face and says, ""You just lost your family. How do you feel?""

The film includes F-bombs, sex, rape, and nudity including a guy chaining up women for sex, making this an oddball Chinese zombie sexploitation film. Subtitles are used.",1388448000,,777,4.542857142857143
8557015,2,B00ARTE154,"In a Taiwanese horror ""Zombie 108"" (""Z-108 qi cheng""), a SWAT team is sent out to contain the zombie outbreak in Ximending, the shopping area of Taipei city. (The film's ""108"" refers to the postal code of Wanhua District that includes Ximending area.) Things get complicated when, not knowing what is really going on, a gangster boss (Morris Rong) and his henchmen start fighting the SWAT team.

Then, both being trapped inside the building, the SWAT and gangsters join forces to fight through the zombie-ridden streets, but on the way they encounter some people more sinister than these flesh-eating undeads.

The story is certainly silly and thin, but not without potential for mindless fun. Unfortunately, trying to shock us with gores and nudities, Joe Chien's ""Zombie 108"" is at best tepid and inconsistent. This is a mess of a film that is badly scripted and amateurishly acted, with a random collection of borrowed ideas. Talented players like Dennis To (""The Legend Is Born: Ip Man"") are all wasted. With its confusing narrative and pointless ""surprises,"" ""Zombie 108"" almost becomes a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie.

Probably except some jiangshi (hopping vampire) films and TV shows made in the 1980s, ""Zombie 108"" would be the first zombie film made in Taiwan. I didn't hate the movie itself, though it often reminded me of my first Uwe Boll film experience that I would rather not remember.",1357171200,2,1397,5.038961038961039
