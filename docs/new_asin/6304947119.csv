7879905,5,6304947119,"This video is beautifully conceived and produced.  The content spans a broad spectrum of personal experiences and is peppered with comments from researchers Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Melvin Morse, and Dr. Larry Dossey.  Dannion Brinkley also makes an appearance; it's always a joy to hear him tell about his near death experiences and how they changed his life for the better.

I believe this video will give hope to those who are searching for comfort concerning the possibility of life after physical death, and be of value to those interested in the study of prayer.",1119571200,3,566,4.936842105263158
7879906,5,6304947119,"This is an excellent video on the near-death experience.  It contains actual people who have had near-death experiences.  Everyone basically has the same experience.  It is quite fascinating.  It also contains information from a scientific point of view for you skeptics out there.  It'll give you a sense of joy, peace, and confidence about death.  The process of death may be painful, but leaving the earthly/physical body is a wonderful experience.  This video will give you a sense of purpose in life.  There is an ultimate purpose for all of us here on earth, and this video goes into depth about it.  I highly recommend this video for people who are interested in near-death experiences, and also for those who are not, but are curious about the meaning of life.  Check it out!  It is well worth it.  It'll change your life for the better.  Last, but certainly not least, it contains the greatest commandment in the Bible.  Order the video to see what it is!  You won't be disappointed.",991785600,23,992,4.752941176470588
