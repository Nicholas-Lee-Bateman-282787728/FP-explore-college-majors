8180805,4,B000NQRRDY,"This is a terrific course IMHO... eleven lectures, each around a half-hour, showing how different aspects of an outer space environment are created.

In other words, a set of scenes are created where a space ship is flying through a lovingly created background of planets, stars, space gas, asteroids etc... and everything you could imagine to make the scene realistic, such as engine flames, tractor beams, laser blasts, exploding hardware fragments, flying through an asteroid belt and so on.

This is a DVD ROM, not a traditional DVD you can play on your tv... which is fine, however what prevents me from giving this a 5-star rating is the apparent age of the course. Using Maya 7, the course can only be played on older technology. My Intel Mac was a no-go... only PowerPc alas. Luckily I had an old Windows XP which I dusted down out of the closet and setup once I had tracked down a PS2 mouse/keyboard and VGA monitor (no speakers, but I plugged in some headphones.)

However, this course is well worth the effort. A total of 340 mins of Masterclass quality lecture by professionals.",1355011200,,1090,4.726315789473684
