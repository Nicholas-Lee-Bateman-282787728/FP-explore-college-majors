5053874,4,B0074AWO08,"This Awesome Science series is designed to make science fun and prove how the Bible is completely accurate. Taking a look at fantastic places in creation, the DVD points out how God the creator made it and how it wasn't over millions of years.
My children have learned that when a documentary starts with `millions of years ago', that they start saying BLAH, BLAH and cover their ears!! How nice to have a series where they don't have to do that, but instead are fed the TRUTH of God's word!
Kids learn how the canyon was formed during the global flood of Noah's time. The evidence through the 40 layers of the Canyon help scientist to learn about the animals and plants of the time.
Noah Justice is a fun loving kid, able to relate to elementary age children. My teen's thought the show was a little too basic, so it is definitely geared toward the younger set.
Not only do they visit the Grand Canyon but also Glenn Canyon Dam to learn about cavitation, a process where high velocity and high water pressure can erode through concrete and hard rock in seconds.
The study guide that accompanies the DVD includes word lists, key concepts, Fill in the blank section, true and false section, a Biblical study guide and more.
Easily watched in one sitting though you will probably want to replay it again after you have worked some through the study guide. The guide will take a little while to finish, though you can pick and choose which concepts you utilize based on the age of your children.",1336089600,,1492,4.550185873605948
5053875,4,B0074AWO08,"We love to travel. The girls grew up in car seats and we'll drive pretty much anywhere, although before we had the girls we flew. A lot. There's no way I want to navigate an airport with all the stuff that we take on vacation....but I'm digressing.

My hubby loves the Grand Canyon. Loves it. This is a man who hates hills, mountains, cliffs, narrow roads, windy roads....and yet he loves the Grand Canyon and we would love to head that way soon with the girls.

Thanks to Awesome Science we were able to travel to the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park without leaving our living room! The DVD's are narrated by Noah Justice, a 14 year old tour guide. Admittedly I wasn't sure that that my girls would be interested in the DVDs, but they loved the Grand Canyon episode and wanted to watch it over again. My hubby and I enjoyed the Yellowstone episode, since we haven't visited there yet!

Highly recommend these DVDs - can't wait to pick up the next one!",1334707200,,963,4.4602272727272725
5053876,5,B0074AWO08,"I have never been to the Grand Canyon. You're shocked, I know! It's one place that has always fascinated me and I'd love to take my kids on a trip there. But.....well funds are limited and whenever we do get to take a trip we usually head straight for the beach. So...... how can I teach my kids about such a monumental place? Well I can look up all sorts of information on it but most of it comes from a secular viewpoint and throws out lots of confusing information.

Enter.....Awesome Science: Episode 1: Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice. This isn't a book, it isn't a website, and it isn't secular! This is a 30 minute DVD program with a Christian creation theme that will teach your kids everything they want to know about the Grand Canyon. Sound boring, because let me tell you it is anything but! Noah Justice is a kid, a cool kids with an awesome hat, who is going to walk them around the Grand Canyon step by step. He gives tons of information on the Grand Canyon and example after example of the evidence to support the Biblical view.

Maybe you are thinking that your kids don't usually learn much for a DVD program. They will with this one. There is a study guide that goes right along with the DVD to reinforce the things they have learned and to help you go back over any information they may have missed. It really is fantastic. We've been breaking it down, watching it in short segments, and my kids keep begging for more!

I'd recommend this series (other titles are available) for any Biblical homeschoolers. I think it is geared to elementary aged kids although some middle school children might find the information valuable. I was very impressed with every aspect. I do wish the study guide had some simple coloring pages or something similar for PreK and K kids.

I received this DVD from New Leaf Publishing for the purpose of this review. I was not required to write a positive review and all opinions are my own.",1333843200,,1947,4.476056338028169
5053877,4,B0074AWO08,"I recently had the opportunity to review two of Master Books newest science DVDs - Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice and Explore Yellowstone with Noah Justice.

The star and commentator of each DVD is a boy named Noah Justice. The viewers travel to the various science wonders with Noah and listen as he commentates and explains why these areas are indeed wonders of science and provides scientific support for the Biblical viewpoint of each wonder.

In the Grand Canyon DVD, Noah discusses how the canyon was carved out in just days rather than millions of years as evolutionary scientists claim. He provides scientific evidence for how the layers upon layers of rock and sediment had been laid down in less than a year. All of the information provided supports the Bible's Genesis account as a literal seven-day creation process and also supports the Bible's account of a world-wide flood.

In the Yellowstone DVD, viewers travel with Noah to Wyoming to explore the national wonder of America's first national park. In this episode, Noah provides information that explains how the Geologic Column supports the world-wide flood. He talks about super-volcanoes and their part in shaping the world in post-flood days and also gives scientific support for how Yellowstone's petrified forests were formed in just a few years rather than millions of years.

I love that these videos are definitely a young-earth perspective and present a Biblical worldview. And the evidence that is presented actually makes sense and is impressive. I found the videos to be very interesting, very educational.

My six-year old did find the videos a little boring and it was a bit beyond her age, but my eight-year-old enjoyed them and learned from them.

Each video is 3o minutes long, and the videos come with a small study guide booklet. The study guide booklets contain fill-in-the-blank questions, discussion questions, and some ""digging deeper"" questions.

In addition to the two DVD titles I reviewed, there are currently four others in the series including: Explore Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest, Explore Yosemite and Zion National Parks, Explore Mt. St. Helens, and Explore John Day Fossil Beds.

This was a nice way to change up our science studies a bit. A nice change from our normal approach to our science studies.

5053878,5,B0074AWO08,"Okay, so I'm starting this review off by confessing something.

When I saw this new series of 30-minute, creation-based DVDs, I was pretty excited.  Until I saw that the first one in the series was about The Grand Canyon.  The second one, on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, sounded intriguing.  But the Grand Canyon?  Ugh.  I've read or see so much about the Grand Canyon already and I just couldn't get excited.

I knew my kids would be interested, or at least most of them. My oldest rolled his eyes.  He didn't say it, but his body language spoke volumes:  ""Really?  You expect us to watch something else about the Grand Canyon?""

The cover -- where Noah Justice looks cut-out and pasted in -- didn't inspire either of us, despite  the publisher's blurb, which commented on how Kyle Justice (Noah's dad) ""has produced video which has appeared on networks including National Geographic, ESPN, and the Outdoor Channel.""

I determined I wanted to get this review over with, so we popped in the DVD.  Thankfully, the bad attitudes were limited to my eldest and myself.  He buried his nose in a book, intending to pretty much ignore the DVD.  I kept my computer open so I could at least check Facebook statuses.

As we watched however, my son ended up setting down his book, and I closed my computer.

This video is simply fabulous.  Noah presents all kinds of information, much of which I've heard before, in an engaging style.  The film footage is phenomenal.  And things are explained in a way that is easily comprehended -- or at least it was by everyone age 7 and up in my household (my 6 year old enjoyed it but didn't quite grasp some of the content).

I learned things in this DVD.  And I really did not expect that.

I also received a study guide that turns this into something we can watch again and again, looking at different aspects each time.  The study guide is 34 jam-packed pages of vocabulary, additional information, discussion questions, and bonus activities that lead you deeper into the various topics.

This series is wonderful.

According to the website, there will be 13 DVDs in the series.  In addition to the ones I mentioned above, there is one out on Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest, and titles on Yosemite & Zion National Parks, Mt. St. Helens, and John Day Fossil Beds will be released in the fall.

Check it out.

5053879,4,B0074AWO08,"We just watched the first DVD in this new Awesome Science series and I am impressed. The first 30 minute episode of this 13 DVD series is filled with facts that help explain how the Grand Canyon lines up with Biblical history. Scripture verses are referenced throughout and it is called ""the true history book!"" The Grand Canyon is on our family list of places we would like to visit together. This isn't set up like a tourist video. Though it does include amazing scenery, the focus is on the facts. The DVD alone is a great science resource, but this included study guide makes it stand out. This 34 page paperback helps kids dig deeper with vocabulary words and activities related to the DVD. ""The Biblical Record"" points to specific Bible passages then gives discussion questions for the whole family.

5053880,4,B0074AWO08,"Science DVDs are in high demand in the Blevins' household. I am happy to report that my thirteen-year-old science phobic daughter is the biggest fan of the new series Awesome Science with Noah Justice. Noah, a fourteen-year-old homeschooler, and his family produce this great new series which introduces the evidence for Noah's flood and a Biblical timeline present in many of our own national parks and the contradictions this evidence reveals about the theory of evolution.

Explore the Grand Canyon covers a general overview of the Grand Canyon, evidence from the Colorado River, The Biblical record, the Canyon Wall, the Dunes, evidence from recent receding floodwaters, and examples from Mt. St. Helens Glenn Canyon, Cavitation and Mars.  The available study guide contains worksheets and vocabulary to go with each section of the video.  Each section of the video presents gorgeous, sweeping views of the park with narration to explain how the features of the park were formed during Noah's flood and not over the course of millions of years.  The visual impact of this video is phenomenal.  The price for a dvd is $14.99, and the price for the study guide is $3.99.

My Bottom Line: The best thing about these videos is the evidence presented which backs up the Young-Earth Creation view of Science I have been trying to teach my kids.  Any resource that provides evidence for this view (and there is a lot of evidence) is a help in our homeschool.  I realize that at some point they will need to make their own decisions, but in the meantime I am trying to make sure they understand the different view, evidence, and contradictions very clearly before they head off to college. Another very cool reason for us to own these dvds-- we will be visiting most of these parks before we move back to the midwest in a few years. So having these videos as reference before we visit the park and actually touch and feel and see the various sections of the park. That is priceless.",1331942400,,1978,4.797058823529412

My family received this DVD from New Leaf Publishing group in order to review it. My children (11, 9, and 7) were excited to get to see it--so we watched it right away :)

The DVD is basically a child (Noah Justice) giving a lesson on the Grand Canyon and it's probable formation via the Biblical Flood, while showing scenes from the Grand Canyon and models of its formation. We have watched different documentaries on the Grand Canyon before and although this one isn't as ""professionally"" made as say, something like National Geographic, it was a great look at it from a non-evolutionary viewpoint. Our family subscribes to the young-earth theory of the earth, so it was a good fit for us. We enjoyed seeing the scenes and hearing how the different layers could have been formed.

I think my only issue with the DVD was that the boy spoke a litle too fast without very good enunciation. Some things zipped right past us without us understanding what he was saying. There is a study guide with ""quizzes"" which accompanies the DVD--I think we'll have to watch the movie a few times to get all the answers, since there's so much information given very quickly. I wish the study guide had included more printed information

I would recommend this movie for people who believe in Biblical creation and a young earth. It's a good concise look at how the Grand Canyon (and all of its layers, etc) were possibly formed.

In the DVD Noah Justice will take you on a tour of what caused the formation of the Grand Canyon from the Creationist's viewpoint.  He also talks about what Evolutionists believe was the cause of the Grand Canyon.  We also received a 34 page study guide which helps to reinforce what children learn in the DVD.

My children ages 12, 10, 8 and 6 enjoyed watching this DVD.  When I discussed it with them afterward they understood how the flood could have formed the Grand Canyon and what cavitation is.  I felt this video was a great way to spark interest in the science involved in the flood and the formation of the Grand Canyon by a global flood.  The discussion questions and bonus activities will give us more ideas to pursue.

The young man who hosts the DVD is very knowledgeable about Creation Science and the location that he is exploring. He gives information from a Creation point of view while helping children to understand the evolutionist point of view and then debunking it by Biblically backing up the Creation point of view. There are lots of wonderful scenic views of the area, maps, facts, and a combination of History and Science provided. I have noticed that not all sites provide the Study Guide we received with these DVDs and those that do require that you  order them separately for an additional cost. In my opinion this it's well worth it to by the Study Guide to accompany the DVD. The Study Guides are put out by Master Books. The Study Guide breaks down to the various points of interest of the location and scientific, including vocabulary, discussion questions and bonus activities to do. We will be purchasing the rest of the series and will be looking forward to more being added in the future. It'll well be worth the investment to add them to our homeschool library.

Our children thoroughly enjoyed this production and it is always thrilling to hear the facts they regurgitate even weeks later.  If there is one thing we're always on the lookout for, it's books, videos, and other resources that give us solid scientific evidence that shows that the Biblical record of creation can be trusted as true and completely accurate.

It's a misconception that evolution-based scientists and creation-based scientists hold different evidence to ""prove"" their point.  Everyone has the same evidence; it just depends which sunglasses you are wearing.  If you are interpreting your evidence based on a preconceived notion that the earth is millions of years old, you ignore what that evidence would mean if the world is not that old.  As a creation scientist, you look at the same evidences and show how the Biblical account of Creation and the flood would account for the current state of the earth.

5053885,5,B0074AWO08,"The Awesome Science DVD series is produced by a homeschool family, and it's actually a high quality production since the dad, Kyle Justice, is an experienced videographer/producer (National Geographic, ESPN, Outdoor Channel). Episode 1, Explore the Grand Canyon, takes viewers on an adventure to the Grand Canyon, as 14-year-old Noah Justice explains the science behind the canyon's formation from a Christian perspective.

I have to admit, I was skeptical about this series at first even though I'm a Christian homeschooling parent. Our family lives in Arizona, so we've been to the Grand Canyon many times and have studied it in depth. What could a kid who doesn't even live in Arizona possibly have to tell us that we didn't already know? And what kind of authority could a young teenager have that would make us want to listen to him as a tour guide?

Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice caught my attention from the very beginning and kept me interested right up until the very end! The program was obviously carefully researched and scripted. Noah does a great job as the narrator, and it really does sound like he knows what he's talking about. My 12- and 17-year-old sons liked it too, and could easily relate to the teen host. In fact, 12-year-old Joshua exclaimed ""This really IS awesome!""

If you like Dave Stotts' Drive Thru History series, you will like Noah Justice's Awesome Science series, because they both have the same fast-paced style. It's amazing how much information they manage to fit into a 30-minute episode. It's like going on a virtual educational field trip complete with video footage, photos, maps and graphics - not to mention spectacular scenery! We have lots of videos and books about the Grand Canyon, but Explore the Grand Canyon is my new favorite resource.

Explore the Grand Canyon convincingly covers the formation of the Grand Canyon from a young earth creation perspective. For those who aren't already familiar with the geology of the Grand Canyon, this program will be eye-opening and fascinating to watch; and for those who already have some background in this subject, it provides a thorough overview that is sure to include a few facts which you didn't know or had forgotten.

The science in this DVD is accurate and up-to-date. The Grand Canyon visitor center still stubbornly showcases the ""millions of years"" theory; however, modern secular scientists are re-examining the evidence and finally coming to similar conclusions as creation scientists. In fact, the lake overflow theory shown in Explore the Grand Canyon is basically the same as what my oldest son recently learned in a physical geography class at the local community college.

Explore the Grand Canyon can be enjoyed as is, or used with its companion workbook&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Explore-the-Grand-Canyon-with-Noah-Justice-Study-Guide/dp/0890516545/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice Study Guide</a>&nbsp;(available separately) to turn it into a complete unit study. If you're planning a trip to Grand Canyon National Park, be sure to buy the DVD ahead of time as preparation for your visit. The whole family will learn a lot from it, and when you get there you will have a better understanding of what you're looking at.

5053886,5,B0074AWO08,"Many people automatically disregard the Grand Canyon's formation as a result of a catastrophic worldwide flood in favor of the slow process of river erosion over millions of years.  This is because they prescribe to the philosophy of ""the present holding the key to the past.""

But, using examples of Empirical Science seen at Mt. St. Helens and Glen Canyon Dam in recent years, even non-believers can see the evidence supporting a worldwide flood.

Join 14 year old, homeschooled, Noah Justice in Explore the  Grand Canyon which takes you through the evidence  supporting and defending a Biblical worldview of a worldwide, catastrophic flood.  Some of these evidences include:  Angle (slope) of sand dunes, bent rock layers without fractures, absence of burrowing animals between rock layers and the irony of a large flood carving the canyons on Mars.

Back when I studied the Grand Canyon in college, I didn't get the whole idea of an ocean flooding this area and then receding multiple times over millions of years in order to leave behind the fossil layering we presently see.  However, a catastrophic flood clearly explains this.  This very well done, illustrated 30 minute video does a great job explaining this concept and others including the presence of the SAME rock layers in North America, Europe and Asia!

I recommend the study guide that is also available.  It's a great tool that has general knowledge about the Grand Canyon, bonus activities, sections specifically on the Colorado River, Canyon Walls, Dunes, The Great Flood and the receding waters plus much more.

I really like the discussion questions throughout the guide.  For  example, ""Why do secular scientists choose to believe so quickly that the canyons on Mars were possibly formed by mega-floods without the huge amount of water to be found, yet they don't think the same sort of event caused the formation of the Grand Canyon?""

The Awesome Science Series is one that should be in every home library.  All ages will benefit from the explanations, illustrations and spectacular scenery within.

5053887,4,B0074AWO08,"I was recently given the chance to watch and review Awesome Science: Explore Yellowstone and Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon. These DVDs approach science from a Biblical worldview and share how these natural wonders align with an accurate reading of the Bible.

Modern science would have you to believe that natural wonders like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone needed millions to form, but the Bible tells a different story.  Noah Justice, the narrator of these DVDs explains how an event like the great flood of Genesis 7 would be able to cause such disturbance as to form these amazing sights.

I love how the DVDs are completely set on the accuracy of Scripture.  They state that they use the Bible as their history guideline, which is rare to find and perfect for teaching your children science from a Creationist viewpoint.  I also appreciate the amount of information contained in these DVDs.  I can honestly (and somewhat shamefully) say that I knew very little about the Grand Canyon, and absolutely nothing about Yellowstone before watching these DVDs and now I know much more =)  There is so much information that I think anyone would have to watch them more than once to digest all of it.

The only thing I do not like about these DVDs is that they sound pretty much like a textbook (but with decent narration) put to pictures.  It is info and data galore, jam packed into 30 minutes.  I appreciate that it is short and to the point, but it would be nice to be able to sit an absorb the info before moving onto the next point.

I definitely would recommend these resources to any family wanting to learn more about the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, I just probably would want to also use a medium other than DVD as well, so that your child would be able to slow down and absorb the great info that is presented here!  If you plan on studying these subjects with your children this coming year, definitely check the Awesome Science series out as an addition to your curriculum!",1338249600,,1997,4.642045454545454

Noah Justice is your tour guide in the videos. He will talk about how the Grand Canyon was carved out in just days rather than millions of years as evolutionary scientists claim. In Exploring Yellowstone you will see how the scientific evidence points toward the Geologic Column being created by Global Flood of Noah's days and much more.

You will see the scientific evidence for how the layers upon layers of rock and sediment had been laid down in less than a year. All of the information provided supports the Bible's Genesis account as a literal seven-day creation process and also supports the Bible's account of a world-wide flood.

Noah shows how the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time and not over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.

Noah will show you the super-volcanoes of Yellowstone and their part in shaping the world in post-flood days and also gives scientific support for how Yellowstone's petrified forests were formed in just a few years rather than millions of years.

Each video is 30 minutes long. Noah is fun,energetic and his enthusiastic is contagious. Noah makes the learning fun. The scenery makes you want to pack up your bags and head out to the parks. Your kids will absolutely love it.
Come and join Noah as he tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly with the biblical account of the flood and also with a young earth creationist worldview.

 I was given the study guide to look through and review. I would say this is more suited for older kids/teens. I also feel that you can adjust it easily enough for younger kids without to much hassle. The study guide that accompanies the DVD includes word lists, key concepts, Fill in the blank section, true and false section, and a Biblical study guide and much more. The questions are centered around the movie and the guide is well thought out and a good companion for the DVD series.

My only complaint is the size of the book. As a homeschooler with many books I would of loved to see a larger book so it doesn't get lost in my books. If not a full size then some way to fit inside the video DVD case. The DVD is $14.99 and the Study Guide $3.99.

Produced by Kyle Justice who has worked for the likes of National Geographic, ESPN, and The Outdoors Channel, this series, Noah tours many of the world's most famous geological sites and shows how their origins line up perfectly well with a young earth creationist worldview.

Each thirty minute video contains information weaving biblical account with scientific observations to show that so many of the things that secular scientists would have you believe couldn't possibly happen within a 6,000 year earth age time frame, actually fit in quite well with Scripture.

They are not at all dry and are packed with tons of educational information in a light and informative way!  Noah, the young host, is personable and articulate but has a personality that children will find easy to watch.  He lays out information comparing secular scientists views against biblical account and shows how even the fossil layers were created rapidly during the global flood of Noah's time rather than over millions and millions of years as evolutionists believe.

In the first episode, Explore the Grand Canyon, you can learn:

-how the Grand Canyon was not eroded by the Colorado River over millions of years, but was the product of the waters that covered the earth during the flood

-how the sedimentary layers of the Canyon show that they were laid down in far less time than modern day scientists tell us

- how the moving continents contributed to the formation of inland lakes, valleys, canyons, mountains, etc. so that the post-flood world looked entirely different than it had before

-how many secular claims can be disproved using science and the Bible.

The scenery in the video is breathtaking and there are scripture references posted across the screen when applicable so that you can take notes and go search your Bible after viewing. Study guides are available if you would like to expand the use of them from supplements to actual curriculum or to just further discussion with your family about how we can confirm the biblical historical record by closely examining the world around us.",1337817600,,2240,5.027027027027027
5053891,4,B0074AWO08,"My kids and I snuggled down on the couch together to watch this 30 minute DVD hosted by Noah Justice. He did a great job and was very energetic and enthusiastic. The pictures included in this movie were beautiful to see and I enjoyed my trip to the Grand Canyon.

I was also supplied with the study guide to look through. I would say this is more suited for older kids/teens, more-so than my 11 and 9 year olds. The questions inside pertained to the movie and were good, but I think that it would be difficult for younger kids to recall all of the factual information presented in the video. It would be harder to go back and find the answers if you had missed them while watching.

Overall, I think this was a very interesting movie and a lot of factual evidence is presented regarding the making of the Grand Canyon and how it came to be. Many scientists nowadays are reconsidering their original premise that it had undergone erosion for thousands of years and now believe it was formed in a quick catastrophic process. I definitely think that it will give the viewer a lot to think about and possibly do more research on in order to form their own opinion.

Master Books sent me the above book for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the book. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Master Books.",1337731200,,1342,4.425101214574899

I was recently given the awesome opportunity to review a very cool DVD with my son, ""Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice"", from New Leaf Publishers. This DVD is in a series with some others, that are just as educational and entertaining! My son is 14 and really enjoyed watching it. It was very refreshing to have a Biblical worldview perspective on how the creation of the Grand Canyon took place.

""In this episode, you will learn some cool things such as how the `Grand Canyon' was cut in just a few short days, due to it's massive layers showing evidence that it was laid down in less than a year. The Biblical record can be trusted as the Earth's history book!""

This DVD and the others in the series would be perfect for homeschoolers, or just plain entertaining to learn some things you may not of already knew!

8509679,4,B0074AWO08,"This is an interesting movie.  I like how it portrays the Biblical truth vs. what evolutionists believe.  However, at times I did have a difficult time following along since the host seemed to change from what creationists believe compared to evolutionists.  I was somewhat distracted though with another matter while watching it with my son, so that may have been the reason for some difficulty following along on my part.  Over all, I think it's a good resource for someone who desires to know or teach their child/ren from a Christian viewpoint.",1416009600,,548,4.923913043478261

8509681,5,B0074AWO08,My children enjoy this DVD on the Grand Canyon.  The bloopers are funny too.  We are going to buy the other DVDs in this series.,1389657600,,128,4.08
8509682,4,B0074AWO08,"Positive Elements:
  The film was extremely informative, thorough, and concise.  I enjoyed the simplistic and clear way in which the facts were displayed.  It made one wonder how anyone could argue with such logical data pointing towards the evidence of Creationism.
  The upbeat and exciting narration as well as beautiful landscape film shots, made this film engaging and easy to follow. The cinematography and special effects were excellent.
  I loved how the Bible is portrayed as foundational; the Word of God, infallible and fully trustworthy in all things-- including science.  It was truly encouraging and refreshing to hear such solid Christianity coupled with and complimenting science, as it should be!

Negative Elements:
A few of the film shots and audio clips lacked some quality.  At times the film was so fast paced it took me a moment to figure out what was going on.

Offensive Content:
None.

Comments:
What a blessing it is to have such resources as this DVD, revealing the truth of Creation- the evidence of a Grand Designer.  I enjoyed having this to show my younger siblings, to strengthen our faith together as we dig deeper into the knowledge of our Father's World, and learn more of the grand design which He has laid out!

8509683,4,B0074AWO08,"Are you frustrated with the lack of science material for your children, whether it be to supplement their public education, family night videos, or to use with other homeschooling curriculum? New Leaf Publishing has released a series that presents Earth science that is soundly based on the authority of the Bible.  Fourteen year old, Noah Justice presents evidence of a global flood and shows the consistency of rock layers that have been laid down quickly rather than over millions of years. He utilizes very sound reasoning in presenting the argument for a young earth and how the Biblical global flood evidences a catastrophic event in the history of the earth. The most important thing I found in this series is the logical connection that is made between the earth science being presented from a Biblical viewpoint and the Gospel message.",1363824000,,844,5.0285714285714285

8509685,5,B0074AWO08,"I received this dvd to review months ago and thought I may have already shared here, but couldn't find my review. So here goes!

This is one of 3 Awesome Science dvds I've had the pleasure to receive to review. All opinions are my own. This one has been my favorite.

I have nothing negative to say about the great quality images this team has put together and I love love love that we bible believers have an educative, informative source expounding on the scientific proofs of - creation! We already knew that the bible is true, that God cannot lie and that science actually backs up the bible! Awesome Science has pulled it together into a quality learning experience for our older children.

I would love to have all the Awesome Science dvds. I think there are 6 now. I have 3 of them.

Since I homeschool my boys I may use each of these to create a unity study that covers as many educational bases as possible: tying in science, the bible, writing, researching (reading), etc.. If you are creative you don't even have to buy a whole science curriculum, you can make your own off great sources like these Awe. Sci. dvds.",1359072000,,1125,4.4731707317073175
8509686,5,B0074AWO08,We have used most of these DVD's in our homeschool. It's a wonderful resource for any family who is interested in scientific information based on Creation instead of the evolutionary theory. Our family has enjoyed each of these videos and we consider them to a valuable part of our homeschool. They are fun and interesting for the whole family to enjoy.,1358985600,,353,4.80327868852459
8509687,5,B0074AWO08,"Our family loves science, so any time I am able to review a science book or DVD, I get all excited.  Especially if it helps to teach about God and his creations!  I could not wait until we received the Awesome Science DVD in the mail.  I don't know who was more excited, me or my kids!

Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice is the first DVD in a series that is produced by a homeschool family.  Noah, who is the host, is 14 years old and is exploring the many many layers of the Grand Canyon.  Noah and his family are teaching us how earth science  supports the biblical record.

The DVD is 30 minutes long and will teach you how the Grand Canyon was made in just days, not millions of years and how the Bible can be trusted as the Earth's history book.  It also will show you how the many layers were made in less than a year's time.

The DVD comes with a study guide and workbook that covers what you have learned in the DVD, to help reinforce what is taught in the DVD.  The study guide has a lot of fill in the blank and True/False questions.  It also has bonus activities that you can do.

Now that you know a little bit about the DVD, let me tell you what my kids and I think about it.  WE LOVED IT!!  The DVD is very well made.  It has a lot of beautiful scenery and the information that they provide is wonderful!  Noah Justice is an excellent host that will hold your attention from the beginning, all the way to the end.  My children who are 15, 8 and almost 7, watched the whole DVD without getting up once.  What I really loved about Awesome Science: Explore the Grand Canyon?  It was so interesting that my kids kept wanting to learn more about the Grand Canyon once the DVD was over with!  The kids told their dad about the DVD and now they are wanting to take a trip to visit the Grand Canyon!

I am so excited about this DVD series.  There are 13 in all.  I know this series will become a favorite in our household.  I highly recommend that you check it out!

8509688,5,B0074AWO08,"Science is one of those subjects that some people love, but some people hate. I don't know anyone who just thought science was ""okay"". You either really enjoyed that class in school, or you thought it was totally boring or technical or...you know. I started out really hating science, but when I reached early teens, I started actually enjoying it. Because of that, I like finding books and curriculum that will encourage a love of science in children.

I was able to review a dvd in the Awesome Science series called Explore the Grand Canyon with Noah Justice. This is the first in the series, and is produced by a homeschooling family. The dvd series is hosted by Noah Justice, a 14 year old who takes you and your children on an educational adventure in each dvd. This dvd is designed with children in mind, and keeps their attention quite easily. I turned it on one afternoon, and the children really enjoyed learning about the Grand Canyon, and how it is actually proof of a great disaster (namely, a worldwide flood) rather than proof of evolution. The scenery is beautiful as well, with stunning shots of the Grand Canyon. After watching the dvd, I actually passed this on to a friend with 3 boys, and I am sure they will enjoy learning with Noah Justice as well!

I loved how clear and easy-to-understand the program was for youngsters. Noah makes the information fun and memorable, so your children really are learning while enjoying as well. The only thing I would say needs some work is that Noah seems to be trying too hard. Rather than just talking, he tries to make each sentence-almost each word-dramatic. It's not so bad that I won't watch anymore (I've already seen the second dvd, and I'm looking forward to more) but it is something that even the 11 year old commented on while viewing. Otherwise, though, this is a great series that your children will love!",1346889600,,1877,4.650602409638554
