As to the movie, it wasn't the best I've ever seen, but I watched it -
and our oldest grandson thought it was good. Bought it at Amazon.

4327747,1,B004CKCOFS,"I approached this movie with extremely low expectations which I thought might help me enjoy at least some aspect of this movie. I was wrong unfortunately and it cost me. I have been reading the Eragon books by Christopher Paolini and love them. So naturally I wanted to watch a movie about dragons. This is 1 of 3 movies in my entire life I couldn't make ii through the whole movie. I watch at least 2 movies a day (at least). So to say it is uncommon or rare is an understatement for me to give a movie 1 star and not finish it completely. I am sorry to be harsh but between the acting, the ""boat"" on wheels and the computer ""attempted"" to create a dragon, all of those areas felled miserable. So if you are thinking to yourself I really just want to see a movie with dragons, don't. Look elsewhere (although there really many out there). If I had the money and team I would create a movie about dragons because there are very few and the few they are aren't that great. Anyways, do what you want but I figured I had to warn someone.",1345766400,6,1034,4.201005025125628
4327748,2,B004CKCOFS,"I can't believe an actor like Danny Glover would lower himself to act in this piece of tripe.  Not the least exciting, scary; acting was deplorable, and found myself rooting for the dragons.  Don't waste your time or money.",1344470400,,223,4.6923076923076925
4327749,3,B004CKCOFS,"Considering the fact that I love anything dragon-related, I was curious about Age of Dragons. Not only that but I've always been a fan of Danny Glover so that was another plus. Little did I know that Age of Dragons is, actually, a reworking of the classic tale, Moby Dick.

Long story short,..Ishmael Sevier is a hunter who has hunted every animal in the world except for one. He joins the crew of Ahab, with his friend:Queequeg, in an attempt to hunt down and kill a dragon. What is supposed to be a simple hunt for the crew and Ishmael is something different, altogether, for Ahab.

Low-budget aside, Age of Dragons is a well-acted and entertaining movie. While I do recommend this movie for those who enjoy fantasy movies, I do have a qualm, however. I really don't understand why Director Ryan Little went with retelling the story of Moby Dick but with a dragon instead. Why not make Age of Dragons into a story all its' own and make it a tale of revenge? I'm sure, at the time of its' inception, Little thought it was a great idea. Thinking about it, it does seem like a great idea but, honestly, it seems rather odd when putting it to film. If you look at this movie for what its' worth(a Sy-fy original, B-movie); it is pretty decent. Not one of Glover's best...but, certainly, not one of his worst.

Overall, in my opinion, it's a pleasant movie that you'll get some enjoyment from...even if it is a little odd that it's retelling the tale of Moby Dick but with a dragon.",1344297600,,1479,4.450184501845018

4327751,3,B004CKCOFS,"""Only one man will live to tell the tale of Ahab, one man only."" Ishmael (Sevier) is a hunter. He has hunted every animal in the world except one. He decides to join the crew of Ahab (Glover) in an effort to hunt down and kill a dragon. The crew signed on for just a simple hunt that will net them a lot of money but Ahab has a different reason. I have to admit something first. I am 33 and have never read (or even seen a movie) Moby Dick. I know the basic story but none of the specifics. Going in to this one I was expecting much lameness mainly because of the fact that this is retelling of Moby Dick with dragons instead of whales. I thought how could this be good, and it seemed like a SYFY channel movie. Based on those expectations I have to admit that I was actually pretty surprised at how entertained I was by this. This is a definate B movie with a decent cast but it really sucked me in and I was enjoying myself the entire time. Fans of the real Moby Dick may be turned off by this, but I actually enjoyed this. Overall, a low budget SYFY channel-esqe movie but surprisingly entertaining. I can't believe it but...I give it a B.",1339632000,2,1142,4.102678571428571
4327752,1,B004CKCOFS,"Some ideas are great on paper, not so in practice, and ""Age of the Dragons"" is one of such examples. The fantasy adventure film is a re-imagined version of ""Moby-Dick,"" a classic novel of Herman Melville. Looking for the legendary white dragon, Danny Glover's vengeful captain Ahab leads the dragon hunters including Ishmael (Corey Sevier), Queequeg (John Kepa Kruse) Stubb (Vinnie Jones) and Starbuck (David Morgan) in a landship named the Pequod.

The film is set in a fictional mythical land that looks like medieval Europe, though some part of the film (design of the landship, for instance) reminds us of the steampunk world. Dragons are hunted, it is explained, for vitriol, a highly sought-after energy source. The hunters enter deep into the woods and wilderness to kill the flying dragons, and spend most of the time ... talking, talking and talking.

Turning a Herman Melville novel into an action fantasy is not a bad idea. For this kind of fantasy film to succeed, however, you need characters you can relate to, or at least decent action sequences. Sorry, but ""Age of the Dragons"" has none of them. You have to wait about 30 minutes for the first combat scene to start. Those action scenes, poorly shot and edited, are not thrilling.

As to the actors, it seems only Vinnie Jones (second-billed) knows what he is doing. Unfortunately, his role is a pretty small one. Captain Ahab has a daughter Rachel (Sofia Pernas), love interest for Ishmael. Her pointless role does not help.

In short, the film is terrible. By saying terrible, I'm not talking about the idea of re-imaging a classic novel. ""Age of the Dragon"" is dull. It needs better acting and more budget.",1333584000,6,1675,4.846153846153846

4327760,1,B004CKCOFS,"Glover hammed it up through the movie - it got tiring. Shouting is not acting. This could have been a good movie with a better director, better writing, and someone who played Ahab straight.  Or maybe not.",1401148800,,205,4.54054054054054

4327762,4,B004CKCOFS,"You know how sometimes you want to give something zero stars, but Amazon won't let you?  I'm sure you know the feeling.  Well in this case I want to give the movie 1 Star and 5 Stars, but at the same time.

Pros:
1. Acting: Vinne Jones and Danny Glover are both pros. Vinnie did what he had to to make an honest dollar. Danny threw himself into the part and kept throwing. He was Shakespearean in delivery of his lines--like his character Ahab, he works in his own world. The other leads were a little less ""energetic"" in their delivery which make Glover stand out a bit too much.  Queequeg's job was mainly to seem fierce and that didn't quite work.  The love interest, Ahab's adopted daughter, played by Sophia Pernas, showed some potential and is a model--and she did that well.
2. Script: The script was well written.  Very literate and faithful to Melville's tone, though not to the story.  The tension between man and God could be felt, though nothing comes of it.
3. Tone: The movie takes itself seriously which is a plus. It could have gone Campy, and made a different movie.
4. Photography: The photography is first rate with great nature scenes. The movie was filled in Utah.

Cons:
1. The basic premise is weak but could be accepted. When I found out that a lumbering steam-powered conestoga wagon/battle jitney was the ""ship"" my heart sank.
2. The script balks.  Leads us to believe that at least we are going to prob some deeper issues, but doesn't deliver.  And given that there is more talk than action, that is a major weakness.

Bottom line: If you aren't expecting too much and want to kill a Saturday afternoon, there are worse ways to do it.",1380153600,7,1661,4.503333333333333

4327764,4,B004CKCOFS,Good Dragon show. It will keep you intertained if you like this kind of show. There is a long line of these movies and this is as good as the rest. So don't miss ths one.,1376006400,2,170,3.75
4327765,1,B004CKCOFS,"You know how sometimes you wonder how a film ever came to be made? How it ever survived the tenuous and tortuous gestation period through which commercially produced motion pictures go?

How, given it must have cost millions of dollars, occupied fully the professional lives of several dozen people for maybe six months or a year (not just the actors and director but countless cameramen, make-up artists, costume designers, scriptwriters, set builders, compositors, special effects guys, key grips, best boys and so on) that someone had enough energy and a sufficiently plausible straight face to persuade all those people, and their financiers, of its fundamental worthwhileness to even be made?

Age of Dragons - surely to Herman Melville what Rick Wakeman's Camelot On Ice was to Thomas Mallory - is one of those films. It's difficult to see how that bubble-bursting, Emperor's-nudity-identifying moment didn't come mid-way through the pitch, or even earlier, during the (presumably drunken) bar-room conversation in which young, dim scriptwriter seizes on the big idea: ""Eureka! I've got it! Moby Dick ... Only on LAND! ... With DRAGONS!""

Somehow, it happened. Unlike Travolta's Battlefield Earth or Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, Age of the Dragons has no big name Hollywood ""auteur"" behind it bamboozling the usual BS detectors with which Hollywood majors are festooned. That this film ever saw the light of day is, simply put, a cock-up, for which someone - probably quite a few people - will be fired.

Moby Dick for landlubbers. Lord, give me strength.

Now taking place on dry land presents some obvious dramatic challenges to Melville's original story. It takes away the need for everyone to be holed up, festering, on a boat in the middle of a seething ocean. There is no threshold-crossing moment when our hero vaults the gunwale, away from safe dry land and commends his mortal soul to the unknowable madness of a possessed man. Since these absences futz with the dramatic set up of Moby Dick, director Ryan Little contrives to have them all set off on a boat anyway. An ironclad boat. On wheels. Every now an then, they all hop out of it and wander about.

In this and many other ways Ryan Little's film takes large liberties with Melville's plot, whilst keeping sacred faith with smaller details, the way you'd do if you had only a passing familiarity with the story. A voice-over describes second mate Stubbs (a comparatively excellent Vinnie Jones) in terms strikingly reminiscent of the Wikipedia entry for Moby Dick.

Ryan Little might still have got away with all of this had he an intelligent screenplay, a capable cast or at least a sense of humour at his disposal. That the scant display of any of the three comes in the single person of Vinnie Jones, who really is the best thing in the film by a country mile (until his character snuffs it at the end of the first act), ought to tell you all you need to know.

Danner Glover - yes, the very same - appears eventually as Ahab, chews far more scenery than any of the dragons, and elsewhere hovers between being clad in protective clothing of a (vaguely) George Clintonesque aspect and sharing screen time with a younger version of himself, in an oft-repeated flashback to a childhood incident featuring the dragon, his sister, a bucket, a river and a field of barley (symbolism highly resemblent of Gladiator, but pointed at nothing in particular). Anthropomorphising the Captain's torment beyond the obsessive lust for revenge - not something Herman Melville felt any need to do - also seems an odd decision.

Other than that, there's little to say. It's frightfully derivative. The snow special effects are dreadful. Outside of Jones' twinkling eye and Glover's histrionics, the workaday cast spar gamely with a dreadful script, but cannot land a blow. Corey Sevier's Ishmael is anodyne and forgettable in all respects bar his resemblance to an effete Colin Farrell. Kepa Kruse - now there's a stage name - plays Queeqeg as a literate savage whose role in life is continually to bail out poor wet little Ishmael but otherwise makes no sense that cannot be extracted from foreknowledge of Melville's book. Sofia Pernas, as luscious Rachel, plays Ishmael's romantic opposite (surprise! Melville didn't think of that either!) by lurching uneasily between Xena Warrior Princess and a traditionally distressed Hollywood damsel.

Meanwhile, despite mountainous quantities of earnestness, Ryan Little fails to inject an iota of drama, pacing or much in the way of character arc into proceedings and then fully squanders the opportunity for redemption by means of a dramatic final showdown, which simply never materialises.

It's all over in an hour and a half, and (this could become a catchphrase, I know) at least it isn't in 3D.

4327771,3,B004CKCOFS,"Although the story is reminiscent of Moby Dick, it was entertaining. The CG of the dragons and flying sequences were done well and believable.",1354406400,,142,4.958333333333333
4327772,4,B004CKCOFS,"The first time I saw a movie adaptation for Moby Dick was starring Gregory Peck as Ahab. As an adaptation, it was fair, Gregory Peck the only savior in his presentation of the obsessed and mad Ahab. My most memorable scene was when Ahab was caught to his obsession, the great white whale, and in death still bidding the sailors to pursue the creature.

This is the second time I have watched 'Age of the Dragon', and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Danny Glover did a wonderful job of portraying the vengeance-crazed Ahab who hunts the white dragon. Some people have accused him of over-acting, but his performance didn't jump on that particular hot-button for me. Well, not so much that it made me roll my eyes and turn it off, unlike Jeremy Irons in Dungeons & Dragons (and almost everything else I've seen him in).

They utilized back-flashes and teasers to introduce the viewer to the taint of guilt that eats at Ahab's sanity. The scenes were reminiscent of what a person with a haunted past sees moments before they are able to shut down the memory. To be so tortured when he supposedly faced-off with the white dragon made me curious as to whether or not the tales that are told of his courage were wrong and kept me intrigued to figure out more of this madman's story.

The sets and culture were believable, and it was a breath of fresh air to watch a fantasy-take on this classic novel. So often fantasy movies are cheese and corn, but not so with 'Age of the Dragon'. The writing and acting did not come across as campy, and believe me when I say I have turned off many fantasy movies after only the first 20 seconds. In 'Age of the Dragon' I believed the characters, their passions, and their agonies. I especially enjoyed the friendship between QuiQuay and Ishmael.

If I ever find this on BluRay, I will add it to my collection of enjoyable dragon/fantasy movies along with Reign of Fire and DragonHeart. I'm still uncertain if I want to add DragonHeart: A New Beginning, Dragon Wars and Eragon or not, because the camp and cliche on those can be a bit much after a time. I will need to watch them again before making a decision.
