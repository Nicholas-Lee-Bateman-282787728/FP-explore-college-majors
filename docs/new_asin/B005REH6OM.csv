 The 1930's was a great decade for films to this very day . The 1930's is the number one decade in movie history.",1491696000,4,263,4.0576923076923075

8484252,5,B005REH6OM,"City Streets is a painful fulfillment of the old phrase, ""Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it."" Nan is the daughter of a racketeer, Pop Cooley, and falls in love with The Kid, who is disinclined to join her father in his crooked business and thereby support Nan in the style to which she is accustomed. Her dastardly father sets up Nan to take the fall for a murder, and during her imprisonment, she changes her mind about pushing The Kid into a life of crime. But is she too late? Inventive director Rouben Mamoulian (Queen Christina, The Mark of Zorro) gives us his only gangster film based on the only original screenplay written by Dashiel Hammet (The Thin Man). The star is Gary Cooper in his only gangster film, produced by Paramount, a studio not known for that genre. Curioser and Curioser! Mamoulian makes creative use of shadow and light to create an atmosphere almost too beautiful to genuinely be dingy crime-ridden city streets. Gorgeous Cooper offers a subtle performance, with a masterful use of facial expression and body language. The sinfully beautiful Sylvia Sidney is perfect as his moll. I loved seeing Paul Lucas and Guy Kibbee, usually the good guys, playing such utter slime balls with unabashed relish. I am completely unfamiliar with Wynne Gibson, but brother, is she spectacular! This is one of the best gangster films of an era when that genre flourished.",1347148800,17,1396,4.796680497925311
