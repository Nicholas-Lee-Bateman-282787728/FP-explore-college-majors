The ending is brutal and heartless, but unexpected.  The sound track is blazin just like the movie, it got some stuff from Beatnuts. There was a white kid in the movie he kinda wack, aside from that the fights where kinda phat. Fat Joe, Cuban link and Angie Martinez they where in the movie but not as much as I had hoped, Angie kinda hot in the movie rocking some tight leather gear. Got to get the DVD got some cool behind the scene stuff.",986688000,,600,4.2631578947368425
7945116,2,B000059H7E,This film was unintentionally hilarious. I think they meant to make a somewhat serious action movie but it's so ridiculously terrible that it is quite hilarious. If you expect a well done indie film look elsewhere. If you enjoy a fine fecal abortion then you may have fun with this. Good for some laughs. Not sure I'd recommend paying money for this.,1481068800,,350,4.661290322580645
7945117,1,B000059H7E,Horrible movie!!!! I want a refund!!!,1468800000,,37,5.333333333333333
7945118,1,B000059H7E,I thought Fat Joe was going to make this a master peice but was I wrong. This is a low budget DVD that I was upset I purchased.,1361059200,,127,3.5714285714285716
7945119,5,B000059H7E,Great getto film Michael has a hot steamy love affair scene in this which is hot. I love you Michael!!,1078531200,,102,4.15
7945120,4,B000059H7E,"I'm tired of independent films that are just loosely based around quirky dialogue.  This movie has plenty of action and karate, which you don't usually see in indie films.  Michael Wehrhahn has come a long way! This was really his film, but they had to throw in Cuban Link, Fat Joe, and Angie Martinez to attract a niche market.  I feel bad for some of the reviews it received, but those are from people expecting to see something different.  They went just to see some rappers appear in film, but were disappointed when they were presented with a legitimate cinematic work.  It you want to see rappers, watch MTV.",1077667200,,614,4.5963302752293576
7945121,1,B000059H7E,"This is one of the worst movies I'v ever seen, and I wouldnt reccomend it to someone I hated. I only bought the movie for one reason, Cuban Link, and he was barely in it. Everyone else are TERRIBLE as actors and Link is the only one that can really act, which he barely gets the chance to do. DONT see this movie.",1017532800,,313,3.984126984126984
7945122,1,B000059H7E,"This movie is ... it was nothing at all like fatjoe's other film Thicker than water which was very good. This film has a awful plot, and it also has some karate in which I thought was dumb for this type of film. There was a guy who looked like billy blanks wannabe. I also thought that it would have been more focused on the rappers in the film but instead it was about some stupid kids who somehow know karate, and the girls mom is 60 years old and she tries to be a major drug dealer, and her daughter is a crackhead who can't act or sing. It isn't worth to even get on bootleg or to rent don't let the cover fool you it is not worth your time. I gave it to one of my friends and he said it was extermely stale.",1011916800,,713,3.857142857142857
7945123,1,B000059H7E,"This must be the worst film in my collection poor acting no story line what so ever, I thought it would be good because of the line up, you had Cuban Link who is the only one who can act but he was hardly in the film and Angie & Fat Joe I'm not even going to start on there acting skill's or lack of, and the other actors just as bad, Don't wasted your money on this film if you don't belive me rent it first you will see, the only good thing was the soundtrack.",1005696000,3,462,3.7731958762886597
7945124,5,B000059H7E,"This is what I'm talking about. Hardcore, nonstop action without all the normal Hollywood cliches. Hollywood could learn a thing or two from this movie. The two fat boys were awesome. Check out the credits, one of them is also the director. How in the world did he pull that off? DVD is totally awesome. Lots of information. The ending is definitely hot. Definitely worth a sequel.",998006400,,381,4.701492537313433
7945125,5,B000059H7E,"This flick was off the hook! Dope soundtrack and the fat dudes in the flick steal the show. Angie Martinez is real fine and girl knows how to pack heat like a pro. The whole thing is east coast,but it's still good for any ghetto. Put an A.P.B. out on this flick!",997315200,,262,4.0576923076923075
