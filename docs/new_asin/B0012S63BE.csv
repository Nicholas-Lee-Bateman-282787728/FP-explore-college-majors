8550668,1,B0012S63BE,"Very poorly done. Sloppy mess of a film. One would think that anyone making a film like this would understand that gays want to see good looking young men. Instead they focus on fat over-the-hill drag queens. The host sticks his nose right in front of the camera lens and has nothing worthwhile to say. The only excuse one can imagine, is that they were all too stoned to make a decent film. They have a few good shots of guys that look like they found there way into the film almost by accident.  Surely Amsterdam has more to offer than this fort five minutes of embarrassingly amature video.",1248912000,2,593,4.440366972477064
