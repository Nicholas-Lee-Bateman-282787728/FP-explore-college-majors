1994596,2,6300248291,"Throughout M. Night Shyamalan's career, the director has always handled the building of suspense with a gifted intuition. In The Happening, the suspense is still present in moderate doses, but his notions of terror just don't complement his attention to buildup. As each of the director's films goes by, his concepts of horror gradually diminish and the psychological thrills are replaced with more generic and less inspired forms of creating scares.

A vicious chemical attack occurs in New York City and quickly spreads to neighboring states, causing mass hysteria and countless deaths. Of the few survivors able to get clear of the affected area, science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his troubled wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) must overcome their personal dilemmas to save those whose lives have been entrusted to them.

With Shyamalan's clever setups and unique ideas for suspense, resorting to more savage visuals seems below the director's normal methods. Yet The Happening is indeed rated R for violence, though the deaths never really require such visceral exhibitions and don't even utilize the boundaries the rating offers. The film is neither overly bloody nor excessively brutal, and the gore doesn't enhance the scares. In Hitchcock's The Birds, violence was used to complement the terror and a creature certainly not synonymous with horror became a nightmarish purveyor of fear. Shyamalan attempts to copy this strategy with his own unusual villain, but fails to use gore to his advantage and the threat caused never reaches a satisfying level of trepidation.

Again the director has filled his cast with notable and mostly wise choices, as Wahlberg easily portrays the quick-thinking science teacher tasked with protecting his makeshift family. Flimsy dialogue can't keep the actor from bringing an engaging character to life, though more development couldn't have hurt. Zooey Deschanel creates an interesting counterpart, though her role never garners the required screen time to flesh out a more complex relationship with her costar. Almost all of the supporting characters stand out but receive such little attention from the camera that their efforts are all but wasted. Both John Leguizamo's Julian and Betty Buckley's infinitely creepy Mrs. Jones never fully realize their potential in the brief amount of time they're given.

While several scenes showcase the director's admirable grasp on building suspense, his visions of true fear have become as clouded as The Happening's opening credits. Amping up the film's display of bloodletting to earn an R rating has done little to increase the actual terror committed to the screen, and we're left with what is likely the first ever public service announcement horror film.

The acting lacks emotion especially from Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. I seen better acting from a 1980's Burger King Commercial.  The writing is cheesy as Pizza Hut's Big New Yorker Pizza and ridiculous as Road Rovers (but not as fun). The same goes for the dialogue & cinematography. The ending is confusing this side of a bad WWE PPV. Worst of all, the movie reveals the plot twist far too early thus taking away any mystery and tension what so ever.

I was interested in the premise, and I like sci-fi and dystopia. But this movie is so stupid (how the plants make the wind go in a certain direction, or whistle, is beyond me), so badly directed and shot (there are whole scenes where we're just a little too close to Mark Whalberg's face, with his nostrils ever so slightly emphasized), and the acting is so, so awful. Zoey Deschanel is never very good, but here it's like she thinks that she's in TV a comedy or something. Of course, with the wooden, soap opera dialogue that they had to work with, I'm not sure how even meryl streep would have fared. I watched it when I was exhausted and just wanted something to escape into. Lasted for about 45 minutes and gave up---it was making me too mad, noticing all the bad things about it.

The supporting actors were good as well and did well with their character.  I would have to say this movie has its toes on the line of crossing into a low budget.  There was an ever so slight ""slap stick"" lingering around in the dialogue.  You could almost see them breaking character. Then a second later, a young person is getting shot in the head.

Terrible acting, bad directing, bad editing, cheap looking, dull script - these are the highlights.
Bad if not completely strange acting by Zooey Deschanel, who seems to be in a different movie than the rest of the cast. I think she was told that this was an upbeat horror comedy. Wahlberg in just made of wood - and not the good polished wood you would like for a coffee table, no, I mean the particle board you get for a shoe shelf that is going into the closet. Luckily, the chemistry between Deschanel and Wahlberg saves the day - I'm just kidding, there is nothing there. As I used the remote more and more to speed through to the end of the film I was rooting for ""the happening"" to happen to all of them.

1994639,3,6300248291,"This film was very average, on a scale of one to ten I would rate it a five. There could have been a lot more in a film boasting such a powerful message about the planet's reaction to human action (for every action there is a reaction, no?). I don't feel like I wasted my time but I also wouldn't watch it again unless someone begged me to, and that being said it'd be a nice background movie.

**Note I don't give away spoilers but I do speak vaguely of the ending without revealing what it is***

It seemed as if Shyamalan was struggling to incorporate his ominous, and horror-esque feeling into this movie. The ending did not match up with the reoccurring feeling that he had attempted to mold throughout the film and, in this sense--while still maintaining some of the qualities that were present for the duration of the film--the ending was actually rather disappointing in so far as it could have ""fit"" in better.

I read the reviews after watching the movie and I felt the need to weigh in and say I really don't think the end of the movie leaves that many questions. In fact, knowing the intent of the movie--which is a statement about environmental destruction and perhaps a theory of mother nature's potential to reset itself in order to survive--it seems to be a very linear and logical ending.",1500508800,,1305,4.521186440677966
1994640,1,6300248291,"This is one of the worst films I've seen in a theater.  Ever since I wasted my $20 on the ticket I swore I will never watch another M. Night Shamalan film again.  It was not just me that hated it, people in the packed theater as people started dying off were laughing loud enough to lose some later dialogue.  It's a ridiculous film... as a friend of mine stated - it's one thing to say (as they do in the movie) that the plants are making people ""lose their survival instinct"" it's quite another to then have someone who is ""affected by the plants"" LAY DOWN IN FRONT OF A LAWN MOWER ON PURPOSE.  The characters are paper thin and by the end you don't care who if anyone lived or died.

(Good luck doing yard work post viewing).  A movie audience may find that extremely thought-provoking and suspenseful; others may laugh their butt off!  LOL.  You be the judge.  But I don't think it's quite as bad as you've heard, and at least it has everyone's All American Mark Wahlberg, though it's been reported that even Mark took jabs at writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"") for what he deemed a hokey, too-far-fetched script, even for Hollywood (though I'm sure it was after Mark cashed his check).  I also liked John Leguizamo, but unfortunately his screen time was way too limited, and my vote for this movie's best performance would actually go to young Ashlyn Sanchez, who plays Leguizamo's character's daughter.  Zooey Deschanel plays Mark's wife, though her dedication to the role seems to wax and wane (but maybe you can't blame her).  Watch for Mara Hobel (little ""Christina"" from ""Mommie Dearest;"" she also played ""Charlotte"" on TV's ""Roseanne"") in the countryside scenes; she only has a couple of lines but plays them for all their worth.

As he usually does with his scripts, M.Knight tends to provoke the viewer; intrigues us to ""imagine if you will"".  What I like about this story, is how appropriate it is in light of what we're doing to our planet.  As is true, in real life, living things; plants and trees in this case;  do react to survive.  Our planet can only take so much, and we see ourselves wondering ""could this happen?"".  We remember in grade school those experiments our science teacher used to teach us about how plants thrive with classical music, but shrivel up and die with loud, disturbing sound?  Plants have nervous systems and can actually feel pain - it's scientifically true.  With that in mind, the movie was not so far fetched as some think.  The ending wasn't ""flat"" as someone mentioned before, it merely demonstrated that this movement, or plant reaction was moving to other regions; perhaps trying to teach us a lesson, state by state.  It was very imaginative, and definitely thought provoking.  I loved it; have viewed it twice now.",1462060800,,1141,4.741116751269035

Zooney or what ever her name is looks startled for 90 minutes.

1994881,1,6300248291,"Maybe New Yorker's and Philadelphian's are so inured of crime that when huge swaths of pedestrians are overcome by some strange viral  rictis that transforms them into a suicidal flash mob, somehow the unaffected citizens that remain are simply allowed to go about their business, boarding trains and driving cars with minimal disruption by the mysteriously indifferent civil authorities.

And so it goes in one of Hollywood's biggest blowout disasters where absentee direction and cartoon mayhem make an unintentionally hilarious goofball comedy out of M. Night Shyamalan's paean to progressive Global Warming orthodoxy.

Not that the ever-popular Mark Wahlberg needs our sympathy but what was he thinking when forced to recite off a script laden with constipated, half-wit banalities better suited to a Roger Corman fright-fest than a major release of a then major director - ""I know I may die, but I'd rather die in your arms, I'm coming out."" ""Hot dogs get a bad rap, they're protein after all."" I almost choked on a Raisinette I was laughing so hard. Never has a script been bogged down in more random non-sequiturs than this Magic Eight Ball hate crime against film and actors everywhere.

And then this mixed-up muddle inexplicably ends, suddenly and without explanation, with Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel (in an acting coma for most of the film) back in Philadelphia looking forward to the birth of their child, leaving the angry villagers still awake in the audience to wrestle with a hastily conceived Climate Change denouement as the credits roll and this wind-borne pestilence takes out Paris.

1994912,2,6300248291,"To me the Happening was just pretty average.  It reminded me a lot of the 1980's movie Maximum Overdrive but instead of the machinery coming alive to kill people this time it is something sight unseen that causes people to commit suicide.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the first half of the film is not too bad and would be a 3 star movie but by the halfway mark the movie just kind of stops making sense.  There is never a good explanation about what causes the event and all the people in the film just figure out that they had to stay separated away from each other.  Maybe if there was some kind of UFO in orbit causing the mind control or something like that could have helped the film.  It just feels like a large chunk of the film nothing happens and the actors are just waiting to die like lemmings.

There has been a lot of renewed interest in apocalyptical films lately World War Z, I Am Legend, Dawn of the Dead that kind of thing.  If this movie was better explained why the event happened it would have been a much stronger production.  Maybe if this was a precursor to A Night of the Living Dead or leading up to a horror movie midway through it could have been more interesting.  The Happening is really not worth your time.  Once you watch it once, there is very little rewatch value to it.  I would probably rate it 2 1/2 stars its not outright terrible and the acting is not really bad it is just that the plot does not make a lot of sense.  I usually enjoy John Leguizamo and Mark Wahlberg's films but this is definitely one to skip.",1456963200,,1569,4.228187919463087

I like mark wahlberg, but he is extremely bland in most things he does, his almost monotone voice, so why, WHY was he paired with Zoey Deschanel? WHY! . They both have the same acting style, so it cancels each other out into a boring bowl of mashed potatoes. The deaths are pretty creative, and wonderfully filmed. Speaking of filming, i love it, i love the scenery, i love the new ways of looking at old things. The score is stunning, as per usual, James Newton Howard is wonderful, as always. Seriously, M.Night has the perfect person doing the score, i usually cancelled out the horrible combined acting of Zoey and Mark, and just listened to the score. I think it probably would have done better as a silent movie, but that's just me. The other cast members do a good job of breaking up (ha!) the monotony.

1994940,5,6300248291,"LOVED everything about this movie! I originally saw it shortly after it came out and then watched it twice again since. To me, it's one of those movies that I could see over & over again and always see some new detail I missed before. It's visually appealing and the acting is just great all around but especially the performances by Mark Wahlberg & Zooey Deschanel. Frank Collison was memorable. It's an interesting tale & the pace of the film is just right. Really good story telling, almost like a 'science fiction fairy tale!'  I'd say 75% of the time I agree with critics and usually consult film reviews before considering a movie selection, however, in this case my own review differs somewhat and I give The Happening 5 stars. I predict that years from now it will become a favorite among sci-fi fans.
*** Edited, April 24, 2016: While reading critical reviews of this film today, I learned that Roger Ebert gave The Happening a 3 out of 4. That's high praise indeed from the respected critic.

apparently taking revenge on humans by poisoning the air in retaliation for something or another.  Maybe ""Fat Albert"" Gore sicked the plants on
us; who knows.  Anyhow, the film stared the irrepressible Zooey Deschanel, who I adore and Mark Walhberg (Boogie Nights, but no strap 0n) who
I guess was her Husband though at the beginning one is not sure.  Anyhow, people just start dropping dead or committing suicide. The whole North
East of the country was affected; should have attacked California because most of those people are Zombies anyway and you can't poison a Zombie!  Anyhow, much of the film was dealing with our two stars and a little girl trying to keep alive.  I thought the Cinematographer spent I lot
of time showing Zooey up close so he could show those beautiful blue eyes of hers.  Picture quality was good and the price very reasonable.

1994981,3,6300248291,"...but it's not a comedy. (spoilers ahoy) M. Night Shyamalan directs an A list cast in a movie that is about what happens when plants get annoyed with mankind. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore, a high school science teacher called upon to lead a group of survivors through the New England plantocalypse. Zoe Deschanel plays his estranged wife, Alma. John Leguizamo steals scenes as the math teacher best friend who for some reason decides to let the Moores look after his daughter during the New England plantocalypse. Other respected character actors also wander in and out of the frame. Everybody delivers mundane lines with the urgency of a Michael Bay production. It's awesome. I won't get too much into what the plants are doing to cull the human population, because you have probably already seen the gist of it in the trailer. I'll just say that the initial shock wears off fast because every time it happens it goes into ridiculous overkill. And then there's the reaction shots. Priceless.

Humans are outnumbered and if this species does not wake up out of the delusion that everything here is to serve them, (the arrogance of that belief astounds me) other species in nature are going to fight back. and they will wipe us out.

1994992,5,6300248291,"I don't understand all the negative reviews, I truly don't.  M Night Schollemer's The Happening is one of the greatest comedies of the past decade.  Whether intentional or not, few movies had me in stitches more than this hilariously preposterous movie bestowed onto us by the brilliant auteur Mr. Schollinger.  For crissakes there's a scene where Donnie Walbergh initiates a conversation with a houseplant, but then stops when he realizes that the plant is fake.  Hey we've all been there.  This is Plan 9 From Outer Space levels of so-bad-it's-good. But surely M Nice Shamberg, the creator of such classics as Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and that movie with the aliens who are allergic to water attempting an invasion of a planet 70% covered in water by hanging out in Joaquin Phoenix's pantry, knew what he was doing. The people who badmouth this movie just don't understand M C Hammer's genius.  As terrible as the movie is, it's entirely because of its multi-layered absurdity, and it never gets boring or slow enough for me to lose interest.

A great apocalyptic story that is very character driven and a cast that pulls it of.

The message was quite dogmatic and immature, although most viewers will agree that mankind should respect the earth. The end was unexpected and there were many bloodcurdling moments. Mark Wahlberg's performance was very convincing, but despite Mark's altruistic character this film failed to appease and/or reassure humanity that there is another scientific explanation to the deadly toxin which the trees have discharged.

The storyline has nature rising up and all the different plant species send out the same chemical into the wind that causes humans to commit sucide seems to stretch the imagination beyond acceptability.

1995031,2,6300248291,"I will not cover the plot-line and development of the story here because others have obviously already done that very well.  I will, however, list the strengths and weaknesses of the film as I seem them.

Strengths:

1. The overall 'look' of the film is highly appropriate, with a starkness of contrast re:  light-to-dark that is good for this type of story.  Too often IMO, this detail is overlooked or perhaps 'over-processed' in the filming of crime or suspense stories (be it TV or movie).  For example, the early, first season of 'Criminal Minds' had that look and it was great; not long after, however, CBS decided to use 'Hollywood lighting' as I call it and the look of the series became too 'smooth' or 'processed' with warmer rather than cooler tones (kind of like NCIS, which I love, but not for the lighting or tones).

2. The opening sequences were quite good and I found them very compelling as 'attention grabbers'.

3. I am not a huge fan and I certainly have not seen all of his work, but must say that John Lequizamo does the best acting I've seen him do in his smallish supporting role here.  Granted, his 'mojo' seems to be in portraying manic, extreme characters to begin with, but I liked his understated performance in this film.

4. Other supporting roles are also quite noteworthy:

a. Betty Buckley's performance as Mrs. Jones. Her performance is very creepy, especially in contrast to her 'nice person'/wholesome' overall look (and physical attractiveness despite her age, for that matter).

b. Frank Collison as the quirky yet intelligent and informed nursery owner

c. Jeremy Strong as the simple yet brave Private Austen

Weaknesses:

1. Ill-Conceived Antagonist - Mother Nature as the threat?  How so?  I'm not a scientific type, but the threat outlined here seemed entirely implausible and has no referent in actuality/experience, at least to my knowledge (trying not to give away too much of the specifics of the supposed threat and its effects on people).  This is a big problem in that the threat is what propels the story.  Also, why it would 'attack' people in larger vs. smaller groups was not satisfactorily explained IMO.  As a sci-fi fan, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, but when you get into the area of nature attacking mankind - especially in the specific manner outlined in the story - it seems that the threat in question should have some basis in reality.

2. A lot of people would probably not admit this - probably because of the Marky Mark connection - but I enjoy Mark Wahlberg's acting in most things I've seen.  Here, however, he seems very 'wooden' and largely out of his depth for carrying the emotional arc of the storyline (though to be fair, the ""Can I have one damn minute to think?"" scene was good).  I actually laughed out loud at his delivery of a number of lines because his inflections were virtually identical to those mocked in the SNL skit wherein Andy Samberg impersonates Wahlberg:  ""What's that all about?""  ""Well say hello to your mother for me.""  Wahlberg does seem to inflect a lot of statement type lines (declarative) with the 'rise' of inflection you'd typically find in a question (interrogative).  I was pulling for him to deliver here, but I don't think he succeeded.  He also didn't seem very emotionally invested in the character; his delivery had a 'going through the motions' quality IMO.

3. Zoe Deschanel - her part was rather small given the fact that she was in the majority of scenes in the movie. Her character (Alma) was not very well developed at all, so she did not have much to work with in terms of the script.  I don't think that she can be blamed for the 'under-performance'.

4. Weak Closing/Resolution - No real 'closure' or 'reveal' to the story as to why the 'happening' occurred, in part, because its causes were never clearly defined.  The ending seems to just sort of 'wilt'.  Not satisfying at all.",1419379200,,3915,4.727138643067847

1995050,1,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan started with a great idea for this movie: Mother Nature taking revenge on mankind for abusing the planet. This could have been a truly amazing film. What this turned out to be is something that should have been left on the cutting room floor to be swept away and left to rot in a landfill. In terms of quality, this movie makes ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" look like the ""Silence of the Lambs"".

The movie starts out okay. Mark Wahlberg plays a quirky science professor. His class discussions suggest some foreshadowing and expertise behind future events; however, these expectations fall dreadfully short from being fulfilled. Actually, all expectations for this film are refuted. The storyline is bland and has no real plot. Early in the film, one event sets the wheels in motion for the rising action. That's pretty much where the movie plateaus. There is no driving force to carry you through to the end.

The dialogue is synthetic and clumsy. If I were facing a life-threatening, environmental crisis, I would be discussing things relevant to the events at-hand. These people had the most odd, insignificant things to say. It was absolutely ludicrous. Some scenes were so bizarre that all I could say was ""WTF?""

The actors' performances were equally as hollow as the individuals they portrayed. The characters have no depth and offer no additional substance to this film; no glimpse into something that might ignite a plot twist, or, even more importantly, A PLOT. The general over-all feeling was as if everyone were fumbling their way through the script for the first time. Mark Wahlberg is typically a very good actor. In this movie, his acting seems forced and unnatural. The closest comparison I can think of is watching his reaction to someone repeatedly snapping a rubber band against his face. Zoey Deschanel's character seems oblivious and disinterested in the events surrounding her. John Leguizamo was slightly more convincing, but very awkward.

I thought the Fantastic Four sequel was awful, but this by far takes the golden turkey for the worst movie I have seen in many years. I would rather chew on broken glass and gargle lemon juice than watch this again.",1411516800,,2196,4.927027027027027

1995053,1,6300248291,"The premise of this movie is so absurd that it could have made a great black comedy, but unfortunately they tried to make a serious movie out of it. The premise is that there's a part of the human brain that controls our sense of self-preservation, and if that part of the brain stops working, you will pretty much automatically kill yourself in whatever way is available. Apparently plants in the northeastern USA felt threatened by man and started emitting a neurotoxin that shuts this part of the brain down, resulting in mass-suicide. (They never said for sure what caused it. Several possibilities were mentioned--terrorism, government experiments, etc.--but in the end it seemed to be implying that the grass and trees were responsible for the deaths of everyone from Boston to Maryland who wasn't able to escape before being affected by the suicide gas.)

In one scene, a policeman shot himself. A nearby cab driver who witnessed the suicide got out of his cab, picked up the dead policeman's gun, and shot himself with it. Then a nearby pedestrian picked up the same gun and killed herself with it, also. It was meant to be shocking, but I was laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was. Even if there is a part of the brain that prevents us from killing ourselves, if this part stops working, we would still need an actual reason to do it.

In another scene, it was raining construction workers who were walking off the edge of the high rise building they were working on, plummeting to their deaths. One man offed himself by starting a tractor mower, putting it into gear, and laying down in front of it.... Do you see what I mean when I say this could have been a great black comedy?

If it actually was Shyamalan's intention to make a black comedy, he failed, because the humor came through too infrequently. I only laughed at the suicide scenes I mentioned above, and maybe one or two other places, and that's about it. It looked to me, though, like he was actually trying to make a serious, heavy and disturbing movie, and it was anything but. Don't waste your time with this one.",1410652800,,2098,4.634408602150538

1995055,2,6300248291,"I wanted to like this, but I have to agree with the other reviewers who are disappointed with this and feel Shy is off the rails.

Reportedly he had great difficulty selling this concept to a studio. Having seen it, I can see why.

It's amateurish, the plot concept is vague and incomplete and full of holes.
Casting is unwise. Wahlberg and Deschanel have zero chemistry together --far from being married, neither even gives any sign of being hetero. Their characters are cardboard, and so is their acting.

Deschanel appears totally stoned or heavily sedated through the entire film--she's barely present at all.
Wahlberg's character is an uninteresting, passive beta-male schoolteacher who's totally not up for a flat tire, much less Apocalypse. He's not an interesting character to spend time with, and his total wussiness makes the character both annoying and a laughingstock.
By the :35 mark, you've had it with both characters and you are actively hoping they will die. Messily. Horribly. And soon.
That's probably not what Director Shy wants you to feel. And that's how badly this awful movie is off the rails.

The idea of the general tree-and-plant population being self-aware and wanting to kill humans is interesting for about exactly 60 seconds. It can't be sustained for a feature film. The longer you spend time with it, the more ridiculous it becomes.
""Ridiculous"" is probably NOT the reaction Shy was striving for, either.

The ending is maudlin and hokey and beyond unbelievable. And then there's an even hokier, even more implausible '6 months later' afterthought PS tacked on which is even worse.
It's like Shy suffered a series of small damaging overdose strokes somewhere during production. Honestly, it's impossible to believe this amateurish, embarrassingly bad 'senior year film project' was made by the same director who gave us 'Sixth Sense'.

And 'Sixth Sense' is now a looong, loooong time ago.

There are maybe six good moments in this film. Just enough to make a decent 10-minute short. Too bad there's no market for 10 minute shorts after you graduate Film School.

Just awful. I mean, MST3K-level awful. See it for free on Streaming if you like...for free, it's worth 90 minutes. You can always do laundry at the same time--don't worry, you won't miss anything. These are annoyingly cardboard characters in a ridiculous situation and very soon You. Just. Want. Them. To. Die.

Hope this is helpful. If you want to see a good Shy film, see The Village, or Circles, or Sixth Sense one more time. The great Orson Welles did Citizen Kane, then a series of never-quite-as-interesting films, and wound up doing Gallo wine commercials and being parodied on SNL. Let's hope Shy does not continue along that path.",1410048000,,2736,4.982456140350878

Innocence and true love saved the day and ended the plague.  The plague starts again in France because well, we all know the French ruin everything...No for real, I think it had to do with Zooey getting pregnant. I think that upset the balance somehow.  I haven't worked out that part of the twist.  I just know that plants letting off neurotoxins was not the actual reason.

1995077,4,6300248291,"Sir, we lost contact.
With whom?
Everyone.

I admit it. M. Night Shyamalan scares the beejezus out of me. I have watched, and actually own a few of his movies. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable  and Signs are all on my DVD movie shelf. I have The Last Airbender on my list to watch, as I really enjoyed the animated series. I will watch his others, I just don't really watch television all that much right now.

The Happening is only a 90-minute flick, and it was a good way to wake up this evening when I crawled out of bed. Sometimes, when I have had trouble sleeping it takes me a while to get truly conscious, so tea and a muffin and a movie are sometimes the perfect way to wake up.

I didn't even really recognize that this was a Shyamalan film until I actually opened it up in my movie rental list. Bless Dishs little heart for offering a great list of free movies!

The Happening one of Shyamalans best, but it certainly isn't his worst. Not as bone-chilling as some of the others, what starts out as what is thought to be a terrorist attack becomes something much more, as humans begin slaughtering themselves in Central Park. The contagion spreads across the east coast, attacking smaller and smaller populations, until nearly the whole population is extinct.

Shyamalan has created a tight film, set within a short time period, which addresses the human depredation of the Earth  and the Earths capability to fight back. I got a huge kick out of it! I loved the idea of the Earth finally saying Enough! If you like Shyamalans odd, quirky style and a film which addresses our carelessness towards this beautiful blue planet we are blessed with, give this movie a try. It didn't get really good reviews in a lot of places, but we cant all like the same things, right? It isn't Signs but it is a great little movie for what it is  one of the earlier works of a brilliant man.

About M. Night Shyamalan

When you say fear of the unknown, that is the definition of fear; fear is the unknown, fear is what you do not know, and its genetically within us so that we feel safe. We feel scared of the woods because were not familiar with it, and that keeps you safe.

Born in India but raised in the posh suburban Penn Valley area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, M. Night Shyamalan is the son of two doctors. His passion for filmmaking began when he was given a Super-8 camera at age eight, and even at that young age began to model his career on that of his idol, Steven Spielberg. His first film, Praying with Anger (1992), was based somewhat on his own trip back to visit the India of his birth. He raised all the funds for this project, in addition to directing, producing and starring in it. Wide Awake (1998), his second film, he wrote and directed, and shot it in the Philadelphia-area Catholic school he once attendedeven though his family was of a different religion, they sent him to that school because of its strict discipline.

1995087,4,6300248291,"There is a lot going on in this movie, but it is mostly internal --it isn't WWZ or Armageddon. I am giving this 4 stars because it is not his best film --there is not the ""OMG"" moment that I am afraid fans have come to expect from Shyamalan, but it is thought-provoking, tragic and filled with 3 dimensional characters (like us).  If you like the whispered-message-feel of Shyamalan's other movies you will probably enjoy this. Like his other films it focuses on people, their struggle and journey --not only through the outward events of the movie but through their own inner turmoil. And like his other films you have to invest yourself and pay attention to hear the messages. Some people said it was gory in their reviews. I might be a little desensitized but I didn't think so (if I rate my self for gross-out, Shaun of the Dead was too much for me, even though it  is meant to be a comedy). I respect that there were some graphic scenes but Shyamalan knew when to turn the camera away making the deaths more sad and despairing instead of a movie spectacle to shock and thrill.  I DID put my arm across my face at the lawn mower (this shouldn't be a spoiler, as it was in the trailer) but the reaction on Mark Wahlberg's face gives rise to as much dread as the scene itself. And that is why this is not the 2 star clunker people keep claiming. Also, to people that scoffed at the premise of the film, all I can say is ""You missed the point"" and ""It is a MOVIE"". And for a movie, the directing is masterful. I will remember watching the woman in heels slowly and then more determinedly walk towards the police pistol, the absolute heartbreak on the construction workers face, the clasping of hands of a mature couple when they know what comes next, John Leguizamo sitting in a street; utterly shattered, and a soldier's pleading look as he struggles to hold on to reality, long after the more graphic scenes have faded from my mind. I have to even smirk a little at how banal the zoo scene appeared  --it is one of the worst for gore-- but it has the authentic feel of how this WOULD look if someone just shot it with their cell phone like a disturbing vacation video (""..and then there was this odd event at the zoo...you don't see That every day."") People's reactions were very authentic throughout. Some would shoot video with their cell phone instead of attempting to help. Some would pretend they couldn't hear those in need, some would offer a hand and want to pull together, and others, tragically, would respond to requests for help with deadly violence.  If you are a Shyamalan fan or if you are looking for a thriller/horror film with a little more meat on its psychological and philosophical bones --that isn't shredded, bleeding, and leaves you sleeping with the lights on-- this will deliver.",1397260800,,2808,4.4980392156862745

Mysterious toxins is somehow making people kill themselves and the whole movie's premise is about what caused it and why its happening, with lots of silly exposition throughout etc. The idea sounds interesting enough, but the problem is everyone in the movie talks like a 5 year old the entire time and nobody seems to have a brain cell between them. Honestly it takes about 59 minutes until you see someone finally thinks to wear a gas mask!! Some of the death scenes where lots of people are shooting themselves in the head is like something hilarious you'd see in a South Park episode.

The dialogue is so horrendous that its really, really funny, its like nobody knows how to have a normal conversation. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deshanel have both acted well in other films but here they are given nothing to work with. The dialogue and some of the facial exprecions from these two main characters are so bad, at times you wonder if theres something wrong with them from the start of the movie. Oh and theres a little girl in this movie, whos left with the couple because her father suffers from the 'lets find a way to get me of this movie syndrome'! He leaves his daughter with them because he needs to go and find his wife because for some unkwown reason he thinks the little girl is safer with them... I guess? The little girl is given no charcter about her at all really and I don't recall her having much dialogue either. Also as you'd expect from an M. Night Shymalan film theres a really stupid plot twist at the end too which I won't spoil.

I'm a fan of M. Night Shymalan's earlier films. I like The Sixth Sence and Signs, and I particularly love Unbreakable, so its a real same to see him direct films like this one and The Last Airbender.

I'm rating this 2* instead of the 1* it probably deserves simply because it is a really funny film to watch if you just want to turn your brain off for 90 minutes and have a laugh at the attrocious writing. But for those who don't, this is definatly one to avoid.",1396396800,,2149,4.391959798994975

I'm not a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan - my favorite film by this director is ""Unbreakable"".

I think the central concept he had for ""The Happening"" was good.  The first half hour or so was pretty intriguing.  A scene in that first half hour involving some construction workers had me thinking that this was going to be a gripping, emotional roller coaster.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film is like a wobbly top, just teetering on the edge of tipping  towards too laughable (greenhouse guy) or too weird (crazy old loner lady) to be taken seriously, and it simply goes ""poof"" at the end.

I liked MW's performance, but  ZD's didn't do anything to advance her career, in my opinion.

1995109,4,6300248291,"""The Happening"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan seems to be disliked a lot by many of the reviewers here. As a result it doesn't score high at all in the star ratings. I feel however that many of these reviewers are a bit to harsh in their judgment of this film. Yes ""The Happening"" is not in the same league as Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"". Still I think this is a better movie then most people give it credit. It is certainly I feel a better movie then ""Lady In The Water"" which is my least favorite film by Shyamalan.

Shyamalan does a good job of telling a story here about something in the air that is affecting people so they go silently mad to the point of committing suicide. It all happens in the northeast part of the country. No one at first knows what is happening or why people are killing themselves at an alarming rate. At first it is believed it is the work of terrorists releasing some kind of bio-chemical in the air. But in time it comes to find out that it might be the plants and trees that are releasing something into the air causing all the chaos. I know the plot may sound a bit way out there but I find it to work. As the movie goes along the tension builds as people try to understand and solve the situation. As the film moves along people find more and more ways to kill themselves from sticking hairpicks into their jugular vain to jumping of buildings to laying down in front of a moving lawn mower to other gruesome forms of death. The scene where a man walks into the lions cage at the zoo quickly becomes blood curdling and could evoke screams from the viewer. I give this movie 4 stars because of the tense plot and suspense that builds up as the story goes along.

At the same time I only give the film 4 stars because I agree with some of the other reviewers that the acting is not the greatest. Mark Wahlberg, a fine actor to be sure, gives an ok performance but to me there are moments where he seems to be just going through the motions in his performance. Zooey Deschanel who plays Wahlberg's wife gives just a so-so performance but she too seems at times to be going through the motions. Betty Buckley however gives a good performance as Mrs. Jones and John Leguizamo also does a fine job as well. This is not an outstanding movie but still one I can recommend. Saying that however and knowing that there are many out there who totally disagree with me on this movie I would recommend before you buy ""The Happening"" you rent it or check it out at your local library and watch it first before you decide if you want to add this to your own video library.",1381363200,6,2612,4.274747474747475

It's like a race horse that started out fast and great, but then got old and slowed down and finally died while watching what happened to The Happening happen.

They called him the next Steven Spielberg when the hype for Signs was ramping up. What a joke. I wonder how he feels knowing that he crashed and burned, disappointed so many people, unknowingly lost his creative energy, and lost studio money. It must be a particularly cold feeling considering the way he virtually deified himself in The Lady in the Water, a movie that self-refutes because it has unbelievably high ambitions regarding art and the artist, and yet is so unbelievably poorly made.

This film is a very strange mix of straight horror, creepy atmosphere, and what must be tongue in cheek scripting. As another reviewer has noted, there is no way anyone would seriously pass a script about, basically, the apocalypse where people take it upon themselves to extol the virtues of hot dogs, or say ""Elliot's very resilient isn't he"".

The acting makes Jersey Shore look like the Royal Shakespeare Company, which again, must be partly intentional, surely. Wahlberg et al cruise through the end of the world looking like they just stepped out of a high street fashion shop window, and are more wooden than the mannequins. The 'conversation through a pipe' sequence near the end is simply preposterous, but the fact that the little girl is playing with a frog in a stone trough in a shed does at least add to the sense of the uncanny. That's right, a frog in a trough in a shed.

Somehow many of the creepy elements come off, and it's certainly well shot. Somehow the sense of dread does work, and for reasons that become clear, a sort of inverse claustrophobia is achieved, with green open spaces becoming threatening and curiously monstrous.

I wasn't excited by it, thrilled by it, terrified by it, happy or sad, about it; no, I just found it a quiet, interesting, journey through city and countryside in which, subtly, without visible cause, people began to kill themselves, to lose control, and no one could fathom why or protect themselves from having the same thing happen to them. It was death being dealt out by nature with no rhyme or reason. A fate with which none of our sciences or technologies could cope. It came, it happened, it went............like a meteorite which struck the Earth by chance and destroyed us for no reason but random selection. It need not have happened, but it did.

Directed abysmally. Take any cinematic term and pair it with a pejorative adjective or adverb and you'll be able to capture the putrescent essence of this ""film"" much more effectively than the director himself was able to do as he was presumably trying to steer this ramshackle, listing, sinking tugboat into some sort of  safe harbor. News-flash: the ship didn't even remotely make it to port. I can't believe I sat through this bilge without hanging myself by my own neck from the ceiling fan. My kingdom for a rope!

Look, I very much enjoyed 'The Sixth Sense,' was reasonably entertained by 'Signs,' and found 'The Village' tolerable. The fact that a big-shot director can plummet so precipitously from the lofty peak of such a promising start is far more disturbing and ""scary"" than anything you'll see in MNS's recent offerings, and especially in 'The Happening.' Even the title reeks of abject creative collapse. I understand that he tried to pass this off as some sort of ironic ""B-movie"" homage when the word spread of its awfulness (and word spread as quickly as suicide-vapors emanating from perturbed inner-city trees). The only irony is that almost any B-movie from the 1950s would look like a Matisse painting compared to this exercise in flatulence.

What happened to this man? Too much fame and money too quickly? A lobotomy procedure we never heard about? Did Satan promise him immortality at an eternal Vegas strip-club (with an open bar) in exchange for every last iota of talent left in his body? If so, then please make a movie about *that* story, dude. It would be light years more interesting than Mark Walhberg mincing through a performance more painful than the death of your most beloved pet and the harrowing indecency of being fooled into watching Zooey Bechamel try to ""act"" in anything at all.

Better yet, with the trajectory of ruin that Hollywood's Rocketship of Rotten is currently traveling and the box-office bombs falling one atop the other like dominoes, could someone start campaigning for a few cinematic standards before even greenlighting offal like this in the future? Huh? Moviegoers deserve better -- give some newcomers with actual talent, fresh ideas THAT HAVE A HINT OF VERISIMILITUDE and burning enthusiasm a chance. MNS has long overstayed his welcome. Make him test-drive his ""movies"" on You Tube before inviting him back to the rodeo.

Is our once-admirable cinematic/entertainment culture truly beyond wide-scale redemption? Don't answer that. I don't think I want to know the truth. I watched this on my night off, because I have always kept giving MNS amother chance despite so much evidence of a staggering decline, and I was genuinely insulted to find that 'The Happening' wasn't even ""so bad it's good"" bad.

1995130,1,6300248291,"The Happening is said to be the all-time low point in Shyamalan's career. It started with the village, but it was the Happening where it really started to hit us that M. Night Shyamalan is a hack director that peaked way to soon. The Happening is not only called one of the worst Shyamalan films, but one of the worst films in general. It is by no means a good movie, but it's not the worst movie I've ever seen either. I will say that I enjoy this more than the Village.

The one good thing about the film is the beginning. This movie started out really good actually. It starts out with random people just start killing themselves. There is this sense of mystery and suspense in the first part. The atmosphere is great also. Like most Shyamalan films, the film does have an interesting premise. However, like with most Shyamalan films, the execution of that premise is sorely lacking.

While the beginning was great it is ruined by the middle portion. During the middle half of the film they give an explanation for what is happening, which is one of the lamest explanations you can get. I would have preferred that you keep what was causing it a mystery, and let the viewer draw their own conclusions. The sense of mystery and intrigue is taken away by that lame explanation.

To make things worse the acting is atrocious, particularly by Mark Wahlberg. He is so over-the-top that scenes that are supposed to be taken seriously become unintentionally funny. The supporting cast are no better. Zooey Deschanel and the actress who played the little girl do a horrible job acting wise. There is no life in their performances. The background characters do a terrible job even. Some of the dialog is just so cheesy and corny!

Then during the third act of the film we spend a good chunk of time with this psycho granny. I felt I was watching a different movie. What was the point of the psycho granny plot element? She did not add anything to the plot.

Overall the Happening is a terrible film! It's one of Shyamalan's worst. I do enjoy it better than the Village. I like the premise more in this movie. Plus I at least can laugh at Mark Wahlberg's over-the-top performance. The Village was just a lifeless movie that I got no entertainment out of. I still do not recommend the Happening though.",1368057600,2,2294,4.544794188861985
1995131,4,6300248291,"Overall, this really is a horrible movie. But it has a sort of cheesy, otherworldly aspect to it that makes it an original and creative movie.

Is it an environmental film? Yes. Is it a movie about humanity? Yes. Is it science fiction? Hm, not really sure. It does have a ""Twilight Zone"" sort of plot, kind of a moment in time that everything gets turned upside down and no one really knows what's going on.

The main beef that I have with this movie is the acting. It's horrendous. If I were in this movie, I'd fit right in, because I've taken acting classes in college, and I'm a horrible actress. But it would have actually worked in this movie. Missed my moment...darn!

But I DO like that we and the characters in the movie don't really get any sort of explanation. It made me kind of wonder about what the movie was trying to say to its audience. And that's cool in a way, even with the atrocious acting and weird lines, (""Cheese and crackers"", a soldier says in amazement). The suicide scenes are creative, to say the least. It's not a fun movie, it's filled with all sorts of dismal scenarios that end with death. Some of them are totally disturbing, like the gardeners from Bill's Landscaping hanging by their from garden hoses from trees long after they've died. The way I see it, at least this movie gets some sort of a reaction from people, which is better than total indifference.

It's just a bizarre movie and there are some weird sub-plots thrown in for no particular reason other than s*** happens. But I can see some really interesting and redeeming points in it.

No one is certain, especially not Elliot Moore or the small group of survivors that have chosen to flee the cities, but wherever they go, the deadly contagion seems to follow. It is difficult to decide whether or not THE HAPPENING was actually intended to be a comedy or not, but if it was, M. Night Shyamalan certainly has a morbid sense of humor. One can't help but laugh at the deranged methods of dispatch that Shyamalan has chosen for his victims. He plays an even bigger joke on the audience by trying to pass Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo off as science teachers, which is even more unbelievable than his latest twist ending. It is unfair to say that THE HAPPENING is a terrible film when it successfully captivates one's sense of curiosity with the growing mystery and intrigue, but Shyamalan leaves us with no identifiable characters and a threadbare plot. The jarring suicides are a surprising change of pace, however, from the director's typically-benign scares.

From this point in my life I will never watch an M. Night Shyamalan film ever again.

1995170,1,6300248291,"I don't know about you, but seeing dozens of people on the Big Screen graphically and creatively committing suicide is not my idea of having a good time! But before I go any further, I want to strongly advise people who are severely depressed, or currently have issues with suicidal ideation (thinking/fantasies ) NOT to see this movie. The violence portrayed can be summed up in one word - harsh! The Happening is also wildly inappropriate for children and young teens! Consider this warning a Public Service announcement by someone who used to work with people in crisis!

Personally, it's sad to see Director Shyamalan stoop so low. His masterpiece, ""The Sixth Sense,"" is one of the greatest supernatural fantasy films of all time! He obviously likes to work in this genre, and there are plenty of stories written along these lines over the past hundred years to tap into for ideas! But no, he most follow the majority of Hollywood and dumb down his films, too! The Happening will certainly make Director Shyamalan a quick buck, but it will also damage his brand. He's slowing and steadily becoming the ""Roger Coreman"" of schlock film making. I, for one, will certainly think twice before paying my hard earned money to see another one of his films in the future!

The story is also so preposterous it comes across ultimately as campy. Intelligent plants are so smart they only wipe out people from Maryland to Massachusetts, as a ""warning"" against mankind's abuse of the environment! The plant kingdom is only defending it's self from our wanton destruction of the environment. But they can't be all that smart if they attack one of our nation's most environmentally friendly regions in the United States! For example, the LARGEST park in the entire United States, outside of Alaska, is in New York State and it's a STATE park, called the Adirondacks. It's even in the State Constitution to remain forever wild! New York City and the surrounding environs, has some of the cleanest drinking water in the United States. One of the greatest zoos in the entire world, which works tirelessly to save endangered species, and to educate the rest of us is the BRONX Zoo! New York State dismantled its last built nuclear power plant, called Shoreham, before it was even turned on! So my dear, Shyamalan, The Schlockmeister, you had your pathetic plant kingdom army attack the wrong part of the country! Duh!

No one is denying that there's an audience for this kind of intense violence and stupidity, but there's a much larger audience for intelligent story making. Hopefully, The Happening will take a drubbing at the box office and teach this formerly bright filmmaker a valuable lesson!

lowest SAT scores in US history... gauging that most viewers/reviewers are from
the US.

Soon after this a mysterious breeze hits New York, specifically Central Park where people start to kill themselves (one lady even jabs a pen into her neck) and from then on it seems clear that the planet is quite unhappy with how people have been and are currently treating it so why not create something that causes us to lose our will to live.

Elliot and his somewhat jaded wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel, ""(500) Days of Summer"") along with a few others try to escape to safety and stay alive despite all this chaos. They go through the nearby countryside where Elliot keeps trying to find ways to simply explain what is happening to the planet and why people are doing what they're doing. The pro-earth propaganda just is sickening, the story is just plain silly, no scares, not good acting by anyone, people just run off and do their own thing which is usually the dumbest thing. Like when Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo, ""Moulin Rouge"") goes into the city to get his loved ones despite knowing he has no chance to make it, once a hole is punctured in the roof of the car, the bad air gets in and soon after he thankfully off's himself.

The plants and trees rebel against mankind. They shiver and shake and spit out a toxin that makes people kill themselves. At one point the star pleads with a plant to not kill him, until he realizes it`s just harmless plastic. Then there's a strange shot of two old ladies knitting while wearing gas masks. (Looks like comedy to me.) But we're also made privy to ghastly and bloodied suicide scenes, such as a man who lays down in front of a moving corn thrasher. I didn`t understand why the driver didn`t kill himself too since he was exposed to the same suicidal toxin.  Bad drama, right?

On the run, Walberg and company stumble upon an isolated cabin occupied by a crazy old woman who lives alone and sleeps with a life-sized female doll. (WTH?) Obviously insane and mentally unstable, she accuses her guests of plotting to murder her while she sleeps. When she demands that they leave her home they refuse and try to reason with her. It made no sense. That lunatic was ten-times more frightening than the quivering trees.

I don't know how many people shot themselves in the head, but at least one rammed a hair pin through her neck. This is some sick stuff, folks.

Cut to Marky Mark, a high school teacher in Philly who is making his kids fail their SATs by filling their heads with nonsense about disappearing bees. Are the bees related? What do you think? When the news of this potential bio-terrorist attack hits the school, Mark decides for some reason to get on a train with his not-quite-clear-how-estanged wife. More deaths follow, the train stops en route.

A bunch of third-tier characters kill themselves in imaginatively gruesome ways and Mark uses his science teaching skills to figure out the virus is highly communicable and travels through the air. Genius. A botanist whom he happens across tells him: it's the plants - they've had enough of our non-recycling polluting ways and oak trees are throwing the kill switch on humans. And he believes that. So what better way to escape than with a bunch of strangers spending the next 20 minutes of screen time walking across a field? More people die, surprisingly enough, and their group gets ever-smaller. Wahlberg's performance here spawned a series of sketches in SNL where he talks to chickens and road signs, it's just that good.

Finally they reach the house of a crazy old hermit woman who harasses the hell out of them, forcing some high school-level acting from almost everyone in the same scene. She dies too. In a relationship moment, Mark's wife tells him about some tiramisu she ate with another guy and wonders if that's cheating. The next day, they leave the house and mysteriously the virus has completely gone, just like the $10 from my wallet and *just like a scientist on a TV report at the beginning said it would*. They live.

In the epilogue set in Paris (the first time M has stepped outside of Philly for a long time), stereotypical French people are walking next to the Eiffel Tower, carrying baguettes and garlic and probably smoking too.

I'm not saying that the critics are never right, but in my case anyway, my critique is usually the polar opposite of the critics'. I've also found, many times, that my tastes in movies are not the same as anyone else's, as is the reverse of that equation, and as it should be. To each his own, which is actually a good thing.

I really though back in the early aughts that Shyamalan was going to reinvent the common thriller/horror film and make it something unique and inspired.  I also really thought that he was going to win an Oscar shortly after he lost to Sam Mendez back in 1999.  By now though, his swift embrace by the Academy over the surprise hit that was `The Sixth Sense' seems premature and almost foolish.  He's dropped his ball so far I fear that bending over to pick it up may cause him to hit his head and die.

`The Happening' is retarded.

The mere premise of this film is actually somewhat inspired.  I mean, the idea that the plants, in an effort to protect themselves from the threat of humanity, have adapted to producing a toxin that causes humans to go temporarily insane and then commit suicide is kind of genius.  From the outset, it would feel like Shyamalan is finding his niche again.  Sadly, the buck stops there and the rest of the `ingredients' are so awfully concocted that the film becomes a massive joke.

Completely LOL at Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant.

The dialog is ridiculous (hotdogs, really), the acting is horrendous (I love you Zooey, but your comedic approach to this material is distracting) and the plot development is too sporadic for its own good.  Seriously, who is going to believe Wahlberg as a teacher?  I mean, it's honestly distracting.  My dreams of Shyamalan regaining his momentum initially garnered back in 1999 have been abolished over the past few years.  I mean, what is wrong with him?  I will say this; he can direct a chilling sequence (that scene in the creepy house with that nut-job old woman was effectively intense) but he can't write to save his life.  He needs to let someone else write his work from now on.",1334275200,2,2059,4.73314606741573

I could see the anxiety and puzzlement on their faces. In another scene, it shocked me when the kid was shot in the face after he banged on the door of the house.

The thing that let me down the most was the love between Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. There's some chemistry between them but it's not portrayed strong enough. If it had been, it would have made the movie more touching and lovely.

Zooey asks Mark, ""Are you joking?"" and he can barely nod yes. The billboard reads You Deserve This. The actors are gifted but the performances are stale, quite a feat in itself. This is a B-Movie with a Hollywood budget that does not take itself seriously.

If you are a fan of the likes of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" with Shatner or those I'm A Certain Number of Feet Tall 50's sci-fi/horror movies, then I think The Happening will speak to you perfectly well.

Let me finish, okay? Give me a second, give me a second. So this is the idea, right? The plants are out to get us.

Q.

No, it's not because we're eating them.  If it was because of that, like the COWS would be throwing themselves off buildings. It's because we're screwing up the planet, you know, with all this nuclear crap, and all the other stuff we're doing, so the plants are going to release, this, like wind or something, this chemical, this neurotoxin that like totally turns off our ability to protect ourselves.

Q

Well, we kill ourselves with hairpins and lawn mowers and lions and stuff, that just rip your arms off, that's what happens. And it's all because we're like in GROUPS, so we have to not be in groups, or whatever, or maybe it's even going to HAPPEN if we're not in groups, even if we're like crazy people that talk to plants, cause they can hear us, they can sense us, like a kind of sixth sense. But first, before we off ourselves with, you know, windows or whatever, we stand still, and we walk backwards a little, oh yeah, and we repeat ourselves.

I wish I'd read these Amazon reviews first.",1311984000,,307,4.773584905660377
1995239,3,6300248291,"I've always been a fan of Shyamalan's style of filmmaking (crisp long take, deep focus shot; sparse edits; and a reliance on silence), even though I've not been a fan of all of his films. My reasons for liking ""The Happening"" probably have to do with the fact that my expectations were so low when I first saw it because 1) The reviews were so bad, and 2) I despised his last two films ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water."" I was surprised to find how much of the film didn't suck.

1) Cinematography/editing/music

There were a number of scenes that were actually very well photographed and edited. The opening scene in Central Park and at the construction site were very well done (my sister, who hated the movie, even said the construction site scene was creepy). I thought John Leguizomo's last scene was very effective, what with the single long take of the jeep crashing into the tree and Leguizomo emerging from the vehicle, sitting on the road, and slicing his wrists. I wasn't sure at all how they accomplished that in one single take, and I enjoyed learning how they did it in the behind the scenes documentary.

And I just LOVED the musical score by James Newton Howard. The opening credits tune was quite chilling, as was the piece where the woman in the end rammed her head into the window. From a purely technical perspective, I thought the movie was very well done.

2) The Premise

I actually liked the premise. It was nutty, audaciously so, and I got a kick out of it.

3) The screenplay

Needed some work. I did not like the dialogue between Elliot and Alma in the train station. It was actually better in the film's original draft. Instead of Ms. Zooey whining: ""I don't like to put my feelings out there for people to see. I'm not that type of persooooon,"" the original draft had her glare at Wahlberg and whisper: ""We should finish talking about this first before you ask other people's opinions."" Less dialogue, much more effective.

There were also some glaring plot holes too big to ignore. For example, when the main characters get stuck at the intersection with a large group of people (in a heavily forested area, no less), nothing happened to anyone in the group. It isn't until they break up into two seperate groups that ""The Happening"" takes effect. Later on we learn that large groups set off the toxin, so why is it the toxin didn't affect anyone when they were all stuck in the intersection? Why did it wait until they broke into two groups?

On the other hand, there were scenes and characters I did like. I liked the strange man who ran the plant farm (""You like hotdogs, don't you?"") and I liked the scene where Wahlberg ""forgives"" his wife for a little white lie she told him by telling her how he almost bought a ""completely superfluous bottle of cough syrup."" I liked the scene where Wahlberg cheers up the little girl by letting her try on his beloved mood ring. I liked the scene where Wahlberg and Deschanel talked about their first date during the climax, and when she first tried on the mood ring (I crack up when she says how her color was purple, and what the color actually means).

The screenplay was far from perfect, but there were enough moments that did work that made it worthwhile for me.

4) The Acting

Hit-and-Miss. John Leguizomo turned in the best performance, although he was given little to do. Wahlberg and Deschanel were fine, save for the scene in the train station at the very beginning. It was far from their best work, but it certainly wasn't their worst, either. The only performance that grated the nerves for me was little Ashlyn Sanchez. I liked her in Crash; I did not like her here.

5)Directing

It worked for me. The movie unfolds in a very deliberate pace, as do all of Shyamalan's films, but I thought it never dragged. It is a well made movie, and I did like the atmosphere Shyamalan gives the material. I thought it worked.

Overall:

As far as movies of this genre go, ""The Happening"" is really not that bad. It's flawed, yes, but it kept me engaged to the very end. While certainly not his best film (that honor still lies with ""The Sixth Sense""), it also isn't his worst either (""The Last Airbender"" holds that title; now THAT was one of the worst movies of all time!).

The original premise seemed pretty promising, I.e. the worlds plants feeling threatened by the encroaching human population, so it releases a neurotoxin that induces people to commit suicide, but the execution of this idea is dire.

The writing is simply terrible, with poor story development, lack of full explanation and unnatural dialogue. The acting is terrible, with cringe making wooden performances, Zooey Deschanel is especially bad, when I`ve seen her act so well in the past. The direction is terrible, with inaccuracies (such as someone shooting themselves with a gun and then the camera pans forwards to see the gun metres in front of the person) and annoying full face to camera angles.

Now, I'm going to confine my review to THE HAPPENING -- allowing my evaluation of it to be based on that film alone, and not in comparison to his others.

THE HAPPENING is a moody, atmospheric, claustrophobic and paranoidal film. It is a creepy journey through a world threatened with an ""ultimate threat"". It is not meant to be a naturalistic nor realistic film, rather a symbolic or impressionistic one. Some have labeled it as ""environmental propaganda"" -- clearly the mere cursory mention of ""green house effect"" toward the start of the film is enough to set some people into near-catatonic fits of rage! I merely viewed THE HAPPENING as a ""what if"" scenario, an imaginative tale exploring several characters faced with a crisis that seems to be caused by nature. In short, it is ""only a movie"" -- feel free to keep saying it to yourself if you need the comfort! Shyamalan could have easily chosen zombies (as in Romero's  NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) or  technology (as in Stephen King's CELL, for example)or Martian's (WAR OF THE WORLDS) or even cannibals (Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD) as his ""ultimate threat"". Obviously, Shyamalan's muse or inspiration came in the form of nature. It's a funny thing, artistic inspiration. Ten writers can look at an apple on a table, for instance, and who knows what ideas are/are not triggered by said apple!

I myself sat down to watch THE HAPPENING having heard/been told so many terrible things about it. I chose to view it with an open mind. I also chose to watch it on my own, allowing myself to be immersed in the world presented. The atmosphere that Shyamalan and co. create is palpable (Say what you like about M. Night, but he is truly a master of mood, so important in the types of films he makes).

I truly enjoyed this film. It IS moody, it IS mysterious, it IS harrowing. In a pandemic situation, the wind WOULD BE menacing and nightmarish (a chainsaw-wielding maniac in a dead-skin mask is not the only type of menace that has the propensity to rattle the nerves).

I also found the relationship between Elliot and Alma very heartfelt and involving. The ""mystery"" of their circumstances was definitely a key element in the effectiveness of this film. M. Night's choice of ending for these two character's was a very wise one indeed. Another of Night's strengths is in developing normal people and thrusting them into such extra-ordinary circumstances, of making you believe in and care about them (much like Stephen King). All one need do is forget the expectation/hype (informed by previous work/s) and just enjoy the experience.",1298246400,4,2745,4.780590717299578

These same people would hate ""Avatar"" if they understood it. We all know there is significant portion of the population that has convinced themselves they have a ""right"" to destroy nature and poison the world. They claim  the world was created for them! Besides they argue, the world is going to end soon anyways, so who cares? Thats why our economy has hit the skids - these people just don't care what they destroy. Its all about them, its all about satisfying their whims instantly. The idea that you might have to actually THINK about a movie really upsets them. What ( obviously) really enrages them is that the environment - the biosphere - might fight back! Especially it might fight back in a completely effective way, targeted just at humans, and the attack would be so rapid that we would have no defense at all. Yet as all intelligent people know, thats exactly what will happen. Not this way, but thru a pandemic. We have too many people living in densely crowded areas (and no health care). The 1918 flu was amazing as a killer. By the time we recognize a pandemic is happening, it will have spread every where. There will be no medical care, no government assistance - of any kind. Everyone you meet could be the one who passes the killer virus to you - so everyone becomes an lethal enemy! Seen in that way, this movie is a wonderful metaphor. There are lots of subtle lessons - such as the heavily armed survivalists who turn out to be exactly what we all know they are - psychotic killers! And the people who completely isolate themselves (Gee, who does that in our society? Duh!!!) turn out to be completely crazy. The people who survive are going to be the ones who are smart and adaptable - and who love each other, not just themselves. This movie perfectly captures the distress and helplessness of our culture confronted with something they can't possibly fight - and which they created by their own destructiveness. Its not really an action movie - but there is lots of action. The ""suicides"" are very disturbing - VERY. Thats another reason why this film bothers so many people. That same group of people think they are in control of everything all the time ( which is why drugs make them wet their pants!). The idea that they would lose control of their minds ( and god would let it happen - oh my!) is profoundly disturbing. People make light of the idea that the ""wind"" would be scary missed Shylaman's use of the wind in his other films. Re-watch ""The Village."" Wind ( air) will be incredibly scary in a pandemic!

Having said that, it succeeded in being pretty comical. At times, in fact, it was effing hilarious. The perfect storm of dubious direction, asinine scripting, and poor acting on Mark Wahlberg's part.

BUT ask yourself if Wahlberg did not stumble into a moment of accidental genius. This was so unbelievably absurd that if you approach it as being an off-beat comedy it works quite well, and by off-beat I mean so-awful-its-good. I don't know if this was intentional on M. Night's part. If so, then he deserves applause for this. However the impression I get from some interviews is that he actually takes 'The Happening' seriously. All the same, I find it unbelievable that he could not have thought that this was worse than bad after the first screening.

I genuinely believe this will become a cult classic, if for no other reason than for the ""what? no!"" line. If you have not seen this movie then it probably sounds like a line that could not in any way be laughable. But believe me, it is beyond funny!

How can I explain The Happening without giving anything away?
People begin to kill themselves in New York City. Authorities believe it to be a kind of terrorist attack.

You're then introduced to Mark Walhberg's character, Elliot Moore, is a high school science teacher. He's joined by his co-worker/friend Julian (John Leguizamo), Julian's daughter Jess, and Elliot's wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel).

The school where Elliot and Julian work decide to release the students when they hear of the attack. The main characters decide to take a train away from Philly. While on the train they hear of the attacks spreading throughout the Northeastern part of the United States.

There seems to be no way of escaping this event. Everywhere they go, people are killing themselves. How will anyone survive?

I'm a fan of Shyamalan's films. I enjoy his ability to tell a story. All of his films have a message to them and you'd have to be pretty slow not to catch on to what he's trying to say. And I have to tell you, it goes much deeper than ""treat the earth with respect"". People who jump on the bandwagon denouncing this movie as a global warming protest have simply missed the message.

Having enjoyed the film, there are a few things that really irked me. Many critics have panned the acting. I go back to what I said earlier, this is not your average film. Don't expect your macho/hero man type talk. But I did have a problem with Mark Wahlberg's character. Maybe it was because he's always around teenagers, but every line sounded like it came from a fifteen year old. It wasn't enough to ruin my experience, it was just a noticiable irk. Second came from Zooey Deschanal. If her character was written like that, than it was just a poor choice. If it was her level of acting...I hope to avoid her films. She was the worst of the small ensemble.

**Edit** Having thought about it for a while, I have come to the conclusion that the way they were acting: like children was part of the deeper meaning Shyamalan was trying to bring out. When you watch this movie, watch how childish these two ""adults"" act. And then see how they become real adults...**end edit**

John Leguizamo was fantastic, but when is he not? I wanted to see more of him. Maybe he should have been the main character and Walhberg his buddy.

This film is rated R and for very good reasons; Shyamalan keeps the camera on the suicide moments a second too long which create a serious feeling of dread. The other reason is because you see two teenage boys murdered with a shotgun. Anytime a minor is killed in a film, the ratings go deeper into R territory.

I really enjoyed watching this movie. Along with the sheer dread saturating the run time there were a couple ""Shyamalan"" moments of jump-out-of-your-seats scares.

It is rated R so be warned - and, like I said, if you see it, see it with your Shyamalan glasses on (look for the deeper meaning).",1294099200,4,3194,4.595782073813708

This is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen. I just can't believe that anyone would say something bad about this movie, unless you are a wuss and are scared like a 5 year old. I remember being a kid and watching horror films with my family and even though I knew that I was going to have nightmares, I still watched it because I'm a sucker for blood and gore. I really hate so-called ""horror films"" that have a bunch of lovey dovey crap in them and very little blood and gore. This movie does not fit that category because it is so disturbing.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

Anyway, so it's already happening and we're gradually introduced to the focal characters. They leave the city, run around in the country-side for a bit until it's no longer happening, then go on with their lives as usual. Yup, I really did just sum the movie up. It's not a bad movie, in and of itself. What I mean by that is the production is very good (just look at all they work they put into creating a realistic car crash), the main characters are likable, and the threat is at least a little unsettling. However, other than a few graphic suicides, there really isn't any sense of a pressing threat bearing down on them. I know what you're thinking and I really wouldn't count being chased by the breeze as being terribly horrific or scary. In fact, those specific scenes make the movie feel a tad silly. In the first place, bushes and trees cannot stir or direct the wind. And do I even need to bring up how ludicrous an idea it seems, having the 'toxins' be selectively released by plants to target specific people and then the 'toxins' magically vanish? It would have been much more plausible and a lot more suspenseful if the threat were more persistent. And why not have it be caused by some chemical weapons leak in a government research facility? That, to me, would be much more realistic and scary than the idea of nature spontaneously evolving the ability to make people commit suicide. There's something about scientists playing with nature and creating monsters that, if done well, is one of the most chilling things I can think of. Anyone who's read Koontz's book, Watchers, will know what I mean... this movie could have been something like that, but it's not. Whatever is supposedly in the air is too vaguely defined and short-lived to feel truly menacing. The ending is also anti-climactic; the threat magically dissipates right when the lead couple are prepared to die, there's a jump of a few months, and now life is back to normal. So much for trying to be scary. In light of the way it ends, this movie does tend to rub off with the feeling of an ecological warning message, and a silly one at that. ""Better start recycling and stop cutting down trees before nature decides to fight back!""

I would honestly have to say that Unbreakable and The Village are the only exceptional movies M. Night has directed. I should re-watch The 6th Sense, because I really don't remember it as being very remarkable. I look on pretty much all the rest of his work as either just plaid weird or mediocre. I declined seeing The Last Airbender, and apparently that was a good call on my part. I never got into the Anime, but it seems that a lot of the fans of the original series were thoroughly disappointed by Shyamalan's treatment.

Observation: The film that repeatedly comes to mind when watching ""The Happening"" is the short film-within-a-film ""Mant."" (See it's excellent parent film, ""Matinee"" if you haven't). ""Mant"" (which is on YouTube) would be the perfect first half of a double-feature with ""The Happening."" It would get you in the perfect mood to enjoy Schyamalanlong's catastrophe. Just do it. You'll see what I mean.

Idea: Imagine the pi$$ed-off ghost of Rod Serling and/or Alfred Hitchcock deciding to terrorize the family of a popular but fading Hollywood director who has been shamelessly ripping off their styles and ideas. Maybe add another dead filmmaker (Kubrick?) and could make it a ""Christmas Carol""-like moral tale. Or just make it a gory splatter flick and let Rod and Alfred take gleeful revenge.

1995276,2,6300248291,"Ok, i am a fan of Shyamalan. I love The Sixth Sense, Signs and Lady in the Water. I still have yet to see The Village. I will defend Shyamalan's films, before this one. And i did see the Last Airbender, meh the action was cool, but the acting, not really, and I love the series, so this is coming from a fan of the source material. I will prefer The Last Airbender more than The Happening.

-Pros of The Happening:
The all around feeling of this film makes you feel that you are in danger and have no way out. And the plot is great. It gets me thinking. The performances of some of the actors are somewhat good.
-Cons of the Happening:
The execution of this all around plot is so bad that the only nice touch is them in a field. The twist which brings out the reason this mass suicide is happening is bad, just because of the reason itself: Plants. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor, but the ""What No"" part was an example that actors can mess up. And Zooey Deschanel did a great performance, but her reaction when the kids got shot annoyed me.

Overall this movie has more cons than pros. which means this film is bad. If you have nothing to do but watch it, you can, but if you have a choice to watch this and basically any other suspense film by Shyamalan, don't go for it. Watch the trailer, cause that's more entertaining than the movie itself (i in fact love the trailer, but don't like the movie).",1282521600,2,1399,4.197026022304833

1995278,3,6300248291,"This has to be one of the most perplexing movie watching experiences I have ever had. There are some parts of this movie that I thought were brilliant and a whole lot that was complete crap. It was so inconsistent. I have seen plenty of films that sucked (ala Twilight, New Spoon) and I have seen plenty that kicked ass. But I have never seen a film that had me laughing one minute and scratching my head the next and completely angry the next.

  *Spoilers*

  One reason for this is the senseless violence. There is nothing wrong with violence, even graphic violence, in the proper place and for the proper emotional impact. But this movie totally ham-fists this area into the ground. I don't need to be show the guy getting run over by the lawnmower (fake looking by the way). Show him starting it up, show it coming, but let my imagination do the rest. Lead me up to the cliff, but don't push me over. Let me hear the crunching as he slides under, his screams. A violent act induces all the senses, not just sight. Showing too much, paradoxically, lessens the impact of the violent event. Also, as I said previously about continuity, keep the tone surrounding the violence consistent. I was completely gobsmacked by the scene where the two boys are gunned down at point blank range by the shotgun. Why show me? Utterly inappropriate. Even worse than this, the next scene cuts two these two ladies donning cold-era style gas masks while watching the six-o-clock news. This would have been a really funny scene in any other context, very tongue in cheek and reminiscent of some of the scenes in Signs, but because it was placed right next to the scene of these horrific murders, it completely fails. I am not in the mood to laugh after seeing someone murdered, are you?

  And more scenes just like these.

  Other things that sucked: the plot was very thin. The first twenty minutes of dialogue was horrendous; I could feel Shyamalan breathing over my neck delivering every line, followed by ""did you get it? wasn't that clever? Aren't I a clever guy?"" After that the actors seemed to take over and have personalities. I thought Mark Wahlburg and Zooey Deschanel did a great job. I loved every minutes of Deschanel. But back to the sucking. I hated the lame ending. Let me beat you over the head with the message again. And let me not tie anything up or explain anything because nature can't be explained. This ultimately is not a happening, but an end of the world story. Finishing up the movie and then faking like your moving on only to have the world end again (in France, no less) really pisses me off. Also, the cgi in this movie sucked. I hated it and it sticks out like a sore thumb to me.

  Things I liked: Awesome crazy lady in ramshackle house. This whole sequence was incredible and very well done, right up until the part where they go outside to die together. Loved it. (Didn't love the ridiculous ""gee I guess we missed the plague cause it shut down one minute before we came out, and aren't we luck! Well, let's go back inside and wash the brown Hershey squirts from our trousers and have some cookies and punch."") I thought the part where she slaps the little girls hand was brilliant. In fact, her whole performance was amazing. When she comes in on Mark in the morning and goes nuts, well, that was completely disturbing. I also love the scene where he is talking to the plastic tree. Wonderful!

I really liked this movie because it was suspenseful and moved along at a fast clip, but it's definitely not in the same league as The Sixth Sense. That was a gripping movie, filled with eerie, frightening happenings and great acting.

The opening scene of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001DZOC6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>&nbsp;occurs in Central Park on a bustling, normal day. Two young women are chatting on a bench when suddenly all the others ""freeze in their tracks."" The girls are puzzled, but before her friend can stop her one girl sticks a sharp object in her throat and commits suicide. Thus begins a rash of suicides, construction workers jumping off girders in unison, police officers pulling their own guns and killing themselves... As the media and bureaucratic professionals try to understand and explain what's happening in the mid-Atlantic Coast states, people are fleeing the cities in droves.

The movie follows one couple, their friend and his daughter as they join with other survivors along the road west... As they strive to stay alive, their band gets smaller and smaller as people die off all around them, all by suicide. It proves to be ""something in the air"" and as they run for their lives, they learn little by little how to protect themselves. But the neuro-toxins in the wind finally catch up to them and...but this is one of the best scenes and I can't describe it without giving the plot away.

Even though this film had little graphics--simply an eerie wind blowing through the foliage--that, the pace and the music made it tense enough for me. And the good actors made it believable; just normal people with a fair share of problems trying to survive a disaster.

In my opinion, this is definitely not a horror movie; rather, it's a thought-provoking, creepy film that makes me wonder if something like this could really happen. There is a sweet love story between the married main characters that gives a satisfactory ending to the mid-Atlantic happening. And a frightening twist at the very end that gives the viewer further cause to wonder.

Not a masterpiece by any means, but it was very entertaining.

1995286,4,6300248291,"Maybe I'm the last one standing, but I am a rabid fan of Shyamalan and his obsession with taking horror/fantasy stories and giving them an A-list treatment.  In ""The Happening"", Shyamalan tells the story of a high school teacher (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife (Zooey Daschanel) getting caught up in a catatrophic event where people fall under an unseen force that drives them to suicide.  ""The Happening"" was ravaged by critics, and while it made a tidy profit at the box office, it was not the blockbuster Shyamalan has become accustomed to.  This is a shame, because it is an accomplished and skillfull thriller that is very creepy and touching, and it does have the distinction of being his first R-rated feature (the gore is quite gruesome).  I like the way Shyamalan portrays the possible end of days, very quiet, sudden, and hitting hard before people even realize the seriousness of their situation.  The film blames toxins secreted by plants into the air as a strike against man for their cruel ways . . .sounds like the stuff of B-movies, which it is, but Shyamalan takes this story and puts the experience through the eyes of ordinary people (just as in Signs), making it chilling, very relatable, and suspenseful.  Mark Wahlberg is excellent in the lead.  He never becomes an action superhero or unrealistically smart, but instead his character's heroism somes from how he safeguards his wife and his best friend's daughter whom is charged with watching.  The Blu ray edition of this film is excellent.  Presented in 1080p, 1:85 aspect, the film demonstrates good color saturation, inky blacks, and strong detail.  The veneer of film grain renders further details in fabrics, facial features, and textures.  The DTS-MA HD lossless soundtrack is robust, sometimes bass-heavy, which superv ambient effects, especially in handling the wind gusts an rustling trees on the soundtrack.

I personally have never thought his movies to be particularly good and believe the Sixth Sense, because of its effect on pop movies, and Unbreakable to be his best.  Neither film is great by any means.  The director has been treading water for some time now and I believe even die hard fans would admit this.  That said, the director drowns with this picture.  It is pure claptrap.  It is mental ""thrust tugging"" that doesn't backfire because it doesn't make any sense.  The plot is terrible.  The actors are not only miscast (neither lead could have played their role, even if well written, and hey, I like Wahlberg), but they act terribly.  The writing is terrible.  Ed Wood has most definitely written better films than this.  At least he believed in his work.  There is no believing in this piece of crap.  How bad is the writing?

 The idea of Mother Nature not taking it anymore was the driving force behind ""The Birds"".  It is not only a similar motive here, but may even be more likely.

1995292,2,6300248291,"There are forces at work beyond our understanding, like those behind the casting director's ability to get any semi-competent actor to take part in this garbage.  Another unexplained force would be, considering the last good movie he made was Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan's popularity.  With enough pseudo-science about plant-life having self-preservation mechanism, and the ability to launch airborne neurotoxins from their spores, or something like that, this movie may as well have been the sequel to The Inconvenient Truth.

Poor speech and disorientation are the first signs of this floral terrorist attack, meaning Bobcat Goldwaithe and drunks walking out of bars would be in serious danger.  A decent cast with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, as Elliot and Alma Moore, is the only reason to watch this film.  Given nearly nothing script-wise by writer/director M. Night, the acting is nonetheless very intense.  Seriously, the script is the stuff of bar napkins.  Better yet, graffiti scribblings on toilet walls.  If not for a series of shocking suicides, which are, admittedly, jaw-dropping, the movie serves as nothing more than environmental mumbo-jumbo.  If Shyamalan wanted to make plants and wind scary (which they absolutely weren't in this film), he should have taken a page from The Ruins or The Wizard of Oz, respectively.

Ten reasons this movie sucks (there could easily be more):
1) The man vs. lion scene is atrociously done, so fake I gave myself a migraine when I rolled my eyes.
2) Suspense requires, well, suspense.  Telling the surprise ending at the beginning is stupid.  Why not just show Bruce Willis as a ghost in the first scene of The Sixth Sense?
3) When there is a lovelorn subplot involving the two main characters of the film, and it's given absolutely no depth, it should be left on the cutting-room floor.
4) When a train stops in the upper NE of the U.S., the reason given is that they've lost contact with, ""everyone.""  Given that the effects of this ""outbreak"" only attacked the same region, why would they stop when they could easily contact the rest of America, let alone the rest of the world.
5) People can't outrun the wind.
6) When escaping from the wind, it's wise to know that old houses have very poor insulation
7) The over-the-top preaching about humans destroying the planet is insufferable.  I'm going to drive my SUV through a wheat field just to spite Shyamalan.
8) The psychotic, reclusive yokel Mrs. Jones is a pointless addition, and if anything, should have been spared by the film's ""logic.""
9) Pointless plot insertions like a communications pipe between Mrs. Jones main house and a shed outback is sloppily inserted just for future use later.  The same goes for everyone in the film with a gun.
10) Aside from constantly being in the running for Razzies, this film has the distinct pleasure of easily having one of the worst ten endings in cinema history.",1264809600,2,2924,4.938775510204081

There are few movies that are so bad that after viewing them I have felt horribly used and offended.

Some have said that this film is intentionally bad, as if to obtain some ""B"" movie status. I only wish that this was the case, as I would have been fine with that premise. While watching this Several times, in fact, I literally asked others in the room, ""is this for real?"" or ""is this movie intentionally bad?"" Just because it is intentionally bad does not make it worthy of ""cult classic"" status. Sometimes bad films just should be avoided. Such is the case with this movie. Worth avoiding at all costs.

The acting is indeed terrible. Shamefully bad. A cringe making nightmare most of the time.

The story is absurd, disjointed, senseless and for lack of a better word just stupid beyond all excuse.

Let me say this movie isn't ""so bad it's funny"" it is so bad it sucks. Boring, stupid, aimless with a last minute warning about the planet at the end that will leave you shaking your head in disgust.

If it was intentionally bad then why would they show scenes such as when the young boy gets a shotgun in the chest? Is that some sort of joke? I could point out several scenes in the movie that suggest that the film is not a tongue in cheek joke.

But the worst part of the movie by far, even though there is no real story, is the miserable performances by, well, everybody. The miserable, senseless dialog delivered by the zombie-like actors and actresses is frustratingly bad. Nearly all the lines are spoken with a bizarre expressionless stupor on their faces. Again, not funny bad, just really bad. Frustratingly bad.

Roger E. is clearly insane. I read his review and was completely baffled. I will never trust his reviews again, EVER. He never indicates in his review that he feels this is intentionally bad. His political views (read his review if you don't believe me) drove him to misrepresent this film.

I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",1262563200,5,2021,4.545454545454546
1995296,3,6300248291,"I make no secrets in that I am a huge M.Night Shyamalan fan. From THE SIXTH SENSE to THE VILLAGE, I've enjoyed how his movies involve and wind me up. I was not too kind with my review of LADY IN THE WATER, as I found the movie to be a complete mess only saved from total disaster by its lensing and atmosphere. When I heard he was making another thriller called THE HAPPENING, I was hoping he would redeem himself. While I wasn't totally impressed, I will have to give credit where credit is due and say that THE HAPPENING succeeded on many levels, while coming dangerously close to total disaster.

The premise is that something strange in the air is causing humans to lose their ability for self-preservation and find any way possible to kill themselves. The movie presents this unfolding drama quite well, especially the early scene with the construction workers. The movie earned an R rating for many of these scenes but they aren't quite R-Rated as perhaps some of the moments in Fox's FRINGE.

The movie moves along quite well, often presenting the paranoia with finesse and always in the ""wind you up"" method that M.Night Shyamalan is famous for. I for one was brought into the situation and found myself even holding my breath a few times when the toxin was near. The discoveries they found and each turn kept me interested. The scene with the kids at the boarded up house was a shocker that broke some taboos in movie making.

What brought the movie down a few ratings for me was mainly the Mrs. Jones house scene. Here, the movie went into quirky mode and with some very bad acting, it almost brought the movie down to its knees. The scene where she thought our heroes would kill her in her sleep and Wahlberg's response of ""Noooo...noooo"" was extremely laughable. It almost seemed like a rehearsal scene. Poorly acted. When Mrs. Jones accuses Wahlberg of stealing her doll was another quirky moment. Why Zooey Deschanel is still cast in major roles is a mystery to me. She is not that great of an actress and often a one trick pony. Add to this the ""comic relief"" of showing people in gas masks and huddling in their tubs and the movie was about to be done for me. But the location shots of Mrs. Jones house and the anti-climatic but still pleasant ending saved the movie.

I liked THE HAPPENING and I eagerly await Shyamalan next thriller. I just hope he takes his time and can wow us again like he did with THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS.",1262217600,,2446,4.489887640449438

 There was no ending.  really truly no ending.

 This was just a venue to find as many different ways to kill people as possible, for no reason.

To have love or need love or to need or be needed by someone is to have purpose. It drives us but subconsiously we do not know it. The reason the couple lived was because the represented units that actually need each other to live. There are people in this world that require such and cannot sustain themselves alone.

1995302,2,6300248291,"There's a lot wrong with The Happening.

At base, The Happening is a nightmarish parable about our crowded society in modern times.  We threaten the world, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to say, with our sheer numbers.  On the other hand, being completely isolated isn't the solution either, creating a suspicious, isolationist attitude that leads to a self-destructive spiral.

But The Happening is mostly about watching people commit suicide in terrible ways.  This ranges from terrible echoes of 9/11, when workmen jump from a building to their death, to the cartoonishly absurd, when a zookeeper taunts a lion and it tears his arm off.  Anyone who watches the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet knows that big cats go for the neck first.

Anyway, The Happening's premise is spooky: what if something in the wind made people commit suicide in the most immediate and awful way possible?  Where would you go?  What would you do?

Night has all the elements of a good horror story: the aforementioned disaster, the strained relationship between Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and even an innocent little girl (Ashlyn Sanchez) thrown in for good measure.

The Happening should be a great horror film.  It's spooky.  The premise that a gust of wind could bring about a fatal, nightmarish end lends an ominous shadow to the events. We can expect plenty of drama, morally ambiguous choices, and desperate survival tactics as our protagonists flee for their lives from an alien foe.

Actually, I was just describing Spielberg's War of the Worlds, which took the same premise and made a creepy, nuanced film about parents, children, and the distance between them. The two films have a lot in common: the insidious enemy that pops up out of nowhere, the little girl in distress, the long journey against all odds to a haven that might already have been destroyed.

The Happening follows the same script but fails miserably on almost all counts. Oh, Night's got the scary part down.  But what carries a film like this is the emotional heft of characters brought to the brink.  Wahlberg does a workman-like job of trying to be clever and sarcastic, but the script forces him to spew mouthfuls of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook at a rapid fire pace that he can't keep up.  Deschanel, never a strong actress to begin with, is comedically awful.  There isn't the slightest romantic tension between her and Wahlberg.  And the little girl?  She barely says a word.

The list of what's wrong goes on and on: citizens leave New York in an orderly fashion without snarling any mass transit; victims go to inordinate and improbable lengths to kill themselves; a father abandons his only child in a vain quest to find his wife; nobody seems to think traveling with a gas mask might be a good idea except two old ladies sitting at home.

The opening shots in New York City are intended to quickly catch the audience's attention and keep it through the film. While my attention was caught for a moment, as people unexpectedly stop moving, it was soon lost by how quickly gore was added to the plot. The needle to the neck thing was not needed, I got the idea something was wrong without the gory image. Then came Mark Whalberg, an A-list Hollywood star who should know not to be a ""nice guy"" in a movie. This flick follows up The Departed and Shooter, both movies in which Whalberg is a [...] and does a great job playing a [...]. This is almost as bad as Gerard Butler following up 300 with P.S. I Love You and Nim's Island. Anyway, I am degressing, back to The Happening. The movie progresses with a nice Mark Whalberg and the occasional person jumping under a running lawn mower or getting eaten by a lion. Naturally, everyone seems to be dying in a gruesome Saw like fashion except for Mark and his on-screen family. This movie ends kind of like a Disney flick, happily ever after, well at least for Whalberg and company. That is except for whatever reason, the closing shot of the movie is a recreation of the New York City scene this time it just happens to be in Paris, why, I really don't know. The only reason this film gets two stars is because the scenery is very nice and enjoyable to look at, however it seems pretty much like all we get to see with M. Night movies is Pennsylvania. Again, at least it's pretty. If you want to see a good horror flick save your money on this. If you want gore, go see Saw, or if you want scary see The Blair Witch Project, or Paranormal Activity.

1995315,3,6300248291,"If you go into ""The Happening"" expecting an American style horror/disaster flick, you're bound to be disappointed.  What you want from that kind of film are massive explosions, car crashes, tornadoes, zombies or monsters or ghosts, and big budget special effects, all tied together into some kind of coherent narrative with escalating action, leading to a climax in which (usually) the hero saves the world (or at least the local community) and achieves some kind of much needed reconciliation with his/her family.

While there are elements of all that in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happening/dp/B001DZOC6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happening</a>, what you really get here is something else, more subtle and strange, that alternates between the utterly mundane and the overblown melodramatic, between everyday moments and terrifying extremes.  There isn't really a sense of escalating action, but more inaction punctuated with crisis situations.  For the most part the feeling is sustained by a subtly creepy intensity mixed with moments of somewhat silly, interrupted by a few sudden and inexplicable and gory moments, inventive acts of self-destruction, all designed to shock and amuse.  If you go into this expecting something else, the style here can look like incompetence.  What struck me watching it the first time in theaters and even more on subsequent viewings in the home is that this is much more like a Japanese than American style horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan effectively made a ""J-horror"" flick.  Many of the very same features that some were bugged by in this film appear in spades in ""J-Horror"" films and are accepted as cultural oddities - I think there is a greater tolerance for unconventional stylings when they appear in a foreign language.  I suspect that if this had been an Asian film with subtitles, but otherwise identical, many critics who panned it would have proclaimed it brilliantly ironic and inventive.

In J-horror (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ringu</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Water/dp/B0009KA2UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Water</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suicide-Club/dp/B0000CC885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suicide Club</a>, or, even better,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulse/dp/B000E0OE4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulse</a>) the focus tends to be on ordinary people, caught up in an inexplicable and seemingly supernatural situation, usually where some kind of force is out to avenge itself for some offence and doesn't really care who suffers, only cares that they suffer.  Part of what generates dread in these films is that the audience is aware of a real and potent threat, that the protagonists only gradually come to accept as real.  Moreover, it quickly becomes apparent there is no escape, and the threat is uncaring and implacable.  These films usually aren't plotted in the so-called ""Hollywood style,"" where a character must act to face up to an escalating challenge that is both broadly significant and deeply personal.  In J-horror, the ultimate outcome is just not up to the characters.  They can't rise to the challenge, and the escalating dread comes from the fact that their efforts eventually come to nothing.  If they end up escaping, that is as inexplicable as the initial danger; while they may resolve personal issues, the larger issue represented by the threat remains unresolved.  While the story itself often meanders and reactions often alternate between overblown and understated, what ties it together are a series of horrific images, that are not so much explicit as highly suggestive.  Anyone who's seen ""The Happening"" should recognize that it fits easily with this general pattern - Frank Darabont's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist/dp/B0010X745K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist</a>&nbsp;works along similar lines, but is closer to conventional horror film expectations.

Where the film deviates from the general framework is in its fairly unambiguous (pseudoscientific) explanations of the ultimate grounds of the inexplicable happenings.  Still, if it is blunt in its environmental message, it is also bluntly ironic about the likelihood of any changes taking place as a result of the kind of massive ecological catastrophe depicted here.  I found it to be a lot of fun to watch, and when I saw it again with my wife, we were both entertained.  My sense is that much of the disappointment about Shyamalan comes from expecting him to make the usual kind of Hollywood blockbuster films, when what he really does best is something more akin to American independent and foreign horror films.",1251244800,6,4958,6.144717800289436

1995317,2,6300248291,"From the reviews I knew the movie was going to be a letdown, but we had fun watching it and got suckered in by the spooky, melancholy sound of the wind stirring the grass and the leaves at the top of the incredibly tall trees.  From that standpoint the film's technical credits get high marks.  I even liked James Newton Howard's score, but I have a weakness for overemphatic film music--at least I thought that Howard understood the plot of the film, possibly better than MNS himself.

TIRAMISU SPOILER AHEAD!

The movie made us examine our own lives as Plato urges us to do.  We walked a mile in the other man's moccasins thinking that if a rare virus sprung up on the wind and made us try to kill ourselves, how would we do it?  It's not as easy as it sounds!  Sure, you could slide a hatpin out of your long hair and stab yourself in the throat with it, but most of us don't have that sort of hair ornament.  You saw what happened when Philadelphia comes to a standstill and an armed cop falls to the ground, his pistol clattering on the cobblestones, and a woman picks it up, then the gun falls again, well, that gun gets a lot of use, it's because people are literally starving for ways to kill themselves.  First off, I decided, I would smoke a carton of cigarettes and enjoy a pitcher of margaritas...  then see what happened.  Maybe a heroin overdose?  In the movie we marvelled how the characters managed to off themselves using just the tools at hand, like McGyvers in revsrse--I never would have thought of lying down on the lawn and letting a mower tear me to shreds....  though jumping out of a building is a natural.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, Zooey Deschanel were all uniformly terrible, and Betty Buckley brought back memories of Carrie, where she played the girls' understanding gym teacher...  does she ever survive till the end credits in any of her movies?

Most of all I thought M. Night misplayed Zooey Deschanel's secret.  We knew she was harboring a guilty secret, but why did it have to be something as banal as sharing a tiramisu dessert with ""Joey""?  Why couldn't they have had sex like most guilty lovers?  Did he died for this dessert sin?  Or is he still alive at the end of the movie?  We were all ready for the twist ending in which it would be revealed that A;ma's pregnancy was the result, not of that one dessert date, but of a long campaign to drive Mark Wahlberg mad with their deceit--so the twist ending would be, ""You told me you had dessert with him and now I found out you're having his baby!""  ""But you seemed stressed otherwise I would have told you sooner, I just made up that part about the tiramisu.""",1249862400,,2653,4.4268041237113405
1995318,1,6300248291,"This movie was a complete waste of time.  The plot is ridiculous.  I am so disappointed.  I, like the other reviewers, was a fan of earlier Shylaman films.  This was just BAD!",1249689600,,175,4.375
1995319,2,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan broke into Hollywood with Sixth Sense and was immediately considered one of the top, young directors in Hollywood.  This was soon followed by Unbreakable, a movie that cemented Bruce Willis as one of the top actors of the 1990s.  It was also a breakthrough film for the comic-book genre.  Then came Signs and the Village, two films that though still innovative and original, had many detractors.  Finally, it seems Mr. Night's magic has run out.  Lady in the Water barely broke even at the box office, and then came the outright bomb, The Happening.  Starring two familiar, but not blockbuster names, this movie adds a twist to a well-worn genre.  A plague has hit the northeastern section of the US that causes people to commit suicide.  The movie then follows a married couple's run from the plague.  Clues are dropped throughout the movie as to the source of the plague, plants.  Quite an original idea; sounds like a great premise for a great suspense, thriller, or horror movie.  This movie is none of those.  From the opening scene, the movie is quite apparent that something is up with the plants.  And of course the plants are seen swaying in the wind right before people start committing suicide - all throughout the movie.  So there goes the suspence, the foreboding, the fear of the unknown.  Even worse is the acting.  Both Ms. Daschaniel and Mr. Wahlberg look totally fake in their roles.  So all in all, a total letdown.",1249603200,,1453,4.725099601593626

The Happening is a suspenseful, spooky movie with occasional gruesome violence, unusual to date in a Shyamalan film. This 2008 movie is a thought-provoking thriller that provides hints, but no real answers to the apocalyptic crisis. The audience is left to sort through the possible causes of the cataclysmic Happening, as well as to decide what it was that ended the crisis as quickly as it began.

Was there an environmental catastrophe? Was there some earthly ecological consciousness that arose to fight off the harmful human presence that is destroying the planet? Was it a malevolent supernatural force that moved in the air, possessing and killing victims in its wake?

What stopped or slowed the phenomenon? Did it peter out as a storm dissipates? If it was some satanic force, did it just move on to another place (Paris) to possess its next victims? If the catastrophe was caused by an intelligence, ecological or supernatural, did it recognize the power of love, which halted it in its tracks?

The story focuses on the troubled relationship of a couple (Wahlberg, Deschanel) fleeing their urban life in search of anywhere safer. Both characters were played simply, pared down, but endearing and demonstrating a vulnerability and truthfulness.

I was reminded of the Biblical story of Lot and his wife, and their flight from the doomed twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Despite the couples' efforts in both stories, they failed to save the population (or fellow refugees) after repeated attempts.

I didn't find clear answers in the film, but enjoyed debating the issues afterwards. I enjoy films like this that offer more than just entertainment for a couple of hours. Shyamalan takes his place with Rod Serling (and perhaps even Carl Sagan) as a modern speculative storyteller who seeks to understand humanity and our relationship not only to each other but to the cosmos.

I enjoyed The Happening enough to purchase the BD copy. I have seen both the DVD and Blu-ray versions. The Blu-ray offers a few bonus featurettes not included on the DVD edition, as well as improved picture and nice audio quality, and a textual commentary track with occasional PiP interview material. It is regrettable that there is no commentary track from the principals or writer-director Shyamalan on either version.

Plants with brains?They know that we humans are the ones responsible for what is happening to them. I think not,they would only respond to the waste that is causing this. They would not know who is putting it there. Oh maybe it is nature,then again that would mean nature has a consciousness and can think and reason.

1995323,3,6300248291,"With The Happening, M Night Shyamalan straddles the line between B-movie (the trees are attacking!) psychological drama (there's something happening in the wind!) and a theatrical play, and how one enjoys this film will depend on how you view those nuances.  All the reviews here are accurate and they reflect one's own expectations.  You will either love, hate, or feel that this is a bland production.  Knowing that it was M. Night - a director who marches to his own beat - I had no expectations for anything big.

Trademark to M. Night's style is realism. He does not rely on wham-bam special effects to amp up the action, hence the characters are key to holding the whole story together.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, and Zooey Deschanel put in compelling, empathic performances as the people who are trapped in a situation they don't understand.

(The closest parallel to The Happening would probably be Spielberg's War of the Worlds, minus the special effects and set in a small town.)

I hadn't seen an M. Night film since the Village, but his style hasn't changed one bit.  So if you saw that, and you watched Unbreakable, well, this is in the same vein.  His characters remain mysterious and intriguing, while his story arcs need work. M. Night isn't one for a big climactic reveal either.

So, while THE HAPPENING is average as a thriller, it actually succeeds in being depressing and disturbing for a mix of reasons - there's no solution in sight and people are powerless in this lifetime to do anything.  While touching perhaps on an existential chord but not quite pressing all the right buttons, Mr Shyamalan needs to work harder at his storytelling somewhere (Robert Mckee of Story fame would attest to that).

He continues to be a quirky auteur in Hollywood genres, but many like me are how long he's going to last with his brand of moviemaking.  He continues to defy the formula, and I can't help feeling he really wants to be more distinct like Director Nicholas Roeg (""Don't Look Now"") or Canadian director Atom Egoyan.

His character driven pieces seem to suit a smaller medium like TV better, and he should really be directing episodes of the Twilight Zone if that series was ever revived.",1249084800,,2213,4.774278215223097

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;scared me more than any other movie I've ever seen because it scared me in a very psychological way. No matter how you slice it, that little boy is going to spend the rest of his life viewing gruesome deaths everywhere he goes, with no escape. And he will always be totally alone because, unless he manages to find someone who shares his sixth sense, he will never have anyone to talk to about this, nor will anyone be able to understand him. That's a lot for anyone to handle for their entire life, no matter how much you might initially be resolved to the idea of the talent as a 'gift'.

I guess what I'm saying is that I found ""The Sixth Sense"" scary because it scared me on a deeply mental level, and didn't just startle me. And I was deeply intrigued by ""The Happening"" because it seemed like the same type of 'smart horror' that would scare me in a similar manner. Unfortunately, Shyamalan seems to have decided to trade 'scary' for 'startling', because while ""The Happening"" has definite scary potential, it seems regularly eager to trade that in for cheap startles. The blood and gore are, in my mind, excessive and it's hard to escape the feeling that the blood'n'guts were added in a cynical attempt to boost sales with an 'R' rating. Pacing and suspense are almost completely thrown away from the very beginning - within a mere minutes of the movie's opening, the scientists on the telly have already nailed down that the incidents are localized around parks and other flora-heavy areas, that the infection is airborne, that it compels people to suicide, and that it probably isn't terrorist-related. This onslaught of information prevents the viewer from building up any kind of suspense regarding the incidents and all we are left with is the characters to care about.

Unfortunately, the characters are where ""The Happening"" is weakest. The acting is just horrible, really every line seems deadpan and every facial expression seems wooden and unnatural. Wahlberg in particular is intensely awful, and what was up with his opening classroom spiel? Even the creationist teachers at my private elementary schools didn't let us scribble ""Gawd did it"" on our homework and call it a day, but Wahlberg seems perfectly at peace with teaching his students that not only will they never understand nature fully, they shouldn't even try. Beyond that, there's the usual horror movie fare of ""rapid escape is essential, so let me just stop to pack some trinkets,"" not to be overshadowed by the ""I know my loved one is dead, but I have to try to find them anyway, leaving my child in the hands of childless strangers who need a new adopted kid to cement their troubled marriage"".

A lot about this movie just doesn't feel realistic, and that hurts the 'scary potential' even worse - it's hard to be scared to the point of sleeplessness when it all feels so fake. I don't mean the little stuff like the train stopping because they ""lost contact"" (how?) or the fact that houses and automobiles are generally not air-tight. I mean the big stuff, the stuff that after 9-11 or SARS, movie-makers should really be aware of. Specifically, the ending seems completely unrealistic - for months after 9-11, people in relatively minor cities were still stockpiling water and planning bomb shelters. Faced with something so much bigger, the response would be incredible. Air-tight shelters would be constructed, air masks would be worn, whole forests would be burned down by vigilante militia groups. Which isn't even delving into the fact that the responses of the people DURING the crisis seem pretty unrealistic as well - it's a plague that makes you kill yourself, so people are arming themselves with guns for protection? Gee, that seems kind of like a bad idea.

In the end, I was deeply disappointed by ""The Happening"". The movie was definitely startling, but it failed ultimately to be scary. Partly because it revealed too much too quickly, partly because the acting and characterization were awful, and partly because the movie seems all to willing to believe that movie-goers won't appreciate anything without a bucket of fake guts tossed all over the camera.

When you're actually HOPING that the main characters die, because they're so dumb and annoying and unbelieveable- that's not a good sign either.

Wallberg did not shine either but delivered a solid performance up to his own rather limited standards... but it was outright brilliant compared to Zooey, his best friend and the friends daughter!

1995331,4,6300248291,"I really enjoyed this film, but I suspect a number of viewers may not.  Like other recent Shyamalan films, it is impossible to say whether any given person reading this review will enjoy it or not.  I hope the review will help, but no guarantees.

As horror goes . . . this film will not be everyone's cup of tea (as at least one other reviewer pointed out).  Some gore, but not nearly enough for those who equate gore with horror.  There are few (if any) terrific heart thumping or 'jump-out-of-your-seat' moments.  If you must have the 'Hey-stupid-don't-go-in-there' or 'I-could-have-avoided-that' feelings to enjoy your horror, you may not like it.  If your villain must be concrete, you will be disappointed.  Finally, if constant thrills are necessary to enjoy the film, then you may well find it slow and plodding.

However, if you like subtle, really creepy horror, where the monster isn't necessarily seen (or then again, maybe it is . . . maybe we are . . .) this is probably one you'll enjoy.  In times of global warming, increased fear of terrorism, pollution, a greater recognition of the dark side of human nature, and other pressures to us and our environment, it (like other good horror movies of this nature) presents a threat from an unexpected source.

Viewed simply as a story outside of horror, this film will have varied appeal, though again, some will find it slow and perhaps underdeveloped.  If you are looking for the 'supernatural-or-fantastic-MacGuffin-driving-human-realization-and-character-growth' feeling typical of some of Shyamalan's other films, it is present, but not nearly to the extent one would find in ""Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", or ""Lady in the Water"".  This film plays more on underlying concerns, and while some growth occurs, the sense of closure found in the other three films mentioned is nowhere to be found here.

I find it difficult to know to whom to recommend different Shyamalan films, since his unique vision in each case tends to appeal to different viewpoints.  My wife's favorite Shyamalan film is ""The Village"", and I've heard several other's pick ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"".  I personally favored ""Lady in the Water"". (I realize I'm in the minority there, but that story contains aspects of all the others, and I find several of its ideas very appealing.)  With Shyamalan stories, I find one either 'gets it' or 'doesn't get it' on a personal level.  It's not a reflection of intelligence or film analytical ability, but a matter of what concerns or frightens or appeals to (generally on multiple levels) any given viewer.  The only negative (if it can be considered a negative) for this film in my viewpoint, is that I wish that Wahlberg and Leguizamo had reversed roles.  In my mind, this would have strenghthened the overall presentation, but again, it's just my opinion.  I'd be curious to see if anyone else who enjoyed this story agrees.

With all of that in mind, I'd say that ""The Happening"" represents good, subtle horror.  I find it a compelling story, and it presents a warning against human arrogance.  It is in many ways a very imaginative re-invention of Hitchcock's/Du Maurier's ""The Birds"".  I hope that others will be haunted by these aspects of it as well, though again, there are no guarantees here.",1245974400,,3282,4.945255474452555

The Happening isn't quite as bad as some people would lead you to beleive, but it's close: Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are almost criminally bad in the leads, plants are just not a cinematic enough villain (see also: The Ruins) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.

1995338,1,6300248291,"As so many other reviewers have pointed out, Shyamalan's brilliant ""Sixth Sense"" was enough incentive for me to have continued to watch his movies, even as they've gotten steadily worse. I thought ""Unbreakable"" was pretty good, really enjoyed ""Signs,"" and got some enjoyment from ""The Village."" I had a hard time believing that ""Lady in the Water"" could be as bad as the critics were saying, but yeah, it was that bad.

After paying to see that stinker, I decided to believe the reviews for ""The Happening,"" but I still hoped it would at least be somewhat enjoyable if I watched it with low expectations. As soon as the DVD was released, I ordered a copy from my local library and was disappointed to find that it was every bit as bad as I'd been warned.

I have no problem with the concept of this movie. I think if it had been handled with a little finesse, it could've been enjoyable. But: the dialog and plotting were so incredibly, amazingly awful that I watched the film with a genuine feeling of embarrassment for Shyamalan. I felt sorry for the actors who had to try to perform that clunker of a script with some kind of skill. I'm sure they were all very well paid, but if they take any pride at all in their craft, that had to hurt.

I lost a lot of respect for Shyamalan after this film. Is he really so egotistical that he couldn't stand to have someone help him with the script? I guess that question answers itself.

If you're like me, you'll probably see the movie despite the poor reviews. Do yourself a favor: reserve a copy at your local library (don't worry, no one else will have it on hold), and be sure to have something to do while the movie is playing. Perhaps you can shell some fava beans, or sort your tax receipts. You'll be glad you've done something to redeem the time you spent watching this movie.",1243987200,3,1829,4.4183976261127595

Al Gore at least makes a pretty good case for ""cleaning up our act"" here on Mother Earth. Of course there's the partisan Democrat/Republican thing getting in the way of Al's message.

The special effects of this are amazing to watch (sarcasm)!...Picture expansive shots of trees blowing in the wind. No the budget for this movie did NOT go over.

This movie about trees that go to war with humans drags on for an hour and a half. Look, I even get the fact the Shayamalan meant this to be a sort of ""B-esque"" movie. But there was no dark humor, no humor and no unintentional humor. Usually you get one of the three in a B movie.

1995341,5,6300248291,"Wow, over 115 1 star ratings for the Happening here on amazon?  I guess people didn't like the storyline, which mainly focused on a young couple running away from these poisonous plants that released a chemical making people kill themselves (in graphic ways in a few spots).

No, don't worry, it's not what you're probably thinking- you don't actually SEE the plants turn violent with silly special effects and chase after people or anything like that- it's just that, whenever the wind would blow, people had to run for their lives.  Much of the storyline focused on the outside, especially the fields, while people were walking through them and trying to find a place to hide.  The kind of people the young couple met along the way brought a lot of entertainment to the story.

And, SURPRISE, I happen to live in one of the areas where the plot was focused on, haha.  I guess I better start being nice to the plants around me then.

As I mentioned above, having plants release something that would cause people to kill themselves leaves the door open for a lot of possibilities as far as storyline direction and creativity goes, and the Happening took advantage of this BIG time with lots of incredibly shocking scenes involving suicide and people showing no concern for their own lives because the toxin from the plants was controlling them, and in a way the people on the verge of suicide moved around like zombies.

This movie did every single thing right to me- had a LOT of suspense, had a storyline that was easy to follow yet interesting enough to keep you guessing what would happen next, and the main characters were pretty good too (especially the guy).  I seriously don't get all the negativity for this movie because it was honestly good enough for me to rate it pretty highly and recommend it to others who might be interested in watching it.",1243641600,3,1857,4.654434250764526

Night takes a rather artful approach to filing somebody dieing. Of course, that rather artful scene could be the only one of the movie, as it's a stark contrast to a later scene where a man purposely feeds his arms to a group of lions. It's not bad in of itself, it just comes out like a Monty Python sketch. And this would be the story of the movie. At times it's well-done, and at times it's laughable.

Example, the marriage troubles that's the unfortunate subplot of the movie involves the wife feeling guilty, acting like she's cheated on her husband, come to find out she only had cheesecake with him. It's at this fact, that the husband feels lied to and betrayed about. To this, he responds by conjuring a story saying he was so attracted to a pharmacist, he bought cough medicine, even though he didn't have a cough. The wife is horrified at this fact, until the husband reveals he was kidding. Yes, this subplot is pretty bad, but also delightfully cheesy.

The Happening happens to be an attack of plants on humans by releasing a toxin that makes anybody affected to kill themselves via any means. Why are the plants doing this? Because we're poisoning our environment, which is the real horror in this movie. It's incredibly cheesy, and entertaining, even though it could have been carried out better in terms of plot/action. I mean, if NYC is killed by plant toxins, that's going to set the nation back quite a bit, not to mention the massive loss of life. Also, don't try to figure out the logistics of the toxin, or how it works, because you will be confused. It kills people in large groups, then kills a singular people without explanation.

Mark Wahlberg has seen better roles, however he carries possibly the film's funniest/cheesiest moment when he finds himself talking to a plant, trying to convince it that he means them no harm, and he only wishes to go to the restroom, come to find out the plant is plastic. With scenes like this, I'm even surprised he took the role. Zooey plays the wife who likes to keep her feelings inside, even though Zooey is known for being that energetic indie girl. Besides the fact that plants are makes people kill themselves, Zooey is still the highlight of the movie.

Seen as the cheesy film it is, M. Night Shyamalan's first R effort is entertaining, but the type of film you'll only want to see once. Why is it not to the par of other M. Night films? Because he's purposely trying not to be himself, which kind of hurts the movie, but helps give the film its cheese. So what is the happening?

Your enjoyment of it will hinge on how you view it.  If you're looking for something typical-- even by horror movie standards-- then look elsewhere.  If you think this cast can't act...  Well, they're doing exactly what they were told to do.  If you think Shyamalan can't direct, I think you're wrong It may not be your cup of tea, but that doesn't mean he didn't achieve exactly what he set out to achieve.

View it as a feature-length, very violent Twilight Zone episode, and you'll come away pleased.  Look for something remotely close to typical, and you'll walk away wondering what the heck you just watched.

Welllll....

FIRST ... Let me say , The Happening ... Aint Happening and if you are considering buying it DON'T !

I saw the trailer for this movie ( if you want to call it that ) and went on and purchased this DVD only to find out that that Trailer I watched WAS the most exciting clip in this ENTIRE ( I will call it footage ) not a movie or film.
What a major dissapointment this footage was...
Bad acting and I mean really just BAD/POOR acting and I mean from the supposedly stars roles to the extra's the acting was POOR!
The first 2 minutes or so was just OK and everything after that went steadily downhill.
It was Boring, did not make much sense and I go back to the acting and Directing on that ... did I mention the acting was BAD !
The subject matter as a whole is one of interest to me , However, this footage JUST did a POOR job in playing it all out.
There were about 15 times throughout my watching this that I started to grab the remote and hit the open or stop buttons to stop watching it , However, in all fairness literally forced myself to watch this entire thing, thinking maybe just maybe this will get better and it only got worse.
By the time it did go off , I sat thinking ... what a complete WASTE of my MONEY and TIME.

GeeeeZ , haven't seen anything this bad in a long time.

Now I gave this footage a 1 star and thats only because there's no way to give it a NO STAR !

.... but wait a minute ... and jest what WAS the story line ??? PLot ??? ... ha ha ha ha blowing grass n trees attacking the world ... Ohhhh GeeeeZ !

Fire the Director(s) ... Fire the Actor(s) especially the lead role guy cant think of his name but you all know who I'm talking about he was in just about EVERY scene... and if ya do that and re-work this a bit ya might have a Movie instead of Just BAD footage.",1242950400,3,1825,3.956403269754768

I won't give away the story but it's a doozy: quite possible and in fact, would probably do us good if we paid attention.

The child actress is very cute but not very good at acting, maybe she needs more experience. M. Night is a little distracted in direction, the acting seems stilted and contrived at times, so I jump out of my suspension of unbelief, but when he is on and I'm in it, it's very good. The also more food for thought than just the obvious here, something to chew on later. The horror scenes are realistic and very creepy. The camera work is nicely done, some lovely scenes.

but ultimately was nearly a
complete failure.

The violent images were well done,
but seemed gratuitous in this film.

The protagonists were two of the
most ridiculously immature characters
imaginable.
If there was a point to that,
I missed it.
Being childlike is not virtuous
for an adult.
Neither is a man being effeminate
or a woman dressing like a alley-cat hooker.
I could not embrace them as heroic,
nor experience joy at their well-being.
They only annoyed me from beginning to end.
If the scourge was in any way sentient,
I can't imagine why it would favor these
two people.

The other characters in the film were
equally lame or completely undeveloped.

I liked the apocalyptic-like story,
the mystery of what ""happened"",
but the ending is lame.

Was it a sort of chastisement of God
and/or nature? We never really find out.
The revenge of the plants?
If so, what are the plants upset about?
Was it some form of political terrorism?

I don't really know and by the end of
the film I didn't care.

All I thought of at the end of the film
is how are cry-baby and ""Lolita"" going
to deal with a seven year old child
that is more mature than they are
and how does a school bus indicate
a return to normalcy.

What ""happened"" to American cinema?

As ever, Walberg is so wooden in it, I'm surprised the plants didn't have him identified as a 5th Columnist, but he brings enough confusion and frowns to the show to not actually be too bad in this. I like the guy; he's a different kind of wooden to Keanu Reeves. It would be great to get them in the same film and have them chased by woodpeckers, termites and stuff, now that would be terrifying.

I thought Zooey Deschamel was lovely and wonderful, a definite ""keeper"" in anyone's book, a Zooey Keeper in fact. Ho ho.

Now I have got the puns out of the way, onto the film. The premise is ridiculous in the extreme, now, as a scientist, I am sure that there is much we don't know about plants, and yes, plants can produce chemicals to make them unattractive to potential predators, and yes, they can even communicate with other nearby plants of an attack to enable them to start producing the same chemical as well. This much is true. But the actual mechanism and effects themselves, it is just too silly. I am the first to recommend that in many cases, one should just put aside scientific realities for the sake of the film, but this just stretches it too far.

If perhaps the chemical induced some sort of hallucinations or random psychotic behaviours, I would have gone for it a bit more. All the dramatic music and waving of grass in the breeze was just silly in the end I thought.

Now, on to the direction. M Night Shyamalan is like a new test cricketer who started off with centuries in his first couple of matches, now; however, he is struggling to get the ball off the square. He just seems to have lost his touch and he really needs to get back to brass tacks, stop meddling too much and concentrate on getting the simple things right. There is no doubt that there are moments of tension in the film, but the overtly silliness of the plot means that you are never really fully drawn in.

Mind you, I was never really enamoured with the director after seeing that preposterous ""documentary"" about him a few years back. Please tell me no one could be as self absorbed as that, please?

And the ending, oh dear, again, lazy and contrived. Cut to the scene a few months after ""The Happening"" with the happy family walking down leafy streets full of plants. You can guarantee that if The Happening had actually Happened, there would have been a defoliation that would have made the whole Agent Orange thing look like a brisk whiff of ""Roundup"". Well, wouldn't you stamp on every blade of grass within a hundred miles if you thought the grass was going to rise up against you? Oh, just writing this made me realise the irony of the ""lawnmower incident"". Ho ho.

1995352,4,6300248291,"""The Happening"", like M. Night Shyamalan's superb ""The Village"", is yet another underrated film from a director, who has consistently produced one spectacular film after the other. I remain in the miniscule minority of people who actually liked ""Lady in the Water"", so perhaps you might want to keep that in mind before reading the rest of this review. Granted, some of his films are better than others. ""Unbreakable"", according to me, was a gigantic mis-step (though beautifully made), while ""Signs"" was a true blue masterpiece, and a classic in the science fiction genre.

Which is why ""The Happening"" remains rather elusive and abstract, when held up against his back catalog. Its certainly science-fiction, especially since he predicts a world where our botanical friends overtake the universe and start killing humans, but the real twist is that nature eventually makes man completely self-destructive - not that we aren't already - to the point of voluntary suicide. Many of these suicides appear on-screen in rather graphic fashion - people walking in front of lawn-mowers, car accidents, jumping off buildings, shooting themselves - but they all feel rather plausible given the context.

The only problem is with the casting, as Mark Wahlberg is actually a great actor who has had to 'dumb down' for a role such as this. This particular lead role requires the character to look 'continuously perplexed', and Wahlberg does so, but with a hint of irony and sarcasm, which I found rather disconcerting, especially since it seemed ill-fit in a film with rather serious undertones. Perhaps a bone-dead actor like Keanu Reeves would have done better here. I would have gone with Joaquin Phoenix, who stunned us all in ""Signs"" with his acting prowess.

The Deschanel girl, who plays the lead female character, is a fine actress otherwise (and a fine musician as well), but her relationship with the main lead feels contrived and forced. Thankfully, this relationship doesn't form the base of the story, so we are pulled into the real issue of environmental mishap and the fury of the plant kingdom. Many critics have said that the lack of a perceptible 'villain' in this film, makes the entire outing seem weak and meandering. Well, that is in part true. Every Shyamalan film has had a true 'bad guy' in some form or the other, but here, the only villain is nature itself, and thats too vague of a concept to present on screen anyway. So we are treated of trees swaying in the breeze, etc, in the hope that we'd find this vision 'menacing' (all set to some dark violin music, of course). At times, this works well, and at others, not so much.

""The Happening"" is certainly an acquired taste. Alongwith ""Unbreakable"", its the least 'developed' film in the directors cannon, but its also riveting. I personally feel that its a bit ahead of its' time because its talking about issues that people feel are silly and ridiculous, which is why many of the episodes here seem unintentionally comical. Not so. With the right spirit and with a better understanding of whats happening in the world around us, this is easily a horror flick with the best thats out there.

Certain characters, such as John Leguizamo, seem 'added on' with no actual benefit, but their presence makes sense a little down the film. Between the long 'escape sequences' and the truly harrowing scenes where the leads are trapped with a group in a field, wondering if they're going to die next, this is a superb commentary on science-fiction possibilities of the future on our planet. The climax, set in France, was especially interesting because it served as a warning of sorts.

While you might have heard absolutely loathsome comments on ""The Happening"", it really is a little classic on its' own terms. The director knew what he was doing. There is a slow, fifteen minute portion of the film where the leads are hiding out in the house of a madwoman (played to perfection by Betty Buckley), but the mood of depression, solitude and impending insanity is captured so well. Watch it just for this long segment - its truly affecting.

Four Stars. Not for everyone, but it clearly worked for me.",1241481600,,4160,4.875530410183876
1995353,1,6300248291,"We have been waiting for quite some time for Night Shyamalan's comeback with a movie that will reclaim his walk to fame.  I hate to say it, but it is starting to look as if this director's fame was purely accidental.

Set in the northeast this film is about scary epidemic that starts in urban parks that spreads to New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  People become disoriented, and before long, they start committing suicide.  No one can escape the horror.

Main characters are young married couple experiencing some marital tension caused by mutual indecision to have (or not to have) children.

1995356,3,6300248291,"I guess I can see why many film enthusiasts don't like ""The Happening"" very much.  After the rich visuals and truly ""out there"" stories of ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", and, of course ""The Sixth Sense"", this one feels a little stark and one-note, both thematically and visually.  In the former category, this is simply a story of nature rebelling against man.  Yes, there's some mystery (how far exactly will nature go?), but basically it's a movie about characters running through fields trying to escape toxin-laden winds.  On the latter front, the visuals offer no moody shadows, no scary night scenes, nothing but bright sunlight.  That's a brave and certainly credible choice in some ways (Stanley Kubrick, for example, deliberately filmed ""The Shining"" as a brightly lit movie to avoid the visual cliches of most onscreen horror), but unless other aspects of your story are rich and complex, sunshine and bright lighting probably aren't the most interesting ways to go in the suspense/horror genre.

But having said all that, the movie is still sufficiently creepy and scary, and we care enough about the characters (especially the neurotic but endearing couple played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) to stay emotionally invested in the proceedings.  It's also interesting to see Mr. Shyamalan offer up a hard R-rated film, though one can argue that his previous PG-13 limitations forced him to shock us more creatively and subtly.

In the end, if you like movies like ""The Birds"", ""The Mist"", the thousand or so entries in the ""zombies vs. mankind"" genre, or any number of other movies about a sudden scary phenomenon confronting humanity, with people having to pool together to address the crisis or just survive, you'll probably find ""The Happening"" compelling and entertaining enough. By my own rankings, it isn't nearly as ""must see"" as the Shyamalan movies mentioned at the outset, but a little more satisfying than the director's more recent efforts like ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" (though those have their merits, too).  It's a pretty good horror movie, no more and no less.

Oh, yes-- it also helps that, at pretty much exactly 90 minutes, ""The Happening"" doesn't overstay its welcome.  One can't accuse Mr. Shyamalan of believing his story is so important that it needs lots of time to fully tell.  He gets you in and out quick.

The standard DVD of ""The Happening"" features breathtaking picture and sound (it's amazing how good standard DVDs look when real effort goes into their making), and a nice selection of extra features that take you behind the scenes of the movie.",1240185600,4,2601,5.006960556844548
1995357,5,6300248291,"The sudden appearance of a never-before encountered disorder in the Northeastern United States - which moves swiftly through its stages to its final phase of causing the seemingly oblivious infected to take their own lives - launches The Happening.  The apocalypse has apparantly arrived in a most unexpected fashion, and it's jolting and eerily believable.  A small group of people tries to figure out what's going on and try and avoid the inevitable of becoming afflicted, as the menace quickly spreads from its point-of-origin and threatens to take on global proportions.

  When I first saw this one, I was under the impression that the nature of the phenomenon was going to remain a big secret until the end but that wasn't the case or the intention, and the general apparant cause of all the strange events comes out pretty quickly.  I still hesitate to give it away because it IS more effective if you go into it without too much foreknowledge the first time.  I will say that with the way the filmmakers executed it; with the citing of real-life similar phenomenon on a much smaller scale; with the drawing of attention to the fact that there's still much more about the world and the universe that humanity doesn't know than it does; and with a general projection of a sense of wonder about the mystery and grandeur of the cosmos, or nature or existance or whatever you want to call it, it makes the bizarre scenario feel real, and not far-fetched or contrived.  The interactions between the characters, including ones who are total strangers when the events begin, are powerful and engaging.  Many apocaltptic movies do well focusing on the darker aspects of people emerging in the shadow of The End, but The Happening follows a different route and focuses mostly on brighter, more benevolent instincts taking over.  There's one particularly poignant moment near the very end, which may actually involve more participants than it appears.

  All in all, a riveting, frightening, powerful movie that defies easy classification.  Highest recommendation.",1240012800,8,2061,5.005865102639296

A movie about an natural disease spread in the air that causes people to commit suicide. Mark Walberg escapes the city with his wife and the daughter of his best friend.

Wahlberg is a science teacher, Deschanel his wife, and John Leguizamo does nice work as Wahlberg's statistic spouting friend. Leguizamo gives the best performance out of everyone as a concerned dad trying to locate his wife and reunite her with their daughter. At first it seemed like kind of a fun variation on 50's B movies in which some horrible, unknown virus or disease was spreading and eccentric scientists took to the airwaves to warn concerned citizens but it's not.

Some things most people learned very early on in school..

1) Humans breath in Oxygen (O2). We breath out Carbon Dioxide (CO2).

2) Plant life ABSORBS Carbon Dioxide (CO2) through a process called ""Photosynthesis"", and releases Oxygen (O2) back into the atmosphere.

The reason the plant life ""attacks humans"" in this movie is because the human population is too concentrated - ie large population, small area.
Since it would stand to reason that a larger population of humans in a smaller area would produce a larger, more concentrated amount of carbon dioxide in the air, if only just simply breathing, plants should be significantly healthier (assuming they get proper sunlight and water).

As far as temperature of the planet is concerned - it is absolutely NORMAL, in the course of any planet's life, Earth or otherwise, for the overall ""global"" temperature to change. ""Global Warming"" and ""Global Cooling"" would occur whether we existed or not. The dinosaurs had to eat something besides each other, so obviously plant life existed long before we got here.

Others have noted the deterioration in the quality of Shyamalan's movies over the years as his ego has grown.

People start killing themselves in large cities on the East coast. At first they believe it is a toxin released by terrorists that is the cause. Later many other theories are developed, but the one about plants  releasing a toxin seems the most likely. Watch out ""Day of the Triffids"".

There's a certain amount of confusion in the script, and I sort of expected a big ""THE END?"" in the last scene, but I'm going to be generous and assume Shyamalan was doing a homage to `50s science fiction film. SIXTH SENSE was terrific but SIGNS big time; this one is somewhere inbetween.

Nomination: Worst Actor

This one's a toss up. I don't know if the nomination is for Wahlberg (who is convincing as a vulgar, angry man about town in other films) with his one-note furrowed brow and laughably insincere deliveries or for Deschanel with her perpetual watering eyes. Cry, @*#% you, just cry already! Either way you cut it, the couple's de facto adopted child gives the best performance: She says very little before deciding not to speak at all.

Nomination: Worst Screenplay

The plot is riddled with more ragged holes than Courtney Love's debauched colander. For example, a train headed out of Afflicted City mysteriously comes to a stop and deposits its frightened passengers in a small rickety town rather than completing the intended journey. Why? Because the engineer is unable to contact anybody, anywhere. That's not an answer, it's a non sequitur and that's not a plot point, it's a wet willie of an excuse. Or perhaps I'm way off the mark and the next time your engineer's radio goes out, expect to hoof it from Deliverance County back to safety.

But yowza! The snappy repartee written into these actors' mouths! (transcription courtesy of IMDB.com - except for the naughty words which I've disguised)

-Elliot Moore: [shots are heard firing in the distance] Oh no...
-Alma Moore: What ""oh no""?
-Elliot Moore: The toxin? The toxin's affecting them?
-Woman in Group: Are those people killing themselves?
-Realtor: You were with the Private, what do we do?
-Alma Moore: We need to do something!
-Elliot Moore: Just let me think...
-Alma Moore: [as shots continually fire in the background] They're dying!
-Elliot Moore: I need a second...
-Realtor: They released it? We're not near the roads!
-Alma Moore: We can't just stand here as uninvolved observers!
-Elliot Moore: I need a second okay? Just give me a second!
-Alma Moore: We're not gonna be one of those @%#holes on the news who watches a crime happen and not do something! We're not @%#holes!
-Elliot Moore: Just a second!
-Woman in Group: There were children in that group!
-Alma Moore: Elliot please tell us what to do!
-Elliot Moore: I need a second okay? Why can't anybody give me a %$#@* second?

What a bunch of @%#holes.

Nomination: Worst Director

Director is a fulltime job, Screenwriter is a fulltime job and Producer is a fulltime job. OK, some have mixed and matched these titles with marvelous results but, of course, they are the exception that proves the rule. It's just possible that ""The Happening"" has value as a cautionary tale for those who contemplate single-handedly dawning this movie-making trifecta of shame.

Granted, depicting alfalfa as mass murderer is undoubtedly a thorny dilemma, however simply fanning fields of grass in broad daylight fails to create a sense of menace. Had Shyamalan given the matter serious thought he would have realized that unseen root weevils and grasshoppers giving off irritated communal growls could plausibly represent the malevolent weeds' intent - and a Wahlberg/Deschanel duet could have easily supply the growling, whining or simpering sound effect from off screen. Lord knows they do enough of it in front of the camera.

Nomination: Worst Picture

Sometimes slowly, painfully, (cutting the skin with sharp objects) other times quickly (bullet to the brain or falling off a ten-story building).

But it hit me before the end- what the heck are the plants doing giving us an airborne drug that makes US kill ourselves? Are the plants lazy? Or are they pervertedly ""watching"" us to see what our sick little minds and surroundings will make us come up with? Or are they so guilt-ridden, but so single-minded of purpose that they're thinking, ""Oh we couldn't just release something that would cause your blood to clot, or your throats to swell up and cut off your air, or your lungs to explode, or make you vomit uncontrollably, nooooo that just wouldn't be right! So instead, we'll just spray a little something you can't see which will make you elaborately stop in your tracks, complicatedly walk backwards for a moment, and then cause you to quietly lay down in front of a lawnmower. Ta-daa! And then we can go on growing blamelessly.""

End-of-the-world scenarios have become such a cottage industry in recent years that M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that`s already begun winding down.  In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides.  The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.

As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills.  Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, ""The Happening"" ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with.  It also doesn't help that ""The Happening"" feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it (""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""Cloverfield,"" the ""28 Day"" series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny ""The Signal"" (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).

Some of his movies seem more like dreams that continue to evolve, sometimes to their darkest levels, and are played out in ""real"" life, but with a certain poetic quality.

This movie is along those lines. Is it believable? Up to a point. People are worried about the environment but could an event, so self-limiting, actually happen? To fall under the director's spell, I think viewers need to suspend their sense of reality and accept the mystery and danger of life.

In any case, I did enjoy this movie and found it evocative. 107 other people here on Amazon did not. So I dutifully note that I'm in the minority and may not be able to view Shyamalan's movies with objectivity.

A small group of people (including Wahlberg and Leguizamo) soon realize that it's a toxin coming from plants defending themselves.  However, this angle is never really fully developed.  So, from the scenes, you could infer that the plants are protesting against overpopulation, overbuilding, global warming and whatnots.

However, there are just things that do not make sense.  Plants are everywhere and everyone would be dead within minutes.  Why only in the Northeastern states?  Plants aren't isolated in that region.  When the movie is over, everything is back to normal as if there wasn't even a dent in the population.  Just unbelieveable.

In addition, there was no ""Oh, my God!"" moment as was seen in *Sixth Sense*.  In hindsight, I'm starting to believe that *Sixth Sense* was just a lucky movie for M. Night Shyamalan because all his succeeding movies (except *The Village*) aren't quite the same...in fact, they've gotten progressively worse.  So, I think it's time to stop expecting Shyamalan to pull off another jaw-dropping movie.",1233532800,2,1323,5.2727272727272725
1995384,1,6300248291,"This movie looks like something you might find in an old television series that got canceled after, say, three episodes. The script is feeble. The actors do their best, but their performances are leaden, likely because they sense the basic lameness of it all.

Mark Wahlberg stars as a high school science teacher who is caught in the middle of a strange event in ""the Northeast."" It seems that plants are emitting a toxin that causes people to kill themselves. The implication is that the plants are getting revenge for all of the pollution that humans cause. You know the plants are doing their evil deed when the wind is blowing and people start dying. And the people must be gathered in large groups for this to happen. (Or do they?)

Obviously, it's supposed to be scary. But it's just weird. Actually, one performer, Betty Buckley, does bring a sense of horror to it all. She plays Mrs. Jones, owner of an old farm that appears to be a safe haven.

But Betty Buckley's brief role is not enough to save what must be one of the worst movies ever. I can only recommend that you save your hard-earned money and go hug a tree instead of watching this.",1233360000,,1152,4.502392344497608

1995387,1,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan has brought us the '#1 thriller of all time', The Sixth Sense. He kept us on the edge of our seats during Signs, and left us stunned in The Village. However, his most recent movie release, The Happening is anything but happening.

Being a fan of the thriller/horror movie genre, I was very intrigued by the previews of this flick. People are suddenly dying and there seems to be no logical explanation. The movie's ""hero"", Mark Wahlberg, tries to find the answer and save the day as he runs from the invisible killer. This makes up the entire movie plot.

I kept waiting for it to get better. Let me rephrase that. I kept waiting for it to get good, and was disappointed. Mark Wahlberg's acting skills seem to deteriorate along with the plot as the movie progresses. Even he seems as though he's bored with the movie's story line. I have watched a lot of horror movies. I have seen the worst of the worst, and The Happening was definitely in the 'worst' pile.",1233014400,7,978,4.48876404494382

I even liked The Village, though less than the others mentioned. For Lady in the Water you can read the reviews yourself (I agree with them). Now we have ""The Happening,"" which is so unbelievably bad as to engender questions of sanity regarding all who played a part in bringing it to the big screen. The premise is actually pretty harrowing: plants go crazy, release toxins, people kill themselves. You'd think that M.N.Shymalan could really go to town with that one and bring back the scary. Nope, he decides to send us some messages instead: love is great, even with Zooey Deschanel as the least interesting heroine this side of a wooden plank; we're killing the planet, but only in the NE!; and kids are cute and innocent (but still get shot in the face in this movie). then, mercifully, it's over. the least suspenseful film and some of the worst acting I've seen since...well, possibly ever. Yes, it really is that bad. The only good thing about is is the fact that it was only 90 minutes long. I think this spells the end of the ever expanding ego that is M.

 The Pros: Like with all his movies, M.Night delivers to us a metric ton of suspense, rolled into a movie with a simple conflict. He manages to create a suspense movie that borders on horror without ever showing us a monster. The premise of the movie itself, coupled with what we see happening to the 'victims', is terrible disturbing without being graphic. It hardly showed anything at all, but several times I squealed or shouted "" WHAT THE F--K!"" to my husband, who even came out of the other room from a bid on WOW to see what had gotten his famous horror-movie loving spouse  to exclaim so. M.Night creates fantasy with little actual graphics. There is almost no special effects in this movie that you could pick out, and I LOVED that. Like all his movies, it felt rich and authentic, and I prize that in a movie maker.

The Cons: Mark Whalberg. Several times I thought he was reading dialog off screen, like he couldn't get his lines right. His acting felt shallow and un-engaging. If I were M.Night and dead set on a Whalberg, I'd of picked Donnie. At least Donnie knows how to act.

All in all, M. Night delivers again, with something that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I'll keep watching his movies. He has an incredible gift for creating fantasy.

This is by far the worst of your movies.  I mean, this movie could have easily been done by some rookie filmmaker.

I felt none of the suspense, none of the intensity, no sense of curiosity.  I couldn't even feel the tension between Deschanel and Wahlberg's character.  This was a dead, flat movie.  It was just there.  Nothing was ""happening"".

What was with all the wide shots on the people killing themselves?  No close-ups?  At least make some sharp cuts to add intensity.  There was none of that.

This whole movie smelled like monotony.  The theme music had that same dreary, moaning oboe theme to it. Even the freaking synopsis on the back cover was bland. Nothing rambunctious like ""Edge of your seat thriller"".

Wahlberg and Deschanel did a horrible job.  Leguziamo did his best to salvage whatever he could of a scene.  Not their fault.  I've seen them all do much better.  Bad script.  Bad direction.

Trees and plants as silent killers?  Okay, maybe you didn't want vines and limbs to be grabbing at people because that would have been cliche, but at least make the trees imposing enough to want to cause people to kill themselves.  Add some foreboding lighting or a weird glow.  Trees and Plants are more eco-friendly than eco-foe.  I wasn't convinced at all.  Sad.

Their weapon is a neurotoxin. Shylaman could have revealed this in a much more subtle and interesting way, revealing it slowly over time as people panic, making it a true horror piece, instead it is similar in my opinion to the ""swing away"" line plus the baseball bat hanging on the wall in Signs. Obvious to anyone with a rudimentary intelligence.  but that would be more of a criticism if it were unintentional.  He seems to want you to know, but I'm not sure why.

I happen to love mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel especially also, doesn't hurt.  There are a couple off the wall strange shylaman only sequences of course and one very funny scene where Wahlberg is talking to a tree they have discovered in a house, telling it ""we come in peace"" essentially, only to find out it is plastic.

Why? Let's see: laughable plot, juvenile acting, ""How to film a movie 101"" style cinematography and unbelievably unrealistic dialogue. Other than that, the film was great!!!
I have never been the biggest fan of this guy's work, though I have greatly respected ""The Sixth Sense"" as a masterpiece of tension, surprise, mood and downright fright. It's one of those films that is so good you want to check out everything else the director makes.
Unfortunately, the rest of Shyamalan's work has well missed the high mark he set with his first major production. Though films like Unbreakable, Signs and The Village had some bright spots, some of his other work has been downright silly and ridiculous...as shockingly evident in ""The Happening.""
This is truly filmmaking at its worst, from the goofy politically correct ""green-friendly"" plot (trees and grass ""fighting back"" against civilization and killing people?...Are you serious?) to the total lack of screen chemistry between Wahlberg and Deschanel (not to mention Deschanel's painfully bad acting and Wahlberg's ""stuck in one expression"" close-ups) to the asinine dialogue to the visually lacking camera work.
Dialogue, in my opinion, has always been a Shyamalan weakness, as I have yet to find ANYONE in the real world who uses such awkward phrases and over-dramatic statements. In this film, though, he takes this weakness to a whole new level, with absurdly constructed conversations and dramatic delivery that rivals William Shatner on Star Trek (though a cameo by Shatner could have actually HELPED this film!)
All in all, this is a true stinker that should be avoided at all costs. I just hope I can get it back to the video store in time so I don't have to pay any late fees on it (talk about insult to injury)!",1232064000,8,2062,4.9797101449275365

The story is of people mysteriously committing suicide in unique ways. What is the cause. We get to speculat and even repent for stepping on the grass.  In the end who will survive if anyone?

1995405,1,6300248291,"I want to say upfront, I'm not an M. Night Shyamalan basher. The Sixth Sense was great, Unbreakable was pretty cool too, and I even thought the Village was OK. But there is no excuse for this poorly executed disaster of a film. The film's concept itself, that plant life weary of humans polluting the planet cause us to spontaneously commit suicide, isn't such a bad one. But the way the story is told, with zero nuance, subtlety, or credibility, completely derails the plot.
Here are the main problems I see with this film:
 - bad writing: The dialog is unintentionally idiotic. For example, John Leguizamo's character relates buying train tickets to ""that cabbage patch kid craze."" Oh yeah the one that happened like 25 years ago? And we're expected to beleive that Mark Whalberg and Zooey Deschanel bonded over a mood ring, which gets trotted out no less than 3 times in the movie? Why all the stale references? I am old enough to relate to these allusions to pop culture but they distracted me from the plot (maybe that was the point).
 - speaking of plot, its trajectory stalls after about 20 minutes. People start offing themselves all over New York, then Boston, then other major North Eastern US cities. People try to escape from said cities. I can get on board with that. But when they start running around rural Pennsylvania when the trains just stop (they can't communicate with ANYONE?!), things get absurd. First we meet the middle-aged hippie couple who own a nursery and inexplicably invite some unknown survivors into their car. Then there is the high-strung military recruit who serves no purpose but to carry a gun with which infectees shoot themselves. Then a boarded up house with gun-toting yokels becomes a convenient way to dispatch the uneeded teenage companions of our heroes. But my favorite is the inexplicably raving lunatic Mrs. Jones played by Betty Buckley. She lives alone, grows her own food, and has a near-lifesize doll in a bed downstairs. After slapping the child in the group, hollering about theft and murder, her suicide via headbanging a few windows seems par for the course. It's also kind of hilarious too.
 - no subtlety at all. This is what really irked me about the film. Everything was so explicitly stated and obvious. For example, during her dinnertime ramblings, and apropos of nothing, Mrs. Jones tells the heroes about her spring house which is connected by a pipe to the main house to facilitate communication. Gee I wonder if they'll be using that in the near future? Well of course they do! Then towards the end, after the ""happening"" abruptly comes to a halt, when a character wonders aloud if this was just a warning from Nature and if this could happen again. Next scene - mon dieu! the trees in Paris attack! What about some nuance? What about leaving some things unsaid (or unfilmed) to let the audience fill in the blanks?
 - bad acting. Nobody shines in this clunker. I sort of felt bad for Mark Whalberg. I could picture him going back to his trailer after a day of shooting and just shaking his head in disbelief. He's pretty unconvincing as a gentle-soul science teacher. As for Zooey Deschanel, I honestly thought her character had a mental problem after her first scene. Her delivery and expressions just never seem to fit with what the scene calls for.
But here is what REALLY grinds my gears with this ""happening:"" people still compare Shyamalan to Alfred Hitchcock! That is just wrong. Hitchcock was a master at telling a story both through dialog and visuals. He built moods and created layers of subtlety that immersed audiences in his unique vision. Whether M. Night Shyamalan did likewise with the Sixth Sense is debatable, but he certainly has NOT done so with The Happening. His statement that this was meant to be a ""B movie"" to me is a real cop-out. The only thing The Happening has in common with any B movie is the questionable quality.",1230768000,19,3916,4.737536656891495
1995406,2,6300248291,"I would not consider myself a M. Night Shyamalan fan, however I did enjoy 'The Sixth Sense' and to a lesser degree 'Signs' and consider 'Unbreakable' to be his best so far. On first viewing 'The Village' I was lead to believe that I enjoyed it even though the twist was pretty obvious for me, but on second viewing the plot holes stick out a mile and I now have no time for it and feel somewhat ashamed of myself for being sucked in on the the first viewing! I also hold my hands up and confess to enjoying 'Lady In The Water' first because Paul Giamatti gave a very good performance and probably more so because it was M. Night Shyamalan first straight film without the obligatory tired twist that he had come to be know for. Sure it was somewhat childish in the use of the fictional creatures names but I am prepared to over look that as the film as a whole, I find enjoyable for a reason I can't quite convincingly articulate in words.

Now to The 'Happening', I'm not going to rip it apart as some have done as it is not as bad as I have been lead to believe but I'm also not going to praise it to the sky as others have. For me the biggest problem with 'The Happening' is the last 35 minutes. I was completely engaged as a viewer, intrigued with the plot and right there with the characters for the first hour as M. Night Shyamalan slowly revealed the story he wanted to tell. Unfortunately it seems to me that M. Night Shyamalan only had 50 minutes of story to tell and then hit writers block and realized that he had no idea where he was going with the story himself. The third act really has no revelations to give us to explain what has come before.

To the positives as I see them regarding 'The Happening'. The first 50 minutes has the makings of a very good film. The idea that it could be a natural occurrence to me is intriguing and I accept this as reality while watching the film. As others have pointed out, the cinematography and editing are both faultless. M. Night Shyamalan direction is for the most part very good but somewhat hit and miss regarding the main leads. There is a limited musical score throughout which I found refreshing, M. Night Shyamalan tends to use naturally occurring ambient noise to draw the viewer into the story which I always find much more effective than telegraphing every plot point with pounding music. It almost seems a lost art form now to tell a story through the film camera rather than with it as has become almost the norm now in a large percentage of films today with the camera moving every 3 seconds and shaking all over the place. On the acting front, I can not fault the large majority of the actors in their performances. Zooey Deschanel has to do little more than appear on screen for me to find her acceptable! Some of the supporting characters were weird enough to be intriguing and added to the general atmosphere of the film during the first 50 minutes.

To the negatives. Mark Wahlberg from his first line just did not feel right for me. I can't put my finger on what it is that I did not like about his performance but it just felt off. This may have been due to some of the dialogue M. Night Shyamalan provided for the character of Elliot Moore which to me seemed to be the most under written character in the whole film. Elliot Moore provided Mark Wahlberg with zero story arc over the 91 minute running time which makes me wonder if Wahlberg just signed on for the pay cheque thinking someone is going to do it so why not me? Back to the last 35 minutes, after the credits rolled at the end I was left thinking, well what really was the point of me sitting there for 91 minutes watching 'The Happening'. The last 35 minutes almost completely abandoned the nature based airborne attack on humans plot and turned into what felt like a tacked on sappy family relationship drama plot line with happy ending. What also took me right out of the film was the last 5 minutes, we skip forward 3 months and judging by the scenes in these last few minutes in particular, life seems to be completely normal as if nothing so traumatic as people killing themselves in all manner of ways ever happened and also the fact that the little girl seems to have gotten over not only the trauma of seeing first hand so much death but also the death of both her parents in less than 3 months and happily runs off to attend her first day in school.

Is M. Night Shyamalan giving me the opportunity to decide myself if it was in fact a natural occurrence or was it something more sinister. If I am to accept that it was natural, then this raises even more questions regarding the plot such as why does it only effect certain people and why does it affect some people before others. Why did it only occur in a particular area of the US and why then in France next and not somewhere connected to the US such as Canada, Mexico or the entire South American continent, well because it's more dramatic for M. Night Shyamalan to tell us that it has jumped across the Atlantic ocean with no explanation so it must be bigger than just plants right? or is it!!? What did that certain section of the population in the US do that triggered the 'The Happening' and why did it occur in the US first at all? These questions and others raised by the script as written by M. Night Shyamalan simply smells of lazy writing to me which he tries to cover up by throwing in little pieces of science from various characters now and again. Does M. Night Shyamalan expect me to fill in so many of these blanks and do his job for him. I may even go so far as to say that M. Night Shyamalan probably figured he could sell the script regardless of his lazy writing because he is M. Night Shyamalan after all.

To reviewers who have lavished this with 5 stars ratings, I am not saying that my opinion has anymore merit than others but I would ask some 5 star reviewers to review 'The Happening' as a singular motion picture and not to give it more credit than it is due based on their own interpretation of what it may or may not be about or that it is something different to the normal Hollywood blockbusters. M. Night Shyamalan had every intention I am sure of wanting this to be as big a blockbuster as 'The Sixth Sense', Unbreakable' or 'Signs' but he seems fresh out of stories he can sustain for 90 minutes now. Review what is shown on screen and not how you interpret the missing pieces. I would ask the same from 'The Happening' haters. Surely this is not as bad as 'The War Of the Worlds' remake!! The Happening does have high artistic merit which I feel was wasted in the end product.

My final reflection, worth a rent just to see why this film generated so much debate which at the end of the day it does not deserve. See it and forget it. For me a 2 star rating simply because of the lazily written last 35 minutes and the complete lack of reality regarding any sign of human physiological damage that should have been sustained by probably everyone to some degree but even more so to the two main leads and in particular the little girl. 2 stars also reflect M. Night Shyamalan for making feel like I have to write such a long review for a film that is not worth it!",1230681600,5,7198,4.3084870848708485

1995408,2,6300248291,"It's a B-movie.  No other word to describe it.  And as a non-intellectual throw-away B-movie, it's not that bad.  However it comes laden with expectation - it's a Shymalayan movie - so what's the hook, and what's the twist!
Well, the hook is that mysterious deaths start occurring in the NE of the United States.  Confusion reigns, as the news alternates between fear this is a terrorist attack, to the gradual realization this is.. well, just in case you haven't seen it yet I won't spoil the only `surprise' in the movie.  But wait, there IS another surprise - when did Mark Wahlberg become such a dismal actor!  The lines, the delivery, the timing, everything is just what you'd expect from a poorly edited 70's grindhouse movie.  Can he be doing it deliberately as an in-joke?  If so, the jokes on him because its cringe-worthy.  If you can just take it at a B-movie level, you might get some satisfaction - because there isn't anything else to enjoy in the movie.  The director has lost his flair for the gradual reveal, the careful structure, and the cinematic tools as storytelling devices.. it's a movie that is no more then the lowest denominator you might expect a movie with a plot like this to have.
The extras talk much about how this was the director's exciting foray into the world of an adult rating.  And true, some of the deaths are disconcerting, and yes, there is maybe one cheap shock to be had, but sadly it's all so straightforward, and lacks any impact, except the occasional moment of impact as you hit the wall with your head at the ineptitude.
As for the twist - there is none. It's just one of those movies that you keep thinking it will go somewhere and it goes on, and on.. then.. sort of ends.  And that's it.
Extras - deleted scenes are more of the same, gag reel is not as funny as some of the actual lines in the movie, featurettes are slight and frustratingly broken up into 5 to 10 minute chunks.  Perhaps the movie might have been better if it had the same done to it.",1230508800,3,2005,4.445355191256831
1995409,3,6300248291,"I go to see M. Knight Shyamalan movies with a grain of salt: I expect that I won't like his movies, and am usually slightly disappointed.  The Happening was a psychological thriller utilizing an older, more 'Hitchcock' variable in horror and monsters.  The true monsters here were average people, made to become their worst by pollen spawned from righteous trees, plants and grasses.  On the breezes of warm summer days, the pollen flowed throughout the world, claiming victims and working to rid the world of an over-burdening populace.  The plants and trees of the world decided to kill off the human race and, scientifically speaking, their attempt was nearly fool proof.

The movie, however, was a bit slow, and in perfect M. Knight Shyamalan-ese, it made little sense to most of those who watched it.  I got it - that's not to say I'm some genius or above the masses who hated this movie, it's just to say I got it.  I liked this movie, I was scared by it, and I left the theater thinking about it.  The full intent of the director - the more you think about the possibilities, the scarier they become.

He's not the greatest director - I liked the Sixth Sense, but I absolutely despised Unbreakable.  I like the Village, but I absolutely despised Lady in the Water.  And Signs was terrible, though it could have been so much better.

That's what I can say mostly about the Happening - it could have been better, but it wouldn't have been M. Knight Shyamalan's movie then.  He spins a very odd tale, and does not confine himself to American story telling standards.  Sometimes there simply isn't a ""good"" ending in story telling.  Sometimes the only reason for the story is to make you think.

With the Happening, the story itself was interesting; the acting however, could have been better.  Marky-Mark isn't the best actor, he's almost as wooden as Keanu Reeves, and John Leguisamo never seems to get the 'right' part in any movie he's in - I'd love to see him in a true break-out role, something that would show his real acting ability.

I seriously couldn't tell if this movie was SUPPOSED to be bad, because most of the movie is like this. The dialogue exchanges throughout the entire film are just BAD. This was, like I said, due to poor writing by M. Knight and bad acting by pretty much everyone... but it makes you wonder if M. Knight intentionally made the movie like this for ""campyness"".

Overall this movie does has some pretty frightening scenes, with the overall plot being honestly pretty good(the plants etc.).... but the writing and acting pretty much ruined it.

Then I went to a website called <thenumbers.com> to see what the box office numbers looked like for the film.  They were impressive.  THE HAPPENING's budget was $60,000,000 and its worldwide box office receipts totaled $163,000,000.  It must have been music to the ears of executives in Hollywood, who care about one thing and one thing only...money!!!

In my opinion, he's a one note wonder who hasn't anything worthwhile since THE SIXTH SENSE (a wonderful movie).  I will never see another of his films.",1230163200,4,911,4.825806451612904

Even mundane conversations during the film have that artsy feel.

M. Night's movies are really hit/miss (and most people seem to choose miss).

Great movie with the always enjoyable Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, and pretty much the movie that kicked off Haley Joel Osmet's career.

After that we had Unbreakable, which I actually enjoyed but most people were left wanting something more. Signs was next and I remember it more because of the parody in Scary Movie 3 than for the real movie itself - in fact for a long time I thought Simon Rex was in the real movie instead of Joaquin Phoenix. Alas...

I liked The Village - mostly because Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) was awesome. I loved the plot twist, and I loved the tension I felt watching it. Very effective, although many people say it was predictable right from the beginning. Lady in the Water came next, and I just didn't get it. I was waiting for the twist that never happened, and the storytelling was too slow.

So then we're given The Happening. What a piece of junk (did I mention this already?). It was painful to watch Zooey Deschanel try to act. I am totally in love with her sister who is the star of Bones, but come on...Zooey doesn't need to follow in the family path. She was painful to watch in The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and even more so in The Happening. You could almost tell that Marky Mark was struggling to work with her. He really wanted to be believable, but frankly someone needed to direct him.

Plot points were crap, writing was crap, dialogue and acting was crap. We got to the end of it and we could barely function.

""Did we really just watch that?"" and ""What the h*ll was that?"" were repeated phrases in our living room. What a ridiculous mess. There was so much potential here of people suddenly killing themselves in various odd ways, but when we find out that it's because of the plants, it's like...why? Why are we watching this? Is this why they advertised it as an R-Rated movie, because if that's all it's got going for it...

It makes no sense - the plants kill us when we are in groups so we split up into smaller groups, but they still kill us when we're in smaller groups? WTF? What's the motivation of the plants? (it's a consistent concern about Night's movies that the characters seem to lack motivation for much of what they do - now we have a character of plants, and they have no motivation whatsoever).

Difficult to watch from start to finish, but I wanted to get through it and give a thought out review, but having waded through the muck, I find that there is really little positive I can say.",1229904000,6,3102,4.627272727272727

1995417,2,6300248291,"""The Happening"" didn't.  M. Night Shyamalan's film rested on a strange premise.  While I liked the environmental message echoed in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" that man must be a partner with nature on the planet, the idea that a substance could abrogate free will and drive masses to suicide seemed preposterous.  If the plants had decided to go on an oxygen strike and people started suffocating, that might have made more sense.  Here we have wind blowing on the grass or the wind in a tree which is supposed to be a sinister event.  Shyamalan's image of people jumping from buildings was unique as was the car crash.  However, these moments could not salvage a weak premise.

The shaky premise was also complicated by the lack of acting performance.  This has to be a failure of Shyamalan as a director to elicit good work from most of his actors.  I did like two performances in the film.  Betty Buckley was the coach in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/0792839676/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>&nbsp;in her first film back in 1976 & played a country singer in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tender-Mercies/dp/B00005R246/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tender Mercies</a>.  She won a Tony award for ""Cats.""  As Mrs. Jones, she creates one of the creepiest characters I've seen in a long time, a woman who lives in the middle of nowhere, cut off from contact with the outside world with no telephone, television, radio or computer.  When she smashes her head through the glass, it is the crowning moment to a woman who slapped the girl's hand for reaching for a cookie and screamed with paranoia that her guests were trying to steal from her shabby old house.

Another good cameo was by soap star Kristen Connolly who played a confused woman reading on a bench.  Her confusion and odd behavior sets the tone for upcoming events.  Child actress Ashlyn Sanchez as Jess did an acceptable job with the little she was asked to do.  Her stoic stare as her father abandons her has to be Shyamalan's choice.  Alan Ruck who was in the great film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twister/dp/B00004RFFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twister</a>&nbsp;as well as ""Speed"" has a brief cameo as the principal.

On the negative side, Colombian-born actor John Leguizamo was in a film I liked,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-on-Precinct-13-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0007W7I4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault on Precinct 13 (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Groomsmen/dp/B000HRMAVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Groomsmen</a>&nbsp;now joins this film as two for which I did not care.  As the father Julian, I understand his concern over the fate of his wife.  However, his abandonment of his daughter in a stressful uncertain time was inexcusable.  And this was BEFORE he went nuts.  Leguizamo did what he was asked to do; so again the fault in conception is with the director.  Mark Wahlberg's cardboard thin performance as science teacher Elliot Moore may have one wondering if this was the same actor nominated for an Oscar for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M341QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  In the scene where he's separated from his wife, his level of concern was very low.

For me the worst performance of the film, the real raspberry, is Zooey Deschanel as Alma.  This actress had received a Best Actress nomination by the Independent Spirit Awards for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-Real-Girls/dp/B00009ZPTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the Real Girls</a>&nbsp;and was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Assassination-of-Jesse-James-by-the-Coward-Robert-Ford/dp/B0010DR4BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>.  I have no idea what Shyamalan said to her to get such a wide-eyed vacant stare as a woman who thinks she may have destroyed her marriage and faces the lethal health crisis that threatens her life.

1995418,2,6300248291,"This movie could have been so much better than it was. The concept was great, and the beginning of the movie is very creepy.

Here's the flaws though:

1. Besides John Leguizamo, the acting is absolutely awful. Zooey Deschanel is a horrible actress and makes any attempt at a love subplot impossible to believe or connect to. Whenever there was a scene that I could tell was supposed to make me think ""aw, that's nice, good for them!"" I ended up just thinking ""who cares?""

2. A ""guess"" by a random farmer turns out to be the actual reason the ""happening"" is even happening. You would think all of the guesses early on in the movie would be plausible and then the REAL reason would turn out to be mind-blowing. This was not the case though, and it was very disappointing to have the mystery solved so early and so easily.

3. The reason for the ""happening"" is (I won't spoil it, although I'm using that word loosely) simply cheesy. A part of me was thinking ""well, at least he took a risk and gave us a good message"" but the other part of me couldn't help but overpower that with ""that was just too cheesy for me."" It reminded me of Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster - great message, but just too ridiculous to really connect with anyone.

4. M. Night Shyamalan is a great filmmaker. That may sound like a positive, but when you're expecting a great film from a great filmmaker, anything less is disappointing. I thought The Lady in the Water was a bit cheesy, but excused it since it's supposed to be ""a bedtime story"". This movie just has no excuse though, and I really hope he thinks long and hard about his next move. Any more flops like this one and he'll become a joke.

The movie is worth seeing if only for the eerie scenes that actually work, and the excellent film score. Just don't expect it to change your life, because it certainly won't.",1229558400,,1847,4.385964912280702

His movies always have a bit of a surprise in them as well, where here, we follow the plot to its conclusion.

It's kind of convenient when a movie is written, directed, and produced by one person.  This way, you definitely know where the blame lies.  In the case of ""The Happening"", we can place the blame squarely with none other than esteemed director M. Night Shyamalan.  It amazes me that this work could come from a guy who directed ""The Sixth Sense"". The only real value in this film is that it is so bad, it is amusing.

I gave this movie one star because I did enjoy the opening.  Something strange is happening in Central Park.  People are frozen in their steps.  One young woman stabs herself in the neck with a hairpin.  A few blocks away, a construction worker falls to his death.  This was bad enough, but then the site started raining bodies from the scaffolds.  We learn that this behavior is caused by some sort of neurotoxin in the air.  This neurotoxin shuts off the brain's ability for self-preservation.  Was the neurotoxin released by terrorists?  Is it some sort of government experiment gone bad?  Or is it, perhaps.....the Trees?!

The acting was uniformly poor in this film, starting with ""Markie Mark"" Wahlberg in the lead as Elliot.  In this blatant case of miscasting, Wahlberg plays a science teacher.  Not even close.  He got no help from Zooey Deschanel as wife Alma.  Her utility in this film was limited to semi-closeups of her admittedly beautiful blue eyes.  I have never seen an actress less engaged than Deschanel.  While this pandemic was unfolding around her, Ms. Deschanel seemed limited to two or three facial expressions.  Wahlberg and Deschanel had zero chemistry.  John Leguizamo took the role of Julian, the math teacher friend of Elliot.  Luckily for him, he got to commit suicide halfway through. Part of the blame can be assigned to the actors, but the script was so poor that you hate to judge them.

One important part of any film or play is pace.  This one moved like a glacier.  You could literally drive a truck through the dialogue cues.  This is director error, plain and simple.

There was some nice camera work and special effects.  There is some cool, haunting music.  Other than that, there's not much more positive to say about this film.",1229212800,4,2211,4.721784776902887
1995425,1,6300248291,"I'm a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKBLE, and SIGNS are not only entertaining films, but the stories in those films tacks some very deep and important issues, such as love, the nature of evil, and faith.  Even though THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER were not as well received by either audiences are critics, I enjoyed both of them (in fact I loved LADY IN THE WATER--it's a modern-day fairy tale told right).  Therefore, I was quite excited to see THE HAPPENING.  Instead of having some great philosophical discussions with friends and family after seeing the movie (as happened each time before after I saw Shyamalan's films), I left thinking ""What happened?"" and ""That was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.

The film begins interesting enough and contains enough shock value to hold one's attention for the first half of the film.  It's just another day in Central Park in NYC.  A woman sits on a bench chatting with a friend when she hears someone scream.  A breeze flows through the park and then everyone stops moving.  Moments later the woman's friend removes a hair pick and begins stabbing herself in the neck in a deliberate act of suicide.  Minutes later at a downtown construction site in the city, a foreman is trying to contact a worker who won't respond when the missing worker's body plunges from the sky.  The event is witnessed by several people, but as they rush to the fallen man's aid other bodies begin falling from the sky as worker after worker walks across platforms and plummet to their deaths.

The story then moves from NYC to a small, rural Pennsylvania high school where a high school science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is giving an engaging lecture to his students early in the morning. At this point in the movie, as Mr. Moore pontificated about science, I was reminded of a sci-fi parody I saw a few years ago, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA.  The hero of that movie was a scientist, too and said some of the same phrases (almost word for word) that Mr. Moore spoke.  Of course, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was a parody film of all of those cheap sci-fi pictures of the 1950s and 1960s and was illustrating at how absurd it was that just because a person was a scientist they could be a credible hero and save the world from its problems.  When a movie that begins so shocking, interesting, and thrilling takes a sudden detour and causes one to remember a hilarious sci-fi parody about ten minutes into the movie, it's not a good sign.

As for the rest of the plot, Moore is pulled away from his class by his principal who informs them they are dismissing school for the rest of the day and is told about what has happened in NYC.  Most of the country assumes that what has happened (and continues to happen as the movie progresses) is a biochemical attack begun by terrorists.  Moore isn't convinced and as people begin to migrate to smaller towns to escape the ""fallout"" of whatever weapon was used, it becomes apparent that even small town America isn't safe.  What happened in New York starts happening across the entire U.S. Northeast.  Moore flees with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) as the try to escape the rather large effected area and reach civilization.

I really like Zooey Deschanel. I think she's beautiful and is rather talented given decent material. It was almost painful to watch her in THE HAPPENING.  Her lines were terrible, her character had absolutely no personality, and she had zero chemistry with co-star Mark Whalberg.  I'm not a huge fan of Whalberg. He got a huge break early in his acting career because of his huge music stardom and some of the roles he has played he delivered a performance more wooden than a Pinocchio statue.  Still, Whalberg does have some talented and, like Deschanel, when given decent material, e.g. THE DEPARTED and INVINCIBLE, he excels.  THE HAPPENING isn't a movie where he's allowed to display his talents as a performer.  Instead he spends most of the time running around with a scared look on his face and saying lines that even a high-school dropout who hates reading can recognize as bad writing.  Oh, and did I mention he has no chemistry whatsoever with his co-star who is playing his wife, Zooey Deschanel.  Whalberg does a better job of trying to make the best of bad dialogue, but most of the other actors in the movie don't even try.  It's a bad script and other than a few scenes scattered throughout the movie, most of the cast doesn't even seem to be trying.

Other than the terrible writing, there's a thing called plot that if very, very weak.  Bascially (SPOILERS AHEAD) the Earth's plants have decided to murder us.  That's it. The plants are the bad guys.  That's right. Plants. Enough said about that.

Shyamalan's films have always had a layered subtext that seems more important to him than even the actual films themselves.  His films are full of meaning and are richly rewarding if viewers allow themselves to think about what they are seeing.  I'm sure there is some sort of subtext in THE HAPPENING besides the surface story about nature turning against man because of the destruction we've caused through things like man-made global warming.  The problem is that it's not really decipherable what that message is.  Is the movie really a comment about terror attacks and how paranoid the citizenry becomes in such events? Is it about the fickleness of the masses?  Is it about how reliant we've become upon media and technology so much so that we can no longer think for ourselves?  Or is it more like the surface story, a cautionary tale in the vein of JURASSIC PARK warning us that no matter how scientifically advanced we might think we are, nature will always find a way to outsmart us?  The movie might be trying to make all of these points, but none of it really matters.  In the past, the messages made sense because the movies that Shyamalan made were actually enjoyable to watch.  Even THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER are good movies if you watch them with a child-like wonder and accept them for what they are.  However, no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to help make THE HAPPENING a good movie.  Whatever message or messages Shyamalan was trying to make become lost and completely overshadowed because the vehicle the message is being delivered in (the movie itself) is so terribly bad.  The only good points are the shocking opening sequence and a few other well-done scenes scattered throughout the movie. And that's all that's happening with THE HAPPENING.",1229126400,4,6625,4.696969696969697

A terrorist attach is ruled out, and eventually its discovered that the country's plants are fighting back against humans with some unseen chemical riding on the wind.

Shyamalan really had a unique knack for directing fear in his actors at his most inspired moments, and in addition to that the writing of his first two films was also a plus.  He was a very good filmmaker for a spell.  The Happening is so much more tragic than some people have warned, but here at Amazon it seems I finally find myself agreeing with many other reviewers who I'd normally suggest are exaggerating.  One says ""so bad it's shocking"" and another calls the film ""the crappening"".  Both are spot on.

Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher whose marriage to his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) is seemingly in some jeopardy.  His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) is aware that Alma may have been unfaithful.  Along with Julian's daughter, this group searches for safety in a world that has just been hit by a massive suicide epidemic that is never convincingly explained and never turns out to be an engaging occurrence to begin with.  I actually like all three actors in some roles but they are either left with so little direction that they don't know what to do or how to react to Shyamalan's apocalypse, or they are smiling behind thin performances because they realize they are in a bombastic failure of a film.  I lean toward the latter because by the film's conclusion Deschanel and Wahlberg really seem like they are in a comedy.

The Happening is bad because it wants to be taken so seriously.  It has moments that should be horrifying but instead elicited several moments of laughter from this viewer.  For those who have seen the film I will just say that the scene that really sticks out for me involves a suicide at the zoo.  There are also moments of incredibly unlikely behavior; to the point where I slapped my own forehead.  I mean come on, if a lady is talking to her daughter who is vulnerable to this unknown suicide causing agent, I hardly think she would put the girl on speaker so a dozen other people can hear her die.  It's a shame because The Happening should've been good.  On the surface it is a decent story with a good cast.  Not to mention all of the pieces theoretically enhance Shyamalan's talents.  I was hoping this would take films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JU7KAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>&nbsp;and promptly decrease their significance in the mainstream eye, but instead The Happening only serves to support Shyamalan's very obvious decline.",1228780800,4,3181,5.8441558441558445
1995432,1,6300248291,"I'm no M. Night Hater.

In fact, I love his earlier movies. There was a time when I believed he was the next Hitchcock or Rod Serling.  The man knows how to make suspenseful movies with well-drawn characters. But something... er, ""Happened"" along the way.

What I like about his better movies is the way he reduces a genre to its basic elements.  Ghost story, comic book hero story, alien invasion: they are all told through the eyes of believable, everyday people. No splashy effects, just tight, deliberate story-telling.  And who could ask for a better composer than James Newton Howard?

But while I love some of Night's movies very much, I've found myself dissatisfied with his later attempts. I disliked the ending of ""The Village,"" and I was underwhelmed by the overall banality of ""Lady In the Water,"" but neither of those movies compare to the professional suicide (pun intended) Shyamalan commits in ""The Happening.""

I think M. Night's intent can be best illustrated by a billboard that appears in the movie while the characters are wandering lost in the countryside (and the plot). It reads: ""You DESERVE this!""  Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I couldn't help but think M. Night was subjecting his audience to this campy, poorly written piece of B-movie garbage on purpose.  It's not like it's the first time he has written with a grudge (see the character of the movie critic in ""Lady In the Water,"" for example).

If you are expecting a movie up to the standards Shyamalan established with ""The 6th Sense"" or ""Signs,"" you're in for a huge disappointment. If, however, you hate his movies and/or just want to howl with laughter at this unintentionally (or maybe intentionally) funny failure, ""The Happening"" could be your favorite movie of the year.",1228694400,6,1766,4.8566666666666665

He still seems capable of coming up with original and interesting ideas for a story (at least for the first 15 to 30 minutes of the film), but as they develop Mr. Shymalan now seems incapable of bringing them to the one-of-a-kind clever ending, as he did in The Sixth Sense, instead, he is getting worst: Mother Nature taking revenge against human kind for its evils against her?. Come on, this is not only a bad ending but also a cheap environmental message. The public does not deserve to endure until the end for such ridiculous explanation.

There are at least two literary pieces from the Nobel-laureate Portuguese novelist Jos&eacute; Saramago that follow a similar storyline, ""As Intermitncias da Morte"" (English:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-with-Interruptions/dp/0151012741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death with Interruptions</a>) and ""Ensaio sobre a cegueira"" (English:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blindness-Movie-Tie-In/dp/0156035588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blindness (Movie Tie-In)</a>) and yes this is the one that gave inspiration for the script of the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blindness/dp/B001LLH8SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blindness</a>. In the former, suddenly nobody dies within the borders of a country, and in the latter, everybody begins to get blind without a logical explanation. Regardless of the Saramago's fantastic or supernatural explanation for such weird events, the real value of both stories resides in how the writer shows you the real nature of human beings, naked with all of our defects, fears and weaknesses. Just for that, both books are worth the reading. But in The Happening no such a message is present, so you endure for 90 minutes waiting for a clever explanation in vain. Add weak performances and excessively gross and shocking scenes, there nothing left.

It seems Mr. Shymalan is after all just one of those artists with only one extraordinary piece of work, and the more he keeps trying, the worst he performs. Do not waste your time and money buying this film.",1228521600,5,2483,6.544072948328267

I found the Village to be somewhat disappointing,with a strong beginning but a weak finish, though it was still watchable and reasonably entertaining. But then there was the Lady in the Water.

While the ""threat"" or ""main issue"" of the movie is often dramatic and horrifying, the dialogue and relationships of the characters are usually delicate and graceful.  There's a beautiful subtly to his movies that tug at your heart ever so gently.  All of his main characters have wounded souls that, somehow through the difficulty they confront in the course of the story, figure out their greatest strengths.  Not every ending is a perfect one and not every loose end is neatly tied and I wonder if that's why so many are walking away from his movies disappointed.  There's no bang-bang shoot em' up or excessive gratuitous sex in every scene.  I really walk away feeling connected to the people in his films.  They seem like everyday people (with the exception of a few supernatural powers in some of his films - lol) with everyday internal struggles and I like that.

The Happening's characters are really no different than any of Mr. Shyamalan's other films, but the story is definitely different.  No one ever fully answers the question of what is happening, yet there is a perfectly scientific plausibility to the event.  I felt a myriad of emotions from fear and panic to being intrigued with how the story unfolded and ultimately how it ended.

For a viewing population perhaps desensitized over the years by the plethora of schock garbage full of exceptional blood and violence, M Knight doesn't seem to understand that at base, ""The Happening"" remains rather tame in that respect.

The first ten minutes are really good actually and I had high hopes for the film. But after that it just goes downhill. Firstly its completely miscast. The lead woman, Zooey, was a complete non-entity with no screen presence whatsoever. Mark Wahlberg, whilst quite easy on the eye just isn't a very strong actor. John Lequizamo was wasted in it due to terrible dialogue. Which brings me to the second main point - its badly written. Very badly written.

We've all come to expect some sort of twist at the end of Shyalaman's films but this had nothing. The plot wasn't explained at all and we are given no idea why whats happened has happened.

The rest...awful!

  Bad bad bad writing:  Some of the actors/actresses in this movie aren't bad...like Zooey...but they're stuck with the work of very bad writers.  Lots of dumb lines in this movie.
  The strained relationship between this couple could have been developed better as well as the relationship between the husband and his friend.
  The strange lady of the house towards the end of the movie (she played the step-mother in ""Eight is Enough"") wasn't developed well.  If she was that paranoid about people she wouldn't have let the couple and the child in the house for a meal in the first place.
  The plot was...IMO...dumb.  If this were a terrorist (or even an alien) plot and the major characters had the responsiblity of tracing down the culprits and stopping them then maybe this would have worked.  Instead it's some sort of vague happening with plants that some scientist gives a theory about towards the end of the movie.  No real resolution at the end.

1995465,2,6300248291,"I rented this based on the photo on the cover: the rows of cars and everything abandoned.

The movie did keep my interest: some sort of unusual natural event causing people to hallucinate and kill. For the most part, I wanted there to be more to it. I never did fully understand what the big deal was about the 'smaller groups being safer' idea. I am really glad that aliens didn't have something to do with what was taking place.

Zooey Deschanel's character was annoying and her look/eyes were unnatural and freaky in the beginning; Wahlberg was okay. How about when those folks in that house stuck there guns out the window and shot the kids who were trying to get in. The people didn't want to open the door or have anything in the wind coming in...so, if they were so afraid, why would they even point there guns out the window? And the scene where the dude was just there letting the animal rip his arms off and he had no reaction of pain...puh-leez.

At the end, when the man & woman left their buildings, risking death just to be with each other, I paused the scene and thought of how it might end:

The problem was stated to begin in parks. Philadelphia; New York; big areas. I began to think that the plants in those areas were reacting to all of the violence nearby; like, they could feel 'energy' in those high-crime locations. That the plants evolved to 'realize' that we were a threat because of our violence towards each other.

Now, the man and the woman really seemed to love each other and I was thinking that nature would 'feel' that they were safe around those two and wouldn't harm them. Love had saved them; love/kindness can save us.

I figured that the mood ring that the man was wearing would have something to do with it; that they'd show it and it would be the color for love (whatever that would be). It would have made more sense to me if that was an ending. That would make the 'safer in smaller groups' idea sensible, too; less people...less chance of differences/anger?

Instead, we learn later that, a minute before they went outside, the phenomenon just stopped for some reason. It was just something that happened in nature that we can't explain. In the end, you were supposed to think from this movie that we need to treat mother-earth better [there's garbage; pollution in the air; destruction of trees; and so on).

Mark Wahlberg; I've loved him in many films, but this wasn't the right role for him.  I didn't buy him as a school teacher, and didn't buy his Mr. Innocent, kind-hearted persona.  He's gotta stick to being hard core and intense.  He's a very one-dimensional actor, and this role was beyond his capabilities, in my opinion.

After the first 15 minutes of this film, it goes downhill and never gets better.  This is one of the non-scariest horror movies I've seen...the real horror is that one of Hollywood's best young director's is in a funk. I caught 'The Ring' and the 'Final Destination' trilogy on tv recently and they were much more intense and creepy than this burnt offering. (Honestly, I think I was more entertained by M. Night's 30-second American Express commercial a few years ago.)

The eco-horror themed story was lackluster--even laughable at times, and the lead acting from Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel so flat that I've seen much better in a made-for-sci fi channel '100 Million BC' dinosaur movie starring Christopher Atkins.  Wahlberg was much better in the underrated action flick 'Sniper', and Deschanel's doe-eyed charm was great in 'Elf', but here she channels something akin to pizza cardboard meets Deborah Winger.

If you want a real good bio-organic scary movie thriller, rent the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or the remakes of that movie starring Donald Sutherland or Nicole Kidman.

And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were ""happening.""

Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of ""The Unhappening"").

Let's see ...where to begin...

I guess the story is as bad a place as any...

First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit of a caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's ""chasing them.""

Second problem...

Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Departed/dp/B000M5AJQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Departed</a>), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Age/dp/B000MGB6LO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Age</a>) and Zooey Deschanel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Failure-to-Launch/dp/B000K7UG3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Failure to Launch</a>), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries (""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!"") and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.

The final stone...

I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M. Night has been able to deliver it.

But here, it just ain't ""happening.""",1225584000,,2881,5.90625

This movie was a sad waste of the talents of John Leguizamo and Mark Walhberg. I don't know how Zooey Deschanel keeps getting work. I haven't liked a thing she's been in, and putting those two together as husband and wife made no sense at all. They had zero chemistry together.

The first 45 minutes of this movie are truly creepy.  From there, I was ready to call this one of the better Horror/Suspense movies I've seen in a very long time.  Then, Night dropped the ball and completely blew it in the last act.

My theory is that Signs and The Sixth Sense were good because he didn't have the arrogance (or the power) to take credit and control literally and nominally for the whole project.  He used to collaborate with talented people and was able to optimize the product based on his personal skill set.  Now The Happening is just a real-life nightmare of film-making that we're all going to have to live with (hopefully as many of us will be able to steer clear of it as possible).

Now would be a good time to mention that my nephew also writes, produces, and directs his own films and is putting out stuff of about the same quality as The Happening.

1995485,1,6300248291,"This movie should be missed.

A sad comment to have to make regarding a normally more skilled director.

This was meant to be a serious, paranoid horror/sci-fi film. But, in this film, the acting and the script are shockingly bad...the lines of the film and the performances have this odd, UNINTENTIONAL slapstick/goofball style to them that glaringly doesnt fit. I am not sure what Shamalayan was going for with that, but it very much did NOT work. The silliness of the way the characters act in various scenes is in direct contrast to the supposed nationwide terror the characters are supposedly fleeing from. Awkward scenes and attempts at humour here and there aren't funny, just awkward, because the entire script is so bad it's hard to tell what's an intentional joke and what isnt.

For the high budget, interesting concept, and excellent cinematography this movie has, the acting from leads Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel is really bad and uninterested...(only John Leguizamo escapes relatively well in this film, he does the most decent job in the movie, even though he is only in it for a short time)

And the other smaller roles in the film (especially the soldier that runs up, says some stuff, and then yells ""Cheese and Crackers!"")....Awful!!  The actors themselves seemed to hate the film, and this DOES come across in watching it, no matter how hard they try to play their roles)-especially true for Zooey Deschanel...Wahlberg seems perplexed in how to do this movie, he tries hard, but Deschanel does very little.

Shymalayan's films do not rely on special effects and CGI monsters to display the horror of situations. His earlier films were famous for having more IMPLIED horror than shown horror. For that reason, his films have leaned heavily on the ACTORS to imply the correct tone for the film, and to show the EFFECTS of the horror through acting skills. Sixth Sense and Signs were very good examples of this. But, when the acting and script itself falls flat in a Shamalayan film, there's nothing else to run the film, and the movie, sadly, collapses.

Ultimately, this is a study in seeing a great director crash and burn with a film. Seeing that this was written, produced, and directed by Shyamalan, the buck stops there. He always insists on complete creative control in his movies, and, sadly, when they crash and burn as bad as this one, he takes the blame.

This movie ranks down there with ""Boogeyman"" as one of the worst ""horror/sci fi"" films of the last 5 years. I strongly hope Shamalayan can come back, but he needs to take a break for a couple of years and get his bearings again. This film was, sadly, an epic failure.

Sorry...It isn't worth buying on DVD.
I rented it...for FREE...and I still don't want to ever see it again.

It's not a message movie any more than ""The Birds"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (two classic horror movies that were an obvious influence) were message films. The global warming ""message"" which critics and M. Night haters claimed was so hackneyed is nothing more than a plot point, a means of creating the situation that the characters find themselves in. The acting is not always convincing; there are a few awkwardly over-acted scenes during the slow moments, but for the most part it is perfectly adequate and, at it's creepiest moments, spot-on scary. The dialogue is a lot more tongue-in-cheek than most people give it credit for, and I found myself laughing quite a bit. That was an intentional attempt at lightening the mood. After all, it's otherwise extremely dark, with very disturbing violence. It is not a subtle film, but who ever claimed that a horror movie had to be subtle to be good?
I think people have come to expect a very specific thing from M. Night's films. If they get what they expected, they complain about how obvious it was (""The Village""), and if they get something unexpected (this film) they judge it on the same criteria as his previous films. Forget about how much you loved ""The Sixth Sense"" or hated ""Lady In The Water"". Watch this one without any M. Night-preconceptions, and expect nothing more than a very clever and very creepy variation on the zombie/apocalypse horror subgenre, and I think you will be very pleased.",1225065600,,1531,4.7593984962406015

Things morph into a series of bad acting performances, stupid scientific speculation, and ends up awkwardly unresolved.

I seriously consider if lead actress Zooey Deschanel wasn't under the influence of some mind altering substance during this filming. (And maybe she began sharing it with the director??).  It is so obvious that I thought her behavior might be part of the story, but, nah . . . it was just BAD ACTING.  I could have done better,  And I'm not an actor.  I'm not even a female.  And Mark Walhberg is better than this.  He must have been in agony when he viewed the screening.

I even enjoyed SIGNS and THE VILLAGE (though to a lesser degree), but LADY IN THE WATER was a huge disappointment.  So, I was really looking forward to the release of THE HAPPENING to see if Shyamalan had gotten his stuff back together.

Silly me.

In the film's storyline, a bizarre neurotoxin has been released on the northeastern United States--the effect of which is to make its victims suicidal--and both the government and the scientific community are baffled as to its origin.  In one of the movie's more ""Shyamalan-esque"" moments, the explanation actually is anticipated very early in the film by a high school student in science class.

The secret of who (or what) is releasing the neurotoxin is hinted at very strongly in the movie's opening moments:  Humans are the only creature targeted by it, while people's pets remain totally unaffected. (That wasn't really a spoiler, because the vagaries of mother nature's moods, as well as plant life's supposed ability to ""target"" specific threats to its safety, are themes which receive broad airplay throughout the film.)

For the most part, both tension and surprise are sorely lacking in the film, although there are some interesting characters (including a really creepy old woman) which add a bit of spice to an otherwise dull recipe.  THE HAPPENING even lacks Shyamalan's trademark ""gotcha!"" moment at the end of the movie.  The conclusion is predictable and formulaic, and you can see it coming a mile away.

Right then, I knew M. Knight was going to lead us nowhere. It was going to be a pointless, adventure-less, creative-less exercise in tediousness. What do you know? I was right.

After crafting smashing flicks like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, it seemed as Shyamalan couldn't do wrong.  Then we had The Village and Lady in the Water; end of story.  Maybe that's why I looked so forward to The Happening, as it seemed as if Shyamalan may have re-discovered what made his films so good in the first place.  Heavily marketed as being his first R-rated film, The Happening is instead mammothly disappointing as a horror film or paranoid thriller, and for it's relatively brisk running time, just seems to meander along.  Mark Wahlberg stars as a science teacher in a failing marriage who, along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher (John Leguizamo) go on the run when a toxin hits the air, causing people to kill themselves.  While The Happening gets off to a great start with some wonderfully creepy and graphic moments, it loses its momentum as the story drags on.  It doesn't help that Wahlberg and Deschanel are miscast either, and in the end we just don't care about the characters at all.  Still though, Shyamalan manages to inject enough disturbing imagery into the film to be able to get under your skin, and suggests that maybe he's looking to get into an edgier kind of film making instead of the tried and true ""PG-13 with a twist at the end"" kind of deal.

During the course of the 90 minutes the film runs, you find yourself becoming more and more disappointed and confused.  Confused because you cannot believe what you're seeing on your screen is from the same mind that brought you those previous films.  Confused because the acting is all so overdone and over-dramatic, so ridiculously silly at times that you wonder if it's on purpose.  Disappointed because the premise of the movie, and the cast involved, are initially very promising.  Disappointed also because you feel as if you've been duped.

Thus describes my experience with ""The Happening,"" the latest M. Night Shyamalan creation.  I actually sat, dumbfounded, shaking my head, while the credits rolled.  I can only rationalize how terrible this film is by either (1) believing the hackneyed story, flaky acting, and disconnected editing were all intentional or (2) Shyamalan is so wealthy, bored and complacent he's now into some heavy, heavy recreational drugs.  To be brutally honest, there is not one saving grace ... the acting defies description, the humor isn't the least bit funny, there are no moments of dread that you expect, even the film score is as overdone, shrill and grating as the acting and story.

A cool idea that was ruined by the ego of a writer thinking he can make a masterpiece that leaves people guessing.  Night is not Hitchcock.

By the end of the movie we are left with nothing but anger.  I'm not saying a cliffhanger is a bad thing.  But this movie gave the viewer nothing.  The acting was poor.

Basically, Mark and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the daughter of a co-worker are literally running against the wind to try and save themselves from a strange and disturbing thing/phenomena that takes over peoples minds and makes them kill themselves.  At first it was assumend that it might be a terrorist attack, but with more and more people commiting suicide, it becomes clear that it's something else entirely.  I was so looking forward to watching this because the storyline to me, seemed enticing, but it wasn't and if I wasn't laughing at the stupidity of it all (the dialogue and the acting etc) then I was close to sleep with boredom.

First the plot: trees are attacking humans to defend themselves...but only in the NE US...and only if there are groups of people.  So if you remain will small groups of people you will survive.  3 months later everything is back to normal; the protagonists are back in Philly...children going to school.  Wouldn't this ""happening"" if it occurred from Boston to D.C. have killed upwards of millions of people?  Wouldn't the entire NE be devoid of humanity much less the schools being open?

Second: the acting and directing.  Mark Walhberg may be one of the worst big-name actors out there; and in this he is unbelievably terrible.  Every line sounds like he is an athlete guest host on SNL reading cue cards (think Michael Jordan and Michael Phelps).

Third: The in your face ""humans are destroying the earth"" diatribe.  From the attacks occurring in cities, the signs of housing developments, to the scenes of a nuclear power plant in the background.  We get it.  Humans are evil.

Shyamalan's movies are getting worse with every release.  Sixth Sense fantastic; Unbreakable interesting; Signs entertaining; The Village ok; Lady in the Water awful; The Happening unwatchable.

Stay away.",1224288000,28,1241,5.044334975369458
1995516,1,6300248291,"You know, I used to think that writer/director M. Night Shymalan was actually a really talented filmmaker; one who knew how to make movies that audiences the world over could enjoy. I mean this was the man that chilled audiences with his breakthrough hit ""The Sixth Sense"", showed us a burgeoning hero coming to grips with who and what he was becoming in ""Unbreakable"", and then explored faith and paranoia in ""Signs"". As good as those movies were, with ""The Sixth Sense"" being the best of them, after only three movies something began to go wrong and we were suddenly given some rather underwhelming films, such as ""The Village"" or the extremely dull and quirky ""Lady in the Water"". Even with M. Night's apparent fall from Hollywood grace due to his previous two efforts, his latest movie looked as if it might actually have what it takes to stand tall amongst the earlier work in his career. However, after watching the recently released ""The Happening"" I have now come to the realization that M. Night Shymalan is officially overrated and that he no longer understands what it takes to make a truly great movie.

""The Happening"" follows a science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), as he tries to grasp what is causing some extremely bizarre events that have begun to plague the people around him. As more and more people begin acting strangely, Elliot senses that perhaps an unseen force is causing humans to do bizarre and violent things to themselves. The further Elliot tries to understand what is happening around him, the more shocking the truth becomes as it appears that humanity may be under attack from the very plants that surround us everywhere.

For some reason I really did want to see this movie when I first saw the trailer. Regardless, of the less-than-stellar results his last two films yielded, I thought that perhaps M. Night Shymalan had once more discovered what he seemed to have forgotten that made his early movies favorites among moviegoers. However, after only getting 20 minutes into ""The Happening"" it was painfully clear that I was wrong, and that M. Night had once again delivered a steaming pile of crap to audiences. Now, I did go ahead and finish this movie, but I couldn't hardly wait for the 90 minute long running time to come to a close so that I could swiftly eject this movie from my player, and soon begin purging the memory of this movie from my mind; sadly I have yet to succeed in doing this completely.

The plot for this movie is such a ludicrous concept, and obviously done in an attempt to cash in on the whole ""Go Green"" craze that seems to be sweeping the nation. I believe even the most ardent ""Green"" supporter will laugh at the sheer stupidity of the notion that perhaps the plant-life of Earth is attempting to kill humanity in response to all the damage we've done to the environment over the years. As if the basic plot for this movie wasn't bad enough, the dialogue was sub-par throughout the entire movie. I don't know what M. Night was thinking when writing this movie, but he seems to have forgotten how to write clever, intriguing, and realistic dialogue for his characters to recite. In place of well-written dialogue we find surprisingly pointless conversations and even a few areas where characters are given a line to say that feels completely out of place given everything they've been experiencing over the course of the film. Essentially, nothing in the story for ""The Happening"" worked for me, and if the studio felt that this would be a nice attempt to cash in on the ""Go Green"" agenda, they were sorely mistaken as this movie made only a paltry amount of money during its mercifully brief stint at the box office.

To top off this movie's horrible excuse for a story, ""The Happening"" also managed to have really talented actors give some of the worst performances of their careers. The movie's lead, Mark Wahlberg (""The Departed""), is an actor who I would normally classify as extremely talented and one of my favorite actor's in the business today; however, this movie really causes one to question what Mark was thinking in signing on for such an obvious flop. For an actor that generally chooses really good roles in typically great movies, this seems like a giant blunder on his part; especially when his overall performance is very uneven and generally uninspired, complete with some poor line readings and unconvincing acting in places. Supporting Mark we have actress Zooey Deschanel (""Failure to Launch"") who does an average job as Elliot's distant wife, although a couple of times her performance seemed to falter, but this could have been caused by the rather dim-witted lines of dialogue her character was given to speak. Rounding out the primary supporting cast we have comedian and actor John Leguizamo (""Righteous Kill""). John is typically a fairly solid character actor, but here I think he was trying too hard to create a quirky character to the point that he ends up becoming more annoying than unique. I must point out that even though the cast had some rough spots in their performances, I believe a lot of the blame must rest with M. Night Shymalan for not giving his actors something worthy of their talents to work with.

At one time writer/director M. Night Shymalan was being heralded as one of the most original filmmakers to hit Hollywood in years, thanks in no small part to the blockbuster successes of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs""; and yet over the course of his career, only half of the movies he has made have actually been worth watching. ""The Happening"" continues the streak of cinematic garbage that M. Night has dumped upon unsuspecting moviegoers hoping for some sort of surprising movie experience, the likes of which we haven't seen since ""The Sixth Sense"". Perhaps with three well-below average movies in a row both studios and audiences will cease to give this overrated hack a chance, at least until he can come up with a story worthy of our attention once again.

For those of you that may have noticed, ""The Happening"" is M. Night Shymalan's first rated R movie, a fact that the studio is heavily touting in their advertising for the recent DVD release; but I honestly can't say that I saw anything in this movie that should have garnered such a rating. Although, I do find it somewhat humorous that the only aspect of this movie the studio's marketing department can choose to focus on is its rating. When something like this occurs it's a pretty clear indication that the movie won't be worth your time or money.

""The Happening"" is rated R for violence and brief language.",1224288000,,6597,4.756331877729258

I liked the plot and the general story...I have to disagree I didn't feel the director had a global warming agenda...this film had as much an agenda about global warming as War Games did about nuclear war...

In terms of other Night films, it was interesting and entertaining as any of his others.  i enjoyed Lady in the Water and Signs.  If you did, you'll enjoy The Happening as well.

My only complaint about this film was that it could have been darker and more demented which is why I only gave this 3 stars.  It started to go there, and then turned back to have a more cartoon/light feel.  Given the subject matter and the dire situation the characters were in, it would have made the film more ""real""...and disturbing.

The acting is decent. The suspense and the unsettling weirdness are there. What isn't there is the payoff. There's no trademark Shayamalan twist, no mind-boggling revelations, no explosive finale that sends you on an emotional roller coaster. There are plenty of plot holes. The ""happening"" itself isn't really explained. No, in fact we're told outright that it was ""something that occurred naturally and may never be fully explained"". I get the impression that M.

Definitely not for those with limited  analytical capacities who can't name which magazines they read or those who have read less than a handful of books in their lives or those out of touch with global news events.

The thrill of this movie is tied to the sudden, unexplainable events unlike anything you've ever seen on any movie before. It instills great fear in the survivors who don't know what to be afraid of. Where do you go and what are you running from if you have no explanation or historical event to compare it to. This is an event which is not in the books and has never been encountered before.

When we bought the movie, the cashier insistently warned us it was a bad movie but she was profoundly wrong. We took a chance on the movie because it was by M. Night Shyamalan whose movies are always fresh and keep you on the edge of your seat but you have to follow everything very closely on his movies.

You have to follow the intricately woven details of events very carefully. His movies are profound and deep and original. I would not recommend this for young children or nervous people. There are a few brief periods of graphic violence but if you hang out at movies for the purpose of seeing gore... this movie will not fill your needs.  I also would not recommend it for shallow thinkers or those with short attention spans because they won't get it.

Baby boomers and those concerned about our world will love this movie. This for for those who can see beyond the surface and those who know there is something seriously wrong on our planet. For those who have seen  the changes all around us (by the way, those abilities are the key to this movie... so you will really enjoy this one)... this movie is definitely for you.",1224201600,6,1880,4.416184971098266

The Good Things
*Video/sound quality is pretty good.  Picture is a little grainy, but it is not overwhelming.
*Includes some featurettes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.
*The movie itself has a very good filming style.  The cameramanship is splendid.  It is particularly interesting how the camera shows the violence in a way that is not too graphic; I think its better that way.
*As I recall hearing, this is the first horror film shot entirely in daylight.
*This film does have its scary, freaky moments.  Some parts genuinely thrilled me.  It also had some dry witty moments as well, and some upbeat parts that provides some contrast to an otherwise dreary film.
*The premise is interesting (even if it is never fully explained what or why all of this is happening).  The script/story has some interesting concepts, such as the relationship between science, math, nature, and humanity. Possibly some allegories between the characters and modern society.  The story is not bad.
*Most people seem to think that the characters/writing/acting is horrid.  I don't really see why; the writing is just as good and interesting as any other movie by M. Night Shyamalan.  The characters are emotional, expressive, and rather touching.  The acting seemed good to me.
*The settings are used quite effectively.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*Not for kids or the extremely squeamish; contains some swearing and violence, including one or two bloody scenes (rated R).
*The plot is kind of weird, and ends a little abruptly.
*One or two laughable moments (although most people seem to think there are lots of laughable moments).
*Slowly paced (although not as bad as some of the other Shyamalan movies, like ""The Village"").

The Questionable Things
*It is never fully revealed what causes the events or why.  I think it's good that way, because it corresponds to the movie's idea that people can never truly explain natural phenomenon.  But it may also be a dissapointment if you were expecting a straight answer.
*Other aspects of the characters and plot are never fully revealed either, and can only be found out by paying close attention or by watching the extras on the disc.

Wow, this movie sure has a bad wrap, and I don't know why.  Were you expecting another ""6th Sense"" movie (again)? Then go watch ""The 6th Sense."" ""The Happening"" is another totally different title in Shyamalan's repertoire, and shouldn't really be put in the same league as his first breakthrough film.  This one has no major plot twist.  It has a straightforward story.  It has no oscar-award-winning performances.  It's simply an apocalyptic thriller, on the same level as Spielburg's ""War of the Worlds"" or Frank Darabont's ""The Mist."" To say that this is anything more is obviously a misconception, but I don't think it deserves to be considered something less.  To do so would be to say that Shyamalan is as bad of a director as Uwe Boll, and I don't think he deserves that.

I thought that this was just as good of a movie as anything else by Shyamalan (although no better than anything else he made either).  I think it had some interesting elements, ideas, characters, and camerawork.  Some parts of it may even make you think (but it is not wholly obvious in the script; you have to really think about it in order to appreciate it).  If you have any interest in his work or intelligent filmmaking in general, give it a try by all means.",1224201600,2,3433,4.805792163543441

Truthfully, the first 3/4 of the film were actually pretty darn entertaining. There was mystery and tention, just a great buildup. But then, the end happened, or uh, didn't.

Though a rationalist science teacher, he knows that certain events in nature are irrational and defy explanation, such as, lemmings committing mass suicide and the sudden inexplicable disappearance of honeybees all over the country.

""The Happening"" has an interesting premise behind it, but it becomes increasingly silly as Wahlberg and company flee the wind that seems to be instigating folks to kill themselves.  I liked the scenes of the wind rustling the grass and the trees in rural Pennsylvania, but they weren't scary as they were meant to be.

1995540,1,6300248291,"You don't have to be a major film fan to realize that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan basically has created movies that slowly go less and less into his first works The Sixth Sense in overall quality. But when it was announced that Fox wanted him to make his first ever ""R"" rated picture, would that be enough to break him out of his never-ending slump?

Nope.

The Happening stars Mark Walberg as a high school science teacher who among everyone else in his Pennsylvania suburb hears that an airborne biological terrorist attack has landed in New York causing it's victims to lose control and find a way to commit suicide. As residents flee towards help, soon they realize that this attack has spread over the Northeastern portion of the United States and that they're right in the middle of it. But is this plague manmade or of a more natural kind? Could it be caused by nature itself? Will anybody know or care after watching this dreck?!!?

I doubt it. While ""M"" and this film try to be all scientific-like interesting, it truly falls amazingly flat. To be honest, this is M. Night's absolute worse film. First, the infected all basically do the same thing which is babble for a second, walk backwards, and find some way to kill themselves, all the while looking like they are still in complete control. Another is the dialouge. While the acting isn't all that great to begin with, I personally haven't heard words written this bad since some kid named Anakin was breaking some pregnant chick's heart. At times I truly felt more for myself watching this than for the victims screaming at the sight of seeing a brisk breeze of air flowing ever so calmly in front of them. Oh my God, WIND!!!!!

However, an ""R"" rating does mean something had to earn it and in a small way it has. Some of the suicides are a bit clever, and yes, even reach R graphicness, but there's just not enough of them to save this movie. In fact, M. Knight himself (through interviews and deleted scenes) cut a few himself, not in fear of the MPAA, but out of thinking less is more. But trust me, the more the merrier really could have helped this fart of a flix. The disc itself does have alot of special features including deleted scenes (that are terrible), documentaries, and also a gag reel (that doesn't have one single blooper....where's the gag?). But no matter what he added to this presentation, nothing could change just how sophomoric and painfully lame this film is.

An amazingly bad movie, without any of the style this director made with his first three films, avoid at all costs. You'll never look at a wind-blown tree in a park the same way again. Because it will now forever remind you of this lame blowhard of a movie.

The sequences in which people committed suicide where stomach churning yet sheltered and a little forced.  I am not asking for gore but it is a given, if it wasn't for these scenes this would have been a bore.  Mark Wahlberg tries his best, with the very vivacious Zooey as his estrange wife at his side, and brings a sort of needed zest to this damaged horror flick.  The cast pushed this dribble into a worthy cinematic experience.  The plot wasn't a strong suit because the film fails to provide an answer to why this is happening and it is only hinted at.  When you see this movie you will understand what I mean, the twists is enough but disappointing in the scheme of things.  The real purpose of this film is the essence of survival and the love that Mark and Zooey's characters feel for each other.  The horrors around them remind them of what is important I applaud Night for this, a real horror/survival movie that is mature yet powerful.

People in the northeast suddenly start killing themselves. A guy deduces it's the plants giving off some chemical. Even though this is the premiss, there really never is any clear, direct evidence that this is what's happening. It suddenly stops happening and no one really knows anything more than they did in the beginning. There's a lame attempt at a twist ending when it looks like it's about to start happening again. If not for a few gruesome and gratuitous deaths thrown in here and there just to keep you awake, pretty much NOTHING else happens. I've seen deeper plots and more intrigue in a few episodes of Scooby Doo.

My guess is this is a case of ""less is more but not enough"".  M. Night Shyamalan overplayed his hand in withholding info. In the best horror movies, it's always what you don't see that's so scary. But I think part of the formula must be that the unseen things must be imaginably horrible. What did we have to imagine here? That the trees were quietly spraying something on us? Ooh-- scary! Couldn't there have been a hint that plants were self aware and plotting this or maybe that they were picking up on our emotions and the ugliness they felt in us was creating the very toxin that they used to kill us?

The Happening, however, was one of the dumbest films I've watched in a very long time! The Happening is the latest film by M. Night Shyamalan in which people mysteriously stop dead in their tracks and begin killing themselves for no apparent reason. The premise itself was kind of scary, but the other storylines and the obvious overacting by Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel grated my nerves. You always expect people to do stupid things in horror movies, but this lot acted like they had lost all sense completely.

The only things that made this movie tense were the cringe-worthy death scenes (Shyamalan made sure to point out that this is his first rated R film) and the stupidity and loss of common sense shared by the characters. Obviously fear causes people to do strange things, but after a while I just didn't care anymore.

Mark Wahlberg should stick what he does best - playing characters out for revenge. His take as a high school science teacher was horrible. The scene at the beginning of the movie where he is in class trying to explain the (true) disappearance of thousands of honey bees recently made me want to scream. For some reason Wahlberg talks to his students, who are at least 15 years of age or older, in a high-pitched patronizing tone. While I would have loved to have had a science teacher like him when I was in high school, the way he talked to his students was extremely annoying. I'm not even going to go into the bad performance by Zooey Deschanel, who plays Wahlberg's wife. I haven't seen much from her, but if I had to go by this performance, I'd tell her to find another career.

So, in closing, do not see this movie. It's not worth your time and I don't think you'll enjoy it very much. I'm glad I only paid $1 to rent it at one of those Red Box kiosks in the grocery store. :)",1223856000,4,1944,4.439775910364146

Shyamalan's camera work is, as always, good, and he was able to stock the movie with good actors -- but you have to give those actors something remotely believable to say!  I think I read somewhere that Shyamalan said this was meant to be a B movie, only the best ever done. In his Legend-in-his-own-mind dreams!

1995548,4,6300248291,"In considering whether to watch this film some of the negative reviews gave me pause. But having seen M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village,' it seemed our tastes and sensibilities might not be the same. I very much liked 'The Village' and found it a tender and thoughtful film. Not at all fast paced but taking the time to carefully follow a natural progression of events, with care and sensibility for the characters. And in the end a message that leaves one thinking.

'The Happening' is in much the same vein, and in both instances the thoughtful direction of M. Night Shyamalan can be felt. Understandable if this not to everyone's taste, only unfortunate that those seeking more traditional Hollywood fare are not familiar enough with his work to know better.

This is a film that can capture your imagination. And if so disposed, your interest until the very end. It might be viewed as a morality play, short on spectacular special effects, but carefully crafted to lead one in a natural progression from one lesson to the next, learning as the characters do. Not so much of themselves but rather their place within this world. Of how we interact with her. Of Mother Nature, loving and cruel at the same time.

Personally I feel M. Night Shyamalan has a very deft touch. One might quibble with certain characters or various points of the plot, but will surely recognize the author is making a very clear statement. Beyond any nuances this may be the most compelling reason to watch this film. Even if disagreeing with the basic premise of 'The Happening,' those attuned to the interconnected nature of this world will surely appreciate that this author was attempting. A lesson we may appreciate all the more in time.

Shyamalan is a remarkable writer and has the ability to use a single idea or concept that relates to our way of life or thinking and transform it to a terrifying and horrific tale.  In this film, he chose to address humanity's interaction with the environment and nature.

I don't understand with all the reviews I read from critics when the movie first came out as well as on the Internet, what people really expected.  The horror scenes were intense and scary.  The dialogue was superb.  The ending was just right.

This story line is not all that unbelievable: entomologist Consuelo De Moraes has shown how the tobacco plant can release airborne chemicals triggered by a caterpillar's saliva to attract a parasitic wasp to kill the caterpillar.

True to the rules of scientific investigation as preached by Mark Wahlberg's character, who is a science teacher in a Philly high shcool, one of the variables in the story is the size of human groups that gets affected.

Other reviewers have mentioned the plastic tree scene, and my opinion is that it would have been fine if there had been other ""light-hearted"" scenes like this to pull you away from the drama then it wouldn't have been so glaring. However, this tree-talking scene was all by itself, therefore making it unnecessary.

I also thought it was stupid that the cause of ""The Happening"" was explained fairly early in the movie, thus leaving out the fun of the audience having to figure it out along with the characters.

OK so the farmer reveals his guess and it turns out to be true so you would think that character would have more of an impact in the movie, traveling with the main characters.

M Nights films have a style and feeling all of their own. As with all ARTISTS, there will be touch and miss, but his films should be seen thru the lens of ART not filmmaking, and I add here a quote from Duchamp ""If we give the attributes of a medium to the artist, we must then deny him the state of consciousness on the esthetic plane about what he is doing or why he is doing it. All his decisions in the artistic execution of the work rest with pure intuition and cannot be translated into a self-analysis, spoken or written, or even thought out.""
Observation #2
The film, like all his others, operates on several deep levels with various messages, such as the old lady representing isolation, etc, but the overall meaning that I personally got from the film was summed up in the interview shown in the end part, where the guy said ""we're killing this planet."" The way he said it, voice inflection, was totally different than any other line in the movie, I think there was a reason for that.
#3
Cinematography is incredible, I agree with a lot of the other reviewers here that the girl that played Wahlbergs wife was a bad actress, Wahlberg was just ok, and John L was absolutely miscast.
#4
Judge his films each on it's own merit. To keep looking for him to do another Sixth Sense is like looking for the Stones to do another Exile On Main Street. Ain't gonna happen. A time for everything.

A sad, ghastly, and ultimately self-indulgent film, rife with Shyamalan's trademark arrogance that was so prominently on display in his last two bombs, The Village and Lady in the Water: scenes of mass suicide that are intended to shock, but instead transcend mean-spiritedness; an unforgivable reference to 9/11, as construction workers leap to their deaths, the sounds of their bodies hitting the pavement on the soundtrack; and a premise so full of self-importance, so pious and lofty, that it inspires unintended laughter.  Let's not forget the banal, flat-line dialogue, poured on so thick that you can almost see Mark Wahlberg--an otherwise gifted actor--actually slipping into his wading-boots.  And don't even get me started on the impossible choice offered to John Leguizamo's character about a third of the way through the movie.  No father would ever, in the infinite amount of space and time, make the decision that his character makes; not when it involves leaving his young daughter in someone else's hands in order to dive heedlessly into harms way to find a wife who may or may not still be alive.  The finale to that particular plot thread is a shameless ploy--ingratiated on us by Shymalan--meant to drag out the tears kicking and screaming.  I wanted to kick the TV instead.

At first, no one knows where this toxin is coming from and it is assumed to be a terrorist attack. The unbelievable part of the story  is how the characters react to this horrifying toxin.  Those who have been exposed, randomly start jumping out of buildings and genrally find ways to kill themselves. Characters who are witnessing this debacle, don't scream, run, or react as real people. But, all to calmly, decide to leave town by taking a train to a relatives house.

The main characters, a science teacher and his despondent wife, have no real passion in their relationship.  And, in my opinion, are not very interesting.  The hero and heroine have not been fully developed and do not make the audience wish for their well being.

Many of the characters in this film are flat and unintersting.  Shyamalan, could have made the charaters more demensional and shared more of the secondary characters' lives. If he had done this, the audience would care whether they lived or died.  He only gives out bits and pieces of personalities that have no substance.

1995560,3,6300248291,"OK...Umm...Uh...OK, just stall words to keep me from getting started. OK, here goes.

First the negative: ""The Happening"" just is not happening as a successful film. Did M. Night really think a movie with the wind blowing trees and grasses would be frightening? Or that the addition of music as a character with the wind would be ominous enough? Perhaps it is with Mark Wahlberg that he expected the movie to be scary. After all, Wahlberg is noted for his intense acting and those serious facial contortions. One scene shows a side view of his face all screwed up. All I could think was how deeply creased his forehead would one day be! A scary movie should not allow me to think that!

However, one of the few really scary parts occurred when the greenhouse guy was in the scene. First, he tells us that plants respond to human voices (true, long-time studies have confirmed this) and that they can respond negatively as well--deep foreshadowing! After the close-up of his misaligned facial features, I fully expected this dude to be hit with neurotoxins and go beserk. Didn't happen. Red herring!

Another really scary part involved the old woman living in isolation, who revealed herself to be beserk without help of neurotoxins. Maybe that was M Night's point: Nature needs to help along the deletion of unsavory human beings, especially including Average Joe (the construction site jumpers--it is no telling what they have done to the plant world!!), but also the truly insane (the old woman who wisely chose to live in the safety of isolation).

I'm going to leave the last three months alone. I could tear into the problems there, too.

Now the positive: Some of these comments are just the reverse of my negative ones. For example, the addition of Wahlberg in the film was a plus because of his intensity. He pretty much makes the whole plant thing  believable--well, almost believable. I was even convinced his and Alma's love stopped the neurotoxins. Actually, because of the mystery entwined throughout the story, there is no reason not to think their love stopped the toxins. In other scenes the galloping fear of toxins seemingly increased the plant rampage.

Overcast skies, wind and music, discordance between words and actions, palpable fear, Wahlberg's panic attack, the Hitchcock-like house and old woman--all lent themselves to an increasing sense of unease to dis-ease. The film does work in some ways.

I leave further arguments to others.",1223683200,69,2460,4.939467312348668
1995561,1,6300248291,"Someone save M. Night Shymalan from himself.  For a man who insists on writing, producing and directing his own movies, he's digging an early grave for his career as a filmmaker and ""The Happening"" has breached the six-foot mark for his burial.  Sporting a lousy script and lousy performances to boot, Shyamalan's much talked-about first R-rated film is a travesty of filmmaking that deserves no better than a 30% rating.  If it were a tomato, it'd be pretty darn rotten.

The film begins in the early morning hours in Central Park.  People are milling about, casually strolling, going about their business.  Two young women sit on a bench chit-chatting when one of them hears a shrill scream and turns her head in the direction of the sound.  What she begins to see after a moderate breeze blows through are people suddenly frozen in their tracks, still as statues, an act that mirrors that of a real-life coordinated event once performed in NY's own Grand Central Station (and I have to wonder whether the film was somehow conceived from that).  As she turns to her friend Claire to tell her what she sees, her friend begins mumbling incoherently and slowly removes the hairpick from her tightly wound chignon, deliberately stabbing herself in the neck.

From there, we are taken to a construction site three blocks away at 8:39 am, only six minutes into the future from the strange occurrence at Central Park.  A body drops from a fatal height and several foremen rush to his aid, only to witness several more men fall to their death.  We are then scooted along to a small high school in Pennsylvania where science teacher Elliott Moore (Wahlberg) is giving an animated lecture at 9:45 am.  He is suddenly pulled aside by the school principal and taken to a room where the entire faculty hears of the strange events in New York.  The American media assumes at first it is some sort of biochemical terrorist attack, due to the fact that only major cities are being targeted while small towns remain safe.  This theory is quickly busted when small towns suddenly fall prey, the safe zones growing smaller and smaller as Elliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel) and fellow teacher and close friend Julian (Leguizamo) try to find a haven from this unseen and presumably unstoppable force.

""The Happening"" glows with promise in its first ten minutes but withers quickly after, leading its audience into a deep dark abyss of disappointment.  At a tight 1 hour and 30 minutes, the film is still agonizingly long, what with its laughable scientific theories and hackneyed performances.  Wahlberg and Deschanel embarrass themselves time and time again, but I have to wonder whether it's really their fault.  Is it due to Shyamalan's joke of a screenplay or his poor direction?  These actors are better than this and their other films are proof of it.  Leguizamo is the only semblance of a saving grace, making the most with what little he's got.  The rest of the cast come and go, largely unknown and largely insignificant still.

Bottom line: There isn't much more to say about ""The Happening"" except that it ain't happening, if you get my drift.  Feel free to watch it and formulate your own opinion if you wish, but don't say you haven't been warned.",1223596800,84,3242,4.7913669064748206

The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director.

What better way to commit career suicide than to create the worst movie ever made with the plot being that the whole Northeastern US kills themselves? It's brilliant!

  I've always been a lot easier on M. Night than many. I actually liked Lady in the Water. This however, left me stunned in it's rediculous plot and horrendously inane writing. An example? They are as legion as the suicides in this movie. Warning! A spoiler,but gee, you have to include at least one. It's irresistable. There's a scene where Mark Wahlberg's character, a whiny schoolteacher named Elliot, (who's dialogue is so inane that it seems like his geek genes have expressed themselves to the point where he can no longer properly show emotion), and his band of suicide endangered people come across a man boarded up in his house who won't let them in. His solution to convince the man that he's ""OK"" is to start singing the Doobie Brothers' ""Black Water""! (Everybody knows he should have sung ""Sweet Home Alabama"").

  If this was a single instance, it probably would be no big deal, but the WHOLE MOVIE is like this. The inconsistancies are so wildly illogical that you're left with thought of, ""How could someone this big in the film industry do a film this bad?!""

2. Why do they keep hiring Zooey Danschanel to ""act"" in movies?  Didn't we learn our lesson in the TV mini-series ""Wizard of Oz""?  OK, her parents were associated with the cinema.  Is that reason enough?  I noticed that her name does not appear in Amazon's credits.  Instead they name John Laguizamo and Betty Buckley, each having much smaller roles than Zooey.  Hmmm.

3.  And just why would stars like Laguizamo and Marky Mark ""tackle"" this project?  No doubt $$ because I'm sure they avoid putting this one in their portfolios.

Worst acting (I really think it was a lack of direction more than acting because Walhberg has done a decent job in most of his other stuff).  Worst pacing.  Name it, it's the worst that M. Night has done to date.  The beginning was ok (well, the idea for the beginning was OK but the actual execution was poor to bad).  The plot was a really good idea.

1995571,3,6300248291,"Say what you will about The Sixth Sense (one of my favorite movies), you can't deny: it set new standards for mystery/suspense films world wide. Any thriller on topic of ghosts or supernatural events or Schizophrenia or anything you'd find in a thriller (Even Untraceable, which was a good movie) would have AT LEAST a BIT of inspiration of The Sixth Sense. And lo and behold, the ugly stepsister from the same director: The Happening. OK, so, M. Night Shyamalan has directed TSS, Unbreakable, Signs (which I thought was OK but slightly disappointing), The Village (Awful movie), Lady in the Water, and now The Happening.

Judging from what you see in the beginning of the movie, something strange is happening- a bunch of people commiting suicide in gruesome and depressing ways. The film evolves into a drama about a family being hit by the same situation. they get evacuated and board a train, and they find out that they have to walk to escape. They soon find out that a Toxin has been released, causing these people to kill themselves.

OK, so, the storyline is interesting, yes. But then the whole ""family drama"" part is where the fil starts to take a downhill slide. None of us know much about these people, and they aren't developed enough. We can't see why we should respect these characters or hope they'll survive. It's just like any other disaster film.

I may be a little generous to give it 3 stars but let me tell you why- You know M. Night Shyamalan tried. He stopped trying to create the most shocking twist ending, and he put forth a cool storyline. The death scenes are pretty cool- very gory and disturbing. The lawnmower scene is pretty gnarly, the arm ripping off scene is a big ""WHOA"" moment, and the ""Hairpin"" scene is what sets the disturbing bang for the movie.

So if you can give this movie credit for what it tried, you may enjoy it. But truth is, this is The Sixth Sense's ugly stepsister, no doubt about it.",1223510400,,1938,4.592485549132948
1995572,3,6300248291,"Review: 'The Happening'
Roving Info: Director: M. Night Shyamalan
The Buzz: James Newton Howard, (in which the score is often errie and filled with actual purpose, fitting the breathtaking cinematography)

A. Let me start by providing you with actual post on Various sites about M. Night's work and The Happening, food for thought to start the review:

---He should make a movie in which he dies, NOW THAT WOULD BE awsome, (sic) I would see it just not to feel bad about throwing my money away with The lady in the water and The happening. What do you think. ---

---Hi Arjun from India here and this guy is just embarrassing to all Indians. He should stop making movies. ---

---He seriously needs to do Bollywood. He can use his ""originality"" there - maybe have the actors dance around in dinosaur suits or something.  --- (or something, riveting!)

---His last 3 movies have been terribble. His storylines are always full of holes and pretty pointless. He should give everyone that went to go see ""The Happening"" the price of there ticket back out of his own pocket. Hopefully the next time he's in a bid to do another movie, some one else is smart enough to remeber(sic) the absolute bombs hes been making, and politely show him to the door---

---I wouldn't rent a Shyamalan DVD even if it came with a free prostitute!---

---Seriously, this guy's career should have been over the day after Unbreakable came out. Not one movie of his since the Sixth Sense has been of any decent quality...NOT ONE! Do us all a favor, Night...blacklist yourself! Told!---(huh?)

---I don't hate the guy personally, but when he showed up with ""The Sixth Sense"" and then ""Unbreakable"" i think i and a lot of others, thought he was a guy who could provide moviegoers with years of great movies.
His output has been close to awful, and declining steadily ever since.
So i don't hate him. I'm just really disappointed---

One can no clearly see the kind of blatant and common ignorance and stupidity amongst the masses, the claim they hate someone because of a certain type of film genre that person doesn't agree with. Morever, the most common element in most M. Night haters, is they don't just hate one of his films, they despise ALL OF THEM, and then throw in their nuances here and there as to why it was 'ok most of the time, but the rest I just didn't get.' Get a wetnap.

Our last friend said he was really disappoinmted, disappointed in what??????????? originality? nonlinear? err, different? Off the beaten path of movie fans who adore live-action, comicbook saturation, and the same people that make Bev Hills Chihuahua the number one grossing movie in the box office of late, and that, that my friends, is the very coinage of our times. What a sad lot.

1. I truly believe that most of the people that despise M. Night, and I am indeed generalizing, couldn't grasp the conceptual understanding that his movies ARE supposed to be that way. The movies are supposed to actually dare you to be different and even on the mass ignorance that abounds on message boards like 'IMDB' and 'Fandango', make you try to think out of the box. His films, especially 'Sixth Sense' and unequivocally 'The Village', take the film goer out of the realm of being and even for two hours, transport you to M's world. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being different AND brillaint? You go make a film and see how ORIGINAL it is. I firmly believe that the lovers of M's movies, are a rare breed, a special kind of movie lover. They attain 'Ken' status of the kind of people I want to surround myself with. Not Ironman fanatics. The folks who I have met who are passionate about movies, think that 'The Village' is one of the greatest films of the last ten years, and I have to agree.
It's hard for people to accept different I suppose. These same Night haters, are going to bash him, prod him and hate his movies, long before they are released, all because they are not part of that circle, they have very limited attention spans, and couldn't for the life of them try to conceptually follow a film like the 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Village'. I would suppose it could be the equivalent of taking someone from a rolling-open admissions community college and dropping them in a full semesters load at Yale.

2. This unbridled ignorance is truly astounding. Like the samples of post on IMDB and the like, the totality of claims of why the haters, completely loath his films and career is clearly evident. ""His movies suck, he sucks, they are boring and pointless and they don't make sense"" Hmm, nice argument. In my time off of recent, I have sifted through 100's of post, and for the most part, the reasoning or lack there of, is purely the same. Personally, I am not a fan of sketch comedy type films, anything with Will Ferell or the like, and not a Cohen Brothers fan, I don't enjoy chick flicks, or anything with Martin Lawrence. I believe Lucas should have left the Star Wars Series where it was at in the seventies and eighties and not made the abomination of the later three we were mauled into watching. I think Taratino is as untalented of a director as The Rock is to his acting ability, however, and I mention all these personal opinions, to say I would take an M. Night film, albeit even bad, any day of the week, month or year, over what is in the box office today.

The Film:::::::While I do agree with most folks assessment on the nature of The Happening being feverishly boring to the point of yawning many times, and lacking appropriate suspense, I found it rather intriguing. My major problem with the film was the wooden characters, and that would reflect poor writing and directing, however, that doesn't mean the person is bad at his profession period. It is strange to me the often non tangible characters in the film, especially Walhberg's role, considering M. Night's expertise at amazing dialouge and interactions. I didn't often heavily care whether they escaped the toxin, could care less about his wife, and don't really care about anyone else they picked up along the way. However, the plot is in an element all its own, and if you haven't seen it, ignore these haters and naysayers and see for yourself, with an open and shrewd eye to something different. The film has M. Night's signature on it, as if I were screening it without any credits not knowing who's it was, I would without question, say Night did this film. Original, thought provoking and mildly entertaining. People here can dissect each element of the film, and dog it, bring it down in ratings, and use their splendid fingers to tell us just why it was so bad. The same way those, perhaps same people, use unwarranted claims as to why films like Death Proof are revolutionary.

There are very few movies that I actually go to see in the physical theatres. Anytime an epic comes out like 'Troy', '300' or stuff like 'Dances With Wolves', because of the totality and grand majesty of such a film that only can be appreciated on the big screen. That said, the one director, save Speilberg for the most part, that I always will go see is M. Night, hate him or love him, he certainly causes an uproar in the online movie loving community. Why? Because he is different, and makes us think, and brings us films that few, IF ANY, director can in todays saturated market of blockbusters and cookie-cutter talent.

In conclusion: While the film may not be for the everyday movie goer, it certainly has its market. No it wasn't the best film, in fact it wasn't the best Night film by a long shot, but it was still unique, interesting and different, and for that alone, I enjoyed it intensely. The haters can't like it, they aren't capable of liking it, they will never like ANYTHING he does, and they are increasingly annoying. If you don't like his movies, then DONT GO SEE THEM, if you think they are going to be awful, then don't waste your money, if you cant stand him being different and cutting edge with ideas that make our minds wonder and yearn for more, then don't SEE HIS MOVIES. There are a lot of us that do like M. Night, and nothing you can say will ever change that fact.",1223510400,4,8145,4.568493150684931

There are a few bloody moments thrown in, I guess, to make this seem more like a horror movie but they end up just being gross.  Mark Wahlberg is completely inept at playing an average Joe nice guy.  He needs to stick to the tough guy roles.  The only actor in the movie that is believable is Betty Buckley as the crazy old hermit woman.  My advice is don't waste your time or money on this one.  M.

You'll spend most of the time watching wondering how a movie with pretty big-name actors in it could be so bad. Wahlberg at his worst. The funny thing is: John Liguisamo is an oasis of good acting, which contrasts and UNDERSCORES how the sub-par performance by the others.

It was designed as an apocolyptic thriller combined with a side story of the two main characters (played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) rediscovering their love for each other during the deadly attack that occurs throughout most of the movie.

I'll give my reasons as to why this movie failed:

1) ZERO chemistry between Wahlberg and Deschanel.
2) Deschanel was wooden and emotionless for most of the movie. She is not a good actor.
3) John Leguizamo seemed to be wondering ""Why can't I get better scripts than this?"" Though he made the most of the material he was dealt.
4) Wahlberg's part is so terribly written that you can see him struggling to find his character's identity for the entire movie. He ultimately settles on some bland, wimpy personage devoid of any personality whatsoever.
5) The apocolyptic thriller has been done way better by others. Even The Day After Tomorrow did a better job.

I gave this movie 2 stars mainly due to the beautiful cinematography. This IS one of M. Night's strengths, after all. But with this effort, he moves closer to Spike Lee as a director who places style over substance. Maybe M. Night should hire a real Hollywood writer from time to time rather than pen these movies himself. Because after watching this disaster, you get the feeling that Shyamalan is in a little over his head. He clearly needs some help with story ideas and scriptwriting.

The fact that it really only hints at all of its different notions (bee disappearance, government experiments etc.)actually strengthens the film as the viewer is left to fill in the blanks.  What is strange about this production is its uneven tone, due to some campy scripting, acting and special effects.  Some scenes are really only missing Mike Nelson, Crow and Tom Servo in the bottom hollering at Mark Wahlberg and company.  I enjoyed myself in a drive-in theater kind of way.  The movie is heavy handed, wildly uneven in production value and tone and has one of the least satisfying endings ever.  Somehow I still didn't mind going along for the ride here as there is political allegory and more to be found if you look hard enough.  Best as a rental unless you collect M.

1995591,1,6300248291,"The sixth sense was an absolute masterpiece, and that fact still makes me give any M. Night Shyamalan (Shy) movie a chance.  However Shy's movies have gotten progressivly worse, culminating with this atrocity.

Reason No. 1 this movie was bad.  Acting
Who can forget Haley Joel Osment's haunting portrayal in The Sixth Sense or that of Toni Collette, who played his mother, or Bruce Willis in arguably his best role?  Zooey Deschanel was awful.  I have seen better acting in high school plays.  John Leguizamo was completely under utilized.  Whalberg did the best he could with bad dialog.

Reason No. 2 this movie was bad.  The Script was Horrible
Shy tries to give the movie a basis in science but his logic is impossible to follow.  Nothing about the major plot points make any sense.  For example, A train stops in the middle of nowhere becasuse they have lost contact with ""everyone"".  How does a national train system lose contact, when we have been told the event is localized to the northeast U.S. and cell phones and national media coverage are still running?  The premise that plants were releasing a toxin into the air was interesting but it was never fully developed.  There was no shocking reveal at the end, no payoff (like sixth sense or the village), just some lame eco babble about the planet sending us a message.

To sum up.
The dialogue is weak and directly impacts the performance of the actors.  The suspense never really mounts and although there is some disturbing imagery there are absolutely no scare moments.  The story is nonsensical and never goes anywhere. This is not even a renter.",1223337600,52,1613,4.765342960288809

Its been a looooong time since I've seen actors phone in their performances like Wahlberg and Leguizamo have done here.  NO, WAIT!  Tim Allen in ZOOM, yeah, its about that speed.

Truth is, though, when things fall apart, I'm a ""blame the director"" type of viewer (but come on guys, didn't you watch the dailies???).  Fascinatingly misdirected by Shymalan, you will swear you're watching a student film.  And I liked everything he did up 'til Lady in the Bathtub.

1995594,2,6300248291,"It just happened.  Whatever is was, it was atrocious.  M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie may leave you asking, what happened to make me watch this?  Maybe Mark Wahlberg?  I respect that Shyamalan is an innovator.  ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs"" are all evidence that he is willing to step outside the box.  So what went wrong with ""The Happening""?

The story was very far fetched...a neurotoxin being carried by the wind is making people feel confused, hallucinate and then kill themselves.  People are in a state of panic and flee as far away as they can.  Eventually the groups of people whittle down to Elliot Moore (Wahlberg), his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and Elliot's colleague's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez).  But, where does the neurotoxin come from?...is it terrorists?...is it a nuclear gas leak?...nope it's a chemical reaction from plants.  Beware.

""The Happening"" was just ridiculously bad.  The dialogue was poor and some scenes were just incredibly stupid, especially the one where Mark Wahlberg pleads with a plastic plant to spare his life.  Not to mention, the ending was a little reminiscent of ""28 Weeks Later"".  Did Shyamalan get lazy?  Who knows?  But what do you expect with a film that only took 44 days to complete.

1995596,3,6300248291,"I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film. Inundated with previews for the film prior to its release, talk of how director M. Night Shyamalan was the next best thing since John Carpenter when it came to horror and a personal recommendation that it was bad made me stop. But when it came in I decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad I did.

The film starts in New York, Central Park where people suddenly stop in their tracks. The silence is chilling and what follows even more so as people begin to harm themselves.

Move to Philadelphia and a high school where science teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is teaching a group of students about the effects of change in nature. Called out of the office, the teachers are told there has been an apparent airborne attack in New York, possibly by terrorists.

As people try and rush out of the big city to avoid a second attack, Moore meets up with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter Jess. Elliott and Alma are in the midst of a relationship crisis that Julian has seen coming, feeling cold towards her since he and Elliott are friends.

The airborne pathogen seems to be spreading, hitting more and more major metropolitan areas. As the train taking our travelers reaches a small town outside of the major city, it stops. The reason why? No one is answering their calls up and down the line. This is the last stop.

Julian hears that the city his wife was headed for was hit and sets out to find her leaving Jess in the care of Elliott and Alma. What he finds when he reaches his destination is gruesome and startling and its effect on him chilling.

Elliott's group carries on and they find a ride. But when they come to a crossroads, cars are coming from all directions, each one with the revelation that further on down the road are people who have been killed. Setting out on foot, it is Elliott who learns the secret of how this is happening, based in part on what one of his fellow travelers said early on.

To tell you the cause of this event would be to spoil the surprise. Myself, I knew and it didn't faze me. If you don't want to know, stop reading now.

It turns out the cause of the entire even was Mother Nature taking back what is hers, the planet. The airborne pathogen is not man made nor launched as a terrorists attack. It is a compound emitted by the plants that blocks the receptors in the brain that help man from harming himself. Once gone, it also increases their desire for self destruction, thus the mass deaths as a result of suicide.

Elliott realizes that the attacks from the plants are focused on only large groups of people. Split into smaller groups, their chances of survival increase. But even then they have to face each other and the fears of who is to blame.

Scenes of self destruction and death run rampant and may upset a few viewers. Gore hounds will be disappointed they don't go further. But the fear instilled here of an unseen enemy with no form of defense against it makes for a truly frightening film.

Wahlberg is showing that he has the chops to become a great actor. The true gift is when an actor is so immersed in the character that you don't think of him as that celebrity but as that character. Wahlberg is becoming that sort of thespian. The rest of the cast holds up equally well, although Deschanel's character is offered little to do until near the end of the film.

This film has taken hits left and right by critics and fans alike. I'll admit that its not the greatest film ever made. But it harkens back to the days of the end of the world films from the 50's that had some unknown creature or fear that caused man to panic and lose track of what was important. It made me think back to those scary films that relied on emotions instead of gore related effects to induce fear.

The movie lives in that world, a world where the unknown boogie man, the creature that never raises its head until it attacks, the monster in the closet that is never seen lives. To think that nature itself could decide that it had had enough, that man was the disposable entity in this world that could be removed, is a terrifying thought.

Shyamalan may not equal Carpenter in my eyes (I'm a big John Carpenter fan) but he does seem to have a knack for making ones skin crawl. This was a nice change after my disappointment in THE VILLAGE. If you're looking for a truly creepy film for a month when those sorts of films are sought out, this one should foot the bill.",1223337600,,4525,4.3971291866028706
1995597,1,6300248291,"Save for ""The Sixth Sense,"" I can't say that I care for any of Shyamalan's work.  The only other one that I somewhat enjoyed was ""The Village,"" that though a highly improbable scenario, provides the audience with a good twist at the end.  With ""The Happening"" we enter a new realm of preposterous with a film that is executed so poorly that it borders on the laughable and not in the way that a good b-movie can be.  After pretty exciting opening scenes, the movie grinds to a mind-numbing halt, as quickly, the characters are introduced and they are about as likeable and believable as a snobbish $5.00 streetwalker who just happens to be Nietzsche scholar. Good actors are reduced to uttering ridiculous dialogue and hack their way through some unbelievably stupid scenes, such as Mark Wahlberg telling everyone to try to outrun the wind (can you imagine??) or apologizing to a houseplant for man's offenses only to realize that it's plastic.  I know the latter was meant to provide a moment of levity in a grim predicament, but it's pulled off so ineptly that rather than laughing along with the character, you're merely laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all.  Then there's the scene where the train passengers find themselves stranded in a little town and eating at the local diner. After watching a newscast, panic sets in and everyone takes off in their cars, leaving behind our four principal characters.  One question:  Where did all these train passengers get the cars they left in?  Either a). The car fairy placed one under selected placemats or b). The entire population of the town just happens to be willing to carpool with a bunch of outsiders (as was the case with Leguizamo's character).  There was no pleading on behalf of the passengers for the town folk to allow them to tag along, no terror induced screaming, arguments or fighting.  Everyone just jumped into their respective vehicles and took off like friends with a case of the trots heading home after eating a rancid meal.  Nothing encourages neighborly discourse among strangers like an unseen menace prowling in the vicinity. Zooey Deschanel seemingly had two expressions at her disposal:  Googley eyed and very googley eyed.  Everyone just seems bored and I couldn't wait for it all to come to an end.  I took not an ounce of interest in any of these people.  Far from sympathetic they were irritating and  hour into the flick, I was hoping they'd do themselves in, too.  Maybe Deschanel could have torn her own eyes out.  Lord knows those peepers were willing to meet her halfway or Wahlberg could have bored himself to death by rambling on nonsensically about his trite theories.  I can't quite remember when was the last time I disliked a movie as much as this one, but I guess since I was so looking forward to it only to be rewarded with the most preachy, arrogant and down right annoying piece of celluloid to pass for a film in sometime, I was unwilling to be  forgiving.  This movie is an insult to the film going public and, no doubt, all those involved with this fiasco must be asking themselves...""what the hell was I on when I took on this train wreck of a movie: .Horse tranquilizers and grain alcohol?""  It's hard to believe that this piece of cinematic excrement was created by the same person who produced one of the greatest supernatural thrillers in film history.",1223337600,14,3364,4.7243150684931505

1995600,1,6300248291,"This was certainly the worst movie of the summer, including even The Love Guru, and one of the most unpleasant moviegoing experiences I've ever had.  First, those who point out that the R was for marketing are absolutely correct.  The tone is no different than any other Shamalan film-Contemporized twilight zone with corny, tepid dialogue.  (Spoiler alert)
There is no violence to speak of, except, except for repeated grisly suicide after grisly suicide.  Is there a point to showing the act of suicide over and over?  Do the elaborate and highly stylized suicide rituals make sense within the framework of the plot?  Does Shamalan care if there is a coherent plot?  I think the answer to all of these questions is no.
Shamalan starts with an eco-horror premise, the plants are out to scare us into being more environmental friendly, laid out only through bad dialogue and teased as a ""theory,"" although the alternative theory is never actually scrutinized.  He then absolutely drives a stake through the heart of it with bad dialogue, bad pacing, bad acting and multiple incosistencies.
For instance, in the scenes involving Marky Mark, the plants are only killing people in large groups (i.e. more than four people or so), yet scenes nominally at the same time, the plants kill a lone pre-teen girl and a car containing four people.  Those type of inconsistencies, as well as the weird tone caused by the R rating, completely prevent suspension of disbelief, leaving us with thin, unlikeable characters and wooden acting.

I want to be shocked, teased, appalled, even made angry at going ons on film.  I want the director's and screenwriters that I watch to have original and yes even WAY out there ideas.  I'm just a guy from N.C. that works as a chef.  I am in no way a film critic, I'm not a director with years of experiance and a gifted and expansive imagination.  So, I tire of people bashing films that are out of the norm, or ""crazy"" just because it's ""not what's expected"" for that genre of film.

I adore M. Night, his films ALL OF THEM...from Sixth Sense to the beautiful adult fairy tale of Lady in the Water. (which I personally think was one of his best films...go ahead and hit me, that film was original, well acted and yes, dare I say; DIFFERENT.) So I knew I would love this film. And...I did.

Mark Wahlberg did a wonderful job playing a more toned down, less action heavy character.  Zooey Deschanel is so beautiful, and although she was a bit monotone with her vocal acting her doe like eyes conveyed so much.  The premise was great!  The unexplained suicides were interesting and shocking at times (the Lawn mower, ewwh.) I enjoyed the twist as well. (which i won't give away here.)

It seems to me, the majority of moviegoers who see the M. Night name above a movie, expect it to be as pitch perfect as The Sixth Sense.  He's a director, he's supposed to do different things.  No one should stay in the ghost story, jump scares, HUGE plot twist style that started their career. That's why they have a career. To grow and do new and wildly different things.

1995603,4,6300248291,"One thing M. Night Shyamalan has working against him is the fact that the studios always make his movies out to be horror. They aren't and he is not the only producer who has this problem.

In interviews prior to the opening of this movie, M. Night Shyamalan stated that this would be the best B movie you have ever seen.... and it is exactly that. I sometimes wonder if reviewers make any effort to read about a movie before they go into a theater, or if they just watch a preview (Which usually is an inaccurate representation of the movie, IMO) and pay the money on basically blind faith or in some cases giving themselves an opportunity to complain and make themselves look big.

Here is my review of the movie, The Happening. Take it as you will, but before you watch this movie, keep in mind that it was indeed meant to be a B movie.

The Happening balances a little horror, suspense, and humor and rolls it into one film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and make you leave the theater (hopefully) thinking. It is true that there are graphic scenes of suicide and is definitely not for children or anyone who takes offense to that subject matter. It is also true that there is a touch, ONLY a touch, of global warming side notes but it is not offensive to the average person. All in all, I personally enjoyed the movie and have already preordered it to watch again with the bonus footage.

This is not an awful movie, perhaps disappointing to some who put total faith in the previews. To those who find this movie awful... watch Killer Clowns from Space.",1223078400,,1577,4.3720136518771335
1995604,2,6300248291,"I had really high hopes for this one in wanting MNS to make a popular and successful film that customers will want to see. Every once in awhile I do an in-store sampling (random customers watch the films on the HD display and give feedback) prior to release to see how the release might fare (big mistake with this one).

Out of 136 customers who filtered through last night whilst displaying the movie, 100 said they will not be renting or buying it now, 25 outright walked away laughing and several kids liked it. Needless to say, this movie was very disappointing. The lead performances, storyline, special effects, and writing were all sadly poor and subpar. Those stories I heard about in theaters of people laughing when the movie had meant to scare you or make you feel sad rang true here too. What I did notice was an unplanned target audience materialized - 12 to 14 year olds. Each kid liked it due to either the corny scare factor or the fake gore. Seven or eight 15-16 year olds walked through that had already seen it and all stated the movie sucked.

So anyway, technically the BD has some nice offerings. All the featurettes and extra tidbits are as they are listed here, and most are in 1080. The trivia track actually turned out to be boring on the facts, but it does allow you to incorporate all of the extra features on the disc while watching the film. The deleted scenes were mercifully removed as they were atrocious, and as MNS admitted in the intros to them - they detracted from the film he had wanted people to see - especially all the extra gore. One thing on this BD I had not seen before was the ability to mute the main menu music (if left idling). The wind effects sound great on the DTS HD, and the transfer looked flawless; so much so that the CGI effects looked really bad.

I can see why this movie fared poorly, and I know ZD and Marky Mark are way better actors than they show here. The best summary I can come up with is: that volumes of people kept laughing as they listened to the film (while shopping in the store); Mostly due to how corny all the acting/lines/character interaction sounded, let alone how bad it looked while watching it. Watch it for the sound and clarity - skip it for every other reason thinkable.",1223078400,5,2258,4.423076923076923

1995610,2,6300248291,"A good film maker can make an incredible story look credible and M.Night Shyamalan has done so marvelously in The 6th Sense. But every production he has touched ever since has become more and more ludicrous. Personally I gave up on him the second the final and short of believable plot twist in The Village was unfolding before my eyes.

The story would promise for a popcorn bag full of entertainment. However I was once again fooled and subjected myself to another 90 minutes with a pretentiously moralistic ending. The supernatural high gloss thriller one might expect borders on B-movie qualities, and this is not meant as a compliment.
As others have mentioned, the acting is quite terrible, but then again I have a hard time figuring out whether Zoey Dechanel for instance is acting badly or whether the lines she has are just terribly written. Possibly both?

Clearly this film could have done without the violence as all of M.N.Shymalan's other films have. Please note that the film posters had a big red R plastered on them and sure enough, every leading actor made sure to emphasize the R rating on every late night interview they appeared on. Clearly a marketing gimmick to raise the curiosity of viewers who gave up on him.

M.N.S. has blamed Buena Vista for poor advertising, the lack of critical acclaim and a decline in ticket sales from one production to the other. Warner Bros took him in. Next thing we know, he released his biggest flop to date: Lady in the Water. Why is it that us viewers don't finally understand that his streak of success has been long over?",1222041600,7,1581,4.700361010830325
1995611,2,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan is known for his highly atmospheric melodramas with supernatural overtones. Think ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Village,"" and ""Signs."" The director's newest film, ""The Happening"" -- his first R-rated effort -- bears his trademark eerie moments, mysterious occurrences, shocks, and outright creepiness.

One day, in Central Park, masses of people become disoriented, stop dead in their tracks, and walk backwards. Nearby, at a high-rise construction site, workers plummet to their deaths one after another as they walk off the girders above. Something very unusual is happening, but no one knows what. The first guess is a terrorist attack. After all, it is New York City, and memories of 9/11 are still vivid.

High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is summoned to a meeting of the staff and informed of the happening. Elliot, wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), colleague and friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) decide things will be safer outside the city and board a train to Pennsylvania. As the train makes its way to Philadelphia, cellphone calls to folks on the crowded train reveal that the odd behavior is spreading. Is it terrorism, radioactive leakage from a nuclear power plant, a freak air-based virus?

""The Happening"" plays very much like an episode of the original ""Twilight Zone."" It has that somber, foreboding quality and draws us in immediately with a sensationally effective opening sequence that is both riveting and shocking. Shyamalan incorporates a number of reaction shots of individuals observing the devastating behavior of their friends and co-workers, so that we experience the horror through their eyes. Shyamalan's Everyman is Elliot, who is conveniently a science teacher so that he can cobble together a plausible speculation about what's happening all over the East Coast.

Wahlberg does a fine job of being both the average Joe caught in an extraordinary situation and the guy who manages to avoid succumbing to whatever it is that's affecting human beings. Could this be vegetation -- trees, bushes, plants -- forming chemical defenses against man for decades of polluting the planet? Some of his conclusions may not be 100-percent accurate, but they're good enough to keep him, Alma, Jess, and a few others they meet along the way alive when others are dying around them in gruesome, self-inflicted ways.

The movie has its problems. From a superb beginning, it bogs down and drags when it should be bristling with suspense. For its R rating, it is surprisingly timid in its visuals. We hear, for example, about horrendous things happening in surrounding areas, but seldom see them. Why? This isn't a radio play. It would have been far more effective to show assorted examples of man's fatal disorientation in montage format, thus enhancing the scope and grimness of the unknown outbreak. Starting with a brutal intensity, ""The Happening"" eases into a road trip to nowhere, as the ranks of the survivors thin and Elliot and a few others seem destined to be the last living humans on earth.

Late in the film, Shyamalan introduces the character of Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), a reclusive eccentric bordering on psychotic. Her presence in the film is puzzling. She provides some creepy moments, but they lead to dead ends. There's nothing wrong with a red herring, but it has to misdirect. The Mrs. Jones character is simply a curiosity and fails to provide any new information or advance the plot.

Shyamalan likes control. He is credited as writer, director, and one of the film's three producers. So on his shoulders rests the responsibility of fashioning a complete, effective motion picture, not merely a series of clever episodes. The film is reminiscent of those 1950's sci-fi films where some prehistoric beast comes to terrorize and destroy a major city and mankind has to organize quickly to destroy it. The concept worked for over a decade. ""The Happening"" wants to depart from this formula by making the threat more intangible and thus more frightening. How can you confront an enemy when you don't know what that enemy is? A good idea, but two-thirds of the way through we become tired of wondering what the ""thing"" is that is causing people to become suicidal.

Shyamalan loves The Big Secret -- a major plot point he withholds from viewers until a crucial, climactic point. It worked beautifully in ""The Sixth Sense,"" far less effectively in ""Unbreakable."" ""The Happening"" falls somewhere between these two films in effectiveness. It needs a wallop of an ending. Instead, it ends in an anticlimactic whimper.",1221955200,8,4623,5.113907284768212
1995612,4,6300248291,"It sounds like many who saw The Happening were looking for a ""6th Sense"" twister ending or ""Saw"" level gore fest, and this film is neither.  The arrogance of man in the face of nature and/or nature fighting back is not a new idea. Writers have addressed this over the last 150 years including Stephen Crane (Open Boat), Jack London (To Build A Fire), Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) and Terry Gilliam (12 Monkeys, which interestingly does have a twist ending and Bruce Willis). As with M. Night's best films, this is a sharply defined character study shaped by events beyond the control of the individuals involved, and this is what gives the film its humanity. The idea that a toxin of some sort is shutting off the self-preservation mechanism in humans leading to their own demise, is not a far-fetched one.  And at every turn, we are treated to media takes on the events, which start with terrorism and end with government cover-up, writing off environmental possibilities entirely, though we have been equally treated to examples  concerning similar real natural occurrences throughout the film.
Most Americans' scientific/medical interest and education doesn't extend much beyond concerns over the download speed of their i-phone or picking up their happy pills from the local Walgreen's.  As a result, most are too ignorant on this level to grasp the potential reality of such an event.  They know nothing of the days when microbes swept through entire cities as the common cold does today, but with a staggering death toll instead.  They know nothing of the largely smoothed over discoveries about the SSRI drug class, which may cause normally docile people to violently and mortally hurt themselves or others; a fact reduced to a warning label and extra FDA mandated handout about suicidal ideation (see DeGrandpre's ""Cult of Pharmacology"" from Duke University Press).  Sadly, the point is lost on the very people who need to hear it most.
The film re-uses many suspense devices from film history.  My only quibble with The Happening is that the crazy old lady could have been better used than merely to amp up the suspense, since she was the one person in the whole movie who had actually divorced herself from the trappings of ""civilization"" and tended to her garden.

As events unfold you begin to discover the horror and the mystery behind a massive epidemic on the east coast.  M. Night Shyamalan definitely knows how to take fantastic events and make them seem plausible in reality.  This film definitely creates a realistic story that takes everyday life and injects it with sudden and unexpected horror.  I think all of his movies are genius and that the only reason he gets panned by critics is because he stands out in Hollywood and is one of the only screenwriters/directors who creates absolute original ideas for movies.  You don't see him doing sequels or bringing back old movies from the dead and doing remakes.  He truly creates original stories.  As theater goers drop in attendance, the total movie gross on the first weekend goes down considerably and therefore any mention of how much a movie made at the theater becomes more and more negligible or in other words, meaningless.  Besides most theaters only seem to show movies that are geared towards those who have pretty good access to disposable income: Teenagers.  Thinking movies will not last long, if at all, at mainstream theaters (i.e. Carmike, AMC theaters).  Theaters are going to show pure bubblegum.  Last time I drove by a Carmike cinema here's what was showing: ""The House Bunny"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Bangkok Dangerous"", ""Righteous Kill"" and the list continues.  These are not meant for the imagination, they are simply meant to be shallow and gratuitous macho man movies or teenage fantasy flicks.  M.

 I seriously laughed at every scene it was so contrived and retarded! The dialog was so-so-so-so-so BAD!!! The acting was horrible. It had no plot and no point other than plants want to kill us.
 M Night is by far one of the worse filmmakers in the history of the art. Not since John Waters or even Ed Wood have I seen such a total crap attempt at filmmaking.

1995617,1,6300248291,"I went into this film hoping for something that would actually make me regain some faith in Shyamalan's work.  The studio was hyping the ""R"" rating to a degree that rivaled any picture coming out of Lucasfilm.  So what did I feel like we got with this?
THE BIGGEST TEASE EVER.  The ""R"" Rating was at a complete minimum of the rating scale, with the exclusion of two fairly cheap looking scenes the film could have easily been another PG-13.  So I felt ripped off about that.  However the biggest issue for me was the fact that the film seemed to build and build and build.  The suspense build was great until the ""MacGuffin"" was exposed, after that the film just seemed to lose it's edge for me.  I sat there waiting for something to happen, waiting for some kind of climactic shock or emotional stir.  However that never came, as much as I like Wahlberg and Deschanel as actors I found myself really not caring at all what happened to them in the end.
I found the propaganda in the film to be annoying and weak as well.  I don't want to spoil things as much as some people have but I do wish that some film makers would leave their personal agendas out of films that are simply meant to entertain us.

In closing, I was very disappointed by this film. For having somewhat enjoyed Lady in the Water I was hoping that Shyamalan had found his footing again, but I was mistaken.  For me the best part of the film was laughing at the fact that France was now doomed!",1221004800,10,1462,4.318681318681318
1995618,1,6300248291,"M. Night Shaymlian strikes out again with The Happening, which further shows what an over rated hack he is. The Happening does have an excellent premise which if given to a director like Frank Darabont could have easily been an excellent psychological thriller like last year's overlooked The Mist. Mark Wahlberg who happens to be one of my favorite actors provides one of his worst performances since The Truth About Charlie. Wahlberg displays no chemistry with Zooey Deshunal and watching the movie it's as if all the actors were method acting. There are two redeeming things about The Happening though; the first is the short running and the second is a scene involving a lawn mower. I wont's give any details about the scene other than it's one of the funniest on screen deaths of the year. Wahlberg will have a chance to redeem himself later this year with the video game adaptation Max Payne; as for Shamilan unless his makes a mini series about New Edition it'll be hard for me to ever support any of his movies again.",1220745600,9,1025,4.7

The performances are solid, and delivered with respect to the intended style.

1995620,2,6300248291,"Confession: I watched this movie and thought it was unrelentingly, embarrassingly bad. It looked pretty good, it had that Shyamalan style, but so much of the dialog felt bullied onto the characters. I couldn't believe how unnatural it sounded, how forced and amateurish it felt for the purpose of filling in plot. And it's a message flick--""we've abused the planet so don't be surprised if it fights back some day""--and message flicks, in my experience, are the worst offenders in the bad movie department because the message, and trying to make the point, often get in the way of making a good film.

Then I read a brief comment from a reviewer at the MRQE: ""Shyamalan doesn't conform to the needs of modern movie goer zombies. It doesn't mean he sucks. It means you don't get it. At least someone still takes risks in the ART of cinema. It's not unintentionally hilarious. It's a blatantly comedic satire.""

Whoa! That changes everything. Satire gives Shyamalan a free pass from ridiculous straight through to funny; except I'm not sure what he is satirizing. Himself? Message movies? Horror movies? Science? What? Doesn't satire involve an obvious subject in order for the satire to be got? I'm not going to hold the MRQE reviewer to his literal words because if The Happening is ""blatantly comedic"" I have lost my sense of humor completely. There is the part with the greenhouse guru--who pretty much solves the mystery of the Event by declaring that plants, because they can't run around and throw punches, develop neurotoxins to fight off threats to their existence--and his ironic enthusiasm for bringing hot dogs along on the getaway trip. That was funny. When he asks Mark Wahlberg and then Zooey Deschanel if they like hot dogs, they both respond negatively, but not so much as in ""No, they give me the creeps"", but more like ""Not really, but more importantly your enthusiasm for them is giving me the willies.""

Satire can also bring forgiveness to plot wonders and plot holes. One of the more uncomfortable moments in the film for me is when John Leguizamo decides to turn back and go into the dead zone to look for his wife. He is about to entrust his daughter's safety to Mark and Zooey but when Zooey reaches out to take his daughter's hand John barks at her: ""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it."" On paper the line is in character, perhaps, but in performance it's way out of line. Are we supposed to laugh at the pain in Zooey's eyes as she reacts to this idiotic ungratefulness? I dunno. I don't get it. Shyamalan could very well be forging a new path, creating his own rules for satire, or deconstructing it and tossing aside certain aspects, like humor, for the sake of his art.

There's the famous bit of dialog from the movie trailer where Wahlberg confronts the getaway train conductor (or whatever he is) about why they can't get back on the train and keep going. The conductor says, ""We've lost contact."" Wahlberg asks, ""With who?"" and the conductor replies ""Everyone."" That seems pretty final until a few scenes later where a woman is talking on her cell phone to her daughter who's back in the infected zone. Mark walks up like Jack from the TV show Lost and offers instructions to pass along to the daughter of the hysterical woman who puts the call on speaker-phone so we can all hear her daughter die. Cut. There's the scene where someone whips out an iPhone and plays a high quality video that was just sent to them from someone in the infected zone. I'm not going to tell what the video shows, suffice to say it's blatantly comedic. As is the notion of running away from the wind but I'm not bringing that up.

I have an extremely high tolerance for the gravity of plot as it weighs on a story. I'm not deducting points for inconsistency; I'm deducting points because so many of the scenes are played so badly. And the story is stupid. Yes, playing the satire card shines a new light on everything but I'm not sure it makes anything more attractive. I'm reminded of a Seinfeld episode where an elderly couple are admiring a giant portrait of Kramer and the guy says something to the effect of ""It's obscene. I can't turn away."" Honestly, that's how I feel about The Happening. It's so bad it has to be brilliant. But blatantly comedic? I'm not so sure. Your mileage may vary.",1220313600,5,4321,4.635770234986945

1995624,4,6300248291,"The Happening is a solid effort from M. Night Shyamalan. It is not his best work, but does cover new ground creatively. I was honestly disappointed that he chose to make an R-rated film. After seeing it, I have to agree that the R rating was necessary to the story.

This movie is not meant to be another The Sixth Sense. It is supposed to be a strait forward thriller/horror film. M. Night has never attempted to hide the fact that he idolizes Alfred Hitchcock. This movie absolutely delivers in accordance with that tradition. Mr. Hitchcock would be proud if he saw this movie. If you liked The Birds you will probably like The Happening. It makes you twitch, wince, and jump - all earmarks of a good scary movie.

The most common error I see among those who dislike Night's recent films, is that they compare them to The Sixth Sense and Signs (two very different movies by the way). I think Night has decided to do what he wants to do. He is an artist. If his career is ended, at least no one can accuse him of playing it safe.  My guess is that people who frequently criticize Night movies are about as deep as a shallow bath tub. His movies go right over their heads. They prefer popcorn flicks where there is nothing to contemplate, and always a pretty ending. They probably thought the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie was good!

Shyamalan is not without his flaws. By no means do I see his films as perfect. But they are in a different league than most Hollywood drivel. The fact that he is largely unappreciated makes me like him even more. Bravo Mr. Shyamalan! Thanks for not allowing me to lose all faith in all Hollywood movies. There is still some creativity out there that doesn't include tons of CGI. I can't wait for your next film!",1219622400,17,1751,4.428571428571429
1995625,4,6300248291,"We have two groups of people. Those who look at a movie from an artistic point of view, who see a movie not only for it's entertainment value but deeper than that; people who see cinematic beauty in the storytelling, camera shots, music, lighting, etc. And then, we have the people who see movies purely for their entertainment value . . which, lets face it, in todays world, that's what movies are all about to people. But if you find yourself falling comfortably into the first category of the semi-artistic people who look beyond the pure entertainment, then the Happening is actually a decent movie. Yes, I have to agree with the lot and say that this is not M. Night's best work, in fact it's probably the lowest of all his movies in my opinion, BUT that's not to say its bad. Everyone is expecting M. Night to shock us like he did in the 6th Sense, and unfortunately that is working against him because that's where people have set the bar for him, but M. Night is showing versatility in every movie he does. He is known for his masterful storytelling, and with the Happening, he didn't stray from that ability. Let's forget about the ending and how everyone was expecting a twist, a shocker, and focus on the movie as a whole, it's message, and the beauty that's found within the cinematography, haunting music, and story. For me, M. Night has done it again. So which category are you in? Are you going to appreciate this haunting, chilling, and beautifully shot film?

1995629,2,6300248291,"You know M. Night Shyamalan and his films. I think someone has already summarized the career of this once brilliant director so far, so I only add that he made great films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and I still love them. Will he ever going to ""come back"" and make a great film again? His latest film strongly suggests that this is not happening.

""The Happening"" is a supernatural thriller that opens in Central Park, New York City. People suddenly start to act strangely and they eventually die in a bizarre way. I don't reveal here how it happens in this R-rated film, but I can say what you will see in the construction site scene is bizarre and eerie, something that reminds us of the director's earlier films. ""The Happening"" certainly starts promisingly.

But about 30 or 40 minutes in, it stalls. The story centers on a Philadelphia science teacher played by Mark Wahlberg and his wife Zooey Deschanel. They try to escape to the countryside using a train with his best friend and math teacher played by John Leguizamo and his daughter, but things would not go as planned, as we expected, and they are stranded in a small town where horrifying news arrive. This is where the film stops being interesting. Things happen in a rather haphazard way; characters remain uninteresting or just outrageous, like a Miss Havisham-like old lady, this film's counterpart of Tim Robbins in ""War of the Worlds."" Bad acting from the leading players does not help.

But who is really to blame for the incredibly weak and incoherent storyline? Apparently co-producer/writer/director M. Night Shyamalan borrowed sci-fi thriller elements from such masterpieces as ""The Birds."" Borrowing itself is not a bad thing, I know; what makes ""The Happening"" really bad is the way it borrows. Just because ""The Birds"" does not show the true reasons for birds' violent attacks on humans doesn't mean that you can leave the crucial part of the film's plot unexplained AFTER giving us so many hints and clues. Why does IT start in the park? Why does it happen only in the certain area of the United States? The film changes rules more than once as if trying to cover the facts that it actually has no coherent logic behind the random deaths of the people.

Mr. Shyamalan did one good thing in ""The Happening,"" though: he stopped acting, restricting his role to a much smaller one, a voice on a cell phone. At least he listened. I sincerely hope he listens again.",1217116800,3,2432,4.72877358490566

In walks the Vice Principal.  Class is dismissed.  It seems that everywhere people are being struck with some kind of condition where they are disoriented and kill themselves.

Elliot and his best friend Julian (Spencer Breslin) have a few moments of guessing what's happening.  Then, the flight begins.  The problem is, there really is no place to run on the Eastern Seaboard.  Elliot and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) end up with custody of Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) when Julian leaves to find his wife who's taken an alternate route from the city.

The question is--will the three survive?  For that matter, will Elliot and Alma even be able to hang together through this?

What I was hoping for was an interesting bunch of suppositions and maybe even a solution from our science and math teachers.  Unfortunately, I didn't get it.  What I got instead was a series of successively bloody and gory suicides with no real answer.  The science and math guys really just didn't 'pay off' in this plot.

By the end of the film, both my companion and I agreed ""The Happening"" just wasn't happening for either of us.  One good aspect--the eerily beautiful soundtrack by music master James Newton Howard.  That was a highlight.

Nothing happens. There's no climax or good performances or suspense or monsters or fiends or even a twist ending.
I sat through this truly disastrous movie and I couldn't find one saving grace. The trailers led you to believe this would be a sci-fi movie.
And I'll have to admit, the first ten minutes start out promisingly: when people start killing themselves and talking babble. But then it stops. We're introduced to an embarassingl miscast Mark Walhberg portraying a science teacher. He talks about the dissapearance of bees. Could this be a clue as to what's happening in NYC--where people are killing themselves?

Then we get the idea that maybe it has something to do with the wind. We see endless shots of wind stirring plants and leaves. and then we think: it must be the plants. But there's nothing remotely scary here either. We see shots of ordinary plants stirring in the wind. We see tree limbs moving around. We see Walhberg and his wife and friends running into houses to escape the wind.

In one big moment, when the wind is approaching the group, Wahlberg turns to the camera for a big close-up as he hollars: ""Just a minute--I'm trying to figure this out.""

That's when the few people in the theater where I saw this all cracked up. He was saying exactly what all of us were thinking. ""I'm trying to figure out what the heck is going on in this movie.""

And then we suddenly see Walhberg and his wife and child living happily in NYC again and the streets are filled with traffic and people are all moving around again. What happened? Where did all the NYC corpses go? Why isn't the wind still killing everyone. Why was NYC and a few other places the only areas of the USA to have a killer wind/plants?

There's no excitement or tension or suspense as we see people running from the wind. Nor are we given reasons why the wind/plants told people to kill themselves.

This would make a terrific double-bill with that horror classic, HANDS OF MANOS that was so lovingly presented to us on the Mystery Science Fiction series. Both movies are so very bad but at least MANOS, in its own, cheap, demented way, tried to be sincere.

I wonder what the twist ending will be? That guy is making ANOTHER suspense thriller!?! I wonder if he'll finally top ""The Sixth Sense?"" On and on people complain before they've even SEEN THE STINKING MOVIE!!! Guys, just chill. Buy a popcorn, and watch ""The Happening"" without any expectations or premonitions. You just might be surprised. ""The Happening"" opens with Mark Wahlberg quizzing his class about the disappearance of millions of honey bees. This is an important topic of course because the Earth needs honey bees to survive. Chances are if you are into reading about the planet, you'll have stumbled upon this very real problem.

Shortly after that though it's reported that groups of people are acting strange. First they start talking gibberish. Then they walk backwards. To cap it all off they kill themselves. Sometimes in very violent and bloody fashion (which is likely the reason behind Shyamalan's first R rating). Can this event be explained? Maybe. Wahlberg's character has a theory that the plants are releasing chemicals to the wind, and that the wind is causing the chemicals to effect everything else. Is this a credible theory? Maybe not. Certainly most of the characters don't agree. I'm not even sure if I agree. Another person suggests that this event could just be one of natures unexplained events. And there is the brilliance of this film. Instead of giving the audience a direct answer, Shyamalan simply shows us a terrible event and lets us decide for ourselves what it means.

Is the event a warning? Is there any logic behind it? A freak accident? Or is it just something that happened one day? The answer may be in the question, the title, or none of the above. ""The Happening"" seems more interested in asking questions then it does giving answers to odd questions. A rarity from Shyamalan to be sure, but the loss of honey bees hits close to home, and I get the feeling Shyamalan made this film as a way to soul search. This movie strikes me as being concerned about the environment, and the event that happens just can't be logically explained or proven. We can have our suspicions, but ultimately they are just that. This movie breaks many of the rules Shyamalan has set up in his past films, and for that he gets an A.

That said, is this Shyamalan's best movie? No. Is it ONE of his best?! Well, considering the man has made a mere six films, and if I were to select the top three, then no, this is not one of them. What this movie is is scary. And suspenseful. And if nothing else, it's got some of the most eerie images he's filmed in years. And if that isn't worth a recommendation then I must seriously do a soul search and discover what is.

""The Happening"" is a somewhat successful thriller.  The success lies in the genuine creepiness that pervades the film.  The methodical suicides that are shown in R rated detail are disturbing.  They are shocking and powerful.  The problem here is that the story has nowhere to go.  Any explanation is going to feel like a letdown (and it is).  The best film I can compare ""The Happening"" to is ""The Birds"".  Creepy, but ultimately unsatisfying.

Still, if you screened this film to an audience without telling them it's a Shyamalan film, there's a 62% chance every one of them would hate it (hey, if a character in the movie can give something a 62% probability of happening or not happening without any evidence whatsoever at his disposal, I can do the same thing - in fact, I am going to start using the word Shyamalan as a verb meaning to fudge numbers in a vain attempt to make yourself look smart).

So what happens in The Happening?  Not a whole heck of a lot.  New York City finds itself the epicenter of a terrifying and mysterious attack by a biological or chemical agent that makes everyone it comes in contact with kill himself or herself.  The squeamish should not be concerned in the slightest, as people somehow manage to cut their own jugular veins, jump off of tall buildings, and even shoot themselves in the head without actually bleeding.  You would think mass suicide on such an unprecedented scale would leave the big cities swimming in blood and gore, but no - all Shyamalan gives us is a bunch of dummies strewn about the landscape.  When others talk about how frightening some of the scenes are, I have to wonder if we actually watched the same movie.  I guess a couple of scenes might prove disturbing to young children, but I see no reason for this film receiving an R rather than a PG-13 rating.

Mark Wahlberg plays a New York City biology teacher who joins the masses of people calmly evacuating the city (yep, millions of New Yorkers flee town without even a single incidence of pushing and shoving) with his wife, a buddy, and that buddy's little girl.  Elliott (Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) make for an odd couple.  I don't know what was up with Alma, but half the time it seemed like she and Elliott had just met.  John Leguizamo plays Elliott's buddy, but Leguizamo is totally wasted on the part.  Anyway, Elliott and his crew end up on the run, trying to find the most isolated of areas to hide out in (by this point, Elliott has a hunch or two as to what is actually going on).

I guess the ""big twist"" this time around is the lack of a big twist.  Shyamalan should really consider hiring someone to write his endings for him, as the ending of The Happening just sort of lays there like a dead fish - a smelly dead fish.  The end result is a movie that only Al Gore could love (for reasons that will become clear if you see the film) - even though I half suspect that even he would find it boring in places.  The best thing I can say about The Happening is that it's not quite as bad as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition)</a>.",1214611200,7,3574,5.2368421052631575

1995642,5,6300248291,"In another review I wrote, someone called me ""sanctimonious"". I can only guess why, but instead of apparently insulting people in my last review, I'll post a strictly technical review of The Happening.

I liked The Happening for the following reasons:

1. It was a 90 minute paranoia movie similar in style and structure to Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

2. Rather than showing special effects CGI style, it followed a group of people and simply showed them trying to survive the event.

3. It had scenes that were touching - the mother in the field talking to her daughter on her cell phone, in which the daughter is infected, was a sad and emotional scene.

4. The suicide scenes were filmed in a unique and original way.

5. The score was atmospheric and dark - exactly what the story needed.

6. The scene with Mrs. Jones was absolutely chilling.

7. The fact that Shyamalan did not reveal anything and left it open to your own interpretation, regarding the event.

8. The whole movie was very efficient - it starts up instantly, and moves from scene to scene - as though it was a lesson in filmmaking, how to storyboard a movie - the movie simply did not repeat itself - it kept gaining ground.

9. The humour - ""packing hot dogs for the road"" - it's silly, but it's effective in disrupting the suspense. Similar to Shyamalan's masterpiece ""Signs"", which was brilliant in juxtaposing suspense with humor also.

10. The scene with the wind is absolutely refreshing to watch in a day and age of CGI effects - it's something that harks back to The Twilight Zone or Outer Limits days - I absolutely enjoyed this aspect of the film.

Now, with all this said, I still feel that Signs is Shyamalan's masterpiece because it juxtaposes an invasion with humor, suspense, a brilliant Mel Gibson performance, and some of the spookiest scenes in cinema history (i.e. the Brazilian alien spotting and the alien leg in the cornfield, but The Happening is a great movie in its own right.",1214524800,7,1978,4.636103151862464

After a rash of apparent suicides, the government believes New York is under attack by terrorists. Enter School Science Teacher played by Mark Wahlberg. He and his family and friends flee the city, hoping to escape. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any escape from the biological weapon which kills without warning.

I knew the film was going to be bad the moment the one girl removed a long hair stick and impaled herself with it. I thought to myself, please tell me this is not going to be a guts and gore film. Unfortunately, it does appear to be the case. Gore won out over the big mystery of 'what was happening' to the citizens, and from there, it just sort of escalated. The mystery was lost, as we are treated to about a dozen senseless suicides, which were meant to underscore the seriousness of the biological weapon, but instead gave the film a really silly slasher quality.

Mark's character Elliot and John Leguizamo's character were about the only characters I cared about. I could not stand Zooey Deschanel's acting and her droopy character, and Julian's kid just added nothing to the screenplay, except a tagalong and an excuse for Elliot and Alma to not get the heck out of Dodge as quickly as possible.

Overall, I was disappointed in this film. I am accustomed to rather clever films from Shyamalan, and this film just seemed to lack direction, and be rather obvious. The limp half-hearted explanation of events at the end of the film was just silly, as was the forced romance between Elliot and Alma who had little chemistry.

Technically speaking, I found The Happening an excellent film. The script was good, the acting was excellent and the each character had a very unique personality. Despite the fact that there is little to no lead up to the crisis, Shyamalan skillfully lets us know what has been going on before the opening credits through dialogue.

Also, though Shyamalan by no means pushes the max of the R rating, it does allow him to show things that PG-13 wouldn't allow, which, in my opinion, improved the overall quality of the film. At no point during the movie did I feel that Shyamalan was using the blood and violence as an exclusive way to scare the viewer. Instead, it works hand-in-hand with the story and work-up to create a more eery atmosphere. A success in my mind.

Yet as I left the theater, I questioned whether I liked the film. Mostly, the enviromentalist plot is always a deterent, as everyone seems to be jumping on the global-warming-crisis-film bandwagon. (The Day AFter Tommorow! AHHHH!)

But from where I stand now, I enjoyed the film. Because, as I thought back, the eco-thing was really used as plot device, rather than an agenda. I never felt that the director was pushing a propoganda piece in front of us. It was a film, with a very original villain that drew from an issue of the times.

That said, I would reccomend the film. Everyone will make something different of it, as indicated by the wide variety of responses written in reviews. Nevertheless, with a master like M. Night Shyamalan, you very well may find it to be worth your time.",1214265600,2,1741,4.621359223300971
1995647,1,6300248291,"I really don't know where to start with this movie. It was just an all-around failure.

THE ACTING
John Leguizamo was the only one in the whole film who put in a good performance (Wahlberg's best friend in the movie). Wahlberg's and Zooey Deschanel's (his wife in the movie) characters both came across as cheesy and stupid, but then again neither of them even looked like they were trying. All of the secondary characters (and I mean all of them) were boring. Instead of trying to follow the film (it wasn't hard, the plot was equally as shallow as the acting) I kept waiting for the death scenes so the secondary people would all get killed off.

THE PLOT
Basically, plants fight back against humanity because we pollute the environment... yeah. I'm not making this up.

If you can handle watching hundreds of different species of plants working together as one to release a single chemical that causes humans to kill themselves (I can't help but laugh at that, even now) then this is the movie for YOU. The funniest part is how the writers tried to keep us viewers in suspense. I had the plot figured out in the first 5 minutes. Not to mention there's nothing even remotely frightening about an oak tree, or a bush, or grass. Oh, the terror!

THE DIALOGUE
Maybe the dumbest part of the movie. The whole dialogue, along with the horrendous acting, just came across as laughable. I was sitting in the theater with my hand over my mouth so I didn't burst out in a fit of giggles. Wahlberg talked to his wife like he barely knew her.

Overall, this movie was just plain bad. The ""scary"" parts weren't scary. The ""feel-good"" parts made me roll my eyes. The ""tragic"" parts weren't tragic. The ""suspenseful"" parts were a joke. The suicides weren't realistic (the best one was a police officer shooting himself in the head with a 9mm. When the body rolls into view we see the wound, and it's this little pin-prick hole in the front of his head dribbling a couple drops of blood), and all the people were stupid. Leguizamo's character just up and leaves his daughter to go look for his wife in New Jersey after pulling some statistics out of his hat (""there's a 62% chance it hasn't been hit yet"").

My advice: If you MUST see this movie, rent it. Don't bother spending money on a ticket.",1214179200,10,2282,4.526699029126213
1995648,3,6300248291,"I must state up front that I am a big M. Night Shyamalan fan. I'm especially partial to both Signs and The Village, which in my mind are pure genius. Every time one of his films is released I'm always amazed at the slaughter that ensues from both fans and critics alike. Make no mistake about, people love to hate this guy and I just don't get it. I believe that Shyamalan is one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time and I'm always anxiously awaiting his next offering.

As I read early reviews on The Happening, I was actually very hopeful because they were so negative. Everyone told me to avoid Lady in the Water and I really enjoyed it. Surely it was going to be the same with Shyamalan's latest right? I was going to discover once again that for some reason I'm one of the only film buffs on the planet that can truly recognize good filmmaking when I see it. As much as it pains me, I must concede that for once everybody else was right. I wanted to love this movie. I wanted to find greatness where no one else could, but it bums me to admit that it's nowhere to be found.

It seems that the story and more specifically, the antagonists bothered most critics and reviewers. I actually thought the story was interesting and I could even buy the bizarre explanation for what was happening. However, I really feel like for the first time that Shyamalan really missed the mark with his plot execution. The movie starts out on the right notes, sucking us into the story with chilling sequences and clever suspense. Unfortunately, the film peaks early and leaves us with very little to pull the story along.

Mark Whalberg's performance was especially disappointing. He tried way too hard to make his character seem soft-spoken and damaged. Instead, all he did was give us a character that was incredibly annoying and whiny throughout the film. Zooey Deschanel only proved what she's proven in all of her other films: she's a weird chick and can only play weird chicks in movies. The rest of the cast was just OK at best, and this is the first Shyamalan film where I felt the casting was done poorly. I dare say the film would have been better off casting the other Whalberg brother and the other Deschanel sister.

The Happening is Shyamalan's first Rated R film and it's very obvious. It reminded me of what happened when George Lucas finally got his hands on CGI for Star Wars Episodes I-III. The films looked spectacular, but somewhere along the way Lucas forgot what made the original trilogy so timeless: the story! The Happening showcases some of Shyamalan's most frightening scenes to date and he makes good use of the R rating. Unfortunately, it seems he was so focused on making parts of this film as scary as he could that he neglected the all-important plot.

I haven't given up hope on M. Night Shyamalan and I do believe he will wow us again. Sadly, it won't be with this sub-par effort.",1214179200,2,2910,4.524714828897339
1995649,3,6300248291,"Saw this one in the theater in Charleston, SC.  It was pretty good, but not great.  I enjoyed it once, but would probably not watch it a second time.

It begins in Central Park, Manhattan, New York, where 2 girls are on a park bench reading and talking.  A strange breeze comes out of nowhere, people are frozen still in their tracks.  One of the girls on the bench pulls her hairpin out of her head and stabs herself in the neck.  Yuk.

Next scene is 3 blocks from the park on a construction site.  People start jumping from the tops of buildings.  Splat.  Splat.  Splat.  Another one bites the dust, like the song goes.

Next, we go to Philadelphia, where Mark Whalberg/Elliot is a school teacher.  He is discussing what might make people kill themselves in NYC, asking the teens for their possible theories.  The news media is talking about possible terrorist activities in releasing airborn toxins around the park.  NYC has just been evacuated and schools are now closing in Philadelphia.  The teachers at Elliot's school are told to send the students home.  School is being closed.  Now the news media is saying this is a neurotoxin that makes you kill yourself.  Elliot and his wife/Emma pack to take the train out of Philadelphia out to the country.  They are going with a friend and his 8-year old daughter Jess.  The friend's wife/Yvette hops a bus to Princeton, NJ (I think she waited too long to get the train or something). The same thing begins to happen in a park in Philadelphia.  Everybody on the train begins to talk about what's happening as the train chugs along out into the country.  Finally, the train stops in a little no-name town deep in the PA suburbs and they make evrybody get off.  It seems the train crew has lost contact with everyone, so they just stopped.  The radio is now saying it is happening up and down the whole Northeast.  The people from the train start panicking and Jess' dad gets a ride with some people to go to Princeton to look for Yvette, and sends Jess with Elliott and Emma.  As dad and the car arrive in Princeton, they see dead people everywhere.  Meanwhile, Elliott, Emma and Jess take off in another direction with some other people.  There seems to be something in the air and when the wind blows, it blows this ""something"" on you.  Then you flip out and kill yourself, robotic-like. Nature's way of getting even, or protecting itself against humans?

It's scary and suspenseful.  I enjoyed watching it once, but not more than once.  I had to look away a couple of times when people were doing themselves in, but it wasn't too bad.  I do NOT recommend this for children.  Could give them nasty nightmares.

Now thinking back over the film, I realize that the hypothetical ""happening"" makes sense. It all boils down to humanity's affect on mother nature. Why couldn't plants evolve to defend themselves? Plants do communicate, and there were cited examples of that in the film. Evolution is a part of life for all living things, and even though this film is a little far fetched, it's somewhat believeable, and that makes it kind of scary. And now that I think about it, the whole bee thing in the beginning of the movie makes me wonder if that was supposed to be viewed as the catalyst for why ""the happening"" began when it did. It's an interesting idea. I would probably see this movie again. If you don't like thinking too much about your entertainment, go see it anyway because there are still plenty of comedic moments to laugh at and shocking deaths to gasp about to make it worth your while.

All of his other films do (however I wouldn't know about the three films he directed before SIXTH SENSE), even the horrible LADY IN THE WATER, which this movie was only slightly better than.

I went into the film (already knowing what it was about) expecting it to be another Hollywood propaganda piece about man-made global warming.  I was pleasantly surprised (it was the only way in which this film pleasantly surprised me) to see that that particular theme was comparatively downplayed.  Though the movie does implore everyone to be more tree-hugging, it wasn't so much of...let's just say it wasn't an Inconvenient Ruse.  And I wish there were other good things I could say about this film.

In previous films, MKS directs and uses camera shots like Alfred Hitchcock and other famous directors who could tell a story without dialogue or special effects or anything of that sort.  They simply showed you the character and directed the character to act in such a way that the audience was engrossed with that character as well as the story itself.  Take, for example, Bruce Willis in UNBREAKABLE: he doesn't have a whole lot of lines in the film, and yet he is the main character.  But you can tell what he's thinking and what he's feeling even when there's no dialogue.  You could do the same with Haley Joel Osment in SIXTH SENSE.

All that to say, why isn't Shyamalan doing this anymore?  THE HAPPENING is filled with plot holes, horrible acting, silly lines, flaky characters, and unrealistic character scenarios.

The premise of the film, about the Earth's vegetation putting out a toxic chemical to kill humans as a defense against man's abuses on the planet, is actually good. However, it has one glaring plot hole: How can the chemical cause a man or woman to kill themselves? This is the one hole that undermines the movie.
However, the character story is terrific, and the acting is great. Mark Wahlberg leads a terrific cast in this film, and the character development side of the film is handled well.

This film delivers an intensely eerie image of the would-be future and does its best to scare you from your seat with spine chills that stay with you after the movie has ended and haunt you well into the next day.

I would say, that this film, is easily a step in a new direction for Night, and all his detractors are like the fanatics that pursue Michael Moore; some people will never be satisfied no matter what happens. I wouldn't listen to the negative reviews on this film, as it's not intended to be something for mass audiences or kids going out on a date movie. I will say that you can bet that this will sell very well when released on DVD in the future, and will be watched for a long time to come.

""What's happening?!""

""An event!""

""An event is happening?""

""Yes!""

""What kind of event?""

""It's called The Happening, and in it things ... happen. And the word 'happening' is repeated a lot. Also, 'event.'""

""What is this event that happened, The Happening, and why did it happen?""

""It happened to happen when it was happening for reasons we cannot understand, but perhaps because it was about an event that happened, a happening event, caused by nature. Events. Happening. Nature.""

And so goes The Happening, which is the worst movie I've seen in years. Decades, actually. In contrast, the terrible remakes of The Wicker Man and Planet of the Apes seem like high art. But calling The Happening ""terrible"" or ""horrible"" does not do justice to the experience. In watching it, I felt like a voyeur peering into the mind of a filmmaker who had once -- a long, long time ago, it seems -- made a masterpiece, but now, sadly, couldn't even tell a story. It was, by turns, tragic, and embarrassing. Indeed, I started to feel guilty as I laughed out loud, as if the jokes were at the expense of a once talented artist who had lost his gift. I wanted to turn off the projector for his sake. For the M. Night Shyamalan who had inspired me to be a writer.",1213660800,16,1274,4.577092511013216
1995662,3,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan broke out of the gate several years ago with a great suspense film and blockbuster hit, ""The Sixth Sense"".  Now returning, after a string of movies with lukewarm reviews from both fans and critics, the director offers us a film with a thought provoking and interesting concept though not, perhaps, very original....the idea of nature striking back at a consistently irreverant mankind.  The problem is that this movie, unfortunately, doesn't deliver on the potential of a really good idea.

  The story revolves around Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) a high school teacher and his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), who along with others on the northeastern seaboard of the U. S. become trapped in a horrifying biological event.  Starting in New York City's crowded Central Park, people suddenly fall prey to an ""illness"" that, after disorientation leads to the victims fatally wounding themselves.  With their friend, Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter, Jess, the four board a train to leave the area only to find themselves stranded in the danger zone.  What follows is the group (and others) trying to find a way to survive until they can reach the border of the event-free area.

  Shyamalan does deliver some chilling moments in this film.  The death scenes are particularly eerie---the suicide jumpers falling off the buildings in New York and the man at the zoo in the cage with the lions, for example. Betty Buckley also offers a thoroughly creepy character with some spooky scenes late in the film. The director doesn't have to be overly gory to make the hair stand up on the back of our necks but the film does need a consistent flow to the building suspense that he supplies with vigor during the first half of the movie.

  It is the acting and the execution of the concept that offer the biggest problems.  I'm not very familiar with Zooey Deschanel but I found her performance competely lacking and her character, annoying and unlikable.  Wahlberg did a fair job with his character, although I think he can be more charasmatic and entertaining than his portayal in this movie. I think the whole subplot of the young couple's minor marital problems was completely unnecessary and Shyamalan could have worked harder on better dialogue.  The biggest problem, however, is the follow through.  ""The Happening"" has a great first half...the building horror and dread of the unknown is a powerful trigger for the viewers.  But the final half of the film doesn't render a satisfying climax to appease the fans and leave us spellbound and shaken.  I think its unfair for fans and critics alike to expect Shyamalan to toss a mind-bending twist at the end of each film.  I do expect, though, for this director (in whom I still have faith) to reward his dedicated fans with a story (and actors) that are worthy of such a terrifying biological phenomenon.  I do like the pro-evironmental message of the film.  Like the movie or hate it, the subtext of caring for our planet is one that will do all of us some good.

  So, I give the film 3 stars.  A great concept, a really good first half (minus the dreadful acting of Deschanel) but lacking in maintaining the suspense, good dialogue and better acting needed to make the film a complete success.  Recommended for a matinee viewing or perhaps give it a shot once it is released on dvd.",1213660800,2,3347,4.81260945709282
1995663,3,6300248291,"Before i get to the review, allow me some observations about the director's career.  M Night Shyamalan has somehow found himself among the most unfairly criticized of modern filmmakers in spite of the fact that every one of his films are among the most unique, atmospheric, and imaginative out there.  Like Tarantino, it has become fashionable among the too-cool-for-the-room set to bash everything the man does even as they wait in line on opening day for each of his films.  You won't see me tripping over myself to check out the latest Paul Anderson or Uwe Boll joint.  Why continue to follow the career of a hack?  Even the usually even-headed Trey Parker and Matt Stone are guilty of Shyamalan bashing.  The most popular criticism is that his films rely solely on twists.  The truth is that only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;had a profound twist and most will agree that the film was already compelling up to that point.  Yet both film and director have been branded regardless.  Each film he has made has been nearly unclassifiable and very different from what would be expected of any film genre.  This is called creativity, folks.  It's a shame that people can't be comfortable without having each and every preconception and cliche met.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>&nbsp;-while essentially a film about childhood- was really a feature-length taunting of his critics.  Childish?  That was the point.  As a fan of the director's work I really enjoyed that.  Small wonder the reviews were bad; most viewers either didn't understand what they were watching or they were the ones being insulted.  Okay, rant over.  On to M Night Shyamalan's latest.

""The Happening"" was a great concept.  Mark Wahlburg plays our protagonist, a hip science teacher who we meet lecturing his students about Einstein's theory that if bees vanished off of the face of the Earth, mankind would die out shortly after.  Right away we are reminded of humanity's susceptibility to nature and inability to fully comprehend it's workings.  Then it ""Happens"".  By now you all know that ""it"" is a wave of mass suicide; one that begins sweeping across New England with frightening speed.  The resulting carnage will leave horror fans drooling for more.  Wahlburg's character gathers up his wife and his best friend (played by a brilliant John Leguizamo) with daughter and flees New York along with the rest of the surviving populace.  Great filmmaking.

The deaths in ""The Happening"" are the main draw.  In spite of the advertisements' focus on the fact that this is Shyamalan's first R-rated feature, the director uses impeccable restraint in portraying the violent suicides and keeps the profanity nearly nonexistent.  The killshots are suspensful and teasing, showing enough to shock and disturb you, but never lingering enough to become gruesome.  My favorite suicide involves a man at the zoo entering the lion's cage.  The scene is shown as footage from a handheld camera and the result is jarring and unclear, but certainly violent and gory.  The concept, as always, is a brilliant one; nature evolving to strike back at mankind is truly good stuff.  The first half of this film is outstanding.  Unfortunately, it overstays it's welcome.

Now the bad.  Leguizamo is the only worthwhile performance and he is grossly underused.  Wahlburg and his onscreen wife Zooey Deschanel have zero chemistry (though she does have beautiful eyes) and there are more than a few moments where you wonder if the comedic acting is intentional or not.  And the menacing shots of trees are anything but menacing.  Sorry, there is just no way to make a tree shaking in the wind scary unto itself.  And the gimmick of having the victims walk a few steps backwards before offing themselves strikes me as more than a little bit silly.  The stopping dead in their tracks and saying bizarre things was all well and good, but why would they walk backwards?  So goofy.  In spite of the movie's plodding pace, many of the film's concepts are very poorly fleshed-out.  Watching Wahlburg's character put the pieces together is great until Shyamalan apparently decides to throw them out the window for the sake of being mysterious or some such thing.  More could have been done with the mood ring, which comes off as a gimmick to give the characters something to talk about while a whole lot of nothing happens.  Human energy and moods are talked about but never properly integrated into the story's events like they should have been.  Sloppy.  Very sloppy.

I hate to become one of Shyamalan's critics, but this was a poorly put together story that would have made an amazing episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-Horror/dp/B000RIWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of Horror</a>, but just was not ready to be a feature length film.  The first half was jaw-dropping at times and extremely promising, but the characters quickly become tiresome and eventually you're left just waiting for the next death scene.  This script needed some serious work and Shyamlan's filmmaking talents could not fully vindicate his poor writing this time around.  But in spite of it's laundry list of shortcomings, ""The Happening"" has some very worthwhile concepts and deaths that make it worth a peek.  Consider this least of m Night Shyamalan's flicks a tentative rental.  Pass if you're not a fan of his work.  Who am I kidding?  Most of those guys ran out and saw it before I did.  2 1/2 stars rounded up for a strong first half.",1213660800,3,5779,5.29010989010989
1995664,3,6300248291,"That's how I view The Happening. For the first 80% of this thing, you're thinking to yourself, ""This is good. This is what I wanted, what I paid money for."" The suspense is there, the flow is there, the excitement is there, as are all the signals, and just about the time you lean over to give her an innocent goodnight peck on the cheek, she turns her face from you, pushes you away, and exclaims, ""What are you thinking?"" slamming the door in your face and you're left baffled and embarrassed on her front porch.

That's how I would best try to communicate my feelings on M. Night Shyamalan's newest suspense film, a film that at times seems like one for the ages but ultimately leaves you craving more as you suffer mildly from movie-going blue-ball on your long walk over spilled popcorn back up the aisle.

I deeply enjoyed the film's avant-garde twist on just what is causing the hysteria throughout the northeast (you won't get a spoiler from me as the plot has already been spoiled about a dozen times alone here on Amazon), but the new take on an old theme (apocalyptic setting) wasn't enough to make me want to revisit this film the same way I have done with most of M. Night Shyamalan's other work.

It gets a passing grade, but it won't be making the dean's list for films you'll likely want to watch again.",1213574400,2,1319,4.4421487603305785
1995665,4,6300248291,"Act of God- A direct and sudden event or action of certain unexplainable forces that could not be reasonably foreseen; it compromises all evidence and defies all attempts at explanation by Science.

THE HAPPENING is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's latest outing after his somewhat disappointing ""Lady in the Water"". This director's films are lyrical in tone but often has a darkness in their proceedings; Shyamalan`s films are also thematic in their execution and ""The Happening"" is no different. Pronounced as his first ""R-Rated"" film, this latest offering is as imaginative as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". His films are a ""hit"" or a ""miss"", I'm not a solid fan but his films are certainly original. Certain viewers will probably feel a bit alienated because of its main premise, but no one can deny that the film does explore humanity`s greatest threat: the unknown and the unexplainable.

One morning, in a major city in the U.S., everyone seems to be minding their own business, doing their chores, working their shifts, until suddenly, a barrage of unexplainable suicides happen one after the other. Citizens commit violence against themselves and the only explanation the media can offer is a terrorist attack or a deadly toxin released by either terrorists and then plants. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher who bases most things on deductive reasoning and logical explanations; has to flee the city for the countryside with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) together with a small group of survivors to try to escape the invisible threat. However, what they come across with may defy all semblances of logical human explanation.

Shyamalan may have summoned the bleakest array of disturbing images in the film's beginning. The nightmare and mayhem by eventual suicides are thoroughly visible; hairpins are driven to jugulars, construction workers jumping off buildings, cops shooting themselves, people crawling under their own lawnmowers, zoo keepers offering themselves as a the main course to lions. The director offers a lot of truly bleak hysteria and will definitely make your skin crawl. The images are full of intense sequences of mass suicide especially in the first act, which is worthy of the price of a movie ticket by itself. It is dark, moody and bleak that will definitely leave some viewers very affected as it dishes out all the lurid details.

The film emulates a very strong feeling of the unknown and further accentuated by the confused media broadcasts which attempt to explain the phenomena. Elliot has his own theories as well as a kindly farmer which he has crossed paths with. There is also a feeling of helplessness as our cast finds themselves fleeing from one path to another, avoiding heavily populated places with large amounts of deaths. Human panic and fear is also explored with a very bleak execution. Some may say that Shyamalan missed some opportunities as the film seems like a rethread of his film, ""Signs"", with a family caught in all the chaos. While this may be so in a way, I do think that ""The Happening"" is a lot more intense with its premise and its ability to unnerve is more omnipresent.

Elliot offers some theories of the `event' as Wahlberg makes his best expressions of being puzzled, flabbergasted and confused. This man has been on a roll lately, I liked him in ""Shooter"" and ""The Departed""; Markie-mark pulls off a very decent performance. His supporting cast isn't so bad either. The dialogue still has the usual ""quippy"" remarks as is reminiscent in Shyamalan's ""Signs"" that are also an acceptable practice to tone down its bleakness somehow and to express different personalities in a certain situation. I liked the nice touches by the director as he shows the blowing wind as a harbinger of doom, as if a mighty hand envelopes the surroundings with an irresistible force. The only fault the film may have is that it seemed to run a little out of gas near the final act, as he somehow exhausts his ideas. Don't get me wrong, it's just that it may be near-impossible to keep up such a powerful start.

It's impossible for me to say anything more without spoiling the film, the film is a cannon of a horror film in its first act. Complemented with a very bleak tone that stays within a lyrical execution and a good soundtrack, with Wahlberg's confused looks, ""The Happening"" is a satisfying diversion. Its main theme of the unknown promises a change of pace and some viewers may argue that it still followed the same formulas. The film may be somewhat hampered with familiar rethreads of a chase film but it`s overshadowed by what its trying to say. If you're familiar with this director's films; you'll know that he has certain motifs and themes, it's not so much with dealing with answers but asking the answers.

The film's climax may disappoint some viewers as the film never does offer any solid answers; which is the whole point. I can just hear them now; so what was the cause? I thought it was quite good for Shyamalan to encourage these questions, but those who like being spoon-fed the details should just stay away. After all, how do you explain an ""ACT OF GOD""?

1995666,3,6300248291,"Yet another M. Night Shyamalan movie where the best advice is to stay inside with the doors and windows shut.

A tasteless, odorless toxin descends on the populace of the Northeast Coast of America, rendering them unable to process stimuli correctly, and which produces the end product of mass suicide. At least they're not killing each other...but the manners of death are new, gruesome, and inventive. Death by involuntarily offering oneself up to lions at the zoo. Death by industrial-strength lawn mower.

Mark Wahlberg - the poor man's Matt Damon - enters into a flight away from the onset of the toxin with his wife, Zooey Deschanel, and the 8-year-old daughter of Mark's best friend, John Leguizamo, (spoiler) who exits early in the movie. Mark discovers that the toxin, air-borne, affects only sizable groups of people, so his flight includes only his family and a couple others. Circumstances whittles even this core group down, and after an epic journey, he, Zooey, and the little girl end up at the remote - and archaic - stone farmhouse of a peculiar old recluse woman, who puts them up reluctantly, and who unnerves Zooey.

This movie struck similar chords as did ""Signs"", and was reinforced by the same sort of eerie music. A pervasive feeling of dread soaks into this movie, but in reality the plot doesn't really go anywhere, and reaches no complete resolution, unlike the better ""Signs"", while resembling it in style.

I liked three of Mr. Shyalaman's movies - The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village - but haven't been impressed by his last couple. I stayed with this movie, hoping for explanation, but it never really got there. Mark Wahlberg played a good part, as did Zooey Deschanel, but as a couple, they weren't totally believable. I can say that I didn't give up on the movie...but it wasn't what I expected.",1213574400,,1833,4.84664536741214
1995667,1,6300248291,"This movie is a complete disappointment. There is no ""twist"" in the plot which would have made it a little interesting, like the previous Shyamalan films.

1995668,3,6300248291,"M. Night Shyamalan has built a directorial career in which he presents his cast as facing some supremely upsetting challenges that most often border on the supernatural or the grotesque. Along the way, his films start strong but too often dissolve into a cinematic mess of illogic. In THE HAPPENING, he seems to be learning his craft but in bits and pieces. Here too, his initial premise is gripping.  The entire north east of the United States is afflicted with a population that is determined to commit suicide on a mass scale.  He presents the first suicide in a seemingly normal setting, the windblown trees in Central Park. Then, the desire to kill oneself spreads from state to state.  There is no precedent for this. Newscasters theorize that terrorists have unleashed a toxic nerve gas.  Others consider the Hand of God at work.  Still others, attribute this wave of suicide to intelligent plant life that now sees humanity as its collective mortal enemy.

Where Shyalaman goes astray--although thankfully in not too many ways--is his attempt to invest what should be a fright movie with a too deep patina of philosophical angst.  If one ignores his too heavy hand at focusing on innumerable scenes of tree leaves whistling in the wind, then one can sit back and enjoy a movie that posits an upsetting of a mindset that demands that we love life, not abort it. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschannel are effective in many scenes with their low key attempt to balance a precarious married life with confronting others who are rapidly coming unglued.  In his most recent films, Wahlberg has gone the hero route.  Here he is an ordinary math teacher who tries to use his ordered way of thinking to make sense of a hugely disordering phenomenon. THE HAPPENING shows only the surface microcosm of a society that reacts in predictable ways.  I shall not reveal the ending that is breathtaking in its inability to find a balance between weirdness and logic.  Still, THE HAPPENING opens the door of illogic to permit the viewer to get a sense of how a society may unravel when the wind blows a bit too hard in your face.",1213488000,,2116,4.73841961852861
1995669,1,6300248291,"This film will truly give the Shyamalan-haters fuel for their fire and just might prove to be the feather that broke the camel's back, as far as the studios are concerned. I know that it has finally exploded my confidence in him as a filmmaker.  As I watched it, the one word that kept coming to mind was ham-handed. The writing, the story, the acting the directing.... heck, even the cinematography... all ham-handed. Nothing seems thought-out in the movie, much less WELL thought-out.

To set the record straight, I think that Shyamalan has done some awe-inspiring work even outside of his classic Sixth Sense. Unbreakable and Signs were movies that, even though there were things that I wish had been a little more polished, I thought were extraordinary movies. The Village didn't impress me as much but at least he was still telling a story about characters that I could care about.

In The Happening, there is almost no attempt to make the audience care about the characters. And in a suspense movie, guess what? If we don't care about the characters, we don't give a crap about what happens to them.

So we get to sit for an hour and a half watching these characters we could care less about try to figure out a mystery that doesn't make any damned sense. When you have to rely on talking heads to make sure that your audience ""gets it"", that is a sure sign that the story has been too weak in itself to make the point you wanted to make and this movie is FULL of ""talking heads"" in television sets.

Really, I wanted to like this movie. I wanted it to be something significant enough to remind me of exactly why I once decided to go see every movie that Shyamalan ever makes. Instead, this had finally given me reason to re-think that position.",1213488000,6,1751,4.5284810126582276

As high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his unhappy wife and colleague flee to the country, it becomes evident the threat is more likely environmental. Nature is fighting back, with plants releasing some kind of toxin to defend themselves against the human industrial onslaught...

M. Night Shyamalan executes on this charming premise with a deliberate eye to the sci-fi B-movie, both in style and theme, with lashings of gore, a cheesy score, and expository dialogue that at times sounds more like a textbook. Sadly, however, it doesn't entirely work. Shyamalan's no fool. He wouldn't make a B-movie without a specific intention. So what's going on here? Is the substance connected to the style? Does Shyamalan want us to go back to the 1950s? Is he trying to tell us that cities are bad? Is he echoing E. F. Schumacher's cry that ""small is beautiful""? Or is this a response to misplaced moral hysteria around 9/11? Falling bodies around 9.00am on a New York Tuesday certainly stir the echoes. Is he saying there are bigger threats to worry about than a few ideologues in planes; that 9/11, though a tragic event for those involved, is ultimately a miniscule blip compared to our disastrous global environmental trajectory? Or is it simply a musing on the fragility of humankind and the paucity of our knowledge? He'd be right on all counts, of course. But his intention is never clear.

As an argument the film isn't very convincing, and as a piece of entertainment it's worse. Shyamalan's core skills as a writer-director seem to have deserted him - there is no suspense, no real drama, no trademark twist, not even any really nice shots (except the chilling iconic beauty of the falling workmen). It offers just a vague kind of discomfort that's regularly undermined by the near-comic suicide scenes. Shyamalan seems creatively paralysed himself. Still, the film's not entirely without merit. Its difference to standard summer fare makes it reasonably engaging for much of its short duration, and the wheels only really fall off when Moore and family let the power of love trump the power of self-preservation with a very convenient outcome.

I think Shyamalan's also a victim of his own success - expectations are incredibly high for anything he does. From a young, first-time writer-director, this might be seen as competent Hollywood fare with an eye to tradition. From Shyamalan, it's well below par. Wahlberg is probably the strongest element here. He's regularly undermined by appalling dialogue, but his earnestness is endearing. Knowing where he's come from, as an actor and a person, to see him playing this kind of character in this kind of movie is nice.",1213488000,26,2899,5.073375262054507
1995671,1,6300248291,"I don't know about you, but seeing dozens of people on the Big Screen graphically and creatively committing suicide is not my idea of having a good time! But before I go any further, I want to strongly advise people who are severely depressed, or currently have issues with suicidal ideation (thinking/fantasies ) NOT to see this movie. The violence portrayed can be summed up in one word - harsh! The Happening is also wildly inappropriate for children and young teens! Consider this warning a Public Service announcement by someone who used to work with people in crisis!

Personally, it's sad to see Director Shyamalan stoop so low. His masterpiece, ""The Sixth Sense,"" is one of the greatest supernatural fantasy films of all time! He obviously likes to work in this genre, and there are plenty of stories written along these lines over the past hundred years to tap into for ideas! But no, he most follow the majority of Hollywood and dumb down his films, too! The Happening will certainly make Director Shyamalan a quick buck, but it will also damage his brand. He's slowing and steadily becoming the ""Roger Coreman"" of schlock film making. I, for one, will certainly think twice before paying my hard earned money to see another one of his films in the future!

The story  is also so preposterous it comes across ultimately as campy. Intelligent plants are so smart they only wipe out people from Maryland to Massachusetts, as a ""warning"" against Mankind's abuse of the environment! The plant kingdom is only defending it's self from our wanton destruction of the environment. But they can't be all that smart if they attack one of our nation's most environmentally friendly regions in the United States! For example, the LARGEST park in the entire United States, outside of Alaska, is in New York State and it's a STATE park, called the Adirondacks. It's even in the State Constitution to remain forever wild! New York City and the surrounding environs,  has some of the cleanest drinking water in the United States. One of the greatest zoos in the entire world, which works tirelessly to save endangered species, and to educate the rest of us is the BRONX Zoo! New York State dismantled its last built  Nuclear Power plant before it was even turned on! So my dear,  Shyamalan, The Schlockmeister, you had your pathetic plant kingdom army attack the wrong part of the country! Duh!

No one is denying that there's an audience for this kind of intense violence and stupidity, but there's a much larger audience for intelligent story making. Hopefully, The Happening will take a drubbing at the box office and teach this formerly bright filmmaker a valuable lesson!

1995672,2,6300248291,"This M. Night Shyamalan fan finds no joy in judging ""The Happening"" to be the director's first bona fide DUD. (Especially since his good films have received a great deal of unfair criticism.)

But a dud it is. To avoid giving anything away, I will illustrate the film's problems by comparing it to another M.N.S work that is, in some ways, quite similar-- ""Signs."" (Which was a really great film, by the way, so if you haven't seen THAT one, spoilers do, in fact, lie ahead.)

Remember that great pivotal scene in ""Signs"" when Graham (Mel Gibson) is talking to Merrill (Joachin Phoenix)? He says to him,

""People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance.""

Then, remember AFTER the film, when you thought back over everything? You thought, ""If Bo hadn't had that weird germ phobia, there wouldn't have been all those glasses of water...and if Morgan hadn't had asthma... and if Merrill hadn't failed at baseball.. and if the mother hadn't died and said those dying words...."" How GREAT that was, and you realized THAT was the point of the film. All the other stuff was window dressing.

Well, imagine if ""Signs"" hadn't had that fascinating theme that made it great. Take all that away, and you are left with... ""The Happening.""

""The Happening"" is what ""Signs"" would have been if it had just been about aliens landing one day and then leaving a few days later.

Doesn't sound so great does it? Well, it's not. To be fair, the film seemed promising until the end, at which point you realized there wasn't any more. At points, there was a great deal of tension, and there were some excellent creepy scenes with Betty Buckley (the mom from ""Eight is Enough"".) I was even on board with the dialog, which, at the beginning, seemed downright odd, but my faith in M.N.S assured me that it was all for a reason. (Besides, much of it was due to Mark Wahlberg, who has this odd delivery style where he always sounds like an earnest 13 year old.) After a while, I felt it started to work, and there were scenes where it did, in fact, work quite well. As far as John Lequizamo goes, the best I can say is he is not in the whole movie. I really did not like him in this role.

Which is just another way this film is very unlike the rest of the M.N.S canon: his casting has always been spot on, and one of his greatest skills has been in making his actors superbly effective. Even his usual magic with child actors is noticeably absent in this film.

So there you go, M.N.S fans. It brings me no joy to bring this news, but there it is. Two stars.",1213401600,10,2784,4.421875
1995673,3,6300248291,"People are killing themselves.  Not out of depression or despair: just randomly killing themselves.  En masse.  It begins in Central Park, and then spreads rapidly throughout the East Coast.  Smaller and smaller groups of people are succumbing to this mysterious infliction.  It's only a matter of time before everyone on the East Coast is killed off...

""The Happening"" has a wonderful premise.  And, I'll be perfectly honest, it creeped me out.  Show me your vampires, your werewolves, your haunted houses--nothing scares me like seeing ten bodies hanging from the trees over a suburban street.  The fact that, at any moment, our self-preservation drive could be shut down, is a rather terrifying prospect that, at first, Shyamalan delves deeply into.  The first half of the movie is tense and thought-provoking...not to mention flat-out terrifying.

But after that...well...it begins to get predictable (even after the director goes out of his way to show us that, yes, he will do whatever he wants).  By the film's end, you're shaking your head, wondering what all the build-up was for.  It's a great start, but a weak ending, and that is what holds the movie back.

As for the performances...they take some time to get used to.  It's hard to see Mark Wahlberg as a nice high school professor; at first, it seems like he's doing a horrible Ryan Reynolds impersonation.  By the films end, however, you respect Wahlberg for restricting himself; I'm pretty sure he doesn't drop the f-bomb once, and that's pretty good for him.  Zooey Deschanel, likewise, seems restrained; it isn't until halfway through the picture that you come to understand why.  John Leguizamo, in his too-small role, is a wonder; the man is a chameleon.

Overall, ""The Happening"" is a stronger film than Shyamalan's last effort, ""Lady in the Water"" (which was almost unbearable at points, despite solid acting from lead Paul Giamatti).  The R-rating is a pleasant surprise; Shyamalan lets you know, within the first five minutes, that he plans on taking full-advantage of the looser restrictions.  It's interesting, actually--yes, there's more gore, but it's still restrained; there's still the trademark Shyamalan minimalism.  However, there isn't that big ""oh my God REALLY?"" moment (which, lets face it, we're expecting); this, in part, leads to the film's lack-luster ending.  It's hard to tell if the pro's outweigh the con's here...I reccommend seeing the film for yourself, before you judge.  It's certainly disturbing; plan on having a couple nightmares.",1213401600,2,2535,5.171990171990172
1995674,2,6300248291,"We all know what started it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>.  Let me clarify, though.  THE SIXTH SENSE was NOT a success because of its third act twist.  Shyamalan's breakthrough film succeeded because he created believable characters dealing with a solid, definable conflict that came to a powerful, relatable conclusion AND THEN he introduced a twist.  And not a cheap, showy, carnival twist, but a twist that ADDED TO (not reversed or mutated) the gut-wrenching emotional climax that preceded it.  Although it got all the press, the twist in THE SIXTH SENSE was simply the icing on the cake of that film.  And as any eight year-old kid who's been to a wedding can tell you, if you only eat the icing, all you get is sick.

Shyamalan has languished ever since, but only because he ended up falling for his own hype.  He tried (and, I believe) set up an equally satisfying emotional bedrock in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unbreakable/dp/B00003CXQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unbreakable</a>, but he expected his twist in that film to BE the resolution, instead of supplementing it.  Bad idea.  A twist is NOT a conclusion.

His characters and his conflict and even his conclusion were more solidly established in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Signs/dp/B00005JL3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Signs</a>, but -- whoops -- he was dead-set on tacking on one of his patented twists, and the story he'd created didn't really need one, so the twist came across as being not just unnecessary, but also ludicrous.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>&nbsp;came closest to reliving the old Shyamalan magic, and that was APART FROM the silly twist.  Here we have a decent story, well-acted and well-established characters, and beautiful cinematography to boot.  But, ruh-roh, here's that twist again, in this case, a twist that doesn't ADD to the climax, but which completely reverses it, casting an unflattering light on all of the characters and events and turning them into frightened, self-deluding caricatures.

Perhaps flailing against what he realized was a fatal adherence to his own fading glory, Shyamalan created&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-in-the-Water/dp/B000JLTR8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady in the Water</a>, the least twist-y of all of his films.  He sets up a mythos, creates a filmic architecture out of a vague fairy tale, and gives us a sleight-of-hand ending that is only about as impressive as your average street side game of Three Card Monte.  Not a bad movie, but certainly forgettable.

And now?  THE HAPPENING.

Something happens, that's for sure.  Suddenly people are freezing in mid-dog walk, they're losing their places in their books, talking nonsense, and next thing you know, they're jabbing themselves with hair pins, jumping from roofs, and hanging themselves with garden hoses.  It's a biological attack!  Terrorists!

The funny thing about THE HAPPENING is that Shyamalan doesn't even bother keeping his cards hidden.  Elliot Moore (a Scooby-Doo-ish Mark Wahlberg), our protagonist, takes a quick Chemistry teacher-esque jab at guessing what's going on, and it's fair enough to say he comes close.  At least close enough to matter.  Because, aside from the actual ""happening,"" there's almost nothing to the movie, other than a small group of people trying to find a place where it ISN'T happening.

And that solid emotional core that made THE SIXTH SENSE such a hit?  Those definable characters?  That relatable sense of suspense and connection?  It's all a joke, here, and I'm not kidding.  In fact, Shyamalan openly mocks the emotional Tootsie center of his film.  When Moore discovers that his wife, Alma (played by a perpetually wide-eyed and vacant Zooey Deschanel), may have been unfaithful (he finds out, I'm just not going to tell you), the moment is used as a source of huckster's levity.  In fact, every instance where character development is pursued is used to either add gags or fake punch (stinging orchestral ""scares"" or the sort of creepy vibes that are normally expected to accompany ambiguous, world-wide catastrophes).

The sad news is that Shyamalan still has not learned to go back to what initially made him such a hit.  In fact, my guess is he's so desperate to reclaim that magic that he made the worst mistake of all.  THE HAPPENING?  The ENTIRE MOVIE is the twist.  And that's all it is.  If you're wondering what that means, then I'll rewrite THE SIXTH SENSE, in the spirit of THE HAPPENING:

Bruce Willis:  ""I WILL save this poor little boy, because I am an award-winning child psychologist.""

Haley Joel Osment:  ""Did you realize you're a ghost?""

Bruce Willis:  ""I'm a ghost?  Nooooooooooooooo!""  (continues screaming ""No!"" for ninety minutes)

1995675,1,6300248291,"This film should get no stars.  I've enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan other movies, yeah they can be a bit off the wall but it kept me entertain and think about the message that I would get out of the film.  Yes this movie has a messeage as well, I mean natural unexplainable occurrences do happen but he should have delivered it in a different way. It's pretty bad when you are walking out the theater and people back of you and in front of you are saying what a dumb movie it was.  So for date night my husband and I decided to watch this movie over the new Indy film.  Since it had an R rated we expected M. Night Shyamalan to deliver a really good scary flick.  At credits we sat there like this is it.  He revealed the reason (I'm not going to give it away) why ""the happening"" was happening way too soon in the film.  The only reason why this film had a R rating is because of blood (mind you some scenes like the zoo scene didn't even look real- you can tell they were fake arms).  Not to mention that my husband and I like Mark Wahlberg (and since we are movie buffs we got a kick out of the idea that Mark's brother Donnie was in The Sixth Sense- kind of like a family affair type of thing), it was just a let down.  I will say that in the first scene it does capture your attention (seeing people freeze and than killing themselves) but at the end it just didn't live up to our expectations. One thing I always liked about M. Night Shyamalan films is there is some kind of twist at the end.  This film does not have that.  We have all of  M. Night Shyamalan on DVD at the moment but when The Happening gets released on DVD we will not buy this one. So disappointed.  If you want to see a good M. Night Shyamalan movie watch The Sixth Sense or Signs.",1213401600,12,1753,4.046376811594203

All you saw from the beginning to the end of the film are this disturbing images of people commiting suicide. The characters are poorly developed, the story was ridicuously absurb and script is full with confusing, silly and preachy lines.",1213401600,40,475,4.459770114942529
1995677,3,6300248291,"Uncanny, the way M. Night Shyamalan can ruin an intriguing concept. Like all his other films, ""The Happening"" meanders in far too many directions and ends on a very disappointing note, but not before enticing us with a promising setup. Picture, if you will, a group of people walking in New York's Central Park: they suddenly stop, begin walking backwards, and finally find some way to commit suicide. One young woman impales her neck with her own hair stick, but not before losing her place in the book she was reading. This is quickly followed by a series of construction workers jumping to their deaths; the camera looks up from street level as a number of men step off the scaffolding, coming at us in slow motion. It's a disturbing couple of scenes, but they sure got my attention. I actually wanted to stay with this story, to see where it would go and what would happen and who would be involved.

We're then introduced to the main characters, beginning with Elliot Moore (Mark Whalberg), a junior high science teacher from Philadelphia. He challenges his students to theorize why there's been a decline in the world's bee population, why their bodies are nowhere to be found. The only answer he accepts is from a fifteen-year-old boy: they disappeared as the result of a natural phenomenon we will probably never understand. This vague explanation plays as a counterpart to an Einstein quote written on the chalkboard: ""If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth, man would have no more than four years to live."" You would think this scene would be the foundation for the main body of the plot, but no--bees are never again mentioned, and that's a shame because it's a genuine world issue, and real issues are always much scarier than fictional events.

Be that as it may, that classroom scene leads to an impromptu faculty meeting, at which point we learn about suspected terrorist activity in New York City. Apparently, some kind of airborne toxin is scrambling everyone's brains, driving them to kill themselves in broad daylight. Soon enough, other Northeastern cities are under attack, and what's worse, it's spreading away from the city parks into less populated country towns. By now, many Philadelphia residents have decided to flee the city via train. Among them are Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), his friend, Julian (John Leguizamo), and his young daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). They never reach their destination; the train stops in a middle of nowhere town, and everyone is asked to get off. When Elliot demands an explanation, the conductor says, ""Sir, we've lost contact."" ""With whom?"" Elliot persists. ""Everyone."" Ominous, yes. And it gets worse at a local diner, when the newscaster on TV makes his report: ""The possibility of this event being a terrorist attack is becoming less and less likely.""

At this point, the characters rely purely on conjecture, and so do we because absolutely none of it is explained. The mystery, oddly enough, was engaging. It would have been a lot more satisfying, however, had Shyamalan not included a couple of subplots that not only add nothing to the story, but also don't work in and of themselves. One involves Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), an isolated old woman so strange and untrusting that it's a wonder Elliot, Alma, and Jess have dinner at her house. She lets them all stay overnight, yet she's convinced that they're either going to steal from her or murder her while she sleeps. She rudely smacks Jess' hand when she reaches for a cookie sitting on the table; Jess sits still, at which point Mrs. Jones willingly hands her one of the cookies. What any of this has to do with the happening, I have no idea.

The other subplot concerns Elliot and Alma, who have apparently been fighting over the most insignificant things. Alma eventually fesses up to a slight indiscretion ... so slight that no committed couple would be so troubled by it. Elliot tries to retaliate by making a very unfunny joke about asking a female pharmacist for cough drops. Either these characters are badly drawn, or Whalberg and Deschanel were horribly miscast. Maybe it's both. It certainly is in Deschanel's case--she gives one of the year's most awkward performances, so awkward that it's unintentionally funny. What does this say about the intentionally funny moments? Not a whole lot, seeing as they were all incredibly inappropriate. Consider this moment with a nursery owner (Frank Collison) when the topic of food comes up: ""Hot dogs get such a bad rap. They have a nice shape. They're protein. You like hot dogs, don't you?"" He then theorizes that the earth's plants are producing the toxin as a means of self-defense, so he makes sure to positively reinforce his garden before leaving.

This may sound like a work of genius to you. It sounds more like rambling nonsense to me, and this is all before the ending. While Shyamalan doesn't cheat with a ridiculous plot twist, he does make the fatal mistake of leaving almost everything unresolved. There's a fine line between an air of mystery and an unfinished film, and sadly, it was crossed. Even with an absorbing idea and a few interesting scenes ""The Happening"" is an aimless oddity, a film that isn't the thriller, the love story, or the social commentary it wanted to be. It is, however, blessedly short--a mere ninety-one minutes--which is a welcome relief from the unreasonably tedious lengths of Shyamalan's previous films. This could be a good sign; if this movie showed improvement in his sense of pacing, then maybe his future films will show improvement in structure and characterization and dialogue and consistency and performance and plausibility and direction in general.",1213315200,3,5708,4.910880829015544
1995678,4,6300248291,"It sounds like many who saw The Happening were looking for a 6th Sense twister ending or Saw level gore fest, and this film is neither.  The arrogance of man in the face of nature and/or nature fighting back is not a new idea. Writers have addressed this over the last 150 years including Stephen Crane, Jack London, Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) and Terry Gilliam (12 Monkeys, which interestingly does have a twist ending and Bruce Willis). As with M. Night's best films, this is a sharply defined character study shaped by events beyond the control of the individuals involved, and this is what gives the film its humanity. The idea that a toxin of some sort is shutting off the self-preservation mechanism in humans leading to their own demise, is not a far-fetched one.  And at every turn, we are treated to media takes on the events, which start with terrorism and end with government cover-up, writing off environmental possibilities entirely, though we have been equally treated to info concerning similar real natural occurrences throughout the film.  Most Americans scientific/medical interest and education doesn't extend much beyond concerns over the download speed of their i-phone or picking up their happy pills from their local Walgreen's.  As a result, most are too ignorant on this level to grasp the potential reality of such an event.  They know and care nothing of the days when microbes swept through entire cities as the common cold does today, but with a staggering death toll instead.  They know nothing of the largely smoothed over discoveries about the SSRI drug class, which may cause normally docile people to violently and mortally hurt themselves or others; a fact reduced to a warning label and extra FDA mandated handout about suicidal ideation.  Sadly, the point is lost on the very people who need to hear it most.  The film re-uses many suspense devices from film history.  My only quibble with The Happening is that the crazy old lady could have been better used than merely to amp up the suspense, since she was the one person in the whole movie who had actually divorced herself from the trappings of ""civilization"" and tended to her garden. While I suspect this film will come to the minds of many who have written it off the next time there is a breeze while they are in the park, I also suspect this is a film that will be better appreciated 25 years from now.",1213315200,,2404,4.78743961352657

1995680,3,6300248291,"(BEWARE MINOR SPOILERS)

I was dragged to the cinema to watch this tonight, and although I didn't fuss too much as I was mildly interested in watching it, I came out of the theater wishing I'd been able to slip out and watch 'Iron Man' or 'The Incredible Hulk' instead.

Keeping in mind that I haven't seen 'Lady in the Water', I have to say this was easily M. Night's weakest film. It's well directed and there are some really shocking moments, but several of those moments managed to draw unintentional laughter from the audience.

The script is a mess, and the characters are probably the least developed of any character created by M. Night. This film could have worked as a character drama (like Signs), but there wasn't enough time dedicated to the people we were following. The cause for ""the happening"" is interesting, but there's little logic in how it works. If the planet wants to poison the humans to death, why does it wait for groups of people to gather? Why doesn't it just err on the side of caution and produce a world wide dose of neuro-toxins and take everyone out in one fell swoop?

Mark Wahlberg is horribly miscast. Generally speaking I like him, but the nice guy character he plays in this film doesn't ring true. He's trying too hard to be a cuddly Biology professor, and it never feels genuine.

Leguizamo gives a good performance, but he's criminally underused. His character needed about 20 minutes more development.

Zooey Deschanel is perfect in the role of a meek, flaky estranged wife. She brings a warmth to the character that may have been missing had they cast someone else in the role. But again we have a performer who is criminally underused. The subplot revolving around her broken marriage to Whalberg's character isn't nearly as well rounded as the broken family life of Mel Gibson's character in Signs. In point of fact, this particular subplot should have been the meat of the film because all the stuff with the world striking back doesn't have the strength to carry the film.

(And if I may have a moment to ramble, I must comment on Zooey's eyes: this woman has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen, but I find it hard to look into them for too long on the big screen. It's like looking into the Ark of the Covenant -- the longer I look into them, the more I expect my face to melt off or my head to explode. Her eyes are like rich blue oceans, and I suspect M. Night agrees because there are a TON of extreme close-ups on Zooey's face.)

On another note, I have to confess that nothing irritates me more than misleading marketing, and in the case of The Happening, the marketing for this intensely misleading. Everything I've seen suggests that the film revolves around an apocalypse, but it doesn't. Only the Eastern seaboard is affected, and it only lasts for 24 hours. This film feels like a preface to a bigger disaster on the horizon, which is fine, but it feels like a slap in the face after seeing the film advertised as a movie about the end of the world.

The violence and gore in the film is a bit jarring, particularly considering M. Night has only done PG-13 films up to now, but M. Night directs it really well. It's a pity that his scripts seem to get weaker and weaker with each film, because he's a genuinely good director. He knows how to set up tension. I hope he has a better script for The Last Airbender.

James Newton Howard is on top form this time around, composing a score that revolves around a central motif that's the eeriest he's written since the theme for Signs. If this is out on CD, I will be buying it.

Over all, I think this was a pretty mediocre film. There are some genuinely good moments in the film, but their buried in the fallout of a barely coherent script. M. Night's direction is strong, but the story can barely sustain it's hour and thirty minute run time. This would have been better off as an episode of Fear Itself (or as a part of some other anthology series).

There was no twist this time, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and I think this film probably could have done with a bit of a twist. If you're a fan of M. Night's work, you'll probably want to see this. If you're not, you'll probably want to rent it or wait to see it on satellite.",1213315200,,4251,4.421994884910486

""The Happening,"" which is his latest creepy film, is a modern cautionary tale ripped from the collective sensibilities of life after Sept. 11, 2001 and the status of human beings in their interaction with today's environment.

Episodes of strange, chilling deaths that defy reason and boggle the mind in their shocking destructiveness erupt in major American cities in ""The Happening"".

Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore: a sensitive high school science teacher in Philadelphia. When an incident occurs in New York City, the whole northeastern part of the United States is put on alert.

Another teacher, Julian (John Leguizamo), manages to get train tickets for himself and his daughter to a more rural area. He invites Elliot and his emotionally distant wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), to travel with them in hopes of staying clear of the impending trouble.

The train is forced to stop because of communication problems and a paranoia of ""every man for himself"" creeps into the evacuees. Groups split up and start off by car - and then by foot - hoping to hide deeply into rural Pennsylvania.

Elliot and Alma come upon a remote farmhouse of an old woman - played by Betty Buckley - who's cut off from the world but might be able to help.

After an early winning streak of films (including ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""), Shyamalan's output since has been mostly perplexing to audiences and critics. He's a genre unto himself with story characteristics that are manufactured uniquely through deliberate perspective.

This has resulted in hit-or-miss propositions. He continues that distinct stamp in ""The Happening"" by creating a situation of paranoia that's very familiar in these times.

The detail of human beings finding it necessary to try and formulate answers from mysterious circumstances is well represented especially through Wahlberg's ""by the book"" science teacher.

The ""event"" also has to do with the environment around us. The question asked in the film is as follows: As humans are the most influential species on the planet, how will this dominance affect the finite resources of the planet? What force of nature will rise up against this dominance?

This particular circumstance also had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe. It used the unseen force as a pursuer much like his film ""The Birds"". The master of suspense is even represented in the soundtrack, which would be at home in any of his films.

Suspending disbelief is important in the experience of ""The Happening"". There are many unanswered improbabilities in the plot and some misconstrued elements that produced unintentional laughs. It's best to go with the flow and realize that - in M. Night Shyamalan's point of view - everything is out to get us.",1213315200,4,3066,5.085657370517929

Many might argue that since ""Unbreakable"" - some might even argue since ""The Sixth Sense"" - M. Night Shyamalan has built a reputation for ruining his films in the third act, after building incredible momentum during the opening hour or so.  ""Signs"" was fantastically suspenseful until the alien appeared in all its CGI glory and ""Lady in the Water"", while pleasing to the eye, suffered from a second half that was structurally a mess.  Well, the tradition continues with the third act of ""The Happening,"" but to a much lesser extent.  By no means do the weaker final twenty minutes detract from the overall experience.  This film has the potential to redeem Shyamalan as a director of solid suspense.

I must admit, that I fell prey to the hype, and was curious to see if Shyamalan could deliver with an R-rating.  He has.  This is not a gore film, though there are a few bloody moments that may have viewers turning away.  It isn't a horror film either.  This is a suspense story, through and through, and Shyamalan utilizes the R-rating to keep the audience uneasy and at the edge of their seats.  This is a seriously disturbing film, and while not overtly violent (much of the violence takes place off-screen), it is filled with haunting imagery that will stick with you long after you leave the theater.

Strangely the third act is ruined not by the now trademark Shyamalan-twist ending (SPOILER ALERT: there really isn't one to speak of).  Instead, by trying to maintain an extra-high level of suspense, it falls victim to the introduction of a cliche horror character: a borderline crazy old woman who lives by herself in a house without power, whose occasional crazy behavior serves not to further the plot, but instead to coax a few more jolts from the audience.

Apart from a few moments of preaching about humanity's effect on the environment, the rest of the ending works remarkably well.

Through a bit of a coincidence, I actually wound up seeing this film twice last night, the screenings quite literally back-to-back.  And while there was absolutely nothing new to be gained by the second viewing, I still found myself enjoying the ride.  And that's the best thing that can be said about Shyamalan's latest effort.  It's got a slightly disappointing finale, but the road that leads there is great fun.",1213315200,5,2360,4.813895781637717
