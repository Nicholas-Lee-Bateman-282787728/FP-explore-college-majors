189185,1,1572521597,"Don't buy this DVD. The sound is bad. The dialect in Leigh's films can be hard enough for us Yanks without having it be virtually inaudible and painfully blotted out by the music. The mix of this DVD is really bad and it spoils the movie. That said, the movie is fantastic; too bad the DVD does it such an injustice.",1017360000,10,316,4.19672131147541
189186,3,1572521597,"I'd give the movie five stars.  The problem is, the DVD release from Fox Lorber is awful.  There's something seriously wrong with the soundtrack; the dialog elements are drowned out by the music, and there's a synchronization problem that often leaves the left and right channel staggered by about half a second.  Even more distracting, added sound effects often come from the wrong channel compared to the supposed visual source of the sound.
My guess is that instead of using a properly mixed mono soundtrack, Fox Lorber went back to the multi-channel master tapes for the mono soundtrack and used them as a fake stereo master -- but did a really bad job on the mix.
Whatever the technical explanation, it ruined my enjoyment of the movie.",999993600,25,741,4.818897637795276
189187,5,1572521597,"""Meantime"" is a fascinating honest portrayal of a lower class family and their relatives and friends. All three men in the household are out of work and drive each other crazy when they aren't nursing their wounded pride with drink or petty criticisms. One son in the household, Colin, has built a life out of keeping his head down because he lacks the wit to compete intellectually. His brother Mark loves him but is jealous of any attention his brother receives so he alternates between bucking him up and tearing him down. Most of the acting is excellent and there is no denouement, sentimental focus, or social argument in it. It is just a humorous and tragic slice of life exalted by honesty.",995068800,2,697,4.67479674796748
189188,4,1572521597,"Portentousness, contrivances and misogyny aside, this is a modernist masterpiece, closer to Antonioni than Loach.  Leigh doesn't simply record the monumental, faceless, soulless tenements and urban environment that dwarf his characters, as a social-realist would: he allows them to shape his narrative, a rigid, static series of concrete tableaux.  Leigh doesn't reduce his characters to caricature, as he's often accused of - Thatcherism does, by removing all those things (hope, work, dreams etc.) that mark humanity and individuality.  As bitterly angry and funny as 'Naked'.",988329600,,578,5.776470588235294
189189,4,1572521597,"If you've any doubt of the difference between English and American cultures, watch this early Mike Leigh flick and then think about the fact that it was made for television.  The writing in this dark little number is  better than that of most of the movies released over here, let alone  anything American-made you'll ever see on television.
These are dark  character sketches, and I too was reminded of Leigh's Naked as watched,  though this movie doesn't share so much of Naked's explicit philosophizing.  It does share similarly benighted characters, however, and a central  character with the same shiftless way and easy ability to say whatever pops  into his head.
Phil Daniels portrays this character, Mark, the story's  wise fool: he knows enough to understand his situation is a horrible one;  he's quite adept at analyzing whatever goes on around him, and he's  revolted by it; but he does little to extricate himself from the situation;  his attitude reflects that of most in the film, expect perhaps for his aunt  who is always somewhat futilely trying to adjust the status quo.
Mark and  his brother Colin and their father (who looks perfectly like an older Phil  Daniels) are all on the dole, along with Gary Oldman's character Coxy.
As  Mark's half-witted brother, Tim Roth really steals the show; he's so deep  into his part, it's easy to forget he's acting.  The character development  in this story belongs mainly to Roth's character and though the movie seems  to start out focusing equally on all involved, events gradually accumulate  to have the greatest effect upon him.  Interaction especially with Coxy and  his brother stirs him to life and the consequences are both amusing and  touching.  Some viewers won't be happy with the ending--the change may not  be profound enough for them--but the change is there and it's a sign of  inward struggle, a slight pulsing signal of hope .
Kudos also to Marion  Bailey who plays the boys' mother.  Her role is not a particularly  sympathetic one, but in one striking scene when she plays hurt, your heart  goes out to this woman anyway.  You understand that beneath her surly  exterior there's a woman needing affection from her sons.
Often amusing  and surprisingly touching despite its torpid atmosphere, this cunningly  simple movie is most greatly enrichened by its characters, many of whom  will stay with me for quite some time.
(Footnote: As I watched Naked, I  thought that Mike Leigh may be the only director qualified to make a film  of Martin Amis's London Fields; Meantime confirms his qualifications for  me.)",963273600,13,2587,4.941724941724941
189190,5,1572521597,"This realist picture of the british working class was orginally made just for T.V. The reason it is now realeased on video is proberbly due to its highly noteworthy cast and the fact its directed by Mike Leigh. However  ""Meantime"" truely deseaves to be rediscoved- its a little gem!  Set on a council estate in London, Leigh masterfully caputures the sights  and sounds of his environment. The film centres around the unemployed  Pollock family, particually sons Mark and Colin. Mark(Phil Daniels) has an  attitude of frankness and nihilism, not unlike that of johney in Leighs  ""Naked"". Colin(Tim Roth) on the other hand is slow witted,  confused and vunerable to the outside world. Through-out the film we sense  Marks well guarded affection for his younger brother as he trys desperatly  to protect him.  Like most Leigh films ""Meantime"" is mostly  improvised, and as usual, he has a fine ensemble of actors who won't  disappoint. Daniels and Roth are both equally convincing and absorbing in  their roles- they even look like brothers! Gary Oldman makes his debut and  theatens to steal the whole show as impish, skinhead Coxy. But perhaps the  most commendable performance here belongs to Marion Bailey as the middle  class aunt who attempts to put an optomistic smile on their situation(only  to have her good intensions torn apart by Mark).  This film may be to bleak  and low-key for some viewers. There is no real story line to speak of, but  it is a very pure piece of art. I'd recomend it to anyone who is willing to  look beneath the surface.",944092800,13,1554,4.832699619771863

7797589,4,1572521597,"Mike Leigh's Meantime (1984) has gotten a new life with the Criterion release of this previously BBC only screened, made-for-TV film. It is an indictment of the Thatcher-era economic malaise where unemployment was soaring. It looks at a working class family, the Pollocks and their unemployed sons in particular (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) in London's East End that struggles with the lack of employment opportunities in a specific humanistic way. It is contrasted with the middle class family of their aunt (Marion Bailey) and her listless bank manager husband (Alfred Molina)from the suburbs that suffers in its own way. The film investigates other reactions to this dismal state such as becoming involved in the skinhead subculture through the energetic and aimless Coxy (the first screen appearance of Gary Oldman). It is an accurate reflection of the Thatcher years with remarkable performances from a number of actors who would go onto to successful careers later. The Criterion extras include: a new, restored 2K digital transfer, supervised by cinematographer Roger Pratt and director Mike Leigh, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack, a new conversation between Leigh and musician Jarvis Cocker, a new conversation between actor Marion Bailey and critic Amy Raphael, and an essay by film scholar Sean O'Sullivan.",1506556800,4,1321,5.41747572815534
7797590,4,1572521597,"This is an emotionally powerful and rather unique movie.  It is one of those films that you can ""appreciate"" because of how well done it is (by everyone all around in my opinion), yet it is mostly sad and depressing so hard to ""like"" or ""enjoy"" from that standpoint. Can be funny in a couple spots, but you feel bad for laughing because of the characters' plight. There are many bad reviews here, but most of them seem based on the quality of old VHS tapes or DVDs.  Criterion of course does a fine job cleaning this up, but it is not meant to be a visually dazzling affair (1984 depiction of British housing projects and the effects of poverty).

The film focuses on two brothers trying to find jobs when unemployment was rampant.  The one is mentally slow and socially awkward.  The other struggles to find purpose and pride given their circumstances, and refuses to give totally in to the skinhead/doc marten boot wearing friends that hang around. Much will be made of Gary Oldman's young punk character, who can sometimes fill the screen with dread in a movie that already makes you feel like you are waiting for the other shoe to drop. Some of the other actors may be more well known overseas, but Tim Roth (from the beginning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction-Blu-ray/dp/B001AQT0Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction [Blu-ray</a>]) plays one brother, and Alfred Molina (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolat/dp/B01KFAWO5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolat</a>) plays a small part as well.

Criterion's booklet mentions that this was the time Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and the film was supposed to be a partial comment on the policies of the day.  However, she never comes up directly in the film, and really neither does politics, except for one discussion on what ""economics"" means between the boy's mom and their aunt. Like many of the scenes it is very uncomfortable (Tim Roth's character, Colin, is uncomfortable just to look at and must have required great effort to stay in character).  Great direction by Mike Leigh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Sweet-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00BJB2H1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Sweet (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]), and the camerawork is particularly good.

Ultimately, ""Meantime"" is about the brothers and the choices one makes when there are not many real choices in life to be had. Somewhat of a coming of age film for Colin, but a bleak one at that.  Criterion extras are mostly interviews and are interesting but nothing to get too excited about. 4 1/2 stars.",1503619200,4,2702,5.616707616707616

It's a tad skitter-brained in the way it was thrown together, but Roth and Oldman outshine the limitations and flaws of the overall production.  In fact, their respective performances are genius.

7797594,3,1572521597,"Rather than a story, this film is impressionistic, moving from scene to scene in random sequence with sudden sharp focus.  The characters and acting - just look at the debut performances in the cast! - are extremely good, as are the comedic situations of the depressed unemployed going nowhere.  Oldman is a dumb skinhead.  Tim Roth is a dim-witted younger brother, devoid of ambition and self esteem; his older brother is a lazy cynic, also with no future.  The father and mother despise them, yet do nothing to change anything.  Molino is a long-suffering relative who works and is bored with his marriage to a rather nice alcoholic.

While I am a fan of Mike Leigh, this early effort is clearly before he has honed his storytelling skills, who will become first rate in such films as Life is Sweet or Secrets and Lies.  It is worth a look, but I would not recommend buying it.",1313020800,,879,4.596153846153846
