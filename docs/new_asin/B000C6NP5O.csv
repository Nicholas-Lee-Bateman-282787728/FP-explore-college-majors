8096123,5,B000C6NP5O,"First there was the PHANTOM OF INFERNO interactive anime DVD. Now we have the regular anime film based on it.

Here's the story: The main character (whose name, at least in the interactive DVD, was Reiji Azuma, not Kei, though here we never find out what it is,) is a recent high school graduate who is traveling to America for a month on vacation by himself. When he gets there he takes a ride from an unreliable cabbie who drops him off in a bad neighborhood. While there he walks by a building that a mob boss is leaving. Just then a sniper shoots and kills the mob boss and his companions. The boy looks and sees the sniper, a young girl, in the adjustant building. He turns and runs before she can shoot him. She chases him down into an alley and attacks him. He dodges several attacks, but then she knocks him down and is about to kill him, but then an older man in a white coat tells her to stop. He says the boy's skill is impressive, and the man wants him alive. So the girl drugs him and knocks him out.

He has a dream where he wakes up back at home, and sees his family shot in the heads and killed. Then he appears in school and sees his friends killed the same way. He then wakes up in an abandoned factory in the desert with the girl and older man with him. The man tells him his name is Sythe and the girl is Ein, and that his memory has been erased, and his new name is Zwei, and that if he wants to live, he must train to be an assassin. Ein too has had her memory erased, although she is haunted by dreams of her past where she is a little girl in a village when men with guns attack, killing everyone eles.

Over the next few weeks Zwei is trained, building his physical shape and improving his marksmanship. A butch-looking black woman named Lizzie stops by to check up on him one day. She tells him Ein is also known as Phantom because she is Inferno's top assassin.

Finally the day comes when Zwei join Ein on her missions as an assassin. Will he survive?

First and foremost I really loved getting to watch this show dubbed and with moving animation. (The interactive DVD is Japanese language only with optional English subtitles, and mostly just still images with sound effects.) It was a bit disapointing not getting to make decisions on what you want the main character to do, but then I knew that before I bought the disk.

There are several liberties taken with the story, which may be good or bad, depending on how you feel about that. The opening and closing scenes (the former of which happens before we even meet the main character, the latter of which occurs after the end credits of the last episode,) in which Ein is killing off rival gangsters, isn't shown in the interactive DVD. In the interactive DVD we also don't see the main character leaving Japan or coming to America; the story starts with him waking up in bed in the warehouse with amnesia. There is no mentioning of him having any siblings (although I thought the thing with him having a younger sister was a really nice touch, even if it didn't affect the main story at all.) His first meeting with Ein starts with him running into a reporter who's been shot and wounded. The reporter gives him a computer disk that presumably has info on it that could hurt Inferno, and tells him to take it to the police. Then the reporter dies. The protagonist freaks out and runs away. Ein sees him, and chases and then captures him. In his dream he has just before waking up in the warehouse it's just aobut Ein, and he doesn't see his friends and reletives being killed. When he wakes up with amnesia Claudia is there. (She has alot more screentime in the interactive disk, one of my few disapointments with the animation disk is that she has so little to do.) Scyth (his name here has a ""C"") tests him by having Ein give him a knife. Ein then attacks him. He manages to knock her down, and on reflex stabs her in the arm. She then punches him with her good arm and knocks him out. When he wakes up they are gone. He leaves the room and walks downstairs, and runs into Ein. She tells him he has amnesia, that his new name is Zwei and that if he wants to live he must work for them as an assassin. Then comes the training, and one day while Ein has left to go on a mission Claudia stops by, and it seems she has taken a deep, peronal interest in him. I'll stop there.

I had lots of fun watching PHANTOM the anime. Although the ending does feel satisfying, I really hope they make a sequel. Hopefully they'll flesh out Ein's backround more, we'll get to see more of Claudia, and maybe we'll even get to meet Cal. Anyway, this is one to check out.",1145923200,7,4634,4.259090909090909
