5242909,5,B0091V6TEA,"It's been so long since I've seen such a wonderful and thoughtful movie that made me both laugh AND cry!!  I believe it not only touched my heart but touched my soul as well.  The messages really spoke to me and I'm certain will speak to others in a profound way, especially those who feel isolated and yearn to find that ""treasure"" that at times seems lost forever.",1347753600,2,366,4.367647058823529
5242910,5,B0091V6TEA,This is not your typical film! It is very creative in the way the story unfolds and really a lot of fun to watch. You really care about the characters and it leaves you guessing until the end. Funny fun and heartwarming Rogue Saints really delivers! It's a good clean story the whole family can enjoy. I'll watch this one over and over!,1347408000,5,336,4.349206349206349
5242911,5,B0091V6TEA,"This is a great film for all ages. Most Christian films are very dramatic in nature, but Rogue Saints pulls off some great comedy that is rare in the faith film genre. Confidently recommended to anyone looking for good clean entertainment watchable with the whole family. This one is a winner!",1346889600,3,293,4.764705882352941
5242912,5,B0091V6TEA,"A great movie for all ages. Clean, good and fun. The lead actors are excellent and the story is full of great twists.  I laughed and I got a bit misty-eyed too.  It has a deep message about church, family and God's love.  Perfect Christmas gift for pretty much everyone on my list.",1346889600,3,281,4.264150943396227
5242913,5,B0091V6TEA,A fun and funny story which in the ends reminds us of our connections to one another and to God.  It reminds us that our church can and should be a place that we can call home.  I used this movie and the related study questions as the basis of an extended discussion with a group of married couples.,1395187200,,299,4.0508474576271185
5242914,3,B0091V6TEA,"A creatively imaginative story with some humor, but it lacks the meat of seeing real faith in Christ portrayed within the church community.  The emphasis in this film is that eventually relationship becomes more important than the quest for treasure.  That's good and in the meantime healing begins to take place from loss and disillusionment in faith.  I'd like to see the next step in the process.",1392940800,,399,4.925373134328358
5242915,5,B0091V6TEA,"This movie follows 2 young men through an attempt to steal a diamond.  One is a Christian who had lost his desire for God, and the other is an unbeliever.  In their attempt to steal the diamond from underneath a baptistry in a church, their attitudes go from contempt for other Christians to highly valuing them.  The whole movie has this tone, as it begins by poking fun at the unspoken rules of Christian fellowship (and we deserve that), and progressing to a great appreciation for the people in the church.  This movie makes you laugh, and it makes you think.  An excellent find.",1376524800,,583,4.5673076923076925
5242916,4,B0091V6TEA,"Well written with great playful plot.!  Fun to watch.  A bit amateurish & unpolished in points of the production.  Some acting not as smooth as it could be.  Over all we're glad to have bought it.
I'd rather watch a movie that is a bit amateurish & unpolished, but with a quality message entering into my eye gate & ear gate - - - than to watch a professionally polished show, that offends and/or desensitizes my heart & soul.",1376438400,,426,4.3544303797468356
5242917,4,B0091V6TEA,"I am directing a camp for Jr. High age kids at our church summer camping program. This movie looked like it could be used as a starting point for theme, discussions, and general planning for our week. We are using the theme Hanging Out With Jesus and I think the life lessons from the movie and the discussion guide will work very well for this age group. The movie is entertaining and very well made. I don't have any issues to deal with like bad language or explicit sex, violence, etc., yet I think it will be entertaining enough that the kids won't feel like I'm showing them a Disney movie. I'll edit this review after our week is over and maybe then I'll be able to give it 5 stars!",1371859200,,688,4.259541984732825
5242918,4,B0091V6TEA,"The tagline for this movie is: ""The greatest church diamond heist, romance, comedy, drama, adventure you've ever seen.""  And that's about right. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you probably haven't seen a better church diamond heist movie. :)

Besides being very entertaining, this movie has a lot of heart, and you get to see a transformation occur with the two lead characters as the genuine love of God's people really affects them.  Basically this is a feel-good movie with its biggest message being the importance of having (and being) a church family.  Despite largely taking place in a church, you won't hear much ""sermonizing"" or find any deep Christian conversion scenes or anything like that.  This is not a very deep movie theologically.  Because of the lack of deeper Christian content or discussions, it does at times seem like the church is just one big social club, rather than people that have been changed by Jesus and fellowship with one another because they have Jesus in common.  But if you can go into this movie thinking it is lighthearted Christian entertainment that also happens to say a few things, rather than expecting to see something super-spiritual, I think you'll be just fine.

Now, with these types of independent Christian films, the question often comes down to the quality level of acting and production.  I can say that both were reasonable. I can't say ""great"" on either front, but overall was perfectly sufficient.  The acting was believable enough to not distract too much.  The movie did have a very modern, quick-paced, almost ""cartoony"" style, that grated on me a bit, but all things considered, it was fine (and kids will probably love it).

This one can potentially be a good family night movie! There are some good family discussion points to be gleaned. The importance of church family and genuinely loving on people is a key one. Another related one is the need to be real and have meaningful and substantive relationships built on truth, rather than falsehood. A contrast is shown where one of the characters has 1,000 facebook friends but feels that most all of them aren't really true friends he can really depend on. There's also themes that include the futility of living life only for your own pleasure, and the importance of helping others. You could also talk about what conversion really entails as far as really turning to Jesus and explain what baptism is all about (there is a baptism scene at the end of the movie). Since there's a scene early on talking about the Trinity, you might want to take the opportunity to clarify what the Trinity is as best you can to any youngsters (God is Father, Son, Spirit - 3 personalities, 1 God.). Another discussion point could be why some people get angry at God when bad things happen (one of the characters did because of a major loss that occured earlier in his life) and how bitterness at God only hurts you. The movie does briefly raise the whole ""why are some healed when others aren't?"" question, which if you really feel you can provide a decent Biblical answer to, you might want to tackle.

All in all, this movie is a fun way to spend an evening and is recommended.

5242919,1,B0091V6TEA,"If you were really blessed and edified by movies like Facing the Giants, Sheffey, and The Printing, than this movie will really disappoint you.  For one, the acting is distractingly bad.  I almost never take that into consideration when I rate a Christian movie, since the acting was bad in Flywheel, but I really love that movie anyway.  Because the movie itself isn't good, the acting just adds to the overall feeling of disappointment.  This movie is not about Christ or about becoming saved, it's about enjoying fellowship with other ""Christians"".  Since it doesn't seem like most of the people in this story are true Christians at all, you are left with the feeling that you just saw a textbook definition of false conversion.  The story itself is totally unbelievable.  You'll laugh, but you won't come away from this film feeling drawn to Christ.  This movie makes Christianity look like a happy club that we should all be a part of.  Don't waste your time and money.",1362528000,4,974,4.7844311377245505

5242938,4,B0091V6TEA,"Excellent movie!  Well written, well acted, interesting story, strong message.  The message was easy for me to connect with and yet very deep--the issue of loneliness and connecting with others in the church.  This is a solid Christian movie not afraid of sharing the message of the gospel and yet a very well made movie.  I had high expectations going in and it surpassed them.

The four stars are because I was disappointed with the point of tranformation in the end I felt it was not handled well for both characters and drew me out of the story; however, the final resolution drew me back in again.

All in all I'd recommend it highly!",1352592000,3,639,4.56140350877193

Yes while this is a christian film it is first a movie and whether you are a christian of not it is simply entertaining. One thing I loved is it actually made fun of christians for how cooky and odd they can be. Definitely worth picking up this movie!",1351468800,5,360,4.388059701492537
5242940,5,B0091V6TEA,"I had the pleasure of watching this last Friday (10/19) at a showing in Seattle.  I really enjoyed it!

I gave this film 5 stars for two reasons.  First because it was entertaining, and that's what I like in a film.  But, also because I know (from someone involved in the making of it) that this film was made primarily with volunteer help, on a pretty low budget.  I'm an amateur filmmaker myself, so I know how much time and effort goes into making a film.  Most of mine are shorts and they take a ton of time - so I can only imagine the amount of time it would take to make a feature length film using all volunteers!  This must have truly been a labor of love, and I can definitely appreciate that.

I am a Christian, and I enjoyed the message - I thought it was related in a fresh way.  I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the church community - like a good strong family.  They were flawed and imperfect, but committed to each other, growing together, and abounding in grace.  They were concerned with loving God and others - not perfection.  This is what Christ desires in his church!

Overall I though the film was funny, unique, and moving.  The two main actors were great, I think they succeeded at creating endearing characters - which is also a tribute to the director and the screenwriter.  By the end of the film, I felt the main actors had done a good job of developing a believable sense of chemistry.  My one criticism is the acting of the supporting cast was weak at times.  But I qualify that statement with the understanding that they were probably volunteering their time, and quite possibly not trained actors.

Congrats to all who were involved!  And I'm looking forward to seeing more work from Mr. Lubanski!

There are a few scenes where the acting is a little hokey, but the main actors always shine.  If you are looking for a movie to watch with your family and friends, this is a great choice.",1350777600,2,444,4.011363636363637

The story-line was clever, the acting natural, camera work superb, and the script made me laugh and contemplate...I didn't cry though as some referenced in their reviews. It's a movie from a faith perspective that would connect well with those familiar with Christian culture, but it doesn't alienate and shouldn't offend those without that frame of reference.

It's a perfect choice for a family movie night...or a youth group/church group movie night. We enjoyed it...",1350777600,4,613,5.069306930693069

5242944,5,B0091V6TEA,"Rogue Saints is a MUST SEE!!! This ""diamond heist, romance, comedy, drama, adventure"" has a little something for everyone and will have you laughing out loud, wiping tears, cheering and most of all moved.

The beautiful cinematography, shot in the Seattle, WA area and on location in Puerto Rico, weaves this tapestry together - it's a treat for the eye and gives you much more than what meets the eye.

Childhood friends Nick (John Wu) and Dylan (Jason Pead) have walked very different journeys as adults, but reconnect and find themselves together again on an unexpected path with surprising results. The lead characters share an on-screen chemistry so real you forget they are actors on the screen. Dylan's playful antics, energy and humor balance Nick's focused, goal-oriented drive. Both carry remnants of their past and the audience gets to witness as they wrestle with their choices and determining what is really important in life. Beautiful Malea (Deanna Sarkar) brings a sweetness to the screen and the storyline full circle.

One of the little gems of this indie film is the supporting cast and background extras. Their personalities create the contextual backdrop for the bigger picture.

This movie is fresh, it's funny, and invites viewers to consider for themselves what it means to have faith, family and friends. It's a jewel and sure to be a family treasure!",1350345600,3,1376,5.048458149779735

You will laugh your way through this thoughtful story of what happens when people engage in real relationships.
