8467264,4,B005DOSEHE,"Great Movie,  A Classic all in its own!! My only downside is the Region 2 format stating that it can't be viewed on a standard DVD... There are many movies out there that are awful and were given DVD rights to be viewed on standard and yet this movie can only be viewed on a computer or Laptop.. DUH...!! Let me know when there's a DVD released for standard DVD players. I'll appreciate it more on the huge screen at home.",1417651200,,422,4.209876543209877
