2923900,3,B000UR9QQM,"I loved ""Roseanne"" because it was such a funny and realistic sitcom. There has never been a TV show that has portrayed such a true American family. My family was just like the Connors and I am certain there were millions of families just like this around the country. Why was Roseanne so shocking? This was the first time an actress had total creative control over her show. There wasn't a man telling Roseanne what to do. She set her own rules. Then she broke every one of them!

The last episode of ""Roseanne"" was a special hour-long program. There were a few good scenes on the last show. I liked that Roseanne included all of her supporting cast (not just the main stars) in the last ep. Because it added a touch of realism and closure. Of course in syndication and on Nick @ Nite these last 2 eps are butchered beyond recognition.

2923901,4,B000UR9QQM,"Ok so the final season of Roseanne may not be the highlight of the long running series, but it is the final season and it deserves it's time in the sun along with the rest. In 1996-1997 we find the Connors as lottery winners, David and Darlene a married couple with a baby on the way, and Dan and Roseanne on the outs. It is a long,strange trip they were on but it ends in a way no one could forsee. Some love the final moments of the final episode and others hate it, but it ties up some loose ends, and it's Roseanne's way of rectifying a lackluster season, and catch a glimpse at what her life could have been had she never made it big. If nothing else this season is a must see for the long list of guest stars in wacky, far out roles. All in All good series, ok season.",1188345600,3,774,4.0
2923902,3,B000UR9QQM,"Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed, and that is mainly why I am giving it three stars. Let me warn you there are SPOILERS AHEAD.

The season opens with Roseanne having retreated to Jackie's house after a tremendous fight with Dan over lifestyle changes he will have to make for the sake of his health.  He is in complete denial, and she lashes out in fear of losing him to a second heart attack. She spends the day parked on Jackie's couch, watching TV and fantasizing about the various sitcom couples that she watched as a child. At the conclusion of the episode, Roseanne and Dan reconcile, Roseanne returns home, and Jackie watches the announcement of the winning state lottery numbers. Much to her surprise, she and Roseanne have won the 108 million dollar Illinois state lottery. This is where the series begins to make a slow turn from the show you have become accustomed to into something that resembles ""Absolutely Fabulous, Midwest Style"".

The next major plot development is the cutting of the final rope that has been tethering this show to its former incarnation - the presence of John Goodman as Dan. Thus, in ""Honor Thy Mother"", Dan decides that with his newly found wealth he should try to see if something more than just ""warehousing"" can be done for his institutionalized mentally ill mother, and he takes off to a clinic in California to see to this task.

With Dan away from home and all the money in the world at her disposal, Roseanne takes the show on a series of fantasy episodes. First, the late Jim (""Ernest"") Varney stars as a prince who becomes enamored of Jackie after seeing her on TV and comes to town to woo her, then Jackie and Roseanne enter an expensive, exotic, and very oddball spa where they are subject to all kinds of torments that are supposed to invigorate body and soul, but just seem plain silly in many ways. The Halloween special makes clear what the audience has suspected all along - that Jackie and Roseanne have morphed into ""Absolutely Fabulous""' Patsy and Edina, with the real stars of that show guest starring.  Next, the Conners are invited to spend a weekend with the wealthy Wentworths on their Cape Cod estate. Apparently the Wentworths use pill-popping and overindulging in alcohol as a means of dealing with their personal problems rather than just ""letting it out"", and Roseanne is more than happy to teach the family how to release their anger. Quite frankly, the fine art of temper tantrums is one thing I've always felt the uber-rich had down pat.

Next is an episode so bad that it is seldom shown in syndication, and has me asking ""What WAS Roseanne thinking?"" Of course I am talking about ""Roseambo"". Seriously, this episode is ""Ed Wood"" bad. The villains in this episode are an ethnically diverse bunch, and yet they all have the same fake accent. There are two good jokes in this episode. The first is when the subservient middle-eastern women mumble through a choker and scarf and the subtitles don't match the mumblings.  The second good joke was when Roseanne was using such weapons as a set of hot rollers, dispensing with the terrorists one by one, and spouting parodies of action-movie tag lines such as ""Avon calling!"" after kicking down a door.

This ends the fantasy sequence part of the season, and the rest of the season is back in Lanford. The Thanksgiving episode is more oriented around family relationships, and thus there is an up-tick in quality. At Thanksgiving, Bev, Roseanne's mother, makes a startling revelation about her sexual orientation. It doesn't make much sense that Bev, divorced for several years, financially secure, and whose romantic trysts with men have been the subject of several shows in the interim, would come to such a self discovery in her 60's or have been afraid to admit this fact about herself until this point. I think it would have been better to concentrate on the other announcement of this episode - that Leon and Scott are planning to adopt - and focus on the hardships and road-blocks that abound when they set off on that road.

Next, in ""Home for the Holidays"", Dan returns to be home with the family at Christmas. There are happy moments - the Conners finally burn their mortgage - but at the same time, Dan seems uneasy and somewhat distant around Roseanne. At the conclusion of the episode we find out why, when Jackie overhears Dan on the phone talking tenderly to ""another woman"" - the nurse who is taking care of his mother in California. The next three episodes deal with the fallout of Roseanne finding out about the affair, confronting Dan about it, and mourning what seems to be the end of her marriage when she locks herself in her room and goes on a junk food binge. Although I really enjoyed these episodes as something that any woman who has been dumped for another could relate to, I found Dan's actions to be completely out of character. Perhaps that is the point - maybe Dan stayed by Roseanne's side through very bad times because he didn't really have any broader horizons in life, and now that he knows that he has alternatives he is taking them, or at least flirting with them.

After a very mundane two-parter in which Roseanne uses her wealth to help rescue the Wellman Plastics factory that she and her sister worked in during the first season, come two of the season's best episodes. First, in ""A Second Chance"", Dan returns to Roseanne in an attempt to start over. The couple's reunion is cut short when Jackie calls with news that Darlene has gone into early labor. ""The Miracle"" is one of my all-time favorite episodes of Roseanne. All medical intervention possible is used to stop Darlene from going into labor, but she does so anyway, and delivers a baby girl that even the medical experts Roseanne has retained say is too premature to survive. The episode shows us two things to which we are unaccustomed - David being strong and Darlene being overtly loving, vulnerable, and selfless. It's truly great and yet heartbreaking seeing the two being a normal loving couple comforting each other and grieving over the probable loss of their child.

The next three episodes - ""Roseanne-Feld"", ""The Truth Be Told"", and ""Arsenic and Old Mom"" are light-hearted comic romps that are OK but ultimately forgettable. However, the two-part series finale is excellent. It starts out somewhat slow, the premise being that the Connors and their friends are gathering for a celebration as Darlene and David bring their baby home from the hospital. But in the final ten minutes, through Roseanne's monologue, we learn that what we think we are seeing and have been seeing for the last seven years is actually a novel written by Roseanne based loosely on the truth. All of the characters do exist, but not as they have been portrayed in the show/novel. We also find out that Roseanne has recently experienced a horrendous personal loss rather than a tremendous financial windfall. This loss has caused Roseanne to throw herself into finishing her novel in the basement office that her family first set up for her at the conclusion of season two, where she hatches the state lottery storyline as a conclusion to the book she has been working on for seven years. We then see her finish her novel, put it aside, go into the living room that has the same drab furnishings from the previous seasons, and sit down to watch TV - alone. It was all very touching.

I guess since I have been hypercritical of more than a few of the individual episodes, some might wonder why I am giving this season a three star rating. I actually did not like this season during its initial run, but on repeated viewings it has grown on me. Standing all by itself it would truly be dreadful.  However, you have to remember that by the conclusion of the eighth season, just about every issue between the various Conner family members had already been tackled and the show had become stale, so that there were really only two options - end the show at that point, or take it in an entirely different direction, which is the choice that was made. Thus, taken in contrast with the previous eight seasons, and especially the very mundane eigth season, I really liked the ninth season for the chances it took.

You also have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By the ninth season, the show had gradually been losing that genuine quality of a real working-class family for a couple of seasons at least in part because, by 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. Thus it probably became increasingly difficult for her to inject something into her work that was becoming a distant memory for her. It was probably much easier for her to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth.  I'm subtracting two stars mainly because the production quality could have been much better even given the exact same storyline. There should have been more effort put into the delivery of lines, and some episodes came off as unrehearsed and hurriedly thrown together.  Plus, it really saddened me to see Laurie Metcalf's character of Jackie change from a delightful bundle of unpredictable neuroses into a sidekick with a Barney Fife-like quality. You have to ask yourself, though, do you actually believe that people would still be talking about this show if it had gone out with a whimper after its eighth season instead of taking the bizarre turn that it did in its ninth and final season? I seriously doubt it. Thus, I do recommend this DVD set to any Roseanne fan, especially if you are familiar with the previous eight seasons. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",1188259200,85,9849,4.710801393728223
2923903,5,B000UR9QQM,I'm very happy this is coming out sooner than the others took!  I'll finally have the complete series.  What a groundbreaking show.  As I re-watch the episodes I realize just how much Roseanne changed sit-coms and TV in general; the topics she addressed and the manner in which she addressed them was classic!  I can't wait to meet her in Chicago next month at her show!!!,1187827200,,372,4.590909090909091
2923904,4,B000UR9QQM,"Its amazing how a ninth season of any TV series deserves a 4 out of 5 rating in my opinon, and Roseanne Season Nine certainly does!! With all due respect to the 108 million dollar lottery winning, Jackie and the prince (""I picked the numbers"") David & Darlene's miracle baby, and so on, Roseanne tells what really went down in her writing room as we the audience listen in. This really keeps the whole series realistic again just when we all thought that the family that made ours feel better left us for another perfect TV story book ending. Roseanne is clever with this hard to finish finale! Don't pass it up, it really sums up the entire series with a great ending!!",1187395200,,670,4.455284552845528
2923905,1,B000UR9QQM,"Ever since Bob New heart had his TV series (where he owned a B/B in Vermont) it seemed practically every TV series in the nineties had to be a dream,someone's imagination (Saint Elsewhere, anyone?),or in the case of Roseanne her writing. Apparently, Roseanne wanted the final season to be all about her and no one else. It would have been good TV if it had been about the family dealing and trying to cope with Dan's sudden death. I think that the one who would've been hit as hard as Roseanne over Dan's death would've been Darlene, because she was clearly Dan's favorite. It would have made sense that the reason she had her baby prematurely was because of her grief over losing her dad and on her wedding day,no less! And to add insult to injury it was not just the last season that wasn't real but the entire eight years! I noticed that Crystal wasn't in the last season...so does that mean she wasn't real,too? If they had simply gone the way that I mentioned in the above,Roseanne's last season would've been as memorable and more importantly as watchable as the final episode of M*A*S*H. If they had to add a little fantasy to the mix it would've been a little more believable if Roseanne had written a book and sent it off to a publisher and it was accepted! So there would've been some joy with their sorrow. ",1490313600,,1318,4.468879668049793

2923920,5,B000UR9QQM,"And I mean that. I'm a huge fan of Roseanne, I love and own all nine seasons. And honestly, the ninth season got way more hate than it deserved, by both critics and audiences.

Am I saying it has no flaws? Of course not. The episodes Satan, Darling and Rosemambo were really bad. However, aside from the few poorly written episodes, this season I found to be just as hilarious and interesting as the others.

Was it different? Oh yes, but it was still funny to me. So the Conner family win the lottery and Dan cheats on Roseanne. Also, Darlene has her baby prematurely.

As far as them winning the lottery, yes it was unrealistic, but the way they handle the winning is too damn funny. And many viewers seem to not get despite becoming rich, the Conners remain working class.

On Thanksgiving, Roseanne takes the catered food to feed the homeless at the diner, and she kicks Dan out after she found out about him cheating on her.

As far as Dan cheating on Roseanne, I found that extremely shocking and out of the blue. But when you watch the final episode, it not only makes a ton of sense, but makes it all the more interesting.

The entire arc of Darlene's baby was extremely bittersweet and in my opinion, very well done.

Let's talk about the twist ending now. Warning, spoilers

On the final episode, Roseanne reveals the entire series had been a book her fictional character wrote. Most of it remains true, but she simply changed things she didn't like. In the reality, Dan didn't cheat on Roseanne, he died of his heart attack and they never won the lottery.

Many critics and people were floored and felt 'tricked'. To be perfectly frank, I found this 'disaster' ending pure genius. Not everything was a lie/trick. Roseanne and Dan still were married, still were a blue collar family, still had four kids, Jackie was still around. So calling it a big trick is really overkill.

I also felt like Roseanne simply pissed Critics off. They hated on this season, but when the twist ending happened, they were so frustrated that she tricked them, that instead of being proper critics and addressing the genius of it, Roseanne truly brought out critcs immature side.

One critic acted so immature in his review about the season, he even dropped the F bomb. I've never see a movie or TV show critic drop the F bomb in a 'professional' review.

Is it as good as the other seasons? Not quite, but I still REALLY enjoyed it, and honestly found the critics were acting VERY immature and unneedingly hateful of the season.

Roseanne will always be brilliant in my eyes, both the sitcom and the woman.",1449360000,3,2596,4.568965517241379

2923933,3,B000UR9QQM,"I loved Roseanne but at this point the show was sadly a former shell of itself.

The final season was truly the end for Roseanne and I don't mean as being a final season I mean an end to the comedy the humor the wit the general interest and so on for this show.

I admit I laughed and enjoyed some of the episodes of this season but for the most part I was bored rolling my eyes and couldn't believe the bad acting in the final season it was atrocious.

The only episodes I really enjoyed were the Dan Cheating on Roseanne Christmas episode somewhat parts of the Thanksgiving one and a few others.

I cant honestly say I LOVED the last season though if I did that I would be lying .

From the obvious bad acting to the fact that Roseanne just seemed like she just didn't care anymore and had no more interest to even make an effort at acting or comedy to so many other weaknesses and flaws of this final and dreadful end to Roseanne.

In the final season Jackie was a clown an overacting annoying clown funny only in tiny portions.

In the final season Dan seemed high was very erratic and just seemed to be sleepwalking through most of the episodes for the most part as if Goodman also no longer cared.

Bev was a shrill obnoxious character whose acting almost consistently at this point came across as forced and awkward and stiff.

Mark RIP Glenn was still funny at times but they made him stupid and Mark may have never been the brightest bulb but he was never stupid.

Becky was boring and bland and was rarely if ever funny I like Sarah Chalke but this show was just not the appropriate vehicle for her at that time.

I personally preferred Lecy Gorasen as Becky.

Darlene was moody and obnoxious in the final season however she seemed to have softened more becoming a mother yes that's a SPOILER for those who haven't watched this.

Roseanne even said herself at one point on her Myspace years ago that the final season was a big F U to the critics and the fans and when I saw this I lost a lot of respect for her .

I still like her but when she said that it was a slap in the face to the many fans who loved the show for so many years.

I don't know what was going on behind the scenes but you can tell in the final season things were not copacetic behind the scenes .

The end of this show was a humongous slap in the face and now that I know how Roseanne felt at that time it actually makes sense.

I cried and at the same time watching the finale I was angry that it ended the way it did.

Suffice it to say the final season is like a nightmare take that however you will.

The end of this show was ridiculous and made no sense and it was also incredibly depressing.

Granted I know this show was realer then a lot of shows back then and was meant to be more real and relatable but the final season was a cheap disrespectful slap in the face to the fans.

When I discovered what was really going on in the series finale suffice it to say I felt like I had been punked in the worst way possible.

I will enjoy seasons 1- 7 some of 8 but that's it season 9 was truly the end of a beloved series that deserved so much better then what it got in the series finale.",1426550400,,3172,4.090468497576737
2923934,1,B000UR9QQM,"OK, I see some people on here being realistic, and others who are trying to pretend like Season 9 is anything like the better seasons of Roseanne. If you haven't seen it already, these episodes are a far, far cry from the earlier seasons of the show. Most real Roseanne fans already know it and admit it.

This is the lottery win season. Some people say this is where the show jumped the shark, and it would be if it hadn't already done it before the lottery win. This season contains the show's worst episodes, such as Roseambo, Millions From Heaven, Someday My Prince Will Come, and Satan Darling. The problem? Most of the episodes in Season 9 are outlandish, badly acted and unfunny. The total opposite of what the show previously was (although I noticed a decline starting back around the time Andy was born, in Season 7). To myself and many others, Season 9 does not even seem like Roseanne, it seemed like a totally different show because everyone was acting so out if character.

Where do I begin? Well, obviously the lottery win changed the whole dynamic of the show. The way it was executed, did not work and would've been better off undone. From then on, it's a further downward spiral, and we are subjected to numerous episodes with little to no substance (or comedy). A summary of Season 9 is lottery win, Jackie & Roseanne going to the spa, Roseanne fighting terrorists on a train, Bev coming out of the closet at Thanksgiving, Dan having an affair, Dan's mom trying to kill him, Leon and Bev suddenly become friends (ya know since they're both gay and all...), etc. There is a lot wrong and I can't even condense it all. Roseanne is one of the best shows to ever air, however I have to be unbiased and admit that the final season was awful (which is why in the final episode Roseanne tries to claim Season 9 was all a dream that she wrote up). In fact, it would have been best if Roseanne ended after Jackie & Fred's wedding, because the show wouldn't have been plagued with the next couple of unnecessary seasons.

What brung the show down was the dream sequences, the lottery, switching Beckys every week, making Mark unbelievably dumb, and too many superfluous characters being brought in, like that Stacy chick at the Lunch Box, Leon's bf Scott, DJ's girlfriend, Jerry, etc. Geez. You can't go wrong with Seasons 1-6, they are damn near perfect. Season 7 was OK, not bad but not the best. Seasons 8 & 9 are not worth bothering with, especially 9. This is the season where Roseanne dreams Darlene gives birth to the Devil at some party. When the devil shows up as a guest star you know things aren't looking too good.",1426291200,3,2634,4.517819706498952

2923959,3,B000UR9QQM,"Roseanne managed to stay at the top of it's game for six seasons. Starting with the seventh season, we began to see flaws in the show that would eventually become it's downfall. The first nine episodes of this season are completely nuts, encompassing and exacerbating those then-minor flaws that began to appear around seasons seven. Roseanne wins the lottery, dispatches trains of terrorists and experiences the high life of the rich and famous. After those nine consecutive train-wreck episodes, everything begins to cool down. The show returns to Lanford and the lottery winnings from the beginning of the season sit on the back burner and are only mentioned to progress the plots in a few instances. Despite being more focused, the final fifteen episodes still suffer. A more serious tone takes over the last fifteen episodes and really hard to watch for one reason or another. Some are too far out-of-character or are just too heartbreaking. It all culminates in a series finale that will leave you incredibly frustrated, in tears or both, as it is for most people.

I think during those first nine episodes of the season, Roseanne and her writers didn't really care at that point. Then with the finale episode looming in the distances, Rosie figured out what she wanted to say with these characters. Alas, it was too little, too late.",1377820800,,1340,4.929203539823009

I doubt I'll ever watch them again after going through them once.  The show strayed too far from the whole blue collar/working class element that made it a likeable show in the first place.  Winning the lottery was a big mistake because it led to these very unrealistic and delusional and flat out boring episodes of running around with the rich crowd and dreaming of being Rambo, Evita, etc.  On the bonus material Roseanne said she wanted to go out with bang and she did - but it backfired.  Roseanne(the show) stopped being Roseanne around season 7 in my opinion and went downhill with Roseanne having another baby(Jerry).  Having Dan Conner missing for half the episodes and cheating on Roseanne didn't seem anything like the Dan Conner of the previous 8 seasons and it was disapointing to not see John Goodman in every episode because he was a very likeable character AND actor(he was missing in half the episodes - huge mistake).

I'm not a television watcher, but the Roseanne show I definitely had to tune in.  I loved all of the seasons except this one.  Season 9 seems to start off alright on the first disc.  I'd say the first 3-5 episodes, then it takes a huge turn and gets lame and boring.  You know you're no longer watching the infamous Roseanne television series that will go down in history as one of the top enjoyable series of all time. By the time you get to the last few episodes on the last disc, the season starts to redeem itself a bit, but by then it's almost too little too late.

Someone told me that once a show goes to Disney world or some other location, the show has officially hit rock bottom.  It's truly disappointing because the Roseanne show could have really gone out with a bang.  Apparently, it was Roseanne herself's idea to go in this direction.  By this time she was one of the biggest television stars out there and no doubt had power and clout.  Unfortunately, if you head down a wrong direction and your ego is so great you won't listen to others telling you it's not the way to go, then you have this Season 9 mess.  I own every Roseanne season except nine.  I won't buy this unless they're offering it for a couple of dollars.

I love how they are an average, loving, dysfunctional family dealing with being working class and making it through real life situations in a truly unique and funny way.

I just got the pre-ordered release of Season 7 & 8 and was thrilled to see I can now also pre-order Season 9 for a good price.  Those sharks on other sites as well as this one trying to get hundreds of dollars was ridiculous and it's now over for them.

The first 8 seasons hold up very well even 25 years after the show began.  The subject matter is relevant and amusing today just as it was then.  If anything, it is more advanced than most of the new tripe showing all of the females on sitcoms sexualized, stupid, etc.  Roseanne's character is savvy, loving, a realist, perfectly flawed, and a REAL woman through her vivid and assertive personality.  She is equal to her husband and he knows it and is evolved enough to accept it...most of the time.

The 9th Season did suffer through some nonsense.  Some of the shows are really nearly unwatchable.  But at this very reasonable price for the new release, buying this last season is worth every penny.  As you watch this season, many of the shows are unrealistic and cross into totally silliness and a few are just not funny, amusing or even able to hold up to reality.  However, and this is a big However, The series' 2 part finale is worth the watch of the entire season.  This finale is always in the top 100 all time best finales.  It puts all of the silly shows through the 9th season into a light that makes most of it make complete sense and I still consider it one of the genius finales ever.

2924052,2,B000UR9QQM,"often times when major success hits a creative project, those involved become rich and indulged and slowly lose their creative edge. the ""yes men"" start breathing down your neck; telling you that your farts smell like roses. seasons 1-4 of this show you can tell they were green, hungry, excited and chock full of great ideas. then they all got wealthy and in Roseanne's case; delusional. what started out as a lower class redneck overweight wisecracking woman that so many people could relate to later became an arrogant, rhino-plastic snob who started to believe that she had become attractive and pretty. and the plots were all centered around the male characters doing stupid meatheaded things, from innocent(david and mark)to severe (dan conner cheating). the show became a man-hating affair with some serious lesbian undertones. her nagging had become annoying rather than hilarious. i think the lottery idea came about because roseanne had become so full of herself that she felt she could no longer get away with wearing her old lower class wardrobe; and with the conner family's newfound wealth, she could wear and plastic lift and tuck whatever she wanted...trying to persuade the public and herself that she was a drop dead gorgeous woman...a far cry from the 300 lb. comedic genius of the first 3 seasons. there was no truth to any of her delusional beliefs about herself that plagued and pretty much ruined the final season and thats sad. but to her credit, she is far from the only one that allowed success and money to cloud their creative judgement. its happened to so many shows, movie sequels, and musical artists. but seasons 1-5 are where its at!",1358035200,,1666,4.932384341637011

Yes, it is different from the previous 8 seasons, however, it was planned to be both different and the last. The show was run on things that she both had dealt with and was dealing with at the time. Her lifestyle changed, as it was reflected in the show.
I did not like everything about the final, however it makes since. The way it's explained and the reasons for it simply put it into perspective. If you really look at the season develop, you see something is off with some of the characters personalities and decisions they make.
Take the season on it's own, and most people are right. It doesn't hold up. However, look at the show from season one through nine, and the final episode/episodes explain what happend, and for the character it makes COMPLETE since and ends well.",1349568000,,938,4.523529411764706

If you are not a writer or don't really know anything about writing, then you will probably hate this season. The thing you have to keep in mind, is that from the first season Roseanne Connor was and always would be a writer. It's peppered throughout the dialogue in a few seasons but easily forgotten amongst the genius performances and writing. This is the whole point of the series:

This is a show ABOUT a writer written BY a writer.

If you don't realise that especially after the very last episode, then you probably never will. But if you do, you will see how perfectly orchestrated the whole series is and why it will last forever.

2924058,1,B000UR9QQM,"It seems Roseanne wanted to try something new in her 9th year on the air, and the idea wasn't neccessarily bad. The theme of the entire season starts when Roseanne and Jackie win the lottery, something like $200 or $300 million. It the shows how then Connors adapt to the richer life after spending most of their lives in the middle class.

While the idea is good, the writing had been gradually weakening since season 4, and it hits rock bottom here. I cannot think of one good standout episode from this year, but the Martha's Vineyard one was atrocious. The one with Debbie Reynolds was all right, but only because of her. I also heard that 'Roseambo' is the worst episode of the series, but they never aired it on Nick At Nite (Maybe post 9/11 worries?). I actually think the twist at the end is pretty original, but this is a tv series, not a movie, and you'll have to discount the ending if you want to be able to watch the older episodes and enjoy them for what they are. Once again, good idea for a movie, bad for a tv series.

Avoid this no matter how much you loved the series. I'll give them an A for effort, but that does not translate into an enjoyable viewing experience.",1282435200,4,1185,4.333333333333333
2924059,1,B000UR9QQM,"I found this season more than demoralizing. As some people mentioned, most everyone acts out of character and their actions are so absurd and far fetched - bordering at unbelievable. There were times i seriously thought this was another show. It is as if the characters had no self awareness as to who they are and their pasts (continuity) and as if their personalities were rewritten to be new people. For example, the Dan we met in all the previous 8 seasons would never have cheated on Roseanne. He was just not the type. If he _did_ cheat on her because he now all of a sudden had the riches to be able to afford such indiscretions, it still would be out of character for him because - again - the Dan we met is not someone who'd cheat on his wife. So no matter how you twist and turn it, this just doesnt make sense.

And then seeing Darlene go from being a free spirited, ambitious and somewhat jaded artist -  who was the first Connor to go to college and out of Lanford -  suddenly act all homely, sweet, calm and tender and decide to lead the kind of life her mother essentially had (and which she loathed), also seems out of place. In the previous season she got a job for a pretty decent salary in a publishing house, and now we are to believe that she gave all that up to be a mommy? That is so out of character. By the ninth season she even moves in with her parents no questions asked and apparently forgets everything about her ambitions in order to become what....a good housewife? Darlene?

Jackie's role is reduced to that of merely ornamental. She used to be so funny and quirky and involved from the beginning on and starting around season 8, her role was reduced to one walking around with a baby in her arm, running into a room screaming something and then leaving again. Throughout the series, Jackie's presence in Roseanne's life had a profound meaning; you knew these women were really each others' best friends and the extent to which Jackie's presence was essential for Roseanne and her family was also very well worked out. All that is lost starting season 8 and especially in this season and the two barely ever have any meaningful exchange anymore.

I think frankly, a lot of it might have to do with Roseanne's character (or in fact Roseanne Barr herself) who has - since season 6 - increasingly turned into just an annoying and unfunny figure. She is mean, vile, and unpleasant to be around. While in the first 5 or 6 seasons, there was a charm to her character and its causticity, because she was genuine and real, in Seasons 7 and 8 and now 9, there is a bitter aftertaste in your mouth every time she is in a scene and says something. I mean she never has anything intelligent to say, she never listens to anyone and she talks sh$%t ALL THE TIME. She also treats everyone like crap and while before that was actually cute, it is very annoying and sickening now. I think it has to do with the fact that Roseanne Barr herself, while this season was being shot, was having the hyper kind of life with all the success going in over her head, and doing things like getting plastic surgery (which made her look like a freak if you ask me) and divorcing her second husband to marry her bodyguard. She was becoming arrogant due to the previous successes of the show and that is what ultimately lead to the demise of seasons 8 and 9 - as apparently she was also given more creative control and wrote some of the episodes - which in turn would explain their sheer insanity.

It is interesting to observe the kind of evolution TV shows go through as they move along in years.

1) At first they start off very down to earth and innocent and actually as pretty original. They are feel-good shows, cozy, fun, simple.
3) Then, as the show takes off in both ratings and reviews as well as with respect to the fame of the actors, the writers become lazy or are replaced quickly (thus the old formula is lost as everyone thinks they need to hire new folks to write exotic and outrageous scripts). The dynamic of the show changes accordingly. Now all cast members are stars and important, and the show reflects that and in a way moves away from the simple beginnings. As the private lives of the stars change, so do their characters. There is often a spill-over effect into the show from behind the camera glamor. Roseanne Barr herself did undergo a huge transformation, going from a simple, blue collar unremarkable woman to a Hollywood star winning numerous awards and leading an exotic, fancy lifestyle. Such dramatic changes will not go unnoticed in the show.
3) Finally, the show ends on some absurd or far-fetched note, often something dramatic and sappy; a 180 degree turn from how it started out. In this last segment, the characters are often unrecognizable and rarely resemble the people we saw in the first few seasons.

In summary, this season was terrible. They completely messed up the show by turning 180 degrees and making it into some kind of a soapy, sappy drama or - as I like to call it - some kind of alive version of Roseanne Barr's insanity. The show started off fresh, down to earth, warm and kind but it just ended with Roseanne's obvious insanity and neurosis' from some kind of a midlife crisis she had and too much fame. Winning the lottery, Dan getting a heart attack, cheating on her, dying, Beverly a lesbian at 70 - and then what was up with all those superfluous plot lines involving Leon and boyfriend. Come on. They should have stopped after the 7th season. This ending was just a depressing downward spiral unworthy of the spirit of the show.",1273536000,16,5594,4.472086190009795
2924070,2,B000UR9QQM,"This season is by far the worst season of the series' run. Not because every episode was necessarily bad...there were actually some very good episodes throughout the year, but because the whole ""lottery"" plot was kind of unbelievable (even though poor people DO win the lottery sometimes), and because the show lurched back and forth between very believable episodes (the first 3 or 4) and a few towards the end (Darlene giving birth), and totally farcical ""fantasy"" episodes (almost the entire middle of the season, which were mostly without Dan's character), as well as having Roseanne's mother coming out of the closet at almost 70 years old (that seemed very forced and ridiculous at that point) and Dan's mother trying to kill him (????) that were all played like some 3rd rate moronic sitcom, which ""Roseanne"" never was. So alot of its credibility as a very realistic show was lost. In fact, it was already starting to lose some of its credibility in past seasons (though mostly still very well done) - like when they had Roseanne's father revealed to be physically abusive, which went against the way he was treated in the earlier seasons, as someone that Jackie & Roseanne got along with great. Anyhow, one of the biggest problems with the final season is how the last 10 minutes wrapped everything up, revealing that Dan was already dead, they never actually won the lottery (okay...good) but that Becky & Darlene were actually married to the opposite brothers. Does that mean that the last 7 years of the show were all just made up?? And that Jackie was actually revealed to be gay, instead of the mother. Does that mean Jackie never married Fred or had his baby? Was her character an entire lie throughout the entire run of the series?? It was just insulting to the audience. It makes you go back & watch every other season wondering just what exactly did or did not take place. That's just ridiculous, and forced. Like Roseanne wanted to simply be provacative, but at the sake of being believable and realistic. It's a season that is worth owning, but skip over many of the more ridiculous episodes, and skip that last 10 minutes.",1265760000,2,2142,4.760752688172043
2924071,2,B000UR9QQM,"I have enjoyed the entire series run of Roseanne, I always found it extremely humorous and well written for a sitcom, that is until Season 9. I remember the announcement that John Goodman would not be a part of most of the season and it's like the writers just gave up without his character being a part of the season. Season 9 is a train wreck (and yes there is even an episode with a train wreck) which only gets mildly better at the finale.

The season begins with Dan post-heart attack and his inability to stick with his diet which leads up to a big blow up between Roseanne and Dan which of course they reconcile. Right after they find out they won the lottery. Shortly after Dan decides to leave for California to take of his mom and it's right here the season goes haywire. Following Dan's departure we are subjected to some of the worst writing in television history with what is known as the fantasy episodes. All of these episodes revolve around Roseanne and Jackie as diva like wannabee mid-western gals, what's worse is not only are we sans Dan, but Becky and Darleen are absent from most of these episodes as well. These episodes are poorly written, terribly acted, and the story lines are so outlandish and tacky they are just painful to watch.

Following the fantasy episodes Dan, Becky, and Darleen return and the show begins to return more true to form, but compared to any of the other seasons these last episodes still seem pretty roughly written and the characters just do not seem the same. I really have to wonder if there was a change in writers during this season because it's pretty harsh. With the family reunited we are dealt 2 major story arcs leading to the series finale. Dan having a quasi affair while he was in California and Darleen having the baby much too early and the struggle to save it. Everything gets resolved in the end which leads into the finale which actually I think was brilliantly done despite what many others think.

In the finale we learn the series of Roseanne had been little more than a novel written by Roseanne. It is unclear if the entire show was a ""dream"" or just everything following season 2 after Roseanne got her writing room in the basement. We learn the Conners never won the lottery, Dan died from his heart attack the year prior which is right on the time Dan had his in the season 8 finale. Also we learn Jackie was gay, not Bev, Leon was much more of a feminine homosexual than he was written in the series, and Darleen married Mark while David married Becky. We do also learn the baby coming too early did indeed happen which is what snapped Roseanne from her depression after losing Dan. Roseanne also mentions that she thought Dan dying felt like she had been cheated on which I can only surmise is to tie in what was otherwise a totally out of character story arch for Dan the few episodes prior.

Regardless of season 9 being really bad overall, I feel the finale was a bit of a tear jerker and quite emotion filled, while still being true to the overall back theme of the series of a strong woman who is the family patriarch.",1257811200,11,3102,4.455985915492958

2924075,5,B000UR9QQM,"Okay, I won't give an episode list here, because it's been done by so many other reviewers.  And I won't give too many spoilers in case someone hasn't seen the season in its entirety or at all.

Look, this season gets slammed by people for being so different from the others and some of the episodes being so ""far fetched.""  In fact, I find this season funnier than the first.  It seems that in every episode, Roseanne pokes fun at her own ""ample frame,"" and her delivery is fantastic!  She's half the time ... half naked!  And it seems she can barely contain her own laughter, which makes it all the more hilarious!  People didn't like Leon and Scott being in so many episodes, feeling that Roseanne was just trying to cash in on the ""gay comedy"" trend, but I found them so awesome and loved that they had extra time in this last season!  Bev (Roseanne's mother), added some hilarity, as well.  This season just seemed to wrap up everything that had happened in previous seasons. And everybody was involved!  I loved that everyone had some plot that surrounded their character.

Don't get me wrong, there are some episodes that I completely skip because I don't care for them ... but that happens (for me, at least) with almost every DVD set you buy.  This season was FUN!  They knew it was to be the last season and they had fun with it.  And let's face it, by Season 9, Roseanne really had no idea what it was like to be a ""domestic goddess.""  She wasn't living that way, herself, anymore.  You got to see what the other half live like, were it one of ""us"" who got lucky.  Just like she did.  I like that.  Also, during the last episode, you find out the reasoning behind all the other episodes and it makes you better understand what was going on.  If you gave up half way through the season, it's a shame ... because it does all tie together and is actually very moving and sweet at the end.  The first time I watched the finale, I actually cried.

This family was just like mine, just as I'm sure it was for so many other people.  I watched them get older and grow as I did.  Watching the last season, I celebrated when they won the lottery, just as if it were a regular joe like me.  Watching them struggle through the other eight seasons, it was so well deserved and I actually felt great FOR them.  In the last episode, you can't help but get choked up - nine years later, the way things turned out.  It's an emotional season.

The only real con about this season for me was the amount of episodes that John Goodman was in.  For me, ""Dan"" was always a favorite, his physical comedy being the best part of the show.  In this season, he's gone half the time, which is such a let down.

Overall, though, I love this show and Season 9 is a welcome addition to finish my collection.  If you watch it all the way through, you'll appreciate it, as well.",1238371200,2,2855,4.298311444652908

2924079,4,B000UR9QQM,"From here on there are spoilers, but most of us have seen the show already...  wait, this is the start of my review?  Oh well.  Bees are black and yellow too.

I was surprised this show was renewed for a 9th season, as Dan's heart attack not only ended the 8th season, but the show being about the Conner family.

Season 9 starts with Jackie and Roseanne winning the lottery.  This allows for new subplots to be explored (rich vs working class, et al).

The finale is also a shocker - it's not a dream, JR doesn't come back alive (neither does Dan), and it's essentially said that Roseanne's story (everything from when her family gave her the basement as a writer's study in season 2 onward) was the book she was writing; and the fates of the characters given unexpected shake-ups.  Roseanne gets real credit for having dared to experiment, though at this point the show wasn't about the Conner family anymore.  It couldn't.  Dan wasn't around half the time...

And because he wasn't, other characters took his place.  More time was spent on Leon, Mark, David, Darlene, et al...

The holiday episodes are also high marks for creativity, if not being unorthodox -- the Halloween episode features the cast of the BBC sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"".  This is not, nor can it be, a typical Roseanne Halloween.  And it does a good job at being wacky, but it's crude.  ""Satan, Darling"" is the name of that episode.

""Pampered to a Pulp"" is another crude but terrific entry, as Roseanne and Jackie go to a spa and get a treatment they were not expecting...

""Home is Where the Afghan Is"" is the Thanksgiving episode that features another shake-up or two.  It's different with Dan being gone, but it features some great character moments with Roseanne's mom... and a particularly welcoming ending that reminds us the show still thinks of its roots while moving forward...

I also found ""Hoi Polloi Meets Hoiti Toiti"" amusing; Roseanne and her extended family go and meet this rich snobby family.  Some of the one-liners and gags are hilarious, especially the ones pertaining to dinner time and how often clothes get changed...

""The Truth Be Told"" is a semi-parallel to Roseanne (the actress) and her rise to fame.  At this point it's clear that a lot of the season has a lit of tidbits revolving around Roseanne (the actress)'s personal life, but most comedy stems from real life at one point or another anyway.

""Into That Good Night"" is the finale, of course.  Already mentioned, if nothing else get the DVD set for this one.

DVD quality is on par.  6~7 episodes per disc is a nicety too.

There's a lot of flak in this season, partly due to the cast being shaken up (actors leaving, reduced roles, altered motivations), but the finale explains all that away.

True, this show is no longer about the Conners, and the heyday is long over with, but there IS something of value in this final season.

Oddly enough, I'm glad I bought it.  And the only reason I did was because Roseanne has said some things over the last year that really perked me up - so buying the disc ensures she'll get some residuals.  The fact some of these episodes aren't utterly stupid is a bonus.  And, yeah, some episodes are worth forgetting...  but you'll have to watch and decide for yourself. ;)",1221609600,,3268,4.626086956521739

Only recently, a bankrupt trailer park couple won over a quarter of a billion dollars in a mega multi-state lottery, so why not the Connors? Fantastic perhaps, but wildly entertaining.

2924125,4,B000UR9QQM,"I have watched Roseanne since the beginning in real time, I've watched all the episodes in re-runs on various stations and now I own the entire series on DVD. This being the last season it certainly wasn't the best, and some even say it wasn't even remotely good. I'm only giving it 4 stars because even though many of the storylines were cheesy, the actors and the characters themselves are so loveable that I still had to watch it. A few episodes in this season drove me nuts (i.e. terrorists on the train?) and the storyline with Jackie and the Prince was just plain silly. However, what WAS incredibly good about it ...if you were truly a ROSEANNE fan, you'd KNOW that she was poking fun at the entire thing..it wasn't even supposed to go to season 9..and so they had tons of fun making this last season wild and crazy. Take the episode where the networks are fighting to get Rosie's story..and Jackie comes out with a line, ""it's gonna be hard to watch the emmy's this year!"". DUH! It was a line relating to that episode and the storyline but it also had another meaning, IT WAS A FREAKIN' JOKE. The whole thing was a joke. But, since they knew it was the end they had to make it somehow all tie together and I think for what it's worth the last episode did a decent job at that. I agree with another person's comment on here saying that Leon and Scott were overly-saturating in this season, they should have found a way to incorporate some even older characters and enough with the gay guys already! They were kinda funny but not nearly as funny as Nancy!
The fact that the whole season was, in essence, a story being written by Roseanne after Dan's death was a nice way to explain all the ridiculousness. It was her coping mechanism. Let's face it - even the best written shows eventually run out of steam (i.e. Gilmore Girls).
It was time to end it and why not have fun with it? I have to admit even with all the goofiness of this last season - the very last scene where Roseanne comes out of the basement and sits on the couch..the ORIGINAL couch in her ORIGINAL living room...I choked up. People who ""grew up"" watching Roseanne could appreciate this.
Also, there were some key moments in season 9 that made you remember old school Roseanne. Like when she gives Dan the mortgage payment and a lighter for Christmas so he can burn it (because they won the lottery and they didn't need it anymore!). If you were watching it for the first time and didn't know the end and that it was all a dream of sorts - this would make you cry! It makes me cry because I HATE my mortgage and the mere thought of being able to do that brings me to tears for MYSELF. I remember all the episodes from earlier seasons where Dan and Roseanne struggled on a daily basis to pay bills and their mortgage. Being able to burn it was incredible. When you fall in love with a show and it's characters you actually feel HAPPY for them. Like, THANK GOD THEY DESERVE THAT! So what it was silly and so unrealistic? WHO CARES? Season 7-9 slowly but surely got worse but even 7 and 8 remained true to the world in terms of realism. Any of those things could have easily happened to almost anyone else on earth. I recommend someone watch ROSEANNE from season 1 - season 9 to really get the full picture. Give yourself a chance to love the characters, because you inevitably do. No other sitcom in the history of television was as powerful in so many ways as Roseanne - and it will never be beaten out. EVER.",1195689600,3,3481,4.3486943164362515

Before buying each series I read the amazon reviews on it.  They slowly got worse with each new season.  Nevertheless I still thoroughly enjoyed each one right up to and including series 8.  Of course they lost a bit of their zap and some of the characters got exagerated (Eg. Marks increasing Stupidity with each series).  But still they were good and I watch them over and over again.

Sorry but Season 9 did not work for me at all.  Most of the episodes were not particuarly clever and the ending was a disaster.  It only gets 2 stars, and not one, for the episode with Darlene and her premature baby.  That and the couple of episodes around it were good, but this is not enough to justify a series.

8214391,5,B000UR9QQM,"This was my favorite show next to Golden Girls, the Cosby Show, and Mash when I was growing up (I was an odd duck....don't judge...) and I still love it. I am excited as hell that they're putting the show BACK ON television soon!",1503792000,,229,4.2272727272727275
8214392,3,B000UR9QQM,"Love Roseanne the series in general, but Season 9 is hard to watch  so many cringe-worthy episodes. Talk abbot jumping the shark. I cant imagine how the new reboot is going to explain all the weirdness that went on. Perhaps a Bobby Euwing dream season?",1499385600,,252,4.6

8214394,1,B000UR9QQM,The Most Awful Season Ever!!! Season 9!!!:( Seasons 1-8 were Awesome ( but it was Sad when they had Dan Die in Season 8 at Darlene's Wedding.) You would Think that they would of done Season 9 a lot different like other tv shows. The ratings went Way Down for the 9th Season.:(,1492560000,,276,4.226415094339623
