7960986,2,B000065C34,"Do not expect any of Lynn's great wartime standards. She had just made her first album in Nashville and the bare half dozen songs she sings are primarily beautifully enunciated Patsy Cline covers. The other disappointment (for me) is that she allows her Guest Star (the great pianist George Shearing) to play 4 or 5 numbers in a row with his jazz ensemble, which means that only about 20-30 minutes of this 40 minute tape actually feature Dame Vera. She is lovely, of course, but this is NOTa DVD I will ever play again.",1441843200,,520,4.542553191489362
