4513933,5,B0050BPZHM,I have really enjoyed watching this season of Girls Next Door! I love every second of it!,1409788800,,89,4.294117647058823
4513934,5,B0050BPZHM,I am a newbie to the GND and I have to admit I love this show!!! I am going to say that Bridget is my favorite girl on this show!!! She is real and cute!!!,1369785600,,155,3.4571428571428573
4513935,3,B0050BPZHM,"Just had to say this, If you watch when Bridget gets her drink on... she has drunken lazy eye/s! It's ever slight but there.",1364083200,2,124,4.208333333333333
4513936,5,B0050BPZHM,Something to watch to just get a laugh out of when your stressed out and just want to not think about anything. Bought from a seller and it came in great shape. Discs looked like new.,1363478400,,183,4.111111111111111
4513937,4,B0050BPZHM,it came very fast and with no complications. price was cheaper than in a store. ive never had an issue with dvd purchases.,1357948800,,122,4.3478260869565215
4513938,3,B0050BPZHM,I loved this show when it was aired on the E network and I  expected this DVD would be just like the episodes they aired on TV BUT they were all uncensored which I am NOT happy about. I always have to cover my eyes when certain scenes come up which is kinda anoying! I love this show so much BUT I do think there should be a option to blur nudity or to watch uncensored but beside that lovely box set just hate the uncensored nudity!,1309910400,,433,3.9770114942528734
4513939,2,B0050BPZHM,"I bought this for my girlfriend because she finds the show entertaining. I tried to watch it with her but I can't stand it. Bridgette is cool, Kendra is massively annoying and Holly is possibly one of the fakest people on the planet.

This will appeal to females only and if you are a male and get stuck watching it with your girl one day, well hopefully its the episode where you get to see Bridgette mostly nude popping out of a birthday cake. Otherwise theres not much this show can offer you.",1299024000,5,496,4.333333333333333
4513940,5,B0050BPZHM,1 of the best tv shows i have seen i normally don't watch reality shows but i really liked the first 5 seasons of this show and i own the first 3 still need to get 4 and 5 to have all of the first 5 which is the best of them have not seen season 6 yet will rent it form netflix  when it comes out.,1280534400,,297,3.4328358208955225
4513941,5,B0050BPZHM,"The Girls Next Door season three has a lot of great episodes. The dvd set has very high quality, as well. The menu design is very cute. There is also an option to play all, as opposed to the last two seasons. Definitely buy this item!",1278979200,,234,4.108695652173913
4513942,5,B0050BPZHM,"I am a huge GND fan!  After watching season 4 on TV I decided NOT to buy it.  I want to remember the girls and Hef as they were.

Season 3 is a great series.  To bad all good things have to come to an end.",1236643200,,205,3.391304347826087
4513943,5,B0050BPZHM,"Love this DVD - BIG fan of the girls!
If you're an Aussie and you're concerned about purchasing this DVD due to region restrictions: If you have a multi-region DVD player you will be fine. It worked in a number of DVD players I have tried. (Mostly Pioneer brand). The only problem I had was when I tried to play it in my Laptop with Windows Media Player - the program asked me to change the region of the player in order to play DVD, but warns that after 5 changes region will be set and unable to change, so watch out for that!
AMAZON - EXCELLENT SELLER!!! Always arrives on time and in good condition.",1232236800,,603,4.206896551724138

4513945,5,B0050BPZHM,"I was very pleased and entertained with my purchase of The Girls Next Door Season 3.  I received my DVD 1 day early from my estimated delivery date.  Thank you Amazon for your excellent service.

4513946,5,B0050BPZHM,Girls Next Door r addictive to watch.people r crazy not to buy all the seasons. can't wait for season 4 and 5 to come out!,1217548800,,122,3.92
4513947,5,B0050BPZHM,"It is so much better watching the Season of the Girls Next Door without the Censor cutting everything. The Extra features are Great and the Deleted scenes and very enjoyable. If your a Fan of Holly, Bridget, Kendra and the Hefster then this is a Must Own DVD.",1212019200,5,259,4.416666666666667
4513948,1,B0050BPZHM,"I have never seen a playboy series on cable TV, and wanted to have a peek just for record. What a disaster! I am not sure what people find in this kind of junk. You have to listen to mindless, brainless chatter of three dumb blondes and their pastimes in the playboy mansion and that's it! Not even some decent nudity.",1211587200,9,318,4.229508196721311
4513949,5,B0050BPZHM,"As good as, yet better than the 1st and 2nd series. Highly recommended! Cant wait for the 4th season..",1210982400,,102,4.421052631578948
4513950,5,B0050BPZHM,another great season from the girls next door. The girls are hilarious and they have many new adventures. Highly recommend if you're a fan like me!,1208476800,2,147,4.6923076923076925
4513951,5,B0050BPZHM,"Forget Survivor, Big Brother, or even Top Model, here is a show for all the rest of us to enjoy. What could be better than following around Hugh Hefners girlfriends as they live their charmed lives. Be warned that unlike the TV version, they do show the naughty parts, and language isn't bleeped. It is interesting to see after 3 years of this show the evolution of the girls. Holly taking a more active role with the photo shoots, Bridgette doing a radio show (weekends on XM, but still) and trying out for voice over work, even Kendra buying property to renovate. It even seems Hef is getting out and about more. If I have half his energy at his age I'll be happy.",1207526400,8,666,4.379032258064516
4513952,5,B0050BPZHM,These ladies live life to the fullest and it's such a pleasure to watch them do it. Season 3 is just as fabulous and seasons 1 and 2.,1205020800,,133,3.7857142857142856
4513953,5,B0050BPZHM,I love the Girls Next Door. Its such an easy watch. Very intertaining & funny. Makes you wonder....what if!,1204416000,,107,4.684210526315789
4513954,4,B0050BPZHM,"The girls are back and better than ever. The season kicks off with a snowy Christmas at the Mansion and ends with the Playmate of the Year luncheon. This season also includes: The Renaissance Faire, snowboarding in Vail with Shaun White, Valentines and Mardi Gras celebrations, a calender photo shoot, and race car driving. It also includes Bedtime Stories: The Best of The Girls Next Door which is very funny and entertaining.",1203638400,4,427,4.944444444444445
4513955,5,B0050BPZHM,"Season 3 is just as good as the previous two, full of laughs. Wish there were more episodes included. The deleted scenes are great. I'd definitely recommend it.",1203379200,,160,4.75
4513956,5,B0050BPZHM,Girls Next Door season 3 arrived at my home in great condition. I watched all 3 disks and they are perfect. I'm a big fan of the Girls Next Door. I have all 3 seasons on DVD and I even have their exercise DVD.,1203292800,,209,3.772727272727273
4513957,5,B0050BPZHM,"This is a great dvd set. In their third season, the girls and Hef have finally warmed up to the camera, the initial awkwardness they had is now gone. They and staff have all gotten used to having a crew following them around.
Each episode shows a little more of Hef. Looking quite dashing in his smoking jackets.
Great DVD for couples looking for that little bit of endulgence and extravagance.",1202860800,4,394,4.563380281690141
4513958,5,B0050BPZHM,The DVD's were in great condition. Once the 4th season comes out I will certainly be buying it from here.,1202860800,,105,4.3
4513959,5,B0050BPZHM,"It's about time to review the dvd's now that they have come out.

I've been a fan of the girls next door for quite some time now and I must say that the fans of this show are getting luckier and luckier.
Not only are the girls gorgeous, the lifestyle to die for and the entertainment non stop but it doesn't seem to ever get old, the first season was awesome, the second more so and the third even better. (Though I must say it does have my least favorite episode of all times in it, the other episodes make up for it.)

The DVD's contain all aired episodes of the third season, with deleted scenes attached to all episodes (something I love to watch, it just gives you a little something extra from the girls lives.) and the best part in my view, commentary by Holly Bridget and Kendra on all episodes which is, like many have said before, like twice the episode and adding to the episodes over-all quality.

Other special features include the hour long ""Bedtime stories"" special where the girls all sat down in Hef's bed an discussed their favorite moments from the first two seasons, the season 3 trailer which aired on E! when the season first started in march 2007 and a few Easter eggs on disks 1 and 3.

It's not an overstatement when I say that Holly Bridget and Kendra changed my life and to me the Girls next door is the gift that keeps on giving with entertaining episodes but more importantly endearing characters of 3 lovely ladies who know how to live life to the fullest...

You go girls!",1201478400,16,1503,4.372759856630824
4513960,5,B0050BPZHM,"I haven't seen the DVD either but I saw all the shows. (thanks to my DVR)
These three are just fun. The steady reliable Holly, Hef's no. 1. The emotional sweet Bridgette and the ghetto not too bright Kendra with a body to die for. Of course there is  Hugh Hefner.  He reminds me of Tom Bombadil in the Lord of the Rings.  Happy go lucky and nothing negative sticks to those silk pajamas he wears all day",1198627200,4,403,4.141025641025641
8451027,5,B0050BPZHM,But- it!!! Wonderful,1520985600,,20,6.0
8451028,4,B0050BPZHM,"Well, I have the coolest wife in the world because she has become a big fan of Playboy and Hugh Hefner. This series is part of the reason. She loves the girls, especially Bridget and gets a huge kick out of their pets and daily routines. Kendra is the most sexy but she's my least favorite because of her lack of class and attitude that to me seems to indicate she takes her incredible good fortune for granted. Holly is my favorite because not only is she beautiful but also smart and seems to genuinely appreciate Hugh's generosity.",1517529600,,534,4.459183673469388

8451031,5,B0050BPZHM,"I bought my copy Used from a seller who didn't even include 1 of the 3 discs which was really dissapointing. The episodes I got though were awesome and I LOVE the exciting, fun fantasy of this show! These girls really know how to captivate you and keep the viewers entertained!",1492992000,,277,4.450980392156863

8451034,5,B0050BPZHM,"For some reason, this was my favorite of the seasons.  I love this show! Def my biggest guilty pleasure! This season seems to focus more on real fun, as opposed to structured fun for playboy.",1452470400,,191,4.457142857142857
